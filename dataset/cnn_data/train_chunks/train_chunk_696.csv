The last time he was in the music charts he scored a number one hit with a cheesy offering after pairing himself with pink Mr Blobby. Twenty years on and 64-year-old Noel Edmonds has returned -  this time with a raunchy track that has turned into a club anthem. The Deal Or No Deal star has become a chart star with a track titled Are You Ready? under the name Candice Cannes – the mannequin he drives with in his private taxi to stop punters flagging it down. Scroll down for video . Deal Or No Deal star Noel Edmonds (pictured left in 1976) has become a chart star with a track titled Are You Ready? under the name Candice Cannes - the mannequin he drives with in his taxi (right) He uses the dummy to stop passengers from flagging him down as he beats the queues by using bus lanes . The techno track has been mixed by DJ Mark Loverush and he has sampled some well known catchphrases from Channel 4’s Deal Or No Deal. 'You can ask me the question,' giggles a suggestive female voice. 'Are you ready for the question?' booms Noel. 'I hope it’s a big one,' she says, adding 'What’s in your box?... It’s quite a big box.' Mr Edmonds told The Sun on Sunday the driving force for the track was his wife, make-up artist Liz Davies, 41. He . said: ‘I recorded a few lines but Liz is the brains behind it. I . decided to bounce it off a few experts to see what the reaction was. That’s how it started. ‘Liz was adamant it wasn’t under her name as she didn’t want to be seen as hanging off my coat-tails.’ The club anthem features suggestive catchphrases from the presenter's programme, Deal Or No Deal . The CD and video feature a blonde woman with angel wings. Miss Davies said the idea for the track originated after she was given studio time as a gift: ‘We were having a laugh. It’s grown beyond anything we expected.’ This is Edmonds’ first hit record since he teamed up with Mr Blobby to get to the top of the charts in December 20 years ago. Mr Blobby was a character on Noel Edmonds’ Saturday night variety television show Noel’s House Party. A bulbous pink figure covered with yellow spots he sported a permanent toothy grin, jiggling eyes and communicated only by saying the word 'blobby' in an electronically altered voice.

A week later, 'Babe' by Take That bumped it off 1, but only for a week. It returned to the top spot on the charts on Christmas Day and remained there for another 2 weeks. This single also became the first song to leave the 1 position then return to it since 1968. The single later received the dubious honour of being voted the most annoying Christmas no 1 single according to the yearly HMV poll.","Hasn't been in charts since cheesy offering with Mr Blobby 20 years ago .

It opened in the West Midlands with a blaze of publicity, but within weeks it had been dubbed the art world's 'Pink Elephant'. Now The Public, a £72million black and pink themed gallery in West Bromwich, is to close just five years after it opened. The reason is clear - The Public simply couldn't attract the Great British public. The Public in West Bromwich has been consigned to history after it was closed by Sandwell Council . As a result, Sandwell Council have had to pull the venue's annual £1.6million subsidy. Now the site will be transformed into a sixth form college. Plans for the gallery had been hailed as one of Britain's largest and most ambitious . cultural building projects, at the centrepiece of a £500million . regeneration of the town. But when it opened in 2008 there was a storm of controversy. The project was more than £32million over budget, it opened three years late and in the weeks after it did open, it was beset by technical problems which prevented it from charging . visitors. Even the free concerts put on at the venue to bring people in attracted few visitors. One performance, by the soul singer Aisha, drew an audience of just 17 . people. Originally planned to open in 2005, The Public had problems from the beginning. Six months into . construction architect Will Alsop went into receivership. The gallery had been hailed as one of Britain's largest and most ambitious cultural building projects, at the centrepiece of a £500million regeneration of the town . The Public went way over budget and costs spiraled to £72million as it was built - then it was best by technical problems . New architects were appointed but in 2006 the project was put into administration when the budget spiraled. After . 18 months the administrators decided that the building should be . finished and the project was transferred to the direct control of . Sandwell Council. On Saturday, the venue finally attracted a bumper crowd as thousands of people turned out to say goodbye to the 'Pink Elephant'. Margaret Donnelly, a 46-year-old nurse from Smethwick, told the Express & Star: 'It is absolutely devastating. In my view The Public is one of the best things to have happened to West Bromwich. 'I have come to see a lot of events and shows and they have all been fantastic. It has also been a great place to bring children to learn new things. 'I think it a very sad day for the town.' Rozie White, a 47-year-old artist from Gorsty Hill, Rowley Regis, said she had exhibited works at the venue and was 'gutted’ to see it go. 'The decision to close The Public now makes no sense. With the completion of New Square this is the time the venue is most needed. Instead it is being shut. 'I can’t help but think if a building like this had been in another area, such as Birmingham, it would have been saved but because it is in West Bromwich it isn’t.' Sandwell Mayor Linda Horton said: 'I was here at the opening when many were very much against even the idea of an arts centre in Sandwell and branded it complete nonsense. 'Now we are here to celebrate its life and mourn its passing as many are now so very much for the idea of an arts centre in Sandwell. 'We have gone full circle in a very short time.' Sandwell Council leader Darren Cooper said: 'I've been charged by the people of Sandwell to protect front-line services, and that is what I am trying to do. 'It's a difficult decision, I'm sorry that we're having to make this decision, and I do appreciate why some people are upset.'","The Public was meant to cost £40m, but costs spiraled to £72m .

Three teenagers accused of brutally raping and beating a 16-year-old girl so badly that she broke bones in her face and bled from her ear will be charged as adults. The minors are part of a gang of two girls and three boys arrested following the incident at a house in Hollywood, Florida on November 1. Police were able to identify all five of the teenagers allegedly involved because one of the accused took video of the fight and sexual assault on their cell phone. Accused: Erica Avery, right, and Dwight Henry, left, are two of three teenagers that have been charged as adults after they helped to strip and held the 16-year-old girl victim down while Woolfork forced himself on her . Two of the teenagers - Erica Avery, 16, and Dwight Henry, 17, - made their first court appearances on Sunday, appearing via video feed from separate lock-ups. They helped to strip the victim and held her down while another member of the gang forced himself on their victim. Both are expected to be back in court on Monday for a judge to approve the appointment of counsel. Avery and Henry, along with Patricia Montes, 15, of Hollywood, were each charged with two counts of felony sexual battery and two counts of kidnapping. They, along with adults Jayvon Woolfork, 19, and Lanel Singleton, 18, are accused of luring the 16-year-old girl to Woolfork's home where they beat her and forced her to have sex with Woolfork. All five defendants must have their own lawyer and are understood to be seeking public defenders.

For many, a trip to Disney is the holiday of a lifetime, but what if you decided to spend your lifetime at Disney? There is a select group of people for whom this idea is no fantasyland, but a reality. The Walt Disney Company has created a gated community known as Golden Oak - named after the company's California ranch. It’s the only place in the world where homeowners actually live on Disney park property. Scroll Down for Video . Cinderella's Castle: How about living in a castle of your own on park property? Disney has created Golden Oak where you can live immersed in the Disney magic... forever! Living the fairytale: Disney has plans to build 450 homes at Golden Oak, and out of the 100 that have been built so far, virtually all have been sold. The starting price is $1.7 million and can be as expensive as $7 million . Premium location: The perks include park passes, door-to-park transportation, extended hours for visiting attractions . Some 980 acres have been set aside for the company to build up to 450 homes at Lake Buena Vista – some within eyesight of the famous Cinderella Castle fireworks. Of course, living in the vacation capital of the world doesn’t come cheap. Houses start at $1.7 million with some homes selling for more than $7million. On top of the sale price there are extras that homeowners must pay including property taxes and annual fees as high as $12,000 to cover benefits. The perks include park passes, door-to-park transportation, extended hours for visiting attractions such as the Magic Kingdom and Epcot, and a 17,000-square-foot clubhouse with a restaurant and concierge. Disney magic: The homes exude luxury but they also have been Disney-fied with some homes incorporating Mickey shaped windows or even swimming pools . Set for Hollywood: Residents also will have access to some of the amenities, including the spa and dining rooms at the $370million, 444-room Four Seasons resort scheduled to open in Golden Oak next summer . Residents also will have access to some of the amenities, including the spa and dining rooms at the $370 million, 444-room Four Seasons resort scheduled to open in Golden Oak next summer. Brazillians make up a number of the . Disneyphiles who have come to purchase the homes. Although some are . vacation houses, a number have decided to settle there permanently. Sam . Bergami of Milford, Connecticut, had visited Walt Disney World Resort . near Orlando, Florida, more than 300 times since 1976. Now, he lives . there. Hot ticket: Of the 100 total homes, there are just a few that remain on the market . Orderly: Even after paying a small fortune to own the property, builders and residents are subject to numerous restrictions as front doors have to be made of solid wood and gutters must be copper . He bought his $3.4 million Spanish-style home in January 2012. ‘I've traveled everywhere, pretty much all over Europe,’ says the 69-year-old told the Wall Street Journal. ‘I always gravitate to Disney World. It's the place where I'm most comfortable.’ Inside, the homes exude luxury but they also have been Disney-fied with some homes incorporating Mickey shaped windows or even swimming pools. Homeowners can even add ‘hidden Mickeys’ where the characters’ distinctive head and ears are integrated into door panels, railings and garden landscapes. Some are so hard to spot that owners are given a map of all of the locations. As you might expect with a company as protective over its brand as Disney, there are just seven builders who are allowed to construct the houses in Golden Oak. Even after paying a small fortune to own the property, builders and residents are subject to numerous restrictions. Front doors have to be solid wood. Shutters must open and close. Even gutters most be rounded and made from copper. Living the dream: This is Disney's Tuscan village courtyard home, one of several architectural styles featured in the unique community .

Gina and Paul Rice, of Warrenton, Virginia built their Tuscan-style, five-bedroom, 9,000-square-foot home, complete with fireworks viewing tower so they could see the nightly fireworks displays. ‘If there's a single image that you think of with Disney, it's those fireworks,’ says Mr. Rice, 60. ‘It's just a very cool way to remind yourself you're rolling in the belly of all this stuff.’ They didn’t request for any Hidden Mickeys to be included in the design of their house but ended up with 13 anyway with a head and ears molded into the fireplace and even also in the swimming pool. Homes at Golden Oak went on sale more . than 2½ years ago but after the property market in Florida took a dive . there things are beginning to recover. Although . there is space for 450 individual lots at Golden Oak, to date, Disney . have only released built two phases with homes for sale.

Now they both live there in a $3.4 million home . The site won't be completely finished for a few more years. It’s not the first time the company has decided to enter the real estate market. In the 1990s it created Celebration, Florida – a 5,000 acre town with more than 4,000 homes. Disney is only involved at arm-length in terms of running the community which is now controlled by the residents. Disney say with Golden Oak, they wanted to create a resort community that would appeal to families and also focus on the theme park too. They realised there was also demand for bigger homes. ‘The Disney brand goes a long way. You're paying for location, you're paying for the amenities,’ says Michael Crawford, an agent with Keller Williams at the Lakes in Celebration, Fla. ‘There's a lot of added value.’ Celebration: It's not the first time Disney has made a foray into the property market.

Seven cases of meningitis occurred recently on Princeton University's college campus in New Jersey. School Officials are meeting with the trustees this weekend to discuss whether or not to administer students a vaccination. The vaccination in question is the only Meningococcal that prevents against meningitis group B. The Novartis manufactured vaccination called, Bexsero, may be used in Europe and Australia but has not yet been approved in the United States. Princeton will decide whether or not to administer students a meningitis vaccination that has not yet been approved in the United States . Elizabeth powers, a spokesperson for Novartis said they are working with the Centers for Disease Control and the state Department of Public Health in order to get a vaccine for the school. 'We have filed an Investigational New Drug application for our MenB vaccine in the U.S., but have not yet come to an agreement on a pathway to licensure for this vaccine with regulatory authorities,' Novartis spokeswoman Elizabeth Power told CNN. Martin Mbuga, a spokesman for the Ivy League School, said that the school is working to eradicate the problem as safely as possible. Bexsero is the only vaccine that prevents against the rare type of meningitis B that already infected seven people, one of whom is still hospitalized . The school has been telling students to keep washing their hands, not to share drinks, and to always cover their coughs, reported USA Today. Group B meningitis is a bacterial strain that causes symptoms such as fever, vomiting, stiff neck, headache, confusion, and sensitivity to light. It is characterized as a swelling of the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. If left untreated it can cause permanent brain damage, hearing loss, and lead to limb amputations and death. It can be treated with antibiotics. The type of meningitis spreading over the campus is a very rare form that usually only affects children. A professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University, William Schaffner, told USA Today that 'Usually, when you see this kind of meningitis on the campus, it's meningitis C,"" he said. 'This is very, very unusual.' CNN reported that the first case occurred after a student returned to Campus in March after Spring recess. Two months later, six more students and a visitor contracted the disease. Most of the students recovered except for one student who is currently hospitalized after being diagnosed on Nov.8. The Mail Online got the chance to speak to Dr. Daryl Isaacs, an expert in preventative medicine, clinical diagnosis, and travel medicine. He is currently on staff at New York University School of Medicine, Beth Israel Medical Center, and New York Downtown Hospital. He was also featured as the doctor in the popular film, 'SuperSize Me.' Meningitis is spread by exchanging saliva, sharing drinks, or other respiratory secretions . He told the Mail Online, 'All students should get vaccinated before going to college.' 'It's a disease caused by overcrowding,' he said. 'It spreads anywhere there are people such as in dormitories, cafeterias, and prisons.' He also emphasized the dangers of the disease and called it, 'rapidly spreading and highly fatal.' As for whether or not the school should administer the vaccination to its students, he said 'absolutely.' He said most college students are required to be vaccinated before arriving on campus and if students opt out of the meningitis vaccination then they must sign a waiver. He described the outbreak as 'strange' and attributed it to the fact that the vaccinations students are currently required to receive are 'very effective' but may not prevent this rare form. If the board decides to distribute the vaccine, 8,000 students could be offered the preventative measure.

It was once one of the dirtiest and most polluted rivers in the UK - but the River Tyne is now the best in England and Wales for salmon. Over the past few decades the murky waters of the river have been transformed into a haven for wildlife - including thousands of salmon. A vast improvement in the quality of the previously heavily-polluted water has made as huge difference to conditions for the fish, combined with the introduction of baby salmon - or parr - from a nearby hatchery. Salmon leaping upstream on the River Tyne, which according to the latest reports is the best salmon fishing river in England and Wales .

Images of salmon leaping up the fresh waters of the River Tyne are a far cry from pictures showing the river's grim industrial past. For centuries the river was choked with filth because it was used as a major route for the export of coal, from the 13th century until the decline of the coal mining industry in north-east of England in the second half of the 20th century. Anne Woodcock, of FishPal, which sells day passes for fishing on the river, said: 'The grading of rivers is based on statistical evidence obtained from Fish Counters and Catch Results of the number of salmon running the river.

When retired oil executive David Pooley decided to pour hundreds of thousands of pounds into restoring a dead Norfolk broad, he thought the local authority would be delighted with his efforts. The retired 64-year-old spent three years working with a team of people working on the beauty spot for the benefit of this local community. But now the Broads Authority are threatening to prosecute him because he restored Sotshole Broad in Ranworth, Norfolk, without planning permission and left the site 'suburbanised'. Beauty spot: David Pooley, pictured with parish council chairman Peter Crook (left), has been told he should not have installed this quay heading without permission . Dredged: This 2005 picture shows the small patch of water at Sotshole Broad before the dredging work was carried out.  Now the water stretches as far as the red line after Mr Pooley invested hundreds of thousands. There is a small island in the middle which is used by birds . The father-of-two said he did not know he needed approval to put down a quay heading and boardwalk on the 60-acre site. But he insists the work was needed to restore the site to its former glory - and given the choice he would rather have not spent so much money on it. Mr Pooley bought the site near his home in 2005 when he retired from working in the oil industry. Although the site is privately owned, he happily lets friends and villagers walk their dogs on the land and opens the doors to everyone for three weeks a year. He wants to open the beauty spot up for everyone to use but has been put off because he would have to jump through bureaucratic hoops and build toilets, get insurance and have disabled access. Mr Pooley, of South Walsham, Norfolk, . insists the wooden quay heading is only there to hold up the bank while . the paths and boardwalk are to give him vital access to manage the . woodland. He said that the rundown site was practically lifeless four years ago but is now teeming with otters, fish and birds. The benefactor, who lets the public in on . open days as well as for the bluebell walk, has won unanimous backing . from South Walsham Parish Council. Dispute: . The benefactor, left, was also told this decking should not have been . put down through the woodland. Mr Pooley insists it was needed for . access as the ground beneath is boggy and unsafe to walk through . Beauty spot: Work had not been carried out on the 60 acre site for the last 50 years when Mr Pooley decided to pour his own money into the project . Row: Mr Pooley said wildlife had practically deserted the site before he carried out restoration work . Council chairman Peter Crook said: . 'Local residents have been interested to see the scheme progress and . everyone is astounded that the Broads Authority has threatened legal . action.' Mr Pooley has lived in the area for 26 years, although he spent much of his career in Africa and the Middle East, and wanted to give something back to his community. He said: 'I am told I should have had planning permission but I didn't know that. There is no reason I should have known. 'I was in conversation with the Broads Authority about doing the work and they didn't mention it. They told me it was a different department responsible - I thought it was a scene straight out of Yes Minister. 'When I started, the whole site was . totally inaccessible. The water was only 6ins deep and the broad was . totally dead.There were no fish or anything.

Labour of love: Mr Pooley, 64, said he would open the site up to the public if it was not for the bureaucratic hoops he had to leap through . 'We have taken three years to dig it . out to a depth of 3ft to 4ft. It is now teeming with fish, including . pike, and there are otters and kingfishers about. 'Swans have nested for the past three years and my neighbour Charles Cator has mentioned birds that I have never even heard of.' He said that restoring the site was 'something he wanted to do' in his retirement, and he was told no work had been carried out for the last 40 or 50 years. The work has cost him 'several hundred thousand' to do, although he refused to be drawn on the exact total. Mr Pooley bought the site from Fairhaven Garden in 2005 after he left his job as part-owner of an engineering company in the Middle East. Over a three-year period, Sotshole Broad was magnificently restored to its dimensions shown on an old Victorian map from 1886. Beauty spot: Mr Pooley, a former oil executive, has lived in the area for the last 26 years and wanted to put something back into the community . Mr Pooley said Broads Authority . officers had approached him in 2008. And after inspecting the broad in a . rowing boat, and finding it devoid of life apart from lilies and reeds, . they suggested they could work with him to restore it with the help of . government funding. But the organisation told him a year later that the cash was being used on other larger projects. A report by the Broads Authority planning committee said they would seek authority to 'prosecute the owner in the event that the enforcement notice (to remove the quay heading and boardwalk) is not complied with. Andrea Long, director of planning and strategy at the Broads Authority, said: 'Sotshole Broad is in an isolated, remote and unspoilt location and we feel that the additional hard edged quay heading and boardwalks are inappropriate for the area. 'The Broads Authority always tries to resolve these matters through negotiation rather than taking formal action.' She said they were happy the broad had been dredged and were not asking Mr Pooley to fill it back in. But he has now been advised to apply for retrospective planning permission concerning the rest of the work he has done on the site.","David Pooley, 64, bought Sotshole Broad in 2005 when he retired .

This autumn's harvest is set to be one of the biggest and best-tasting ever. British apples are some of the sweetest and most colourful for years, according to Richard Capper, who has just begun the harvest at Stocks Farm in Suckley, Worcestershire. 'The good weather and summer heat has upped the sugar levels in the fruit,' explained Mr Capper, who expects to haul in almost 2,000 tons of the fruit from his orchards. Gala, Bramley and Braeburn apples from the farm's 100 acres will be sold to all the major UK supermarkets after they have been gathered by a team of 36 pickers over ten days.

Richard Benyon, MP for Newbury and the ex Tory water minister, said he was thankful for the rain last summer as the UK 'dodged a bullet' Britain was saved from using standpipes thanks to the Jubilee downpours last year, the former Tory water minister has said. Richard Benyon, MP for Newbury, has said he felt immense relief last year when it started raining just before the Queen's celebrations began because we were just a few months from 'humiliation as a country'. The Environment Agency had told him during the summer that there was just a three per cent chance of enough rain falling to refill the nation's reservoirs. In an interview with The Observer, he said: 'I immediately thought of the jubilee and the Olympics, . thinking: 'How are we going to do this? 'Thames Water assured me there . would be enough water for the Olympic Village, and all the activities . and the hotels, but it would be at a price. 'London would have looked . awful: brown parks, prematurely leafless trees; there could have been . very serious water restrictions in parts of the south-east, such as . Sussex. 'We knew . we were facing a serious problem. And then it rained and we dodged a . bullet. That was extraordinary.' The deluge started just before the Queen's Jubilee flotilla celebrations, and continued into winter, only pausing for the Olympics. Benyon's said his comments were made to stop the short term thinking that has dominated the recent debate over bringing down water bills. The Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations last year were marked by the largest flotilla seen on the Thames in 350 years as well as torrential rain which lead to the wettest June on record . In total 548 people had to be check for hypothermia after the flotilla finished due to the weather . He said: 'Household bills are obviously important. But for heaven's sake, I really hope we can link the need to keep bills lower with the need for investment and protection of the environment. 'The investment tap can be really quickly turned off if international sovereign wealth funds and pensions funds, who quite like our regulated sector at the moment, think some of the language being used by politicians makes it not the sector in which they want to invest.' He called for more water meters to be imposed in people's homes, increased investment in new reservoirs and greater connectivity between existing water storage. He also said there should be a crackdown on the cheap option of companies draining the nation's rivers to meet shortages in supply. Benyon says before the downpour started he was warned the country was just months away from having to use standpipes in London leading to 'humiliation as a country' The MP called for more water meters and investment in reservoirs, and said that debates about bringing down water bills could scare off investors . The 1,000 boat flotilla which sailed down the Thames last June was the most spectacular event to be held on the river for 350 years. However high winds and heavy rain caused some problems, especially among the Royal College of Music Chamber Choir who sang Land of Hope and Glory along with the national anthem while pulling soggy strands of hair from their faces. In fact the weather was so bad that paramedics checked them over for hypothermia once they were back on dry land. In total 548 people were checked for signs of the condition, brought about by extreme cold. According to the Met Office, June last year was the wettest since records began in 1910, with 145.3mm of rainfall recorded, more than twice as much as normal. It was also the second dullest, with just 119.2 hours of sunshine - the record of 115.4 hours was in 1987.","Richard Benyon was water minister during last year's drought .

Governors of Britain's first Muslim free school may have conflicting links with suppliers . and £20,000 of 'irregular payments' have been discovered in its . accounts, a leaked Government audit has revealed. The Department for Education (DfE) is to hold talks with the Al-Madinah school in Derby, just weeks after it was branded 'dysfunctional' and 'inadequate' by Ofsted inspectors. The DfE report, obtained by Channel 4 News, says some governors at 'are closely involved with suppliers to the school either directly or through family connections'. Struggling: Governors from the troubled Al-Madinah free school in Derby (pictured) are to meet with Government officials today after a leaked report revealed they may have conflicts of interest . The audit, published in September, also said the Muslim faith school 'cannot currently demonstrate that it is maintaining proper accounting records' and revealed that auditors had identified 'irregular payments' of almost £20,000, according to the broadcaster. Rules: A member of staff from the school, where female teachers were told to wear headscarves . Last month the school was placed in special measures, and Shazia Parveen, the chair of governors, announced she was to step down from her position. Education Minister Lord Nash will today meet the governors of the school to decide on its future. Channel 4 News said the DfE's leaked audit said the school had been left with a 'complicated' governance situation after the resignations of the principal, vice principal and business manager. According to the audit, those who had conflicts of interest are reported to be one former governor and one current governor whose companies supplied the school, one governor with relatives working as suppliers to the school and another governor with a relative working at the school. It found further potential conflicts with one governor whose company provides HR services to the school. There was also found to be no complete record of expenditure or receipts from September 2012 to August this year. The report also exposed gaps in policies at the school, which it said had no guidance on what travel expenses or meals could be claimed. Ofsted's report, published last month, condemned the running of the school, concluding that the governing body is ineffective and had failed to appreciate how poor pupils' experiences are. It stated: 'The basic systems and processes a school needs to operate well are not in place. The school is in chaos and reliant on the goodwill of an interim principal to prevent it totally collapsing.' Al-Madinah, which has been criticised following claims it discriminated against women, required staff to cover their hair regardless of their religion, and made girls sit at the back of the class, was rated inadequate in each of the categories Ofsted examines. Al-Madinah, which is one of the Government's flagship free schools and is run by the Al- Madinah Education Trust, opened last September. On its website it describes 'a strong Muslim ethos' with shorter holidays and longer school days 'to maximise opportunities for pupil achievement and success'. Criticism: The report of the Ofsted inspection rated Al-Madinah as 'inadequate' on every criterion last month . A DfE spokesman said: 'Lord Nash wrote to Shazia Parveen, the Chair of the Al-Madinah Trust, on October 8 placing 17 requirements on the Trust, which they must satisfy or risk their Funding Agreement being terminated. The last of those deadlines has now passed. 'We are actively considering the responses from the Trust. It would be inappropriate to go into any further detail at this stage.' Britain's first Muslim free school, Al-Madinah, opened in September last year but since then has been dogged by criticism. According to . the former head teacher and his deputy, who claim they were forced to leave, it is . controlled by religious hardliners who ban children from singing or . reading fairy tales and force staff to wear headscarves. Andrew . Cutts-McKay resigned from his role as head in August, two months after his number two Suzanne Southerland stepped . down from her post. Both allege they were 'bullied and sidelined' by members of the school's trust, which is predominantly Muslim. The . school strongly denies the pair's claims. When it emerged Ofsted found the school inadequate last month David Cameron admitted: 'I am not afraid to shut the school'.

A Florida mother will find out today if she will go to jail over the tragic death or her two-year-old daughter who was found dead in her bed after swallowing an oxycodone pill. Tiffany Mitchell, 29, of Spring Hill, could face as many as 13 years in prison for the death of Kaylynn two years ago. Prosecutors say Mitchell left an oxycodone pill on her nightstand and that the brown-haired, blue-eyed girl found and swallowed it while Mitchell was taking a shower. Kaylynn was found dead in her bed on January 31, 2011. Scroll down for video... 'Guilty': Tiffany Mitchell, 29, of Spring Hill, Florida, awaits sentencing today after pleading guilty in the death of her daughter Kaylynn, 2, who was found dead in her bed after eating an oxycodone pill . Tragic: Kaylynn is thought to have found her mother's oxycodone pill on the nightstand and swallowed it while Mitchell was taking a shower . Mitchell pleaded guilty last month to charges of aggravated manslaughter of a child. Her lack of a criminal record made it possible to cap her sentence at 13 years, but Mitchell says she must accept responsibility in Kaylynn's death. ‘I shouldn't have ever brought a pill like that into my house,’ she told Tampa Bay Times. The devastated mother, who also has two sons, Shawn, 10, and Dylan, 8, said the sentencing would not change the way she feels about the accident. ‘Whether it's probation or prison, I'll suffer every day for the rest of my life.’ The prosecutor said a prison term is justified, but is struggling to decide on how many years she should get. ‘There's no formula you get to follow,’ said Assistant State Attorney Donald 'Sonny' McCathran. ‘These are the cases that are a lot harder to call,’ he told Tampa Bay Times. 'Blue': The girl was found dead by her mother the next morning, who said her body was all blue and cold . Devastated: Mitchell says regardless of the sentencing, she will 'suffer every day for the rest of my life' The day before her daughter died, Mitchell picked up Kaylynn in Brooksville after she had spent two days at her father's home. The father, Kraig . Broshears, 32, of Brooksville, says he forgives Mitchell, but that 13 . years in prison isn't long enough. ‘She . took a life by being irresponsible. She'll have time with her boys when . she gets out. I have to wake up every day and not see my daughter's . face,' he told Tampa Bay Times. Mitchell and a boyfriend took the children shopping, had dinner and went out for ice cream. At . her mobile home south of Brooksville, Mitchell tucked Kaylynn into bed . and put on a Dora the Explorer movie. Mitchell took a shower and checked . on Kaylynn about 10. She seemed fine. The night before: Kaylynn had been tucked into bed by her mother who put on a Dora the Explorer movie for her. She was found dead the next morning with high levels of oxycodone in her system . About 6am the next day, Mitchell found Kaylynn blue and cold to the touch. Paramedics could not revive her. The following month, a preliminary medical examiner's report showed Kaylynn had a high level of oxycodone in her system and so a criminal investigation began. ‘I was devastated,’ Mitchell said. ‘For months, I wanted to know what happened to her, and I almost didn't believe it.’ She told detectives she got an 80-milligram oxycodone pill from the boys' paternal grandmother for menstrual cramps. She said she left the pill on the nightstand in her bedroom and took a shower. When she came out, it was gone. The . state Department of Children and Families sought a court order to place . her two sons in protective custody. The judge denied the petition. The father: Kraig Broshears, 32, of Brooksville, pictured here with his daughter, says he forgives Mitchell but that 13 years in prison isn't long enough . Upset: Broshears said his ex-girlfriend, Mitchell, took his daughter's life because she was 'irresponsible' Mitchell admits she used to smoke marijuana and occasionally took oxycodone but insists she's not addicted to painkillers. Mark Tousignant, who helped raise Mitchell since age 12, said she is a caring, responsible mother. ‘She's their rock,’ he said. ‘She's never been in a state of mind where she can't take care of her children or herself.’ Mitchell was arrested July 12, 2011 . 'Works hard': Mitchell, center, with her sons Shawn, 10, right, and Dylan, 8, at their home in Spring Hill. The boys said their mother worked hard for them . The youngest boy, Dylan, said of his mother that she ‘works hard for us'. Mitchell was with the boys' father, Max Snyder of Spring Hill, for nine years. If Mitchell goes to prison, her sister Angel will assume her role. ‘I know she would treat them just as I do and give them the love that they need,’ said Mitchell.","Tiffany Mitchell, 29, of Spring Hill, awaits sentencing today after pleading guilty in the death of daughter, Kaylynn .

A teenage murderer hanged himself just days after being jailed at one of Britain’s highest security prisons. Imran Douglas, 18, faced a minimum of 18 years behind bars for the horrific killing of a bed-ridden pensioner. His victim Margery Gilbey, 88, was found covered in blood at her sheltered accommodation in Shadwell, East London, earlier this year. Imran Douglas, 18, was found dead in his cell, five days after he was sentenced to a minimum of 18 years behind bars for the murder of 88-year-old Margery Gilbey (right) Douglas, a convicted thief who had been expelled from six schools, was sentenced to life by an Old Bailey judge earlier this month. But five days later, guards entered his cell at Belmarsh Prison in South East London and discovered his body. Family members initially suspected he may have been the victim of an attack after being targeted by other prisoners. But the Met confirmed there were no suspicious circumstances and the case has been passed to a coroner. A post mortem investigation found he died of injuries consistent with suicide by hanging. Douglas strangled and stabbed Mrs Gilbey, known as Madge, in the neck before ransacking her room and leaving her to die. He deliberately targeted his defenceless victim, a former café cook described as an ‘old-fashioned East Ender’. The previous day he visited the care home and talked his way inside by pretending to be the grandson of another resident. After fatally wounding her he rummaged through her drawers with blood on his hands before running off when a nurse arrived. Douglas' body was found in his cell at the high-security Belmarsh Prison in South East London . Mrs Gilbey's son Alan, 55, from nearby Bethnal Green, arrived with her favourite fish and chip supper just as staff were raising the alarm. In an emotional tribute, he said she the 'kindest most gentle person' who was liked by everyone she met. He added: 'I can’t believe what has happened.’ Detectives identified Douglas from CCTV images and arrested him at the children's home where he lived the same day. There they found his clothes covered in blood in a laundry basket and a bag on his bed which had the pensioner’s blood on it. Sentencing him, Judge John Bevan QC said the murder was ‘wholly gratuitous’ and a crime at the ‘top end of the scale of gravity’. ‘You used a knife to attack a defenceless and vulnerable old lady in the privacy of her own home, on premises you must have seen to be sheltered accommodation,’ he said. A Met spokesman confirmed that police are investigating the death of Douglas. He said: ‘A special post-mortem examination gave cause of death as injuries consistent with self-suspension. The death is being treated as non-suspicious.’ A  Prison Service spokesman said: ‘Imran Douglas was found unresponsive in his cell by prison staff around 9.20am on Wednesday November 13. ‘Prison staff attempted CPR and paramedics attended but he was pronounced dead at 9.45am. ‘As with all deaths in custody, the Independent Prisons and Probation Ombudsman will conduct an investigation.’","Imran Douglas, 18, was found dead in his cell at Belmarsh Prison in London .

"PUBLISHED: . 07:36 EST, 31 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:22 EST, 31 October 2012 . A Chinese government think tank has urged the country's leaders to start phasing out its one-child policy immediately and allow two children for every family by 2015. The unpopular restriction - which has been in place since 1980 - has led to millions fewer births, but also contributed to the ageing of China's huge population. The proposal is being given extra weight because it has been put forward by the China Development Research Foundation which is close to the government's central leadership. Treasured: China's one-child policy has been criticised in a government report. The a body close to the Chinese Government has called for the system to be phased out during the next few years (file picture) The official Xinhua News Agency said the . foundation recommends a two-child policy be permitted in some provinces from this . year and nationwide by 2015. Xie Meng, a press affairs official with the foundation, said the final version of the report wil be released 'in a week or two.' But Chinese state media have been given advance copies. It proposes all birth limits be dropped by 2020, Xinhua reported. 'China has paid a huge political and social cost for the policy, as it has resulted in social conflict, high administrative costs and led indirectly to a long-term gender imbalance at birth,' Xinhua said, citing the report. But it remains unclear whether Chinese leaders are ready to take up the recommendations. Some experts have also warned that the gradual approach, . if implemented, would still be insufficient to help correct the . problems that China's strict birth limits have created. China's National Population and Family Planning Commission had no immediate comment on the report today. Ageing: China's population is now aging fast following decades of birth restrictions (file picture) Known to many as the one-child policy, China's actual birth-restriction rules are more complicated. The government limits most urban couples to one child, and allows two children for rural families if their first-born is a girl. There are numerous other exceptions as well, including looser rules for minority families and a two-child limit for parents who are themselves both singletons. Cai Yong, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, said the report holds extra weight because the think tank is under the State Council, China's Cabinet. He said he found it remarkable that state-backed demographers were willing to publicly propose such a detailed schedule and plan on how to get rid of China's birth limits. 'That tells us at least that policy change is inevitable, it's coming,' said Mr Yong, who was not involved in the drafting of the report but knows many of the experts who were. 'It's coming, but we cannot predict when exactly it will come,' he said. Adding to the uncertainty is a once-in-a-decade leadership transition that kicks off week that will see a new slate of top leaders installed by spring 2013. Mr Yong said the transition could keep population reform on the back burner or changes might be rushed through to help burnish the reputations of President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao on their way out. There has been growing speculation in China over whether the government will relax the one-child policy - introduced in 1980 as a temporary measure to curb surging population growth - and allow more people to have two children. Though the government credits the policy with preventing hundreds of millions of births and helping lift countless families out of poverty, it is reviled by many ordinary people. The strict limits have led to forced abortions and sterilizations, even though such measures are illegal. Choice: Chinese women walk their babies in a park in Beijing. The one-child policy has led to a major gender imbalance as many families favour having boys rather than girls (file picture) Couples who flout the rules face hefty fines, seizure of their property and loss of their jobs. Many demographers argue that the policy has worsened the country's aging crisis by limiting the size of the young labor pool that must support the large baby boom generation as it retires. They say it has contributed to the imbalanced sex ratio by encouraging families to abort baby girls, preferring to try for a male heir. The government recognizes those problems and has tried to address them by boosting social services for the elderly. It has also banned sex-selective abortion and rewarded rural families whose only child is a girl. Many today also see the birth limits as outdated, a relic of the era when housing, jobs and food were provided by the state. 'It has been thirty years since our planned economy was liberalised,' commented Wang Yi, the owner of a shop that sells textiles online, under a news report on the foundation's proposal. 'So why do we still have to plan our population?' Rescued: An abducted child is shown with a crude marking on the back of his neck in Guiyang, southwestern China. The one child policy has fuelled the market for baby smuggling, as parents sell off unwanted children . Though open debate about the policy has flourished in state media and on the Internet, leaders have so far expressed a desire to maintain the status quo. President Hu said last year that China would keep its strict family planning policy to keep the birth rate low and other officials have said that no changes are expected until at least 2015. Gu Baochang, a professor of demography at Beijing's Renmin University and a vocal advocate of reform, said the proposed timeline wasn't aggressive enough. 'They should have reformed this policy ages ago,' he said. 'It just keeps getting held up, delayed.'","Unpopular birth restrictions introduced in 1980 when population was rapidly expanding .

Double-edged sword: Stress sets off eczema, so it is doubly cruel that Bronagh works in an industry that demands perfect looks . Stripping off for an intimate scene in a TV show that will be watched by millions would be nerve-racking for any actress. But for Bronagh Waugh, star of the recent BBC drama The Fall, showing some skin was nothing less than 'mortifying' - because she suffers from severe eczema all over her body. 'It was a nightmare because I felt so self-conscious, and we were outside, so my hay fever was set off, too,' says Bronagh. 'But we just laughed about it and I'm so pleased I did it now.' Thanks to expert make-up both on and off screen, you'd never guess that Bronagh suffers with eczema, a condition causing patches of itchy, red, dry and cracked skin. But the 30-year-old actress, best known for starring in soap opera Hollyoaks, has had it all her life. 'When I was born I came out covered in eczema,' she says. 'My mum and dad had it, but theirs was less serious. 'My earliest memories are of having long baths in emollient and wearing mittens all the time to stop me scratching. The itchiness drove me crazy. I still scratch myself in my sleep, sometimes so much that it bleeds.' Throughout her teens, Bronagh was highly self-conscious about her eczema, and despite laughing about it good-naturedly at school, she would weep to her mother at night. So she sometimes finds it hard to believe she grew up to be an actress, confident enough to bare all for the cameras. One in five children and one in 12 adults lives with eczema, a condition triggered by inflammation, says Dr Tabi Leslie, a leading dermatologist and spokesperson for the British Skin Foundation. 'There are various forms, but the most common is atopic eczema, which is inherited through genes that carry eczema, hay fever and asthma. So it may be that one or both parents have one of these conditions but they produce a child with eczema.' The condition is caused when the immune system over-reacts to harmless allergens, setting up a process of inflammation which causes the distinctive red, itchy patches of skin, often on the insides of elbows and knees. Experts agree that eczema is probably caused by a combination of an inherited predisposition and environmental triggers. Worryingly, the number of cases in the UK has increased dramatically. 'Eczema has become hugely prevalent - there's been about a threefold rise in the past 40 years,' says Margaret Cox, chief executive of the National Eczema Society. 'Genes don't change that fast so we suspect the culprit is modern living - we wash a lot more than we used to and use more products, and we central heat our homes and air condition our buildings. Soap and temperature variations seem to be common triggers.' Indeed, when Bronagh's family moved to Thailand when she was 11, after her mother got a job there, her eczema all but disappeared as she wasn't living in such a changeable climate. But it returned when she came back to the UK at 16. Worrying: The number of cases of eczema in the UK has increased dramatically . 'Unfortunately, it was around then I really started getting into acting and dancing and I felt so self-conscious wearing leotards. 'I remember being in a play where there was lots of holding hands, and no one wanted to touch me. The boys would say they didn't want to lift me. I felt like an ogre. I was so embarrassed.' Stigma is a huge issue for eczema sufferers, says Margaret Cox, who has the condition herself. 'We hear of people going to the shops and people refusing to serve them.' Bronagh knew she was entering an industry where looks mean everything - and cruelly, stress can exacerbate eczema, so she often suffered flare-ups just before acting jobs and auditions. 'I remember going to see a GP when I was 21. I'd had a terrible break-out and had a big audition coming up. She said: “I think you should think about changing your job.” 'I was so upset as I wasn't getting much acting work at the time. It was definitely my lowest point and I did think: “What am I doing?” But luckily my mum was great and told me not to listen to her.' The turning point came in 2008 when, at the age of 25, Bronagh was offered the part of Cheryl Brady in Channel 4's Hollyoaks. 'That helped massively,' she says. Bronagh sat down with the head of make-up and explained her condition, including the products and ingredients she used and avoided. 'I've used emollients and steroid creams all my life; they do help, but I try to use the steroids sparingly because they have the side-effect of thinning your skin. My hands already look older than my years.' All eczema sufferers are advised to minimise the amount of product they put on their skin - besides their treatments. But Bronagh has to be especially careful because, like a third of people with eczema, she also has food allergies, including an allergy to nuts. Food allergies are disproportionately high among eczema sufferers because the conditions share the mechanism of an exaggerated immune response, says dermatologist Dr Leslie. 'The new thinking is if eczema occurs before a baby is six months old they are likely to have a food allergy, whereas if it starts later the risk goes down.' Bronagh not only has to watch what she eats, she also has to check the labels of every product she puts on her skin. 'Only two years ago I was recommended a face cream, which was supposed to be good for eczema. I put it all over my face and my skin felt like it was on fire. That's nuts: Bronagh, like a third of people with eczema, has a food allergy - to nuts . 'I couldn't breathe and my lips swelled up like sausages - my top lip was touching my nose and my bottom lip was touching my chin. My boyfriend Googled the face cream straight away and found that it contained peanut oil.' Bronagh had gone into anaphylactic shock, a severe and potentially fatal allergic reaction where the release of histamine can cause dangerous swelling in the airways. Her boyfriend took her straight to A&E where  she was treated with antihistamine and adrenaline. Thankfully, with the experts at Hollyoaks, Bronagh has developed a regimen both to treat her eczema and, where needed, conceal it. She says: 'The problem is, so much of what's out there for eczema is medical, but the fact is young people, and especially girls, want a cover-up, too. Doctors tell you just to let the skin breathe, but when you're 15 and going to school it's not that simple.' Bronagh feels confident enough to talk publicly about her eczema for the first time. 'Lots of actors and models have it, but no one wants to talk about it because they feel they need to keep up this perfect ideal. 'I want to get rid of the stigma because I remember what it was like to be a teenager with eczema. 'People think it's contagious and it's gross. The more people understand what eczema is, the less of a big deal it is.' After years of trial and error, Bronagh has got living with eczema down to a fine art. Here are her tips: .

Having threatened to bomb the United States and warned foreigners to leave South Korea due to an impending thermonuclear war, North Korea returned to domestic matters today by holding its annual marathon in Pyongyang. The North’s state news agency said a big contingent of foreign runners were expected from countries including Ukraine, the Czech Republic, Zimbabwe, Kenya and Ethiopia as well as 600 North Koreans at today's race. The marathon celebrates tomorrow's 101st anniversary of the birthday of the country’s founder Kim Il Sung, grandfather of the current leader Kim Jong Un. Scroll down for video . The marathon, in its 26th year, marks tomorrow's anniversary of Kim Il Sung's birthday . Marathon runners pass by a long row of North Korean soldiers as they cross a bridge in Pyongyang today in the 26th Mangyongdae Prize Marathon . 'I think enthusiasm for the upcoming tournament is running high among local marathoners and their coaches as never before,' Ham Chang-hyok of the Sports Ministry told the KCNA state agency this week. This is the 26th time the Mangyongdae Prize International Marathon, named after a hill revered for its association with the country’s founding hero, Kim Il Sung, has been held. It is not known if North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, whose portly frame would appear to suggest he is not a keen runner, would attend the event. Kim is noted for his love of basketball and recently hosted former Chicago Bulls star Dennis Rodman in the capital, Pyongyang. The anniversary of the birth of Kim Il Sung, the grandfather of the current leader, is also usually marked which a big military parade. The United States and Japan have offered new talks with North Korea to resolve the increasingly dangerous stand-off over its nuclear and missile programmes, but said the reclusive communist government first must lower tensions and honour previous agreements. North Korea has a clear course of action available to it, and will find 'ready partners' in the United States if it follows through, Secretary of State John Kerry told reporters. Runners from around the world were expected in Pyongyang today to take part in the memorial marathon, celebrating the 101st anniversary of the birth of Kim Il Sung . Runners rested while military staff stood guard at the stadium . Japan's foreign minister Fumio Kishida, who appeared with Mr Kerry at a news conference, was more explicit, saying that North Korea must honour its commitment to earlier deals regarding its nuclear and missile programmes and on returning kidnapped foreigners. The officials agreed on the need to work toward a nuclear-free North Korea and opened the door to direct talks if certain conditions are met. Their comments highlight the difficulty in resolving the North Korean nuclear situation in a peaceful manner, as pledged by Mr Kerry and Chinese leaders in Beijing yesterday. Gaining China's commitment, Mr Kerry insisted, was no small matter given Beijing's historically strong military and economic ties to North Korea. Cars with timing clocks and standing spectators waited for the start of the marathon at the Kim Il Sung Stadium in Pyongyang today . The race went ahead despite international tensions between North Korea and the South . The issue has taken on fresh urgency in recent months, given North Korea's tests of a nuclear device and intercontinental ballistic missile technology, and its increasingly brazen threats of nuclear strikes against the United States. US and South Korean officials believe the North may deliver another provocation in the coming days with a mid-range missile test. Mr Kerry said the US would defend both its allies at all cost. His visit to Japan followed two days of meetings in South Korea and China.","The 26th Mangyongdae Prize race marks the birthday of Kim Il Sung .

Change: Residents will have to be consulted over applications for small wind farms in their area under new rules - set to come in to force next month . Residents will have to be consulted over applications for wind farms in their area, under new laws set to come into force next month. Currently only developers of a handful of the biggest wind farms have to discuss the implications of their projects with local people. But new rules from the department of Communities Secretary Eric Pickles will mean even small developments of two or more turbines which are at least 50ft high will have to go through a similar process. Officials said smaller developments can have a major impact on local areas and be widely opposed - but often the first time residents are aware of them is when an application is received by the council. Under the new system, a consultation will have to be publicised before an application is made - either by email or letter or in a public meeting. It will not guarantee more applications are rejected but will mean local residents get a greater say over the size and location from the start, when they have more opportunity to influence the process. Mr Pickles, the communities secretary said: ‘We are making sure local people have a crystal clear voice in airing their opinions on wind turbines very early on. From day one communities should be centre stage in crafting plans that affect their lives instead of having them forced upon them. ‘Ensuring communities have a greater say at an early stage allows developers to consider much earlier whether to pursue a proposal and what changes they should consider before putting forward formal plans. Our changes allow people’s views and other impacts to be taken into consideration much earlier.’ There are already 4,000 onshore wind turbines in Britain and it is estimated 10,000 will be needed by the end of the decade to meet targets to cut carbon emissions. But applications by developers, who stand to rake in tens of thousands of pounds in subsidies have angered local communities who think they blight the landscape and hit house prices. Council planners already reject around half the applications they receive, but many are then approved on appeal by planning inspectors to champion green energy. Standing up: Eric Pickles, Communities Secretary, said earlier this year the drive to build wind farms would no longer trump protecting the landscape . Mr Pickles announced this year that the drive to build wind farms would no longer automatically trump protecting the landscape. In a major boost for anti-wind farm campaigners, their concerns about the visual and environmental impact must be taken into account, and that for six months his Whitehall department would centrally review some of the appeals to make sure residents get a say. Wind farms are a running sore between the Liberal Democrats and the Tories. Over a hundred Conservative backbenchers, as well as some cabinet ministers, are opposed to onshore wind farms, which they say ruin the countryside and do not help mitigate climate change. Tory energy minister Michael Fallon said: ‘These new rules will help ensure that in future people have a say earlier on in the process over where onshore turbines are sited. Wind is an important part of the UK’s energy mix, and both Government and industry agree that these proposals will ensure that new turbines are appropriately sited.’","Currently only developers of the biggest wind farms have to discuss the implications of their projects with local people .

"By . Martin Daubney . PUBLISHED: . 17:04 EST, 16 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:04 EST, 16 November 2013 . Like most men who have turned 40 – and many who are much younger – I endlessly and pointlessly worry about my health. A hangover can easily become terminal hepatitis C after a few misguided clicks on Net Doctor. Recently my partner Diana – fed up with my constant worrying –  told me she was getting one of those all-singing, all-dancing private health MOTs via her work’s healthcare plan, and ordered me to do the same. I was intrigued, as any middle-aged hypochondriac would be. Had my misspent youth left irreparable damage? Clean Bill: Martin Daubney has his fitness tested at the gym as part of a health MOT courtesy of his GP . But with no health insurance of my own, the day of tests would cost me a hefty £650. Surely, there are other options? After . a little research I discovered I could get almost everything offered by . the private MOT companies for free or next to nothing with an NHS . Health Check at the GP and a fitness test at my gym. Dr Jonty Heaversedge, a GP in South London, says: ‘We offer a series of basic tests to assess the risks of heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and kidney disease.’ The service, he explains, is available to adults aged between 40 and 74. There are not as many tests as in the more complex private screening; an ECG for example. Dr Heaversedge adds: ‘The NHS  is more discerning. If there is a need for further testing – whether through family history or lifestyle – then it can be done.’ And so I submitted myself. The good news: I’d save a lot of money. The bad news: I might find out I’m really dying. CHOLESTEROL TEST . I have a pin-prick blood test where a tiny sample taken from a finger is put on a cartridge, then inserted  into a machine. In a few seconds a number pops up on the digital display. ‘High cholesterol can contribute to blocked arteries,’ says Dr Heaversedge. These are associated with heart attack and stroke. The NHS recommends total cholesterol should be scored lower than five. Result: Action required . My cholesterol test gives me a slightly raised level of 5.53. I’m confused as Diana is vegetarian and  I’m hardly overweight at 6ft 3in with a size 34 waist. But we eat far too much cheese and lashings of butter. It’s no disaster – I’ve no family history of heart problems. I’m advised to cut down on dairy and sugar and come back in a month. MOT: The NHS Health check, available to adults between 40 and 74, tests everything from cholesterol to kidney health . KIDNEY HEALTH . Next, a urine test: I’m given a little screw-top jar, pop to the loo, return, and the nurse dips in a stick which changes colour as the chemicals react with protein in the sample. ‘High protein in the urine can be associated with kidney disease,’ says Dr Heaversedge. This problem is increasingly prevalent, due to high blood sugar and blood pressure. Early treatment is essential. Result: No action required . I hand over a sample which looks suspiciously cloudy – only to find the testing strip turns yellow, I’m ‘completely normal’. Blue would have been bad news. BLOOD PRESSURE . The test for blood pressure is familiar – an inflatable cuff is strapped round my upper arm and inflated until it’s tight, then air is slowly let out. High blood pressure increases the risk of serious vascular health problems such as heart attack, stroke and kidney disease. It often has no symptoms. Result: No action required . There are two numbers: systolic, the highest level your blood pressure reaches when your heart beats; and diastolic, the lowest level your blood pressure reaches as your heart relaxes between beats. It should be between 90/60 and 140/90 and at 107/60, I am ‘excellent’. This feels like a walk in the park. Result: Martin's GP check-up came back mostly positive, putting an end to months of concern about his health . BODY MASS INDEX (BMI) Your BMI is an indicator of how healthy your weight is. A higher reading will indicate obesity, which raises risks of everything from diabetes to cancers. It is calculated by dividing your weight in kilograms by your height in metres squared. Result: Action may be required . At 91kg and with a BMI of 25.2, I’m just overweight. This comes as a shock as I rarely eat breakfast, busily attending to the needs of my three-year-old, Sonny. ‘Breakfast is one of the most important meals  of the day,’ says my GP. ‘Without it, your body goes into lockdown and actually stores energy as fat.’ WAIST MEASUREMENT . ‘This indicates diabetes risk more than BMI alone,’ says Dr Heaversedge. ‘Measure around your belly button, not where your trousers  sit, and don’t suck in.’ Men should measure less than 37in and women 31.5in. Result: No action required . At 34in, I’m bang in the middle of the safe area. Since the test, I’ve lost 2kg, putting my BMI back in the healthy bracket, through cutting down on dairy products, eating breakfast, light cycling, gym trips and generally thinking about what I eat. Overall improvement: Martin urges other men over 40 to get a health MOT from their doctor, insisting it has improved his sex life and made him happier . OVERALL CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE RISK SCORE . ‘We don’t take just one risk factor for cardiovascular disease,’ says Dr Heaversedge. ‘We combine different elements, such as age, sex, blood pressure, smoking and cholesterol. Result: Good – but action required . I have less than a ten per cent chance of developing heart disease over the next ten years. But I smoke – a couple a day. ‘Your result is good but would be even better if you gave up smoking,’ says Dr Heaversedge. CONCLUSION . Like many men, I’ve been sitting around worrying about my health but not doing anything about it for too long. I’m sleeping better, feel happier and my sex life has improved. There are other things I could have had, such as diabetes screening and a liver function test, but I am assured that due to my history and lack of health problems, it was unnecessary. Older men can have prostate cancer screening, and after 60 we all get a bowel cancer screening test. For free! And we all love a bargain, so why not do it? ‘For the most part our bodies are incredibly resilient,’ says Dr Heaversedge. ‘By checking our health, we generally don’t discover we’re going to die imminently, but we can make changes for the better to improve our health and the chance of living a better life for longer.’ For my part, I would urge other men to get checked out. If I can do it, anybody can.","Martin Daubney underwent free NHS MOT after worrying about his health .

A 16-year-old Northern California boy is being charged as an adult with hate crimes after authorities say he set on fire another teenager wearing a skirt aboard a bus because of homophobia. Alameda County prosecutors charged Richard Thomas, of Oakland, with felony assault and aggravated mayhem with hate crime enhancements in Monday's attack on Luke ‘Sasha’ Fleischman, who is hospitalized with second- and third-degree burns. ‘Richard Thomas' violent and senseless criminal conduct resulted in severe and traumatic injuries to a young and entirely innocent victim,’ District Attorney Nancy O'Malley said after charges were filed. ‘The intentional and callous nature of the crime is shocking and will not be tolerated in our community.’ Thomas didn't enter a plea during his arraignment Thursday. He was being held without bail and is due back in court November 12. Thomas' mother, who identified herself only as Ms. Jackson, spoke to KGO-TV outside the courtroom. ‘I am very sorry for my son's actions. I did not raise him that way,’ she said, adding: ‘My son is not a hateful person. He's a kid, kids joke around.’ Thomas' mother added that her son regretted his actions and will write the victim a letter of apology. The junior at Oakland High School was arrested at school Tuesday afternoon after surveillance video from a public bus helped police identify him as the suspected attacker. Scroll down for video . Reckoning: Richard Thomas, 16, has been arrested and charged as adult with assault and aggravated mayhem with hate crime enhancements in attack on Fleischman .

Kids being kids: Thomas' relatives, pictured . here in the courtroom, said that Richard is not a hateful person, that . the incident was a 'joke,' and that he is sorry for his actions . Authorities say Thomas used a lighter . to set Fleischman's kilt-like skirt on fire while Fleischman was asleep . on an AC Transit bus in Oakland at around 5pm, authorities said. Other passengers came to the 18-year-old's aid after he tried to put out the flames himself.

A 21-year-old man critically wounded his college honors student ex-girlfriend and killed her new boyfriend, then turned a gun on himself in a murder-suicide that has shocked the small-town campus of Salisbury University in Maryland. Police say Ryan Shallue became increasingly disturbed after his high school girlfriend Kristen Loetz, 19, dumped him four months ago. She had just started her sophomore year of college. Shallue began stalking her and bought a gun two weeks ago. On Wednesday night, he showed up at Loetz's off-campus house, where she discovered her with 20-year-old Charles 'CJ' Abbott. When Shallue began fighting with Loetz, Abbott tried to intervene, police said. High school sweethearts: Police say Ryan Shallue, 21, left, attacked his ex-girlfriend Kristen Loetz, 19, four months after she dumped him. Loetz was critically wounded. Shallue killed himself . 'Thanks for being my hero': Loetz wrote an emotional thanks to CJ Abbott, the 20-year-old who sacrificed himself to help save her life when ex Ryan Shallue pulled out a gun to exact his revenge . Police say Shallue forced his way into his ex-girlfriend's house, just off the campus of Salisbury University on Tuesday night . Shallue pulled out a semi-automatic pistol and shot Loetz in the face and killed Abbott. He then went into the bathroom and shot himself in the head. Abbott's sister said he died a hero, trying to stop Shallue from assaulting Loetz. Loetz was taken to a Baltimore hospital, where she was listed in critical condition.

The mother of a 15-month-old boy who died on a court-ordered visit to his father filed a wrongful-death lawsuit on Tuesday against the psychologist who sanctioned the visitation. Hera McLeod of Gaithersburg, Md., filed the $20 million suit in Fairfax County against Ashburn Psychological Services and psychologist Margaret Wong, alleging professional negligence resulting in the wrongful death of her son, Prince McLeod Rams. McLeod said at a news conference announcing the suit that Wong's report was instrumental in a judge's decision to grant unsupervised visitation of Prince to his father, Joaquin Rams. Prince McLeod Rams died during unsupervised time with his father last October, now his mom is suing the psychologist who sanctioned the visitation . Father: Joaquin Rams (left) was charged with murder by prosecutors in Prince William County after drowning Prince McLeod Rams (right with mother Hera McLeod) Prince died in October, on the fourth unsupervised visit, and last month, Joaquin Rams was charged with murder by prosecutors in Prince William County. Authorities say he drowned the boy and had taken out life insurance policies on his son totaling more than $500,000. Authorities say that Prince's drowning has prompted a closer look at two other deaths of people close to Rams: the still-unsolved shooting of his ex-girlfriend Shawn K. Mason in 2003 and the 2008 death of Joaquin Rams' mother, which was classified a suicide. McLeod objected to turning her son over for unsupervised visitation on concerns that he would be in danger. She says the psychologist ignored clear warning signs that the father was dangerous, including testimony at the custody hearings that Manassas police considered Rams a suspect in Mason's death. McLeod, a former contestant on the CBS reality show 'The Amazing Race,' has been vocal in efforts to hold accountable those who she believes failed to protect her son when they had the opportunity, including the judge who granted the visitation. She writes a blog, Cappuccino Queen, that documents her case and her son's short life. Prince died last year and his father had taken out an insurance policy on him totaling more than $500,000 . Hera McLeod has said the psychologist's report was instrumental in a judge's decision to grant unsupervised visitation of son Prince to his father Joaquin Rams . Rams, before he was arrested, responded with a blog of his own, King Latte, in which he leveled his own accusations against McLeod. McLeod's lawsuit also alleges that Wong ignored a previous psychological examination of Rams that included allegations that he was physically abusive, had pulled a gun on a former girlfriend and had engaged in sexually aberrant behavior. 'I believe this doctor's negligence led to my son's murder,' McLeod said, saying it was hard more her to imagine a person more seriously 'disordered' than her former fiance. McLeod acknowledged Rams had a gift for deceiving people, including herself, at least for the first few months of their relationship. But she said that does not excuse Wong from missing obvious signs that Prince would be in danger if Rams were given unsupervised visits. Hera McLeod was a contestant on CBS show The Amazing Race in 2004 . 'The difference is, I'm not a psychologist,' McLeod said. The psychology practice declined comment Tuesday. The judge in Montgomery County, Md., who heard the custody dispute ordered Rams to get a mental evaluation, but allowed Rams to pick the psychologist. Rams was also the one who paid for the evaluation. McLeod's attorney, Patrick Regan, said Wong had a duty to prepare a report that would serve the best interests of the child, rather than merely benefiting the person who paid for the evaluation. Regan said there is a direct link between the faulty psychological report and the judge's decision to grant unsupervised visitation, which resulted in Prince's death. 'If it had been a supervised visitation, it never would have happened,' Regan said. Rams is now in custody pending a formal indictment for Prince's killing.","Prince McLeod Rams died during an unsupervised visit to his father Joaquin Rams .

The grandmother of a 10-year-old girl who was found stuffed into a garbage can had an emotional breakdown at the funeral. Robin Moss, the grandmother of Emani Moss, was seen crying as she left the church where Emani's funeral was held in Lawrenceville, Georgia on Wednesday. Emani's father, Eman Moss, and step-mother, Tiffany Moss, have been arrested and charged with murder, concealing a body, and child cruelty after police say they had starved to death their daughter and then set her body on fire to cover up the crime. The District Attorney announced that he may seek the death penalty for the parents after a detective testified at their probable cause hearing that the 10-year-old girl was starved to death and burned in a trash can.

Eman Moss eventually admitted that he returned home from work October 24 to find little Emani lying in the bathtub and unable to move. Neither he nor Tiffany Moss, however, sought medical attention for the girl because they were afraid they would get in trouble with the law, Flynn said. 'My baby went through hell,' her paternal grandmother Robin Moss told The Atlanta Journal Constitution earlier in the investigation. According to the woman, after Emani had confided in her that she was being abused by her parents- her son and his wife- but they kept the 10-year-old away from her. 'I'm guilty, I killed my baby,' Eman Moss told police, according to the detective’s testimony cited by the Atlanta Journal Constitution. According . to a report from Georgia’s child services agency, Eman Moss bought a . trash can and tried to incinerate his daughter's body in it. When the . girl's remains would not burn, he took Emani back home and called police . on November 2. It has . emerged earlier this week that Georgia's child protection agency had . dismissed a report that Emani Moss had been beaten with a belt. The . Division of Family and Children Services did not send caseworkers to . interview the girl, examine her injuries or question her parents. Stone-faced: Tiffany Moss (left) and Eman Moss (right) appeared impassive during their probable cause hearing Friday . Confession: Gwinnett County Police Detective Collin Flynn testified that Mr Moss had admitted to killing his child . Agency officials concluded the beatings were corporal punishment and ended the case despite four prior maltreatment investigations involving the child. The agency first made contact with the Moss family in 2003 when Emani was only one year old, the station 11Alive reported. Caseworkers were told that the baby was not being properly cared for and denied food, but the officials ruled the allegations 'unsubstantiated' and closed the matter. Two years later, in April 2005, the agency investigated claims that the 3-year-old girl was suffering emotional and psychological neglect, but these allegations were also dismissed as ‘unsubstantiated.' In December 2008, the DFCS got a tip asking to look into claims of inadequate medical care and possible sexual abuse. Caseworks met with the child in private and concluded that 'no concerns were noted' about her. In . March 2010, the child services agency confirmed that Emani had been . whipped with a belt for failing to finish her schoolwork or get good . grades. Emani's parents . were ordered to take parenting classes and go through an anger . management course. Three months later, the child was returned to the . home and the case was closed six months after that. Web of lies: Police said Eman Moss initially said that Emani died from ingesting chemicals, but later falsely accused his wife of poisoning her . History of abuse: Tiffany Moss allegedly whipped Emani with a belt for failing to do her homework or get good grades . Isolated: Police say her parents kept little Emani away from people outside of the immediate family and did not let her attend school . Last May, officials at Emani's grade school reported seeing welts on her back and marks on her head, which were determined to be the results of corporal punishment. The last contact between DFCS and the Moss family came three months before Emani's death, when the agency got an anonymous tip that Emani appeared 'distant and afraid to interact’ with others. However, DFCS closed the case after failing to find the parents’ address. Police reports released since last Saturday indicate that the 10-year-old tried to run away from home and showed up at school with bruises and welts. ‘Detectives believe the victim was isolated from people outside of her family in the weeks before her death,’ said Gwinnett police spokesman Cpl. Jake Smith. ‘She did not attend school outside the home during this school year.’ Robin Moss’ attorney said the woman tried to get child services to open an investigation into allegations of abuse, but no action had been taken. Inconsolable: Robin Moss, Emani's paternal grandmother, said she had fought to win custody of the 10-year-old and asked child services officials to investigate possible abuse, but no action was taken . Miss Moss also said she had fought to win custody of her granddaughter, but the state would not let her have Emani. ‘I don't understand how the system kept putting her back in that home,’ Moss said. The bereaved grandmother explained that she helped raise Emani from the time she was 4 years old, and the two had developed a strong bond. In an interview with WSBTV, Robin Moss said that since her granddaughter’s death, she cannot sleep because she can 'see her hurt.' Division of Family and Children Services officials released a statement Tuesday announcing that it will look into the way the agency handled Emani’s case. Special bond: Robin Moss said she helped raise Emani from the time she was 4 years old, and the two had a relationship akin to that of a mother and daughter . Horrific: Police found the body inside this trash can and said that there was evidence that it had been burned . Authorities conducted an autopsy on . Emani Sunday and determined that her body was burned after she was . dead, likely in an effort to conceal the crime, said Gwinnett County . Police Cpl. Jake Smith. Emani . may have died as early as October 30 and was severely underweight when . her body was found, Smith said. He said the autopsy showed the girl had . been denied food for several days before her death. Both Eman Moss and his second wife have criminal histories. The father was arrested in 2004 on charges of battery and cruelty to children after police said he allegedly beat his first wife in front of Emani. Tiffany . Moss told police she only hit the girl with a belt three times, the . report said. She was arrested on a child-cruelty charge. The . Georgia Division of Family and Children Services signed a 2010 plea . deal ordering Tiffany Moss to serve five years of probation for beating . Emani, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Monday. In July 2012, Emani tried running away from home, the police reports show. Emani's . mother, Danita Leaks, told Atlanta FOX affiliate WAGA-TV on Monday that . she and Eman Moss fought over custody for two to three years and she . was unaware that her daughter was being abused. ‘If .

Home grown: Fern Britton will present Grow, Make, Eat: The Great Allotment Challenge, a new six-part series which aims to repeat the success of The Great British Bake Off . The Great British Bake Off inspired thousands of viewers to dust off their oven mitts. And now the BBC is hoping a new gardening show – called Grow, Make, Eat: The Great Allotment Challenge – will do for cabbages and cucumbers what Bake Off did for pies and pastries. Presented by Fern Britton, the six-part series is expected to air on BBC Two in early 2014. The programme will see nine  pairs of passionate gardeners putting their green fingers to the test as they attempt to harvest  a crop of vegetables and fruits, ready to be judged by a panel of experts. Over the course of four months the contestants will meticulously plan, plant and nurture their allotments inside a beautiful walled garden on the Mapledurham estate in Oxfordshire. They will then be put through their paces in a series of challenges – including flower-arranging and making jam – under the watchful eyes of the judges. Each week the participants will be given scores based on how they perform in three trials which will be designed to test their horticultural knowledge, creativity and culinary skills. And every episode will reflect the growing season, explaining to viewers what crops are ripe for picking at that particular time. Royal Horticultural Society judge Jim Buttress, tipped to be the Paul Hollywood of the series, will be joined on the panel by floral designer Jonathan Moseley and cookery writer Thane Prince. Building on the tradition of the annual horticultural show, with its competitions for jams, chutneys, fruits, vegetables and flowers, the programme is set to celebrate Britain’s love for gardening – and, of course, a good competition. Inspiration: Gardening experts are hoping that the series will inspire would-be gardeners to take to grown their own fruit and vegetables . Expertise: The contestants will be judged by a panel including preserves expert Thane Prince, left, and floral designer Jonathan Moseley, right . Experts are hoping that the series . will inspire would-be gardeners to take to the great outdoors and grow . their own vegetables – just like characters Tom and Barbara in The Good . Life, who laughed their way through the ups and downs of their . self-sufficient lifestyle. Matthew . Appleby, author of the Allotment Planner, said: ‘It’s a big hope for . everybody in the industry that this is going to make a garden boom time . again in the same way Alan Titchmarsh’s show Ground Force did some years . ago. ‘The BBC has spent . lots of money setting this up. But the difficulty with the concept is . that while you can bake something in an hour or two, with gardening it . takes weeks to grow anything.’ Over . the last few years, there has been a move towards grow-your-own food – . with many council-owned allotments reporting lengthy waiting lists. And . some city-dwellers have been making the most of limited space, with . balconies and windowsills doubling as gardens. The . BBC’s head of documentaries Emma Willis said: ‘We’re really excited . about this fantastic new series which will tap into the wave of public . interest in growing your own and crafts from chutney-making to floral . arrangements. ‘With the . cost of living continuing to rise, it’s the perfect time to make the . most of our gardens and allotments and get growing.’ Popular: There has been a boom in the popularity of growing fruit and vegetables, with long waiting lists at many allotments .

Success story: After The Great British Bake Off inspired thousands of viewers to dust off their oven mitts, the BBC is hoping to do the same for gardening gloves with its latest show . Cherry tomatoes are ideal to grow in window boxes . A lack of outdoor space need not deter a would-be gardener, with many varieties of plants suitable for even the smallest space. Dwarf varieties of broad beans, which grow no more than 60cm are suitable for window boxes. The beans, pods and shoot tips can be harvested and then either eaten raw or cooked. Chilli plants can be grown from seed indoors as long as they have a sunny spot to grown in. They like a moisture-retentive soil and gardeners can use tomato feed to encourage the plants to fruit. Kale can be grown in a window box, although dwarf varieties are more suitable for smaller spaces. Cress makes a useful addition to salads and is very quick to grow, making it suitable for children to plant.Young gardeners can sow the seeds on a piece of cotton wool inside an eggshell - drawing a face on the shell so the leaves become the 'hair'. Cherry tomatoes are ideal for windowboxes. Plant trailing varieties in a moisture-retentive soil and feed and water regularly.","Grow, Make, Eat: The Great Allotment Challenge to air in 2014 on BBC Two .

The embattled mayor of Toronto has admitted to getting 'professional help' for his emotional problems, but still insists he isn't an addict and doesn't need drug treatment. Rob Ford made a very public appearance today at a Canadian Football League playoff game to cheer on the Toronto Argonauts - despite the CFL commissioner's pleas that he stay away from the game. The Toronto city council voted Friday to strip the mayor of some of his powers. That effort will continue Monday when the council moves to deny Ford most of his remaining powers, including his office budget. It would also appoint the deputy mayor to lead his executive committee. Party animal: Toronto Mayor Rob Ford, an avid Toronto Argonauts fan, hold up a makeshift replica of the Grey Cup while attending a playoffs game Sunday . Ford poses with a fellow Canadian Football League fan after making an appearance at the Rogers Centre - despite being warned off by the CFL commissioner . Ford went on Fox News to again apologize for smoking crack cocaine and having 'outbursts.' 'I have admitted to using illegal drugs in the last year, OK? I’ve admitted to drinking too much, OK? so I’m dealing with it. I am training every day. I’m in the gym for two hours every day. I’m seeking professional help,' he said. 'I’m not an alcoholic. I’m not a drug addict.' Ford has remained defiant despite an increasingly-embarrassing list of public statements and admissions about bad behavior. Most recently, he made crude comments about his sex life with his wife - while she was standing with him. He was attempting to dismiss allegations that he had propositioned a female staffer for oral sex. He was wearing a jersey for his beloved Toronto Argonauts at the time - a custom shirt that reads 'Major Ford' on the back. Taunted: A woman holds a sign mocking the rival team's city mayor Rob Ford who was in the crowd watching the CFL eastern final football game between the Toronto Argonauts and the Hamilton Tiger Cats in Toronto . Spectacle: Rob Ford's appearance Sunday was greeted with significant attention - and some amount of bemusement by football fans . That prompted Argonauts CEO Chris Rudge to call Ford's ongoing calamities 'an unfortunate situation for the city.' CFL Commissioner Mark Cohon asked that Ford to stay away from Sunday's Eastern . Conference final between the Toronto Argonauts and Hamilton Tiger-Cats. He ignored the calls and Sunday afternoon, shortly after halftime, he took a seat a seat about 20 rows back from the field. His arrival caused a stir in Section 129 of the Rogers Centre, with fans clogging the aisle as they snapped photos and exchanged handshakes with the mayor who recently has acknowledged smoking crack cocaine and drinking excessively. Mocking: A Hamilton Tiger Cats fan holds a cut out poster of Toronto Mayor Rob Ford's head during the CFL eastern final football game between the Toronto Argonauts and the Hamilton Tiger Cats in Toronto . Wearing a dark blue Argonauts jersey with 'Mayor Ford' and the number 12 across the back, Ford laughed and drew cheers as he held aloft a crudely constructed replica of the Grey Cup, Canadian football's championship trophy. Outside the downtown stadium before kickoff, fans of both teams said Ford should stay away from the game. 'He needs to take some time off and get help,' said Bob Walker, dressed in an Argonauts baseball cap and jacket. The city council is seeking to strip the mayor of nearly all of his powers tomorrow. Today he celebrated at football . 'It's definitely a distraction... He means well, he's done well for the city. It's just, it's enough, you know? We need to get on with the city and take his business somewhere else for a bit.' Hamilton fan Shawn Kowalyshyn, wearing a Tiger-Cats jersey, said the mayor has 'embarrassed' himself and his family. 'Unfortunately, I'd like to support him and his policies, but he's just gone too far over the top. ... It's gotten too ridiculous,' Kowalyshyn said. Brothers Kyle and Matt O'Connor of Hamilton held up a hand-lettered sign reading 'Our Mayor Doesn't Smoke Crack!!' as they lined up to wait for stadium gates to open. Earlier Sunday, the 44-year-old Ford was spotted outside the downtown studios of the tabloid Sun News Network, where he and brother Doug, a Toronto city councilor, were taping the first episode of their new current events television show, 'Ford Nation,' which is to air Monday night. Working up a sweat: Toronto Mayor Rob Ford mops his brow as he watches the CFL eastern final football game between the Toronto Argonauts and the Hamilton Tiger Cats . Meet and greet: Toronto Mayor Rob Ford gets close to a fan of the opposition . Recently released court documents show Ford became the subject of a police investigation after news reports surfaced in May that he had been caught on video smoking crack cocaine. In interviews with police, former staffers accused the mayor of frequently drinking, driving while intoxicated and making sexual advances toward a female staffer. Ford's erratic behavior was parodied in the opening segment of the U.S. comedy show 'Saturday Night Live,' with cast member Bobby Moynihan portraying the mayor who at one point ducks behind the lectern at a press conference to do a drug deal, exclaiming, 'Wow, that's a lot of crack.' Ford finally decides he needs to go on a TV show which would believe him, and then is shown being interviewed by CBS '60 Minutes' correspondent Lara Logan (Kate McKinnon) who accepts his denials that he did crack, smoked marijuana and used alcohol. Logan recently had to apologize on-air for a '60 Minutes' story about the deadly 2012 attack on a U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya, saying the network could no longer trust the testimony of a former security contractor who had claimed he was present during the attack.","Mayor Rob Ford was asked to steer clear of today's Canadian Football League playoff game by the CFL commissioner .

Stamp of approval: The Royal Mail have decided to commemorate Anthony Trollope with a set of stamps ahead of the bicentenary of his birth in December following calls from The Mail on Sunday . A commemorative set of stamps will honour Anthony Trollope – the Victorian novelist who introduced the pillar box to Britain – after an intervention by The Mail on Sunday. The Royal Mail is to produce the stamps as part of celebrations to mark the bicentenary of the author’s birth in 2015. The decision comes just days after it said it had no ‘current’ plans to produce a stamp in response to a freedom of information request from this newspaper. Last night a Royal Mail spokesman said the organisation had decided to look again at the issue in the light of The Mail on Sunday’s original request and subsequent enquiries. Trollope is best known for his Palliser and Barchester series of novels – and his stories of political and  ecclesiastical intrigue have made  him essential bedtime reading for politicians, peers and members of  the clergy. His fans include Tory former Prime Minister Sir John Major, Downton Abbey creator Lord Fellowes, P D James and Ruth Rendell. Any failure by the Royal Mail to honour the writer – who was also a leading figure with the Victorian postal service – would have been a public relations disaster. Lord Fellowes said: ‘I am so glad to hear that the Post Office now intends to mark his double centenary. It would have been odd if they had not. ‘I can think of no other instance . where a world-famous, front-rank novelist has introduced a British icon . in an entirely different area of our national life.’ He . added: ‘The first pillar boxes were tried in Britain – after he had . seen them used in France – in 1852, at the urging of Anthony Trollope, . who was then a Post Office employee. ‘The red pillar box is still with us . and has long since moved into the company of other British icons,  like . the double-decker bus and Nelson’s Column.’ Novelist Anthony Trollope introduced the ubiquitous red pillar box, now a British icon, in 1852 while working for the Post Office . Trollope was 19 when he joined the Post Office as a clerk and he wrote as he rose through its ranks to surveyor. Michael Williamson, chairman of the Trollope Society, welcomed the U-turn and said: ‘The society feels very strongly the bicentenary  of his birth in 2015 would be an appropriate time to remedy this serious omission.’ A Royal Mail spokesman said: ‘Royal Mail receives hundreds of requests each year for subjects  of stamps. ‘Clearly, we can’t satisfy all of these. But we have given further consideration to Anthony Trollope, a notable British author, but also a former employee of ours.’","Royal Mail will commemorate novelist Anthony Trollope with a set of stamps to mark the bicentenary of his birth in December .

While the likes of Google, Amazon and Apple are trying to make tablets smaller and thinner, Panasonic has decided to buck this trend with a giant touchscreen device. The Toughpad is a 20-inch 4K tablet - almost three times the size of Google’s Nexus 7 - and runs Windows software. It also weighs over 5lbs, which is five times heavier than Apple’s new iPad Air, but is just half an inch thick. Panasonic unveiled its Toughpad tablet, pictured, earlier this year and has now announced the 20-inch device will go on sale in the U.S in January. UK prices and release dates haven't been confirmed.The tablet's screen is three times bigger than Google's Nexus 7, and it weighs five times more than Apple's iPad Air . Screen: 20"" Resolution: 3,840 x 2,560 . PPI: 230 . Processor: Intel i5 1.9GHz . Memory: 8GB RAM . Storage: 256GB . Battery life: Two hours . The huge size and screen also means the device comes with a two-hour battery life despite costing $5,999. Panasonic hasn’t designed the tablet for consumers, though. Instead it is aiming the device at hospitals, museums, architects and construction sites. It is called Toughpad because it has been made of reinforced glass fibre and has a magnesium alloy case. The 4K technology in the screen has been dubbed the next-generation in high-quality displays, and the Toughpad has a resolution of 3,840 x 2,560. This gives it a pixel-per-inch density of 230, putting it slightly above the quality of Apple’s 13-inch Macbook Pro. The tablet additionally has an Intel i51.9Ghz processor, 8GB of RAM and comes with 256GB of built-in storage -  the same amount offered on high-end Apple iPads and Google’s 12.85-inch Chromebook Pixel.

It is called Toughpad because it has been made of reinforced glass fibre and has a magnesium alloy case. The 4K technology in the screen has been dubbed the next-generation in high-quality displays . Bill Mannion, Microsoft’s director of Windows Consumer Marketing said: ‘This is as close as I’ve ever seen to real life on a display. It literally is like looking out of the window.' Panasonic is also offering an Electronic Touch Pen that works like a stylus, similar to Samsung’s S-Pen. It is said to give 2,000 levels of pressure by using infrared signals and Bluetooth to analyse and read the screen’s individual pixels, making it highly accurate and responsive. Panasonic is not the first company to launch a 20-inch device; HP recently launched a giant tablet called the HP Envy Rove 20. It is almost twice the weight of Panasonic's Toughpad, at 12.27lbs, and the screen resolution is 1,600 x 900, yet because of the lower-quality features and age it costs a much cheaper $979.

"By . Kerry Mcqueeney . UPDATED: . 23:30 EST, 1 December 2011 . A rusty pocket knife Lawrence of Arabia is thought to have used in his desert campaign during World War One is going up for sale. The Victorian-era knife was made by Royal cutlers Underwood and Farrant that produced them before the Swiss Army version became popular. And historians are wondering whether this . early multi-tooled blade proved invaluable to the war hero as he battled . the Turks in the deserts of Arabia. Cunning: The recent discovery of this knife could reveal the secret behind the success of the British hero . Hero: Thomas Edward Lawrence led the Arab Revolt against the Turks in the First World War . It was found in the garden of Clouds Hill, Lawrence's home near Bovington in Dorset, where the mysterious hero was living when he died after crashing his Brough Superior motorbike in 1935. The knife has the initials TEL - for Thomas Edward Lawrence - burned into the wooden handle, a technique Lawrence used on many of his possessions. The current owner bought the knife in the 1990s from the son of the local man who found it 40 years before. It is likely Lawrence dropped the knife where it lay in the undergrowth for decades. It is being sold along with the hero's 1916 military-issue pith helmet and his agal - the garment worn by Arabs around the head. Lawrence was famed for shunning military fatigues for ethnic costume during his heroics leading the Arab Revolt. The items are all being sold by the same owner who over the years has collected many items related to TE Lawrence. Mark of a hero: The knife has the initials TEL carved into the handle - which stand for Thomas Edward Lawrence . The anonymous seller said: 'The pith helmet and the agal came from the home of Pat and Joyce Knowles who live opposite Lawrence and looked after Cloud's Hill. 'The knife I bought from a man whose father had found it in the garden at Cloud's Hill in the 1950s. 'He didn't say anything about it at the time in case it belonged to Cloud's Hill but I later checked and it wasn't on the inventory. 'Lawrence possibly lost it in his garden and it is a late-Victorian piece so it is possible it could have been with him when he made his name in the First World War. 'The helmet and the agal were sold after Pat and Joyce passed away. Under the rim of the helmet it has the date 1916. 'That would fit in with Lawrence . first being sent to Cairo. And Pat knowles certainly identified it as . having belonged to Lawrence. 'The agal is the type of thing he wore and it is known he bought several back and gave them to people. ' Unearthed: The pocketknife was discovered in the garden of Clouds Hill (pictured), Lawrence's home near Bovington in Dorset . Discovery: The pocketknife was manufactured by the Queen's cutlers Underwood and Farrant in late Victorian London . Richard Bromell, from Charterhouse auctioneers in Sherborne, Dorset, which is selling the items, said: 'These are exciting items. The knife has Lawrence's initials burned into the handle and there are similar initials carved on Lawrence's Lee Enfield Rifle which is in The Imperial War Museum. 'It is wonderful for such an item to emerge and one can only guess about whether it was with Lawrence in the desert. 'The helmet dates from 1916 when Lawrence was in the desert and and agal is typical of what he wore.' The pocket knife is expected to sell for 300 pounds and the pith helmet for up to 600 pounds. The sale takes place on December 13. Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Edward Lawrence became a household name for his part in the Arab Revolt, but the fame didn't sit easily with him. After the war he changed his name, joined the RAF and was based in remote British India. He was forced to return to Britain when rumours circulated that he was involved in espionage activities. In 1932 he was stationed in East Cowes on the Isle of Wight where he specialised in building high-speed rescue boats for the RAF and the Royal Navy. Lawrence died age 46 after crashing his Brough Superior SS100 motorbike near to his home in Dorset. He died six days after the crash, giving rise to conspiracy theories that he had been deliberately run off the road by government agencies.

Bedroom antics and risqué lingerie might not be the first things that come to mind which you think of the city of Norwich. Famed for its historical architecture and surrounding countryside, the East Anglian town is apparently hiding a more saucy side. The city’s 44-55 year-old women buy more erotic lingerie than any other in the UK. Women aged 44-55 in Norwich buy more sexy underwear than women in any other city . Both Jane Fonda, 74, left, and Kim Cattrall, 57, say that their sex lives have improved as they've got older . The survey, which looked at the spending habits on erotic lingerie of women aged 45-55 across the UK, found that Sheffield came second to Norwich for lingerie sales, followed by Manchester in third. The lowest spending towns were found to be Milton Keynes, Inverness and Woking. A more liberated sexual attitude in recent years and the popularity of erotic fiction like Fifty Shades of Grey is thought to be behind the trend for women over 40 becoming more sexually assertive. Hit TV shows such as Cougar Town and Sex And The City have also shown a more liberated side to older women and encouraged women to celebrate their sexual side, resulting in a boom in lingerie sales by women in this age range. Last year, 74-year-old Jane Fonda revealed she was having the 'best sex' of her life with long term partner Richard Perry, who is four years younger than her. Norwich is more known for its historical architecture, such as the beautiful Cathedral, pictured, than erotic activities . She said at the time: ‘At 74, I have never had such a fulfilling sex life. When I was young I had so many inhibitions - I didn't know what I desired.’ Kim Cattrall, 57, who played seductress Samantha Jones in Sex and the City, also championed embracing sex regardless of your age. The actress said she enjoyed making love more after she reached the age of 40, particularly with younger men. She said earlier this year: ‘I enjoyed my best sex life after the age of 40, I lost my virginity at the age of 15 and thought, 'is that it'? TV shows such as Sex and the City have shown a more liberated side to older women . She added: ‘I like the fact I have saved my best years for last.’ According to recent surveys, over 50s are having more sex than they were six years ago. A third of the age group said they enjoyed sex more than in their youth and four in five of those in their early 50s made love regularly. Emily Bendell, founder of Bluebella, who conducted the survey, said: . ‘Older women really know who they are and what they like – and nothing is more enticing and attractive than that inner confidence. As taboos lift, more and more women are now dating men years younger than her and naturally she wants to look as alluring as she can. 1 Norwich . 2 Sheffield . 3 Manchester . 4 Leeds . 5 Edinburgh . 6 Bath . 7 Liverpool . 8 Plymouth . 9 Cardiff . 10 Glasgow . 1 Milton Keynes . 2 Inverness . 3 Woking . 4 Preston . 5 Oxford (pictured, Balliol College, Oxford) ‘Female celebrities such as Jane Fonda and Kim Cattrall have been unashamed to admit their sex life improved in later life and it's inspiring to an older generation who are not content to kiss goodbye to their sex lives after children or grandchildren! ‘And let's not forget the hit TV show Cougar Town starring Courtney Cox who is seen parading around in her underwear and looks beautiful. ‘Our statistics are proof that older women not only want to prolong their sex lives, but they want to enjoy them too - with their husbands, boyfriends or perhaps a toyboy.’ Emily added: ‘Feedback tells us our underwear empowers women of any age. ‘Of course, women are gaining more power generally so that means they have confidence to take control in all aspects of their lives and set the rules, including those in the bedroom and men like to see an inner dominatrix unleashed. ‘There must be some very happy husbands and boyfriends in Norwich.’","Norwich's fiftysomething women are Britain's highest spenders on lingerie .

A stray dog who ran an incredible 1,100 miles across China with a group of cyclists has finally found a basket to call her own. Internet sensation Xiao Sa had the good fortune of being adopted by one of her new friends from the race and flown to their home in Wuhan, Hubei province. The cross-country cyclists bade their canine companion farewell as she was packed into a crate to embark on a fresh adventure - living with cyclist Zhang Heng. Ruff solution: Plucky Xiao Sa is now safe and sound back at home in Wuhan with her owner . World famous: The cyclists bid goodbye to their final teammate after she shared their epic, mountainous journey . Xiao Sa followed the team's race for 24 days along 1,100 miles of highway from Kangding, Sichuan Province to Lhasa in Tibet. Nobody knows where the white dog came from, but she has now been flown back from Tibet to the home of Mr Heng. Xiao Sa has been dubbed the 'dog with determination' and the micro blog 'Go Go Xiao Sa', which details her adventures, has attracted more than 37,000 followers. Speaking of the moment he first met Xiao Sa on highway G318 in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Mr Heng said: 'She was lying tired on the street so we fed her and then she followed our team'. Fluffy friend: Xiao Sa at home with members of the cycle team after becoming an internet sensation as they blogged her run from Sichuan Province to Lhasa in Tibet . From that point on, Xiao Sa followed them the entire way, climbing 10 mountains higher than 4,000m. Mr Heng, 22, said: 'I and Xiao Sa met on the road, but she recognised me as a good friend and owner. I won't leave her alone.' After that, 'Little Sa' simply refused to stop following. Since then she has become a celebrity in her homeland and a micro blog recording her life online has attracted more than 37,000 followers in two weeks. Lovable pooch: Mr Heng, a student in Wuhan, Hubei province, had decided to cycle to Llasa as a graduation trip with friends when he met a lonely dog . Courageous canine: Xiao Sa never left the side of the cyclists as she ran through the rocky terrain beside them . More than 4,000 comments on a micro blog online were left congratulating her after a picture was posted of Xiao Sa in the arms of her new friend in front of the Llasa's Potala Palace. Mr Heng, a student in Wuhan, Hubei province, had decided to cycle to Llasa as a graduation trip with friends when he met a lonely dog. They thought she was following for fun, but found she insisted on sticking around them day and night. One of the gang: Xiao Sa with the riders travelled more than 1,100 miles together . The dog became a celebrity in her homeland and a micro blog recording her life online attracted more than 37,000 followers . 'We felt she might want to come along with us, so we decided to bring her along to the end.' A week later, Mr Zhang and his friends opened the micro blog account for her. 'We thought the dog was encouraging us, and wanted others to know its story,' he told  China Daily. They created the name Xiao Sa by combining xiao, meaning 'little', with the last syllable of Lhasa. During their journey, Xiao Sa, Zhang and his team covered 1,138 miles and climbed 10 mountains higher than 4,000m. Xiao Sa's journey started when cyclist Mr Heng, 22, gave her food on highway G318 in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau . Xiao Sa just ran up the mountains or along dirt roads. 'Many people stopped cycling in some sections, then took the bus, but the dog made it,' he said. Zhang put the dog on the back of the bike when the team was riding downhill. 'The speed can reach 43 miles per hour, impossible for the dog to catch us.' Then word began to spread of the cyclist and the homeless dog. Don't let me go: Student Mr Heng gave the lonely dog a bite to eat and it didn't look back . Wang Penghao, 24, from Jiuzhaigou, Sichuan province, said: 'I've heard about her from other friends who rode to Lhasa on the road before I met her. 'They told me to take care of her if I saw her, and give her some food and water like they did. 'She followed us for three days, running behind our team but sometimes leading us. She's very smart and knows the route, because she never got lost even when we passed through mountains.' After following Wang, the dog lagged behind and met another cyclist, Wang Zi, on May 4. 'She may be the first dog who ran to Lhasa along this route,' said Wang Zi, who was followed by the dog one day. Back on the road again: The dog and his friends built up a massive following online after word got out about their trip . 'I have a special feeling about her, especially when I found she was never lost, waited for us at milestones on the road, and ran all the time, making me feel that she never feels tired,' he said. Wang Zi will continue to the foot of Qomolangma, known as Mount Everest in the West, after he arrives in Lhasa. 'If possible, I would like to take the dog with me, taking her to see a more splendid scene.' Mr Heng, who accompanied Xiao Sa for 20 days, called her 'a buddy and a friend'. 'I would like to take the dog home and take care of her. She has been a stray on the road for a long time. She needs a home.'","New friend Zhang Heng adopted the blogging dog .

The same jury of fellow pastors that convicted Rev. Frank Schaefer on Monday of breaking his vows also told him he must surrender his credentials if he can't reconcile his new calling to the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community with the laws from the church's Book of Discipline. Schaefer told reporters afterward that he had no intention of changing his mind and said he expects to lose his credentials in 30 days. The Reverend Frank Schaefer, of Lebanon Pennsylvania, walks back to the trial after a lunch break at Camp Innabah, a United Methodist retreat. He was suspended under church law today for breaking his vows by officiating his gay sons' Massachusetts wedding in 2007 . Before the punishment was announced, Schaefer, who was convicted for officiating at his son's 2007 wedding ceremony in Massachusetts, told the jury Tuesday that he is unrepentant and refused to promise he wouldn't perform more gay unions. Rather than beg for mercy, the pastor upped the stakes. The church 'needs to stop judging people based on their sexual orientation,' he told jurors. 'We have to stop the hate speech. We have to stop treating them as second-class Christians.' After the jury pronounced its sentence, Schaefer's supporters began overturning chairs in the courtroom - symbolizing the biblical story of Jesus overturning the tables of the money changers - and held an impromptu communion service. Schaefer's trial rekindled debate within the nation's largest mainline Protestant denomination over church policies on homosexuality and same-sex marriage. The denomination accepts gay and lesbian members, but it rejects the practice of homosexuality as 'incompatible with Christian teaching'. Schaefer donned a rainbow-colored stole on the witness stand and told jurors it symbolized his commitment to the cause. 'I will never be silent again,' he said, as some of his supporters wept in the gallery. 'This is what I have to do.' The Rev. Frank Schaefer and his son Tim whose same-sex marriage he officiated in Massachusetts in 2007 . Jon Boger, who filed the initial complaint against Schaefer, was outraged by the pastor's recalcitrance. The career Naval officer grew up in Zion United Methodist Church of Iona, the church that Schaefer has led for 11 years. 'Frank Schaefer sat here and openly rebuked the United Methodist Church, its policies, standards and doctrines,' Bolger said when called as a rebuttal witness. 'He should no longer be in service as a minister of the United Methodist Church, not at Iona, not anywhere else.' Earlier Tuesday, the Methodists' prosecutor called former members of Schaefer's church who said his conduct split the congregation, and experts who said the punishment should serve as a deterrent to other like-minded clergy. Christina Watson said her family left Schaefer's church because they no longer wanted to be 'subjected to the preaching and teaching' of Schaefer. Church congregant Ellen Ross, left, and Clydette Overturf, pastoral assistant, speak to the media, during the penalty hearing of the Rev. Frank Schaefer . 'To me, it wasn't a good Christian example for ministers to say it's OK to break the rules of your church,' she testified. The Rev. Paul Stallworth, who leads a United Methodist task force on sexuality and abortion, testified that church law requires jurors to 'openly rebuke' Schaefer so that fellow clergy will think twice before breaking it. Schaefer had previously testified that he performed his son's 2007 wedding in Massachusetts out of love, not a desire to flout church teaching on homosexuality. But Tuesday's testimony made clear he has had a change of heart. 'I have to minister to those who hurt and that's what I'm doing,' said Schaefer. The prosecutor, the Rev. Christopher Fisher, invited Schaefer to 'repent of your actions' and pledge never again to perform a homosexual union. 'I cannot,' Schaefer replied. His son, Tim Schaefer, told jurors he knew he was putting his father in a difficult position by asking him to officiate his wedding. But he concluded he would hurt his father's feelings if he didn't ask. Schaefer said he hoped his father's trial would start a larger conversation in the denomination.

A six-year-old Massachusetts cheerleader is refusing to let cancer get in the way of helping her squad raise thousands of dollars for charity. Riley Fessenden, who had a rare form of nasal cancer diagnosed in May, has continued taking part in practices and competitions with her squad. And, when her team heard about a fundraiser to take part in a New England Patriots game, she helped them raise more than $2,500 in one weekend. Determined: Six-year-old Riley and her cheerleading squad have been raising money for cancer research . 'She is tougher than any guy I know,' Todd Fessenden said of his daughter Riley, who wears a headband emblazoned with the slogan 'Fights like a girl'. Since finding out she has a type of cancer called Esthesioneuroblastoma, Riley has had to have radiation treatments, but she was always ready for cheerleading practice. 'We practice three, four . times a week ... they are little girls. They get tired,' assistant coach Jennifer Burnett said. 'A lot of times [Riley comes] straight from radiation . treatment,' Ms Burnett said, telling 7 News that she 'never has a single complaint'. Head coach Relli Roesener added that Riley was the 'hardest working girl on the team'. When she is too ill to make it to practice, her sister Meghan who is also on the team, keeps her updated. Riley's family had already been raising funds through the Riley Rocks website, where they sell wrist bands and advertize events, such as a carnival they held, to help cover the cost of her treatment. 'The hospital bills, even with insurance, are already thousands of dollars, and they have only just begun,' Riley's aunt, Sally, told the Benicia Herald. Energetic: Despite being on a course of radiation treatment Riley rarely misses cheerleading practice . But when the little girl's Beverly Titans' squad heard about a nationwide cheerleading contest to raise funds for cancer, they jumped at the chance to raise money for a wider cause. As part of the state-wide Cheer for Dana-Farber, Riley and her squad have been holding a dance and bake sale to raise the minimum $1,000 needed to be entered into a draw to cheer at a Patriots game. They more than exceeded their goal, raising $5,000 before the main fundraiser, and bringing in $2,500 in just one weekend. Every $1,000 brought in is another chance to have the squad's name added into the draw. 'It is very overwhelming. There is a lot . of people over here. Way more than we originally expected,' Riley's mother, Kamie Huston, said. Assistant coach Ms Burnett added: 'We . would never have been able to do something like this without so many . people helping us. But it's been really amazing. I didn't expect this at . all.' Riley and the Titans find out at the beginning of December if they have won the chance to perform at the December 29 game.","Riley Fessenden is having treatment for a rare form of cancer .

Former White House aide to Bill Clinton, Sidney Blumenthal, has spent the past few years writing a trilogy about the life of another president - Abraham Lincoln. Blumenthal has a deal with Simon & Schuster, the publisher announced today. The three-volume biography has the working title 'Abraham Lincoln: A Political Life' and the first book, 'A Self-Made Man,' is scheduled to come out in 2015. Sidney Blumenthal (left) seen speaking to the press following testimony in the Bill Clinton sex scandal in 1998 (Bill Clinton pictured in 1998, right) Blumenthal will be edited by Alice Mayhew, whose other projects have included Doris Kearns Goodwin's million-selling Lincoln book 'Team of Rivals.' 'I was privileged to work in the White House,' Blumenthal said in a statement released by Simon & Schuster. 'I have admired and studied President Lincoln', Blumenthal said (Lincoln portrait from 1821) 'I have admired and studied President Lincoln for many years. My personal experience with the politics of the presidency inside the White House gave me a fresh appreciation and a new view of for Lincoln's immense political skills and a new way of looking at how he became America's greatest political leader.' During a recent telephone interview with The Associated Press, Blumenthal said he had already completed all three volumes, each more than 500 pages, and had waited until he finished before seeking a publisher. Negotiations were handled by another man used to working with presidents, Washington attorney Robert Barnett, whose other clients include Clinton and President Barack Obama. Although Blumenthal wrote a cover story on Lincoln for Newsweek last year, he said he had kept his biography a secret from everybody except his 'wife and dog'. Blumenthal, 65, is a longtime journalist and the author of several previous books, including a memoir about his years in the Clinton administration. Acknowledging the tonnage of Lincoln books that precede his, he said he wanted his Lincoln trilogy to 'get to the root of the conflicts that still perplex us and conflict us.' 'Many of the fundamental issues from his time still remain,' he said, citing race and the role of the federal government.","Sidney Blumenthal was the White House aide to Bill Clinton and served as his adviser from 1997 to 2001 .

The Mexican-registered jet took off from Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport carrying two pilots, a doctor and a nurse, the Coast Guard said. The plane crashed into the sea after reporting mechanical problems, reported NBC Miami. Emergency personnel arrived on the scene to see a large debris field and two bodies – a male and a female – which were immediately recovered. It is not yet clear who was pulled from the ocean. The crashed jet is often used as an air ambulance, sources at the airport told Local 10.

Circuit Court of Appeals after Black Bear prevailed in district court. The appeals court agreed with the district court in a decision Friday, . saying Starbucks didn't prove its case. Charbucks, introduced in 1997, is Black Bear's darkest roast coffee. The appeals court noted that 'one of the reasons Black Bear used the term ""Charbucks"" was the public perception that Starbucks roasted its beans unusually darkly.' But it agreed with the district court in finding minimal similarity and weak evidence of actual association between the brands. Under fire: They were sued in 2001 in federal district court in New York by Starbucks, which alleged Black Bear's use of the name 'Charbucks' infringed, blurred and tarnished its famous trademarks . 'Their sales haven't been hurt,' Mrs Clark said, noting that Black Bear's haven't changed much over the years. 'Their growth hasn't been hurt.' Seattle-based Starbucks respects but disagrees with the court's decision, company spokesman Zack Hutson said. 'We're just a mom-and-pop little roastery - Starbucks' sales haven't been hurt' 'We only filed the suit after a prolonged but unsuccessful attempt to enlist Black Bear's cooperation and to resolve this matter without litigation,' Mr Hutson said Monday. Starbucks is a responsible trademark owner and was asking only for an injunction against the use of 'Charbucks,' he said. The case did not involve monetary damages. Starbucks can ask for a rare hearing before the full appeals court. They also can appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Lexi's ability to balance on almost anything also extends to concrete pillars, bike racks and a toilet seat . From fire hydrants to basketball hoops, it seems that nothing is beyond her abilities. Her repertoire doesn't stop there either, as she can also run, hop and jump her away across fences, down balustrades and between concrete pillars. The dog has even mastered a gazelle-like leap from high-up places, such as a garage roof, back into the waiting arms of her owners. As well as balancing, Lexi has been taught to navigate a range of obstacles. Here she deftly tackles a stack of hay bales, leaping across them and off the other side . Lexi's repertoire of tricks even extends to climbing ladders, as she demonstrates here . Online some have compared Lexi to a mountain goat, and as she leaps from rock to rock it is easy to see why . Lexi was rescued from the Scottish SPCA in 2009 when she was severely underweight, had behavior issues and hair missing around her neck. The ten-month-old dog had a hard start but since then has found fame online thanks to her amazing tricks. Boarder Collies are otherwise known as sheep dogs and are bred for their intelligence, energy, obedience and ability to learn a range of commands quickly. While Lexi's balance is perfect, she may need to improve her riding skills as she's facing the wrong way . They are often used in films and advertising because they are friendly and easy to control. Labradors are more laid back than Collies but are equally intelligent and responsive to training, so it is easy to see how Lexi picked up on all of her tricks.

Fears are growing for a British refugee worker after he went missing on a hike in the North Caucasus mountains. John Stiles, a University of York graduate who was head of the Danish Refugee Council's North Caucasus branch, went missing on November 10. The 52-year-old disappeared after going on a one-day hike in the mountains near Fiagdon River, in Russia’s Ossetia Republic. The skilled climber has not been seen since, and with heavy snow forecast for later this week, hopes of finding him alive are dwindling. Despite launching a rescue investigation almost immediately, Russian security officials have since refused to comment on how the operation is going, what the next step is and what the chances are of finding Stiles.

In solemnity, thousands gathered at a central Pennsylvania battlefield park on Tuesday to honor a speech given 150 years ago that President Abraham Lincoln predicted would not be long remembered. The inspirational and famously short Gettysburg Address was praised for reinvigorating national ideals of freedom, liberty and justice amid a Civil War that had torn the country into pieces. 'President Lincoln sought to heal a nation's wounds by defining what a nation should be,' said Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett, calling Lincoln's words superb, his faith deep and his genius profound. 'Lincoln wrote his words on paper, but he also inscribed them in our hearts.' Scroll down for video .

Come all ye: Audience members listen to remarks during the commemoration. Lincoln's speech was first delivered in Gettysburg nearly five months after the major battle that left tens of thousands of men wounded, dead or missing . Echoing Lincoln, keynote speaker and Civil War historian James McPherson said the president took the dais in November 1863 at a time when it looked like the nation 'might indeed perish from the earth'. 'The Battle of Gettysburg became the hinge of fate on which turned the destiny of that nation and its new birth of freedom,' McPherson said. In the July 1863 battle, considered the turning point of the war, federal forces fought back a Confederate invasion of Pennsylvania. Lincoln's speech was delivered more than four months later, at the dedication of a national cemetery to bury the battle's casualties. In the short oration, he spoke of how democracy itself rested upon 'the proposition that all men are created equal,' a profound and politically risky statement for the time. Slavery and the doctrine of states' rights would not hold in the 'more perfect union' of Lincoln's vision.

Stands out in a crowd: A re-enactor stands with audience members during a ceremony commemorating the 150th anniversary of the dedication of the Soldiers' National Cemetery and President Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address . 'In 272 words he put together what everyone was thinking, what everyone should know,' said park historian John Heiser. Because of varying transcriptions, scholars generally put the text at 268 to 272 words. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia administered the oath of allegiance to a group of 16 immigrants, telling them the national identity is unique, illustrated by the existence of the word 'un-American' and by the people's 'fidelity to certain political principles'. Greta Myer, 44, decided to make the six-hour trip from Akron, Ohio, with her husband and son after spending a week in Gettysburg earlier in the year. 'It's something we've never done before,' Myer said. 'It was a historical event that we wanted to be a part of.' Among many re-enactors on the grounds were at least two Abraham Lincolns, including one who recited the address.

Audience members listen to remarks during a ceremony commemorating the 150th anniversary of the dedication of the Soldiers' National Cemetery and President Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2013, in Gettysburg, Pa. 'Would they preserve that heritage, or would they allow it to perish from the earth?' McPherson said. He said the Gettysburg Address, despite its short length, managed to weave together themes of past, present and future; continent, nation and battlefield; and birth, death and rebirth. 'Men died that the nation might live,' McPherson said. 'Yet the old nation also died,' and with it, the system of bondage that enslaved some four million Americans. Part of the event was a speech delivered by suburban Philadelphia high school junior Lauren Pyfer, who won a contest to write a contemporary version of the Gettysburg Address, but at the same short length. The battle: Dated July 1863, dead soldiers lie on the battlefield at Gettysburg, where 23,000 Union troops and 25,000 Confederate troops were killed during the Civil War.

She urged the crowd to do their part to 'nurture and preserve the rights of humanity, equality and freedom, across all nations'. 'It is impossible for one country to close its doors to other countries and still thrive,' Pyfer said. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell, who also adopted Lincolnian brevity, said the Gettysburg battle stands at the vortex of American history, and the Gettysburg Address at the vortex of national consciousness. Lincoln, she said, called the country to its unfinished business, and he also came to symbolize the country's 'greatest virtues of humility, of honesty and decency'. Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth upon this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. (Applause.) Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle field of that war; we are met to dedicate a portion of it as the final resting place of those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this, but in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground.The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or to detract. (Applause.) The world will little note, nor long remember, what we say here; but it can never forget what they did here. (Applause.) It is for us, the living, rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work that they have thus far so nobly carried on. (Applause.) It is rather for us here to be dedicated to the great task remaining before us; that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion; that we here highly resolve that the dead shall not have died in vain. (Applause.) That the nation shall, under God, have a new birth of freedom, and that the government of the people, by the people and for the people, shall not perish from the earth.

The Pope has once again shown his willingness to break with tradition by bowing to Muslim royal Queen Rania of Jordan. As leader of the world's 1.2billion-strong Catholic community, protocol usually dictates that visitors bow to him when they meet him at the Vatican. But when Rania came to the Holy See with her husband King Abdullah II on Thursday, he inverted that formality by lowering his head to her. Milady: Pope Francis bows as he shakes hands with the beautiful Queen Rania of Jordan after they shared a private audience that also included her husband King Abdullah in the pontiff's private library . Beautiful: A Vatican official said Pope Francis 'is not interested in protocol' He made no discernible bow toward her husband, the king. The Jordanian royals were leaving following a private audience with the pope in his library. 'Francis behaves as he did before he became pope and is not interested in protocol', a senior Vatican official told the Daily Telegraph. Up until the 19th century, those meeting the pope stoop to kiss his slippers and, to this day, the tradition remains that all visitors, including women, bow to him, the official said. The surprise move came after Pope Francis showed he is well in touch with what's popular in society today by posing for a 'selfie' with young Italian pilgrims in St Peter's Basilica, Vatican City. It may be something more associated with the Justin Bieber, Victoria Beckham and Kelly Brook, but the leader of the Catholic Church showed he is more-than aware of today's hot topics. Special: These youngsters will have a photo to treasure for the rest of their lives . Seen it all before: The teenage pilgrims show Pope Francis their technology - but it appears he is well in tune with modern life . The head of 1.2 billion Catholics worldwide has already amassed more than three million followers on the social networking site Twitter, with his latest offering believed to be the first ever 'papal selfie'. Around 500 teenagers had travelled from the Diocese of Piacenza and Bobbio for a pilgrimage, and shared a private audience with the pontiff. He was also presented a gift from his followers of a portrait of Jesus wearing a crown of thorns. Pope Francis has made a concerted effort to understand and integrate with worldwide youth since he succeeded Pope Benedict XVI. This was demonstrated when he attended Brazil's World Youth Day, with tens of thousands of people greeting him as he urged young Catholics to 'make disciples of all nations.'

In what is possibly his last interview before his execution on Wednesday in Missouri, serial killer Joseph Paul Franklin has admitted to killing 22 people - 17 more murders than he has been convicted of. The self-confessed neo-Nazi, who had a pathological hatred of blacks, Jews and interracial couples is scheduled to die by lethal injection at the Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center in Bonne Terre. Confirming that he was responsible for the cold-blooded execution-style deaths of 'approximately' 22 people, Franklin showed sparse remorse as he attempted to justify his killings - which famously included an attempt on the life of Hustler porn supremo Larry Flynt - who incredibly has tried to stop his shooters execution. Murderer: Joseph Paul Franklin is scheduled to die by lethal injection at 12.01am on Wednesday and showed no remorse in what could be his last interview . Joseph Paul Franklin is scheduled to die by lethal injection at 12.01am on Wednesday for the sniper killing of 42-year-old Gerald Gordon outside a suburban St. Louis synagogue in 1977. Following his arrest in 1980, Franklin told detectives that he selected the St Louis synagogue from the Yellow Pages of the telephone directory because he wanted to 'find a Jew and kill him' Franklin was also convicted of killing an interracial couple in Madison, Wisconsin in 1977, two black joggers in Salt Lake City in 1980, a two teenage black boys and bombing a synagogue in Chattanooga, Tennessee in 1977. 'I felt like I was at war. The survival of the white race was at stake,' said Franklin to Kyung Lah of CNN. 'I consider it my mission, my three-year mission. Same length of time Jesus was on his mission, from the time he was 30 to 33.' Death row: Joseph Paul Franklin is scheduled to . die by lethal injection at 12.01am on Wednesday for the sniper killing . of 42-year-old Gerald Gordon outside a suburban St. Louis synagogue in . 1977 . Investigators believe Franklin, fueled by a hatred of blacks and Jews, committed many more crimes in several states. He has reportedly confessed to at least 22 killings, 16 bank robberies and other crimes during the late 1970s until he was caught after the Salt Lake City killings in 1980. Among his alleged crimes were two high-profile shootings — of civil rights leader Vernon Jordan in Fort Wayne, Indiana, in 1980, and the man he calls his 'old pal' - porn baron Larry Flynt in Lawrenceville, Georgia, in 1978. Both men survived. Franklin believed that he was going to start a race war and his preferred method to kill his victims was to stalk them and set up a sniper's nest from which he would shoot his victim's from distance. Born James Clayton Vaughn in Mobile, Alabama, Franklin attempted to blame his upbringing for his murderous cruelty. Offending magazine: These are the front covers from the 1975 edition of Hustler magazine that enraged Joseph Paul Franklin . 'My momma didn't care about us,' he said as he complained he wasn't fed properly and not allowed to play with other children. Finding another family in the white supremacist groups in the American South in the 1960s, Franklin was moved to action after he read Adolf Hitler's political manifesto, 'Mein Kampf'. 'I've never felt that way about any other book that I read. It was something weird about that book.' At 26, he changed his name to Joseph Paul Franklin. Joseph Paul to honor  Paul Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda minister, and Franklin after Benjamin Franklin. He even attempted to link himself to infamous serial killer Charles Manson by having the words 'Helter Skelter' tattooed on his arm in reference to Manson's inspiration provided by The Beatles 'White Album'. However, the tattoo artist refused. As he began his killings, Franklin said he hoped his murders would prove to act as an example. Hatred: . The neo-nazi has also been convicted of killing an interracial couple . in Madison, Wisconsin in 1977, two black joggers in Salt Lake City in . 1980 and bombing a synagogue in Chattanooga, Tennessee in 1977 . 'I figured once I started doing it and showed them how, other white supremacists would do the same thing.' In one incredulous claim, Franklin said that the communities he targeted now have members who love him. 'When you commit a crime against a certain group of people, a bonding takes place. It seems like you belong to them,' he said. In addition to the murder of Gordon outside a a bar mitzvah, Franklin was convicted of killing Alphonse Manning and Toni Schwean in Madison, Wisconsin, because they were an interracial couple. He also confessed to shooting dead college student Rebecca Bergstrom, all because she told him in passing that she dated a Jamaican man. His most shocking murder was that of 13-year-old Dante Evans and his cousin 14-year-old Darrell Lane in Cincinnati -  two African Americans jogging with white female friends. Joseph Deters, who prosecuted that Cincinnati case said, 'He's just a creep. There's no other way to describe him. And what he did to those two kids because of the color of their skin is incomprehensible.' Victim: Larry Flynt says he doesn't to see the man who shot him put to death . Hustler chief Flynt was standing trial on an obscenity charge in Georgia in 1978 when he was wounded by a sniper's bullet. No one was arrested at the time. Franklin was housed in federal prison in Marion, Ill., in the mid-1990s when he confessed to shooting Flynt. Gwinnett County, Ga., District Attorney Danny Porter said he is convinced Franklin shot Flynt because Franklin provided information only the shooter would know — details about the shooting location, the type of weapon used, even the maker of the gun. Franklin said he shot the pornographer because of a magazine front cover showing an interracial couple. 'I saw that interracial couple he had, photographed there, having sex,' said Franklin to CNN, referring to the December 1975 issue of Hustler . 'It just made me sick. I think whites marry with whites, blacks with blacks, Indians with Indians. Orientals with orientals. I threw the magazine down and thought, I'm gonna kill that guy.' However, Porter said opted against filing charges because Franklin had already been convicted of multiple killings and said it didn't make sense to bring him back to Georgia to face trial for shooting Flynt. Incredibly, Flynt has become an unlikely supporter of Franklin's - in so much as he doesn't want him to face the death penalty. He would rather he spent the rest of his life behind bars. 'The government has no business at all being in the business of killing people,' said Flynt. '(It's) much more punishment to put somebody in prison for the rest of their lives than it is to snip their life out in a few seconds with a lethal injection.' As for Franklin, he claims he has cured himself of mental illness through education and is hoping not to be executed. 'Well I'm hoping to get a stay. It might not happen, but if it does, I'm willing to accept the will of the Lord.'","Neo-nazi Joseph Paul Franklin murdered five people between 1977 and 1980 .

School reforms risk creating ‘exam robots’ who can pass tests but struggle to succeed in life, the business leaders have warned. John Cridland, the head of the CBI, warned Michael Gove’s focus on ‘rigour’ in education risked squeezing out the skills needed by employers. And he hit out at teachers with no experience from outside the classroom who do not see the value of pupils doing work experience. John Cridland, head of the CBI, (left) warned Michael Gove's school reforms risked creating 'exam robots' Mr Gove, Education Secretary, has ordered an end to almost all GCSE coursework and a return to make-or-break exams at the end of two-year courses of study. He argues an overhauled national curriculum ‘embodies rigour and high standards’, with renewed focus on grammar, spelling and punctuation. But Mr Cridland said businesses want school leavers to also have creativity, curiosity, tenacity and good manners. Plans to teach more dates and facts about history risk turning children off the subject, the authotu of Horrible Histories has warned. Terry Deary told The Times 'History should be peoplecentred, not fact-centred.' He added: 'W.B. Yeats said ""education isn't about filling buckets, it's about lighting fires"". 'That should be written on parchment, rolled up and stuffed down Mr Gove's throat.' He told The Times: ‘Employers want young people who are enthusiastic, confident, creative and resilient, not just exam robots. ‘It has got more difficult for schools. I think what [Mr Gove] has done is necessary but not sufficient . ‘He should talk about rigour and we should be more rigorous and he has my vote to do that. If all you do is talk about rigour then the rounded and groundedness gets squeezed out. ‘When I walk into a really inspirational school there is a whole education experience and all the components of that school contribute to that educational experience.’ Mr Cridland will use a speech today to urge headteachers to do more to prepare young people for the world of work. He suggests Ofsted inspectors should look at everything schools do, including spot, clubs and extra-curricular activities, and not just their academic performance. Mr Cridland added: ‘It would help if more teachers and head teachers had experience outside the classroom. ‘We should try to encourage that, so they don't go from school to university, teacher training, back into the classroom without having stepped out of the education world into the world they are helping to serve.’","John Cridland warns the focus on 'rigour' risks squeezing out other skills .

David Dimbleby says the BBC is too powerful for its own good and should be dramatically slimmed down . The BBC is too powerful for its own good and should be dramatically slimmed down, one of its top stars argued today. David Dimbleby – who has been at the Corporation for more than 50 years – called on the director-general to hand out the licence fee to its commercial rivals to create ‘more variety’ in TV and radio output. He said the BBC should ‘cut out some of the gardening and the cookery’ on TV, merge BBC4 with BBC2, and reduce its online presence to prevent it ‘crushing’ local newspapers. The 75-year-old, who has anchored every general election since 1979, also criticised the BBC’s ‘terrible’ coverage of last year’s Diamond Jubilee River Pageant, saying he was ‘rueful’ he hadn’t been asked to front it. Mr Dimbleby’s intervention will add to mounting pressure on director-general Tony Hall to accept dramatic cuts to his budget when the licence fee is renegotiated. Earlier this month, former head of TV news Roger Mosey admitted the BBC was too big and too left wing, and also suggested the licence fee should be shared with rivals and the number of TV channels reduced. Speaking to Richard Bacon on 5Live today, Mr Dimbleby said: ‘The public pay for the BBC is £3.5billion, more or less. It’s a very, very powerful, big organisation, so it’s right that it should be held to book, and of course when it gets something wrong... it’s a spectacular fall, as with the River Pageant.’ The Question Time host said the BBC needed to redefine its role when the Royal Charter is renewed in 2016. In the past month, senior Government figures have warned the BBC may face severe cuts unless it improves its coverage and addresses accusations of bias. Mr Dimbleby said: ‘[The management need] to answer questions about whether the BBC has got too big. Whether it is too powerful for its own good. Whether it’s crushing newspapers, local newspapers particularly. I think there is some truth in that. I’m not sure how you address it but I do think the BBC needs to pull back a bit from some of the things it does, maybe cut back a bit on some of its television channels. ‘I think that BBC4 for instance which has some very good high quality programming done on a shoe string, really on a shoe string... merge that with BBC2, cut out some of the gardening and the cookery and all that on BBC2 and focus on the quality stuff that it was meant to be. Then you have two big channels, One and Two.’ 'Terrible': The broadcaster criticised BBC coverage of last year's Diamond Jubilee River Pageant . Mr Dimbleby admitted he may be ‘taken to the cleaners’ by his bosses for criticising the BBC so openly. But he added: ‘If you have one organisation that controls so much of the airwaves, is that in the end democratic?’ He continued: ‘I would use some of the licence fee to set up or to subsidise other independent radio and broadcast stations, so that you’ve got variety.’ Last week, Home Secretary Theresa May accused the BBC of undermining democracy by encroaching unfairly on local newspapers with its news websites. Mr Dimbleby – who sold his family’s local newspaper business for £12million in 2001 – agreed with her assessment and suggested BBC websites should be slimmed down. He said: ‘I think the question has to be addressed about the scale of the BBC, and people need to ask themselves, however well run it is, however careful it is, however much it attempts to be objective, in the end, is democracy well served by that? Last week, Home Secretary Theresa May accused the BBC of undermining democracy by encroaching unfairly on local newspapers with its news websites . ‘Should we have more voices on the air, both on television and on radio, and should we pull back a bit on the thing [former director-general] John Birt set up so brilliantly at its time, which is the internet, to allow space for local papers and indeed the national press which at the moment are being steamrollered by what we do with public money that comes in from the licence fee, for which you go to prison if you fail to pay up.’ Asked for his opinion of the BBC’s much-criticised coverage of the River Pageant, Mr Dimbleby said: ‘I thought it was terrible. I don’t know what they thought they were doing frankly, but they thought that the pageant itself, the boats on the river, wouldn’t really work and it would be technically difficult. ‘So they thought they’d have lots of side shows and the presenters wouldn’t have to know about the boats, and they’d have some expert who knew about the boats. Then everything collapsed and the expert couldn’t be got on air.’","Dimbleby called on BBC to 'cut out some of the gardening and cookery'

The patient, a diabetic mother-of-three, was suffering from depression and the GP arranged for her to have counselling. The two bonded when they realised they both had three daughters and were fans of Monty Python, the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service heard. But the relationship broke down when Dr Brown’s wife discovered flirtatious text messages from the patient on her husband’s mobile phone. The woman, referred to as Patient A, told Brown’s partners about the affair and they reported him to the General Medical Council (GMC). Ms Natasha Tahta, for the GMC, said: ‘She felt, looking back, she had been manipulated by Dr Brown and decided to speak out because of the impact it had on her family and over concern it might happen to someone else in the future.’ Dr Brown admitted having an inappropriate sexual relationship at a fitness to practise hearing in Manchester. If he is found guilty of misconduct over the affair, he could face being struck off the medical register. The GMC allege the . inappropriate relationship started in November 2010 and continued up . until last July, but the doctor claims it only lasted between March and . July 2012. He says the relationship began to develop when Patient A was discharged from hospital at the end of February 2012 after an operation to amputate a toe. The hearing was told that during one consultation Dr Brown hugged the patient and rubbed the small of her back to comfort her before giving her his email address. Giving evidence from behind a screen, Patient A told the panel: ‘It was quite difficult to get around but said I would maybe find it easier to email my thoughts to him. ‘We were sat on the sofa together. He put his arms around me and rubbed the small of my back because I was upset,’ she added. ‘It was the depression and how vulnerable I was, but that is the way that he consoled me.’ The pair began to exchange friendly personal emails, swapping details and pictures of family members. Meet: The pair, who met at the Uplands and Mumbles Surgery, the Uplands Surgery of which is pictured, after Patient A had an operation in 2012 . ‘We had a lot in common. He sent me picture of himself and his daughters, family pictures, ordinary friends chat about things we found funny, both liked, etc,' patient A said. Their conversations soon became more intimate as the couple began to send sexually explicit messages by text and on MSN instant messenger. Their relationship became physical at the beginning of April 2012 and the couple met several times for sex, the hearing was told. Fiona Neale, defending Dr Brown, suggested to the patient: ‘He knew he was doing something that was reckless and wrong, but did it anyway and he made it plain to you throughout that the responsibility for that was his and in no way were you to blame for that situation.’ Patient A first told Dr Brown’s colleagues at the surgery there had been no sexual relationship and they were just friends. She even wrote a letter to the practice and encouraged her youngest daughter to do the same in an attempt to save Dr Brown’s career. But when Dr Brown told her he had resigned from the practice and was leaving the area to ‘try to save his marriage’, Patient A told his partners about the affair. She said: ‘Basically, my conscience was bothering me and I felt I had made a huge mistake in writing the letter to the surgery to say we had not had a relationship and felt that I should do the right thing. ‘He was not telling me not to do it, but he was telling me what the outcome would be if I did do it. He did tell me what he had said to the partners about the relationship previously. ‘I believe there were certain things in the letter [to the practice] that he had mentioned which I had not,’ said Patient A. ‘We both had three girls, we were both fans of Monty Python, basic things like that. Things he had told me.’ Dr Brown denies encouraging Patient A to include misleading information in a letter to Uplands and Mumbles Surgeries. Dr Brown has also admitted behaving dishonestly by asking Patient A to delete all correspondence between them, including texting her to say: ‘Make sure you delete them all because it’s how we got into bother.’ Dr Brown is currently subject to conditional registration, which restricts him to working for Swansea Out of Hours Service or the Singleton Hospital, in Swansea. He is not allowed to carry out face-to-face consultations with female patients unless there is a chaperone present. The hearing continues.

Lieutenant Colonel Robert Shaw shot himself dead after becoming overwhelmed by pressures of military life . A senior Army officer shot himself dead after becoming overwhelmed by pressures of military life, an inquest heard today. Lieutenant Colonel Robert Shaw, 52, was finding it increasingly difficult to manage his work as deputy commander of the Warminster Garrison in Wiltshire. The inquest heard evidence from other Army officers who spoke of how cuts to Col Shaw’s support staff increased his own workload. The married father-of-three was also due to retire from the Army in three years and was worried about his future career and paying his children’s school fees. The inquest at Gloucestershire Coroner’s Court also heard that Col Shaw believed he had relationship difficulties with his elderly mother and his own children. His wife, Angela, found him dead in his car on the morning of Sunday, June 2, this year in a secluded country lane at Quenington, near Cirencester, Gloucestershire. He last spoke to Mrs Shaw on the telephone at around 5pm the previous evening. He had left their home in Warminster that afternoon having told his wife he was going to an appointment at a gun shop in Cirencester to sell his weapons. When he failed to return home Mrs Shaw thought he had gone to see his elderly mother who lived in Fairford, Gloucestershire. On the Sunday morning Mrs Shaw drove to her mother-in-law’s home and when she saw that his car was not there went to look for him. She found her husband slumped in the front seat of his car with a gunshot wound to his chest and a rifle by his side. The inquest heard that Col Shaw also had a copy of the Bible on his lap and had written the word ‘sorry’ on the windscreen. Around a dozen notes were also found addressed to his family and friends, which he had left in his car and at home. Col . Shaw had also left his office at the Army base 'immaculate', leaving . all his paperwork in order and on a whiteboard had written an up to date . 'to do' list, which at the bottom he had again written 'sorry'. His mobile phone was also recovered from his office. In a written statement, Mrs Shaw said that from January this year he confided in her that things were getting on top of him. 'He was not his usual self and he started to obsess about small matters, which had become very serious to him,' she said. 'He had started a mild course of anti-depressants and he exhibited considerable anxiety over lots of things.' Major William Common (left) said Lieutenant Colonel Robert Shaw was given a too heavy workload at the inquest which was also attended by his wife Angela (right) Mrs Shaw said he was concerned the police would seize his legally-held firearms if they knew he had been taking anti-depressants. The inquest heard that Col Shaw, who held strong religious beliefs, had confided in an Army chaplain about his feelings and had also started seeing a therapist. Col Shaw, who had served in Bosnia and Kosovo, had been evacuated from the first Gulf War in 1991 suffering acute stress having exacerbated a pre-existing depression and spent time recuperating in hospital. The inquest heard evidence from Major William Common, who was critical of the workload placed upon Col Shaw. He said he had first met Col Shaw in July 2010 when he was posted to Warminster to take over from him as deputy commander. Lieutenant Colonel Robert Shaw was commander of the Warminster Garrison in Wiltshire . 'I worked reasonably closely with Robert Shaw who I found to be a thoroughly decent, approachable, genial, charming man,' Maj Common said. 'We spoke almost every day and on occasions would have wide-ranging discussions about life in general and family. 'I understood Robert Shaw to be a reasonably happy person but I was aware of difficulties with both his mother and mother-in-law, who appeared to be particularly demanding. 'It was clear to me that Robert found it difficult to meet the competing demands of his role as CO and deputy garrison commander. 'He always worked a full day and was often still in his office when I left yet he seemed to find it hard to programme routine activities like writing timely appraisal reports of his civilian and military staff. 'His grasp of the critical garrison-wide PFI contract, Project Allenby/Connaught, was never more than minimal.' Major Common added: 'Fundamentally Robert Shaw was a decent officer who I was proud to serve with but was of limited ability.' He said that the supporting staff posts were left vacant and the arrival of Colonel Peter Merriman as commander of Warminster Garrison in 2011 saw an increase in Col Shaw’s workload. Maj Common said Col Merriman was 'determined' to set up a new officers’ training course and build a new larger gymnasium. Maj Common said his last meeting with Col Shaw was on May 21 when he was shocked by his appearance. 'Robert was standing over his desk pouring over some papers. He looked tired and depressed and would neither meet my gaze or engage in conversation,' he said. 'I was shocked by his demeanour as in our three years he had always been open, friendly and welcome. He seemed to me to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown.' 'It was completely unfair and totally . unreasonable to expect Robert Shaw to provide unit level support . services, including meeting additional demands, without adequate staff' Major William Common . Maj Common said the thought that the post of deputy commander was not the right one for Col Shaw. 'I do not know why Robert Shaw took his own life. 'I do know that while a thoroughly decent man, he was an officer of limited ability, short staffed and under great pressure at work,' he said. 'He clearly found it extremely difficult to prioritise and to manage his time in the workplace without the added pressures of creating new training courses and building additional unplanned facilities. 'It was completely unfair and totally unreasonable to expect Robert Shaw to provide unit level support services, including meeting additional demands, without adequate staff.' The inquest also heard evidence from Rev Mark Haldon-Jones, an Army padre, who said that Col Shaw had described to him problems he felt he had in his relationship with his parents, in particular his mother. Acting Gloucestershire Coroner David Dooley summarised the padre’s evidence. He said: 'He had lost his deputy and there was an increased workload but even in those circumstances the padre confirms he behaved like a true gentleman and saw his service in Queen and country. A suicide verdict was given today at Lieutenant Shaw's inquest at Gloucestershire Coroner's Court . 'Robert was obviously a troubled soul and they often talked in biblical terms and Robert had started carrying a New Testament. 'The padre encouraged Robert to look to his family rather than the Army as he only had a few years left before his retirement. 'It appears Robert has requested to extend his stay at Warminster rather than move to a new posting and later regretted that but didn’t want to let people down who had supported him in his request to extend his stay.' Mr Dooley added: 'Robert was constantly using the phrase my loving little family and was clearly desiring to be a family man but felt he was not a good husband, father or son and this was reflected in a great reduction of his own self-esteem over this period. 'Lt Col Shaw confided in me on the Friday morning before his death by mobile phone and he seemed very calm and completely different from the manifestation of the previous months. 'Robert was standing over his desk . pouring over some papers. He looked tired and depressed and would . neither meet my gaze or engage in conversation' Major William Common . 'From his conversation and voice I genuinely believed he had moved on and he seemed more at ease with himself.' The inquest heard that Col Shaw had discussed with colleagues taking leave but had disclosed the nature of the problems he had. They noticed that there appeared to be deterioration in Col Shaw’s social interaction and he seemed to be pausing a lot and repeatedly going over same details. 'He was particularly distracted and he focused on issues that required less attention,' Major Lisa Phillips said in a statement. 'He seemed more preoccupied with his reputation than the issues concerning. He asked for several briefs on the same issues yet continued to ask every 10 to 15 minutes for updates as if he had not heard the information. 'He called me three times later that night to confirm the same details and I asked again if all was well and he responded ""We all have too much work to do"" and that was amidst several long silences.' Maj Phillips, who examined Col Shaw’s office following his death, added: 'His personal diary was empty and this level or organisation was unusual based on the time I have worked alongside him.'It felt impersonal and rationally organised.' Col Shaw, who had been married 20 years, had seen his GP and had been prescribed both sleeping tablets and anti-depressants. A post mortem examination found that Col Shaw had died from a single gunshot wound to the chest. Toxicology tests found traces of the medication he had been prescribed. No traces of alcohol or other non-prescribed drugs were found during the blood tests. Verdict: Suicide .","Lieutenant Colonel Robert Shaw was finding it difficult to manage his work .

Patients are routinely having to wait in agony for almost an hour before a nurse can administer pain relief. Senior nurses also say they are having to give advice to junior doctors because there are so few consultants on the wards. 'Unacceptable': The Royal College of Nursing says it is not safe to have just one registered nurse looking after a ward overnight . Figures show that at two hospitals – . Hemel Hempstead and Watford General, both part of West Hertfordshire NHS . trust – one nurse was left in charge of 22 elderly patients at night. At . Hinchingbrooke hospital in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, there was one . nurse for 21 patients while there was one for 16 patients at Colchester . hospital, in Essex. The . figures were obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by the Royal . College of Nursing. They emerged as the Government announced plans . yesterday for hospitals to publish the number of nurses working on each . ward. Patients will be able . to check the figures for their local hospital – as well as the . percentage of shifts that meet 'safe staffing' levels – on a new NHS . safety website from next June. The RCN says there should be at least one nurse for every eight patients, although there are no national guidelines. One registered nurse: Colchester General Hospital was one of the hospitals that had one registered nurse working . Karen . Webb, a member of the RCN's East of England branch, said nurses had . been ringing her in tears, distressed that they were unable to help . patients in pain. Miss Webb . said: 'We started to get calls from nurses very distressed, saying they . were doing shifts on their own. It's an unbearable emotional burden for . them if they cannot help patients – as nurses they want to be able to . care. 'Nurses cannot give . good, compassionate care or even check pain-killing medication in those . circumstances. It's just not safe and is completely unacceptable. 'The majority of patients in hospital are over 70 and they are often very dependent on help.' Rules . state that there must be two nurses present if a patient is being given . certain types of injection, including pain relief into their muscles or . veins. But if there is only . one nurse on a ward overnight, they would have to wait for a colleague . to come from a different area of the hospital before they can administer . treatment. This can mean patients are left waiting in pain for up to 45 minutes before the extra nurse arrives. Safe Staffing Alliance: The RCN is part of the Safe Staffing Alliance, which says there should be a minimum of one nurse caring for every eight patients . Trusts were not able to break down the Freedom of Information request results to explain whether the solitary member of staff on duty was on a full-time or temporary contract. The RCN is part of the Safe Staffing Alliance, which says there should be a minimum of one nurse caring for every eight patients. The figure is based on research from Southampton University, which found that hospitals with more than eight patients per registered nurse (during the day time on general acute wards) would see around 20 extra deaths a year than better staffed hospitals. The RCN said in a report: 'Anecdotally, we had heard from members and the public that registered nurses in some hospitals were looking after wards single-handedly with only a healthcare assistant in support. 'Nurses were also covering at night to support inexperienced junior doctors due to a shortage of senior medical supervision.' 'The survey shows that all hospitals were struggling to cover night shifts and relied on hundreds of temporary staff (bank and agency nursing staff plus locum doctors) to look after patients.' The RCN says on January 14, five hospitals had inpatient wards staffed by one registered nurse. 'This would result in delays for patients receiving pain relief and intravenous fluids.' The report continued, 'At best, the clinical outcomes for patients in these areas on the night surveyed should have been documented as a ""near miss clinical incident"".' Hinchingbrooke Hospital: The Cambridgeshire hospital was one of the five hospitals to have one nurse working on the chosen evening . A spokesman for Hinchingbrooke Hospital said they only had five patients in the ward on the night of the survey. He said: 'The report only looks at the number of beds in the ward, not the number of patients. 'At . the time in question, there were only five patients in the ward. We had . full cover from one full-time nurse and a health care assistant, which . is much higher than the recommended staffing cover.' A spokesman for Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust said: 'We are passionate about nursing and have made a huge commitment and investment to increase our nursing workforce during 2013 to care for higher numbers of patients and higher levels of sickness. 'We have increased the number of nursing posts and the number of nursing staff in post while at the same time reducing the number of vacancies. 'The trust has more nurses working evenings and weekends and we’ve also been recruiting more experienced, senior nurses so that there will be three Band 6 nurses working on each ward. 'We’re also currently implementing a recommendation of the Francis report which is to make all ward senior nurses ‘supervisory’ and recruiting more nurses to do the hands-on nursing work they currently carry out.' A spokeswoman for West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust said: ‘We are pleased to report that in May our Trust Board agreed to invest an additional £3.9 million per year to recruit 160 additional nurses to staff our inpatient wards, with temporary and agency nurses being employed (to fill the shortfall) whilst permanent staff were recruited. ‘Since June, we have offered jobs to 196 nurses (which covers the 160 additional nurses, as well as emerging vacancies, i.e. as other nurses retire or leave our hospitals).  60 of these nurses have already started. ‘We now review our ward staffing on a daily basis to ensure our levels are appropriate and will shortly start publishing them at our ward entrances.’ The health minister's reforms come in the wake of the Mid-Staffs scandal. He told MPs 'cruelty became the norm in the NHS and no-one noticed' and said his new measures, including publishing Ofsted-style ratings for hospitals, will give patients confidence in the health system. Officials suggest the new regime would prevent those such as Martin Yeates, the chief executive of Mid Staffordshire when up to 1,200 died needlessly, from ever running a trust again. Inquiry: Dorothy Simpson died at the Royal Bournemouth Hospital . A great-grandmother Dorothy Simpson died after calling her family from her hospital bed to say she couldn't breathe. Her son, Jim, rushed to her side at the Royal Bournemouth Hospital but when he arrived 20 minutes later she had died. The hospital's inquiry showed a catalogue of errors and said the 84-year-old should not have been left on her own 'at any stage'. It also said there was a 'delay in obtaining antibiotics in liquid form' and a reduced number of nurses on the ward at one point close to when she died. An investigation revealed failings in care and Chief Executive Tony Spotswood has now written to her family to say sorry. 'It is clear from our investigation that you and your family had a very poor experience whilst your mother was under our care, and for this I am extremely sorry,' he wrote. Mr Spotswood, admitted her son, Jim, 'found her alone, with the observation machine alarming and sadly it appeared that your mother had very recently passed away'. Mr Spotswood said there has since been a change in leadership on Ward 3 and a 'very experienced' ward sister has since been recruited.","Five hospitals had one nurse working overnight .

Specifically, Sandra Bullock’s underwear. He claims a more realistic depiction would have placed her in adult nappies. Scroll down for videos... Chris Hadfield saw Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity movie and he thought it was well done, but added that for it to be realistic Sandra Bullock should have worn diapers . ‘Inside our space suit, we’re wearing… a Halloween costume, which is a liquid cooling garment,’ Hadfield said on Conan O’Brien’s talk show. ‘And we’re wearing… kind of pull-up diapers. You come out and you’ve been sweating in there for eight hours, your hair looks like rat fur … you do not look like an underwear model.’ Hadfield added that the space walk in Gravity was ‘better than any space movie ever made’.

'In the early days of space exploration, food was mostly squeezed out of tubes,' said Hadfield in the video. Hadfield's video from the International space station reveals how astronauts create snacks in orbit. Here, he collects everything for a honey and peanut butter tortilla . 'But now, we have all kinds of things we eat on Earth.' In his book, An Astronaut’s Guide To Life On Earth by, he elaborates on day-to-day life in space. For instance, there’s no running water on the space station - you need gravity for that - so astronauts use wet wipes and no-rinse shampoo to wash themselves. They also sweat less, and clothes don’t cling to the skin in the same way, so don’t tend to smell as bad. ‘A pair of socks lasted me a week, a shirt was good for two weeks, and shorts and long pants could be worn for a month without unpleasant social consequences,’ he said.","Chris Hadfield said that in space no one looks like an underwear model .

Sunday night's episode, The Tower Of David, which saw the return of Nicholas Brody (Damien Lewis) averaged 1.81 million viewers for its 9pm episode - followed by a season best 2.62million for its three airings at 11pm and 1am on Monday. And this made it the Showtime drama's second-largest audience for any night, behind only its second-season finale, according to Nielsen. But despite the ratings, the TV hit has been castigated for its plotlines, which have so far seen errant CIA agent Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) forcibly detained in a psychiatric unit - while her former lover Sgt Nicholas Brody was discovered in Venezula, being kept in a prison of his own in an abandoned, half-finished skyscraper in Caracas, referred to as the Tower Of David. Why Dana? Homeland fans have taken their outrage for the teenage character's attitude and general mopiness online and have called for her to be killed off the show . Following Sunday's episode, stars including Rosie O'Donnell and actress Emily Deschanel took to Twitter to berate the show. Rosie, 51, tweeted: 'Homeland tonight...totally confused', while Bones star Emily, 37, added: 'You guys! What is going on with #homeland this season?!' Actress Olivia Wilde added: 'Homeland writers, how about we just have Carrie take her meds, take over the CIA, annihilate Dana, and solve puzzles all day?' Meanwhile, TV writer Michael Ausiello ‏said: 'Still not sure where I stand on last night's Homeland. I admired its quiet ambition but can't argue with folks who found it a little tedious.' Another tweeter, Jimmy Burns added: 'The #RedSox have temporarily lost big screen privileges so I can catch up on last week's #Homeland. I've traded one train wreck for another.' Favorable father: Dana is less beloved than her father Nicholas Brody, who is a terrorist . While another viewer Courtney Lee ‏tweeted: 'Catching up on Homeland! Carey is still crazy, Brody is still confusing and the episode is going nowhere! #ineedstufftohitthefanagain' The Twitter rampage comes after Homeland fans spoke of their fury for Brody's daughter Dana - and the big role she took in the second episode. As MailOnline reported last week, the moody . teen, played by Morgan Saylor, has been a subject of ridicule in fan message boards and online . ever since the show began two years ago, but her stock has gone down of . late since she has been granted so much screen time in the new season's . first two episodes. Adding . to the virtual vitriol about Dana's prominent plot lines is the fact . that her father was notably absent from the third season following the . explosive finale this spring. Rather . than just making Dana-esque scowls at their televisions, viewers took . to Twitter on Sunday night to lament once more their hatred of the . teenager who (spoiler alert) has recently come out of rehab following a . suicide attempt. 'Why is Dana still on the TV, WHY WHY WHY WHY,' Twitter user Jonathan McGarrigle wrote. 'I . thought that #homeland people would have realized by now nobody likes . dana, but no, they give her a storyline nobody cares about,' fellow user . @rapturebus wrote. Teenage angst: Actress Morgan Saylor, who plays Dana, said that she finds it funny how much time people dedicate to bashing her character online . The decision to include the Brody family prominently - while leaving viewers in the dark about the whereabouts of Nicholas Brody himself - was a conscious one for the creators. 'There are all these families that are the victims of somebody in the family doing an act of violence. Whether it’s Sandy Hook, whether it’s Columbine, the Boston Marathon bombers, these people all have families who suffer the consequences of these psychopathic actions,' show-runner Alex Ganza told New York Magazine. 'It was interesting to think about what would happen to the Brody family.' Screen time: The two episodes of season three of Homeland have dedicated a good portion of the episodes to Dana's story line and her new romantic interest . Actress Morgan Saylor, who plays the tortured teen, finds the attention paid to her character’s moods and ticks funny - including the spoof that Saturday Night Live did, where they played up her tendency to fiddle with her hands when feeling nervous. There are also similarities being drawn between Dana and the character of Skylar White from Breaking Bad, who was also the subject of scorn and the inspiration for hate-filled Facebook groups. ‘Characters are not always supposed to be loved. You could look at most characters and see mixed reactions. I don’t know. I don’t take it personally. I think it’s kind of interesting to see people, like, spending so much time focusing on something like that,’ Saylor said in an interview with The Daily Beast.","Third season has been widely criticized as 'confusing' and a 'train wreck'

A mother who lost her three daughters and elderly parents in a Christmas Day fire at her Connecticut mansion has revealed how she is slowly piecing her life back together - and is even engaged. Nearly two years since her unimaginable loss, Madonna Badger has written a piece for Vogue about how suicidal thoughts and a dark depression gave way to feelings of hope and understanding thanks to friends who took her in and life-changing charity work at an orphanage in Thailand. She has now returned to work in New York City and is looking forward to getting married next year to a long-time friend, who appeared by her hospital bed the day of the tragedy in 2011. 'It's never going to be easy,' she said of her loss. 'The pain . is just so huge that sometimes it feels like a prison cell. But trying . really hard to not feel sorry for myself makes me feel good.' Fighter: Madonna Badger, who lost her three daughters and parents to a Connecticut house fire on Christmas Day, 2011, beams with happiness as she is pictured with her fiance, William Duke . At first, Badger, 49, could never have imagined feeling such peace. She recounted the joy-filled Christmas Eve in 2011 with her daughters, nine-year-old Lily and seven-year-old twins, Sarah and Grace, and her parents, Pauline and Lomer Johnson. They were joined by her boyfriend of a month, Michael Borcina, who was the contractor on the Stamford home. But that night, unfathomable tragedy struck. She woke at 3am to a room filled with smoke and although she desperately tried to save her daughters, only she and Borcina survived. Authorities have said the home caught fire due to still-glowing fireplace embers that had been put in a mud room. Badger has expressed skepticism over this conclusion, insisting that she saw electrical sparks coming from the house as she clambered over scaffolding to reach her girls. Loss: Nine-year-old Lily, left, poses with her seven-year-old twin sisters, Sarah (center) and Grace (right) Missed: Madonna's parents, Lomer and Pauline Johnson, also lost their lives in the early-morning fire . She still replays the surreal evening over and over in her head, she wrote in Vogue. 'Even . today, I wake up most morning and I'm back there trying to figure out . how to save everybody, or thinking about what I could have done . differently,' she said. 'Why . didn't I climb into bed with my kids? Why didn't I check on them in the . night? Why didn't I smell the smoke? Why did I choose that house?' After . learning in hospital that her daughters and parents had all died in the . fire, the next thing she remembers is waking up surrounded by friends, . including now-fiance William Duke. Just . days later, she managed to attend the funeral of her children, sobbing . alongside her ex-husband and the father of her girls, Matthew Badger. But . just two days afterwards, with no funeral to organize or focus on, she . plunged into a deep depression and broke down, threatening to take a . bottle of pills, she recalled. Scene: The destroyed house in Stamford was immediately pulled down by the city . Survivors: Only Badger and her boyfriend of a month, contractor Michael Borcina, survived the fire. They are pictured at the children's funeral but Badger said their relationship had no hope . Devastated: Madonna cries on the shoulder of her ex-husband, Matthew Badger, at the funeral . She was committed to a psychiatric . hospital in New York and was not allowed to check herself out. There, . her story made therapists cry and she watched as patients went for electric shock therapy. Eventually . she was moved to a trauma-therapy center outside Nashville 'by which . time my hair was coming out in clumps,' she said. 'I don't remember . eating. At times I was manic; at other times, almost catatonically . depressed.' Desperate to . escape, in February 2013 she called her old college roommate, Kate Askew, in Little Rock, . Arkansas and asked to stay with her. Kate and her husband agreed - as . long as she promised not to kill herself. Badger promised. 'I . was lying through my teeth,' she said. 'At that point I was far closer . to killing myself than I was at any other point during the tragedy - I . felt sure it was my only option.' But . with her move to Arkansas, bit by bit, she began to feel some normalcy. She began daily therapy sessions, took up yoga and had acupuncture . treatments. She also began helping out a friend of . Kate's with her estate sales business, sorting through antiques and old . family belongings. Ripped apart: The girls are pictured with their father Matthew Badger, who was also invited to the house in Connecticut for Christmas but stayed in Manhattan instead. He has set up a fund in the girls' names . Carrying on: Madonna said she feels the children's memories would best be honored by continuing to live . She credits the work with saving her life - not only because it focused her energies, but also because looking at old photos of people who had long since passed helped her face the idea of loss. 'Little by little, I was getting my brain back online,' she said. Realizing that she was craving the type of work more suited to her - working for advertizing firm Jim Winters in New York - she decided to move back. But before that, she had to face Christmas again. She decided to go to an orphanage in Thailand and on Christmas Day, she gave the children toys that had previously belonged to her own daughters. 'I closed my eyes and when I opened . them we were all crying,' she said. 'When I looked into the girls' faces, I saw my children. It broke me open in a way I still can't fully . explain. 'But . if these little girls were living their lives with joy and happiness, I . realized - and if they could give their love to me after all they had . been through - how could I possibly feel sorry for myself?' She returned to work in New York and said the job had given her a 'deep comfort'. Staying strong: She has returned to work in New York City and plans to get married next September . On moving back to the city, she contacted Bill Duke, who lives and works as a real estate broker in Brooklyn, for help finding a new place to live. They had initially met years ago at Duke's grandparents' house in the East Hamptons when Badger briefly dated one of his brothers. Duke asked her out on a date - and now the couple are engaged. They are planning to wed next September and this Christmas, they will volunteer together, she said. She added of her loss: 'You can either be full of hate or full . of love - it can go either way. I have no hate in my heart, no . bitterness, and I am blessed by this. 'What better way to honor their lives than to not give . up?' The article by Madonna Badger features in the December issue of Vogue, which goes on sale on November 19. Matthew Badger set up the Lily Sarah Grace Fund in the girls' memories.

"The presenter has claimed taking certain vitamins make it 'impossible' to get cancer and that 'AIDS is a hoax' By . Associated Press . UPDATED: . 18:44 EST, 14 August 2013 . A federal judge has found author and . infomercial pitchman Kevin Trudeau in contempt of court for failing to . pay a more than $37 million fine imposed over misleading ads for one of . his wildly popular weight-loss books. The . Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has been after 50-year-old Trudeau, . originally from Massachusetts, for several years after he made millions flogging what he claims are natural cures for serious and potentially fatal illnesses. The . ruling at the end of last month was the latest round in more than a . decade of legal battles that began with a suit filed by the Federal . Trade Commission. Failure: Infomercial king Kevin Trudeau has been held in contempt of court for failing to pay $38million for defrauding customers with his natural cures . Trudeau was slapped with a $38 million fine in 2011 after allegedly scamming customers for decades. The FTC said that he has made millions of dollars by telling followers that coral calcium can cure cancer among other claims. FTC put the value at $37.6million as to . how much consumers were defrauded by 'deceptive infomercials' that . Trudeau filmed in order to plug his book - The Weight Loss Cure 'They' Don't Want You to Know About. In 2007, Judge Robert Gettleman fined Trudeau $37.6 million for violating the order. The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's decision that Trudeau must pay the huge fine. On July 26 of this year, Gettleman said Trudeau failed to pay and ordered him to transfer ownership of companies and financial accounts to a court-appointed receiver. Gettleman found him in contempt, opting not to give him jail time out of concern that those hurt by his actions would never get compensated. Best-seller: Millions of people bought Trudeau's book which claimed that calcium could cure cancer and a product called Biotape would relieve severe pain . He likened Trudeau to a puppet master in control of a vast network being used to keep his assets hidden and suggested that without his cooperation there would be no way to get at that money. Despite no formal medical training and several criminal convictions, Trudeau has sold millions of books offering cures for dozens of ailments, from faltering memory to hair loss. Kevin Trudeau made late-night infomercials for more that 20 years. Doctors have expressed concern in the past about his book Natural Cures They Don't Want You To Know About which has sold more than five million copies and appeared at the top of non-fiction bestseller lists. His claims include: 'The sun does not cause cancer. Sun block has been shown to cause cancer.' Another one of his statements is that Aids is 'one of the greatest hoaxes and deceptions ever perpetrated on the American public'. The FTC first came after Trudeau in 1998 for making false claims on TV. He claimed his alternative medicines could cause dramatic weight loss and cure addictions to alcohol, cigarettes and heroin. He even said the herbal remedies could give users a photographic memory. More than 25 million Americans have purchased products from Trudeau. On one episode of his radio show The Kevin Trudeau Show, he said: 'Coral calcium is the best form of calcium.' He then tells his listeners: 'Every single one of you are deficient in vitamin D3 and calcium. 'If you take those two things, it's virtually impossible to get cancer and it's impossible to get sick.' They have titles such as The Weight Loss Cure 'They' Don't Want You to Know About, the book at the center of his latest legal trouble. The FTC first sued Trudeau in 1998, charging that he made false and unsubstantiated claims in infomercials for hair growth, memory and weight-loss products. In 2003, the agency sued Trudeau for deceptively marketing a calcium product as a cancer cure and a product called Biotape as a pain reliever. Trudeau paid $2 million in 2004 to settle the FTC's charges and agreed to comply with a court order banning him from infomercials except those that accurately promote books. Three years later, the judge held Trudeau in civil contempt for misrepresenting some of the facts in an ad for his best-selling weight-loss book, namely that the diet plan was easy and allowed adherents to eat anything they wanted. After purchasing the book, however, the FTC alleged that consumers discover it 'requires severe dieting,' daily injections of a prescription drug not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for weight loss and 'lifelong dietary restrictions'. Trudeau's attorney, Kimball Anderson, said last month that his client wants to cooperate but does not own the companies and does not have the money. Tactics: Kevin Trudeau's methods were found to be dubious by the Federal Trade Commission in 2007 .",The presenter has claimed taking certain vitamins make it 'impossible' to get cancer and that 'AIDS is a hoax'
"By . Rebecca English . PUBLISHED: . 22:47 EST, 12 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:24 EST, 13 November 2013 . Impassioned plea: Prince Charles at the . Vazhachal Forest Range. He has written in Country Life of the challenges . facing farming communities . Prince Charles has issued an impassioned plea to save a  British countryside which is ‘as precious as any cathedral’. In an editorial in Country Life magazine, written to mark his 65th birthday, the future king says the  British countryside is the ‘backbone’ of our national identity. He also writes at length about the challenges facing farming communities, his frustration at estimates that 40 per cent of the food produced in the world goes to waste and even accuses supermarkets of exploiting small farmers. Charles says: ‘I find it fascinating to watch how dramatically the landscape changes and how those changes affect the character of people, making the British countryside the unacknowledged backbone of our national identity. 'It is as precious as any of our great cathedrals and we erode it at our peril.’ Charles, who becomes a pensioner tomorrow, agreed to guest edit the 116-year-old magazine to mark the occasion. He uses his editorial to talk about the importance of rural communities and the fact that they are facing some of their ‘toughest challenges’, with farmers often earning just £8,000 to £12,000 a year. He said: ‘It concerns me greatly that the average age of a British farmer is currently 58, and that a recent survey by the Royal Agricultural Society of England suggested we will need 60,000 new farmers in the next decade. I fear it is a target we will not meet. ‘Farming, of course, is much more than just a job. It is a way of life and most farmers accept that they will not earn as much as they would elsewhere. ‘This does not mean they should be penalised for choosing such a vital profession, and yet small farmers find themselves in the iniquitous position of taking the biggest risk, often acting as the buffer for the retailer and consumer against all the economic uncertainties of producing food, but receiving the least return. 'It cannot be right that a typical hill farmer earns just £12,600, with some surviving on as little as £8,000 a year, while the big retailers and their shareholders do so much better out of the deal, having taken none of the risk. This has far-reaching consequences. ‘Such is the squeeze on farm incomes that many small and medium-sized farms, and not just in the uplands, cannot afford to make crucial long-term reinvestment, and I fear this will create huge problems in the near future, especially in the dairy sector.’ He added: ‘Farmers have taken a battering in recent years.’ Charles’s suggestion that ‘big . retailers’ are making money on the back of hard-pressed farmers will . undoubtedly have resonance with many. Indeed, . it is not the first time that he has hit out at the ‘bully’ supermarkets for what he believes is the poor deal they give British . farmers. Special edition: The front cover of this week's Country Life features a picture of Charles taken at his Balmoral estate, while the frontispiece features a picture of his wife Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall . The prince greets an Indian security officer . during his tour: In an editorial written to mark his 65th birthday in .

Leading the way: Charles uses uses his editorial . to talk about the importance of rural communities and the fact that . they are facing some of their 'toughest challenges', with farmers often . earning as little as £8,000 a year . Critics, however, are sure to point out the irony of his words after Charles handed over his then loss-making Duchy of Cornwall food brand to national chain Waitrose in 2009. The firm has added dozens of new lines and remarketed the brand, although a significant proportion of the profits still goes to charity. The prince himself is also one of the . largest landowners in the country through the Duchy of Cornwall, which . has 53,154 hectares of land in 24 counties, most in the south west of . England. Prince Charles shares a light moment with conservationists Belinda Wright and Mark Shand: He was said to be disappointed after the dozens of police officers accompanying him scared off the elephants in the area . The prince also . highlights what he sees as the huge levels of food waste that go on in . the world, citing the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation which . estimates that roughly 40 per cent of food produced is thrown away. Prince Charles yesterday unwisely chose to wear suede shoes for a trip to a rain-drenched jungle during his official tour of India with his wife. He was taken to see an ‘elephant corridor’ to learn more about work to save the dwindling Asian breed, but was left disappointed after the dozens of police officers accompanying him scared off everything but the local leeches. ‘On every other occasion in my life that I’ve gone to these things it’s the same - it’s the security that ruins everything,’ he said with undisguised irritation and mud-caked shoes. He describes British farmers as ‘some of the best in the world’ but warns that as a nation we ‘cannot go on taking as we do from the Earth without giving something back’. The prince also highlights the loss of rare and ancient breeds of farm animals, dismissing critics who claim he simply has ‘some sort of romantic attachment to a bygone age.’ ‘My reasons are rooted in hard-nosed science and face the future. The preservation of these breeds and the characteristics in their genes could be crucial to our ability to farm sustainably,’ he says. Farmers and farming, he concludes, are the ‘bedrock of our rural communities’. ‘This is why the countryside’s contribution to the national good has to be cherished and sustained. Without it, we will all be very much the poorer,’ he writes. Marl Hedges, editor of Country Life magazine, said of the piece: ‘This essay reveals his unconditional passion for the British countryside and demonstrates a deep knowledge built up over many years.’","Charles issued warning over countryside's future in Country Life editorial .

A female Air Force veteran has revealed horrifying scars and a catalog of ill health following what she claims was a botched removal of her ovaries allegedly performed by a Veteran's Affairs surgeon. Robin Temple posted a video online earlier this month with her abdominal and chest scars exposed to show the terrible ordeal she has been through following 13 surgeries in six years. On the clip, Ms Temple says: 'Hi, my name's Robin Temple and I'm an Air Force veteran and a malpractice survivor from the VA.' Ms Temple had a ovariectomy in January 2007 which she claims was performed by a VA OBGYN surgeon. However something went catastrophically wrong and a piece of her colon was removed instead. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT - SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Veteran Robin Temple has been left with horrifying scars and long-term ill health following a botched operation allegedly performed by a VA surgeon . For three days, Ms Temple claims she was told by the doctor's office that because she has PTSD, her pain following the surgery 'was all in [her] head'. Ms Temple later became septic and spent time in a coma on life-support. A follow-up doctor then performed a colectomy to correct the first doctor's mistake. For 15 months, she traveled several hundred miles to reach the hospital from her home in Maine to attend follow-up appointments because the pain continued. At one appointment, Ms Temple claims a doctor lifted her shirt in the waiting room and said: 'You're sewed together funny, get over it, you have PTSD.' Ms Temple's voice trembles on her YouTube clip as she says she was repeatedly told that she was exaggerating her health problems because she was suffering from PTSD. Later, the Air Force vet discovered she was suffering from two massive hernias and while undergoing an MRI scan to investigate, found that her ovaries had not been removed. Tragically, the tumors had spread to her lymph nodes in her groin. More surgeries took place. Ms Temple, who served with the U.S. Air Force pictured in hospital during one of her many operations since 2007 . Ordeal: Ms Temple's scars from one of her 13 surgeries . She then had bladder sheaths implanted which cut her bladder in half and were recalled, leading to more surgery. Because she is allergic to penicillin, . the alternative tetracycline has caused the discoloration of her teeth, Ms Temple claims. Her left kidney began to fail due to the amount of medication Ms Temple required and ongoing infections. She lost half of her left kidney. Ms Temple had a double mastectomy after discovering a lump in her breast and finally, her lymph nodes removed. Ms Temple told heavy.com: 'I am a jigsaw puzzle. 'I have had 13 surgeries since '07 and counting. I have two more hernias now. 'The only thing holding my guts in is cadaver skin; that's it, and it only last three to five years. 'I'm at the fifth year this January... and where do I live?... I lost my house so I live in a tiny little camper.' She claims that the government has not taken any responsibility for her botched medical care and instead she is left to fill out paperwork on a daily basis. Ms Temple does appear to be mistaken in some of her statements, according to Gawker, including the accusations against one doctor and remarks about 'illegal' overdoses. She also falsely claims that a pencillin allergy stained her teeth and her statistics about the number of women raped in the military are incorrect. Fundraising campaigns have been set up for the veteran after her story was shared across social media sites. One Reddit user wrote: 'This poor woman. She's sitting in her bed right now, as we are watching this. We're . going to go about our days, and she's still going to be there. Waiting. I . hope this gets a lot of attention. Seems like she's been ignored a long . time.' Ms Temple also claims that while she was on active duty in the Air Force, she was raped by her sergeant but no one would believe her and she was placed in a mental hospital. She was honorably discharged from service. MailOnline was awaiting a response from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.","Robin Temple, from Maine, has had 13 surgeries since 2007 following what she claims was a botched attempt to remove her ovaries ."

America's mega-rich just keep getting richer - but Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates . remains on top, taking number one spot on Forbes' wealth list for the . 20th straight year with $72 billion. Forbes released its annual list of the richest Americans on Monday. The 400 people on the rankings posted a joint net worth of $2 . trillion, up from $1.7 trillion a year ago. That marks their highest . combined value ever and this astounding figure further outlines the growing gap between the exceptionally wealthy and the rest of the country. While most of the names and rankings didn't change from a year ago, the majority of members of the elite club saw their fortunes grow over the past year, helped by strong stock and real estate markets. All smiles: Bill Gates is the richest man in the U.S. for the 20th year running, with a net worth of $72 billion . Spare change: Wal-Mart heir Christie Walton (left) was the highest woman on the rich list at number six, with a net worth of $35.4 billion . 'Basically, the mega rich are mega richer,' said Forbes Senior Editor Kerry Dolan. Dolan noted that list's minimum net income increased to a pre-financial crisis level of $1.3 billion, up from $1.1 billion in 2012, with 61 American billionaires not making the cut. 'In some ways, it's harder to get on the list than it ever has been,' she said. Gates remains America's richest man, taking the top spot on the list for the 20th straight year, with a net worth of $72 billion, up from $66 billion a year ago. Investor Warren Buffett, the head of Berkshire Hathaway, posted another distant second place finish with $58.5 billion, but increased his net worth from $46 billion. Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison stayed . third with $41 billion and was the only member of the top 10 whose net . worth was unchanged from a year ago. Runners-up: Warren Buffett (left) and Larry Ellison (right) were second and third. Buffett is worth $58.5 billion while Ellison has $41 billion in the bank . Brothers . Charles and David Koch, co-owners of Koch Industries, stay tied . for fourth with $36 billion each, up from $31 billion in 2012. Wal-Mart heirs Christy Walton, Jim . Walton, Alice Walton and S.

According . to a study of Internal Revenue Service figures released last week, the . top 1 percent of U.S. earners collected 19.3 percent of household income . in 2012, their largest share in IRS figures going back a century.

A police force under the spotlight over its handling of child sex exploitation is still prioritising burglary and vehicle crime, according to a new report. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) found that the emphasis from senior and middle local managers at South Yorkshire Police was still more focused on dealing with other crimes and must act immediately to improve its response. It also found that intelligence teams were not fully supporting child sexual exploitation investigations and that staffing problems were hampering the investigations. It said that these matters should be addressed 'as a matter of urgency'. South . Yorkshire PCC Shaun Wright said there had been ‘a failure of . management’ at South Yorkshire Police as he responded to the report, . which he commissioned in the summer. The . HMIC inspection report did say, however, that South Yorkshire Police . now showed a ‘clear commitment to enhancing the force's response to the . sexual exploitation of children’ and found ‘all the officers and staff . working in child protection to be deeply committed to their work’. But the inspectors also said these efforts have had ‘mixed success’. Their . report concluded: ‘In particular, although staff and officers were . aware that tackling child sexual exploitation was a stated force . priority, this has not consistently been translated into operational . activity on the ground at a local (district) level.’ Mr Wright said: ‘This current situation has to change. Police on patrol in Rotherham, which was at the centre of a major child sex exploitation case in 2010 (file photo) where five men were jailed after being found guilty of grooming teenage girls . ‘The report makes a number of . recommendations, with the most urgent to be implemented immediately and . others within three and six months.

'However, there is clearly a failure of management to . turn my, and the public of South Yorkshire's, key strategic priority . into operational effectiveness uniformly across the whole force area.’ South .

The prosecution in Rotherham (pictured) was the first of a series of high profile cases in the last three years. A report by The Times claimed police and child protection agencies had known about the activities for a decade . The spotlight first fell on the town in 2010 when five men, described by a judge as 'sexual predators’, were given lengthy jail terms after they were found guilty of grooming teenage girls for sex. The prosecution was the first of a series of high-profile cases in the last three years that have revealed the exploitation of young girls in towns and cities including Rochdale, Derby and Oxford. Following the 2010 case, The Times claimed that details from 200 restricted-access documents showed how police and child protection agencies in the South Yorkshire town had extensive knowledge of these activities for a decade, yet a string of offences went unprosecuted. The allegations led to a range of official investigations, including one by the Home Affairs Select Committee. Earlier this year, The Times published fresh claims that a teenager in the care of social services was allowed extensive contact with a violent adult offender who was suspected of grooming young girls to use and sell for sex. At the same time, a South Yorkshire law firm announced that it was working on behalf of four women who want to take legal action against Rotherham Council in relation to sexual exploitation when they were teenagers.","In 2010 five men in Rotherham were found guilty of grooming .

In a new two-part documentary, Rise of Animals: Triumph of the vertebrates, the naturalist explores the origins of the backbone by studying a tiny prehistoric animal and a living fossil living in the south of England. Sir David takes a 500-million-year evolutionary journey to study animals including a newly discovered ‘missing link’ from China, a shallow water predator that swam like a fish but took its first steps on land, giant ancient animals and the famous fossil of the feathered dinosaur. Scroll down for exclusive video . Sir David sets out to investigate how vertebrates managed to step out of the water for the first time and his search takes him to see fossils in the Canadian Arctic, revealing an amazing creature called Tiktaalik (a CGI image is pictured) Sir David looks at the story of mammals in the Lufeng Basin of Southern China where he examines a tiny 195-million-year-old fossil of a Hadrocodium skull measuring just one centimeter belonging to one of earliest mammals discovered. A mocked-up skeleton of a Hadrocodium is pictured . The series, which will air at 9pm tonight on BBC 2, uses CGI animation to bring long-dead creatures to life and tells the story of how a wide array of animals, including fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals came to flourish. It sees Sir David filming for the first time in China, where he sees the fossils that are changing the face of palaeontology, as well as travelling to remote locations across the globe to unravel the mysterious origins of vertebrates, chart their unexpected journey out of the water and reveal the rise of mammals. He said: 'China . has discovered rare fossils which it takes very seriously that have not . yet been fully explored by the Western world.

'Having visited China 30 . years ago, I wanted to return and film there to find out more about the . amazing discoveries scientists have been making there over recent . decades.' Sir David was given special access to this treasure trove of new fossil evidence in China, which he uses to answer questions such as where do fingers and toes come from and why are we warm-blooded? The programme explores the origins of verebrates by looking at primitive fish, which sees Sir David joining an excavation team in the Chinese province of Yunnan to unearth creatures entombed in an ancient seabed 525 million years ago. The site is considered one of the most . significant discoveries of the 20th century because the creatures . fossilised there have filled key gaps in the . evolutionary tale and Sir David reveals the origin of the backbone in the paperclip-sized ancient fish called Myllokunmingia.

'I’ll show what . it is that sets us apart from other animals and makes us especially . able animals.' The . first episode of David Attenborough's two-part documentary, Rise of . Animals: Triumph of the vertebrates, airs tonight at 9pm on BBC 2 . Myllokunmingia: The first known common ancestor of all vertebrates. Using its early back-bone to move around in a totally new way, this animal diversified over millions of years to create the spectacular variety of backboned creatures we see on our planet today. Parayunnanolepis: A newly identified ‘missing link’ from China; older fish have front fins but this one has another pair of back fins, or pelvic fins, granting much more swimming stability to the owner. Along with the jaw, sharks and skates benefited greatly from this crucial innovation. Tiktaalik: An ancient shallow water predator which is the very first vertebrate that could move its head independently of its shoulders. In deep water it swam like any other fish, but in the shallows it used its big muscles, robust bones and jointed fin to punt around. This key evolutionary step became the driving force behind one of the most spectacular events in evolutionary history: the arrival of vertebrates on land. Lufengosaurus: Studier legs joints and stronger hips compared to their splayed out ancestors meant dinosaurs like Lufengosaurus could take longer strides and support heavier bodies. Lufengosaurus were able to support the entire weight of the body on the hind legs, like we can today. Hadrocodium: This is the earliest mammal fossil we know of which makes it the ancestor of all mammals alive today. This creature had a new innovation of warm-bloodedness, heightened senses powered by a growing brain which enabled it and the early mammals to operate in the dark. Juramania: This small mammal is the first creature we know of that nurtured its young inside its body, in a womb. It is therefore part of the mammal group that we belong too, the placentals. The placental system evolved in Juramania about 160 million years ago. Titanothere: One of the first ‘megafauna’ they started out as small creatures but evolved to be true giants, standing about 2 and a half metres tall. Their skulls were massive with bony protrusions that were used for combat and defensive from predators.

"By . Bonnie Estridge . PUBLISHED: . 17:10 EST, 16 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:33 EST, 16 October 2013 . Well, what do we have here, staring at me from the bathroom mirror? Is that a frown line I see? I think it is, quite a deep one, and there are crow's feet too, two sets, fanning out below my eyes, not quite joining but certainly creeping their way towards the creases coursing from my nose to my mouth. I shouldn't be surprised. After all, what woman reaches the age of 62 without time carving its initials and experiences into her face? But for me this is all new because, for best part of two decades, I've been shielded from the effects of ageing, as I have worshipped every six months at the shrine of my beloved Botox. We go back a long, long, way - dear old Botox and me. I was a Botox guinea pig, one of the first people to try the controversial injection in the UK for cosmetic purposes, and I've been hooked for two decades. Going natural: Bonnie aged 60, left,  just before giving up Botox and aged 62, right, after two years without it . The joy of having smooth skin and wrinkles without having to undergo a Joan Rivers wind-tunnel style facelift was fantastic. I thought I'd found the holy grail of anti-ageing and swore to use it for the rest of my life. But as my 60th birthday loomed, my letter reminding me to book my Harley Street appointment arrived, I hesitated before ringing. Why? Botox may be brilliant at halting the march of time, but it can't hold back inflation: when I first had the treatment, back in 1993, it was £200. Now it's closer to £400. It's still cheaper than a facelift but when you've had it as often as me, only just. But my hesitation wasn't just down to money. Not only have I grown older, I've finally grown up. As a 40-year-old surveying my first wrinkles with horror, I'd always assumed that my need to conceal them would increase over the passing years. But I've actually discovered the opposite. I found myself staring in the mirror and wondered for the first time why I was continuing to use Botox. It's not as if I'm a newsreader, competing with ever younger auto-cuties. When I walk past building sites, workmen no longer whistle - with or without Botox. And my husband loves me both with and without make-up - he can rarely tell the difference. Halting march of time: Bonnie ten years ago when she was a Botox devotee . I've realised it’s finally time to stop worrying about looking ten years younger and accept that, with a decent frock, a slick of lipstick and a pair of heels, I still scrub up pretty well. I'm actually using less make-up, and ask what's wrong with looking like an attractive, well-preserved 62-year-old woman when that's exactly what I am? I confess, however, I did recently have that horrible experience of glancing in a shop window and not recognising the old dear staring back  at me. But surely it's far worse to be one of those deluded women who are so used to their scary, frozen faces that they don't notice themselves slipping into the 'weird and slightly deformed' category. And, to add insult to injury, they no longer look any younger than their contemporaries. Singer Lulu recently admitted she stopped using Botox for that very reason, because it stopped making her look youthful. Felicity Kendal gave it up because she said, at 66, it was simply undignified. And I couldn't agree more. As I approach 63, I'm finally starting to feel happy in my own, wrinkled skin. I don't want to compete any more, or feel the need to fake my looks. And besides which, we still don't really know what the health risks of Botox are over long-term, regular use. Among younger women the popularity of Botox marches on, unchecked: in a recent survey, cosmetic surgeons reported an 18 per cent increase in demand for injections - especially among women their 30s and 40s. In a recent survey, cosmetic surgeons . reported an 18 per cent increase in demand for injections - especially . among women their 30s and 40s . This very website reported the rise of the 'mummy makeover' - the stampede of school mums to cosmetic clinics before the start of term to make sure they look as young and smooth as the other mothers at the schoolgates. And I do sympathise with them. I was in my late 30s, with young, school-age children, when that deep furrow first appeared between my eyebrows. My husband kept asking me what was wrong and workmen would shout: 'Cheer up love, it may never happen.' Friends said I seemed permanently stressed. Even though I felt fine, I really did look like Mrs Angry all the time. But what could I do? Then something wonderful happened. I was sent to interview a Harley Street cosmetic surgeon about a drug that was brand new to the UK. I read, fascinated, about this thing called Botox which had been injected into patients with involuntary facial tics and spasms. Quitters: Lulu, left, said she's given up on Botox as it has stopped making her look younger while Felicity Kendal gave it up because she said, at 66, it was simply undignified . I learned how it was discovered that one of the side-effects of paralysing the over-active, twitching muscles was that the patient's wrinkles vanished too. How fantastic, I thought. I pointed out my frown line (which hardly needed pointing out) to the surgeon and asked if I could try it. I was slightly perturbed at the thought of having a drug injected into me that was derived from poisonous botulism bacteria, however diluted and mild, but the effects were miraculous. My horrid little furrow vanished, along with some forehead lines, and my brow seemed to have lifted, leaving me looking wide eyed and fresh - as if I’d just come back from a long holiday. The surgeon warned me that it wasn't permanent and I'd need regular treatments. That was no problem. To me, it was a tiny price to pay for looking and feeling so great, even though I am a bit of a coward and the injections stung, despite liberal amounts of anaesthetic cream. Now I'm happy to display my battle scars, and I'll be saving myself a great deal of time and money in the process . Over the years, I kept up my regular appointments. Those little jabs took me through the highs and lows and stresses of life that cause your skin to sag and plough deep worry lines. I think I even dealt with life a bit better because of them - knowing I looked good made me feel more confident and more in control of everything. And of course, I wasn't the only one to catch on to the benefits of Botox. The news of this miraculous little treatment spread like wildfire, and this was in the days before the internet. Suddenly Botox was everywhere. The genie was out of the bottle and anyone who was anyone had to have it. There were Botox parties in private homes where women sat chatting with layers of anaesthetic cream or post-injection ice packs on their foreheads as the cheese dip and Chardonnay were passed round. In demand: But we still don't really know what the health risks of Botox are over long-term, regular use . Celebrities seemed addicted to it, and the immobile faces of Madonna, Nicole Kidman, Kylie Minogue and Sharon Osbourne peered out at us from magazines and TV. Age of the jab . When Botox was first introduced as an anti-ageing treatment, the average age of the user was 41 . And where previously it had been de rigueur to flatly deny any helping hand you'd had with your looks, Botox was so cool, A-listers were actually admitting they’d had it. And still the party continues. Botox has just had its 25th UK anniversary and is still the top anti-ageing product, even among the ever-growing range of miracle creams, fillers and bizarre freezing treatments. But not for me. Botox and I have parted company for good. It's been two years since my last jab and new lines are appearing every day. I've even got lines on my lines! But the difference is that now I'm happy to display my battle scars, and I'll be saving myself a great deal of time and money in the process. I've had all the ups and downs of marriage, two children and a career - and I’m not afraid to show it. Sometimes when I see my two daughters scowling I don't just give them my own mother's folklore waffle - the wind will change and your face will stay like that - I simply say stop frowning or start saving for your Botox. But for me it's bye bye Botox. It's been great, but now I'm happy to frown.","Bonnie started having the anti-ageing jabs 20 years ago .

While University students are often stereotyped as bookworms with no common sense, new research has shown that they are actually picking up vital life skills while studying. Among them are the ability to turn on a grill, how to set up the internet, and how to budget. The list does little to undermine stereotypes however, as playing pub games, blagging essays and the effectiveness of napping all come high up. Other strange pieces of wisdom picked up between library sessions include the fact that fridges don't clean themselves, and why it is a bad idea to eat mould. A list of the top 50 'life skills' gained while at Uni has been published, revealing that students learn how to study all night and survive three days without sleep . A spokeswoman for Disney, which conducted the research to mark the release of Disney Pixar's Monsters University, said: 'No matter which walk of life you come from, it would seem that university is a great leveller. 'Learning day to day basics such as budgeting, how to book a doctor's appointment and using a washing machine along with finding out who you are and want to become is integral to the whole university experience. 'There's definitely a valuable alternative curriculum at Uni with some of it more fun than others. While some practical skills were picked up, such as basic DIY and how to tune a television, the benefits of napping were also in the top 50 . 'Not only does our research confirm this but it also reveals this is not particular to just today's generation of university students it also applies to previous generations.' Two thirds of students said that the experience of moving away from home had been a 'real eye opener' with nearly half saying that they were shocked by how little they knew when mum and dad were no longer around. In fact new students called home on average 20 times a month to check how to do things, though that lessened as time went on. Luckily for parents, however, those surveyed also said they only really started to appreciate home after they had gone. It took people four months to feel settled in their new accomodation, with five months passing before they knew who their friends were going to be. Among the hardest challenges were learning to live with strangers, making new friends, and mixing with people from different backgrounds.","A list of the top 50 'life skills' gained at Uni has been published .

Chart hits are increasingly glamorising alcohol and could be driving children to drink, researchers have warned. Almost one in five songs in modern top tens contains a reference to booze – twice as many as ten years ago and almost three times as many as 30 years ago. The study also found that today’s music is more likely to glorify drinking than songs of the previous decade. Recent number ones referring to  alcohol include Rihanna’s Cheers and Kesha’s Tik Tok. Since 2001, lyrics about alcohol have more than doubled, according to Liverpool's John Hopkins University. Researchers fear it glamourises drinking to children. One in five songs in the UK charts was found to make references to alcohol, while children and teens were found to spend two hours a day listening to these songs . With former studies showing that exposure to alcohol marketing raises the odds that under-16s will start to drink, the researchers described their findings as a ‘major concern’. The research team at Liverpool John Moores University counted mentions of alcohol in songs that reached the UK top ten in 1981, 1991, 2001 and 2011. Songs that specifically mentioned drunkenness were also noted. The proportion of hits featuring alcohol rose from 5.8 per cent in 1981 to 18.5 per cent in 2011. And by 2011, one in eight songs referred to heavy drinking. The number of references was lowest in 1991, at 2.1 per cent. The researchers say this could be due to the rise of rave culture – linked more to the drug Ecstasy than alcohol. By the bottle: Rihanna tweeted this photo of herself . A selection of lyrics from popular songs that glorify drinking . The study attributes the rise of alcohol-related lyrics to an increase in the amount of U.S songs becoming popular in the UK. It uses Katy Perry's Last Friday Night, a still from the music video pictured, as an example and claims the song links drinking to confidence and success . The analysis, published in the Journal of Music Psychology, found mentions of drink to be most common in tracks  from the US and in R&B, rap and hip-hop genres. By 2011, the proportion of songs that glamorised alcohol by linking it to confidence, sociability or good looks clearly outweighed those that blamed it for hangovers and health problems. Similar studies have been done in the US but this is the first to look at British charts. Researcher Professor Karen Hughes said that the hidden advertising could encourage youngsters to start drinking or lead those who already drink to consume more. She said parents should be aware of the content of songs their children listen to. The study looked into chart history. Songs in 1981 contained relatively few references to alcohol, with the number declining further in 1991. Yet by 2001 they featured in 8% of hits. This figure continued to climb, more than doubling by 2011 18.5 per cent of the top 10 songs featuring alcohol-related lyrics . Professor Hughes added that although . lyrics cannot be censored, it may be possible to warn about references . to alcohol on labels that point out sexually explicit and violent . lyrics. The research concluded: ‘Health and other professionals . should recognise increased alcohol promotion in popular music and ensure . this does not reinforce the binge drinking culture or contribute to the . already high burdens of alcohol on young people.’ Earlier this week . it emerged that 6,580 youngsters aged 18 or under were admitted to . hospital with alcohol-related problems – some younger than 11. Emily . Robinson, of Alcohol Concern, said young people ‘over-estimate how much . their peers drink’ because advertising for it is ‘simply everywhere’.","One in five songs in the UK top ten found to contain references to alcohol .

The beauty properties of snail slime were discovered by Chilean workers exporting snails to France who noticed their hands healed quickly . The notion of having snail slime all over your face isn’t terribly appealing, so it just goes to show what a hint of celebrity interest can do for an unconventional beauty treatment. Sales of a new face cream containing the slime have almost tripled in the UK in just two months. Earlier this year, friends of 34-year-old Katie Holmes, ex-wife of Tom Cruise, said she used just such a product. Health food chain Holland and Barrett began stocking a version of the cream in 50 stores in June and then in all 700 of its branches a month ago. In that time sales have risen 189 per cent. Snail Gel, which costs £19.99 for a 50ml pot, contains mucus secreted by the snails which is said to regenerate and repair the skin. Its arrival follows that of snail slime facials. They involve having specially farmed creatures slither up and down your face and were launched at a beauty salon in Britain last month. The £50 treatment was added to the menu at Simply Divine salon in Corby, Northamptonshire, having been pioneered in Japan. Owner Diane Gower claims clients have been overwhelmed by the results. By using the cream, women can see if the slime works for them without going to a salon. The face cream is not the only snail-based beauty product on sale in the UK after one British salon started offering snail facials last month . It is said to contain a cocktail of proteins, antioxidants and hyaluronic acid which removes dead cells, reduces inflammation and helps skin retain moisture. The benefits for human skin were discovered by Chilean snail farmers who noticed their skin healed quickly without scarring when they handled the creatures which were being exported to France. Snail Gel is the latest in a line of bizarre anti-ageing treatments, from bee sting venom to a placenta face mask. But some experts remain sceptical about its supposed properties. Dr Adam Friedman, consultant at the Harley Street Dermatology Clinic, said: ‘There are a lot of naturally occurring lubricants which can moisturise the skin. I don’t know that snails do this more than anything else.’ Kyle Rowe, of Holland and Barrett, said the gel has been combined with aloe vera and lemongrass to make it more appealing.","New face cream contains mucus excreted by snails as they move .

'No one can stand here or stand in court and say, ""I saw Clint Caldwell punch or attack the driver."" They're just not going to be able to do that,' she said reported gothamist.com. On Friday Mr Lien was seen for the first time since he was brutally assaulted. The married . father left his Wall Street apartment in a hoodie, baseball cap and . sunglasses. He was accompanied by a woman believed to be his mother or . mother-in-law. He shielded himself from cameras as he hurried down the street in downtown Manhattan and entered a high-rise building. The emergence of the victim came as four more bikers accused of taking part in the September 29 assault appeared in court.

Bikers Reginald Chance, Clint Caldwell and Craig Wright, as well as Officer Woljciech Braszczok made court appearances on Friday. Chance was in court on Friday morning and was the second indicted following Robert Sims. On Thursday, Sims who can allegedly be seen on video dragging the driver from the SUV and beating him , was indicted.

Admission: Matthew Rodriguez, 28, is assigned to the Internal Affairs Bureau and only admitted being part of the ride a few days ago, according to a report . Braszczok also appeared on Friday but . covered his face with a hoodie on his way in and out of court. He is . next scheduled to appear in February after he testifies before a grand . jury. Caldwell was similarly not indicted and will appear before a grand jury next week. Suspect . James Kuehne appeared in court on Thursday, as the one who allegedly . hit Mr Lien repeatedly with his helmet. He has pleaded not guilty.

Lien . said he feared for the safety of his wife and two-year-old daughter who . were in the Range Rover. He has not been charged with any crime. The developments came as another NYPD officer reportedly came forward and admitted to being part of the biker gang, it was revealed on Thursday. Matthew Rodriguez, 28, who is . assigned to the Internal Affairs Bureau (IAB), only admitted being part . of the ride a few days ago, according to a DNAinfo report. It is unclear whether the five-year veteran played any part in the violence against SUV driver Alexian Lien.

The country's 232,000 teaching assistants face the axe after ministers started talks to phase out the so-called 'mums army'. The Treasury and Department for Education are considering getting rid of the classroom assistants in attempt to save some of the £4billion a year spent on them. The number of assistants, who are often used to help children with special needs, has nearly tripled since 2000, but research has found they can have a negative impact on pupils' results. Expensive: Scrapping teaching assistance would allow the Department for Education to hire more fully-qualified teachers . Studies have found that those pupils who receive help from teaching assistants make less progress than classmates of similar ability. Reducing the number of assistants would enable schools to hire more teachers as well as reduce the Department for Education budget. However, any plans to scrap the helpers would likely be subject of opposition from some parents and headteachers who value the individual attention they can give to children. Under the previous Labour government, the assistants were introduced to ease pressure on teachers and allow them more time to prepare for lessons and mark work. They earn an average of about £17,000 a year and often have few qualifications. Slow progress: Teaching assistant numbers have tripled since 2000 but they have not had an entirely positive effect on pupils . The number of assistants has increased around three-fold from 79,000 in 2000 to around 232,000. Think-tank Reform found that schools could improve value for money by cutting the number of teaching assistants and increasing class sizes. Making savings: In the drive for austerity Education Secretary Michael Gove has been overseeing major teaching reforms . Thomas Cawston, the think-tank's research director, said: 'We cited a swathe of evidence that questioned the value for money of teaching assistants and demonstrated that their impact on educational outcomes for pupils was negligible. 'We found that while they were supposed to help teachers, they were actually being allowed to take classes themselves. Not being prepared or qualified to do those classes, they were not doing a very good job. 'The money spent on teaching assistants would be far better spent on improving the quality of teachers.' But Meg Hillier, Labour MP for Hackney and Shoreditch, said: 'I fear this is just another excuse for cutting services with no regard for the real impact on the lives and opportunities of some of the neediest children.' The mass removal of teaching assistants would likely have to be phased in over several years with staff not being replaced or with assistants retrained as teachers. School budgets are ring-fenced from government cuts and head teachers can decide how to spend their budgets so changes could be difficult to implement. Both the Treasury and Department for Education declined to comment.","Assistants were introduced by Labour, earning on average £17,000 a year .

This week's edition of Saturday Night Live fulfilled a long-held dream for one New York native - host Lady Gaga. Before Gaga's opening number, though, SNL managed to lampoon both embattled Toronto Mayor Rob Ford and 60 Minutes reporter Lara Logan, both of whom have been in the news this week for all the wrong reasons. Bobby Moynihan's Ford holds even more disastrous press conferences than the ones the real Ford held last week in which he made reference to having oral sex with his wife and smoking crack. Scroll down for video . Two birds: SNL managed to poke fun at Lara Logan and Toronto Mayor Rob Ford in the same skit . Taran Killam playing a Canadian TV host points out to Ford that people were becoming dubious of his apologies and denials. 'Then I’m going to go on a show where people do believe me and will believe anything I say,' says Moynihan's Ford. The Canadian TV host asked what show would possibly believe the mayor after his previous lies and transgressions. Cut to Ford being interviewed on 60 Minutes by Lara Logan, who this week has issued a series of apologies for her report on the 2012 Benghazi attack.

Vamp: Lady Gaga opened the show with a song and dance number . Logan, played by Kate McKinnon, introduces Ford as a 'Patriot, hero, role model,' before addressing Ford's numerous indiscretions. Logan asks Ford if he's ever done crack, smoked marijuana or drunk alcohol, all of which he denies. 'So Mayor Ford, once and for all, what is the truth?' asks Logan. 'I have never done crack,' responds Ford. 'I believe you.' 'I’ve also never smoked pot.' 'I believe you.' 'And I’ve never had alcohol.' She believes him unreservedly. 'Oh, my God. This is the best show,' says Ford. Lampooned: The real life Lara Logan and Mayor Rob Ford were the subject of SNL's first skit . Lady Gaga opened the show, playing up her New York roots to get the audience onside then admitting to loving getting 'cheap applause.' She launched into a rendition of her hit Applause which then segues into an all-out Broadway-inspired 'New York, New York.' The hitmaker, who told fans earlier this week she's been wanting to host Saturday Night Live since she was 'four and three-quarters,' appeared in her first skit as a nerdy Apple Genius employee who is a guest on the imagined Kim Kardashian and Kanye West morning show, Waking up with Kimye. Mona Lisa: Gaga's character in one skit claims to be the inspiration for Marisa Tomei's character in 'My Cousin Vinny' She pulled off a believable impression of Marisa Tomei's character Mona Lisa Vito in My Cousin Vinny in a skit about an eccentric co-op board, an overzealous stage mother, and child actor. Gaga also addressed critics who said her hit song Born this Way was a rip-off of Madonna's Express Yourself. A vogue-ing, pointy-bra-clad Gaga sang her song Born this Way as part of a skit about bad cover songs. In a sketch called Upper West Side 2063, Gaga played an elderly, long-forgotten version of herself, who calls on a handy man just so she can tell him stories about herself. Self-expression: Gaga poked fun at rumors she got a little too much inspiration from Madonna's 'Express Yourself' for her song 'Born this Way' Old lady Gaga: Gaga plays herself as an old woman whose fame is long forgotten . At the end, she sat down at her piano and slowly sings the lyrics to one of her latest songs. 'I live for the applause, applause, applause,' she sings, presses a button on a machine that makes two tiny hands clap together. The hitmaker also performed two songs during the show, including her collaboration with R. Kelly, Do What U Want With My Body.","SNL managed to poke fun at Lara Logan and Rob Ford in the same skit .

This is the extraordinary moment two mothers swapped their babies back again, following an appalling maternity hospital mix-up meant they took home the wrong daughters. The women, who are both called Lyudmila and were given Caesarean operations at the same time in a Russian hospital, breast fed and bonded with each other's children. The handover came 102 days after their births, in the same maternity clinic which had committed the blunder. Scroll down for video . Lyudmila Dubayeva (left) and Lyudmila Trofimova (right) are finally reunited with their babies 102 days after they were swapped at birth in a hospital blunder . In an attempt to ease the agony, the women are for now staying together in the same hospital suite, helping each other get to know their real babies, how and when they like to be led, and which lullabies they enjoy. Both women described their ordeal as 'deeply traumatic'. Lyudmila Dubaeva, 32, said her marriage was almost wrecked because when a DNA test showed 'her' child did not belong to her husband, he feared she had been unfaithful and threatened divorce. From soon after their Caesarean operations on 6 August, both she and Lyudmila Trofimova, 28, suspected they had been given the wrong daughters - Aishat and Anna respectively - but their hospital in Naberezhnye Chelny told them such a mistake was impossible. Even when the women paid for their own DNA tests - which proved the error - the hospital kept insisting no switch had occurred, and it took a formal complaint to the police by Lyudmila Trofimova to force medics to accept the mothers were right. Finally, late last week the hospital . accepted its mistake, firing the staff responsible, and offering the . women all possible help - starting during the weekend - in exchanging . the children they have loved and cherished for more than three months, . and helping each other get to know their real babies. Lyudmila Trofimova, pictured with her baby Aishat, reported the hospital to police after they refused to admit their error . Lyudmila Dubayeva said her marriage was almost destroyed when a DNA test showed her husband was not the father of the baby she took home from hospital . 'Privet, priveeet (hello, hello!)', said Lyudmila Trofiniova to her real baby, holding her properly for the first time. 'She likes to sing and smile, and to chat.' Sitting next to her, the other Lyudmila was speechless, but kept one hand softly touching Aishat, who she has raised and will now lose. 'I realised the baby that was brought to me... was not mine,' said Lyudmila Trofimova. 'Of course I feel hard about giving Anna away... I was breastfeeding her. 'But with my all heart, and with my mind, I understand that my true own baby was there and I must get her to me.' The women have become close as they challenged a medical establishment that for weeks refused to admit its error. Lyudmila Trofimova, said she knew with 'all her heart' she had been given the wrong baby . They realised that Anna looked like a 'replica' of Lyudmila Dubaeva's elder daughter, and Aishat was the image of Lyudmila Trofimova's son. Overwhelmed with emotion, Trofimova, sitting side by side with her fellow victim, said: 'Lyudmila is more than a sister for me now, more than a relative. And the babies... what can we say? This one is my darling, my dear one - and that one is too. 'We are helping each other now and will be raising them together. The only trouble is that we do not even live in the same city, and it takes time to get to each other. But we are now bound by a very, very special bond. We will always be connected.' Earlier, Lyudmila Dubaeva, 32, explained how they suffered every woman's nightmare. 'We were operated on at the same time in the same surgical theatre. Our kids were born within  minute of each other,' she said. 'When I went for my scan during my pregnancy, I was told my baby should weigh 3,600 grams at birth but the child they brought me was only 2,800.' After being sent home with the wrong children, they kept in contact, and as their babies got bigger, they only become more certain that an appalling mistake had been committed. Lyudmila Dubaeva, 32, said: 'The DNA results came back and showed that my husband Aslan was not the father. Of course, we argued and debated. There were constant scandals in our home, and it almost came to divorce.' The other Lyudmila said she and her husband Oleg also faced misery over the swap. 'It is very, very heavy. It is really heart breaking. 'It was clear that my daughter did not look like me or my husband. But the health workers did not want to admit their mistake. 'I exchanged photos with Lyudmila, and as the girls got older, it became more obvious that they were not similar to our older children. 'I shed so many tears, and lost weight. My breast milk disappeared.' Lyudmila Trofimova, with husband Oleg Trofimov, said baby Aishat was the spitting image of her son . She added: 'Right after the birth, I asked to see my daughter and knew immediately that something was wrong because she did not look like us. 'I asked to show me Lyudmila Dubaeva's child - and saw that she was a copy of my son.' Initially the hospital claimed the DNA tests did not amount to proper evidence because they were from a private clinic. As police probed the blunder, hospital chiefs conceded and fired the chief of delivery ward Rustem Kashapov, along with an unnamed midwife. The head doctor Ravil Bakirov was reprimanded. Lyudmila Trofimova said: 'I think there were two reasons for the mistake. First, we have the same names Lyudmila Alexandrovna, and the medical staff did not pay proper attention to our family names. 'Second, there was only a minute's difference between the births. 'The nurses may have been distracted and confused the babies, or perhaps it happened when they put on their tags.' Lilia Basanova, chief doctor of the Children's Republican Clinical Hospital in Naberezhnye Chelny, said the mothers 'were admitted into one spacious room, and they swapped their babies and started getting used to them. 'Psychologists are working with the mothers, and babies are under constant supervision and control. All our clinic's specialists are working to make sure everything is fine with them. So far both babies are doing well. Lyudmila Trofimova said the trauma has cemented her friendship with Lyudmila Dubaeva . 'The mothers have found a common language, the mood is calm in their room. 'But they all need time to get used to each other, and it was at the request of both mothers that we put them all in one room. 'The mothers help each with everything they can, from suggesting a right lullaby to what position to hold the baby during breastfeeding, to the words the they are used to hearing in their first almost four months, such as what are their habits, likes and dislikes, and so on. 'They will stay at the hospital for as long as they need.' She said the hospital was seeking a 'peace deal' with the mothers over the scandal. By refusing to accept the doctors' denials, the two mothers avoided years of agony - which still continues - for two Russian familes who only discovered a similar mix-up when their daughters were aged 12. In this case, Yulia Belyaeva, 32, found that she was raising a daughter born to another mother in the maternity hospital. After conducting her own detective work, she tracked down her real daughter, now being raised by the other mother's ex-husband, who was the real father to her daughter. After navigating the initial trauma, the families decided they could not tear the girls away from the world's they know - one family is Muslim, the other Chirstian. 'We try to cope, we see each other, but it is so hard, and I feel no-one knows my agony. I could not give up my Irina, just as I can never come to terms that I will never be able to raise Anna, who I gave birth to, and is made from me,  as my own daughter. 'All we can do is try to make the best of it.' A number of similar cases have come to light in the ex-USSR with experts also warning that the true number of such mix-ups will never be known.","Two women are both called Lyudmila and babies were born by Caesarian one minute apart at the same hospital .

A piece of cake from the Queen's 1947 wedding to the Duke of Edinburgh has been put up for sale for £1,200. TV antiques dealer Gordon Watson is offering a chance to own the incredibly well-preserved, 66-year-old portion of the Queen’s wedding cake. The slice of alcohol-filled fruit cake was found by a charity worker after it lay forgotten in a filing cabinet for decades. Well-preserved: This 66-year-old portion of the Queen's wedding cake will be auctioned for around for £1,200. It was forgotten for decades and re-discovered in 2011 . Commonwealth cake: The enormous cake earned the nickname the 10,000 mile wedding cake because its ingredients were donated by the Australian Girl Guides and the rum and brandy came from South Africa . The lavish 9ft, four-tier wedding cake was split between the 2,000 guests at the wedding of Queen - then Princess Elizabeth - and Philip Mountbatten. The enormous cake earned the nickname the 10,000 mile wedding cake because its ingredients were donated by the Australian Girl Guides and the rum and brandy came from South Africa. Prince Philip cut the cake using his ceremonial sword and it was then served to guests at their reception at Buckingham Palace. One layer was kept for the christening of Prince Charles a year later and another was sent back to Australia by way of thanks. Watson, one of the world’s top dealers, snapped up the cake on Channel 4 programme Four Rooms in 2011 for £1,100. He has put the slice back on the market as part of an ‘antiques clear-out’. He said: 'Here was this manky old bit of fruit cake but it intrigued me. Joy: Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip on the balcony of Buckingham Palace after their wedding ceremony. The bridesmaids were Princess Margaret Rose (left) and Lady Mary Cambridge (second from left) The ceremony was recorded and broadcast by BBC radio to 200 million people around the world .

The fruit slice is presented in its original Buckingham Palace case, measuring 3.5 inches by 7.5 inches, dated November 20, 1947. It also comes with a compliments slip reading: ‘With the best wishes of Their Royal Highnesses The Princess Elizabeth and The Duke of Edinburgh’. Originally it had been given to CH Spackman, one of the couple’s guards of honour, following the ceremony at Westminster Abbey. After Mr Spackman died, it was given to the Princess Alice Hospice, in Esher, Surrey, in the 1990s by a supporter in the hope that it could be auctioned to raise funds. However, it lay in the drawer of a filing cabinet until charity worker Anna Fiddimore found it when she was sorting out the archives for the hospice’s 25th anniversary. Charlotte George, from auctioneers Christie’s, said: 'It is slightly peculiar but this auction is a great chance to own a slice of history. 'The cake was made using rum and brandy, which would explain how it has lasted so well. 'Remarkably, it is still in one piece, wrapped in baking parchment. I wouldn’t recommend eating it - but as a collector’s item it is fantastic.' The auction is being held at Christie’s in London on September 5. The Royal wedding took place on November 20 1947 at Westminster Abbey in London. Elizabeth first met Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark in 1934, at the wedding of Philip's cousin, Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark, and again in 1937. Before the marriage, Philip renounced his Greek and Danish titles, converted from Greek Orthodoxy to Anglicanism and adopted the style Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten, taking the surname of his mother's British family. On the morning of her wedding, as Princess Elizabeth was getting dressed at Buckingham Palace before leaving for Westminster Abbey, her tiara snapped. Luckily the court jeweller was standing by in case of emergency. The jeweller was rushed to his work room by a police escort. For her wedding dress she still required ration coupons to buy the material for her gown, designed by Norman Hartnell. The wedding ceremony was officiated by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Geoffrey Fisher and the Archbishop of York, Cyril Garbett. The ceremony was recorded and broadcast by BBC radio to 200 million people around the world. Elizabeth and Philip then proceeded to Buckingham Palace, where a breakfast was held at the Ball Supper-room. The couple received over 2,500 wedding presents from around the world and around 10,000 telegrams of congratulations.","Well-preserved cake from Queen's 1947 wedding day up for £1,200 .

The International Monetary Fund has appealed to the U.S Government to manage its finances better following the eleventh hour deal struck by politicians to avoid a catastrophic debt default. Asian stock markets rallied after American leaders struck the deal to end a 16-day Government shutdown and raise the country's debt ceiling late last night. With only hours to spare until the $16.7 trillion debt limit was reached, Congress passed and sent a waiting President Barack Obama legislation to allow more borrowing and reopen government agencies. Warning: IMF managing director Christine Lagarde, left, urged the American Government to manage its long term finances better after an eleventh hour deal to avoid a U.S debt default was signed by President Barack Obama, right . And while IMF managing director Christine Lagarde welcomed the 'important and necessary' deal, she called for a more stable approach to America's long term finances. In a statement, Ms Lagarde said: 'It will be essential to reduce . uncertainty surrounding the conduct of fiscal policy by raising the debt . limit in a more durable manner. 'We also continue to encourage the U.S. to approve a budget for 2014 and replace the sequester with gradually phased-in measures that would not harm the recovery, and to adopt a balanced and comprehensive medium-term fiscal plan.' The deal only permits the Treasury to borrow normally until February 7 and fund the government through January 15 next year. Calls: President Obama called for the U.S to 'get out of the habit of governing by crisis' following the deal . The Tokyo stock market, the region's heavyweight, gained as much as 1.1 percent after news of the deal broke. Markets in China, Hong Kong and South Korea also rebounded from losses. China and Japan, which each own more than $1 trillion of Treasury securities, appealed earlier to Washington for a quick settlement. There was no indication whether either government had altered its debt holdings. China's official Xinhua News Agency had accused Washington of jeopardizing other countries' dollar-denominated assets. It called for 'building a de-Americanized world,' though analysts say global financial markets have few alternatives to the dollar and U.S. government debt for trading and holding currency reserves. Worrying times: A US Marine holds a flag during a rally at the National World War II Memorial earlier this week in Washington, calling for an end to the partial government shutdown . Asian companies and investors had expressed confidence the United States would avoid a default, but had sold Treasurys to avoid possible losses if Washington delayed repayment. Others put off buying stocks that might be exposed to a U.S. downturn. Ms Lagarde's comments seemed to echo those made by President Obama following the deal. He said that the U.S must 'get out of the habit of governing by crisis' following the stand-off that had brought the country to the brink of economic catastrophe.

Moments earlier, he had officially signed a Democrat-led bill ended the Government shutdown. Both halves of Congress had been racing to beat a midnight deadline imposed by the Treasury Department, which declared that unless it had a larger global credit card, the US would no longer have enough cash on hand to pay interest to its creditors.

Craig Shirley, 42, was the first person in the UK to receive an abdominal wall transplant, and has told how the operation transformed his life . Two patients who received the first abdominal wall transplants in the UK are enjoying the simple things in life, after the groundbreaking operation transformed their lives. Craig Shirley, 42, was the first person in the UK to receive the transplant while Amy Grime, 28, was the first woman to undergo the procedure. Before their operations, both had to be fed intravenously for several years and found themselves mostly housebound. But now their lives have been turned around and they can eat and drink normally as well as take up much-loved hobbies. Mr Shirley, from Royal Wootton Bassett in Wiltshire, received a combined abdominal wall and bowel wall transplant at the Churchill Hospital as part of the intestinal transplant programme at the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust. He fell ill in January 2011 while at the gym, suffering numbness down his left side and blurred vision. Fearing he may have had a stroke, he visited his GP but hospital tests were inconclusive. The day after being discharged, Mr Shirley began to suffer terrible abdominal pain and phoned 999. He was admitted to hospital, where doctors removed the vast majority of his small intestine after discovering a clot. Mr Shirley was in intensive care for two weeks and then spent a further six weeks in a high dependency unit. He was then transferred to the specialised intestinal unit at Salford Royal Hospital. The fitness fanatic was put on a transplant waiting list, receiving his operation in June last year. He said: 'Before my transplant, I could not eat or drink and needed to be fed intravenously for 14 hours a day. 'Although I could have tastes of food and drink, I did not benefit nutritionally from them at all. 'Now I have a completely normal diet. After 18 months of not being allowed to eat, I confess I ate a lot of chocolate, sweets and cakes. Now, I'm cutting down those treats and achieving a more balanced diet. 'I'm also working on building up my energy. I used to do a lot of fitness activities and go to the gym and I'm working my way up to being able to do more. 'Having the transplant has been amazing, it's changed my life completely. 'I was originally told I would never eat again, never get up to go to the gym again. What happened to me was so out of the blue because I was very fit. My family were told to expect the worst but I've managed to come through.' Ms Grime, 28, suffered severe Crohn's disease from an early age and spent much of her childhood and teenage years in hospital where she underwent bowel resection surgery. Amy Grime, 28, was the first woman in the UK to receive an abdominal wall transplant. Ms Grime, 28, suffered severe Crohn's disease from an early age and spent much of her childhood and teenage years in hospital . After contracting septicaemia and MRSA, she developed multiple abnormal growths across her abdominal wall and was left with only 60 to 90cm of her small bowel. Ms Grime was also losing up to four litres of liquid a day through her abdominal wall, which was scarred and damaged following years of surgery. After being put on the transplant waiting list, Ms Grime had a bowel and abdominal wall transplant at the Churchill Hospital in January this year. She said: 'I was fed intravenously on and off for about eight or nine years. 'In the last year before my transplant, I was fed this way for 12 hours every night. 'I was permanently dehydrated and pretty housebound. 'The operation has changed my life. Although I do experience some problems, I wouldn't go back. I can now go out for meals, I can eat, drink and socialise. I do normal day-to-day things that I couldn't do before - it was a nightmare. She said she can now go out for meals, eat, drink and socialise . 'This time a year ago, I was struggling to do the most simple of tasks and everyday was spent hooked up to a machine. I have regained my quality of life. I am back on my horse, socialising with my friends and I am really enjoying being able to eat as normal.' Ms Grime is currently off work from her job as a theatre clerk at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford but is hoping to go back soon. Since June 2012, a total of 10 patients have undergone abdominal wall transplant surgery at the Churchill Hospital. Every year, around 25 to 30 people require small bowel transplant operations. Half of these patients may also need an abdominal wall transplant because their own abdominal wall muscle has suffered due to injury or multiple operations. Consultant surgeon Henk Giele, who is a member of the British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons (Bapras), led the team who carried out the operations. He said: 'An intestinal transplant is both life-saving and life-creating. It helps to solve extremely difficult living conditions for patients, many of whom have spent years unable to eat solid food leaving them completely reliant on intravenous feeding for up to 18 hours a day. 'For these people, being able to eat and taste again is a revelation, so this is truly transformative surgery. 'Whilst our progress over the past year is hugely exciting, we want to raise awareness that this type of surgery is now possible, as we are reliant on the generosity of donors for transplant procedures to go ahead. 'The success of these first operations has been made possible through close collaboration between all transplant surgeons, anaesthetic staff, donor co-ordinators, as well as the NHS Blood and Transplant.'","Craig Shirley, 42, the first person in the UK to receive the transplant .

A New Jersey mother is trying to come to terms with the death of her two-year-old daughter after accidentally running down the child in a dark driveway on Saturday night. Orialis Andion  was picking up her three children from their grandparents house in Vineland, Cumberland County, about 8.30pm when 'she ended up going forward instead of backward', hitting her little girl in the process. Jaelise Rodriguez, who would have turned three in March, died from the injuries she sustained from the car. 'She didn't see the baby,' the aunt of Jaelise,  Edissell Rodriguez, told Press Of Atlantic City. In grief: Ramon Rodriguez holds up a photo of his young granddaughter Jaelise Rodriguez (right) out the front of his house in Vineland, where the little girl died on Saturday night . Edissell also said it is unclear why Jaelise was not in the car, since her mom had come to pick her up, along with two other children, from Jaelise’s grandparents’ house. The house is on a quiet cul-de-sac at the end of the section of Venus Drive that crosses Swelin Drive off West Oak Road. Jaelise’s grandfather, Ramon Rodriguez, was home when the accident happened but didn’t see how it unfolded. 'It’s hard to explain what we feel,' he said. 'Grandpas are an extension (of the parents). 'We love probably more.' No charges have been filed. An investigation is ongoing.

'Forever in our hearts': Family, friends and neighbors hold a prayer session for Jaelise Rodriguez, 2, after leaving flowers, candles, toys and balloons outside the house she died . Family, friends and neighbors have started a vigil outside the house, leaving flowers, balloons, toys and candles to show their condolences. Jaelise is the third Vineland child to die in accidents involving vehicles since October 30. Alexa Strittmatter, 14, was hit by two cars while crossing Main Road to a bus stop. Jermire Lowery, also 14, died in a crash near Almond and Mill Roads on November 11. '(Jaelise) was a happy child who liked to dance,' said neighbor and family friend Cerise Evans.

Jermire Lowery, also 14, was killed on November 11 about 7.50pm when the Checy Malibu he was travelling in struck a truck along Almond Road near Mill Road . Edissell said Jaelise was well liked by other kids. 'Anywhere we went, she’d say hi to everyone,' Edissell said. 'Other kids loved her.' Jaelise is succeeded by four-year-old brother, Julius, and eight-year-old stepbrother, Jay’qwan, Edissell said. Aunt Edili Rodriguez brought pink and white flowers to the memorial as she prepared to help her brother with his grief.

A North Carolina police officer was awarded the Medal of Valor after surgically removing and defusing a bomb implanted into a man’s neck – without wearing protective gear. Charlotte Bomb Squad Sgt. Robert Whitley received the award Tuesday for heroically racing to a hospital Sept 15 to remove the improvised explosive device while putting himself at great risk. X-rays and CAT scans showed the object lodged in the man’s neck was a large, unexploded bomb – the man was trying to commit suicide, WSOC reported. The unconscious man lie on a table in the hospital while staff evacuated for their own safety. Doctors afraid to operate called the police, calling Mr Whitely into action. 'It looked to be a rifle bullet, homemade, sealed with marble, one of which was impaled in right side of his neck,' a doctor told ABC News. ‘I've never seen anything like this,’ he told the station .

Back in August, the kittens brought the subway in Brooklyn to a standstill for several hours after they wandered onto the tracks - causing delays for commuters and even sparking a mayoral debate. Now, the cheeky duo have been adopted by a couple who live in the borough. Keith Lubeley, 33, and his wife Katherine Lynn, 30, were among the hundreds of people who wanted to adopt the now 11-week-old felines. Scroll down for video . A new home: Kittens Arthur (left) and August, who strayed onto subway tracks two months ago, have been adopted by a couple from New York City. They are seen above at the pair's apartment in Brooklyn Heights . Gimme shelter: After their drama, the cats were treated at the Animal Care and Control shelter in East New York (where they are pictured, above) The kittens now live with Keith Lubeley, 33, and his wife Katherine Lynn, 30, who were among the hundreds of people who wanted to adopt the 11-week-old felines . 'We don't really know what made us stand out, since the application didn't exactly have an essay question,' they told the Daily Intelligencer. The couple, who live in a Brooklyn Heights apartment, added: 'Maybe our desire to help rescue animals came through in the few words we were allotted to describe our interest in these guys. 'That and the fact that we've each been cat owners in the past, live in a relatively quiet place, and don't have kids or other pets.' Katherine, who works for a theatre consulting firm, and Keith also said they would be voting for mayoral hopeful Bill de Blasio - and not Joe Lhota, who himself played an indirect role in the furry saga. The two kittens were caught between the rails on subway tracks in the Brooklyn borough of New York at the end of the August . The pair caused an outage on the B and Q lines which lasted several hours . Sourpuss: New York Republican Mayoral . candidate Joe Lhota said that he would not have shut off subway service . to rescue the kittens . Lhota, the former chairman of the Metropolitan Transit Authority, said he wouldn’t have stopped the subway as the kittens scrambled along the tracks. A spokesman for Lhota told the New York Post at the time that the candidate did not think stopping service for wayward cats was appropriate. He said Lhota believed it should be the MTA’s call whether to shut down the line. Passengers on the lines were stranded while police officers chased the cats down the tracks . Back on August 29, power was cut on B and Q lines in Brooklyn for more than an hour as the two lost kittens scurried around the tracks. They were finally rescued about seven hours later and were treated at an animal shelter. Lhota’s rivals in the mayoral race, among them Anthony Weiner, told the paper they would’ve stopped trains to save the pets. A spokesperson for the disgraced former congressman went even further, saying that the candidate would have risked his own life to rescue the helpless critters. 'If Anthony is elected mayor, he will not only stop trains for kittens, he will personally crawl over the third rail to do it,' Barbara Morgan told the Post. Entertained: While most commuters were furious at the delays, the two kittens kept small children amused at various train stations . Campaigning outside a subway stop Friday, Mr Weiner jokingly told the New York Daily News that if elected mayor, he would put in place a comprehensive subway kitten rescue policy. Other candidates also stated their position on the issue of whether or not to stop the trains for the kitties. Christine Quinn came out on the side of the furry felines, as did Bill Thompson's campaign. The aptly named John Catsimatidis deferred to the MTA or police, but noted that he is an animal lover who once owned a beloved feline named Cottonball. For former City Councilman Sal Albanese, it was a no-brainer. ‘What are we, nuts? Of course I would’ve stopped,’ he said. ‘This almost never happens, but when it does, we can’t just go running over kittens.’ Cat calls: Both Anthony Weiner (left) and Christine Quinn said they would have shut off power in the subway to rescue the kitties. Weiner went so far as to say he would have personally saved them . With a name like that: John Catsimatidis said he would have deferred to the MTA or police, but noted that he is an animal lover who once had a cat . While the mayoral hopefuls were opining on the fate of the kittens, August and Arthur were recuperating at an Animal Care & Control shelter in the East New York section of Brooklyn. The then 8-week-old pets were kept together as they are underwent physical and behavioral tests. August and Arthur, who each weighed around 2lb at the time of rescue, were vaccinated and  transferred to a foster home. When the two tiny felines were spotted frolicking on the train tracks near the Church Avenue station in Brooklyn about 11am, MTA workers turned off the power. Passengers on the B and Q lines were stranded for about two hours while police officers chased the cats down the tracks. According to the Wall Street Journal, . a spokeswoman said police officers went onto the tracks to roust the . cats so they wouldn't be at risk. She also said the MTA did not wish to . accidentally 'fry' the kittens. Crews suspended regular service from .

The human papilloma virus (HPV) has been linked to cervical, head and neck cancers - and is classed as a sexually transmitted disease. But new research has suggested it may be possible for people carrying the virus to unwittingly transmit it to other parts of their body. Women in the study who engaged in behaviours that could mean HPV was transferred from their genitals to their mouth were nearly four times more likely to have an oral HPV . infection than those who didn't. Women who engaged in behaviours that could mean HPV was transferred from their gentials to their mouth were nearly four times more likely to have an oral HPV infection than those who didn't, a study found (file pic) The  LiveScience report suggests that these women must have already had an HPV infection in the genitals for it to then be transferred. The findings of the research, presented last week at the American Public Health Association meeting in Boston, held even after other factors that may increase the risk of oral HPV infection -  such as the number of sexual partners - were considered. Human papillomavirus infection causes . genital warts and is associated with a higher risk of developing . genital, head and neck cancers. It is spread through sexual contact and is more . usually associated with cervical cancer in women. The virus can be passed between men and women by genital contact, most often during vaginal and anal sex. It . may also be passed on during oral sex and genital-to-genital contact, even when the . infected person has no signs or symptoms. New research has suggested it may be possible for people carrying the HPV virus to unwittingly transmit it to other parts of their body, increasing the risk of oral cancer . In her study, researcher Natalie Kelso . quizzed more than 1,000 college women on their sexual habits and tested . them for oral HPV. She then asked them questions about transferring a disease from one part of their body to another, known as self-inoculation. These included: 'Has a hand, yours or someone else's, ever touched your genitals, and then touched your mouth?' and 'Have you ever put your mouth on a sex toy after it had touched your genitals?,' LiveScience reported. Ms Kelsoe, a doctoral student at the University of Florida College of Public Health and Health Professions, reported that two per cent of participants had an oral HPV infection, and 16 per cent had engaged in behaviours that could lead to self-inoculation. HPV is blamed for up to 80 per cent of these tumours of the tonsils and the back of the tongue . Among the  self-inoculation group, six per cent had an oral HPV infection, compared with just 1.2 percent of those who had never engaged in behaviours that could lead to further transmission. Although most mouth and throat cancers are normally blamed on drinking . and smoking, an increasing number of cases that occur around the tonsils . and back of the tongue are due to HPV. In . the U.S., HPV is blamed for up to 80 per cent of these tumours of the . tonsils and the back of the tongue, which experts say could be due to . increasing popularity of oral sex. In Britain, the number of mouth and throat cancers have increased by 40 per cent in just a decade, to 6,200 cases a year. Cancer Research UK says HPV may be key to the ‘rapid rise’. But the new study's author, Natalie . Kelso, a doctoral student at the University of Florida College of Public . Health and Health Profession, adds that more work is needed before a full conclusion can be made on the self-infection theory. Research published earlier this year found that infection with certain strains of HPV significantly increases . the risk of cancers in the back of the throat, new research has found. University of Oxford researchers found that more than a third of those who had oropharyngeal cancers . - those at the back of the throat - also carried antibodies to one of . HPV’s key cancer-causing proteins – a protein from the HPV16 virus . called E6. In comparison, less than one per cent of people without cancer carried the antibodies in their blood. HPV’s . E6 protein disables the p53 protein which is known as the ‘guardian of . the genome’ because it protects cells from DNA damage and the . development of cancer. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is spread through sexual . contact and is more usually associated with cervical cancer in women. It . is the most commonly sexually transmitted infection in the U.S. HPV can be passed between men and women by genital contact, most often during vaginal and anal sex. It . may also be passed on during oral sex and genital-to-genital contact. It can be passed on between straight and same-sex partners—even when the . infected person has no signs or symptoms. The cervical cancer . jab given to 12 and 13-year-old schoolgirls aims to cut their odds of . the cancer by protecting them against the virus. Although most . mouth and throat cancers are normally blamed on drinking and smoking an . increasing number of cases that occur around the tonsils and back of the . tongue are due to HPV. Although the cancer is not contagious, the virus is. In . the US, HPV is blamed for up to 80 per cent of these tumours of the . tonsils and the back of the tongue, which experts say could be due to . increasing popularity of oral sex.

Joshua Savyon, nine, was shot dead by his father during a supervised visit at a YWCA in New Hampshire in August . A father, who killed himself and his nine-year-old son during a supervised visit at a YWCA because he was upset over custody arrangements, emailed his neighbors earlier that day and told them there was nothing anyone could do to stop him. The email that Muni Savyon sent to his neighbors in New Hampshire was included in a report issued on Thursday by the state attorney general's office. According to the report, Savyon and his son, Joshua, had been talking and playing games for about 40 minutes during the August 11 visit when Savyon unzipped a black briefcase, took out a handgun and shot the boy in the back of the head. He stood and shot the boy five more times before killing himself, the report states. 'There's . one important thing you should know: There was nothing that you, or . anyone close to me, could have done to prevent the tragedy,' Savyon . wrote to his neighbors. 'Do you need to know why I did this? Never mind. The man is insane.' Though . Savyon had been scanned by a hand-held metal detector for previous . visits at the YWCA, he was not before the fatal shooting. Workers . told investigators that they had police officers providing security . when the policy requiring the scans was enacted, but staff had been . 'loose' on enforcing it since funding cuts reduced that security. He stood and shot the boy five more times before killing himself, the report states. One worker told investigators that staffers weren't sure what they would do if they found a gun on someone. Before the murder-suicide, Muni Savyon emailed his neighbors saying no one could have prevented the tragedy . Born in Israel, Savyon was a naturalized citizen who lived in several Western states before coming to New England, where he worked as a software engineer. Savyon and the boy's mother, Becky Ranes, were not married, and according to court documents and Thursday's report, he had been upset over custody arrangements and had told her he would kill either her or himself and their son if he didn't get what he wanted. Ranes told investigators that Savyon told her in March 2012: 'You can only push someone so far before they snap. I've snapped,' and 'I live in New Hampshire and I now have a gun. It will be you or it will be me and Joshua. You will see it on the news.' In his email, Savyon criticized Ranes for believing in government authority and called her 'a bad influence'. 'And now she will be left alone with the terrible sadness that her only son has been taken from her, a sadness that I am very familiar with,' he wrote. Police surround the YWCA in New Hampshire after a father shot his nine-year-old son dead before turning the gun on himself . Assistant Attorney General Jeffery Strelzin said the email was sent earlier in the day August 11 but declined to say exactly when. The center's director has declined to comment on the details of the shooting but emphasized that the possibility of violence exists for all the families who use the center for supervised visits, or else they wouldn't need to be supervised. And she said having a constant police presence would work against the center's goal of providing a homelike atmosphere.","Muni Savyon emailed his neighbors in New Hampshire to say that 'nothing could be done to prevent the tragedy'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 08:32 EST, 16 November 2011 . Defence chiefs have warned that the U.S. is prepared to retaliate with military force if it came under cyber attack. In the most explicit statement about cyber security to date, Pentagon officials said that they reserved the right to use ‘all necessary means to defend our allies, our partners and our interests.’ ‘When warranted, we will respond to hostile attacks in cyberspace as we would to any other threat to our country,’ the 12-page report to Congress  noted. Defence: The paper was written for Congress by security chiefs at the Pentagon in response to growing problems with cyber attacks . Hostile acts, it said, could include ‘significant cyber attacks directed against the U.S. economy, government or military’ and the response could use electronic means or more conventional military options. The report, mandated by the 2011 Defence Authorisation Act, was made public yesterday. Cyberspace is a particularly challenging domain for the Pentagon. Defence Department employees operate more than 15,000 computer networks with seven million computers at hundreds of locations around the world. The networks are probed millions of times a day and penetrations have caused the loss of thousands of files. Their vulnerability was highlighted by the case of Bradley Manning, who is accused of stealing hundreds of thousands of documents and passing them to the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks. Private companies also face relentless cyber attacks, including an increasing number linked to countries like China and Russia, and they have grown increasingly frustrated about the U.S. government's lack of response. ‘There is a massive amount of frustration on the part of the private sector,’ Dmitri Alperovitch, the former vice president of threat research at McAfee, told an event hosted by the George C. Marshall Institute. U.S. companies are losing billions of dollars to cyber theft each year, he said. ‘Nothing is being done,’ Alperovitch said. ‘Something has to be done from a policy perspective to address the threat ... ‘The fact that it is China, the fact that it is Russia. What are we going to do to face those countries and get them to stop?’ Hackers: Experts say U.S. companies lose billions through cyber attack every year . The report said the Defence Department was attempting to deter aggression in cyberspace by developing effective defences that prevent adversaries from achieving their objectives and by finding ways to make attackers pay a price for their actions. ‘Should the “deny objectives” element of deterrence not prove adequate,’ the report said, ‘DoD (Department of Defence) maintains, and is further developing, the ability to respond militarily in cyberspace and in other domains.’ Key to a military response is being able to quickly identify the source of an attack, particularly challenging due to the anonymous nature of the Internet, the report said. In an effort to crack that problem, the Pentagon is supporting research focusing on tracing the physical source of an attack and using behavior-based algorithms to assess the likely identity of an attacker, the report said. U.S. security agencies also are grooming a cadre of highly skilled cyber forensics experts and are working with international partners to share information in a timely manner about cyber threats, including malicious code and the people behind it, it said. Attacks on U.S. computer networks have become more frequent and more damaging in recent years, costing U.S. companies an estimated $1 trillion in lost intellectual property, competitiveness and damage. One defence company lost some 24,000 files in an intrusion in March. Lani Kass, who recently retired as a senior policy adviser to the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, said enemies of the United States were becoming more savvy every day. ‘You have got to assume that what we do in cyberspace can be done to us quicker, cheaper and with fewer restrictions,"" she told Reuters after the Marshall Institute event. Before moving to offensive action, the United States would exhaust all other options, weigh the risk of action against the cost of inaction and ‘act in a way that reflects our values and strengthens our legitimacy, seeking broad international support wherever possible,’ the report said. ‘If directed by the president, DoD will conduct offensive cyber operations in a manner consistent with the policy principles and legal regimes that the department follows for kinetic capabilities, including the law of armed conflict,’ the report said. The report followed the release in mid-July of the Pentagon's cybersecurity policy, which designated cyberspace as an ‘operational domain’ like land, sea and air where U.S. forces would be trained to conduct offensive and defensive operations.",Pentagon: 'We will use all necessary means to defend our interests'

Virtual currency Bitcoin has more than doubled its value in a month reaching a high of $267 (£165.70). This beats its previous record of $266 (£165.15) set in April, which was followed within a week by a dramatic drop to $100 (£62).

Virtual currency Bitcoin has more than doubled its value in a month reaching an all-time high of $267 (£165.70) The digital currency is increasingly being treated like gold, with some investors using it to hedge against currency fluctuations and speculating on its rise. The current rise follows the launch of the world’s first bitcoin ATM, dubbed Robocoin, in a trendy Vancouver coffee shop. The blue and silver ATM machine, which is operated by Vancouver-based Bitcoiniacs and Nevada-based Robocoin, changes bitcoins to Canadian dollars and vice versa. Users scan their hand to confirm identity, and then funds move to or from a virtual wallet on their smartphone. The ATM, named Robocoin, allows users to buy or sell the digital currency known as bitcoins. Once only used for black market sales on the internet, bitcoins are starting to be accepted at a growing number of businesses . Bitcoin is a distributed peer-to-peer . digital currency that functions without any central authority, such as . the Bank of England. The currency was launched in 2008 and is traded within a global network of computers. Bitcoins can be bought with near anonymity, which supporters say lowers fraud risk and increases privacy. But critics say that also makes bitcoins a magnet for drug transactions, money-laundering and other illegal activities. Bitcoins are currently worth around $267 (£165.70). A bitcoin investor, Norwegian Kristoffer Koch, recently made more than half a million pounds after he forgot he bought £17 of currency four years. The system limits transfers to $1,000 (£623) a day, in an effort to curb money laundering and other fraud. Bitcoiniacs, the local dealer that operates the ATM, will roll out four other kiosks across Canada in December. By the end of 2014, they expect to roll the technology out worldwide. Bitcoin is not a recognised currency in Canada, so Ottawa's anti-money laundering watchdog, the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre, does not monitor its trade. Bitcoins were launched in 2008 and are traded within a global network of computers. They are not backed by a single company or government, but their release is tightly controlled, mimicking a central banking system's control over the minting of money. A bitcoin investor, Norwegian Kristoffer Koch, made a huge profit, after he forgot he bought £17 of currency four years. He recently found out he was sitting on a small fortune now worth more than half a million pounds. Bitcoins are stored in encrypted wallets secured with a private key. Mr Koch had forgotten his password but when he eventually remembered it he was stunned by how much they had jumped in value.

'We have no idea where these people are,' Copiah County Sheriff Harold Jones told ABC News. 'We have some people we need to talk to, but we can't find them.' Police initially thought that Mrs Hughes-Smith and Mr Smith torched the truck as a form of insurance fraud - a practice not uncommon in the area. However, they have since ruled out that explanation. Jones will not say whether he believed foul play is involved, though he will not rule it out, either. Jaidon is 3 feet tall, 44 pounds, black skin and brown eyes. Atira Hughes-Smith is 5 feet tall, 148 pounds, black with brown eyes and brown hair. Laterry Smith is 5-foot-8, 180 pounds and black with browns eyes and brown hair.

Controversy: Rolling Stone faced backlash for putting Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on its cover - but sales are up . Rolling Stone's controversial 'Boston Bomber' cover doubled the magazine's monthly sales despite the fact it sparked an intense backlash that saw it pulled from mammoth retailers like CVS and Stop & Stop. According to newly released figures, news stand sales of the August issue, which had Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's face splashed dreamily across the cover, jumped 102 per cent over average per-issue sales for the past year. Nearly 1500 retailers sold some 13,232 copies of the 'Boston Bomber' issue from July 19 to July 29, despite a 'Boycott Rolling Stone' campaign on Facebook and politicians weighing in to slam the magazine's editor. Critics accused Rolling Stone of being insensitive and glorifying a notorious criminal in a way usually reserved for rock stars. The 19-year-old appeared in the photo with boyish good-looks and tussled curls. The photo was a self-portrait by Tsarnaev and had previously appeared on the cover of the May 5 edition of The New York Times, with distinctly less furor. According to Ad Week, the boycott campaign was never going to have a huge impact on the magazine's overall bottom line as only 5 per cent of Rolling Stone's total circulation comes from retail sales. But the out-performance, does signify how controversy, and the attention it garners, usually only helps rather than hinders magazine issues flying off the stands. When it was released at the start of the month, Boston officials and victims lambasted the magazine for celebrating the suspect and ignoring the victims, and retailers, including CVS and Walgreens, pulled the edition from its shelves. Boycott: Even tough CVS and Walgreens refused to sell the edition, sales for this month are up . But a circulation source told the New York Post on July 24, that sales for the issue were already running 20 per cent above the normal rate by the first weekend. Rolling . Stone usually sells around 81,000 copies, but the estimated . sell-through at that stage was already believed to be at least 90,000 . copies, the source said. A Rolling Stone spokeswoman declined to comment on the figures. The . cover identifies the terrorist suspect simply as 'The Bomber'. The . article promises to explain 'how a popular, promising student was failed . by his family, fell into radical Islam, and became a monster'. The cover of Rolling Stone is . typically occupied by rock stars and actors, and many felt the choice . glorified Tsarnaev, who is accused of killing four people and wounding . more than 260. Boston Mayor Thomas Menino described the . cover as a 'total disgrace' and said it should have put survivors or . first responders on the cover. Outcry: Boston Mayor Thomas Menino, left, and Richard 'Dic' Donohue, right, who was shot in a gunfight with the suspected bombers, criticized the magazine for using Tsarnaev's picture and ignoring the victims . No apology: Rolling Stone Publisher Jann Wenner, pictured last week, refused to apologize and said the cover of the August edition was consistent with their history of serious journalism . 'Why are we glorifying a guy who created . mayhem in the city of Boston?' Menino asked . 'Why would we want to heroize this guy? He's a terrorist. We don't want him in our neighborhoods. We don't want . him on magazines. We don't want him anywhere.' MBTA Transit Officer Richard 'Dic' Donahue, who almost died when he was shot during a firefight with the Tsarnaev brothers, said: 'I cannot and do not . condone the cover of the magazine.' Despite the overwhelmingly negative reactions, the editors of Rolling Stone refused to apologize for their controversial choice, claiming it was in keeping with their long tradition of serious journalism. In their brief statement, Rolling Stone - founded in the 1960s by Jann Wenner who is still editor-in-chief - said their 'hearts go out to the victims of the Boston Marathon bombing, and our thoughts are always with them'. 'The cover story we are publishing this week falls within the traditions of journalism and Rolling Stone's long-standing commitment to serious and thoughtful coverage of the most important political and cultural issues of our day,' it said. Weak: In response to the cover, police photographer Sgt Sean Murphy released images, including this one, he took of the moment a bloodied Tsarnaev was apprehended in Watertown on April 19 . Defiant: Sgt Murphy, right, arrives at State Police Headquarters with his son on Tuesday, where he learned he has been put on desk duty until an investigation into his conduct is complete . Pointing out that Dzhokhar is in the . same age group as many of their readers, Rolling Stone said that fact . 'makes it all the more important for us to examine the complexities of . this issue'. The use of Tsarnaev as cover star caused an immediate backlash on social media and CVS and Walgreens announced that they would be boycotting the edition from their stores nationwide. Between them, CVS and Walgreens have more than 15,000 locations across the U.S. In response to the cover, police photographer Sgt. Sean Murphy released photographs showing a weak and bloodied Tsarnaev in the moments before he was captured. The Massachusetts police did not authorize the release of the images, and he has now been put on desk duty until an investigation into his conduct is complete. Tsarnaev, who is currently being held without bail in a federal prison in Massachusetts, has pleaded not guilty to 30 counts - including the four killings - associated with the bombing.","According to newly released figures, news stand sales of the August issue jumped 102 per cent over average per-issue sales for the past year .

A former Chinese labor camp inmate has thanked the Oregon woman who helped expose his plight after finding his plea for help hidden in Halloween decorations. The letter about horrendous working conditions at a Chinese labor camp was found by Julie Keith last year, stuffed between styrofoam headstones of a Totally Ghoul decoration box sold at Kmart. The man named only as Mr Zhang, who spent two and a half years in the notorious Masanjia labor camp in 2008, thanked Ms Keith for her 'righteous action that helped people in desperation'. Scroll down for video . Discovery: Julie Keith helped expose conditions in a Chinese labor camp after finding a note from a prisoner inside a box of Halloween decorations, pictured right . He had been freed from the camp by the time the letter he risked his life to write was discovered, but Mr Zhang told CNN he is grateful that Ms Keith helped shine a light on the appalling conditions there. The mother-of two, from Portland, had originally thought the letter was a hoax but, after reading up on forced labor camps, she tried to publicize Mr Zhang's plight. Since receiving the note, written in broken English and Chinese, Ms Keith is more careful about buying products from abroad. 'It . is quite ironic that it was a bloody graveyard kit that I purchased - . knowing that the people who made these kits were desperate and bloody . themselves,' Ms Keith said. 'Now I check the labels and try not to buy things I don't necessarily need, especially if it is made in China,' she added. In his first TV interview Mr Zhang, who was sent to the camp just before Beijing hosted the Olympic Games in 2008, told CNN he is still haunted by his time there. Gratitude: The former inmate who smuggled the letter into the box has written to thank Julie Keith for her help . Plea for help: The letter, pictured, came in a box of Halloween decorations purchased in Oregon . The follower of the banned Falun Gong spiritual movement said: 'For people who have never been there, . it's impossible to imagine. The first thing they do is to . take your human dignity away and humiliate you.' Sir:If . you occasionally buy this product, please kindly resend this letter to . the World Human Right Organization. Thousands people here who are under . the persicution [sic] of the Chinese Communist Party Government will . thank and remember you forever.This product produced by Unit 8, Department 2, Mashanjla Labour Camp, Shen Young, Liaoning, China.People . who work here have to work 15 hours a day without Saturday (or) Sunday . break and any holidays, otherwise they will suffer torturement [sic], . beat and rude remark, nearly no payment (10 Yuan/one month).People . who work here suffer punishment 1-3 years averagelly [sic], but without . court sentence. Many of them are Falun Gong practitioners who are . totally innocent people. Only because they have different believe [sic] . to the CCPG, they often suffer more punishment than others. He claimed he was systematically beaten, suffered sleep deprivation and was tortured at the camp in Shenyang, the provincial capital of Liaoning. 'Making products turned out to be an . escape from the horrible violence,' he said. 'We thought we could . protect ourselves, and avoid verbal and physical assaults as long as we . worked and did the job well.' Mr Zhang came up with the idea of trying to alert the outside world to the prisoners' plight after they were ordered to make Halloween decorations. 'I saw the packaging and figured the . products were bound for some English-speaking countries,' he said. 'I had this idea of telling the outside world what was happening there-  it was a revelation even to someone like me who had spent my entire . life in China.' Using a pen and paper he smuggled into the camp, and writing late at night to avoid being caught by the guards who watched even as inmates tried to sleep under the glare of electric lights, Mr Zhang wrote about 20 letters - one of which reached Ms Keith. The unsigned note began: 'Sir: If you . occasionally buy this product, please kindly resend this letter to the . World Human Right Organization' 'Thousands people here who are under the . persicution [sic] of the Chinese Communist Party Government will thank . and remember you forever.' Torture: Mr Zhang, pictured right in his first TV interview, says he suffered unimaginable horrors at the camp . When the Oregon mother was unable to get a satisfactory response from the agencies she contacted, she alerted the world's press to her discovery, which made the forced labor camps the center of international attention. She contacted U.S. customs officials who have filed her report, but said they told her there was little they could do. A spokeswoman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) declined to confirm . the existence of an investigation, but said: 'These allegations . are very serious and are an investigative priority for ICE.' The camp where Mr Zhang was forced to work for long hours has since been closed down as the new leadership in China makes the first steps to reform of its 'reeducation through labor' policy. A 50-year-old Chinese farmer, who was also detained at the camp, returned to it last month with CNN after hearing that the remaining inmates had been released. 'We had the 4.15am . wake-up call, worked from 6am to noon, got a 30-minute lunch and . bathroom break, and resumed working until 5.:30pm. Sometimes we had to . stay up until midnight if there was too much work - and if you couldn't . finish your work, you would be punished,' Liu Hua said. Ms Liu, who suffered from high blood pressure and malnutrition, said she was denied medical care and guards ordered fellow inmates to beat her for being defiant. End of an era? The last inmates of Mashanjla Labor Camp have been released after intense scrutiny over conditions there . She lost consciousness during the beating but, when she came round, she was ordered back to work. 'This place was Hell on Earth,' she said. Chinese officials have acknowledged poor living and labor conditions, but denied the use of torture. An official also confirmed that the letter Ms Keith received did come from the Masanjia men's camp. International reports about its discovery caused a stir in the camp. Alongside . the production work there are hours of 're-education classes' involving . endless repetition of camp rules or singing of patriotic songs while . standing in the sun. People like Mr Zhang who speak out about the cruelty of the camps can often find themselves severely punished. Journalist . and former New York Times photographer Du Bin, who released a . documentary on the Masanjia camp featuring interviews with former . inmates has been detained by security officials since May 31, according . to his sister. Most of . the products are made for use in China, but inmates say they also made . coat linings labelled 'Made In Italy' and Christmas wreaths for South . Korea, among other items for export. Amnesty International believes there are more than 300 of these camps. The . camp drew press attention again in April when Beijing-based Lens . Magazine published accounts by former detainees, in which they described . being shocked with electric batons, starved, and beaten. Hidden: The letter was folded into eighths and hidden amongst the the Styrofoam headstones in the Totally Ghoul product, pictured . The . magazine quoted the diary of Masanjia inmate Wang Guilan as saying the . camp accepted pregnant women and disabled individuals, forcing them to . work for up to 14 hours a day, or risk being beaten. In . an interview with Radio Free Asia's Mandarin Service in January, Ms . Guilan said that guards at the Masanjia women's camp chained detainees . up and tortured them in hideous ways, including sexually. A .

John Donne may have one of the most famous English poets of the 17th Century, but today no one really knows what he sounded like. His sermons, delivered in the courtyard of St Paul’s Cathedral, drew some of the largest and most influential crowds in the country. Now researchers in the U.S. have attempted to bring Donne’s sermons back to life by reconstructing the acoustics of the courtyard as it was in 1622. Scroll down for video and audio... Researchers at North Carolina State University have combined scholarship and new technologies to re-create the courtyard of St Paul's Cathedral in London as it stood in 1622 . ‘This is as close as you can come to visiting 17th century London and hearing John Donne speak without a time machine,’ said Dr John Wall, a professor of English at North Carolina State University. The project aims to answer some longstanding questions about religion and literature in 17th century London. ‘We know that large crowds showed up to hear Donne’s sermons, but it was unclear whether they could even hear what was being said,’ said Dr Wall. St Paul's Cross was a preaching cross and open-air pulpit in the grounds of Old St Paul's Cathedral in London . it was from Paul's Cross that Donne preached a sermon, on November 5, 1622, recreated in the recordings . John Donne was an English poet, satirist, lawyer and a cleric in the Church of England. He was an important religious and political figure in 17th century London. Due to the Reformation and its aftermath, religion and politics were inextricably linked in England during this period. As dean of St Paul’s Cathedral, Donne was a prominent man – and his sermons were often made in defense of royal policies, to the most influential crowds in the country. ‘By using the models we created for this project, we learned that the courtyard space allowed sound to reverberate, amplifying the voice of the speaker. ‘This also means the sermon had to be delivered at a measured pace to keep the speech from being garbled as the reverberating sounds overlapped.’ The reconstruction focused on Paul’s Cross, which a freestanding outdoor pulpit where crowds would gather to hear sermons on Sundays and special religious days. As dean of St Paul’s Cathedral, a focal point of social, political and religious life in the largest city in England, Donne’s sermons were often made in defence of royal policies. And it was from Paul’s Cross that Donne preached a sermon, on November 5, 1622, that is recreated by the project itself. Dr Wall and his team had to rely on historic documents and images, since the cathedral burned to the ground in 1666. They also worked with linguistics and acoustics experts to create a script and acoustic model able to simulate the way the sermon would sound depending on where you are in the churchyard.

AUDIO: How Donne's sermon would have sounded in a crowd of 5000 . ‘We actually constructed two separate models: one for visual representations and one for audio representations,’ Dr Hill said. ‘The visual model shows a greater amount of the architectural detail that is common to Gothic cathedrals. ‘The sound model has acoustical properties like reflectance and absorption assigned to the various materials, such as stone, glass or brick. ‘These are things that may not be visually apparent in the model, but they contribute to an accurate portrayal of sounds within the space.’ While researchers may never know what Donne sounded like, Dr Wall hopes his models will help recreate the experience of Londoners attending the sermons nearly 400 years ago.

Police have publicly thanked a local resident who called authorities and accurately described the serial thieves, allowing officers to track them down and put an end to the crime spree.

Good at what they do: Michael Staples, 17 (left), Nikolas Pena, 18 (right), and Stevan Bulatovic, 18 (below), are accused of stealing cash and valuables from at least 100 cars in a one-month Chicago crime spree . Chicago police say the three teens 'spent less than a minute' in each car and were capable of breaking into 12 in one night. Stevan Bulatovic (pictured) is one of the trio facing charges . Stevan Bulatovic, 18, Nikolas Pena, 18, and Michael T. Staples, 17, all of Harwood Heights, currently face one misdemeanor count of criminal trespass to a motor vehicle each, and two counts of burglary to a motor vehicle. But police say the three are responsible for more than 100 car burglaries in Chicago and across surrounding suburbs Park Ridge, Northbrook, Glenview, Niles and are looking to press further charges. Deputy Police Chief Jogmen said the young men typically targeted unlocked vehicles late at night. They moved quickly to take anything they could. The three walked away with cash, laptop computers, cell phones, cameras, GPS systems, wallets and other valuables. They would would hit up to 12 cars a night, according to police. Chicago: Police say the team of three would wait for the cover of darkness before hitting cars late at night . 'It was in and out,' said Jogmen. 'They were literally in the car for a minute or less and then they moved on to the next one - just went up the block and continued to pull on doors and when they found an open one they went inside, saw what they could take, and took it.' But it wasn't every night. 'I'm sure they took a couple days off here and there,' Jogmen said. All three were held on a $5,000 bond and are due back in court in December.","Police have arrested three teenagers in connection to a spate of car burglaries that have taken place across Chicago and its neighboring suburbs .

A Washington State judge doled out the maximum sentence of 18 years in prison to the man convicted of killing his wife in 2006 because he was bored with their sex life. 36-year-old David Pietz was found guilty of second degree murder of his 32-year-old wife Nicole last month. In his decision this morning, Judge Michael Hayden explained that he went with the maximum sentence since this was a 'close, personal and most aggravated' murder. Scroll down for video . Two decades for you: 36-year-old David Pietz was sentenced to 18 years in prison on Thursday for killing his wife Nicole in 2006 after he grew tired of their sex life . Day in court: The judge explained his maximum sentencing, saying that it was a 'close, personal and most aggravated' murder . 'She was able to look into your eyes when you did it,' he said. While Pietz was always the prime suspect in his wife's murder, he wasn't arrested until last year when foresic technology advanced to the point where they had enough evidence to arrest him. January 28, 2006: Nicole Pietz, 32, reported missing by her husbandFebruary 6, 2006: Her naked body found in the woods near Burien, WashingtonFebruary 12, 2006: Memorial service held for Nicole PietzMarch 2012: David Pietz arrested and charged with second-degree murderSeptember 12, 2013: Murder trial begins in SeattleOctober 8, 2013: Defense and prosecution rest their casesOctober 14, 2013: Jury reaches guilty verdict . 'I guess you're not quite as smart as you throught you were,' Judge Hayden said. Over the years, Nicole's mother Gael Schneider has been the main advocate for bringing Pietz to justice. But this morning, when she was finally allowed to say her peace to Pietz, she chose to forgive him. 'I've let David take my life for the last seven and a half years, but I'm not going to anymore. David, I forgive you,' she said. Pietz's parents also got an opportunity to address their son in court today. 'As his father, I love and support him. THe entire situation has been absolutely a horrible shock to us and an extremely difficult time,' his father Martin Pietz said. His mother Sandy Pietz said she still loved her son 'with all my heart'. Killed: Nicole Pietz, 32, was found dead in February 2006. She is pictured with her husband, David Pietz . During the trial, prosecutors said Pietz tried to cover up his wife's death by reporting her missing. Her nude body was found about a week later. Pietz was arrested in March 2012 by cold case detectives who had spent six years building a case against him based largely on circumstantial evidence. Mr Pietz told police that on January 27, 2006, he got home from work around midnight and briefly said goodnight to his wife, who was already sleeping, KOMO reported after his arrest. The next morning he said left for work at 8.30am without speaking to Nicole and had no contact with her throughout the day. Moving on: During Thursday's sentencing hearing, Nicole's mother Gael Scheider was allowed to confront her daughter's killer and she took the opportunity to forgive him . Mr Pietz told police that he called 911 when he went straight to a planned dinner with friends that night and his wife never arrived. He claims that she must have vanished as she headed to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting that morning where she was going to celebrate 8 years of sobriety. He claimed that he believed she had fallen back into her old drug habit. However, police said that forensic tests - including undigested food in her stomach - showed that Mrs Pietz had been killed around midnight on January 27. Loss: Investigators believe the couple was having marital problems and that Mr Pietz had cheated on his wife . Scene: Her body was found in a wooded area in 2006. Police said evidence suggested she had been killed at night - not in the day as Pietz suggested - as she still had her night mouth guard in . Search: Investigators search their home after the disappearance and remove their computer . When her body was found, she was wearing a mouth guard she only wore at night and her wedding ring was in cleaning solution in the bathroom; friends said she only took it off at night to clean it. Phone records also show her phone was allegedly used at her husband's workplace. And DNA evidence showed that Mr Pietz's was the last person to drive her car, which was found two weeks after her body in a parking lot near the University of Washington. Prosecutor Kristen Richardson later told the press that in the end, the case hinged on minor clues, including Pietz's alleged affairs with at least four different woman and his wife's mouthguard, which she was wearing when her naked body was found in a wooded area near Burien, The Seattle Times reported. During closing arguments, Richardson told the 12 members of the jury panel that Pietz had grown tired of being married to Nicole because of her reluctance to pursue a more adventurous sex life, and was 'cold and callous.’ Cover? in 2006, Pietz had appeared on television beside Schneider pleading for information in the case . In the course of the trial, four women testified they had sexual relations with Pietz while he was married to Nicole. One of the husband's alleged lovers told the court that the 36-year-old defendant regularly spiked his wife's drinks with ecstasy to get her to take part in threesomes. When he was found guilty earlier this month, Pietz showed little sign of emotion while the rest of the courthouse ran high on emotion.

A dead baby has been found entombed in a concrete-filled tub in a family's garage in Missouri. Prosecutors are now deliberating over whether to bring charges against the family in Pleasant Hill as questions remain over whether the baby was stillborn or died after birth. The grisly discovery was made when police went to the house at 6pm on Monday following a report of a stolen car. They allegedly found the vehicle parked behind the home. They then received the father's permission to search the house and found a plastic tub filled with concrete, raising suspicions, Chief Robert Driscoll said. They found the baby's body inside, he said. Grisly discovery: Police found a baby encased in concrete in a tub at this Pleasant Hill, Missouri home Monday . 'During the course of that investigation, . it led us not only to the stolen auto and to some minor drug . paraphernalia and drugs, but it also led us to a capsule that we . believed contained a body of an infant that had possibly been born . sometime in the first part of October,' Driscoll told Fox4. An autopsy is being carried out to determine if the baby was alive when he or she was born and authorities said a decision on charges would be made following the autopsy report. As investigators tried to determine whether a crime had been committed, neighbors said one most certainly had been. 'There's no reason that a baby should be put in placement of concrete in a tub. That's not a proper burial, and that's not what we all stand for,' neighbor Kurt Brent told Fox 4 Kansas City. Authorities would not say whether the baby was a boy or a girl, and neighbors said the mother had not looked pregnant. The father, who has not been identified, was briefly detained for questioning but was released. Authorities added that the family is co-operating with the investigation. Morbid: The body was found in the garage, pictured, but an autopsy has yet to determine if the child was stillborn or died after birth. Charges could be filed following the autopsy report . In further developments, it emerged that the mother has been in the hospital for several weeks, and that her four other children have been staying with grandparents, authorities said. Neighbor Rick Gleim told KSHB that the discovery had stunned the quiet neighborhood, but that they had had suspicions that not all was right at the home. Gleim said there had been many visitors at the house recently but that the the mother hadn't been seen for weeks.

The King of Belgium says his £770,000 a year allowance, handed to him after he abdicated in July, is not enough to live on. But Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo said there would be no negotiations and the money paid to King Albert II would remain the same. 'The government is not going to change one comma' of the accord thrashed out earlier this year on annual payments to the royal family, he said. 'Not enough': King Albert II reportedly says his £770,000 a year allowance is not enough to live on . 'The government has no intention, directly or indirectly, to change anything at all in this important reform.' The prime minister, whom the king had singled out for praise in his abdication address, was responding to reports Albert II felt he had been short-changed, Yahoo news said. King Albert II 'says he has not been treated as he had hoped and that he now finds himself in difficulty.' Before he abdicated this year after a 20-year reign, the King was given a tax-free alloance of £933,000-a-year to pay for the upkeep of the entire royal household. After stepping down and allowing son Philippe to take the throne, the popular monarch was handed £770,000. No chance: Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo said there would be no negotiations and the money paid to King Albert II would remain the same . He was also provided with a team of ten aides but is still 'complaining bitterly about the annual payment' said a court correspondent from Le Soir. Associates, worried by his 'poor morale and recriminations,' are trying to help him, the paper said. Several options including the government paying for his official residence or the navy running his luxury yacht which is worth about £384,000. The monarchy is an important symbol of unity in a Belgium divided between the Flemish north and French-speaking south. Belgian sculptor Delphine Boel is also trying to be recognised as the natural daughter of Albert II. As king, Albert II enjoyed immunity from the law but since he abdicated he faces court action after Boel named him in a suit to establish her true father. Her mother is Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps who, according to a book released in 1999, had an affair with Albert in the 1960s before he became king.","King of Belgium says his £770,000 a year allowance is not enough .

The video, recorded by a police cruiser's dash cam, surfaced Tuesday as Zimmerman's lawyer revealed he would no longer represent him, despite the possibility that Zimmerman could face charges resulting from the dispute with his wife. When police arrived on the scene of the argument, which had allegedly turned violent, Zimmerman was in the driver's seat of his car. Scroll down for video .

Officers approach Zimmerman, one with his gun drawn, as they prepare to handcuff him . Police ordered him out of his car and shouted for him to raise his hands, turn around and walk backwards toward them. By the time he appeared to be about 20 feet away, police shouted 'Get on your knees! Lock your feet!' Zimmerman dropped to his knees and two officers approached, one with his gun drawn, while the other handcuffed him. Then several other officers ran toward the house where the dispute allegedly took place. The video was first reported by TMZ. Mark O'Mara, who represented Zimmerman when he was acquitted of murder in the death of Trayvon Martin, made his shock announcement that he would be leaving his client as police continued their investigation into the warring couple. Police said they are now looking at an iPad belonging to Shellie Zimmerman to see if footage on the device sheds any light on the cause of their altercation in Lake Mary, Florida on Monday. It could be used to bring charges against either of the couple. The iPad captured video of the dispute but because it was smashed, it needs to be examined in a crime lab, Lake Mary police spokesman Zach Hudson said. Split: Defense attorney Mark O'Mara, left, has said he will no longer be representing George Zimmerman. They are pictured together in court in July during Zimmerman's murder trial . Shellie called 911 on Monday saying her husband had punched her father in the nose and was threatening them with a gun. But she later changed her story and decided against pressing charges. No gun was ever found and Zimmerman claimed it was his wife who was the aggressor. The spat came just days after she filed for divorce, claiming their marriage was irretrievably broken. Friends told MailOnline the argument began over claims Zimmerman had been having an affair with his ex-fiancee. On the 911 call, Shellie also claimed Zimmerman had smashed her iPad and now invetsigators say it could be crucial evidence in determining whether any charges are filed.

In a statement, Mr Vietor said the US 'remains vigilant in the face of North Korean provocations', and will work with other nations and the UN Security Council 'to pursue appropriate action' against North Korea. Japan also branded the launch 'completely unacceptable'. Russia expressed 'deep regret' over the rocket launch on Wednesday, saying the reclusive nation had violated a U.N. Security Council resolution limiting its use of ballistic technology. Russia's Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the North Korean launch had heightened instability in the region and called on other nations to refrain from further escalating tensions. 'The new rocket launch carried out by North Korea flaunts the opinion of the international community, including calls from the Russian side, and leaves us with deep regret,' it said.

North Korea has spent decades trying to perfect a multi-stage, long-range rocket. Experts say ballistic missiles and rockets in satellite launches share similar bodies, engines and other technology. This is the fifth attempt at a long-range launch since 1998, when Pyongyang sent a rocket hurtling over Japan. Previous launches of three-stage rockets were not considered successful. Leader: It is the second rocket launch from North Korea since Kim Jong Un took power after the death of his father, Kim Jong Il . Washington sees North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles as a threat to world security and to its Asian allies, Japan and South Korea. North Korea under its new leader has pledged to bolster its nuclear arsenal unless Washington scraps what Pyongyang calls a hostile policy. The UN Security Council has imposed two rounds of sanctions on North Korea following its nuclear tests, and a 2009 resolution orders the North not to conduct any launch using ballistic missile technology. The council condemned the failed North Korean launch in April and ordered seizure of assets of three North Korean state companies linked to financing, exporting and procuring weapons and missile technology. Under Security Council resolutions, nations are also barred from buying or selling weapons with North Korea, a key source of revenue for its authoritarian government. North Korea said it chose a safe flight path so debris would not endanger neighboring countries. But there are still concerns over falling debris, and Japan's defence minister issued an order to missile units to prepare to intercept the rocket if it or its fragments threatened to hit the country. Government spokesman Osamu Fujimura said that no debris hit Japanese territory. The government was still confirming if there was any damage on Japanese territory from the launch, he said. 'We had strongly urged North Korea to refrain from the launch, but they went ahead nonetheless. 'This is completely unacceptable,' he said.

They were led by a baby-faced soloist who could not help but show his passion for the music as the song continued. However, he did require the lyrics on a clipboard that he checked regularly. He was supported by six stern-looking choristers. At one stage it appears that not all of them know the words but they gamely carry on led by the moving tenor. The four-minute performance was rapturously received by the three programme presenters who were seen swaying throughout. The footage has secured new fans for the choir across the globe.

Students at a high school in Portland, Oregon, have elected a same-sex couple to its homecoming court. The biggest controversy seems to be that, according to students at the school, there is actually no controversy. Laurel Osborne and her girlfriend Sophia Schoenfeld were chosen by classmates at Cleveland High School in South-East Portland to be homecoming princess and, in a nod to equality, princess. Lesbian couple Sophie Schoenfeld (left) and Laurel Osborne (right) were elected to their homecoming court by students at a Portland, Oregon, high school . 'At first, I didn't think it was that big of a deal,' Schoenfeld told KPTV. 'I thought, ""That's cool."" But there was an article written about it and it was really cool when I noticed how much of an impact it had. A lot of teachers came up to us and said, ""Congratulations, it's a really big step.""' Each class at Cleveland High nominates six people for the homecoming court with Schoenfeld and Osborne selected as part of the senior class. Underlining the theme of inclusion, the school has no vote for homecoming king and queen. Instead, court members run a relay race to see which couple wins the titles of homecoming king and queen.

'Everyone in our class congratulated us and was super excited about it,' Osborne said of the vote. 'We were so happy to be nominated.' Cleveland High School's student newspaper The Clarion reported the most important factor in Osborne and Schoenfled's election was that 'no one made a big deal out of it... the senior class simply recognized two of their friends who were dating by voting for them as part of the homecoming court.'

It is already America's longest war, but a new draft of a key U.S.- Afghan security deal reveals plans for military forces to stay on indefinitely in Afghanistan- costing the taxpayer tens of billions. The wide ranging document, obtained by NBC News, outlines plans to stay on until 2024 'and beyond' - maintaining bases in Afghanistan and paying to support and train hundreds of thousands of Afghan security forces. Afghan officials hope that up to 15,000 American troops will remain in the country after the scheduled 2014 withdrawl date as the United States faces a never-ending war against al-Qaeda and the Taliban in the war torn nation. Endless War: US soldiers arrive at the site of a suicide attack in Maidan Shar, the capital city of Wardak province south of Kabul on September 8, 2013 . The 25-page 'Security and Defense Cooperation Agreement Between the United States of America and the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan' is to be debated in Kabul this week by 2,500 academics and tribal elders in an event known as a Loya Jirga, which is Pashto for 'Grand Assembly'. Indeed, Afghan president Hamid Karzai has said that he wont sign it without the approval of the Jirga. The draft agreement has been the result of back and forth negotiations between U.S. and Afghan officials and reveals multiple concessions and revisions. Under the new definition of relations between the two nations, Afghanistan would allow the U.S. to operate military bases, train their security personnel and to conduct counter-terrorism operations against al-Qaeda after the current mission is due to end in 2014. Afghan policemen look on they stand guard near the premises where the forthcoming Loya Jirga will be held in Kabul on November 19, 2013 . Afghan policemen guard checkpoints overlooking Kabul, Afghanistan as security in the Afghan capital is tightened ahead of a Loya Jirga . The agreement also makes provisions for the U.S. to fund and equip Afghanistan's police and security forces, because Kabul cannot afford it at the moment. The deal between the two nations would take effect on January 1st, 2015 and 'shall remain in force until the end of 2024 and beyond.' However, with two years notice from Washington or Kabul the agreement could conceivably come to an end. One issue of contention between the two nations was in the July draft stating that American troops would have to train and plan their war on terror from the security of their bases and not be allowed to travel around the country. In addition, U.S. troops would not be allowed to make arrests or enter Afghan homes. Afghanistan --- Soldiers with the U.S. Army's 1-320 Field Artillery Regiment, 101st Airborne Division shield themselves from the dust as a Medivac helicopter takes off outside Combat Outpost Nolen in the Arghandab Valley in 2010 . 'No detention or arrest shall be carried out by the United States forces. The United States forces shall not search any homes or other real estate properties,' it says. This caused consternation as high up as the President, and is described by senior defense officials as the one issue which could derail the entire deal. However, a newer draft that has been seen by the Obama administration seems to suggest that United States forces will be allowed to leave their bases and conduct full operations within Afghanistan. The question of how many troops will remain is still up for negotiation, with Afghan officials telling NBC that they hope 10-15,000 will stay. Tough Decisions: US President Barack Obama (L) visits with troops in the Dragon dining facility at Bagram Air Base on March 28, 2010 while President George W.

U.S. officials tell NBC News the number is closer to seven to eight thousand, with an additional contribution from NATO. Regardless, committing tens of thousands of troops to a minimum decade-long mission will cost the taxpayer billions. U.S and Afghan officials believe the presence of American troops in the country will help the government establish itself in the long term and reduce the chance of the country slipping back into civil war. A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council did not comment on the draft version of the agreement, but said that 'the President is still reviewing options from his national security team and has not made a decision about a possible U.S. presence after 2014.'","New U.S.-Afghan security deal proposes American troops to remain in Afghanistan until 2024 and beyond .

For four years, Norma Moore tried to get in touch with her son’s young twins, whom she hadn’t seen since he died in 2009. But this week, her battle landed her in court – after her son’s widow accused her of harassment. Mrs Moore, a 69-year-old choir singer, had spent four months waiting for the case to come to trial, but was finally vindicated when prosecutors offered no evidence at the hearing. Accused of harassment: For four years, Norma Moore had tried to get in touch with her son's young twins, whom she hadn't seen since he died in 2009 . As magistrates acquitted Mrs Moore, who was spared the indignity of standing in the dock, applause broke out in the public gallery from the dozen friends and relatives who had supported her. Mrs Moore’s solicitor said it was the first case she had heard of in her 30-year career in which a grandmother in Mrs Moore’s position had been taken to a criminal court accused of harassment. Mrs Moore has not seen her twin grandchildren since a few months before their father, Stephen, a project manager, died of bowel cancer in May 2009, at the age of 41. They are now just a few months off their tenth birthdays. After her acquittal, Mrs Moore said the fight to maintain contact with the children had devastated the health of her 74-year-old husband John, an ex-farming union secretary. She blamed the stress of their long fight – which included three run-ins with police – for a string of mini-strokes suffered by Mr Moore. Fight: Mrs Moore has not seen her twin grandchildren, pictured with parents Stephen and Lesley, since a few months before her son died of bowel cancer in May 2009, at the age of 41 . Mrs Moore said: ‘I am a loving grandmother who has never been near a police station, let alone a court before. ‘How can I be taken to court simply for trying to stay in touch with my only grandchildren? ‘It isn’t right. John and I have suffered a double loss. Not only have we had to bury our only son, but we have lost contact with our only grandchildren. ‘We don’t even know if the children realise we are still alive.’ She said the case highlighted how it was not only the parents of separated couples who could lose contact with their grandchildren. She added that she had been determined to ‘have my day in court’ on behalf of other grandparents in a similar position. Mrs Moore added: ‘Stephen assured us before he died that we wouldn’t lose contact with our grandchildren. Court appearance: Lesley Moore arrives at Worcester Magistrates Court after accusing her mother-in-law of harassment . ‘I will keep fighting for him as much as myself. Grandparents have so much to offer their grandchildren. ‘We used to pick the children up from school. We would ice cakes together and I would always make them an Easter bonnet.’ The Government has promised to address the issue, but grandparents still have no legal right to access to their grandchildren – although they do have the right to apply to the family court for leave of access. Mrs Moore said family lawyers had warned her such action could cost thousands of pounds– money she does not have. Her defence costs in the criminal case this week were covered by legal aid. The pensioner, from Tenbury Wells, Worcestershire, said she had no idea why her daughter-in-law, a part-time veterinary nurse, halted access to the children following Stephen’s death. The couple had met at school when Stephen was 17 and Lesley a year younger. Mrs Moore claimed that after Stephen died, Lesley let out their home and moved away with the children. The Moores hired a private detective, and that December he tracked Lesley down to a village near Worcester, where she was living with a new partner and the children. Lesley, 44, told police her mother-in-law was harassing her, and Mrs Moore was interviewed, but said the Crown Prosecution Service decided against any charges. The Moores began sending their grandchildren cheques in birthday and Christmas cards, first to their home and later to their school, without acknowledgement. By June last year they were so desperate to see the children they drove to their village home. Lesley’s partner called police and the Moores left after speaking to officers. West Mercia Police later wrote to Mrs Moore to advise that no further action would be taken, but warned that any future contact could ‘constitute harassment’. This June Mrs Moore was issued a summons to court. The indictment accused her of harassing Lesley through the sending of four cards or letters between December last year and March 2013. They consisted of a letter to Lesley, a letter to her partner’s mother, pleading for her help to resolve the situation, and a letter to Lesley from Mrs Moore’s lawyer. The fourth and final communication consisted of some Easter cards which Mrs Moore sent to the children’s head teacher in the hope they would be passed on. Her solicitor, Judith Kenney, said: ‘The sorry fact is a decent, law-abiding mother and grandmother was placed at risk of a criminal conviction because of one question which has still not been answered: “Why can’t she see her grandchildren?” ’ She warned that Mrs Moore and her husband will need to find a ‘fighting fund’ to take their case to the family court. Lesley Moore declined to comment on the case.","Norma Moore tried to contact her twin grandchildren for four years .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 15:45 EST, 8 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:53 EST, 8 November 2013 . Congress is gearing up for a series of votes on measures that could upend the entire Obamacare scheme, as both the House and Senate now have bills that would allow Americans to keep their health insurance policies in the face of the Affordable Care Act, no matter what. In a 2009 speech to the American Medical Association – one of many he made in defense of his insurance overhaul law – President Obama pledged that 'if you like your health-care plan, you’ll be able to keep your health-care plan, period. No one will take it away, no matter what.' Now, in the wake of Obama's public apology to millions of Americans who have received cancellation letters from their insurers despite his promises, four pieces of legislation – two in each house of Congress – are gathering steam to force the government to keep its word. It's not just anti-Obamacare Republicans who are pushing the proposals. Sen. Mary Landrieu, a liberal Louisianan who voted for the Affordable Care Act in 2009, is up for re-election in 2014. Like many Democrats who fear public anger over the law, she is moving to political redefine herself as an oath-keeper. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Civil war in the Democratic Party? Sen. Mary Landrieu (L) is pushing to rewrite a crucial part of President Obama's health care law in order to save her own political hide . Landrieu's 'Keeping the Affordable Care Act Promise Act' would gut the law's grandfather-clause section, allowing Americans to keep any insurance plan they are enrolled in by Dec. 31, 2013 . Landrieu and three other Senate Democrats – Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Mark Pryor of Arkansas – are cosponsoring the 'Keeping the Affordable Care Act Promise Act.' All four face tough re-election battles, and campaign-watchers say their group-pivot away from the White House is a matter of political survival. 'Manchin, like the others, has to watch his back,' a Republican campaign operative in West Virginia told MailOnline. 'They all understand that the longer the Obamacare mess drags on, the more their votes for it in 2009 will hurt them.' If it should become law, the Democrats' proposal would allow taxpayers to keep any individual health care plan they were enrolled in as of December 31, 2013. 'Any such coverage shall be deemed to be a grandfathered health plan for purposes of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,' the bill reads. It also guarantees that 'grandfathered' plans would, by definition, meet the Obamacare law's minimum coverage requirements. President Obama said Thursday that he's 'sorry' some Americans are losing their current health insurance plans as a result of the Affordable Care Act, despite his promise that no one would have to give up a plan they liked . The idea of grandfathered plans was a part of the Affordable Care Act that promised to protect Americans with existing health plans they wanted to keep, and the president took great pains to sell the law to the public based on that assurance. But in the wake of the law's looking implementation, insurers have mailed millions of policy cancellation notices. Most cite the Obamacare law as the reason. Senate Democrats blocked a Republican measure in 2010 that would have eliminated Obamacare's grandfather clause. GOP senators predicted at the time that it would, by design, cause as many as 69 per cent of businesses to lose thir group policies and force them to participate in government-run marketplaces instead. Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin warned at the time that 'only in the District of Columbia could you get away with telling the people if you like what you have you can keep it, and then pass regulations six months later that do just the opposite and figure that people are going to ignore it.' Obama himself has pivoted in recent days, adding a caveat to his oft-repeated 'if you like your plan, you can keep your plan' commitment that lines up with Harkin's forecast. 'If you had one of these plans before the Affordable Care Act came into law and you really liked that plan, what we said was you can keep it – if it hasn't changed since the law passed,"" he claimed on Nov. 4 during a Washington, D.C. speech to supporters. But facing a public backlash and some analysts' predictions that the number of cancelled insurance policies could swell to as many as 12 million, Obama changed tack a second time with an apology on Thursday. 'I am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me,' he told NBC News. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, another Democrat facing angry voters at home, has signed on to Landrieu's bill in order to put distance between himself and the unpopular Obamacare law . Michigan Rep. Fred Upton (L) has chaired contentious hearings about the Affordable Care Act's disastrous implementation to date, and House Speaker John Boehner (R) is expected to bring his bill to the floor soon . The Landrieu bill is not alone. A second Senate version and two separate House proposals mirror and predate hers, increasing the likelihood that one of the proposals will gain enough traction to be taken seriously, and soon. The other Senate bill, the 'If You Like Your Health Plan, You Can Keep it Act,' is co-sponsored by 38 Republicans including its author, Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson. Its approach is similar to Landrieu's, but also guarantees individuals the right to add family members to their grandfathered plans. It also protects employers as they add new employees to existing group insurance policies. The Johnson bill has a companion measure in the House, with 34 co-sponsors so far. 'More than a million Americans have been notified that the plans they like with the coverage they have chosen have been canceled,' Johnson complained. 'Millions more Americans will have the plans of their choice canceled in months to come.' Americans, he said, 'don't want ObamaCare destroying what they have and what they like.' House Energy and Commerce Committee chairman Fred Upton, a Michigan Republican, has introduced a separate measure, the 'Keep Your Health Plan Act of 2013.' It's a more streamlined bill that  extends only through the end of 2014, and would need to be renewed annually. No worries? White House Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest, with Obama on Air Force One, reassured reporters that 1 million Americans with canceled insurance policies will qualify for Medicare instead . Backup plan: Sen. Ron Johnson has his own Senate bill, and has gathered the support of most of his fellow Senate Republicans . Upton, however, has 88 co-sponsors on his side, including several members of the House leadership. The Hill reported Wednesday that House Majority Leader Eric Cantor had 'announced via Twitter that the bill would get a vote' in the coming week, but that tweet does not appear on Cantor's account. “Many Americans are now learning the sad reality that their current plan will no longer exist beginning on January 1. ... This legislation is about providing folks the peace of mind that they will be allowed to continue their current coverage if they so choose,' Upton said in a statement last week. Landrieu accompanied the president on his trip to New Orleans on Friday, and White House Deputy Press Secretary Joshua Earnest told reporters aboard Air Force One that he's open to legislative fixes like hers that address what he called a 'gap' in the law. 'The president has said for years now that he is open to working with members of Congress that have a genuine interest in trying to strengthen the Affordable Care Act,' Earnest said. 'That's been true for years now, and it’s true today.' Earnest also tried to downplay the epidemic of cancellation letters, saying that 'about a million of them' have gone to Americans 'who otherwise would qualify for Medicaid.' There's a wealth of differences between private health insurance coverage and the publicly funded Medicaid system, however: Many hospitals and doctors won't treat Medicaid patients, citing low reimbursement rates and administrative red tape involved with processing claims. Millions of Americans have lost their individual health insurance plans since the Affordable Care Act became law; a website called mycancellation.com is publishing some of the bad-news letters . Even military veterans aren't exempt from Obamacare's cancellation axe, which may affect as many as 12 million Americans who buy their medical insurance on the individual market . Landrieu introduced her bill on Monday, reading a dramatic insurance cancellation letter on the floor of the Senate. 'This is a letter that thousands of people are getting,' she said. 'and this letter never should have gone out – because we said to people if you had insurance that you like, you could keep it.' 'We didn’t say if you had insurance that you like that ... didn’t meet the minimum standards, you could keep it. We just said, and the president said over and over, if you have insurance and you like the insurance you have, you can keep it. ... That’s the single focus of my bill.","Four Dem senators push bill to 'grandfather' ALL insurance plans that are in force by December 31 .

Dale Poulin, of Waterville, was drinking whiskey and sharing hunting stories with friends when the high-powered rifle he had resting under his chin went off. The force of the bullet tore off his entire face from below the nose and scattered bone and flesh across the floor, according to police who said Mr Poulin was still conscious when they arrived. According to police Mr Poulin had . arrived at his friends' apartment with a bottle of whiskey and later . went outside to retrieve his .270-caliber rifle from his pick up truck, . thinking it was unloaded. Mr Poulin was found in a pool of . blood. His chin was on the floor and blood, teeth and skin were . everywhere according to Waterville Police Chief Joseph Massey. 'It’s one of those things where you mix . alcohol and weapons and start to do very unsafe things, and you end up . with a tragedy,' Chief Massey told the Bangor Daily News. The 31-year-old's friends tried to staunch the mass of blood flowing from Mr Poulin's head and he was still responsive when police spoke to him in the apartment. 'It was a very chaotic scene to go to, with people outside screaming,' Chief Massey said. Recovery: Dale Poulin will need reconstructive surgery . He added that the residents of the apartment were known to police but said no foul play was suspected. Mr Poulin was still sat in a chair in the home when police arrived, and had the rifle between his knees. There was a bullet hole through the cap he was wearing. After shooting through his jaw and hat, the bullet traveled through the ceiling and into an attic space. 'It was one of those cases which . clearly involved carelessness, passing a rifle around, and no one made . sure, obviously, it was not loaded,' Chief Massey said. 'Then they do something as careless as putting the rifle under their chin and pulling the trigger.' After being rushed to Maine General Hospital, Mr Poulin was airlifted to Portland for emergency surgery. 'His vital signs are good, although he will need reconstructive surgery for his facial wounds,' Mr Poulin's father, Donald, told the Portland Press Herald. He added that his son, who was not suicidal, cannot speak but has been communicating by writing on a notepad. In one note Mr Poulin, who had been out hunting earlier in the day, told his father he had accidentally dropped the rifle and hadn't realized it was loaded. 'He told me he dropped the rifle. He wrote it on the notepad. He said, ""Dad, I just dropped the rifle and it accidentally discharged"",' the victim's father told the Morning Sentinel. His son will need reconstructive surgery.","Dale Poulin recovering in hospital after shooting away jaw in accident .

The weapon was made using a 'laser sintering process' and powdered metals and based on a 'classic' 1911 design. The 3D printing specialists behind the weapon claim it 'functions beautifully' and has already handled 50 rounds of successful firing. Scroll down for video . U.S. firm Solid Concepts have made the first 3D printed gun. The weapon was made using a 'laser sintering process' and powdered metals. It is based on a 'classic' 1911 design . Every part of the gun except for the springs is made with 'direct metal laser sintering,' which makes metal parts from a 3D design by blasting powdered metal with a laser. The main body of the weapon is composed of 30 components made from stainless steel and an alloy called inconel as well as carbon fibre and a nylon hand grip. The company claims the metal laser sintering process it used is one of the most accurate additive manufacturing process available and that the 3D printed parts have more detail and are less porous than conventionally made components. The company's 'gun expert' has fired 50 rounds successfully so far using the 3D printed weapon, to prove the 3D printing technology's durability and viability to be used in modern mass manufacturing of similar products . The gun has been made by a specialist 3D printing firm based in Austin, Texas, which says: 'The successful production and functionality of the 1911 3D Printed metal gun proves the viability of 3D printing for commercial applications.' While many people might find the prospect of being able to print metal guns frightening, the firm said what it is doing is perfectly legal. 'In fact, as far as we know, we’re the only 3D Printing Service Provider with a Federal Firearms License (FFL), said Kent Firestone, Vice President of Additive Manufacturing at Solid Concepts. Every part of the gun except for the springs is made with 'direct metal laser sintering,' which makes metal parts from a 3D design by blasting powdered metal with a laser . The firm plans on using the technology to print parts for weapons. 'Now if a qualifying customer needs a unique gun part in five days, we can deliver,' Mr Firestone said. The company chose the 1911 model because the design is in the public domain, which in theory means people with access to the 3D printed technology could make a similar weapon. The equipment needed to produce such a weapon costs around £529,000. However, the Solid Concepts said it has not developed the weapon as a cheaper and easier way of making guns, but wants to prove that 3D printing is a viable solution that can be used in modern manufacturing and is here to stay. The 3D printed gun barrel sees chamber pressures above 20,000 psi every time it is fired. The company said it developed the weapon to prove the reliability, accuracy and usability of metal 3D printing . 'It’s a common misconception that 3D Printing isn’t accurate or strong enough, and we’re working to change people’s perspective,' said Mr Firestone.

'He snapped': Michael Guzzo (pictured above) went on a shooting spree before killing himself Saturday, and detectives believe barking dogs sparked the rampage . The ex-wife of the man who murdered his four neighbors and killed their two dogs Saturday because the canines wouldn't stop barking loudly, says there were warning signs he would snap. Michael Guzzo, the 56-year-old gunman, became enraged over the noise from the pets at a neighboring townhouse in a Phoenix apartment complex, detectives say. They believe the pharmacist used a pump-action shotgun to shoot dead Bruce Moore, 66; his daughter, Renee Moore, 36; her husband Michael Moore, 42 (who took his wife's last name); and their son, Shannon Moore, 17. He also slaughtered their dogs. Guzzo then fired several rounds into the door of another neighbor.He returned home and killed himself. The . woman who was married to Guzzo for 20 years described him as a . 'troubled soul' who struggled with depression, paranoia and self-esteem . issues. And she would know - she's a behavioral health nurse. The former Mrs Guzzo says she wasn't surprised when she heard the news. 'I . watched the news at 5 and I went ""Oh my God."" And I knew. I knew Mike . was the shooter, I knew he was dead,' she told AZCentral. His ex-wife  says she decided to talk to the media in order to give the . Moore family a better idea of what happened the day of the shooting, but wanted to remain unnamed. When he moved into the apartment a year and a half ago, she says he was angry and depressed. She adds that he was so angry about the neighborhood's barking dogs that he left several notes on doors around the apartment complex. Stained: Patrick Riley, brother of shooting victim Michael Moore, surveys the damage at the scene of Saturday's shooting rampage . His attitude was creeping into his professional life as well, and Guzzo was having a hard time keeping jobs at pharmacies. She also believes he was suicidal and probably woke up that morning deciding to die. The barking dogs gave him an excuxse. 'It just culminated,' she told ABC 15. 'It was the perfect storm.' She says the Moore family 'were in the wrong place at the wrong time' and argued with the wrong person. She believes her ex-husband simply 'snapped'. Still, she maintains that her Guzzo was a good person and she never felt in danger around him. She says that in the years leading up to their divorce she tried to get him treatment but he refused and started to isloate from the entire family. Remembered: A memorial has been set up outside the Moore house where three generations of the family were slaughtered when Guzzo 'snapped', allegedly due to their barking dogs . 'Mike had worth. He never felt he had worth - he had worth,' she told FOX 10. 'He was a good person that did a very bad thing.' Struggling: Guzzo's ex-wife said his mental health issues were making it hard for him to keep jobs as a pharmacist . But she says, he shouldn't have owned a shot gun. 'For him to have a weapon like that, it's just a recipe for diaster.' Several of Guzzo's neighbors say he was a quiet man and that they were shocked by his sudden violent rampage. 'I've seen him every morning - come in quiet every morning,' Donald McKenzie told KSAZ-TV. 'Never would expect him to be the guy who did this at all.' Police say they may never know for certain what prompted the massacre because Guzzo took his own life. However, they believe the altercation was the result of an argument over the Moores' dogs. Renee Moore ran a dog grooming business. Police found two of Guzzo's victims on the patio outside their townhouse. Two others were shot dead inside the home. Heavy response: Phoenix SWAT police stormed Michael Dante Guzzo's apartment following the rampage - only to find him dead by his own hand . Neighbors say they were shocked that Guzzo - a quiet man who lived alone - was capable of such violence . Witnesses described watching Guzzo stroll through the complex with his shotgun after the killings. 'When I walked outside, I saw a middle aged gentleman with a big shotgun in his hand,' Barry Hatchett told KNXV-TV. 'Had it thrown over his shoulder actually. And then he spoke to someone across the way. And what he said was, ""You didn’t think I seen you home boy?"" Then he pumped the gun and he shot it.' Libni DeLeon said the gunman knocked then fired two shots through the door. His front door is peppered with holes from the shotgun blast. Libni was not injured.

One of Britain’s most senior police officers broke ranks yesterday to admit that crime figures cannot be trusted. Mick Creedon said officers at every level are ‘inadvertently’ manipulating statistics because of the huge pressure to cut crime. The Derbyshire chief said an ‘obsession’ with measuring police performance over more than a decade has left a legacy of unwitting corruption. Statistics: Police Minister Damian Green said crime figures cannot be relied on . He was backed by other senior colleagues who said different forces are ‘inconsistent’ in how they log the trail of misery left by criminals. They said many crimes from rape to bicycle theft and criminal damage are grossly under-reported, sometimes because victims lack confidence in police. Meanwhile other fast-emerging threats such as child exploitation and abuse, as well as internet fraud and blackmail are left off official figures. Speaking at a meeting of police chiefs, Mr Creedon said levels of domestic violence and rape would soar if the ‘utter reality’ of crime was revealed. ‘Inadvertently, I think, we are still putting pressure on officers to do all they can to manipulate and create crime reductions,’ he said. ‘The truth is if we really wanted to get to get the position in crime we would see a massive increase in domestic violence. ‘It is whether we have the nerve to step away from crime reductions and the obsession with crime figures and move to a real environment where we do properly record. ‘It is sadly what is told to me by . many forces still is that everything people do everything they can to . make sure crime is not going up. ‘The consequence is another threat to integrity. This is inadvertently caused by what we have done over the past decade. ‘I don’t think they do it because they are inherently corrupt, they are doing it because the pressure is on to reduce crime.’ Mr Creedon’s unusually candid comments highlighted a rift between the Government and the highest ranks of police. They came amid reports that some forces are experiencing a rise in overall crime for the first time in many years. The Coalition says it has removed all police targets to remove red tape and enable police to be ‘single-minded crime fighters’. But . forces are still measured by their performance on key offences and . chiefs said this creates a relentless pressure to record as few crimes . as possible. Earlier this . week a serving Met officer sparked a furore when he told a Parliamentary . committee that crimes are disappearing in a ‘puff of smoke’. Accuracy: Senior colleagues of Mr Creedon said forces were inconsistent when it came to logging the trail of misery left by criminals (file picture) MPs were told official statistics are routinely massaged by officers desperate to show they are making the streets safer. At yesterday’s meeting of the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo), Police Minister Damian Green was told crime figures simply cannot be relied upon. Sir Peter Fahy, who heads Greater Manchester Police, said the drive to give frontline officer more discretion has led to different interpretations of how crimes are logged. He said: ‘We all know, essentially, that recorded crime is unreliable statistically because there are so many variations in it. ‘It is not about ‘fiddling’ figures, when you look at the more minimal type of crime there is a large field of interpretation about whether they are crimes or not.’ But Mr Green reacted angrily, telling chief constables that massaging crime figures crosses a ‘thick red line’ and is ‘straight-forwardly unacceptable’. He said that politicians don’t try and win elections by ‘fiddling the votes’ and that he is ‘surprised and disappointed’ by the claims. Asked if crime figures are accurate, Mr Green replied: ‘In most cases they are. We will be looking very carefully at what we have heard.’ The police watchdog, HM Inspectorate of Constabulary, is undertaking a review of how all forces record crime. It is expected to uncover widespread discrepancies in whether specific incidents should be categorised as a crime, and if so, what offence took place. Gwent Chief Constable Jeff Farrar, who is the national lead on crime figures, admitted performance targets have created ‘perverse incentives’. But he said in many cases officers do not record offences in the ‘public interest’, for example over a playground dispute or when a child steals from home. Other reasons for poor or inaccurate recording could ‘lack of awareness’, work pressure and professional discretion, he added. Mr Farrar said: ‘Nobody joins the police service with the intention of recording crime inaccurately.’","Mick Creedon said statistics are manipulated due to pressure to cut crime .

The three men pleaded guilty to handling . several pieces of irreplaceable antique furniture earlier this year. They were sentenced on Friday at Leeds Crown Court. Darren Webster, 46, from Leeds, was jailed for six years and six months. Carl Rutter 46, from Wakefield, was jailed for six years and Brian Eaton, 69, from Tankersley, was jailed for four years. Jailed: Brian Eaton, 69, left, Carl Rutter, centre, and Darren Webster, right, were jailed for handling antiques . The irreplaceable pieces of antique furniture, porcelain and objet d'art were stolen from Newby Hall and Sion Hill . in North Yorkshire, Lotherton Hall, West Yorkshire, and Firle Place in . Sussex in 2011. They were taken by Graham Harkin - currently serving nine years in prison. Police became aware of . the trio's involvement in the raid shortly after carrying out a drugs raid at . Webster's home in April 2011. Stolen: A pair of Louis XVI bleu nouveau ground vases, pictured, valued at £950,000 were just some of the items Webster, Rutter and Eaton had possession of . Rare: A George III Pembroke Chippendale drop leaf table valued at £500,000 was also handled by the trio . Officers searched the property and recovered a computer memory stick and SIM card which contained photographs of stolen antiques. Police then launched an operation which saw an undercover police officer approach Eaton pretending he wanted to store stolen cars. The officer then began to talk about buying stolen antiques. The officer was told by Eaton that he knew someone who stored stolen antiques - but any pieces bought would have to be shipped abroad because they were so well known. Eventually all three were arrested in September 2011. Hoard: An Ebony Veneered Bracket Clock by Daniel Delander of London circa 1710, right, and a Meissen group of the Indiscreet Harlequin valued at £180,000, left, were also recovered . The recovered antiques included a . £500,000 George III Pembroke Chippendale drop leaf table and a pair of .

An ebony veneered bracket clock by Daniel Delander of London circa 1710 was also recovered as was a Meissen group of the Indiscreet Harlequin, valued at £180,000. All items have now been returned. Jailing them, Judge James Spencer said: 'The stolen goods were extremely valuable antique items. The burglaries were committed in order to steal those items and were therefore targeted. 'He (Harkin) could not have carried out those burglaries without some prospect of disposing of them. It is because of that that the real evil of handling exists.'

Britons pay higher property taxes than any other country in the developed world, forking out around £60billion a year, a report reveals today. Charges like stamp duty, council tax, capital gains tax, inheritance tax and business rates are higher in the UK than any of the 33 other members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The taxes are worth 4.1 per cent of Britain’s economic output, compared to an average of 1.8 per cent across the OECD. In Germany, it is only 0.9 per cent. A report compiled by think-tank Policy Exchange has found Britons pay higher property taxes than any other country in the developed world . Alex Morton, of the think-tank Policy Exchange, which compiled the report, said: ‘No other developed country taxes property more heavily than the UK. ‘Yet rising house prices and falling levels of home ownership have led to many calling for an increase to land and property taxes. ‘But these issues will only be solved by genuine reform of the outdated planning system, not a tax raid on people’s homes.’ The report also criticised the Lib Dem proposal for a ‘mansion tax’ on properties worth more than £2million – as it would penalise those who live in ‘small but valuable homes’. The report is calling for radical moves to 'make it easier for people to buy their own home' with a massive increase in the number of homes built every year in Britain . It adds: ‘Some people paying will not have an income that in any way relates to the value of their property and capacity to pay the tax.’ There is a ‘strong case’ to cut back stamp duty to ‘a low and reasonably small tax’, which has been repeatedly increased by both Labour and the Conservatives since 1997. By 2018, stamp duty could be worth a record-breaking £9.4billion a year, according to the latest forecast from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility. Stamp duty used to be charged at one . per cent on all homes bought for more than £60,000. Today it is levied . at five different rates of up to seven per cent. But . has rejected any proposals for changes to the controversial tax system. Reducing stamp duty cannot be ‘the first priority’ at a time when money . is tight, it said. Concerns: The Council of Mortgage Lenders yesterday raised its fears about the Government's new Help to Buy scheme . The report is calling for radical moves to ‘make it easier for people to buy their own home’ with a massive increase in the number of homes built every year in Britain, including garden cities. Policy Exchange, co-founded by the planning minister Nick Boles before he became a Tory MP, says 1.5million new homes should be built by 2020, equal to 300,000 a year from 2015. At present, just 110,000 homes are being built every year, far below the number that are needed to keep up with people living longer, couples divorcing and immigrants needing a place to live. A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said: ‘The Chancellor has been clear there are no plans for a new house price tax on family homes.’ The Council of Mortgage Lenders yesterday raised its fears about the Government’s new Help to Buy scheme.","The taxes are worth 4.1 per cent of Britain’s economic output .

People affected claim the ban is 'ridiculous' and the Royal Mail is overreacting. Amanda Friend outside her house in the Greenthorpe area of Bramley near Leeds, West Yorkshire, where postal deliveries by Royal Mail have stopped . Residents in Greenthorpe, Leeds, have to walk over a mile and a half to pick up their mail from Bramley sorting office (pictured) Maria Lavery said: 'We've had no post for a month. It's annoying as we've not been told what is happening with no explanation from Royal Mail. 'We are fed up. My neighbour missed her birthday cards and couldn't get to collect them. I have a rottweiler which is kept under control and not allowed to roam free.' Resident Rachel Rogers claims the Royal Mail is overreacted when issuing the ban . Royal Mail have placed signs around the estate notifying people that they will not be getting mail, while residents say they are 'fed up' with the situation, which currently has no end in sight. Diane Boolemiller said: 'My older neighbours have had to collect their post. We've been told so many different things by police, the dog warden, we just want answers.' Local councillor Ann Blackburn said: 'It is a ridiculous situation and this can't go on.' Felicity MacFarlane, of the Royal Mail, said: 'Royal Mail is now formally suspending deliveries and we will be writing to affected customers. 'We apologise for the inconvenience but our priority is the health and safety of staff. They should be allowed to deliver without fear of attack.' The dog incident, believed to involve a roaming brindle terrier cross breed, understood to be from a house in the local area, is one of the 4,000 animal attacks on UK postal workers each year. Royal Mail are now seeking assurances that the dog will be secure and not roaming free. Postal workers are refusing to deliver to a housing estate because they fear tripping over crooked paving slabs, it emerged today.

Andrew Morley, 54, has owned one of the flats on Rogerstone Avenue for 10 years. He said: 'I think Royal Mail is going a bit over the top with their health and safety measures. People walk over those slabs every day and they don't fall over.' Maryfield Walk resident Mavis Poulter, 73, added: 'I manage to walk over them without tripping over every morning - and I've got a dodgy hip.

Many of the homes are now rented to leave homeowners trying to track down the landlords to see if they will pay for the repairs. Dozens of families and elderly people in the two streets will now go without any postal deliveries from November 18 unless they pay for the repairs . The affected residents are being urged to check their property deeds or consult the Land Registry. Local councillor Randolph Conteh added: 'I'm going to speak to Royal Mail about alternatives to the suspension. 'I'm concerned about ensuring there is some kind of service in place particularly for the older and more vulnerable residents.' 'The management company has written to the residents highlighting the problem areas and suggested they work with neighbours to resolve the problem. 'But really we need to all get around a table and come up with a solution together - even if that means a collection box is set up very close to the homes.' In a letter to residents, Royal Mail delivery office manager, Jagdeep Bhela, said: 'I can confirm that the area continues to pose an increasing and significant risk to my staff. 'This combined with the worsening weather conditions means it is with regret I'm writing to inform you that unless remedial repairs are completed by November 16, deliveries to your address will be suspended with effect from Monday November 18.

She's one of the last people living on a boarded-up street and she's holding up a massive £650million regeneration project. But, after living there for 30 years, grandmother Janet Capps won't budge from her home in Salford unless she's paid the market value. Now council bosses in Salford, Greater Manchester, have had to apply for a legal order to force the 55-year-old from her two-bedroom house so she can make way for the wrecking ball. Standing firm: Council officials have applied for a legal order to force Janet Capps (pictured) from her two-bedroom house . Mrs Capps, and husband David, 65, had agreed in principle to move into a new three-bedroom house nearby - one of 1,500 being built under the Pendleton PFI scheme. Negotiations stalled though over the value of their home, one of the last in Primrose Close in Pendleton, after Urban Vision, Salford council's regeneration arm, made a 'final offer' of £68,000. The couple, who bought the home for £9,500 under right-to-buy rules and have spent £10,000 doing it up, believe the house is worth £80,000 to 90,000. Mrs Capps, a supermarket worker, David, a scaffolder, are the last owner-occupiers on the condemned street not to have put pen to paper. Boarded-up: The houses in Primrose Close, Salford, where a £650million regeneration project is set to transform the area . Mrs Capps, and husband David, 65, had agreed in principle to move into a new three-bedroom house nearby before negotiations stalled over the price of their home . The 'Right to Buy' scheme has resulted in the sale of around two million council homes since the scheme was launched in 1980 under Margaret Thatcher. Initially, councils were obliged to use sales revenue to pay off debts before building new properties, which reduced the availability of council housing. Last year David Cameron proposed raising 'Right to Buy' discounts to help boost the housing market and generate finance to build new homes. Qualifying tenants must live in self-contained properties which are main homes, rented from a public sector landlord for at least five years. Those who have previously lived in a now-sold council home could also be eligible for 'Preserved Right to Buy'. Tenants are offered a maximum discount of 60 per cent for a house and 70 per cent for a flat, saving up to £75,000 on the value of their home. They will have to repay the discount if the property is resold within five years, while homes resold within ten years must be offered back to a local authority. Now council papers reveal officials . are to apply for a so-called compulsory purchase order, which would . legally require them to move if they don't reach an agreement. Mrs Capps, . a grandmother of one, said: 'Other people living here just took . whatever they were offered and moved out straight away - they were just . looking for a quick deal and some of the houses weren't in terribly good . condition. 'But we have put a lot into this house and feel it has been undervalued.' The couple expect to move into their new £125,000 three-bedroom home, partly financed by a low-interest equity loan from Urban Vision, once a deal has been reached. A Salford council spokesman said: 'Residents in the Athole Street clearance area, part of the Creating a New Pendleton project, were offered the right to reserve a new Pendleton Together home when they are completed, beginning in spring 2014. 'Additionally, support has been provided in the form of housing advice and financial compensation, including relocation equity loans to help with the move to a new home. 'All remaining occupiers on the Athole Street estate have agreed to move into the Pendleton Together new homes available from spring 2014.

A Miami Beach police officer claims he tested positive for drugs during a random test because of his use of sexual aid cream. Reinaldo Casas was fired from the Miami Beach Police Department on February 27 after testing positive for drug use. The test had been administered by Dr Ben Droblas at the Health Centre of Miami on January 15, according to an internal affairs file. Drug test: Reinaldo Casas claims his positive drug test was due to a sex aid cream that he used because his sexual prowess was failing . Casas has already had a rocky career with the police force and was reprimanded in the past for making ‘conflicting statements’, missing court appearances, ‘excessive sick time usage’, and ‘gross negligence’, according to Miami New Times. But the former cop is refusing to admit to taking drugs and has filed a grievance complaint to state his case. In the report, filed on March 13, Casas claims the test came out positive due to a sexual aid cream/gel he had taken as per his girlfriend’s advice, after his sexual prowess had been lacking. ‘I was baffled, perplexed, and confused as to how these [results] could be possible,’ Casas says in the report. He said that he had come to his conclusion that the cream was to blame after ‘heavy deliberation and the insight of others’. ‘The sexual aid cream was provided to me by a friend to assist my sexual performance,’ he stated in the report. Grievance report: The former Miami Beach cop says he was 'baffled, perplexed, and confused' over the results of the drugs test . It is unclear what lotion Casas might have been applying that would have contaminated the results of his drug test. Casas claims he was involved in a rollover crash in 2002 which had ruined 30 per cent of his memory, according to the Times. When cops looked into his claim that he'd lost 30 per cent of his memory in July 2005, they came up with nothing. They also found he had lied about whether any allegation against him had ever been sustained while he was employed at the Hialeah Police Department. Car accident: Casas claims he was involved in a crash in 2002 which has ruined 30 per cent of his memory, but an investigation showed he was lying, according to internal records (file picture) Positive: The drugs test on Casa was administered at the Health Care Centre in Miami . His conduct had been ‘highly inappropriate’, a police investigator found, and Casas was suspended for two days. In 2006, he was cited for ‘gross negligence’ and ‘gross inefficiency’ in a case involving a rental van, which he allowed a tow truck to take away, even though it had more than $1,000 worth of goods inside. Casas, who was making over $122,000 a year, according to Miami Beach Exposed, claimed ‘there was no property in the van’ when it was towed. One year later, Casas missed a court appearance saying it was because of a dental appointment, but Miami Beach Police had no record of that purported telephone call, according to internal police records.

Scott Fitzgerald - a rich debutante believed to have been the primary muse for The Great Gatsby. And now the exquite seven bedroom mansion owned by Genevra King - who shared a brief but profound fling with the celebrated author as a teen - has been listed for sale at $16.5 million. Sitting on an 8-acre belt of greenspace, the home - in Lake Forest, Illinois, north of Chicago on Lake Michigan - is said to have been Fitzergald's first taste of the good life. Indeed, in many ways it resembles the sprawling Long Island party palace he would later pen as the dome of archetypal character Jay Gatsby, complete with hardwood finishings, sprawling staircases and, most importantly, a long private wharf. So it should come as no surprise that King is considered to be the basis for the woman of Gatsby's infatuation, Daisy Buchanan. Scroll down for video . Home of Gatsby's first great love: This seven bedroom house in Lake Forest, Illinois, was the home of Genevra King, the woman that F.Scott Fitzgerald based Daisy Buchanan on in The Great Gatsby. The home is up for sale for $16.5 million . As fans of The Great Gatsby will attest, F. Scott Fitzgerald made a private wharf one of the main focal points of his story. Could this have been the one that first piked his interest? Pretty as a picture: Genevra King, a rich debutante, was the great unrequited love of F. Scott Fitzgerald. Much like the story he would wrote about iconic characters Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan, their relationship was doomed . Most recent reincarnation: Carey Mulligan played Daisy Buchanan and Leonardo DiCaprio played Jay Gatsby in the latest retelling of F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby. The home of Genevra King, the woman believed to be behind Buchanan, is now up for sale . King was born in Chicago in 1898 and met Fitzergald when she was in boarding school, according to the Huffington Post. He was a 19-year-old college student at Princeton. According to the New York Times, letters between the two - which were only unearthed in the last decade - show they were immediately smitten with each other. First love: Much like the character of Daisy Buchanan, Genevra King (pictured) dropped middle-class Fitzgerald to marry rich . 'I am madly in love with him,' King wrote in her diary one month after meeting Fitzgerald. However by January 1917, the fling was over, with King's father Charles Garfield King - who built the house now up for sale - telling Fitzgerald: 'Poor boys shouldn't think of marrying rich girls.' King would soon be engaged to a wealthy Chicago man named William Mitchell, which enraged Fitzgerald. The relationship came to represent 'not only his condemnation of the rick but his ambivalence, his fascination with wealth and his sense of inferiority around it,' according to James L. West III, author of ""The Perfect Hour,"" a book about Fitzgerald and King's romance. And so its easy to deduce that King would have inspired Buchanan, a naive, self-centered, but stunning woman, played well by Carey Mulligan in the latest retelling of the story by Australian director Baz Luhrmann. 'It's easy to see Zelda [Fitzgerald's wife] in many of his female characters, but Daisy Buchanan, in particular, has King's famous melodic voice, and Daisy's husband, Tom, is very much like King's father,' West has said. King would eventually divorce Mitchell, remarry and settle into the ornate Lake Forest abode her father built - and is now available to buy. Grand: The comely spread was built by architect Howard Van Doren Shaw . Some of the rooms, such as this one, feel as if they are straight from the pages of a F. Scott Fitzgerald novel . Green with Gatsby envy: All this could be yours for $16.5 million . The house was last on the market in 2007-09 for $4.5 million. The exponential rise in value has less to do with the Gatsby link and more to do with the acquisition of a neighboring farm. The property is measured at 45 acres. Ont op of that is the original King estate, which was measured as a 7,424-sqaure-foot home and an 8-acre belt of green space. It is not known whether Fitzgerald - who would later in life refer to King as 'the love of my youth' - ever visited the property. In 1954, Chicago businessman Frank Reilly and his wife, Antoinette, bought the Kingdom Come Farm property from its third owners.

"By . Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 00:37 EST, 20 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 00:37 EST, 20 November 2013 . A sharply divided Supreme Court on Tuesday allowed Texas to continue enforcing abortion restrictions that opponents say have led more than a third of the state's clinics to stop providing abortions. The justices voted 5-4 to leave in effect a provision requiring doctors who perform abortions in clinics to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. The court's conservative majority refused the plea of Planned Parenthood and several Texas abortion clinics to overturn a preliminary federal appeals court ruling that allowed the provision to take effect. Not in favor: The US Supreme Court ruled Tuesday it will not stop Texas from enforcing restrictive abortion laws . The four liberal justices dissented. The case remains on appeal to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans. That court is expected to hear arguments in January, and the law will remain in effect at least until then. Justice Stephen Breyer, writing for the liberal justices, said he expects the issue to return to the Supreme Court once the appeals court issues its final ruling. The Texas Legislature approved the requirement for admitting privileges in July. In late October, days before the provision was to take effect, a trial judge blocked it, saying it probably is unconstitutional because it puts a 'substantial obstacle' in front of a woman wanting an abortion. But a three-judge appellate panel moved quickly to overrule the judge. The appeals court said the law was in line with Supreme Court rulings that have allowed for abortion restrictions so long as they do not impose an 'undue burden' on a woman's ability to obtain an abortion. Writing for the appeals court, Judge Priscilla Owen noted that the Texas law would not end the procedure, only force women to drive a greater distance to obtain one. Pleased: Texas Governor Rick Perry praised the decision, selling it as a protection for women from 'shoddy' abortions . Justice Antonin Scalia, writing in support of the high court order Tuesday, said the clinics could not overcome a heavy legal burden against overruling the appeals court. The justices may not do so 'unless that court clearly and demonstrably erred,' Mr Scalia said in an opinion that was joined by Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy did not write separately or join any opinion Tuesday, but because it takes five votes to overturn the appellate ruling, it is clear that they voted with their conservative colleagues. Planned Parenthood and several Texas abortion clinics said in their lawsuit to stop the measure that it would force more than a third of clinics in the state to stop providing abortions. After the appeals court allowed the law to take effect, the groups said that their prediction had come to pass. In their plea to the Supreme Court, they said that 'in just the few short days since the injunction was lifted, over one-third of the facilities providing abortions in Texas have been forced to stop providing that care and others have been forced to drastically reduce the number of patients to whom they are able to provide care. Already, appointments are being canceled and women seeking abortions are being turned away.' Mr Breyer said the better course would have been to block the admitting privileges requirement at least until the court issued its final ruling because some women will be unable to obtain abortions. Also in favor: Michael Benavides of Austin holds up a crucifix July 1 and leads a group of pro-life supporters into the Texas State capitol . If courts ultimately find the law is invalid, 'the harms to the individual women whose rights it restricts while it remains in effect will be permanent,' he said. The five justices and three appeals court judges who sided with Texas are all Republican appointees. The four dissenting justices are Democratic appointees. U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel, who initially blocked the provision, is a Republican appointee. Texas Gov. Rick Perry, a Republican, praised the Supreme Court action. 'This is good news both for the unborn and for the women of Texas, who are now better protected from shoddy abortion providers operating in dangerous conditions.' 'As always, Texas will continue doing everything we can to protect the culture of life in our state,' Mr Perry said.Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said the groups will continue the legal fight: . 'We will take every step we can to protect the health of Texas women. This law is blocking women in Texas from getting a safe and legal medical procedure that has been their constitutionally protected right for 40 years.' Also in favor of the decision: Even children protested in favor of more restrictions on abortion . 'This is outrageous and unacceptable - and also demonstrates why we need stronger federal protections for women's health. Your rights and your ability to make your own medical decisions should not depend on your ZIP code,' Ms Richards said. Tennessee and Utah are the other states enforcing their laws on admitting privileges. Similar laws are under temporary court injunctions in Alabama, Kansas, Mississippi, North Dakota and Wisconsin. In Texas, 12 abortion providers say they have attempted to obtain hospital privileges for their doctors, but so far none of the hospitals have responded to the requests. That means those clinics can no longer offer abortions, leaving at most 20 facilities open in a state of 26 million people. All of those facilities are in metropolitan areas, with none in the Rio Grande Valley along the border with Mexico. Currently, only six out of 32 abortions clinics in Texas qualify as ambulatory surgical centers, and some have doctors who do not meet the admitting privileges requirement. Texas women undergo an average of 80,000 abortions a year.","Texas abortion restriction have cut the number of eligible abortion clinics by one-third .

A masked robber has been jailed after being caught on CCTV threatening a terrified shop worker with a spear gun. Nikolas McGregor demanded cash from Patricia Murphy during a hold-up at a busy Co-Op store in Hamilton, North Lanarkshire. Shoppers fled in terror as the 24-year-old armed himself with the weapon - normally used to kill fish. Raid: Nikolas McGregor (pictured) holding up the Co-operative store in Hamilton, North Lanarkshire, with a spear gun . But McGregor fled empty handed when a brave security guard challenged him and police later caught him hiding in a garden. McGregor was locked up for four years and two months at the High Court in Glasgow after he admitted to a charge of attempted robbery. A judge told him he had been involved in a 'distressing and frightening' incident. CCTV footage played in court showed McGregor strolling into the Co-Op in Mill Road, Hamilton, on August 17 this year. His face was covered with a wooly balaclava and he wore a bright red tracksuit and a flourescent builder's vest. McGregor soon brandished the spear gun at worker Miss Murphy and told her: 'Open the f****** till or I will use this.' McGregor running into the story. He was sentenced at the High Court in Glasgow to four years and two months . Some customers raced out of the store while Miss Murphy could be seen crying as she cowered behind the till. Security guard William Russell challenged McGregor, who threatened to shoot him before trying to strike him with a vodka bottle. McGregor eventually ran out before police - including a firearms unit - went on the hunt to find him. He was discovered that day hiding in a garden swigging from a can of beer - claiming he was waiting for his girlfriend. The spear gun and clothes he had worn during the raid were found in a nearby bin. It emerged the weapon was not in working order and could not fire although staff at the Co-Op did not know that. The court heard a traumatised Miss Murphy only returned to work last month. Gerry Considine, defending, said drug dealers had threatened to kill McGregor the day before the raid due a debt that he had built up. Mr Considine said McGregor, of Scotstoun, Glasgow, then 'foolishly' decided to rob the shop to get cash. Lord Bannatyne told McGregor: 'This serious offence involved the use of a spear gun - the fact it could not be fired makes no difference. 'This was a very distressing and frightening experience (for Miss Murphy) and this has had a very significant effect on her.'","Nikolas McGregor held-up a store in North Lanarkshire .

Killed: Schoolboy Radwan Uddin, nine, was playing with his brother when he was struck by uninsured driver Ibrahim Waseem, 23 . An uninsured driver who killed a nine-year-old boy playing on his bike with his older brother has been jailed for 21 months. Ibrahim Waseem, 23, was driving at nearly double the speed limit when he struck schoolboy Radwan Uddin, who was riding on the handlebars of his older brother’s bicycle, near a park. In the force of the crash, the nine-year-old was thrown into the windscreen of the silver Mazda and up into the air, before he landed in the middle of the road. Snaresbrook Crown Court heard that Marks & Spencer worker Waseem then hit a parked black Peugeot so hard it was hurled 20 feet down the road. Paramedics rushed to the scene and Radwan was taken to Great Ormond Street hospital. However he suffered catastrophic head injuries and died soon after. The court was told that Waseem got out of his Mazda 3 and ran away, but was chased to his nearby home. He then called a solicitor, and turned himself in to Freshwater police station that evening. Waseem sobbed throughout his police interview and said he thought he was going at 20-25mph when he hit the bike in East Ham, east London. In fact his speed was a minimum of 39 mph in the 20mph zone, the court was told. Waseem, of East Ham, London, admitted causing death by careless driving following the incident on June 26, 2012. He claimed he had become a recluse since the incident and only manages to get out to go to his job at Marks & Spencer. Sentence: Waseem was jailed for 21 months after he admitted causing death by careless driving at Snaresbrook Crown Court, pictured . Judge Judith Hughes QC said: ‘This is far from an easy case in which to sentence because it is a tragedy for you and a tragedy for the victim’s family. ‘Clearly things can be said on both sides and it will not help the family to hear that the child was on the handlebars and that the older brother had been going down the road the wrong way. ‘But unfortunately the fact is that you Waseem were going too fast and if you had been going less quickly the consequences might have been different. ‘Clearly the speed and having no insurance are aggravating features but I accept you are extremely remorseful and take full responsibility for what has happened.’ Judge Hughes sentenced Waseem to 21 months in prison and disqualified him from driving for at least 12 months until he passes another driving test.","Motorist Ibrahim Waseem was driving at 39mph in 20mph zone .

A Texas nurse accused of shooting dead a young mother and abducting her newborn son last year avoided a possible death sentence by pleading guilty Tuesday and accepting a sentence of life without parole. Verna McClain, 32, was awaiting trial on a capital murder charge for fatally shooting the new mother outside a pediatric clinic in the Houston suburb of Spring and snatching her 3-day-old son. Montgomery County prosecutors had said they would seek the death penalty against McClain for the April 2012 slaying of 28-year-old Kala Golden-Schuchardt. Plea deal: Verna McClain, pictured in April . 2012, pleaded guilty to murdering a new mother and abducting her . 3-day-old son last year, and accepted a life sentence .

The infant was found hours later safe . with McClain's sister, who told authorities McClain, a mother of three, . intended to adopt the child. Investigators . and McClain's relatives said she had a miscarriage and was obsessed . with the idea to find a baby to pass off as her own. Montgomery . County District Attorney Brett Ligon said he had promised . Golden-Schuchardt's family that McClain would die in prison either by . lethal injection or by never being free again. Tuesday's plea agreement provided finality and meant the family no longer would have to come to court, he said. ‘The . victim's family got to hear what few in their place do, an admission of . guilt,’ Ligon added. ‘No games were played.

Tuesday before State District Judge Kelly Case dressed in a pink and . white striped jail suit. She said little, providing one word ‘yes’ and . ‘no’ answers in response to the judge's questions. One of her attorneys, Tyrone Moncriffe, said McClain is remorseful. ‘It was a tragedy,’ he said. ‘She just feels sorry for the family.’ Authorities . said McClain was waiting outside a pediatrician's office north of . Houston. Witnesses said she repeatedly shot Golden-Schuchardt, then . grabbed the child from her truck and drove away.

Our thoughts are with Jannine's family and friends during this extremely difficult time.’ The picture of happiness: Family and neighbors said the family seemed perfectly normal . Relatives were mortified by the sudden death of the outwardly happy couple. ‘Jannine was the sweetest person in the world,’ her brother-in-law told the Post. ‘You couldn’t have picked a worse person for something like this to happen to.’ The Parisis were married for two decades, he added. Shocked neighbors spoke of how the family was always outside running, playing basketball or spending time together. One neighbor called the Parisis were 'a wonderful family' when speaking to WTOP. 'We socialized with them - just all-around nice people. It's a shame,' the neighbor added. ‘It's a little shocking to think it happened right around the corner,’ neighbor Bob Young told the Post. ‘It's pretty tough. Hopefully the kids are OK. I'm not sure what's going on in the house.’ ‘My girls played basketball with their youngest daughter,’ another neighbor told NBC Washington. One neighbor sang a different tune to CBS Washington, one that painted a much darker picture of the family. ‘I didn’t know there was any problems going on in that house until a couple of months ago when there was an ambulance and police officers,’ said Jinnie Maluff. ‘I feel really bad about it because maybe we could have done something to be of more support, she added. Another neighbor told the Post of how despite living next door to the Parisis, he had no idea the family was unhappy. ‘You are so busy in your own life that you don’t find out about your neighbor’s issues, you just wave and say ‘Hi.’","Paul and Jeannine Parisi were found dead early Wednesday morning in their Virginia home .

An elaborate planning application for a £5.5m seven-bedroom mansion is expected to be given the go-ahead by council officials, even though the owners spend most of their time abroad. The plans for the 'Iceberg Home' underneath the property in Wimbledon include a gym, home cinema, games room and sauna, as well as an adjoining glass tunnel which will lead to a swimming pool pavilion at the bottom of the garden. The controversial application has been 'highly recommended' by planning officials at Merton Council, despite the fact the owners only spend part of the year in the house, splitting their time between the UK and Switzerland. Aerial view: The 'Iceberg Home' would extend into the garden of the Wimbledon mansion (highlighted in red) Luxury: Plans for the house in London include the construction of a gym, cinema and sauna . A residents association in Wimbledon Village have condemned the plans fearing the construction would cause constant noise and could encourage others in the area to take on similar projects. The Parkside Residents Association said . with basement conversions becoming increasingly popular, giving rise to . so-called 'Iceberg Homes', the borough council must be vigilant and ensure there . is 'robust supervision' of all the submitted applications. Sue Cooke, chairwoman of the association, said: 'This has been happening in Kensington and Chelsea for some time now. There are now limits to how deep you can build. 'It is just that suburban authorities have not seen it so much. 'We . don't object to the principle of the basement under the garden, but if . this is allowed without adequate supervision it will set a precedent to . others. 'Most of these houses are more than 100 years old and construction could impact on neighbours' houses. 'There are conditions in the application which normally have to be met for permission to go ahead, but no recommendations have been made. 'For example, the document says permission will be granted if noise from the ventilation is kept to a minimum, but it does not say how it can be done. 'The system should not work like that. Plans: The tunnel, drawn at the bottom of the sketch, would be 88ft long and would require the whole rear garden of the property to be excavated . The owners of the property are . attempting to excavate almost their entire garden and build an enormous . extension underneath. They . were granted planning permission to build a swimming pool in February . 2012, but have now upgraded their plans to include the enormous underground . structure. Even though . they currently spend part of their lives abroad, they are expected to . move back into the property permanently when the building work is finished. The glass-covered link between the existing house and the pool pavilion would be 88ft long and 11ft wide. A . path leading from the house to the pool pavilion would be constructed . above the underground tunnel and grass would be re-seeded on the surface. The proposals are set to be accepted despite planning permission being refused for a similar swimming pool pavilion to be built in February 2011. The plans were rejected on the grounds the structure would be 'detrimental to the character and appearance of the locally listed building and that the pool building was of excessive height.' The application concluded by saying: 'The proposed pool pavilion and associated basement link and provision of a basement beneath the existing house is considered to be acceptable in design terms and the proposal would preserve the character and appearance.' Merton Council were approached for comment but said they would not comment before the decision is made.

A cash-strapped council has been attacked for installing expensive bins that cost £5,000 each, provide free wifi and send a text message when they're full. Ceredigion County Council in west Wales, which must make £9.5million in cuts by 2015, is under fire after setting up five 'Big Belly' solar-powered bins in seaside locations at a time when it is cutting teaching jobs, and has to dig deep even to fund public toilets. The hi-tech 'compacter' bins use energy from the sun to crush waste put inside it, which its makers claim gives it between six and eight times the capacity of a regular bin. Scroll down for video . Hi-tech: Pedestrians make use of the new Big Belly bin in Aberystwyth town centre . They are leased from the manufacturers for around £1,000 a year, and have been set up to tackle a litter problem in seaside areas with grant money from the Welsh Government. Councils in Somerset and London have already trialled the devices. It has been claimed the bins will save more than three times as much as they cost, but local people have attacked them as a waste of public money that could be better-spent elsewhere. In Aberaeron, one of the towns which now has a Big Belly, local representatives complained that the money could be better-spent keeping public toilets open. Councillor Mair Harrison said: 'We have to pay £4,000 to keep our public toilets open yet they are spending £5,000 on a bin. 'I know it is different funding pots but it’s still public money.' However, according to claims by CSG Asset Management, which distributes the bins in the UK, the bins will in fact the council money by reducing how often collections need to be made. The devices, which cost £21 per week each to lease, are said to save £77, reduce the number of bin collections needed by more than 70 per cent and scare off vermin. As the bins do not leave their rubbish exposed to the elements they are also said to cut the number of pests, as well as the problem of overflowing. The ability of the bins to text and email when they are full is also said to eliminate 'milk-round' stye collections, as collectors will only need to empty the bins when they know they are nearly full. A Welsh Government spokesman said: 'Bins in coastal towns, especially Aberystwyth, Borth, Aberaeron and New Quay, experience heavy use during the tourist season. 'Much of the litter is fast food litter that is bulky and attracts seagulls and rats. The innovative Big Belly Bins compress the litter using solar power. The bins can hold six to eight times more waste than the average bin. Pilot: One of the bins has been installed by the Clock Tower in Aberystwyth, pictured . 'The bins also eliminate smells and do not attract vermin. The bin will send an email and text when it has reached 85 per cent capacity. 'This means it can be emptied when needed rather than having to empty bins on a ‘milk-round’ type basis.' The Council has been under fire recently for implementing spending cuts, including one of £210,000 to school budgets, which will cost five teachers their jobs. Budget announcements last month revealed that Ceredigion would lose almost £5million in funding. The council's leader said at the time that the cut was 'unprecedented' and would prompt tough choices. Welsh councils have faced less pressure in the past years to save money than English counterparts, and have kept the ability to hike council tax by as much as 5 per cent a year to make ends meet. Ceredigion has increased council tax by 3 per cent per year every year since 2011, which has helped it to avoid making the severe cuts seen elsewhere. But in the Welsh Government's draft budget this year it was made clear that councils would have to make significant savings. Ceredigion was given a 4.6 per cent cut, roughly £5million. Taking inflation and existing spending plans into account, it will have to make £9.5million of cuts in the next tax year to balance its books. The change will be even more severe after the rural council's share of central government funding was revised down due to its declining population. When the cuts were announced, council leader Ellen ap Gwynn said: 'We will have to make some very difficult decisions over the next few months as we try and minimise the impact on the existing services, and we must accept that some services will need to be reduced or even cut.' The council is still deciding exactly what will be done to make the savings, but it has been suggested that libraries, refuse collection and public toilets will be in the firing line.

The Swiss national failed his first year and must now pass resits to carry on studying at the university. The 20-year-old has advertised for a Cambridge graduate to coach him through his Natural Sciences exams. He is willing to pay the right candidate £100-an-hour for the one-off fixed-term contract. Job advert: A Swiss student at Cambridge University is looking for a biochemist to tutor him for 16 weeks as he attempts to pass his first year exam resits . Applicants must have an 'excellent degree' from Cambridge and possess 'superb' scientific knowledge. They must also be a non-smoker who leads 'a physically active lifestyle' and is 'healthy and fit'. The live-in tutor will be required to work six hours a day, five days a week for sixteen weeks to help the undergraduate, who has ADHD and dyspraxia. Successful candidates are also expected to socialise with the student - and help him integrate into student life. They will be get an en-suite guest room in the student’s Cambridge accomodation complete with parking space. They may also have to travel with the student on expenses-paid trips to Zurich. The advert asks for an 'excellent tutor and at the same time an inspiring mentor' who boasts a 'sunny disposition'. The student failed his first year at Cambridge by just 0.3 per cent and is retaking two out of four exams. He has been told he may rejoin the course if he gets at least 50 per cent in both exams. The advert was posted on Tutors International yesterday, but manager Victoria Gibbs said it was too soon to expect any applications. Undergraduate: The student will pay the tutor £48,000 for 16 weeks of tuition. The timetable will include around 30 hours work each week, the advert said . It says the applicant should be: 'engaging, have a good sense of humour and a sunny disposition. 'Naturally, he or she is expected to be an excellent tutor and at the same time an inspiring mentor for the positive as well as progressive development of the student’s career in Cambridge. 'The Tutor must devise and implement a full timetable which ensures a thorough understanding of all of the material in the entire syllabi of both target subjects, allows for constant revision of the material covered, and includes thorough exam preparation through regular mock tests and exam questions.

'This is a demanding role, and it is anticipated that he (and the Tutor!) would both benefit from the opportunity to unwind through a sport such as rowing, or regular trips to the gym, cultural excursions are encouraged though by no means necessary.' The student, who speaks six languages, is described 'polite' and 'friendly' who will prove 'a pleasure for a capable educator to work with' because of his 'natural intelligence.' Ms Gibbs said: 'This was one of the more niche jobs we have had.' Despite winning a place at Cambridge - ranked as third best university on the world - he requires help with time management, organisational skills, memory skills, exam techniques, reading strategies, structuring revision summaries and essay-writing, proof-reading, and managing his attention and focus. The post is the second unusual job advert on Tutors International’s website. An Arab businessman in his 30s offered £122,000-a-year to a tutor to turn him into an English speaking, piano playing, opera loving student worthy of a place at Oxford University.

The . young man is a very intelligent Swiss student who was brought up in a . multi-cultural family and is fluent in six languages. Revision role: The Cambridge University student's tutor will also be expected to 'unwind' with him by playing sport . Although he has . been aware of various difficulties in his learning, his natural . intelligence and excellent work ethic have so far been enough to carry . him through his academic career.

But city officials are hoping Palin's role in history will bring out fans willing to pay a lot more. 'We put it out there to get a better return on taxpayer dollars by listing it as her car than just selling it 'as-is,' Public Works Director Archie Giddings said Wednesday. 'It may have some value to somebody... knowing who had it originally.' Only two bids had been submitted as of Thursday morning. The listing expires Nov. 27 at midnight Alaska Standard Time. Palin drove the vehicle during her second term as mayor, which ended in October 2002.

The cardboard cutout of her used for the eBay photo was borrowed from the local Chamber of Commerce, which has the life-size image on display for visitors, Giddings said. After her stint as mayor, Palin went on to become Alaska's governor and Republican presidential nominee John McCain's running mate in 2008. She resigned as governor in 2009, about halfway through her first term. Palin's mayoral vehicle was used by other city workers after she left office. Like other old city vehicles that become surplus, any money earned from the sale of the Expedition would go toward replenishing the city's vehicle replacement fund, Giddings said. According to the eBay listing, the SUV is in storage and needs new brakes, wheel seals and an idle air control valve. The listing says the vehicle is being sold 'as-is,' with no warranty.","There have so far only been two bids on the SUV since Monday - listing expires Nov. 27 .

Staff also treated other animals, including the macaque monkeys, who clambered all over their pumpkin and used it like a swing. The pumpkins were given to red pandas and anteaters, one of which used its elongated snout to investigate. Keeper Ian Turner said: 'It’s become something of a tradition for us to have a competition to see which members of staff can come up with the best carved pumpkin. 'For the animals, the pumpkins’ appearance was of a lot less interest than what was inside as we had hidden a variety of treats within them.

His wife Marion has been charged with his murder . The wife of a GP has been charged with murder after her doctor husband was found stabbed to death at their £700,000 home. Marion Hughes, 58, who is accused of killing Dr Geraint Hughes, appeared before Truro magistrates this afternoon. Dr Hughes, 60, was found dead in the coastal village of Feock, Cornwall, last Friday . Officers said they found the body of a man with stab wounds to the chest and he was pronounced dead shortly afterwards. Mrs Hughes also suffered injuries and was taken to hospital but police said her wounds were not life-threatening. A Devon and Cornwall Police spokesman said: 'Marion Hughes, aged 58 from Feock, near Truro has been charged with the murder of Dr Geraint Hughes.' Mrs Hughes appeared at court for a preliminary hearing and was remanded in custody. She will appear at Truro crown court on March 20 for a plea and case management hearing. Mr Hughes, also known as Gary, was a GP in the Camborne and Redruth area of Cornwall. Detective Inspector Ben Beckerleg of Devon and Cornwall Police said: 'An investigation has now begun to fully understand the circumstances and events leading up to this man's death.' Villager Cynthia Vanstone said: 'He was a lovely doctor. He was willing to help anyone'. Dr Hughes, who qualified in 1977, was a senior partner at the Clinton Road NHS surgery in Redruth, Cornwall.

Probe: Police have sealed off Dr Hughes' property in Feock, where he was found with stab wounds last Friday . In a tribute released by police, Dr Hughes’ family described him as a 'devoted father'. 'We are devastated by the tragic loss of our devoted and caring father,' the statement said. 'He was always there for us and we cannot believe he is gone.' Dr Hughes, who had two sons, had continued a proud family tradition by following both his parents to become a GP. His late mother treated the survivors of the infamous Belsen concentration camp at the end of World War II. Dr June Hughes, who died in February last year at the age of 91, started her medical training in 1939 and was called up to serve as an Army doctor in 1944. After the war she became one of the first female doctors in Cornwall and married fellow GP Edward Hughes. They both worked as family doctors in picturesque villages around Truro from Chacewater to Feock. The family home at Feock was used as a medical practice from 1962 and Dr Hughes and her husband carried out weekly surgeries in nearby St Day and Ponsanooth.

Oxford-educated pianist Robin Zebaida pictured outside Isleworth Crown Court is accused of groping a 15-year-old girl while 'French-kissing' her mother . An internationally renowned concert pianist seduced and 'French kissed' a love-struck fan on his sofa while simultaneously fondling her 15-year-old daughter, a court heard today. Oxford-educated Robin Zebaida, 49, had an arm around each of them after plying the pair with alcohol at his London home. Isleworth Crown Court was told how the musician, who is a graduate of the Royal College of Music, groped the teenage girl while  embracing her mother. The widow and her daughter met Zebaida in the summer of 2011 while he performed during a Mediterranean cruise. 'The mother and the defendant became friendly with each other and made arrangements to meet in England and some sort of romantic attachment may have grown as far as the mother and the defendant were concerned,' a jury heard. The pair had travelled from their Essex home to Steinway studios in west London and to the Imperial War Museum, where the pianist who is also a certified masseur, claims to have given the girl an 'innocent' back-rub over her clothes. They met for a third time at his north-east London home last November when the alleged incident took place. 'We sat on the sofa and he put some . music on and we had some alcoholic drinks,' said the woman who cannot be named for legal reasons. 'My daughter had one or two vodka miniatures and I think he had some . whiskey. 'He had an arm around each of us and he kissed me, which turned into a French kiss,' she said. 'It was a bit of a surprise. 'He had an arm around my waist and an . arm around my daughter’s back and French kissed me several times within . bouts of conversation.' The jury heard how the woman and her daughter shared a sofa-bed in Zebaida's apartment that night, though the 15-year-old pleaded with her mother to leave. 'She told me his hand had been under her shirt and against her stomach.' A court heard how Robin Zebaida (right) pictured with his QC Sir Ivan Lawrence (left) plied the pair with alcohol before the alleged incident at his north-east London home . The pair left early the next morning, despite the defendant allegedly asking them to stay. 'He said we should stay longer and began cuddling me and started undoing my bra,' added the girl's mother. Three months later, the teenager told a counsellor about the alleged incident and police were informed. Prosecuting Mark Gadsden told the jury: 'Mr Zebaida, as he brought his hand down on the girl's hip, put his hand under the top she was wearing on her bare flesh.' 'He stroked her there and moved his hand up to her breast, where her bra was, but did not touch her breast. 'He started kissing the mother, ""smooching"" as the daughter described it, French kissing. The trial continues at Isleworth Crown Court in Hounslow, west London . 'The daughter then lay on the floor complaining of the effects of the alcohol the defendant plied them both with. 'She had been drinking miniatures and consumed more than the adults. 'He coaxed her back on to the couch and caressed her thigh and bottom in a slow and deliberate way.' The court heard how Zebaida also kissed the girl's neck in a way that she felt 'unable to stop happening.' Zebaida also teaches music master classes around the world with the British Council, and is an examiner with the Associated board of the Royal Schools of Music. British-born Zebaida pleaded not guilty to one count of sexual assault by touching. The trial continues.

The best place for a life free from health worries has been revealed as the wealthy home counties around London, according to a new report. The findings from the Office of National Statistics also reveal a stark north, south divide with disabled people living in the north finding they are more constrained in their daily lives than those living in the wealthier south east. The report shows that, for example, people living in the more deprived north west of England were three times more likely be negatively impacted by disabilities or health issues. The percentage of residents with day-to-day activities 'limited a lot' was strongly related to the level of deprivation experienced by the authorities, the report warned . Meanwhile just one in 20 people living in the affluent counties of Surrey, Buckinghamshire, Hampshire and Oxfordshire claimed they were hampered by health issues in their day-to-day lives, according to the ONS. Elmbridge in Surrey is home to the fewest number of people whose lives are confined by illness or disability - where just 4.9 per cent of the population describe themselves as 'limited a lot', the ONS said. In comparison, around 16 per cent of residents in Knowsley, Merseyside, described themselves as 'limited a lot' in carrying out normal day-to-day activities. The figures echo another set of statistics exploring live expectancy across the country. It showed that residents of wealthy southern counties could expect to remain well and active for as much as 18 years longer than people in England’s poorest boroughs. Exclusive Elmbridge, dubbed ‘Britain’s Beverley Hills’ has claimed the title of the best place to live for a good quality of life on four separate occasions in 2006, 2008, 2009 and 2010. Elmbridge in Surrey is home to the fewest number of people whose lives are confined by illness or disability . The report states: 'There is significant inequality across local authorities in England with almost three times as many people in Knowsley, Merseyside, reporting that their activities were 'limited a lot' compared to Elmbridge, Surrey. 'The percentage of residents with day-to-day activities 'limited a lot' was strongly related to the level of deprivation experienced by the authorities' residents. 'The 10 authorities with the lowest rates were the same authorities for males and females. 'These authorities were among the least deprived in England, located in the commuter belts of Buckinghamshire, Hampshire, Oxfordshire and Surrey and having extensive rural and semi-rural populations.' The ONS also noted significant variations across Wales. Across England and Wales, 9.6 million people reported their day-to-day activities were limited in some way because of a health problem or disability . In Monmouthshire, 9 per cent of the population describe themselves as 'limited a lot' compares to 17 per cent who live in Merthyr Tydfil. Overall, 12 per cent of residents of Wales reported their day-to-day activities as 'limited a lot' compared to less than 9 per cent of people in England. In total around a fifth of the population of England and Wales -  9.6 million people - reported their day-to-day activities were limited in some way by issues relating to their health. But less than half of these, just 46 per cent, described themselves as 'limited a lot.' The report, collated from 2011 Census data, states that most people will experience some sort of illness or impairment at some point in their lives. While some people's day-to-day activities such as socialising, going to work and living independently will not be affected, other impairments restrict activities such as employment, accessing services independently, and performing self-care tasks. The report also found health problems . were far more common among younger people in more deprived parts of the . country and said the findings could suggest variations in access to . effective health care in different areas.","People living in London's commuter belt are the least likely in England to be limited by health problems or disability .

Chitty Chitty Bang Bang has captured many a child's imagination, but a new all-terrain vehicle that can fly is definitely a toy for grown-ups. A British engineering firm has unveiled an flying 'car' that is a quick as a Porsche but can also take to the air. The SkyRunner is being billed as 'part buggy, part aircraft' and claims to be the 'ultimate recreational vehicle'. Scroll down for video . A British engineering firm has unveiled the 'SkyRunner' that is a quick as a Porsche but can also take to the air. It is described as 'part buggy, part aircraft' and claims to be the 'ultimate recreational vehicle' Maximum Road Speed: 115mph . 0-60mph: 4.3 secs . Maximum Air Speed: 55mph . Takeoff Speed: 37mph . Cruise Speed: 35mph . Maximum Altitude: 15,000ft . Restricted Altitude: 10,000ft . Range: 200miles . Weight: 420kg . It is powered by a one litre Ford EcoBoost engine that provides 123 brake horsepower and 147lb/ft of torque, which gives the unusual vehicle a 0-60mph time of just 4.3 seconds - the same as a mid-range Porsche 911. However, the buggy would lag behind in a drag race against the more traditional German sports car, as its top speed of 115mph is considerably slower than the Porsche. When in the air, the 'car' uses paraglide technology to reach a maximum altitude of 15,000ft, although it is restricted to 10,000ft or 3,000 metres, which is a popular height for a sky dive and can still be above the clouds .

However, the vehicle can take off and fly at 55mph in the air.The SkyRunner goes from buggy to aircraft in around three minutes and can take off on fields, grass strips and secluded beaches. When in the air, it uses paraglide technology (a large parachute-like wing) to reach a maximum altitude of 15,000ft, although it is restricted to 10,000ft or 3,000 metres, which is a popular height for a sky dive and can still be above the clouds. The cockpit of the SkyRunner (pictured) has a sleek computer interface to control the vehicle instead of 'distracting dials, switches and fiddly buttons,' the company said . The SkyRunner goes from buggy to aircraft in around three minutes and can take off on fields, grass strips and secluded beaches . The car is built from light-weight materials including carbon fibre and weighs 420 kilos. It uses a propeller to get off the ground and power the craft in the air. The EcoBoost engine achieves take-off at just 37mph. Lift is provided by the large relex paraglider wing, which works in the same way as a conventional paragliding chute. Once in the air, the paraglider wing absorbs turbulence to keep the 'car' stable to 'provide a safe and comfortable flight'. In the unlikely event of an engine failure, the SkyRunner floats to the ground using its paraglider, or can also rely on a ballistic reserve chute if there is a problem with the wing. Engineers claim the SkyRunner is capable . of 53 miles-per-gallon on land which gives it a 500 mile range but this . is slashed to 200 nautical miles in the air. The vehicle was designed by a company based in Semley in Dorset called Gilo Industries and can be flown by anyone with a driving license after they complete 12 hours of flight with a certified flight instructor. Stewart Hamel, SkyRunner's founder and CEO, said: 'This vehicle will change the way people experience their world and provide pure enjoyment of flight. 'Imagine driving an all-terrain vehicle that can convert from road to air mode in three minutes - with SkyRunner, that dream has become a reality.' The new machine will make its global debut at this week's Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show in Florida, USA. It is expected to cost around £75,000 with deliveries beginning next year.

But eco-friendly Prince Charles has prompted the design of a purse and planet-friendly kitchen 'for the people', that is specifically designed not to 'cost the earth.' The design of the new, lower-priced British Standard range of cupboards came about after Charles, well known for his environmental campaigns, was impressed with the kitchen in the model home built by Plain English for the The Prince's Foundation for Building Community. A kitchen fit for royalty: Plain English have created eco-friendly kitchen designs . The Prince was first impressed with the kitchen design in a model house at the Ideal Home show in 2011 . Charles was shown around the two-story Prince's House at the Ideal Home show by television property expert Kirstie Allsopp . Prince Charles, who toured the environmentally-friendly model home at the 2011 Ideal Home show, was apparently particularly impressed with the craftsmanship in the kitchen, Remodelista reports. His remarks led Plain English to consider finding a way to bring the 'green' designs to a mass market. The company set about designing a more affordable range of cupboards, which have now gone on sale online. The British Standard cabinets are built in the same workshop in Suffolk as Plain English's higher priced kitchens. But while Plain English is a bespoke company offering a full design and fitting service, customers must collect and install the British Standard cabinets themselves. 'The British Standard Kitchen' by British Standard Cupboards aims to bring high quality long lasting kitchens that are affordable . The British Standard cabinets are built in the same workshop in Suffolk as Plain English's higher priced kitchens, but customers must collect and install the cabinets themselves . Worktops are available in three colours, iroko, oak, or sycamore wood, to give your kitchen an elegant royal makeover, and the range contains floor, tall and wall cabinets, which come in egg shell for you to paint the colour of your choice. An entire kitchen costs about £5,000 while an individual single floor cupboard costs £400. This might not seem particularly cheap, . but the kitchen displayed in the original model home or 'Natural House' showcased at the Ideal Home Show in 2011 would have cost around £35,000 to have installed. Katie Fontana, Creative Director of Plain English and British Standard says: 'We wanted to celebrate 20 years of Plain English by taking a lead from His Royal Highness, Prince Charles: going back to basics and making cupboards that ordinary people can afford - 'sensible cupboards at sensible prices'. 'We are also paying tribute to the British craftsmen of the past whose honest, unfussy but eminently practical designs provided the original inspiration for Plain English all those years ago.' Inside, the house contained cushions made from old T-shirts and re-upholstered chairs made from recycled linen, as well as vintage furniture .

The house is a traditionally built low carbon home made from natural materials. Inside the exhibition hall, Charles was shown around the two-storey Prince's House by television property experts and ambassadors for the charity Kirstie Allsopp and George Clarke. The Prince appeared particularly taken with the crockery featuring dogs, exclaiming 'I love that', and also the red dinner place mats made from old fire hoses . Inside, the house contained cushions made from old T-shirts and re-upholstered chairs made from recycled linen, as well as vintage furniture. After their tour, Ms Allsopp spoke about the Prince's interest in the project. She said: 'He'd seen the blueprint. It was the first time he'd seen it in 3-D as it were, but was very aware of what was going on the whole way through and he'd been to Watford to see the prototype of the house. 'He loved it. What he particularly liked was all the different re-upholstered items and reuse of fabric. He was very impressed by the fact you could take something made for a different purpose and make it domestically useful.' She added: 'It's what the Prince has been so passionate about for so long and yet it is at the moment enormously fashionable.'","Plain English furniture co. created 'sensible cupboards at sensible prices'

Death defying: Co-pilot Sergeant James Ward crawled out along the wing with nothing but a length of rope tied around his waist for security . It was an incredible act of bravery that saw a wartime pilot save his stricken plane and crew by climbing onto the wing to put out a fire at 10,000ft. Co-pilot Sergeant James Ward defied death and a 100mph slipstream by crawling out along the wing with nothing but a length of rope tied around his waist for security. Sgt Ward was awarded the Victoria Cross for his bravery - and now, the Distinguished Flying Cross won by the pilot, Squadron Leader Reuben Widdowson, has sold for £7,500 at auction in London. Sq Ldr Widdowson did a remarkable job keeping the blazing plane steady while Sgt Ward draped a canvas cover over the inferno in the engine. After extinguishing the flames he was pulled back into the Wellington bomber by the rest of the crew who had been preparing to bail out over the North Sea. Sq Ldr Widdowson managed to fly the battered plane back to its base in Suffolk where it was only stopped from careering off the end of the runway by a barbed wire fence. The two pilots had been flying a Wellington bomber and its crew of six on a raid over Munster, Germany, in July 1941 when they were shot at by a Messerschmitt 110 nightfighter. Although rear gunner Sgt Alan Box shot the Luftwaffe plane down, the bomber was critically damaged with its starboard engine out of action and ablaze. Sq Ldr Widdowson instructed the crew to put their parachutes on in readiness to jump and then yelled out ‘...and see if you can put out that bloody fire’. Sgt Ward ripped away the fuselage fabric and tried in vain to douse the flames with a fire extinguisher.

Saved: After extinguishing the flames co-pilot Sergeant James Ward was pulled back into the Wellington bomber (file picture) by the rest of the crew who had been preparing to bail out over the North Sea . Peter Elliott, head of archives at the RAF Museum, said: ‘I don’t think when Widdowson told someone to put the fire out he was seriously suggesting that someone went out on to the wing. ‘Ward picked up the cockpit canvas cover and casually told a member of the crew ""I think I will hop out with this"". Hero: Squadron Leader Reuben Widdowson did a remarkable job keeping the blazing plane steady . ‘His . comrade tried to dissuade him and Ward agreed to have a rope tied . around his waist with the other end tied around the chest of a crew man. ‘Widdowson held the aircraft steady to enable Ward to get onto the wing. The metal wing was covered in fabric and that allowed Ward to grab hold of something as he crawled out. ‘Ward held on with one hand as he managed to smother the fire with the cover. The slipstream began to tug the cover and it then whipped off. ‘But the flames gradually lessened and Ward was pulled back into the aircraft. They had just set out over the North Sea at the time and so this would have all happened at a height of 10,000ft. ‘As captain, Widdowson’s aim was to get the aircraft home but more importantly his crew as well, rather than they bale out and be captured or killed. ‘But to say Ward went the extra mile to ensure this would be something of an understatement. ‘When you think of RAF Victoria Crosses in World War Two, you think of people like Guy Gibson and Leonard Cheshire but James Ward isn’t one of those names that immediately springs to mind.’ Sgt Ward, a New Zealander, was invited to Downing Street to meet Winston Churchill after his heroic action. Sadly, he was killed two months later when his aircraft was struck by flak over Hamburg, caught fire and crashed. Sq Ldr Widdowson’s medals sold at Spinks in Bloomsbury, Central London. Saved: After extinguishing the flames co-pilot Sgt Ward was pulled back into the Wellington bomber (file picture) by the crew . The Wellington, which was affectionately known as the 'Wimpey' by crews, was first proposed by British engineering firm Vickers in 1932. The company produced a twin-engined 'heavy' bomber with the use of geodetic construction. This involved 'weaving' the individual struts of the fuselage to provide a resilient airframe. The first squadron to receive the Wellington was No 99 at RAF Mildenhall, Suffolk, in 1938. Crews saw the aircraft as sturdy, reliable and able to take plenty of damage in combat. The first full day of conflict at the start of the Second World War in 1939 saw 14 Wellingtons in action against the Germans at Brunsbüttel. More than 11,000 Wellingtons were built, with many surviving into the 1950s in second-line duties with the Royal Air Force.","Co-pilot Sgt James Ward crawled along wing rope tied around his waist .

What do you do when you're a multi-millionaire Premier League superstar and you feel like treating yourself? Get another expensive car, of course, and no matter if, judging by Manchester United striker Robin van Persie's bulging keyring, your garage is pretty full already. Earning £180,000 a week (before bonuses), the 30-year-old Dutchman's got to spend it on something, and given the £61,000 price tag of the car in the brochure he's reading, he could easily afford a couple. You want ANOTHER one? Laughing Robbie Savage shares a table with Robin van Persie and his packed keyring . Fleet of cars: Bouchra and Robin van Persie, seen today in Wilmslow, have several luxury motors to choose from . Van Persie, right, and Savage are both car-mad, but Savage's collection is smaller since he retired from football .

Van Persie was spotted in an Alderley Edge coffee shop with football pundit Robbie Savage perusing a luxury car catalogue featuring the Chevrolet Corvette Stingray.  Given that the American car firm sponsors his team, he unlikely to have to pay for it himself. A sport performance car that can reach 62mph in four-and-a-half seconds, it would join a stable of at least half a dozen expensive cars already littering the van Persie driveway. And it would be one of his cheaper runabouts, judging by the fobs on the table which belonged to a Porsche, a Range Rover Sport and an Audi A5, worth at least £155,000. The £12.2 milion-a-year footballer is most often seen out in one of two Porsches: either the sleek, gunmetal grey Porsche Panamera (£63,000), or, when he's with his wife Bouchra and their two children, the larger Porsche Cayenne Techart Magnum 2007 (£125,000). For trips to the supermarket, Mrs Van Persie likes to drive a white BMW X5 with personalised numberplate (around £44,000), or sometimes the dark grey Range Rover Sport (£52,000). When they're out without their children they take the black Audi S5 Sportback Sportline (£40,000), which was recently photographed with a parking ticket after they left it at a station car park without buying a ticket when they nipped into Waitrose.

The heart-warming story of a Pennsylvania woman whose boyfriend suffered a debilitating brain injury has gone viral since the still-loving couple decided to get married despite his continued disability. The Story of Ian & Larissa Murphy is about as atypical as a love story can be, but it begins and ends the way all the best ones do—with young lovebirds beating the odds to finally tie the knot. But after a 10-month courtship came to an abrupt halt when Ian got into a horrific car accident, there was a time when nothing in their young lives seemed certain. Scroll down for video... Weathering the storm: Larissa and Ian Murphy were happily married, but not before the young couple was able to weather incredible hardships . The way they were: Larissa and Ian met in college in 2005 and 10 months later already had plans to get engaged. But their plans came to an abrupt halt when Ian suffered a debilitating brain injury . Shattered: Ian was left unable to communicate and it became doubtful that his and Larissa's dreams would ever come true . ‘Ian and I first met in 2005 at college and had a blast for 10 months getting to know each other,’ Larissa says in a video documenting their story that has been making the internet rounds recently. Larissa says she and Ian were ‘dating very intentionally’ and that they planned to get married soon after they were slated to finish college in December 2006. But before that could happen, tragedy intervened. On September 30 of that year, Ian was on his way to work near Pittsburgh when he was in a serious car crash. Memories: Larissa says Ian was shopping for engagement rings when he suffered his injury near Pittsburgh just months before they were to graduate from college in 2006 . Hopeful: Larissa moved into Ian's family's home to help take care of him and waited for him to improve. If he could communicate, she said, then they could make a marriage work . ‘We got a phone call that he had been in an accident,’ Larissa says. ‘ [He] had suffered a traumatic brain injury.’ Suddenly, what had seemed so certain to Larissa, became frighteningly out of reach. 'We watched our future crash with him in that white station wagon,' she writes on desiringgod.org. But instead of moving on to another man and future husband, Larissa moved into Ian family’s home to help take care of him. Though Ian was unable to communicate, she continued to date him. ‘I knew where he was so after he couldn’t talk, that helped me so much. I knew that he loved me,’ she says. ‘Looking back, it’s weird because he couldn’t talk and he couldn’t eat, so we probably looked like complete weirdos when we went on dates. But we had a blast and I just talked to him all the time.’ True love: 'I still don't think that Ian would have ever left me if the role had been reversed. And walking away from my best friend was never truly an option,' says Larissa . Larissa says she and Ian were dating 'very intentionally' by 2006 and - despite Ian's subsequent debilitating injuries that keep him from communicating even remotely normally - they were married . Finally: Once Ian could communicate, the couple had to ask a judge if they could marry. He said the marriage could proceed . 'You two exemplify what love is all about. I believe that marriage will not only benefit you both but our community and hope that everyone in this city could see your love for one another,' said the judge who determined if they could marry . 'And even though we chose marriage, we chose it sadly': Larissa and Ian live in western Pennsylvania. Larissa looks to God for inspiration as she continue to struggle with the loss of the man she once knew . As Ian’s condition slowly improved, the possibility of marriage became stronger. ‘If he could communicate with me,’ she said. ‘Then we could have a marriage knowing it would be really different but as long as Ian could talk to me we could make it work.’ While Ian became incrementally healthier, his father became sick. He was diagnosed with brain cancer during his son’s recovery. Ian’s father’s sickness became a catalyst for Larissa, who knew how much he wanted them to marry. When Ian was well enough, Larissa took him to a judge in order to get their marriage approved since he remains unable to make that sort of decision on his own. According to Larissa, the judge told her: ‘You two exemplify what love is all about. I believe that marriage will not only benefit you both but our community and hope that everyone in this city could see your love for one another.’ Bittersweet: 'We've watched all of our friends get married and have health. I've watched as my girlfriends and sisters found husbands who could dance with them at their weddings and drive them to church on Sunday morning,' says Larissa . Bittersweet: 'Sorrow has been a permanent resident in our 20s. It feels like the rest of the world uses these years for really fun things. But in our 20s, we have watched our future crash with him in that white station wagon' 'It was so very simple: we love each other': While Larissa never expected to have to provide so much for her husband's needs, she says the choice to marry was an easy one . Touching: Larissa keeps a board in their home on which she and Ian and their visitors post what their thankful for. Larissa says half of Ian's say 'my wifey' They would soon be married, though the new would come too late to share with Ian’s father, who died before their engagement. Their video documents their touching, family and friend-filled wedding. Instead of standing, Larissa sits at the altar to be alongside the still seriously disabled Ian. She must even help him stand as they complete their vows, just as she must now help him with everyday tasks. Dedicated: Larissa spends her days working in marketing at a western Pennsylvania bank to help support Ian, who is unable to work . Faithful: 'This church, and this marriage, are hemmed in by Jesus and eagerly long for heaven. He is their author and sustainer,' says Larissa . 'But in light of all the practicals, and emotionals,' says Larissa, 'it was so very simple: we love each other. And we love God. And we believe He is a sovereign and loving God who rules all things.' Difficult: 'Marrying Ian meant that I was signing on to things that I don¿t think I ever would've chosen for myself,' says Larissa, who supports Ian and manages his care. 'The practical costs felt huge' 'Though we chose marriage,' says Larissa, 'we chose it sadly. Sorrow has been a permanent resident in our 20s. It feels like the rest of the world uses these years for really fun things. But in our 20s, we have watched our future crash with him in that white station wagon and we now live with two versions of Ian. 'Weʼve watched all of our friends get married and have health. Iʼve watched as my girlfriends and sisters found husbands who could dance with them at their weddings and drive them to church on Sunday morning. 'Weʼve watched our dad fight and be taken by brain cancer, only to see life keep marching on.' Despite it all, Larissa says it is worth it to be married to the love of her life. ‘But in light of all the practicals, and emotionals,’ she writes on desiringgod.org, ‘it was so very simple: we love each other.’ Larissa admits she's been close to losing her happiness as she struggles with 'our lot' - a struggle she says is a common one - but she manages to keep the faith thanks to her religion . Still smiling: Alongside Ian, Larissa is still able top enjoy herself at celebrations like weddings and births despite her own personal losses . Here, Larissa gleefully holds a baby despite her longing to have one of her own, which may never happen because of her choice to stay with Ian . Inseparable: Despite his need for 24-hour care and inability to communicate as he once could, Ian still manages to have fun with Larissa . Contentment through suffering: 'I didn't know contentment in my prosperity,' writes Larissa. She says the trials and tribulations she suffered with Ian have strengthened her faith and spirit .","Larissa Murphy feared she'd never marry Ian after he suffered a horrific brain injury while driving to work near Pittsburgh .

Alaska is home to all three species of American bear - the brown, black and polar bears.

A drama teacher has said sorry and admitted she was 'stupid' after being banned indefinitely from the classroom for asking a 17-year-old boy for sex and playing a game with pupils called Who’s A Virgin?. Lindsay Black also urged . her sixth-formers to mime sexual acts at the Roman Catholic school where she . taught, but has maintained that her students got good results. 'I'm extremely embarrassed and know it . was inappropriate. I sincerely regret my actions. I am aware of the . hurt and distress caused by my behaviour,' she said in a statement, . according to The Sun. But the 28-year-old added: 'My class all did well in their exams and some of them achieved better than their predicted grades.' Drama teacher: Lindsay Black, 28, has apologised after being banned from teaching after having told a schoolboy she had fantasised about performing a sex act on him and pestered him for sex, a hearing heard . Black was interviewed by police following the allegations in 2011 but no further action was taken. She was still struck off having paid particular attention to a teenager who was performing in the school musical, and revealed to pupils that she fantasised about having sex in the drama class and cheating on her fiancé.Black sent text messages, emails and Facebook messages to the 17-year-old boy, asking him to meet up for sex. Sex teacher: Miss Black also got the class to play a game of 'I have never' and questioned them about sex . 'I realise I was . stupid and naive to get involved in a Facebook conversation with a . pupil,' Black said. It was said the schoolboy, referred to as Pupil A, showed other pupils text messages from Black as he rehearsed for We Will Rock You, a show based on the songs of rock band Queen. English teacher Abigail Watts said: ‘I heard comments from other pupils about Miss Black liking pupils and I asked what this meant. They said she had been Facebook messaging Pupil A – she told him she had a dream about them having sex.’ She added: ‘They had not met up but they had been talking about it.’ The hearing was told Black ‘flirted’ with the boy during lessons and sent him a message saying how she dreamt about him. The trained actress met the teenager while working on maternity cover at St Joseph’s Roman Catholic High School in Newport, South Wales. She contacted him on Facebook asking about his coursework – then began sending him messages talking about sex and alcohol. Black told the boy she had a dream in which she performed a sex act on him, then asked him to meet up with her for sex. A Professional Conduct Committee of the General Teaching Council of Wales heard she even grilled the boy’s girlfriend about their relationship. The hearing was told that Black played a game in which she asked her sixth form class, ‘Who’s a virgin?’ and made pupils stand up if they had not yet had sex. She also played a game named I Have Never in which she would ask them if they had performed various sex acts. The hearing was told Black then encouraged the teenagers to mime sex acts and spent time talking to pupils about sex. When Black was confronted by the head of drama she told him it was just an exercise to get pupils ‘into character’. Drama: The teacher, who was doing maternity cover at St Joseph's Catholic High School in Newport, has been struck off . Colleague Sandra Davies said: ‘Pupils told me that during drama classes Miss Black would talk about sex and she turned the lessons on to a sexual theme. She said she wanted to cheat on her fiancé once before getting married and that she fantasised about having sex on a table in the drama class. ‘They played a game called I Have Never where she would ask them things [about sex]. She would then get the pupils to act out the acts in question.’ The hearing in Cardiff was told how Pupil A’s academic performance had suffered as a result of the messages and he had to re-sit his AS levels.

Black’s actions are . fundamentally incompatible with being a registered teacher' - Committee Chairman Peter Williams . She later admitted engaging in inappropriate and sexually explicit conversations with a pupil via Facebook.

They found her actions amount to unacceptable professional conduct and banned her from teaching.Committee chairman Peter Williams said: ‘The conduct in question seriously affected pupils and was not an isolated lapse. Black’s actions are fundamentally incompatible with being a registered teacher.’Black declined to comment at her house in Pontypridd after the hearing.

Missing teenager Esme Smith has been found safe and well after a member of the public recognised her from media reports about her disappearance. The 14-year-old from Farnham, Surrey was spotted in North London by a passer-by who flagged down a nearby patrol car and alerted officers, according to Surrey Police. Esme was last seen 11 days ago when she left school with friends, telling them that she was travelling to nearby Woking and would then go on to a party. Scroll down for video . Found: Esme Smith, 14, has been discovered in London after going missing from her home in Surrey . Instead she went to Aldershot railway station and caught a train to London's Waterloo station, where she was caught on CCTV. Her worried family issued an appeal for information, saying they feared she might be in danger. The daughter of a Nato commander was yesterday found in North London and has now been returned to Surrey, according to a Surrey Police spokesman. It is unclear whether or not she was with anyone else when she was seen by a passer-by, although she was alone when she was escorted to a North London police station yesterday. Officials in Surrey were due today to interview her about her whereabouts for the past 11 days and determine whether or not she has been the victim of a crime. CCTV: Surveillance footage showed the 14-year-old getting off a train at Waterloo on September 12 . On camera: The teenager had changed out of her school uniform by the time she arrived in London, pictured . CCTV images of the teenager at Waterloo show she had changed out of her school uniform and into a white flowery dress. She was also wearing a blue denim jacket and was carrying a black school bag and black floral bag with chain straps. The police spokesman said: 'A call was made to Surrey Police by the Metropolitan Police around 9.40am today to say that the 14-year-old, who went missing on September 12, was at a north London police station. 'Her safe return is thought to be as a direct result of the media appeals, and the media and public are thanked for their assistance.' There was no answer at the Smiths' family home today, but a neighbour revealed that locals were delighted by the news that Esme had been found. 'It's wonderful news that she has turned up,' the man said. 'I have to admit we were all worried, so this is a massive relief to finally have some good news.' A tall, black man driving a BMW, who was believed to be a social worker, turned up at the family home yesterday afternoon and left half an hour later carrying a small suitcase. Her 19-year-old sister Sian last week . made an emotional appeal to the missing girl, saying: ‘Esme, if you are . reading this, I just want to say please come home or at least get in . touch so that we know that you are safe. ‘We . are all really worried about you and we just want to make sure you are . OK. You are not in any trouble so please just get in touch.’ More than 4,000 people had 'liked' a Facebook page called Find Esme Smith, dedicated to raising awareness of the girl's disappearance. Her . father Mark Smith, who works at Nato’s Joint Warfare Centre in . Stavanger, said he was 'worried sick' about his teenage . daughter. Mr Smith has been decorated for service in Afghanistan, the Gulf War and Northern Ireland and he has been commander of medical planning at the Norwegian base since March last year. Esme . is a pupil at All Hallows Catholic School in Farnham, where she was . last seen by friends at the end of the school day on September 12. Detective Superintendent Jon Savell thanked the public and the media for their assistance in helping to find Esme. The head of public protection for Surrey Police said: 'Throughout our search for Esme, we were very fortunate to have the support of the local community, Esme's school, her friends, the public and the media, and it was as a direct result of the media activity that she was found. 'We have seen huge use of social media, such as Twitter and Facebook, throughout our search and this has been really beneficial but we would now ask that these pages are taken down. This has been a very distressing time for Esme and her family and we would ask that that their privacy is respected.' Mr Savell said that establishing what happened to Esme was a priority. He said: 'It is unclear what has happened and where she has been, and establishing that is obviously a priority for us, as is ensuring her health and welfare, and continuing to support her family.'

"By . Chris Parsons . UPDATED: . 08:17 EST, 17 November 2011 . He's known as something of an emotional man after shedding a tear when he became Speaker of the House last year. But it seems John Boehner is making a habit of showing his sensitive side after once again weeping at an event to honour astronauts Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins and Buzz Aldrin. The House Speaker had given a speech praising the work of the Moon landing astronauts and became tearful after stepping from the podium at Washington's Capitol Hill. Cry me to the moon: Normally the recipients of medals are the ones who let the occasion get the better of them, but in Washington Mr Boehner gave out the awards before bursting into tears . Astronaut Neil Armstrong gives Mr Boehner a quizical look after the Speaker lets his feelings get the better of him at the Congressional Medal ceremony . Sensitive: A teary Mr Boehner stands between Armstrong, left, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, 2nd from right, and astronaut John Glenn, right . The three astronauts were awarded a Congressional Gold Medal, which was approved in July 2009 to mark the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing. Boehner told the assembled crowd at the medal ceremony: 'Neil Armstrong was once asked: Why did you, this one man, choose to speak for all when you set foot on the lunar surface? As it turns out, there was no script, there were no notes. 'When the moment came, Neil's thoughts turned to the 400,000 people who worked on the project.... He said he knew 'it would be a big something for all those folks and a lot of others who weren't even involved in the project.' So it was.' It was after this speech and having given out the medals that Boehner started crying, to the surprise of onlookers. One attendee at the ceremony told the Huffington Post: 'It was certainly a moving event, but seeing him sob and gasp for air was sort of off-putting.' Emotional: The outburst of feelings is not the first time Me Boehner broke down at a public event as, pictured here, he was tearful when he became Speaker of the House in November 2010. Mr Boehner's spokesperson Brendan Buck said the speaker only cried because he was so moved at the chance to share and stage with and honour the Moon landing heroes. Mr Buck said: 'Like the speaker said, honoring these American heroes was a pretty cool opportunity. After winning control of the House last November, Mr Boehner was seen to break down, having told how he had 'lived the American dream.' And earlier the same year he was left in tears after accepting the gavel from former Speaker Nancy Pelosi in January 2010. Speaking to Fox News, Mr Boehner last year defended his habit of showing his emotions in public. He said: 'I'm not going to apologize for being emotionally attached to the things I feel most strongly about. 'I wear my emotions on my sleeve.'","Speaker wept during Moon landing medal ceremony .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 23:46 EST, 11 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:33 EST, 12 November 2013 . Britain's greedy energy firms were today accused by the government of treating their customers like 'cash cows' which can be 'squeezed' to increase profits. Energy Secretary Ed Davey used a speech today to point the finger at power bosses for behaving as badly as disgraced banker Fred ‘the Shred’ Goodwin, who presided over the collapse of RBS. As the industry accused the minister of 'tit for tat insults', EDF announced rises 3.9 per cent amid reports E.ON will push up prices by 6.6 per cent, much lower than the hikes of up to 10 per cent imposed by the rest of the Big Six. How bills will soar . Mr Davey used a speech to the energy industry's annual conference to launch the most outspoken attack so . far on bosses from the so-called Big Six of EDF, nPower, British Gas, . Scottish Power, SSE and E.ON. He accused them of greed for ramping . up prices for consumers while wholesale prices are barely increasing. E.ON is expected to raise its charges by 6.6 per cent this month, becoming the fifth of the top six energy firms to increase fees by more than twice the rate of inflation, according to the Telegraph. About four million homes will be hit by the rise, with customers on non-fixed tariffs paying an extra £90 per year. Meanwhile, EDF announced its bills will go up by just 3.9 per cent, much lower than the crippling rises announced by the rest of the Big Six. But it appeared to threaten the government that if it fails to cut green levies it will have to 'review' its prices, paving the way for another increase. Squeeze: Energy Secretary Ed Davey warned power firms not to hike bills just to maximise profits . ScottishPower bills are going up by 9 per cent, Npower announced a 10.4 per cent price hike, British Gas a 9.2 per cent rise and Scottish & Southern Energy an 8.2 per cent increase. Energy regulator Ofgem says the amount of profit raised from bills has doubled in a year, while the wholesale costs of gas and electricity have remained almost unchanged. Tom Lyon, energy expert at uSwitch.com, said: . 'Any winter price rise is a blow to consumers as it makes the struggle to afford to stay warm that little bit harder. 'However, EDF Energy is to be applauded for the stance it is taking by factoring in the potential reduction on green levies into its calculations. 'This means that customers will know upfront that they will benefit from any step the Government takes to reduce the impact of 'hidden' taxes on bills. 'More importantly it also challenges the Government to put its money where its mouth is and to make good its pledges on affordability.' In his speech Mr Davey conceded that power firms have to make profits to invest in infrastructure. But he told industry umbrella group Energy UK, he will warn: 'Those profits cannot come at the expense of the elderly, the vulnerable and the poorest in our society. 'Customers are not just cash cows to be squeezed in the pursuit of a higher return for shareholders. 'And frankly the latest round of bill rises have not been fully and openly justified. 'When people see energy bills rising way above inflation, year on year, you can understand the anger and frustration this causes. 'People fear shareholder interests are being put in front of the needs of families and the fuel poor.' Money to burn... E.ON will raise its charges by 6.6 per cent this month, becoming the fifth of the top six energy firms to increase prices . The announcement by French-owned power firm EDF that its prices will rise by just 3.9 per cent sparked immediate questions about why other firms' increase are more than twice as high. The Big Six have argued that rising wholesale costs and green levies mean they have no choice but to increase bills. ScottishPower bills are going up by 9 . per cent, Npower announced a 10.4 per cent price hike, British Gas a 9.2 . per cent rise and Scottish & Southern Energy an 8.2 per cent . increase. But EDF chief executive Vincent de Rivaz said: 'The best way to help customers is for us to keep our prices as low as possible. 'I know that price rises are always unwelcome, but we have taken the first step to show what can be done if rising costs are tackled head-on.' The lower rise was welcomed by campaign groups. Richard Lloyd, executive director of Which?, said: 'While any increase is bad news for hard-pressed consumers, today's announcement will make people question why other major suppliers have hit their customers so much harder. 'People want to hear more than just tough talk from the politicians - they want to see tough new action to fix our broken energy market, not tinkering at the edges while consumers grapple with the rising cost of living.' Mr Davey said the Government is looking at how it could reduce the impact of its policies on bills. 'But . our commitment must be matched by a commitment in industry to open up . your books and set out exactly how you are bearing down on your own . costs to make bills as low as possible. 'The . industry must be much more transparent and Ofgem will have our full . support to introduce whatever regulations are necessary to deliver that . greater transparency.' David Cameron and Nick Clegg are holding talks this week on how to remove green levies from energy bills which add more than £100 to costs for every customer. It is thought the Energy Companies Obligation, which raises money to pay for insulation and other efficiency measures, will be funded from general taxation instead. Ministers are desperate to find a way to . save at least £60-a-year from bills, in order to boast that they have . cut costs by more than the £120 over 20 months which Labour leader Ed . Miliband claims his bills freeze would save. Energy UK said 95 per cent of rising costs were out of the hands of the industry. And it hit back at Mr Davey's outspoken criticism of their business practices. A spokesman said: 'The energy industry is already working hard to ensure everyone can keep the lights on and stay warm this winter. 'The best way to do this is for everyone to work together which is why this tit for tat Punch and Judy show of insults is so unproductive. 'The energy industry is vital to the UK. It is  a major employer, a serious investor and a significant taxpayer.' Speaking at today's conference, Energy UK's chief executive Angela Knight said the industry had a problem of trust as a result of increases in bills. 'We have got a problem - an image problem, a reputational problem, a trust problem,' she said. 'Trust is hard to gain and it's easy to lose. 'Energy bills have risen for well-known reasons, reasons that the industry has made quite clear.' Ms Knight defended the profits made by energy firms, saying: 'Profitability is a good thing, it's not a bad thing. 'That profitability maintains the industry and, when it pays dividends, it pays for pensions as well.' Caroline Flint, Labour's shadow energy secretary, said: 'David Cameron's out of touch Government is offering nothing to the millions of families faced with rising energy bills and a cost-of-living crisis. 'Ed Davey and the Lib Dems had a chance to support Labour's energy bill freeze but have chosen instead to side with the Tories and the energy companies. It just goes to show you can't trust a word they say.'","EDF pushes up prices by 3.9%, much lower than the rest of the Big Six .

But it will now appear on Waitrose shelves this weekend in the form of a Waitrose Cooks' Ingredients juice, selling for £4.59 for a 60ml bottle.

Ruling: Mr Justice Keehan today dissolved the sham marriage at the High Court after he decided that the victim lacked the mental capacity to make the decision to marry . A Pakistani man groomed a teenager with learning difficulties before marrying her in a desperate attempt to stay in Britain, the High Court heard today. The immigrant wanted to wed his vulnerable victim believing he would avoid being deported because it would breach his human rights. Judge Mr Justice Keehan said today exploiting 'young and vulnerable' adults by targeting them for sham marriages will not be tolerated by the courts, as he struck out their marriage as unlawful. Sitting in the Court of Protection, the judge said the man, who is in his twenties, exploited and took advantage of her 'for the purpose of seeking to bolster his immigration appeal and his prospects of being permitted to remain in this country'. He was deported in 2012. Declaring the ceremony a 'non-marriage', the judge emphasised: 'It is vital that the message is clearly sent out to those who seek to exploit young and vulnerable adults that the courts will not tolerate such exploitation.' None of the parties can be named because of a court order. The young woman at the centre of the case, who is now aged 19, is referred to as SY in the ruling, and the man as TK. Mr Justice Keehan said it was 'plain on the facts of this case' that TK 'exploited and took advantage of SY for the purpose of seeking to bolster his immigration appeal and his prospects of being permitted to remain in this country', adding that the June 2012 ceremony he and SY engaged in at TK's home 'formed the bedrock of that objective'. He said: 'TK well knew that SY had learning difficulties and was a vulnerable young woman. He knew that the police and the care services were extremely concerned about his involvement with SY. 'I can reach no other conclusion than he deliberately targeted SY because of her learning difficulties and her vulnerability. The courts will not tolerate such gross exploitation.' The judge added: 'Fortunately, it would appear that TK's involvement in SY's life is not now causing her emotional distress or harm. 'It was, however, yet another abusive and exploitative episode in her life which could have had serious physical, emotional and psychological consequences for her.' He said: 'In my judgment it is important for SY that a declaration of non-marriage is made in respect of the June 2012 ceremony. 'There are also, in my judgment, compelling reasons of public policy why sham 'marriages' are declared non-marriages. It is vital that the message is clearly sent out to those who seek to exploit young and vulnerable adults that the courts will not tolerate such exploitation.' Cynical: The High Court heard that the Pakistani male - known as TK - had hoped the sham marriage would help his human rights case - but he was still deported in 2012 . The judge's message came as part of a ruling involving an application made by a local authority in the Court of Protection in respect of the capacity of the young woman to litigate and to make decisions relating to her life. In his conclusions, Mr Justice Keehan states: 'It is plain from all of the evidence before me that SY lacks the capacity to litigate and the capacity to make decisions about her residence, her contact with others, her care package and to enter a contract of marriage.' He ruled that she does have the capacity to consent to sexual relations. TK, who was born in Pakistan, came to the UK in 2009 as a student. His application to continue his studies was refused and his appeal was dismissed on the basis of a tribunal finding that he had submitted two forged documents and had attempted to deceive the immigration authorities. His rights of appeal were exhausted in June 2011. The judge said: 'It is in this context that he began a relationship with SY in August 2011.' On or around June 15 2012 he was arrested for immigration offences and detained by the UK Border Agency pending his deportation. He claimed asylum on the basis that he feared he would be killed by his family who disapproved of his marriage to a white British woman. In July 2012 his appeal against the refusal to grant him asylum was dismissed on all grounds - his relationship with SY 'lay at the heart of the case he sought to mount' - and he was deported the following month. The judge said: 'Happily it appears that after particularly difficult and turbulent experiences over, at least, the last eight years, SY is now settled and contented in her current placement. She is enjoying her college course which she embarked on a few months ago.' He added: 'It is pleasing to note that SY has been successfully assisted with an appropriate placement, care package and support to be leading a stable and happy life with positive experiences for her.'","Man in his 20s set up sham marriage with girl to avoid being deported .

The bill for winter fuel payments to British pensioners  living abroad has soared by 70 per cent in a year, thanks to a European court ruling. As millions of elderly people in the UK face a cold winter and inflation-busting rises to their energy bills, it was revealed that a record £21million was paid last year to expats living in sunnier climes such as Spain, Cyprus and France. It came as new figures from energy watchdog Ofgem showed that record numbers of Scots were in arrears on their fuel bills. The number of winter fuel payments made overseas has rocketed in the last decade, with sharp rises in Spain, France and Ireland in the last year . Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith yesterday said the decision by the European Court of Justice was ‘ridiculous’ as his department revealed its staggering cost. The bill soared from £12.8million in 2011/12 after judges ruled that anyone with a ‘sufficient link’ to Britain could claim the £200-£300 allowance. ‘The huge increase in UK  winter fuel payments equates to a near doubling in costs to the British taxpayer and that is wholly unacceptable,’ he said. ‘It is not fair and it’s not something this government is going to tolerate. ‘This increase is a direct result of a ridiculous ruling by the European Court of Justice and we are not prepared to sit back and allow hard-working taxpayers money to be used in this way.’ Previously, expats had to be resident in Britain until they were 60 before they could claim the benefit, but the ruling allows people who lived or worked in Britain for most of their lives to qualify. Anger: Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said it was 'ridiculous' that British money was being sent overseas . Last year, 49,443 pensioners living in Spain alone – where temperatures in December and January can reach 63F (17C) – received £8.8million. Last year, the allowance was claimed by nearly 120,000  people living in the European Economic Area. It is estimated that the European judges’ ruling allowed up to 440,000 expats to claim the payment. However, from 2015 pensioners living in countries with an average winter temperature higher than the warmest part of the UK will be unable to claim, excluding around 100,000 expats. There has been deepening controversy over the growing bill in so-called ‘sunshine  benefits’ to expats, which are costing the taxpayer around £2million a week. Around 12million pensioners in Britain receive the winter fuel payment, but critics – including Mr Duncan Smith and Nick Clegg – have called for it to be limited to poorer people who need help to meet their fuel bills. However, David Cameron has promised to protect the payments – which are worth £200 to a household with someone aged over 60, and £300 for those aged over 80 – until 2015. The news came as figures from Ofgem showed that Scots are more likely to be in arrears on their power bills than families in other parts of the UK. Some 6.1 per cent of gas users and 5.9 per cent of electricity users are in debt to energy firms, compared with a UK average of 5 per cent. Heating: Expats living on the Costa del Sol are among 50,000 people in Spain to share £8.9million in UK taxpayer help with their winter fuel bills . At the end of 2012, a total of 153,201 Scottish households owed money on their electricity bills and 119,125 on their gas accounts. With the average bill set to hit a record £1,500, many will face a growing battle to keep the heating on. The number of households repaying arrears on gas bills has soared by 11 per cent in two years. A spokesman for trade body Energy UK, said: ‘Energy  suppliers take seriously their responsibilities for helping  vulnerable customers, and  customers in debt, targeting appropriate support to meet individual circumstances. It follows recent announcements by the Big Six energy firms of rises to bills of up to 10 per cent. EDF Energy was the latest to announce its increases yesterday, saying that both gas and electricity prices would rise by 3.9 per cent in January.","Taxpayer spends £21million on payments in 2012-13, up from £12.8million .

Now, 18 years later, America's most widely-reported case of two children who were switched at birth continues to remain relevant - and one of the girls has given a rare interview about how it has affected her as an adult.

Her biological parents were Kevin Chittum and Whitney Rogers, and the daughter they took home and raised, Rebecca, was actually Paula's birth child. Scroll down for video .

The biological parents: Kevin Rogers (left) and Whitney Chittum (right) were 18 and 16 respectively when they had their first child in 1995.

But in a tragic twist of fate, Kevin and Whitney, along with four other relatives, died in a shocking car crash the same day the University of Virginia Medical Center in Charlottesville discovered they had switched the children shortly after their birth in June 1995. It meant the couple died without knowing the mistake that had been made and that Rebecca would grow up without her 'parents'. Today Callie is 18, living on her own in Richmond, Virginia and is planning on going to culinary school, but 'adoptive' mom Paula who raised her remains the single biggest person in her life. 'The big question everyone always asks me is 'Would you prefer your parents still be alive or passed?' she said in an interview this week with CBS 6. Devastating: In a horrible coincidence, Kevin Chittum and Whitney Rogers died in a shocking car crash the day it was discovered their child had been switched at birth and they never found out the truth. The car they were traveling in collided with a truck during wet weather on Interstate 81 near Roanoke in North Carolina . Write caption here . Pressure: The University of Virginia Medical Center in Charlottesville came under intense scrutiny after it was made public at a press conference in 1998 they had accidentally switched two babies in the maternity ward three years earlier . 'I don’t know what I’m missing so in a sense, I do feel more sorry for Rebecca, because she doesn’t know her biological mom.' National headlines: The story was major news, even partially eclipsing the Monica Lewinsky affair, which happened around the same time . Paula said she 'does not have a relationship' with Rebecca following years of trying to get custody of her as a child. Conversely, Paula is more than just a mom to Callie. 'She's my best friend,' Callie said. 'She always has been. 'And I can honestly say that.' Paula said she and her daughter have been incredibly open about the truth and how she isn't Callie's biological mother. 'I've always taught her from day one they are her parents,' Paula said. 'She was born in Whitney's belly and she was born in my heart'. It is Paula's journey through the ordeal that was arguably the most turbulent. She found out the truth first after her boyfriend asked for a paternity test to see if he were Callie's father. The test was negative for both him and her. Neither of the them were Callie's biological parent. She then reported it to the Virginia hospital, who pieced together what had happened. Struggle: After finding out the truth, Paula Johnson (left) began a long and arduous custody battle to claim her biological daughter, Rebecca Chittum, following the death of Rebecca's parents .

Only one baby girl born in the same short window as Callie that July had the right blood type. The Chittum and Rogers family found out the truth two weeks after Kevin and Whitney's funeral following a blood test of Rebecca. Paula even remembered bumping into Whitney in the hall when both were in labor. After learning that Kevin and Whitney died, Paula tried to claim her biological child and sued for custody of Rebecca in 1999. However Kevin and Whitney's parents, the grandparents as Rebecca knew them, fought just as hard to keep her. Following a bitter three-year battle both in and out of court, a judge ruled the girls would stay with the families who had raised until they were old enough to make their own decisions. A visitation schedule was put into play, but both girls quickly grew tired of the long trips to see biological family members they hardly knew. Paula also sued the University of Virginia Center for their mistake, hoping for a damages payout of $31 million. Happy family: Paula Johnson and daughter Callie share a giggle inside Callie's home in Richmond, Virginia . Not-so-happy: Paula Johnson says she has never been able to let go of the hate she feels from her ordeal and the fact she has no relationship with her biological daughter . However she settled for just $1.25 million. Paula said her anger at the situation has never really subsided. 'I’m angry because I don’t have a relationship with my biological child,' she said this week. 'I’m angry that Kevin and Whitney aren’t here to see what a beautiful child she is and how much she’s grown. 'I’m angry at the hospital because the only thing I ever asked was them to apologize.' Callie is planning to write a tell-all about the 'Switched at Birth' saga.

Four in 10 people are so disconnected from politics they might not vote, new research shows. The alienated voters do not trust people in public life and are left unimpressed by all political parties. The Commons anti-sleaze watchdog warns that the under-30s are particularly disenchanted, raising fears for the voter turnout in the future. The Committee on Standards in Public Life . sounded the alarm on voter apathy after comedian Russell Brand and . Newsnight’s Jeremy Paxman said they had chosen to vote because they were . so unimpressed by the choices on offer. Apathy: Jeremy Paxman and Russell Brand have admitted in recent weeks not voting after being left unimpressed by today's crop of politicians . A poll by the committee found a ‘considerable proportion’ of the British population, around 40 per cent of those surveyed, were ‘disconnected’ or ‘alienated’ from the domain of party politics. ‘For them, the system offers no party sufficiently attractive to win their vote,’ the committee said. ‘These citizens in particular hold sceptical or deeply sceptical perceptions of standards and do not trust those in public life.’ They are not just disconnected by the incumbent government, but are also turned off by the opposition and even the newer, smaller political parties like the Greens, UKIP and the BNP. Voters are also now more likely to say MPs will take bribes, lie and are out of touch. The TNS-BRMB survey for the Committee on Standards in Public Life revealed public attitudes towards MPs . The committee warned: ‘This alienated group of citizens just sees no party that could sufficiently express their political views or represent their interests, and is overwhelmingly sceptical or deeply sceptical about public life. ‘Moreover, they are particularly located in the younger age groups, with 46 per cent of the under 30s falling into this category.’ Lord Bew, who chairs the committee, told The Independent: ‘One particular cause for concern from the research is the number of people, especially young people, who feel disconnected from the political system and political parties.’ The row over high profile stars refusing to vote erupted after Russell Brand said he had never voted because he regarded politicians as untrustworthy and irrelevant. He told the BBC: 'I'm angry, because for me its real. this is what I come from... there is going to be a revolution. 'Don't bother voting. Stop voting stop pretending, wake up, be in reality now. Why vote? We know it's not going to make any difference.' Voters are now more likely to say MPs will take bribes, lie and are out of touch . Mr Paxman took him to task in a high profile interview but later admitted he finds the current parties so uninspiring he also has not bothered to vote. The Newsnight host  revealed he failed to cast a ballot in a recent election because he was unable to choose between rival candidates. Writing in the Radio Times, Mr Paxman said: ‘In one recent election, I decided not to vote, because I thought the choice so unappetising. ‘By the time the polls had closed and it was too late to take part, I was feeling really uncomfortable: the person who chooses not to vote – cannot even be bothered to write “none of the above” on a ballot paper - disqualifies himself from passing any comment at all.’ But Mr Paxman was heavily criticised by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg for setting a bad example. Mr Clegg said: ‘He’s a guy who gets paid £1million or thereabouts, paid for by taxpayers, he lives off politics and he spends all his time sneering at politics.’","Under-30s are particularly disenchanted, warns the anti-sleaze watchdog .

"By . Leon Watson . PUBLISHED: . 07:39 EST, 6 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:02 EST, 7 November 2013 . Billionaire F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone has defended himself in court today against allegations . he made a 'corrupt bargain' to stay at the top of the sport. The 82-year-old appeared at the High Court in London accused of . entering into a 'corrupt agreement' with a banker to facilitate the sale . of the Formula 1 group to a buyer 'chosen' by him. Legal action has been taken against him by a German media company which says it lost . out as a result of the deal. On the defence: Bernie Ecclestone arriving to defend himself against allegations that he made a 'corrupt bargain' in a bid to stay at the top of Formula 1 . But the chief executive of the Formula 1 group says Constantin . Medien's claim 'lacks any merit' and denies any 'conspiracy'. A trial in . London is expected to last several weeks. Mr Ecclestone told a judge that he . made payments to the banker because the banker insinuated that he would . create difficulties with tax authorities. 'It is true,' said Mr Ecclestone. 'That's what I have always said.' Mr Ecclestone told the court: 'I made . the payment ... because he said he would shake me down concerning tax . arrangements with our family trust ... which would have been very . expensive.' He added: 'It was £10 million as it happens.' Mr Ecclestone denied saying different things to journalists or changing his story. Making his case: Mr Ecclestone has been accused of . entering into a 'corrupt agreement' with a banker . He said: 'Most of these journalists, as you know, really should be closely working with Jeffrey Archer.' Philip Marshall QC, for Constantin, had outlined allegations at the start of the trial. He said the banker 'assisted' Mr . Ecclestone to facilitate the sale of the Formula 1 Group to a 'purchaser . chosen by Mr Ecclestone'. Mr Marshall suggested that 'corrupt . payments' resulted in a sale of the bank's investment in a group of . companies which owned 'lucrative commercial rights' associated with . Formula 1. He said payments totalling about £27 . million were made to Gerhard Gribkowsky - who had been a 'senior ranking . official' at a German bank - at the instigation of Mr Ecclestone. Mr Marshall said a 'corrupt arrangement' was entered into between Mr Ecclestone and Dr Gribkowsky in 2005. On trial: Bernie Ecclestone, pictured here with former world champion F1 driver Michael Schumacher in 2000 . He said Mr Ecclestone benefited . financially and the deal allowed Mr Ecclestone to retain a 'position . with Formula 1 going forward'. There had been a 'real risk' of Mr Ecclestone's removal from his position in the Formula 1 Group, he added. Mr Marshall said the German bank sold its 'holding' in the Formula 1 Group to a private equity group called CVC. Bernie Ecclestone is president and CEO of Formula One Management and Formula One Administration. Pictured here is the 2013 British Grand Prix at Silverstone . He said Mr Ecclestone thought CVC . would support his 'continuing role as chief executive' of operating . companies in the Formula 1 Group. Mr Marshall said Constantin had investment rights in the Formula 1 Group and was entitled to proceeds of any sale. He said the bank's investment was sold 'without the normal and proper process' and Constantin lost out. Mr Marshall said the judge would have . to make decisions on a number of issues and added: 'The central issues . are, firstly, over whether these payments were corrupt and, secondly, . over whether they resulted in a sale of the investment of (the German . bank) in a group of companies owning the lucrative commercial rights . associated with Formula 1 motor racing at a significant undervalue.' He suggested that if the judge ruled . in favour of Constantin on those issues then the company would have been . a 'victim of fraud' and entitled to compensation. Mr Marshall said Dr Gribkowsky was . given a jail term of more than eight years after being convicted of . corruption at a trial in Munich last year. Lawyers representing Mr Ecclestone have outlined their case to the judge in written arguments. 'This claim lacks any merit,' said Robert Miles QC. 'In short, this is an artificial, manufactured complaint.' He added: 'The claim fails on each of . its elements: there was no conspiracy, there was no intent to injure . Constantin ... Constantin has suffered no loss.' Mr Miles said in 2006 it had been . arranged that Dr Gribkowsky would be given a 'consultancy package' and . Mr Ecclestone received 'tax threats'. 'It was arranged that Dr Gribkowsky would be given a pay-off by way of consultancy package as he was requesting,' said Mr Miles. 'Mr Ecclestone agreed to a pay-off because of the tax threats and insinuations which he had received from Dr Gribkowsky.' The hearing continues.
