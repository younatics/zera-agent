"Warning: Tomasz Siemoniak said Russian naval and air force activity has reached 'unprecedented' levels around the Baltic region in recent days . Russian naval and air force activity has reached 'unprecedented' levels around the Baltic region in recent days, Poland's defence minister says. Tomasz Siemoniak said the majority of the incidents involved Russian operations in international waters, and that Sweden was the country most affected. Mr Siemoniak said Poland sees Russia's show of military strength primarily as an attempt to test Nato, adding that 'it doesn't help to build good relations and trust.' It comes after a number of claims by Nato states of Russian incursions including, just yesterday, fears that a Russian submarine had parked up just outside Scotland's Faslane naval base, home of Britain's nuclear arsenal. Mr Siemoniak spoke in an interview with TVN24, which said that on Monday Dutch F-16s taking part in Nato's Baltic Air policing mission intercepted two Russian Su-34 bombers. The Polish politician wouldn't give details of that incident, but said it was just 'one of many.' He said the issue would be discussed later in the day in Latvia with counterparts from the three Baltic states. The incident is just the latest in a number of aerial encounters between Russian and Nato jets. Last week the Norwegian military published dramatic footage of one of its pilots foced into an emergency manoeuvre to avoid a mid-air crash with a Russian fighter. 'The Russian pilot's behaviour was not quite normal,' said Norwegian armed forces spokesman Brynjar Stordal about the 26-second film clip of the encounter in international airspace 'north of Norway'. 'We don't know if it was a miscalculation or if he deliberately put himself in the path of our F-16,' said Stordal, adding that Norway's armed forces had informed Russia that the incident was 'undesirable'. Norway's complaint came just a day after Britain said it was concerned by a sharp increase in Russian military flights close to its borders which it said were designed to test its air defences. 'The extremely aggressive probing of our air space by Russian aircraft is an issue of concern to us,' British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond told a committee of lawmakers. 'It is entirely appropriate for NATO countries in particular to work together to respond to what is a change of Russia's dealings with NATO and indeed the non-NATO European countries.' Closely watched: RAF Typhoon jets were scrambled in October to track this Russian Tu-95 Bear H bomber, one of two which flew close to Britain without filing flight plans or communicating with air traffic controllers. Followed: These RAF images show the moment the aircraft were escorted by Typhoons near British airspace . The bombers which flew near Britain were just two of 26 Russian planes intercepted over Europe in 24 hours . Nato announced last month that it had scrambled warplanes 400 times so far this year in response to increased Russian air activity around Europe. Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the problem was not just where the Russians are flying but that they are not turning on their transponders or communicating. He said the flights - which have risen 50 percent over the last year - posed a risk to commercial air traffic, but admitted there had been 'very limited numbers of violations' of Nato air space. It came after it emerged Russia was resuming patrols by long-range strategic bombers in international airspace from the Arctic Ocean to the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico. Estonia's foreign ministry summoned Russia's ambassador yesterday after claiming a Russian plane had violated the country's air space. The Russian defense ministry denied it, saying the Russian military aircraft was making a routine flight from Moscow to the Russian Baltic Sea enclave of Kaliningrad 'in accordance with international rules for the use of airspace.' On Sunday, Nato said Russian military activity 'has been considerable' in recent months. It added, 'Such activity can be destabilising and potentially dangerous, if international norms are not respected.'","Majority of incidents involved Russian operations in international waters .

"A father and son who spent six years building a 38ft luxury yacht in their back garden had to hire a crane to hoist it over their own house after discovering it was too big to get out. Roofing business owner John Couzens, 53, and his 26-year-old son Dan worked up to 12 hours a day to finish the eight tonne boat worth £175,000 which boasts showers and two bedrooms. But when they found it was too heavy to wheel out of their 25ft high work shed, they invited the neighbours in Broadstairs, Kent, to watch the 15ft high vessel being lifted over their home. A father and son who spent six years building a 38ft yacht  had to hire a crane to hoist it over their house . Roofing business owner John Couzens, 53, and his 26-year-old son Dan worked up to 12 hours a day to finish the eight tonne boat . The father-of-four said watching the Evolution 38i boat, named Out Of The Blue, hovering over the roof of his £300,000 four-bedroom house  was a moment he will never forget. 'There was a moment when I thought - this could all go horribly wrong,' he said. 'It was so ridiculous watching it appear over the top of the house. But it was an incredible moment as well. He decided to create the 38ft by 5ft boat from scratch in a bid to give his 26-year-old son a project to focus on. A team of 10 construction workers helped transport the eight tonne boat worth more than £175,000 . To get the hull into the garden they constructed scaffolding and built a 25ft high work shed . Mr Couzens, his son Dan and their friends take delivery of the fibreglass base of the 45ft yacht . The finished boat was rolled out of the specially-constructed shed and was lifted by a crane . Now moored in Ramsgate Harbour, the boat will have to undergo a number of safety checks . Mr Couzens said the next big moment for the family will be taking it out to sea in a few months . 'Dan is one of these people who is just so gifted and whatever he puts his mind to he completes,' he said. 'He doesn't drink much and he has all this excess energy, so when he told me he needed a project six years ago we decided to think of something big. 'He had fixed up cars in the past but it was all over very quickly. Now moored in Ramsgate Harbour, the boat will have to undergo a number of safety checks and sea lessons before it can set sail. 'Getting it into the water was another momentous step because it didn't sink,' said the 53-year-old. 'We think it will take another four months to get everything sorted in terms of life-jackets and safety precautions. 'The next big moment for us as a family will be getting it out to sea. The father-of-four decided to create the 38ft by 5ft boat from scratch in a bid to give his 26-year-old son a project to focus on . The duo spent two years building a boat house measuring 45ft by 18ft in the back garden . Dan Couzens,  26, stood on the back of the luxury yacht which he spent six years building . 'You can sleep on it, eat on it and live on it, so hopefully we can have some wonderful times on it. 'I'm incredibly proud of Dan for his unwavering dedication to the project, it's been an amazing journey.' The duo first conceived the project in 2008 and took an eight-hour trip to Cornwall where they discovered the Evolution 38i hull. Realising they would need a would need a large indoor space to build the yacht, they set about constructing a boat house which measured 45 ft by 18ft. 'We were immediately blown away by it and so the process began,' said Mr Couzens. 'Getting the hull into the garden was a mission in itself and involved scaffolding and building a boat house. 'My wife Alison had to put up with that boat house for six years so I've promised her now it's in the water she can have a new kitchen.' Trained in lead, bronze and brass work, the duo spent months perfecting their project and the boat is now installed with a 500 horse power Cummins 8.3L diesel engine. Mr Couzens said: 'Dan's workmanship is amazing. He would be up for breakfast at 7:30, start work at 8, have a tea break at 10, lunch at 12, another tea break at 3 and then finish for dinner at 5. 'Everything is designed so intricately and there are so many features that are completely his design. It's a work of art.'

"A make-up artist has defied traditional beauty conventions by trading in his usual array of cosmetics in favor of a variety of everyday objects which he has used to transform the faces of his models. Dior ambassador Andrew Gallimore, who has previously worked with the likes of Lady Gaga and Cara Delevingne, teamed up with British fashion photographer Rankin in order to showcase the unique beauty looks, which make use of everything from string and paint to acrylic and even UV light. 'I'm always interested to see what you can decorate a face with, rather than just lipstick, powder, and pencils,' Gallimore told Refinery29. Scroll down for video . Strung together: Make-up artist Andrew Gallimore uses a variety of every day objects in order to create his weird and wonderful beauty looks . To the point: The Dior ambassador has worked with renowned British fashion photographer Rankin on dozens of shoots over the past few years . The renowned make-up artist has worked on a variety of shoots for Rankin's popular fashion magazine Hunger during the past few years, many of which have provided him with the perfect opportunity to experiment with his daring make-up alternatives. 'I really wanted to do a makeup shoot on boys that wasn’t drag, but it also wasn’t just messy,' he said of one shoot. 'We did one quite early on for Hunger, and I wanted it to be about light and how light reacts to things. 'I wanted him to look kind of like Predator. 'So, I airbrushed the majority of the face in UV paint, but we shot it with a UV light so it has this extra dimension of crazy.' Finding inspiration: Gallimore's work is influenced by all manner of things, from art exhibitions to the environment . Trip the light fantastic: The images also incorporate movement in order to offer added impact . When it comes to finding new and innovative beauty looks, Gallimore isn't short of ideas - and admits he has found inspiration in all manner of locations. '[I went] to an exhibition at the Tate in London, and I’d seen a sculpture with all these stringed pieces,' he says about one particular shoot. 'I loved the shadow they cast... I [wanted to] do that on a face and in color. So, we pulled some references on how a stained-glass window casts a colorful shadow. 'I thought about using photography gels for a similar effect, and we did a few different versions of that. Clowning around: The photographs were taken over a number of years and have been brought together for the first time in Rankin's new book entitled Andrew Gallimore . Another perspective: Gallimore enjoys 'decorating' faces, rather than just making them up with traditional beauty products . [The model was] painted white to get rid of the features, and then the gels were stuck on in a way that you get the proper effect.' After years of collaborating together, Rankin and Gallimore have now released a book which showcases the very best of their joint projects. Entitled Andrew Gallimore by Rankin, the artistic tome includes dozens of images of the make-up artist's most out-there beauty looks which Rankin sums up in one succinct sentence: 'You name it, we stuck it on them.","Dior ambassador Andrew Gallimore uses everything from string to crystals in order to create the eye-catching beauty looks .

"The head of of BBC TV has said he is prepared for BBC3 to lose viewers when it moves online in a bid to save £50million. The corporation has earmarked the station for a move to its iPlayer service from 2015, which it says would save millions to reinvest in other programming. If plans are approved, the channel will close and move completely online next autumn. But moves to effectively scrap the channel after 11 years has faced criticism from many of its stars, including Jack Whitehall, Dj Greg James and Richard Bacon, who started a Twitter protest to block the move. Danny Cohen, head of BBC TV, has admitted he expects BBC3 will lose viewers when it moves online in a bid to save £50million . The majority of the new, smaller budget - 80 per cent - will be spent on traditional comedy and documentaries. The remaining 20 per cent will be channeled into short films and digital media designed to draw in young viewers from sites including Tumblr, YouTube and Twitter. It will also allow the corporation to launch a BBC1 +1 channel and show two hours more of CBBC a night. BBC Director of Television Danny Cohen did not go into detail about which programmes would survive the move but the emphasis on comedy and documentary it could signal the end for entertainment shows including Don't Tell The Bride and Snow, Sex And Suspicious Parents. Mr Cohen told reporters: 'We expect an initial drop overall and that's why we want BBC1 and BBC2 to pick up the weight. It's also why we see this as a package in our proposal to the trust for a BBC1 +1, because we know those +1 channels are very important to people.' Mr Cohen said the BBC, mainly based at Media City (pictured), needed 'to learn, fail, learn again, innovate and succeed' to cope with the changing landscape where more people watch TV on computers and phones . The decision to axe BBC3 – which is expected to save around £100million a year – must be approved by the corporation’s governing body before it can go ahead. In 2010, the BBC was forced to abandon plans to axe Radio 6Music after its stars organised a vocal public protest. Mr Cohen said the BBC needed 'to learn, fail, learn again, innovate and succeed' to cope with the changing landscape where more people watch TV on computers and phones. Damian Kavanagh, who is in charge of putting the plan together, said: 'This 80/20 mix would extend and enhance the BBC3 experience and be of the moment, giving audiences more. 'It's a radical change for a TV channel to propose committing such a significant amount of its budget to non-TV content but I believe this will lead to greater innovation and allow us to engage with audiences for longer and more depth than ever before.' In recent years, the BBC has repeatedly come under fire for wasting money. The controversial IT project known as the Digital Media Initiative was axed by Lord Hall at a cost of £100million to the licence fee payer. And the corporation was castigated by MPs after a report by the National Audit Office discovered it had handed out £369million in severance payments to its staff over eight years. The plan to scrap the channel after 11 years has faced criticism from many of its stars, including Jack Whitehall (left), Dj Greg James and Richard Bacon (right), who started a Twitter protest to block the move . The BBC has earmarked BBC3 for a move to its iPlayer service from 2015, which it says would save millions to reinvest in other programming . The decision to move the channel is a controversial one - about 187,000 people signed an online petition opposing the move less than a week after the decision was made public. Jono Read, one of the organisers of a campaign to save the channel, said the announcement 'left a lot of questions still unanswered'. He said: 'The BBC Trust claimed that BBC3 was both diverse and young, and reached this audience better than any other BBC channel. Now the BBC admits it will see a drop in these audiences when it moves online. 'Why allow this audience to move elsewhere, and what happens if there's a significant drop? Will the BBC have a Plan B? 'We know that not everyone can get television online because of issues with broadband provision, particularly in rural areas, and the BBC is launching a BBC1+1 for that very reason, but for young people it's made the decision to take that content off our screens altogether. This somewhat defies logic.'","BBC has earmarked the station for a move to its iPlayer service from 2015 .

"A rhino was butchered for its single horn and left to die in a pool of it's own blood, in the Kaziranga National Park in India. Forestry workers discovered the dead animal's lifeless body in the Burapahar range in the north-eastern Assam state. Illegal rhinoceros horn poaching is one of the major environmental issues in the park, with animal body parts such as the toenails and skin having a high value on the Asian medicinal market. Scroll down for video . A rhino was butchered for its single horn and left to die in a pool of it's own blood, in the Kaziranga National Park in India, where it was later discovered by forestry workers . Indian forestry officials stand near the lifeless body of the one-horned rhinoceros in the park where illegal rhinoceros horn poaching is one of the major environmental issues . Poachers remove animal body parts such as the toenails, skin and horns, to sell to the Asian medicinal market . The Indian rhinoceros, also known as the one-horned rhino, is listed as a vulnerable species. The mammal is mostly found in the Assam state and in protected areas of Nepal. The one-horned rhino once ranged throughout the Indo-Gangetic Plain, but their numbers were greatly reduced by hunting. However, more than 3,000 are still thought to live in the wild, of which more than 2,500 are believed to be in Assam alone. There are five different species of rhinoceros, and all are threatened to some degree. Although poaching drastically reduced their numbers in the 1900s, numbers have steadily increased in recent years. Meanwhile, an experiment hoped to produce a rhino calf by relocating three endangered rhinos from a Czech Republic Zoo to East Africa, has all but failed. Keeper Mohamed Doyo pats female northern white rhino Najin in her pen where she is being kept for observation at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya; the keepers of three of the last six northern white rhinos in existence have said the mammals will never produce a calf naturally and that they are now relying on in vitro fertilisation to produce a calf and save the species from extinction . The keepers of three northern white rhinos in Kenya - half of the world's remaining rhinos of that species - have said for the first time that their one male and two female rhinos will certainly not reproduce naturally. This means the species may be doomed to extinction. However, it is hoped science can play a part and save the species. Scientists will try and use in vitro fertilisation, and work with the rhinos' genetic material, in a budding field known as de-extinction. The conservancy said in a statement todaythat artificial reproductive techniques 'could provide the last chance of survival for the world's most endangered mammal.'","The Kaziranga National Park in India is a hunting ground for poachers .

"Nina Pham still doesn't know exactly how she contracted Ebola, but the intensive care unit nurse says she has no regrets about treating Liberian Thomas Duncan. Ms Pham was one of the ICU nurses at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas responsible for the care of Mr Duncan, who died from the virus in October. She and fellow nurse Amber Vinson both contracted and survived Ebola, but neither are sure how they were exposed to it. But just six weeks after the 26-year-old was declared Ebola-free, the modest nurse insists she is not a hero and was 'just doing [her] job'. Ebola survivor Nina Pham, an ICU nurse at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, says she is not a hero . Now looking much healthier, Ms Pham is among the Ebola fighters recognized by Time magazine as their 'Person of the Year'. 'I would just say that I did my job,' she told Khou.com. 'I had a patient that needed my help, and I was going to help him.' But speaking about the moment she was told she had Ebola, she said: 'I thought it was a death sentence; flashbacks to Mr Duncan's disease and how it progressed eventually to his death came to mind.' She recalled a CDC doctor and her chief nursing officer approaching her in hazmat suits - and she knew from their faces the news was bad. And she admits she still suffers from nightmares about treating Mr Duncan, and about dying. Despite surviving the deadly disease, she still struggles with fatigue and worries about the lasting effects of the experimental drug she was given. But luckily, Ms Pham can rely on fellow nurse Amber Vinson for emotional support. Ms Pham contracted Ebola after caring for Liberian Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, who died from Ebola in October . But despite people being afraid of her and the critics who questioned the decision to save her dog, who was feared to have also been exposed to the virus, Ms Pham has no regrets. Her dog Bentley was placed in quarantine for 21 days but she says many people commented that he should have been put down just in case. She adds people have been afraid of her, including not wanting to shake her hand in church, even after health officials declared her free of the virus. And although she is not sure whether she will return to nursing, Ms Pham would gladly donate her blood to another Ebola patient if necessary. Announcing Time magazine's prestigious title yesterday, editor Nancy Gibbs said: 'The rest of the world can sleep at night because a group of men and women are willing to stand and fight. On Wednesday, 'the Ebola fighters' were named as TIME's Person of the Year 2014. The magazine is putting out five front covers to honor the fighters, including Dr Kent Brantly, left, and Dr Jerry Brown, right . 'For tireless acts of courage and mercy, for buying the world time to boost its defenses, for risking, for persisting, for sacrificing and saving, the Ebola fighters are Time's 2014 Person of the Year.' The White House welcomed the accolade as a tribute to the ""heroism and selflessness"" of countless health care workers fighting the worst Ebola outbreak in history. 'The administration, including the president, could not be prouder of the brave men and women who've committed themselves to this effort in a foreign land,' said spokesman Josh Earnest. 'These are men and women who deserve international recognition, and today we are pleased that they're receiving more of it.' President Barack Obama has made an effort to calm hysteria in the United States over how Ebola is contracted by welcoming survivors to the White House. After surviving her ordeal, Ms Pham was welcomed to the Oval Office in October and hugged by the President. The worst ever Ebola outbreak has left more than 6,300 people dead worldwide, nearly all in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia.

"For years this favela in Brazil was controlled by the brutal Third Command drugs gang who ran extortion rackets, imposed curfews, and kept the terrified population in line with violence. Almost a quarter of the homes in the in Chapéu Mangueira and Babilônia neighbourhood, built with whatever materials the poor residents could get their hands on,  still have no running water or electricity. But for one night only 11 girls from this hillside shanty town in Rio de Janiero were able to forget the misery of their daily lives and become princesses at their very own debutante ball. Scroll down for video . Eleven girls from one of Brazil's poorest favelas were treated to a debutante ball organised by local police and a team of volunteers . The girls were given makeovers and dressed up in gowns that were loaned to them from nearby shops to provide a fairytale evening . Galmour: The event took place at an upmarket tennis club in one of the wealthy districts close to the favela where they live . Eleven girls from one of Brazil's most deprived favelas were taken to a traditional debutante ball by local police who helped to organise it along with a team of volunteers . One girl tears up as her police escort puts a ring on her finger during a debutante ball organised by local authorities . A team of volunteers was brought in to give the girls a full makeover, while ball gowns were loaned from local shops to make their night of magic complete. The ball was held at an upmarket tennis club which lent its services for the occasion, while the girls were accompanied by officers from the local Police Protection Units. Like most of Brazil's poorest neighbourhoods, Chapéu Mangueira and Babilônia are bordered by some of the most expensive in the world. Just a few streets from where these girls live, families will regularly spend up to $50,000 to give their daughters the perfect ball to mark their  15th birthday. The girls often wear three dresses: one to greet guests in, one to waltz in, and another less restricting one to dance the night away in. Emotional: Two young women embrace after arriving at the venue for their debutante ball, put on by local police who are hoping to rebuild trust in communities and break up gangs who had taken control . Some of the girls are reduced to teas after arriving at an upmarket tennis club in Rio that volunteered its premises for their ball . Celebration: Many of these girls' families will survive on $30 or less a week, meaning even a modest party is far beyond their reach . The debutante ball, which takes place on a girl's 15th birthday, has a strong tradition in Brazil, with many spending thousands on the event . This favela used to be run by a brutal drug cartel, with the police occasionally raiding their stongholds before retreating. Now a local force lives and works there 24/7, and helps to organise events such as this one . It is tradition for each party to have a theme, and some parents will hire event coordinators and designers to try and outshine the others. In the favelas, the average family survives on just $30 a week, putting even a modest celebration well beyond their reach. The favela debutante ball was part of new efforts to regain control of the slums around Rio from drug gangs by building trust in the local police forces. The Protection Units represent a new tactic in Brazil's fight against organised crime. Previously, heavily armed officers would raid the city's poorest districts, battle with drug gangs, arrest as many of them as possible, then leave. Girls sit around in a nearby hotel while a team of volunteers help them into their dresses and do their hair and makeup for them . One girl from Rio's Chapéu Mangueira and Babilônia favela has her hair done by a volunteer alongside a female police officer who helped to organise the event . The ball is run by the Police Protection Unit who live and work in the favela 24 hours a day in order to reclaim the streets from the Third Command drug gang who used to operate there . Hundreds of homes in the Chapéu Mangueira and Babilônia favelas are without power or running water, but for one night these girls were allowed to forget their daily lives and celebrate . Young debutantes help each other to prepare for their debutante ball in the Windsor Atlantica hotel in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil . Police forces help to put on the balls in order to rebuild trust in communities whose only contact with officers up until that point was during armed raids on violent drug gangs in their neighbourhoods . But for residents caught in the cross fire this bread mistrust, even hatred of the authorities, and meant they were unwilling to work with officers. By contrast the protection units live and work in the favelas full time, replacing the drug gangs as everyday enforcers of law on the streets. While it has not eliminated the problem of gangs completely, it means they cannot operate in the open, and drives down violence which had become an everyday occurrence here. It also allows girls like these to enjoy one night away from all of their troubles and take part in the tradition of the debutante ball. Dresses were loaned out to the girls from local shops, while volunteers helped to do their makeup and hair . While many Brazilian families will spend up to $50,000 on their daughter's 15th birthday ball, families in the slums live on $30 a week, putting even a modest party beyond their reach .

"This is the pretty brunette is accused of throwing a punch during the charity boxing match . This is the face of a pretty brunette wanted by police after punches were thrown during a mass brawl at a police charity boxing match. The woman is alleged to have thrown a punch after the violence erupted in the audience at  Wolverhampton's Civic Hall. Three men were arrested on suspicion of affray at the scene of the fundraiser - which had seen a police boxing team take on members from a local boxing club. The trouble started at around 11pm after an argument broke out between some audience members which led to punches being thrown in the crowd. West Midlands Police have now released an image of a woman they want to speak to in connection with the disorder. The attractive brunette - who can be seen in formal wear smiling at the camera on the night of the event - is believed to have swung at least one punch during the fracas on October 18. Detective Constable Narinder Sandhu, from West Midlands Police, said: 'This was an event to raise money for a disability charity - between a police boxing team and a group of local boxers - and it is a shame that some members of the audience decided to start their own match outside of the ring. 'We've arrested a number of people already in connection with the offence and two others have been voluntarily interviewed about it. 'There is one woman though who we suspect may have also thrown a punch during the disorder. 'Despite our best efforts, we have been unable to identify her and I would urge anyone who knows her to get in touch.' Police said nobody came forward to say they were hurt but a number of people reported witnessing the violence - causing them to fear for their safety. Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101 or the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

"Jessie Roach is 31 years old and has mental disabilities that are so severe he cannot read and receives disability payments from the federal government. And yet, last month, he was allowed to step into the ring at a Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Harley-Davidson dealership with a veteran fighter - who drove him to the bout and promised to pay him $50 and give him a medal. Jesse Rowell, a champion jiu jitsu wrestler and veteran mixed martial arts fighter, knocked Roach out in 47 seconds with a savage blow to the head. Blow to the head: This is the moment Jesse Rowell, an experienced fighter and a gym owner, knocked out mentally disabled Jessie Roach with a brutal kick to the head . Roach (left) and Rowell (right) had fought previously in a mixed martial arts match. It ended with Roach being knocked out . Rowell left without giving Roach the medal or cash he promised, Roach says. He was also left with no way home. This is the brutal, cruel world of unregulated amateur kickboxing. The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reveals that such fights - unlike boxing and mixed martial arts - are not regulated by the state of Wisconsin. Last March, 24-year-old Dennis Munson Jr. died after being knocked out in his debut kickboxing match at the Milwaukee Eagles Club, the Journal-Sentinel revealed. 'He was basically preyed upon. It is unethical. What is the difference between doing that and using a kid to fight?' Jim Hoegemeier, director of the Arc-Wisconsin Disability Association, told the newspaper. Experts told the newspaper that Roach would never have been allowed to participate in a state-sanctioned fight - and certainly not against the veteran Rowell. Within hours Rowell's fight last month, he posted pictures and video of the knockout blow. He even made the brutal image his Facebook profile picture. Roach's Facebook page also includes pictures of the flight. Roach was never examined by a doctor before the fight - which took place in front of hundreds of cheering fans who paid $80 each to watch fight that evening. He signed a release waiver - but Roach's family says his dyslexia is so severe that he can't read. Someone read the paper to him, but he said he didn't understand. He told the Journal-Sentinel that he thought he was putting his name on a signup sheet. Roach (left) can't read or write. Rowell (right) says the fight was 'just for fun' and wasn't serious . When the time for the fight came, Roach told the newspaper, he thought he would be wrestling. He didn't even know it was a kickboxing match. Rowell met Roach through a mutual friend who had been training Roach in UFC-style fighting in his basement. Rowell has previously fought Roach in a mixed martial arts fight years ago, before the state regulated that, as well. Roach was knocked out in the first round. Rowell, who has owned a kickboxing gym for five years, defended the fight and told the Journal Sentinel that he had no idea that Roach was mentally disabled. 'You gotta remember, people are punch-drunk all the time, so I thought he was just that,' Rowell . 'I didn't sit down and talk to him.' He claimed the bound was 'just for fun' and was meant to be a sparring match, not a real fight. He denies promising Roach cash or a medal, but admits he gave him a ride to the fight. Roach, for his part, got $50 from the fight promoter out of sympathy. But he still wants his medal.","Jesse Rowell owns a kickboxing gym and is a champion jiu jitsu wrestler .

"Good Samaritans have rescued an abandoned puppy after she was found covered in blood and left for dead in a tied-up trash bag. Karen Herrera was walking through her neighborhood in Fontana, California two days before Thanksgiving when she heard whimpering in a nearby field. She followed the sound to a trash bag and opened it to find a small puppy with patchy fur. 'She was scared and cold,' Herrera told KTLA. 'I patted her on the back of her spine and she was bleeding.' Scroll down for video . Found: A puppy, named Gladys by her rescuers, is on the mend after being left for dead in a bag . Discovery: A passerby heard the dog whimpering and found her inside this tied-up trash bag in a field . Herrera called the police and another nearby resident wrapped the dog in a blanket as they waited for animal services to arrive, the Fontana Police Department said. Animal Services Officers took the dog to an animal hospital and learned that the animal, who they named Gladys, was suffering from bite marks and Mange, a treatable skin disease. Gladys is now recovering at Sunshine Haven Animal Rescue and Rehabilitation, where staff say bites on her head suggests she was used as a victim dog used to train pit bulls for attacks. 'When she came in, she was kind of depressed, she was this sad dog that doesn't move much,' Karolyn Vervill told KTLA. Hero: Karen Herrera discovered the dog in the tied-up bag while on a walk two days before Thanksgiving . Scared: Herrera said that Gladys, pictured after she was found, was scared and had blood on her back . Treatment: She was taken to an animal hospital where staff found she was covered in bite marks and Mange . But she is going from strength-to-strength and making friends with the other dogs. She is expected to recover fully in the next few months and will be put up for adoption. Authorities do not know who dumped the dog but are appealing for anyone with information to call the Fontana Police Department anonymous hotline at 909-356-TIPS. 'It is a felony in California to subject any animal to unjustifiable suffering and neglect,' Fontana Animal Services Supervising Officer Jamie Simmons said. 'If you cannot afford veterinary care there are other options such as rescue groups, local shelters, or humane euthanasia through a licensed veterinarian to prevent its suffering.' Sad: When she first arrived at the rescue center, staff noticed that she seemed depressed and withdrawn . Improving: A before (left) and after (right) shot shows how the puppy's skin is improving since she was found .

"We've all been there - the big smiles on a night out, followed by the horror the following day at Facebook pictures revealing a wobbly chin, dark eye bags or mouth wrinkles. After one such morning, Diane Clarke decided to take action - booking herself in for £15,000 of plastic surgery and Botox, so that she would never again take a bad selfie. The 63-year-old from Milton Keynes used to hate looking at photos of herself because she looked much older than her young friends. Diane Clarke, 63, from Milton Keynes used to hate looking at pictures of herself, so she spent thousands on botox and a face lift. Now she documents her new face with a selfie every day. After being horrified by her wrinkles in a picture at a friend's wedding, she decided that expensive face cream was no longer enough and that she wanted to go under the knife. Diane has now spent a total of £15,000 on facelifts and botox in order to roll back the years. To celebrate her new youthful looks, she takes a selfie of her younger-looking face each day. She said: 'When you have pics taken from afar, the camera is more forgiving, but I wanted to look good close up too. 'Seeing photos of me compared to my other friends made me feel so insecure. I looked so old but still felt young inside. 'I hated my crow's feet and when I compared myself to my friends in pictures, they all looked so much younger than me.' Diane has now spent a total of £15,000 on facelifts and botox in order to roll back the years (here she is pre-surgey) She continued: 'I remember walking past a shop window and catching a glimpse of my reflection in it and thinking I looked like my mother. It was horrifying. 'No amount of face cream was ever going to fix those wrinkles. Going under the knife was the only option if I wanted to look as young as I feel. 'The surgeon said he could turn back the clock by at least five years and I was more than happy with that. 'It may have cost £15,000 for a facelift and botox but it was worth it for the perfect selfie.' Diane, from Milton Keynes, Bucks., started botox in 2004 at Aurora Clinics in High Wycombe when she was 53. Despite returning twice a year, costing £170 a time, Diane was shocked at how old she looked when she was photographed at a friend's wedding in September 2009. Since the surgery, Diane is delighted with the compliments she gets on her youthful looks . In January 2013, she made the decision to pay £5,000 to go under the knife so that she could take the perfect selfie. The procedure, called a minimal access cranial suspension facelift, meant two cuts were made in front of each of Diane's ears before the skin was pulled back. She added: 'One particular photo of me at a wedding just tipped me over the edge. 'When I looked at the picture I was horrified. I looked so old and wrinkly, I just couldn't believe it was me. 'Coming around (from the surgery), it was quite funny to see my face all bandaged up. At first I questioned what I had done.' In January 2013, she made the decision to pay £5,000 to go under the knife so that she could take the perfect selfie. Here Diane is pre-surgery (left) and post-surgery (right) She continued: 'But as soon as I was out of hospital and the bandages were off, I was pointing the camera at myself. 'Flicking through my folder of selfies, I was absolutely amazed to see I looked about eight years younger. 'I hadn't told any of my friends that I was having it done, so when they saw me they were all so shocked and kept showering me with compliments. 'They were all so impressed that the surgeon had managed to iron me out. '£5,000 isn't much to pay to look good in photos.' Since the surgery, Diane - a retired university PA - has continued to have botox twice a year to 'top up' her face. Diane is also considering having a second face lift to look even sharper in snaps . She is also considering having a second face lift to look even sharper in pictures. She added: 'I know some people might say I've been to extreme lengths for the perfect selfie. I do feel very vain but taking selfies is so addictive.' Her plastic surgeon Adrian Richards, of Aurora Clinics, said: 'Modern technologies like selfies are causing us to think and feel differently about our appearance. '21st century devices and applications are showing us how we actually look, rather than how we think we look.

"A political row erupted today over whether parents should be able to smack their children. Tory Education Secretary Nicky Morgan insisted people should be free to choose how they discipline their sons and daughters. But Labour's Ed Balls argued 'it is wrong to smack children' while Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg insisted every parent loses their temper sometimes. And Sky News presenter Colin Brazier grew so exasperated at student Tim Doble saying parents should never touch their child in anger that he slapped him on the hand and told him he was 'talking out of your backside'. Scroll down for video . Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said parents should choose how to discipline their children, but Labour's Ed Balls said smacking was never acceptable . Under the law, there is no ban on smacking and parents are allowed to use 'reasonable chastisement'. However, they are not allowed to hit a child with an implement or so hard that it leaves a mark, or causes bruising, swelling, cuts, grazes or scratches. It can be the source of fierce debate in Westminster and in households across the country about whether smacking is ever acceptable, and whether it should be banned in law. Mrs Morgan, who was being grilled by schoolchildren on TV, insisted that there was a difference between a 'light tap' and inflicting serious pain. She said: 'I don't want to criminalise parents if that's the decision that they take to discipline their child. 'There's what we have called reasonable chastisement. I don't know whether it is just a tap on the hand or a mild smack on the bottom but, I think, as politicians, we struggle with this all the time - when does government make a decision or when do we allow parents or carers to make that decision?' She was taking questions from readers of childrens' newspaper First News for the Hotseat show on Sky News. The mother-of-one said the government should not be in the business of telling people how to bring up their children. But she added: 'There has to be a line, when we say, no, that is a line that you have crossed and that is a child that now needs support from other people... there have been some terrible cases where children have been abused and some, sadly, killed even by their own parents.' Sky News host Colin Brazier grabbed Tom Doble's hand during a live debate and slapped him . Mr Doble was arguing against smacking, but Mr Brazier said that as someone who does not have children 'you are talking out of your backside' A senior Sky News host today slapped a guest on the hand during a heated debate on whether parents should smack their children. Colin Brazier appeared to grow increasingly exasperate with guest Tim Doble, a student who was arguing parents should not have physical contact with their child in anger. Mr Doble said: 'In the heat of the moment... you cannot justify a really terrible action just because you are stressed with some sort of difficulty with your child. 'If you are a parent, your responsibility is not to lose your cool with your child.' Mr Brazier repeatedly argued that parents often find themselves in an impossible situation and a small tap could help to bring children in line, before reaching out at taking Mr Doble by the hand. The presenter, who has six children under the age of 14 with his wife Jo, told him that many parents would think: 'Until you have been there, you are talking out of your backside.' Later in the debate he reassured Mr Doble that it was a one-off, joking: 'I'm not going to do it again Tim, don't run away.' Mr Doble later took to Twitter to hit back at his critics, claiming he was being 'trolled' by viewers who disagreed with him. Mr Doble is a student at the University of London and a contributor to Sky News' Stand Up and Be Counted campaign . He later took to Twitter to hit back at critics to targeted him with criticism after his TV appearance . Mrs Morgan was backed by her coalition colleague, Mr Clegg, who said he had not smacked his three boys but would not judge parents struggling with a disobedient child. The Lib Dem Deputy Prime Minister said there 'isn't a simple legalistic answer on what the state tells parents to do'. Speaking on his weekly LBC radio phone-in, he stressed that violence against children is 'abhorrent' and against the law, but disciplining children is 'a slightly different thing'. He revealed his own parenting woes: 'I've had this, you have got one of your kids playing up badly in a supermarket, you pull them by the arm so they don't pull all the baked bean tins down off the shelf. Is that reasonable chastisement? 'We shouldn't pretend it is easy that you can set down in a law… the point at which physical between a parent and a child which can sometimes be, well hang on a minute you have got to get in the car, or pick them up or whatever. 'When does that become unreasonable chastisement?' He insisted that he has never smacked his sons, Miguel, Antonio and Alberto. 'It's not something I do. I have certainly not smacked my boys across the back of the legs, no I haven't. 'I'm incredibly adamant that no parent should ever make themselves a paragon of virtue. 'Have I ever lost my patience with my kids? Of course I have. Which parent has not? Any parent who claims they have been angelically patient… yeah right. 'There isn't a simple legalistic answer on what the state tells parents to do. 'But I think we should all as parents and as a society always in the way we treat our own children and other children, treat them with passion and dignity and kindness, love, gentleness.' Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said all parents lose their patience with their children sometimes . However Mr Balls, Labour's shadow chancellor, insisted parents should never smack their children. 'I think parents shouldn't smack children. I think schools shouldn't smack children. I think we should say it is wrong to smack children, because if you start to say its ok then it starts to encourage in which the question is: 'how hard?' Mr Balls has one son and two daughters with fellow Labour frontbencher Yvette Cooper. He stressed that smacking is 'a bad way to bring up children' but he did not think the law needed to be changed. 'I think the law is already pretty tough, and somebody who smacks and marks and hurts a child, of course they should be punished,' he told Sky News. While he has not smacked his own children, he had regretted grabbing them. 'There have been times where if you are standing on the edge of trying to cross a road and your child suddenly leaps out and you pull them back, and you say on the hand 'don't do that again,' and afterwards I will probably think to myself that wasn't the right thing to do. 'But in those tense situations sometimes parents do, and I don't like to do it. I have done it myself; I don't think it's the right thing to do and I don't think you should make that illegal, I think that would be wrong. I think the law is good at the moment.' An NSPCC spokesman said: 'The NSPCC does not want to see parents criminalised for smacking but it is never a good way to discipline a child. 'There are much better ways to encourage good behaviour. Hitting children also teaches them that violence is acceptable and lashing out in anger can also be risky as parents could unwittingly injure their children.'","Education Secretary Nicky Morgan challenged by children about smacking .

"Have you ever watched The Jeremy Kyle Show, when some loser is exposed by a lie detector as a cheat. The details of how he slept with someone else behind his wife’s back are made public, and the audience boo him. And then they jeer and laugh as he declares he still loves his wife and never stopped loving her. Frank Lampard is due an appearance on Jezza’s show soon because of what happened at the Etihad at the weekend. 'I cheated on Chelsea – but I still love that club!' A Kyle audience would hound him off the stage: but football fans are so over-emotional they swallow this garbage. One of the great things about Lampard’s goal against Chelsea on Sunday is that this myth that a professional footballer can love a club has been exploded and hopefully no fan will ever be so naïve they embarrass themselves by spouting such nonsense ever again. Manchester City midfielder Frank Lampard applauds the Chelsea supporters at the Etihad on Sunday . Lampard scores the equaliser past Thibaut Courtois in Manchester City's 1-1 draw with Chelsea . Lampard is due an appearance on The Jeremy Kyle Show after scoring against Chelsea at the weekend . The general rule is that players play for whoever will pay them the most. 'I love this club, I never wanted to leave,' actually translates as: 'I was going to leave but they increased my money so I stayed.' It’s not a problem, unless a player tries to convince us they love a club. In Lampard’s case he didn’t want to leave Chelsea, but he had no choice – the club didn’t want to keep him. But that doesn’t mean he should agree to go to Manchester City on loan where he knows he is likely to play against Chelsea. Who knows how the season will pan out, but that goal Lampard scored at the Etihad might be crucial. If Manchester City pip Chelsea to the title by a point in May then it will be Lampard’s equaliser that will be remembered as a massive moment that helped deny Chelsea the title. So how can Lampard claim to love a club when that club is denied two points by a goal he has scored? That goal potentially, damages Chelsea’s chances of winning the title for the first time since 2010. Every fan of a football club knows exactly what I’m talking about. If you love a club, you don’t do anything to damage their chances of being successful. Lampard is a legend with the Chelsea fans after his 13-year spell at Stamford Bridge . Chelsea fans showed their appreciation with a banner honouring Lampard at the Etihad Stadium . Lampard said: 'I didn’t expect to come on and score.' Really? Chelsea’s all-time top scorer, a man who’s biggest strength throughout his career has been his ability to score goals, is brought on with Man City losing 1-0, and he didn’t expect to score? I appreciate it’s sometimes difficult after a game for a player to find the right thing to say. And ultimately I’m not criticising Lampard for playing the game and scoring a goal – it’s what he does best of course. But this should be a lesson to all professional footballers: only the most gullible fans will swallow your nonsense about your 'love' for their club. You can’t love a club and then score against them – no amount of applauding those fans afterwards will take that goal away. Lampard loved his time at Chelsea, he loved the support of the fans he had at Stamford Bridge. But he can’t love Chelsea and then score such a big goal against them. Lampard (right) scores the equaliser for Manchester City as Chelsea captain John Terry shows his dismay . Lampard acknowledges the crowd but tones down his celebration after scoring against his old club . VIDEO I told Lampard to score - Pellegrini . At the risk of returning to the Jeremy Kyle analogy again, it’s in Lampard’s DNA to score goals; as he said after the game: 'I’m just doing my job.' I respect Lampard for that. But people who love a football club give up work to show that love and watch them. They don’t 'just do their job', damage them, and then still profess love. Lampard can do what he wants – play for who he wants, and score for who he wants. But he’s mugged off Chelsea fans massively here. If it is true love he wouldn’t dream of playing against them, especially not a title rival. He didn’t have to join Man City but he did. And as soon as he did that, as Mourinho said, 'The love stories are over.' And the Chelsea fans with their Frank Lampard banners at the Etihad looked like the man on the Kyle show who walked in on his missus in bed with another bloke. 'I can forgive everything!' he desperately cries, as the rest of the world cringes for him.","Frank Lampard scored the equaliser in Manchester City's 1-1 draw with Chelsea on Sunday .

"David Jones is considering starting its Boxing Day sales one week early to boost sales in a move that could force rival Myer to follow suit. A source in the retail industry said the department store was preparing sale stock to put in stores ahead of Christmas due to slow sales in the past few weeks, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. This comes as New South Wales Planning Minister Pru Goward has taken the step of allowing shops in business districts in the CBD, Bondi Junction and western suburbs to stay open 24/7 until Christmas in order to help retailers pick up their sales.

Both David Jones and Myer are already offering deals on certain items, with David Jones currently offering 20 per cent off a range of home appliances, 40 per cent off Christmas wrapping and dinnerware, and other discounts on items including TVs, books, kitchenware and linen. Myer is holding a 'Super Weekend' this weekend with discounts on electrical appliances, homewares and clothing. This also comes after consumer sentiment hit a three-year low this December, down 5.7 percent from 96.6 in November to 91.1 in December. Westpac chief economist Bill Evans said this was a 'very disturbing result'. 'This is a particularly awkward time for respondents to feel so downbeat about purchasing major items given that it comes in the critical lead up weeks to Christmas,' Mr Evans said. Myer is expected to follow suit if David Jones starts its clearance sales early, industry sources say . This also comes consumer sentiment hit a three-year low this December . Commonwealth Bank economist Diana Mousina said this was in line with analysis they had done about Christmas shopping, which showed spending during the festive season would be down from $18.4 billion in 2013 to $17.8 billion in 2014. The bank's National Consumer Expenditure survey showed shoppers would spend $300 million less on Christmas gifts and $100 million less on Boxing Day sales this year. 'Based on anecdotes from retailers, and just compared to a year ago and on usual Christmas sales it's just not happening as much as they would like,' Ms Mousina said. 'It's an issue of competition in the market, there are a lot of new entrants into clothing and footwear retail at the moment. '[Stores] are just thinking of strategies to mitigate that.'

"Hoisted 250ft in the air on the end of a tangle of ropes, Sir David Attenborough shows you’re never too old for a tricky camera shot. The 88-year-old naturalist has had a knee replacement and a heart pacemaker fitted but none of that was going to stop his latest assignment – filming a huge bat colony in Borneo. Filming Sky series Conquest of the Skies, Sir David travelled to the Gomantong cave in Borneo, home to around a million bats that emerge in a huge flock each dusk to go hunting for insects. Hoisted 250ft in the air, Sir David Attenborough shows you’re never too old for a tricky camera shot . For this spectacular sequence, shot in 3D, he was winched up on a rope pulley and spoke to a camera fixed to a flying drone known as an ‘octocopter’. Sir David said: ‘In the cave you can feel the pressure build as bats emerge from the depths, from up to a mile away in the blackness. 'They gather in an chamber just before the entrance and the crowd grows bigger and bigger into a huge maelstrom, almost a whirlpool of bats, wanting to get out to feed on the insects but not daring to while it’s still daylight because there are bat hawks out there. ‘Eventually one makes a break for it, and then they all go out, thousands of them, finding safety in numbers because there only about five bat hawks.’ He may have had a knee replacement and a heart pacemaker fitted but none of that was going to stop his latest assignment – filming a huge bat colony in Borneo while hoisted in the air on a system of ropes (pictured) Sir David is known for his hands-on approach in his documentaries - pictured here with meerkats for Life Story . He added: ‘I have been in the Gomantong bat cave before, but this time was a highlight: I was winched on ropes 250 feet above the cave floor, and with the octocopter in front of me, did a piece to camera with a million bats flying past on their way out of the cave to hunt.’ Over the course of the series, Sir David travels to China, Rome, Scotland, Ecuador and Borneo to analyse gliding reptiles, parachuting mammals, acrobatic insects and exotic birds. Sir David has continued to work in the wake of the death of his brother, filmmaker Richard Attenborough, in August. Last year, he was forced to pull out of a tour of Australia while he had a pacemaker fitted to his heart, but he later said the operation was ‘no big deal’. The year before, he had a knee replaced, and he has admitted he finds it hard to walk for more than 15 minutes at a stretch. But he told Radio Times at the time: ‘I don’t ever want to stop work. 'Sure, something’s going to wear out some time and I won’t be able to do it, but while I can – and people want me to, and people look at the result – I’m delighted to work. ‘If I was earning my money by hewing coal I would be very glad indeed to stop.

"A 20-year-old Minnesota college student has died from hypothermia after she collapsed on the way home to her dorm after a night out drinking. Bemidji State University junior Sandra Lommen was found unconscious but breathing at 8.30am on Wednesday morning in a wooded area of Bemidji showing signs of intoxication and hypothermia. She was rushed to hospital but never regained consciousness and police believe she wandered off the road and fell through the ice that had frozen over the creek. Scroll Down for Video . Tragic: Sandra Lommen was found barely conscious on Wednesday morning after trying to walk home from a party two miles from her dorm . Tragically, police in Bemidji said they believe she managed to get herself out of the creek, but succumbed to the cold afterwards, passed out and was pronounced dead at Sanford Medical Center. Police also announced that a criminal investigation has been launched because Lommen was believed to be drunk and was under 21. The popular freshman was enrolled in nursing school and police are keen to talk to whoever was at the party she attended on Tuesday night. The student lived less than two miles from where she was found in the woods and was 'dressed appropriately for what she had intended to do, which was walk home,” said Police Chief Mike Mastin. On being transported to hospital, Mastin said he detected an odour of alcohol on her breath. Addressing the media, he said this just shows young people that 'you need to take care of youself' while drinking and walking home in the cold. Found: Sandra was found near to this creek and rushed to hospital where she was unfortunately pronounced dead . 'There is a family that just lost their 20-year-old daughter, and that’s just huge,' he said according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune. 'The parents were up here last night, and I met with them. It’s so very hard on them. 'I have two daughters myself. It’s tough.' In a tragic last Twitter post, Lommen posted this message, 'Make life fun, tomorrow isn't guaranteed.' On Wednesday evening, BSU President Richard Hanson released a statement to the campus community about Lommen’s death. “I offer my deepest condolences to Sandra’s family and to all those in our community who knew and cared for her,” Hanson said.","Sandra Lommen was found in a wooded area of  Bemidji, Minnesota .

"Demands were growing last night for a judge-led inquiry into Britain’s complicity in torture after a day of drama at Westminster. Three days after a US Senate report revealed details of the CIA’s barbaric interrogation techniques, MPs demanded answers to disturbing questions about the UK’s role. Senior figures from all major parties said the full truth must be known about the role played by British agents – and what the Blair Government knew about it. In a significant development, Nick Clegg broke ranks to say a full judicial inquiry may be needed. Scroll down for video . Nick Clegg (pictured) yesterday declared a full judicial inquiry may be needed to establish Britain's complicity in the US torture programme . It was also revealed that Home Secretary Theresa May secretly met with the Senate intelligence committee amid claims the Government frantically ‘lobbied’ to keep Britain out of the damning report. On a day of fast-moving developments, it emerged that: . The Senate committee's report revealed gruesome details about the CIA's torture programme, but all references to its allies such as Britain were redacted. Pictured is a group of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay . Pressure has been mounting since Tuesday for Britain to hold its own inquiry to uncover the unvarnished truth about its role in the so-called ‘war on terror’. The Senate committee revealed the most gruesome details about the CIA’s torture programme, but all references to the role played by America’s allies – including Britain – were redacted, despite them being passed information gleaned from the inhumane treatment. The explosive 499-page report did not contain a single reference to MI5, MI6 or Diego Garcia – the British base from which rendition flights are known to have taken place. In advance of its publication, there were 22 meetings between the Senate committee and the UK’s ambassador to Washington. It has now emerged Mrs May, who has oversight of MI5, also met with the committee. Home Secretary Theresa May, who has oversight of MI5, met with the Senate committee prior to the report's publication . Crucially, Lord West – who was the security minister in the last Labour Government – also held talks. The spotlight is particularly intense on Labour, which was in power during the duration of the CIA ‘enhanced interrogation’ programme between 2001 and 2007. There are huge questions over not only what Mr Blair personally knew, but also the roles played by ex-Foreign Secretaries Jack Straw and David Miliband. Yesterday, Ed Miliband – who still has a strained relationship with his elder brother after beating him to the Labour leadership – said David would ‘never’ have knowingly allowed British agents to become involved in rendition and torture programmes run by the CIA. Asked whether his brother had questions to answer, Mr Miliband said: ‘He answered questions about this in the House of Commons while he was in government. ‘He is never somebody who would ever countenance the British state getting engaged in this kind of activity.’ Significantly, however, he described the Senate report as ‘deeply troubling’ – and declined to defend Mr Blair. Mr Miliband stopped short of backing calls for a judge-led inquiry – which could be hugely embarrassing for his brother – but last night MPs on all sides said only a full investigation could get to the truth. David Cameron originally supported a judge-led inquiry and appointed Sir Peter Gibson to take charge. However, amid huge controversy, the inquiry was scrapped last year before completion. Instead, Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee has been tasked with the investigation – sparking fears of a whitewash. Labour MP Paul Flynn, a member of the home affairs select committee, said: ‘It’s essential that we have a full judge-led inquiry independent of political input. There are serious questions to be answered by Tony Blair and David Miliband and others.’ There are huge questions over not only what former Prime Minister Tony Blair (pictured left) personally knew about the CIA programme, but also the role played by ex-Foreign Secretary David Miliband (right) SNP MP Angus MacNeil said the CIA torture methods were ‘stomach-churning’, adding: ‘There are huge question marks for Tony Blair and his ministers.’ He said he wouldn’t trust the Intelligence and Security Committee ‘to run a bath, much less an inquiry’. Ex-Tory shadow home secretary David Davis – who has accused Britain of time and again ‘turning a blind eye’ to US torture – said a judge-led inquiry should be reinstated, as Mr Cameron originally promised. The demand is backed by a string of human rights groups, including Reprieve, Liberty and Redress. Mr Clegg said during his weekly LBC radio phone-in: ‘Once the police investigations are done, once the report from the Intelligence and Security Committee is done, we should keep an open mind, if we need to, about moving to a full judicial inquiry if there are any outstanding questions.’ A detainee from Afghanistan is carried on a stretcher after being interrogated by military officials at Guantanamo Bay in 2002 . CIA director John Brennan has refused to call the treatment of terror suspects torture. Pictured is a prisoner being escorted in Guantanamo Bay . Mr Brennan said the CIA was ‘not prepared’ to run the controversial programme and it ‘failed to live up to the standards we set ourselves’. But in a rare press conference, he refused to call the treatment of terror suspects torture and at no point said he would consider stepping down. Mr Brennan said he wanted to remind the world that after the 9/11 attacks, America’s ‘hearts were ripped open’ and that the US ‘ached, it cried in pain’. He said: ‘There were no easy answers and whatever your views are... this agency did a lot of things right.’","Newly-released report revealed CIA's gruesome interrogation techniques .

"An apartment from The Block television show was bought by one of two men involved in a $7 million insider-trading scheme to bring 'a cloak of respectability' to the shady scam. Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions Robert Bromwich, SC, told the Victorian Supreme Court the case was the worst instance of 'naked greed' insider trading in Australia's history, and that both Lukas Kamay and Christopher Hill had to receive significant jail sentences, The Age reported. Kamay, 26, a former NAB banker, and his co-offender, former Australian Bureau of Statistics worker Christopher Hill, 25, were in court following a two-day plea hearing that finished on Thursday. Sentencing has been reserved until the New Year. Kamay, of Clifton Hill, who successfully bid $2,375,000 for a Melbourne apartment from the reality TV show The Block in April, pleaded guilty to insider trading, money laundering and identity theft charges. While Hill, of Brighton, pleaded guilty to insider trading and misuse of public office charges. Lukas Kamay pleaded guilty to insider trading, money laundering and identity theft charges . Kamay, 26, and Christopher Hill, 25, met at Monash University in 2007 where they both studied commerce and economics degrees . Mr Bromwich  said Kamay went to the auction of the three-bedroom Albert Park loft, designed by twins Alisa and Lysandra Fraser on The Block, on April 8 and successfully bid almost $2.4 million for it. He said Kamay deliberately did not conceal his identity when buying the apartment because the purchase gave his crimes 'a cloak of respectability'. Mr Kamay successfully bid almost $2.4 million for Albert Park loft apartment . Kamay said it all eventually took its toll on his health and he couldn't sleep. He was 'in a hole' when he decided to buy the apartment from The Block, The Age reported. The prosecutor told the court Kamay and Hill decided to set up the scheme between May and July, 2013, with the aim of making a $200,000 profit in a year to split between them – Hill had met Kamay at Monash University in 2007 where they both studied for commerce and economics degrees. Kamay and Hill appeared in Melbourne Magistrates Court on Thursday at the end of a two-day plea hearing . Hill used his position at the ABS headquarters in Canberra to send Kamay employment, trade and retail figures before any details were released to the market, the court heard. Kamay, based at NAB in Melbourne, used the data that was passed on by Hill to make trades on currency markets based on which direction the Australian dollar was expected to go. The apartment was designed by twins Alisa and Lysandra Fraser on The Block television show . Mr Bromwich said Kamay ended up making a profit of $7.2 million but did not inform Hill about all the money that he had made in their time working together in this way. Hill pocketed a total of $19,500 in cash. He spent $10,000 and police later seized $9500, which they found in his apartment. One of the three bedrooms in the multi-million dollar home . Kamay said the culture at the NAB at the time was to make money and be successful which, in the end, consumed him. However, the prosecutor said there were no redeeming features about the two young men's offending apart from the fact that they had pleaded guilty.

"Vandals stole a bulldozer and drove it more than a mile to demolish a part of a concentration camp before setting fire to the machine to cover their tracks. Some 500 yards of the perimeter fence of the Langenstein-Zwieberge concentration camp were demolished, as well as the gate to the underground complex it links to. The ten miles of tunnels were built with slave labour at the cost of thousands of lives in an effort to hide German industry from Bomber Command. Burned out: The bulldozer was used to destroy part of Langenstein-Zwieberge concentration camp . Damage: Hundreds of yards of the site's perimeter fence were destroyed in the attack .

'But I believe both views are wrong. I don't believe there is a military solution. But that is not the only tool available to us. 'Economic sanctions on Russia are having an impact.

"Behind bars: Rodney Bruce Black, 62, of Barboursville, West Virginia was arrested after shooting two of his new neighbors Saturday . A 62-year-old West Virginia man shot dead two new neighbors without warning while they were surveying their property next door on Saturday. Rodney Bruce Black, 62, is now being charged with two counts of first degree murder for killing brothers Garrick and Carl Hopkins Jr, 60 and 61, but he says he was just protecting his own property from burglars. Black said the two men were trying to break into his tool shed around 2:30pm when he grabbed his rifle and shot them without warning from inside his house. According to pictures of Black's house on Google maps, it seems there are two sheds near his back yard, about 70 - 80 feet away. Police on the other hand, say the two men were firmly on their own property trying to get into their own tool shed, though the Black family had at one point owned that stretch of land.There was nothing belonging to Black inside the shed or worth value for that matter. They say Black only called 911 after fatally injuring both men and he didn't attempt to perform first-aid. Black was not under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time, leaving Cabell County Sheriff's struggling to find a motive in the attack. 'It's just a terrible, terrible tragedy,' Sheriff Tom McComas told the New York Daily News. 'We're still trying to figure all of this out. … Hopefully we'll find out his reasoning as the investigation continues.' While Black is white and the Hopkins brothers are black, police don't believe the attack was racially- . Fatally shot: Garrick Hopkins (left) had recently purchased the plot of land adjacent to Black and had brought his brother Carl Hopkins Jr (right) to view the property on Saturday . The weapon: Black shot the Hopkins brothers with a .243 rifle from within his home (stock image above). When he was arrested, police found even more weapons and ammunition at the house. Rodney Black, 62, was inside his home (top right) when she shot two men he believed were breaking into one of the two sheds on his property (bottom left). The sheds are 70-80 feet away from the house . Garrick Hopkins was from Milton, West Virginia and had recently bought the plot next to Black's home at 12 Lane Drive. Hopkins had taken his brother there on Saturday to show him where he planned to build a new home for his family. Both men were married and had children. When police arrived on the scene and arrested Black, they seized a large number of weapons and ammunition. Black is being held without bond at Western Regional Jail. His first preliminary hearing is set for February 4.

"When Sophie Dahl put out an appeal for £500,000 to save the her grandfather's writing hut, she had only the best intentions. But perhaps she should have realised that in tough economic times, it doesn't look too good to go asking the public for money. And the request is even stranger coming from a millionaire model, married to a millionaire singer and born into a family which earns huge royalties from Roald Dahl's classic children's books. In danger: Roald Dahl's family say the shed where he wrote his books must be moved to a museum - and the public should pay for it . Wealthy: Sophie Dahl and her successful husband Jamie Cullum could afford to pay for the restoration themselves . The campaign is now facing a . backlash from fans who think that the Dahl family should pay to move the . writer's shed from his garden to a nearby museum. One Twitter user pointed out that Ms Dahl, who found fame as a model and went on to transform herself into a TV chef, 'could earn [the money] on a single advertising modelling job'. The Dahl family wants to move the writer's hut from the garden of his home, Gipsy House in Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire, to the nearby Roald Dahl Museum for public display. The painstaking piece-by-piece move would stop the decay which has left the hut in imminent danger of collapse. However, some observers have questioned why the public fundraising campaign, launched this morning on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, is necessary given the author's continuing commercial success. Actor and writer Nicholas Pegg wrote . on Twitter: 'Top model (& Jamie Cullum's wife) Sophie Dahl wants us . to raise £0.5 million to save her bestselling grandpa's shed. Am I . missing something?' He later posted: 'A preposterously wealthy family pleading for cash for its legacy? It sounds like a lost Dahl story!' The wealth of Ms Dahl's jazz singer husband has been estimated at £5million, and she is believed to be worth a similar amount in her own right. Writing: Roald Dahl used the hut in his garden as a refuge to write his books . Journalist Matthew Sweet joined the chorus of criticism, saying: 'Have I got this wrong? The international model and TV star Sophie Dahl is asking US for money to restore a shed?' Amelia Foster, director of the Roald Dahl Museum and Story Centre, told the BBC that the Dahl family had already made 'a very significant financial contribution' to the campaign. 'We want to make sure that Roald Dahl fans in the future are able to see the hut,' she added, 'and to do that we really need to put the work and the time in now.' The legendary children's author, who . would have been 95 today, visited the hut every day for 30 years in . order to write. Only he was allowed in to the structure. But . the property has fallen into disrepair and there are fears that the . building which gave birth to classics such as Charlie And The Chocolate . Factory, Matilda, The BFG and James and the Giant Peach could fall apart . unless something is done. Backlash: Writers Janice Turner and Nicholas Pegg have both criticised Sophie Dahl's campaign via Twitter . The idea to move the shed came from the author's grandson, Luke Kelly, who was inspired by relocation of Francis Bacon's studio to the Hugh Lane gallery in Dublin. Dahl's widow Felicity - known as Liccy - said: 'It is a forensic exercise, not only to retain the eccentric objects but more importantly the magical atmosphere that fed Roald's seemingly limitless imagination.' Felicity inherited the bulk of the £2.8million the writer left in his will after his death in 1991 - worth nearly £5million in today's terms. Sophie Dahl added: 'When my grandfather died, he left in his wake an aching gap, but also a palpable magic and limitless imagination, which is not exclusive to my family. 'It is now time for us to save the hut but, even more importantly, to share it.' Memorabilia: The hut contains the items which Roald Dahl surrounded himself with to aid the creative process . The author's classic work Matilda has been adapted into a musical, opening in October - these are the four girls sharing the title role .",Musician husband Jamie Cullum's wealth alone is estimated at £5m .
"Chester, the false killer whale who was rescued off the shores of Tofino, British Columbia in Canada, has been moved to a new pool at the Vancouver Aquarium after a miraculous recovery. The large-toothed 'blackfish' - which is similar in appearance to a killer whale but is a member of the dolphin family - has been in critical care at the popular tourist attraction's Marine Mammal Rescue Centre for the past five months. The calf was initially unable to swim on its own when it was discovered by locals off North Chesterman Beach on Vancouver Island. Chester, the false killer whale who was rescued off the shores of Tofino, BC, has been moved to a new pool . False killer whales have long, slender black or dark grey bodies with a narrow head and bulbous melon. Adult males can grow up to 20ft in length, while adult females typically measure 15ft. Calves such as Chester are generally six feet in length. The first night after his rescue, staff at the aquarium were unsure whether the calf would pull through, as he was unable to swim on his own. He reportedly suffered from 'worrying dips in heart rate and respiration,' according to the CBC, and staff in wetsuits spent the night with him in the water, keeping him afloat. Today, however, head veterinarian, Dr Martin Haulena, is happy to report that Chester is doing well. The calf, who was found stranded in July, initially could not swim on his own during the first night . Since then, the oceanic dolphin has been in Dr Martin Haulena's care at the Vancouver Aquarium . ‘We have official permission from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans to move Chester to our larger research pool that is located at our facility at the Vancouver Aquarium,' said Dr Haulena in a video released by the aquarium. 'It’s just time to do that. Chester has regained a lot of strength. He’s becoming quite a great swimmer. 'He needs a bit more room. He also needs a habitat that we can control the temperature a little bit better now that it’s winter time.’ For the transport itself, several staff members got into the water with Chester to move him to the crane-assisted device. Chester has made a strong recovery in the five months that he's been at the Marine Mammal Rescue Centre . For winter, however, staff had to move the large-toothed whale to a different temperature-regulated pool . 'Sometimes [transport] can be a bit tricky, but we have a lot of great experienced staff who had done this with a lot of different animals,' Dr Haulena said. And indeed the move was successful. 'Chester did really well,' the veterinarian said. 'It was a really short transport but he did very, very well.' 'A little bit concerning just with the amount of time he was spending under water – it looked like he was a little bit nervous about the new surroundings so it took him a little while to come up for that first breath. 'But he’s kind of exploring. 'He’s not using the whole pool yet and I think this is kind of a new thing for him as well. Lots of new noises and sights to be seen, so it’s just going to take a little while for him to acclimate and get used to what’s happening.' False killer whales are similar in appearance to killer whales but are a member of the dolphin family . The move, though a bit tricky, went off without a hitch - with Chester hesitantly exploring his new home . False killer whales, which are cetaceans, historically have a very low chance of survival if they become stranded. 'It's always touch and go with young marine mammals who have become separated from their mothers and rescuing a false killer whale is a new experience for us,' Dr Haulena said. 'Very few veterinarians and other professionals around the world have experience rehabilitating stranded false killer whale calves.'","Oceanic dolphin found stranded off the shores of Tofino in July .

"A mommy blogger who has been charged with murdering her son appeared in a New York court on Thursday. Lacey Spears of Chestnut Ridge, New York was in a courtroom almost a year after her son Garnett died from acute sodium poisoning. Lacey has been accused of poisoning her son with salt, administering the fatal dose as the 5-year-old was receiving treatment in the hospital for hypernatremia - a condition that sees elevated salt levels in the blood. Scroll down for video . Appearance: Lacey Spears (above), who has been accused of poisoning her son to death, was in a Westchester, New York courtroom Thursday . Tragedy: Garnett Spears (above) died at just 5-years-old in January from acute sodium poisoning . Prosecutors revealed in court today that they would be bringing up a previous episode in which Garnett was suffering unusually high sodium levels, as well as some lies that Lacey may have told, calling her character into question. The Journal News reports, 'attorneys said Garnett Spears suffered an earlier episode of high sodium levels at Children's Hospital in Alabama, presumably at the hands of his mother, Lacey Spears.' They also intend to bring up claims that Lacey lied about being engaged to a man, who she claimed was Garnett's father, and claimed to have two other children who do not exist. The trial is set to begin on January 26. Lacey gained a national following online by writing about her son's numerous medical conditions. Not well: Lacey  is believed to suffer from Manchausen Syndrome by Proxy . Horrible end: It is thought that Lacey may have administered the fatal dose of salt to her son while he was being treated in the hospital . Garnett died on January 23, 2013  at the Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla after his sodium levels rose to an extremely dangerous level with no medical explanation. Lacey, 26, who documented her son's persistent illnesses online, has been charged with killing him by administering salt through a feeding tube in his stomach. The mother, nicknamed the 'mommy blogger', is believed to have been suffering from Postpartum Depression and Manchausen Syndrome by Proxy. The condition is a psychiatric disorder which makes a parent purposely hurt their child for attention. When Garnett was only five weeks old, Spears 'verbalized she wanted to harm him', the report said. Around a month later, she was referred to medical social services for 'interpersonal conflict, stress and dysfunction'. The document does not state what the outcome of the referral was. Barry Spear, a spokesman for the Alabama Department of Human Resources, said he had no record of hypernatremia being reported to the authorities when Garnett was a baby. Spears, who shared her son's hospital room after he was brought in suffering from vomiting and seizures, pleaded not guilty in June to charges of depraved murder and first-degree manslaughter. Depraved murder is a count often used in cases that suggest extreme recklessness rather than intentional killing. It carries the same maximum sentence, however - 25 years to life.","Lacey Spears appeared in a Westchester, New York courtroom on Thursday after being accused of killing her son Garnett .

"Regarded by many as one of the seven natural wonders of the world, tourists travel from around the globe to take in the breathtaking view from edge of the Grand Canyon. Usually they can see for miles, gazing out across the 18miles-wide valley carved out by the Colorado River 17 million years ago - but not today. A rare weather phenomenon has caused a thick sea of fog to rise from the foot of the canyon, sitting just yards from the top of the surface, creating an eerily beautiful effect. Scroll down for video . A thick blanket of fog rose from the foot of the Grand Canyon, creating an eerily beautiful effect for thousands of tourists visiting the breathtaking Arizona valley . Photographer gather to take a picture of the clouded view, caused by a unique phenomenon called a total 'temperature inversion' Hikers and photographers gathered to take in the view, which was, if anything, even more spectacular than usual. In scenes only usually seen when flying or from the top of world's tallest mountains, the Grand Canyon appears to be sitting on top of the clouds. The rare weather system, which only happens about once every several years, has been caused by recent rains in northern Arizona. Warm air at the top of the canyon stops the colder air at the bottom of the valley from rising, stopping the two masses of air from mixing. As the chillier air cools, dew caused by earlier the rain, which has now turned into fog, rises to the rim of the canyon, where the warmer air stops it from escaping. This is known as a 'total temperature inversion' and only takes place at the canyon once every several years. In scenes usually seen when flying or from the top of world's tallest mountains, the Grand Canyon appears to be sitting on top of the clouds . A couple watch a sunset at the Grand Canyon, where the spectacular view was today blocked by a thick layer of cloud cause by a rare weather system . Despite the event only taking place around once a decade, tourists were treated to a similarly mesmerising sight at the Grand Canyon last year. The thick clouds are expected to linger in the canyon today, eventually clearing over the weekend as warmer weather returns, according to the National Weather Service. When the fog gathered this time last year, Grand Canyon park ranger Erin Whittaker told MailOnline that some of the tourists visiting the canyon were disappointed they couldn't see the Colorado River below, and just figured it was a normal weather pattern. But she and the other rangers tried to explain just how lucky they were to see the cloud-covered canyon, as locals turned out photograph the stunning view. 'Word spread like wildfire and . most ran to the rim to photograph it. What a fantastic treat for all!' Ranger Whittaker said. Unique temperature inversions are caused when cold and warm air weather patterns meet, with the most spectacular sights appearing when the system takes place over a valley or canyon. The cold air is sandwiched beneath the Earth's surface and the warmer air above, shortly after rain or snow leaves liquid water on the ground. This turns into dense fog, which rises as normal but is unable to escape because of the band of warm air at the top of the canyon. Eventually the temperatures equalize, however this can take days, allowing the fog to rise further. More commonly, temperature inversions take place over cities, creating clouds of smog which can shut down urban areas to protect people from health risks.

"A Government website has beaten The Shard and the 2012 Olympic Cauldron to be named the world’s best design. Gov.uk saw off nearly 100 competitors in the Design Museum’s Design of the Year 2013. The basic-looking site features links to pages such as ‘Housing and local services’, ‘Driving and transport’ and ‘Inside Government’. Surprise: A Government website has beaten The Shard and the 2012 Olympic Cauldron to be named the world's best design . It has only two small pictures – of the Cabinet Office and of a couple outside a house to promote an energy scheme. The site promised to save the public £50million by bringing together all Government departments in one place. It was described as ‘well thought out yet understated’ by the judging panel and – in a reference to fashion – ‘the Paul Smith of websites’ by museum director Deyan Sudjic. ‘Gov.uk looks elegant and subtly British thanks to a revised version of a classic typeface, designed by Margaret Calvert back in the 1960s,’ Mr Sudjic gushed. The font used on the site is Gill Sans - the same as that used on Keep Calm And Carry On merchandise. Winner: Gov.uk saw off nearly 100 competitors in the Design Museum's Design of the Year 2013, including The Shard, pictured . Winners in seven categories - architecture, digital, fashion, furniture, graphics, product and transport - were shortlisted for the award. The website, which won the digital section, was chosen over the six other category winners, which included a modernised Parisian tower block in the architecture section and the Morph folding wheel for wheelchairs in the transport section. Television presenter and member of the judging panel Griff Rhys Jones said the Gov.uk site was ‘a clear winner’. He added: ‘It’s a vote of confidence in the idea that the Government can lead the way with simple and clever design.’ Prime Minister David Cameron claimed the win was ‘another example of Britain’s world class design talent standing out on the global stage’. Gov.uk was designed by the Government Digital Service and launched in autumn 2012. It has promised to save the public £50million by bringing together all Government departments in one place. Internet users can perform basic tasks like renewing car tax or checking the balance of a student loan from the site, as well as accessing information on everything from income tax to claiming benefits. But many more complicated problems must be dealt with by phone and some services need password access. The Designs of the Year awards, now in its sixth year, aims to celebrate ‘the most original and exciting designs, prototypes and designers in the world today’. Previous overall winners have included the London 2012 Olympic torch and the ‘Hope’ poster designed by Shepard Fairey for Barack Obama’s election campaign.

"The death of Jessica Chambers has brought heartache for her family for the second time in just two years, her brother Ben having been killed in a car accident in 2012. He was 28 when he was killed on May 7 that year on Highway 35 in Panola County. The double tragedy has led to hundreds of messages of support being left on a 'Justice For Jessica' Facebook page. The death of Jessica Chambers (right) has brought heartache for the family for the second time in just two years, her brother Ben (left) having been killed in a car accident two years . The double tragedy has led to hundreds of messages of support being left on a 'Justice For Jessica' Facebook page . Tragic: Jessica Chambers, 19, was doused with a flammable liquid and burned alive on Saturday night and police say they have not yet identified a suspect in her murder . Last moments: Jessica Chambers, 19, was caught on surveillance footage just 90 minutes before she was burned alive along the side of a rural road on Saturday. She is seen walking towards the store . Dollie Meggs Premorel wrote: 'I cant even imagine what this family must be going through after losing their son and now their daughter! May God be with this family in their time of need and grief. God Speed.' And Jeanie Braden Turner said: 'Although I did not have the honor of knowing this family or their children, my heart is breaking as I read this story. Please dear Lord, have love and mercy on this family and help them to lean on you through this grief and tragedy.' A 31-year-old man has been questioned by police over the horrific death of teenager Jessica, as police continue to analyse surveillance footage showing her 90 minutes before she was burned alive. Derrick Turner said he was quizzed on Monday at the Panola County jail, but denied that he had anything to do with the Mississippi murder. Turner said that he had no idea why he was brought in by the authorities. He told Wmcactionnews5.com: 'I was just called in for a situation I didn't know nothing about. They was just asking me did I know her or was I sleeping with her, you know. Like I said, I didn't know her like that.' He added: 'She was a sweet girl so that's why I'm messed up about it, whatever happened to her, I hate it happened you know.' Police are investigating footage that shows Chambers walking across a gas station forecourt in Courtland before waving at someone off camera and going to speak to them. She then walks into the store and pays before returning to her car. A man can be seen filling up a gasoline can beside her vehicle, but police say he has been cleared in the investigation. The footage released by police shows Jessica just before 6.30pm on Saturday. About 90 minutes later, a motorist called 911 to report a burning car a mile away and first responders arrived to find the young woman covered in flames. She fell to the ground and whispered something to one of the fire officers. Investigators have not revealed what she said but indicated that they may help find her killer, WMC reported. Seen: A person off camera caught her attention and after waving, she walked over to say hello . Caught on camera: Jessica (seen left) then went into the shop and paid while three men chatted nearby . 'She was able to communicate. It was difficult,' said Jay Hale, an assistant district attorney who prosecutes cases in Panola County. Convenience store manager Ali Fadhel said Chambers came in frequently and he would often speak with her. He told The Associated Press that Chambers spoke with someone before entering the store to purchase gas. On her way out, Chambers got a call on her cellphone, Fadhel said. After she pumped gas, she re-entered the store, bought cigarettes, and drove away, heading south on Highway 51, he said. According to Fadhel, Chambers was wearing a dark-colored sweater and pajama pants that looked like sweatpants. Chambers said she was going to make a stop before going home, Fadhel said. 'If she knew she had a problem with somebody, she would have told me,' Fadhel said. Chambers bought $14 worth of gas, more than the $5 or so she usually purchased, he said. 'I asked her, 'Why are you putting so much gas?' She said, 'I'm going somewhere,'' Fadhel said. Hale said he could not comment on Fadhel's statements. 'We've talked to a lot of people and some of those people could end up being a suspect,' District Attorney John Champion told USA Today on Wednesday. 'But as of right now we have not questioned anybody who we believe to be a suspect.' He added: 'I feel like it's something we're going to solve. It could be in the next five minutes, five months or five years. You just don't know.' Peter Odom, an attorney who prosecuted some arson cases, told HLN's 'Nancy Grace' that investigators will be assessing the physical appearance of suspects. 'They're looking for someone with singed eyebrows and maybe burned hands. Because the burner often gets burned,' he said. Police have not disclosed what Chambers said or tried to say, but her father, Ben Chambers, told the channel she told them who was responsible for the horrifying crime. 'She told them, she told them, told him who done it,' he said. Questions: While she was inside, a man (seen top right) filled up a gas can close to her car (the dark vehicle in the center) but he has been cleared. After going inside the shop, she drove off . Terrifying: She had told her mother she was going out to get food when she and her car were set alight . When responders arrived on the scene, she was walking along Herron Road, near Highway 51, and covered in flames, and was flown to Region One Health in Memphis but later died. Authorities said initial autopsy results reveal the girl died from severe burns that covered 98 per cent of her body. 'I mean it's bad,' DA John Champion told Fox. 'I have been doing this for 21 years and as far as the means of death it is certainly the worst I have dealt with.' Panola County Sheriff Dennis Darby said she had been doused with a flammable liquid and set on fire. Her father also said she had 'a big gash on her head'. 'They squirted lighter fluid down her throat and in her nose, and apparently they knocked her out,' added Mr Chambers, a maintenance worker for the sheriff's department. 'When the fire department got there, she was walking down the road on fire ... only part of her body that wasn't burned was the bottom of her feet.' As well as the surveillance footage, detectives have been examining the girl's cellphone, which was found at the scene. Her car was also at the scene but was left completely charred by the inferno. Authorities are also looking into reports that she went to a party before her death, Chambers said. Friends said that the family can't think of anyone that might have wanted to hurt Jessica, who didn't have a boyfriend and was not known to have been seeing anyone. They added that she had just started a new job at Goody's Department Store, which she loved. Scene: Her car was found along this dirt bank and she was found walking along the road in flames . Heartbroken: Her mother, Lisa Chambers, sobbed as she pleaded with the public for information . Ripped apart: Her father Ben, right, said someone poured lighting fluid down his daughter's throat and nose before setting her alight. He has also appealed for any information in her death . Lisa Chambers, the girl's mother, begged with anyone to come forward with any information they may have about the heinous crime. 'They have ripped everything I have,' she told Fox. 'She left to go clean out her car and was going to get [herself] something to eat.' She told WMC that she has barely been able to sleep following the tragedy, as the thought of the gruesome death her daughter suffered has been overwhelming. She said: 'Last night's the first night I've slept all night. I had a lady call and pray with me, and my dog started barking at the couch beside me, and it was a strange feeling, and I knew it was Jessica.' She added: 'She's not going to be at rest until her killer is caught.' Chambers' grandmother, Dot Boatright, said the family was doing as well as can be expected. Boatright said she 'went all to pieces' when she heard about Chambers' death. Not much was immediately revealed about the woman's background by authorities, but Boatright said of her granddaughter, 'She was just a sweet little girl.' Amanda Prince, who identified herself as Jessica Chambers' older sister, told CNN Wednesday night that the family is 'shocked, lost ... confused, angry, hurt.' 'I have so many questions,' she said. 'I want to know why.' Asked if she knew of anyone who had a grudge against her sister or might want to hurt her, Prince replied, 'No one. She was loved by everybody. I don't know who would want to do this or why.' Prince described her sister as 'very athletic' and outgoing, and said that at various times she had expressed interest in becoming a nurse, a dentist and a writer. 'She was happy all the time,' she said. 'She made everyone laugh. She lit up a room. ... She was just full of life.' The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation is assisting Panola authorities because of her father's connection to the police department. No arrests have yet been made. Mississippi authorities say they have received offers to help from several agencies, including the U.S. attorney's office and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Autopsy results have not been released, and it was not clear when they would be available. Anyone with information on the murder should contact the Sheriff's Office at 662-563-6230. A candle-lit vigil will be held for Jessica on Saturday. See below for video .","Jessica Chambers, 19, was burned alive on a rural Mississippi road .

"Between 800 and 200BC, a new type of revolutionary thinking appeared in Persia, India, China and the Occident. In what is described as the 'Axial Age', civilisation started to become more spiritual, creating what some historians believe are the roots of today's major religions. But instead of misfortune or poverty, researchers in Paris claim to have evidence to link the emergence of world religions with rising standards of living. Instead of misfortune or poverty, researchers claim to have evidence that links the emergence of world religions with rising living standards. They found that affluence caused a sharp transition toward moralising religions when individuals were provided with more food. Pictured is a stained glass window in Prague . Nicolas Baumard, of the Ecole Normale Superieure said: 'One implication is that world religions and secular spiritualities probably share more than we think. 'Beyond very different doctrines, they probably all tap into the same reward systems in the human brain.' The finding goes against recent reports in the Gallup World Poll that aimed to find out where people find meaning, and how they found it. It discovered that some of the world's poorest countries, such as Sierra Leone, Togo, Laos, and Senegal, ranked highest for meaning. In the new study, published in the journal Current Biology, the researchers tested various theories to explain the history in a different way, by combining statistical modelling with psychological theories. Between 800 and 200 BC, a new type of revolutionary thinking appeared in Persia, India, China and the Occident. In what is described as the 'Axial Age', civilisation started to become more spiritual. Study shows that as people felt more secure, they became more religious. Pictured is a relief at the ruins of Persepolis, Iran . They found that affluence - which they refer to as 'energy capture' - best explains what is known of the religious history, rather than political complexity, or population size. Their energy capture model shows a sharp transition toward moralising religions when individuals were provided with significantly more food. 'Humans living in tribal societies or even archaic empires often experience famine and diseases, and they live in very rudimentary houses. 'By contrast, the high increase in population and urbanisation rate in the Axial Age suggests that, for certain people, things started to get much better.' The researchers said that this transition is consistent with a shift from 'fast' life strategies - focused on the immediate problems of the day - to those focused on long-term investments. They added that it will now be interesting to test whether other familiar characteristics of modern human society - such as high parental investment and long-term monogamy - might stem from the same historical change. A recent study has found 'no significant difference' in the number or quality of moral and immoral deeds made by religious and non-religious participants. The researchers found only one difference - religious people responded with more pride and gratitude for their moral deeds, and more guilt, embarrassment and disgust for immoral ones. Researchers say the find means religious and non-religious people have more in common than generally thought when it comes to moral experiences in everyday life. 'To our knowledge, it's the first study that directly assesses how morality plays out in people's everyday lived experience,' says Linda Skitka, a University of Illinois at Chicago psychologist. who co-authored the study, which was published in the journal Science. To learn how people experience morality and immorality in everyday life, the researchers surveyed more than 1,200 adults, aged 18 to 68, via smartphone. For three days, the demographically diverse group of U.S. and Canadian citizens received five signals daily, prompting them to deliver short answers to a questionnaire about any moral or immoral act they had committed, received, witnessed or heard about within the last hour. The study found that religious and nonreligious people differed in only one way: how moral and immoral deeds made them feel.","Study carried out by researchers at the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris .

"Javier Hernandez could be in line for his first start for Real Madrid on Tuesday night against Elche having made an instant impact in the Spanish capital after his move from Manchester United. It did not go unnoticed in Spain at the weekend that as Real managed to score eight goals against Deportivo La Coruna, Karim Benzema failed to register. ‘Chicharito’ climbed off the bench to score two of the goal of the season contenders late in the second half and now Carlo Ancelotti is under pressure to pick the Mexican. Ancelotti defended Benzema after the game, saying that he looked at more than the names of the goalscorers. Javier Hernandez scored twice against Deportivo La Coruna at the weekend and could start on Tuesday . Hernandez trains alongside Isco and Marcelo Vieira ahead of the game with Elche on Tuesday . Hernandez has become an instant hero at Real Madrid after scoring twice against Deportivo . ‘He played well in Riazor even though he didn't score; I look at things beyond that,’ he said. But he is expected to leave Benzema out of his staring line-up as Real look to get their second win in the space of four days. It may still be that young attacking midfielder Isco is the man who benefits from Benzema being rested and that Hernandez has to content himself with another place on the bench but whatever happens his two goals have immediately earned him a place in the affections of Real Madrid supporters – especially those who jeered and whistled the France striker at every turn in the club’s last home game in the Champions League against Basle. In truth, Hernandez’s spectacular showing against Deportivo owed much to the way the game had gone with weak opposition long since having thrown in the towel when he made his entrance. Hernandez scored two stunning goals against Deportivo and has impressed since his arrival in Madrid . Hernandez celebrates his goal with team-mates James Rodriguez and Cristiano Ronaldo . Hernandez came on in place of Karim Benzema . He will find far more space late in games in La Liga – especially against team who have already accepted heavy defeat against Real before he makes his entrance. Strikers never like to be taken off at the end of games because they know there are rich pickings as the clock ticks down and the gaps in tired defences begin to appear. After years of struggling to find space in the Premier League that will come as a welcomed change. And ‘welcome change’ is the way many Madrid supporters see the ‘Little Pea’s’ arrival at the Bernabeu. The theory put forward last summer by Benzema’s defenders in the Spanish capital was that he would respond badly to competition and so a replacement for Gonzalo Higuain was never bought. But his credit has run dry since then and the competition is now up and running. Hernandez has gone from contesting a place in the starting line-up with Radamel Falcao, Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie at United to trying to oust Benzema at the Bernabeu. Saturday's spectacular double has given him the perfect launch pad for a far more prosperous career in Spain than he enjoyed at Old Trafford.

"A hacker turned FBI informant has warned that the US government is failing to protect Americans from cyber attacks which could shut down airports, phone systems, and water supplies. Hector Monsegur, one of the founding members of LulzSec - an offshoot of notorious hacking group Anonymous - claims the nation relies on rogue security contractors like Edward Snowden to thwart external threats. With no body monitoring the FBI-employed hackers, he says, national security is fragile and easily destructible. Warning: Hector Montsegur, a former hacker who caused $50 million damages, warns the current security system is flawed and fragile, insisting that the US is doing little to protect citizens from potential cyber attacks . 'In all reality there is no security,' Monsegur told CBS's Charlie Rose, in his first interview after avoiding jail thanks to allegedly preventing 300 attacks and securing seven arrests. The 31-year-old's own hacks that led to his arrest caused up to $50 million damages, including one sting on an FBI-affiliated firm. 'Hackers could break right into the airport, the phone systems, obviously, the water supply systems - shut them down,' he said. 'It should be an inspiration to the American government to focus on our infrastructure. 'We have a sickening reliance on security contractors, the companies that Edward Snowden worked for. 'Who will guard the guards, Charlie? Our security, the people we pay for - the people we hire with tax dollars - are not really secure themselves.' Montsegur became an FBI informant after the bureau threatened him with 26 years in prison and potential harm to his two children. Under the code name Sabu, Montsegur had already inflicted around 250 attacks, including one of the Tunisian government's internal system at the height of the Arab Spring. Back story: Montsegur was a prominent hacker before he was caught by the FBI and became an informant . Secrets: He was enlisted to relay his conversations with fellow hackers to the bureau for investigations . 'It was amazing,' Montsegur said of his life as a 'hacktivist'. 'I saw finally I was able to do something that contributed to society regardless if I was at home in the Lower East Side, in the projects, behind a computer.' Eventually, he was hooked. 'After you're hacking for so long you reach a point of no return,' he said. 'Regardless if you fear that they're gonna get you one day, it's too late.' But he shocked the hacking community when he turned against them following an offer from the FBI. It is a move that was praised by a judge as extraordinarily helpful. 'That personal characteristic of turning on a dime and doing good and not evil is the most important factor in this sentence,' said US District Judge Loretta Preska at his sentencing in May. Preska imposed a term of seven months behind bars — equal to what he'd already served — which means Monsegur was a free man after his sentencing hearing in Manhattan federal court. In his CBS interview, Montsegur explains how he didn't think twice about the bureau's offer when an agent threatened his children. Walked free: The 31-year-old was praised for his 'extraordinary' work with the FBI and spared jail in May .

"Tanning salons are offering discounted solarium deals before a ban on the controversial machines kicks in on New Year's Day, triggering health concerns. Beauty salon Skin Essentials in Elwood of Melbourne is among those promoting $1.50-a-minute specials before the ban on commercial solariums come into force from January 1 across the country. It comes after the government announced a three year introduction period for the ban allowing the solaria industry time to transition their business to safer alternatives. With the government cracking down on sunbeds in an effort to reduce skin cancer rates,  businesses who operate under the new laws will face heavy fines. Commercial solariums will be banned in all states except Western Australia in a bid to reduce skin cancer . Chair of public health of Cancer Council Australia Craig Sinclair said any businesses operating after the New Year will face heavy fines . Chair of public health of Cancer Council Australia Craig Sinclair said businesses operating solariums after the New Year will be operating illegally in Australia and will subject to significant fines by state authorities. ‘These operators are using their last breath of legitimacy but any efforts to bring in more customers is not a good thing especially when they know they can't operate when the ban takes effect in two weeks time,’ Sinclair told Daily Mail Australia. ‘With the evidence found in recent studies, there is a strong link between melanoma and sunbed use. Research shows that one in every six people who use a solarium has a greater risk of melanoma than those who do not use it. ‘We're dealing with an operation that is clearly designed for cosmetic use – clearly balancing lies verses desire for cosmetic so it's sensible for the government to make the right decision.' It has been estimated that each year in Australia, 281 melanoma cases, 43 melanoma related deaths and 2,572 squamous cell carcinomas are attributable to solarium use. ‘There is a strong link between sunbeds and melanoma deaths reported and the sooner solariums cease to operate, the more lives will be saved,’ Sinclair said. ‘Ultimately, not only are people putting their skin at risk but they’re putting their own lives at risk who continue to use sunbeds. ‘There is no such thing as a safe tan from using UV sources but there are much safer alternative options people do such as spray on tans, which beauty services have already offer.’ It has been estimated that each year in Australia, 43 melanoma related deaths  are attributable to solarium use . Until the ban becomes effective , all commercial solaria businesses  will continue to operate sunbeds . Skin Essentials co-owner Amie Mita told Daily Mail Australia that the government’s ban on solariums should’ve been dealt differently. ‘I think it’s an odd thing to take away people’s choice but I’m not going to agree or disagree with the ban but it could’ve been done a different way,’ she said. ‘Educate people on UV light and encourage them to speak to their doctors and do mandatory skin checks every year – this is something we’ve been highly promoting to our clients. ‘We have well-trained staff here who tell our clients “how much is too much” and we make sure they wear enough sunscreen if they’re going to be outdoors. ‘We know too much UV is not good and our sessions usually run between four minutes to a maximum of 16 and we always top it up with spray tan when our clients request to be darker. Skin Essentials is currently running specials - alerting clients through text message about the 'end of era' deals - charging $14 for eight minutes, and an extra $1.50-a-minute after that. ‘The special is a little novelty that we offer every now and then but we wanted to see our clients and let them know we’re still here and will continue our other beauty services when the solarium ban is lifted.’ Until the ban becomes effective on 31 December 2014, all commercial solaria businesses in NSW, Victoria, Queensland and South Australia will continue to be subject to existing Regulation introduced in 2009. Western Australia and Tasmania are yet to announce a ban.","Commercial solariums will be banned in all states except WA and Tasmania .

"It's not called the silly season for nothing. One bright spark in Townsville has risked electrocution by disconnecting a street light outside his house to add that extra twinkle to his Christmas light display. Ergon Energy spokesman Mark Timmerman says maintenance crews were stunned by the man's determination to make his house super sparkly. A man has risked being electrocuted to death to make his Christmas lights shine brighter by cutting off power to a street light outside his home in Townsville, north-eastern coast of Queensland. Pictured is a house from Christmas comedy film National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation . The recent incident draws similarities to the comedy film, starring Chevy Chase (pictured) as Clark Griswold - the father who shows the dangers of Christmas decorating . 'Don't do it. It's stupid and it's dangerous,'  Mr Timmerman told ABC radio said. 'Of his own volition he's gone and disconnected the street light in the front of his home in an attempt to make his Christmas lights display stand out a little better in the dark.' 'We're not entirely sure how he achieved that. Suffice to say it's obviously illegal ... and it's a very dangerous thing to do.' Mr Timmerman said crews had also found other examples of people tampering with street lights in the Townsville area, north-eastern coast of Queensland. Chase's character goes to extraordinary lengths to cover the exterior of his entire house in thousands of twinkle light . He said school-aged children had been seen hanging around light poles that were later found to have been tampered with. He said crews had found three poles where the inspection plates had been removed, and in one case live wires had been left exposed. 'Why children would want to be trying to access wiring in street lights we don't know, but we've reported that to police,' Mr Timmerman said.

"A tormented 15-year-old told his mother that he'd had enough of being bullied, just before he died of a fatal overdose, an inquest has heard. Simon Brooks, from Tonyrefail, South Wales, died in hospital four days after taking a drugs overdose as a 'cry for help' following a row with his best friend over a girl. Before taking the pills in March this year, the teenager had written a heartbreaking note which blamed bullies for making his life a misery. Simon Brooks, 15, (pictured left and right) died in hospital four days after taking a drugs overdose following a row with his best friend over a girl . After taking the overdose, he told his mother Julie (with whom he is pictured): 'I've had enough of being bullied and pushed around' At an inquest into his death, the court heard how Simon later told his mother Julie: 'I have had enough of being bullied and pushed around' as he lay in his hospital bed. Simon then died from multi-organ failure at University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff. Mrs Brooks, 49, a mother of five, told the inquest: 'He told me that he wished he had not done it and that it was stupid of him. 'He just looked so sorrowful and told me he was sorry.' Simon had been taken to hospital in March this year after being found shaking in his bedroom at home. In a witness statement given to South Wales Police following the death, Mrs Brooks told officers that she had returned to the family home near Pontypridd to find emergency services at the house. She said her son, a pupil at Y Pant Comprehensive School in Talbot Green, was surrounded by empty packets of medication. 'To him, heaven was a better place,' she said. 'He knew he would be out of pain and suffering of life. To him, that was a better place to be than here.' Mother-of-five Mrs Brooks, 49, told the inquest that her son had told her how he wished he had not done it and that it was 'stupid of him' But she told the hearing that Simon was not 'a suicidal misery, he was a lovely boy who loved life'. She said: 'He was not depressed and he was not miserable - he was resilient and brave. Rather than killing himself, it was more about getting out of this life.' Simon's family's solicitor, Mari Rosser, described the overdose as a 'spur of the moment reaction' which was 'a cry for help'. Close friend Emily Wintle also described how Simon had had a row with one of his friends on the day that he took the drugs. He had texted Emily saying: 'I am going to take an overdose - bye.' The family's solicitor described Simon's overdose as a 'cry for help' When she tried to contact him again, he said: 'Too late' and hung up. He later told Emily on the phone: 'Emily do you know I am a Christian - I want to go and be with God.' The inquest also heard from PC Nicholas Hughes, who went to Simon's house. He told the inquest how Simon and his best friend 'had fallen out over a girl'. Paramedic David Blacker, who took the schoolboy to hospital, said: 'He said he had been bullied that day and they had tried to force him to fight someone. 'He wanted to die because he had enough of being bullied.' Valleys Deputy Coroner Graeme Hughes said Simon's intention is taking the overdose was 'unclear'. He said: 'The standard of proof should be that it is beyond reasonable doubt. 'I believe there is doubt as his mother gave evidence to indicate he regretted his actions which was corroborated by an entry in his hospital notes.' He recorded a conclusion that he 'died from deliberate self harm in the setting of unclear intention'. After the hearing in Aberdare, South Wales, Mrs Brooks said: 'I am convinced he did not mean to kill himself and I am delighted at the verdict.' Mrs Brooks is planning to continue her campaigns against bullying. Ms Rosser added: 'There were a number of questions that were asked today that were not responded to. Those are things that we are going to need to take further.' At the time of his death, Mrs Brooks told how Simon had been bullied at his current school and at his previous school in Treorchy, South Wales, where he was allegedly assaulted on a train on the way to school. But she said Simon did not want to press charges or complain to the school authorities, because he felt it would only make things worse. She said: 'He was being pushed about, having his bag grabbed and subjected to verbal abuse. 'He loved the lessons and had a lovely group of friends, but he wasn't being left alone at break times and lunchtimes. 'Every Sunday night he would beg me not to send him to school. During the school holidays he would count the days and hours until he had to go back. 'He was so brave he used to go every day and try to stick up for himself.'

"A pensioner was told she could not send her Christmas cards at a Post Office – because they were too small. Staff refused to accept 79-year-old Yvonne Veakins' charity cards, which measure 3½in x 3½in and 3½in x 5in, claiming they might get lost in the mail system.

And now the cheekily named Savour Everything In Moderation, the equivalent of eight wine bottles, has arrived in London. There are only six bottles of the rare Windsor-based specialist beer-makers Savour Beer in the world - and one is on sale at Sourced Market in St Pancras, London. The six-litre bottle of sparkling beer was developed by Windsor brewers Savour Beer. There are only six bottles of the beer in the world and one of them has arrived at Sourced Market in St Pancras, London . The giant bottle was developed to raise the profile of the Champagne-style beer, which is brewed using 100 per cent floor malted British barley, hops and three yeast strains. 'I wanted to raise people's expectations and perceptions of beer; how it is packaged and how it can be consumed,' Sandy Kirkpatrick, Founder of Savour Beer told MailOnline Food.

The women are put through their paces in the searing heat of the desert to combat the Taliban in Pakistan . Their training also comes in the wake of signs of greater co-operation between Pakistan, Afghanistan and the US in the last week. For years the Pakistani military has been accused by the Afghans, the Americans and NATO of helping the NATO-US coalition in Afghanistan on the one hand, but at the same time allowing al-Qaeda and the Afghan Taliban to seek refuge and gather support in Pakistan. Moreover, many leaders of the Afghan Taliban have lived in Pakistan since 2001. The training comes in the wake of stronger relations between Pakistan, Afghanistan and the US .

Their training comes at a time when relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan are improving . But this week, for the first time in nearly 10 years, the Pakistan army killed a high-level leader of al-Qaeda, Adnan el Shukrijuma, who had planned several failed attacks in the US and Britain. He was killed during a raid by Pakistani forces close to the Afghan border in the South Waziristan tribal agency. The next day it was reported a US drone had killed nine suspected Pakistani Taliban including a senior commander Umer Farooq. In a sign of improving relations, the US has also started to appease Pakistan. A former top Pakistani Taliban commander, arrested by US forces in Afghanistan last year, was repatriated to Pakistan. It has since handed over a further three Pakistani Taliban, including former second-in-command, Latif Mehsud. The women will take charge in police raids and perform searches on female suspects .

"Waiting for the light to turn green at a pedestrian crossing can  feel like a lifetime. Now two innovative students from Germany hope they've come up with a way to make it a more enjoyable - and even sociable - experience. Amelie Kunzler and Sandro Engel have designed StreetPong, a multi-player game of touch screen ping pong that's played wirelessly  with a person on the other side of the crossing. The ActiWait prototype is played on a touch screen and is based on a classic ping pong arcade game . Amelie Künzler from Urban Invention (right) wants to make it possible for everyone in the world to play . After the duo uploaded a video of the the game and concept, five million watched and shared it on YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. The overwhelming interest prodded them to bring StreetPong to life. Amelie and Sandro founded a company called Urban Invention to make the product and, since October, have installed a small number of prototypes - renamed ActiWait - around Germany. They have launched a crowdfunding project and, so far, €349 of the €35,000 goal has been raised . Amelie, who is currently studying  at the HAWK Hildesheim, said: 'We want to make it possible for everyone to be able to play with other people while waiting for the light to turn green.' ActiWait has a resilient touch screen and is  built into pedestrian crossings. The students are asking for crowdfunding via Indiegogo in hopes of securing money to develop the hardware and move it on from a prototype into a large scale production. They also want to push ahead with more applications and have it officially checked for safety. German students Sandro and Amelie founded a company to make the product a reality . The developers also want to use the screens for other applications, including news feeds, navigation and traffic education for children, or even speed dating. So far €349 (£275) of the pair's €35,000 (£27,600) goal has been raised and Urban Invention are attempting to attract backers by pledging to install ActiWaits were they receive the most financial support.","Students came up idea of ping pong game  at crossings two years ago .

"A four-month-old baby suffered 13 broken ribs and three skull fractures as a result of five separate incidents before her death, her inquest has heard. Evie Grace Thomas died on February 21, 2013 at the Royal Albert Edward Infirmary in Wigan. A full CT scan, reviewed by two radiologists, discovered numerous existing injuries. Her father, Martin Thomas, 30, was acquitted of assaulting the young baby at an earlier trial at Liverpool Crown Court. The inquest heard that the injuries suffered by Evie, pictured, could have happened over five occasions . Her father, Martin Thomas, pictured, had been acquitted of assaulting his daughter on an earlier occasion . Evie's mother Hayley Fisher, centre, said that she and her daughter had been 'failed by the justice system' Martin Thomas had his daughter's hand print tattooed onto his chest following her death in February 2013 . The infant suffered from Treacher Collins syndrome which affected the development of her facial bones. Medical investigations found that Evie Grace was injured in five separate incidents, with a belief that the fractures could have been caused by 'squeezing or standing or stamping on the ribs by an adult'. However, medics admitted that the string of injuries did not contribute to Evie Grace's death. The inquest in Bolton heard that Evie Grace suffered the same genetic illness as her father. She also suffered from colic which caused her pain, distress and discomfort. Dr Phillip Lumb, forensic pathologist said: 'There were many rib fractures on both sides of her chest and these were of varying ages. There was no disease process that would have made her more vulnerable to rib fractures and there was no accident explanation from the materials reviewed. 'The pattern of ribs fractures is suggestive of multiple physical assault. These look like rib fractures as a consequence of direct hard blows or hard tight gripping. Rib fractures can cause problems with breathing that are harmful and may have an influence on someone’s death.' The inquest was told six of the thirteen rib fractures may have happened in the week leading up to her death and Dr Lumb added: 'They were of three different ages and caused by the application of blunt force. The force required would be quite considerable.' October 30, 2012: Evie Grace Thomas is born . December 2012: Evie Grace admitted to hospital having suffered 'a massive lump to her head . February 21, 2013: Evie Grace Thomas dies at the Royal Albert Edward Infirmary in Wigan . November 26 2012 - February 22 2013: Martin Thomas accused of assaulting his daughter between these dates. July 20, 2014: Police claim Martin Thomas wanted to plead guilty to lesser offences, but this approach was rejected by the Crown Prosecution Service. October 29, 2014: Martin Thomas is acquitted by a jury at Liverpool Crown Court of ten charges, including grievous bodily harm, following a six-day trial. December 9, 2014: An inquest in Bolton returns an Open verdict . The inquest was told Evie had been previously admitted to hospital in December 2012 after suffering a 'massive lump' to her head while in the charge of her father. Thomas later claimed while he had been downstairs changing her nappy on a foot stool another small child fell on her and a toy telephone she was holding hit his daughter on the head. But Dr Lumb said: 'I examined the explanation in detail. It was my opinion that the incident described initially had not caused the skull fracture. I didn’t think it was plausible as a cause of the skull fracture. You need considerable impact to fracture a child’s skull.' He told the inquest Evie Grace may have died from 'non-accidental upper airway obstruction' and added: 'For example by smothering. It cannot be excluded as a cause of death. It may not leave any signs. Upper airway obstruction by smothering cannot be excluded as a potential cause of death. 'Rib fractures are a cause of pneumonia. The chest can become painful with rib fractures and it causes breathing difficulties. Rib fractures may be one of the main causes of death in this case.' Thomas from Worsley Hall, Wigan, stood trial last October at Liverpool Crown Court during which prosecutors said it was believed the skull fractures suffered by Evie Grace were 'likely to have been caused by hitting her head against a flat surface or striking her head with a blunt instrument.' But he was acquitted of five charges of causing grievous bodily harm with intent between November 26, 2012 and February 22 last year. Mr Thomas said after his trial he had undergone 'two years of hell' until he was finally acquitted by the jury . Thomas also had a tattoo on his arm, pictured, featuring his daughter's name commemorating her short life . The inquest heard that Evie, pictured, had been found unresponsive in her Moses basket on the day she died . Detective Superintendent  Peter Jackson of Greater Manchester Police said: 'We know from both Martin and Hayley at 6am on 21st of February Martin returned home after a night shift working at the Heinz factory. He came home and when he arrived Evie was upstairs and when he came in he would go and collect her and take her down stairs. From his account he said he had been playing with her for an hour.' He said Thomas told officers he put Evie in a Moses basket face down claiming he was told to lay her left cheek laying down on the mattress. But when he checked her again at 9.45am her face was fully facing into the mattress at which point she was unresponsive and the ambulance was called. She died in hospital. Miss Fisher was also arrested but released without charge. Mr Jackson added: 'The CPS reviewed the case and evidence and we received advice to charge Martin Thomas. On 20th July we were contacted by prosecution counsel stating that Martin’s defence team had accepted guilty pleas to lesser offences. Martin accepted a momentary loss of control, but this was rejected by the CPS. They said a charge on the basis of momentary loss of control did not reflect the series of assaults. 'He went to a full not guilty trial and blamed Hayley. The jury acquitted him of all the charges and the cause of death remained unascertained.' Recording an open verdict coroner Jennifer Leeming said: 'During her life Evie had sustained serious injuries and Dr Lumb detailed the force needed to inflict these injuries. 'What can be said for certain is that there is no realistic explanation for how that child in her short life sustained 13 rib fractures and three skull fractures.' Mr Thomas waited until Miss Fisher and her family left the court before departing without comment . After the hearing Thomas waited until Miss Fisher and her family left the court before departing without comment. In an interview with his local newspaper after his acquittal he said: 'It’s all such a big relief. All I ever wanted to do, and set out to do, was prove my innocence and now I have done that. 'I’ve been beaten up on the street and called names and for the last 20 months I’ve been stuck in the house. I had to leave my job and I’ve been suicidal, I tried taking my own life. You just wouldn’t believe how much of a weight off my shoulders it actually is. No-one can ever imagine or come close to imagining how I’ve felt unless they go through it themselves. 'I can now finally walk around the streets without looking over my shoulder and I can actually grieve properly for my daughter without any stress on my back. I was scared of people thinking I had done something. Now I don’t have to worry about that.' Mr Thomas denied he ever offered to accept a plea in connection with his earlier assault case. Miss Fisher said following the hearing: 'I feel I have been failed by the justice system - I just kept hoping that we would get some answers and we will get justice one day.'","Evie Grace Thomas died on February 21 after being rushed to hospital .

"A teenaged robber is dead after a Washington, DC stickup went wrong and left him the victim of a sawed-off shotgun blast. Channel Johnson, 18, approached a man on a Southeast street on Wednesday and announced it was a robbery, say police. However, his 22-year-old target managed to wrest the gun away from Johnson and apparently fired. Robbery gone wrong: A teenager in Washington, DC was killed after trying to rob a man with a sawed-off shotgun (pictured) Robbery: Channel Johnson, 18, announced to a 22-year-old man on a Southeast DC street just before 11am Wednesday that he intended to rob him . The encounter occurred before 11am. Johnson was found shot in the back. The teen was rushed to the hospital in what authorities told the Washington Post was grave condition. According to MyFoxDC, the 22-year-old remained at the scene and cooperated with police. The teen later died from his injuries. Police were not expected to file charges. Turned the gun on robber: A struggle ensued and left Johnson with a serious gunshot wound to the back after his weapon was wrested away from him . Police say the 22-year-old man stayed at the scene and cooperated. It is being investigated as a death and not, apparently, a crime of any kind . The incident was one of four shootings reported in the nation's capital on Wednesday alone. Another was part of what police are investigating as an aggravated assault but were unsure, according to WUSA, whether someone was actually hit by a bullet. A third potentially related incident occurred just outside the Anacostia Metro stop. A victim was breathing and conscious when paramedics took him away. Police are searching for three black men, one of whom may have worn a mask, in the second two shootings. A fourth shooting appeared to be unrelated and involved a man at Alabama Avenue and 22nd who was also taken to the hospital alive.","Police say Channel Johnson, 18, was shot after he approached a 22-year-old target on a Washington, DC street on Wednesday .

"A man brutally murdered his ex-girlfriend just weeks after he was reunited with her via Facebook after 15 years apart. David Hoyle, 39, attacked Rebecca Bamber, 42, with three broken wine bottles before stabbing her repeatedly at her home in Widnes, Cheshire, as she tried to escape. As Ms Bamber collapsed in her garden, Hoyle fled and was eventually stopped by police on the M56 motorway. Jailed: David Hoyle, 39, brutally murdered his ex-girlfriend Rebecca Bamber, 42, just weeks after he was reunited with her via Facebook after 15 years apart . Today he was jailed for life at Chester Crown Court and ordered to serve a minimum of 25 years behind bars after a jury convicted him of murdering the mother-of-one. Hoyle, from Bradford, West Yorkshire had previously been in a relationship with Ms Bamber, but had lost touch with her until the pair began chatting on the social network in May. They had met on a number of occasions in both Bradford and Cheshire but the night before mother-of-one Ms Bamber died is believed to have been the first time that Hoyle had visited her home. Hoyle stayed the night on June 7 but the following morning a neighbour was in his garden when he heard a woman screaming and the sound of a broken glass. The neighbour then saw Ms Bamber at the downstairs front window of her home, covered in blood and mouthing the words 'phone the police'. Hoyle had attacked her with three wine bottles in a bedroom causing wounds so severe that they fractured her skull. He went on to repeatedly stab her as she made a desperate attempt to escape and she eventually made it into her garden, still pursued by Hoyle, where she collapsed. Hoyle fled the scene in a van and rammed a number of police vehicles before he was stopped and arrested on the M56 motorway. Sentenced: Hoyle was jailed for life at Chester Crown Court (pictured) and ordered to serve a minimum of 25 years behind bars after a jury convicted him of murdering the mother-of-one . Police were able to track him after Ms Bamber’s neighbour noted the registration number and details of the van. Ms Bamber died at Whiston Hospital from her injuries. Following sentence, Detective Inspector Helen Spooner, of Cheshire Constabulary, said: 'Hoyle’s attack was brutal, sustained and shocking - the level of violence used was extreme and the injuries sustained by Rebecca were devastating. She had clearly tried to desperately fight off her attacker but was overpowered by him. 'We will probably never know the real reason behind Hoyle’s actions that day. Only he knows why he subjected Rebecca to such a brutal attack in her own home. 'Hoyle has shown no remorse for what he did five months ago and I can only hope that his time behind bars will allow him to reflect upon what he has done and the consequences of that, both to Rebecca and all those who loved her and knew her. 'My thoughts remain with Rebecca’s family and friends who have been deeply affected by what happened that day. I hope that the successful conclusion of this case will allow them to find some sort of closure although I know they are still trying to come to terms with what has happened. She added: 'This was a particularly difficult case for all involved and I would like to thank every single person who assisted with the investigation. In particular I would like to thank Rebecca’s neighbour who came to her aid that day and did all he could to help her b‘ and ensure Hoyle was caught. 'His actions were truly remarkable and I cannot thank him enough. I know that what happened that day has affected him deeply and I only hope that the conclusion of this case allows him to move forward with his life.' In a statement, Ms Bamber’s family said: 'Even after the lengthy period of time, we still find it difficult to believe that Rebecca has been taken from us in such a cruel and violent way. Not only has a mother been taken, but a sister and daughter too. It is difficult for us all to come to terms with what actually happened but, as a family, we hope that the conclusion of this court case will allow us some closure as we try to rebuild our lives and move forward.' Richard Riley, Senior Crown Prosecutor with Mersey-Cheshire Crown Prosecution Service, said Ms Bamber had been stabbed a total of 11 times. 'Hoyle subjected Ms Bamber to a brutal and sustained attack and clearly intended to do her really serious harm,' he said. 'Hoyle’s claim that he hadn’t meant to kill her was ridiculous. She’d been stabbed 11 times with two different knives and three broken bottles. 'The jury dismissed these claims and has found Hoyle guilty of murder. 'I would like to thank Ms Bamber’s neighbour for the courage he showed throughout this dreadful incident. His 999 call was the key to putting a very dangerous man behind bars.'","David Hoyle, 39, and Rebecca Bamber, 42, had reunited via Facebook .

"A major Ebola outbreak may have gone unreported in a remote region of Sierra Leone, according to the the World Health Organization (WHO), whose officials found scores of bodies piled up in a hospital earlier this week. 'They uncovered a grim scene,' the UN health agency said in statement after making the discovery  in the remote diamond-mining region of Kono. 'In 11 days, two teams buried 87 bodies.' Among the dead were a nurse, ambulance driver and janitor who had previously been drafted in to remove bodies as they piled up, they added. Officials from the World Health Organisation fear another outbreak of the Ebola Virus in the remote Kono region of Sierra Leone. Health workers discovered scores of bodies piled up at the region's only hospital . Workers prepare disinfectants outside the house of a person suspected to have died of the Ebola virus near Freetown, Sierra Leone. Health teams recently buried 87 bodies in just 11 days in the Kono region . The Kono region has now been on lockdown by the Sierra Leone government as it bids to battle the disease. The district had reported 119 cases among its 350,000 inhabitants before December 9 but officials fear the numbers will be far worse . The area has now been put on a two-week lockdown by the country's government. 'Our team met heroic doctors and nurses at their wits end, exhausted burial teams and lab techs, all doing the best they could, but they simply ran out of resources and were overrun with gravely ill people,' said Dr. Olu Olushayo, an official in WHO's response Ebola team. Officially the Kono district had reported 119 cases among its 350,000 inhabitants before December 9, but some have expressed concern that the figures have massively underrepresented the size of the outbreak in the region. In just five days leading up to the WHO team's arrival, 25 people died in a makeshift, cordoned-off section in the area's only hospital. Bodies are a frightening source of contagion as the devastating virus carries its heaviest load right after death. WHO officials also discovered that villages scattered across eight of the area's 15 chiefdoms had also been hit by the disease. 'We are only seeing the ears of the hippo,' said Dr. Amara Jambai, Sierra Leone's Director of Disease Prevention and Control, using a local proverb equated to 'the tip of the iceberg.' Sierra Leone authorities said they ordered a two-week 'lockdown' in the region until December 23, in hope of containing transmission of the virus. While people will be able to move within the Kono region, officials said no one will be allowed to leave. The West African nation recently overtook neighbouring Liberia for the highest number of Ebola cases, recording 7,897 since the epidemic was first identified earlier this year. 'For tireless acts of courage and mercy,' Time announced Ebola fighters as their 'Person of the Year 2014' However, Liberia has registered 3,177 deaths, considerably more than the 1,768 marked in Sierra Leone, raising concerns that many fatalities have not been reflected in the figures. Quoted by WHO, the country's health minister Abu Bakarr said it was difficult to put an exact figure on the death toll, explaining that his country was only counting deaths from laboratory confirmed Ebola cases. 'They are adding suspected cases, so that is causing the discrepancies in the results. We are going by the textbook,' he said. The current Ebola epidemic is the worst on record and has killed 6,388 people out of 17,942 cases in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone according to WHO data. The death toll continues to grow, fuelled principally by new infections in Sierra Leone. News of the latest outbreak comes just days after medics battling the disease were recognized as Time magazine's Person of the Year . Announcing the prestigious title , editor Nancy Gibbs said: 'The rest of the world can sleep at night because a group of men and women are willing to stand and fight.'","New outbreak discovered in Kono by the World Health Organisation (WHO)

"A hitchhiker travelled thousands of miles around America - by catching lifts with women he met on a dating app. Daniel Beaumont, of Kendal, Cumbria, turned to Tinder in a bid to speed up his epic journey - after despairing of being overlooked for lifts on the side of the road. In total, he charmed 32 women into giving him a lift on his 7,500 mile adventure from the west coast of Canada back to New York. Scroll down for video . Audacious: Daniel Beaumont, of Kendal, Cumbria hitchhiked across America with women he found on Tinder . The 24-year-old had set off on his hitchhiking trip across the US in May this year to attend a wedding in British Columbia. But he soon became tired of being rejected by drivers as he thumbed for lifts, often in dismal conditions, and the first leg from east to west took him three months. He then decided to hijack Tinder, which uses GPS to match people locally, in an attempt to find his way back from Vancouver. Mr Beaumont admitted there was 'some romance' during the journey that followed - but declined to expand further.

He told MailOnline: 'Tinder has this reputation as a pick-up site, but I was trying to use it in an alternative way. 'I made my choices of possible match quite broad. I wasn’t necessarily looking for dates so I had opted for quite a broad age range, looking for women aged between 18 and 50 who were located within five miles of me.'

"A theatre has been forced to apologise after sending more than 100 'disgusting' porn DVDs to children as young as 10 after a duplication blunder. Families were expecting to receive recordings of summer school performances from the Edinburgh Playhouse, but a collection of hardcore movies called The Bondage Mistress were sent instead. Theatre bosses said the 'horrifying' error was made by production company Edithouse – which has also apologised for the mistake. Edinburgh Playhouse has been forced to apologise after sending out more than 100 'disgusting' porn DVDs to children as young as 10 after a duplication blunder . A 10-year-old girl from Midlothian, who had attended a summer stage school at the Playhouse earlier this year, was reported to have been sent the DVD. Her father described the film as 'absolutely disgusting filth' and said he would be taking legal action. 'Someone has broken the law somewhere here, to send that sort of thing out to a child,' he told the Edinburgh Evening News. 'This is sexual exploitation-type stuff. I'm going to have to phone my solicitor. It's absolutely ridiculous. 'We haven't watched right through it, but it's not just amateur porn – this is the proper thing. It's unbelievable.

"Joan Fontaine's Oscar was withdrawn from a charity auction after the Academy threatened to sue because if wasn't first offered to them for $1, representatives of the actress's estate have said. The award was expected to . fetch between $200,000 to $300,000 at Christie's auction house in New York, with proceeds earmarked for the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Monterey County in California. This was in line . with Fontaine's wishes. The actress died aged 96 last year. Actress Joan Fontaine, who won an Oscar for her role in Hitchcock's Suspicion, wanted the proceeds of the sale to go to an animal charity after her death last year . But the estate says it withdrew Fontaine's Oscar from a . much-anticipated auction when the Academy of Motion Picture Arts . and Sciences threatened to sue over its sale. Oscars rarely come up for auction because, since 1950, the . Academy has required winners, their heirs or estates not . sell an Oscar without first offering it to the Academy for just $1. Fontaine won the Academy Award for Best Actress in 1941 for her . role in Alfred Hitchcock's thriller Suspicion, starring alongside Cary . Grant. At the time was the youngest-ever Best Actress winner and the only actor to win an Oscar for a Hitchcock film. The actress is is seen here looking at her 1941 Oscar for her role as the timid wife in Hitchcock's Suspicion . 'The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences was unmoved . in the pleadings of all involved, and announced they would file . suit if the sale continued,' representatives for the estate said . in a statement. It noted that Fontaine's Oscar was awarded . well before the now-required legal agreement regarding sales. 'We feel that to fight this promised legal suit against the . estate (and SPCA), everyone except the lawyers would lose,' the . statement added.

"Manchester City's desire to land Radamel Falcao was handed a timely boost after Alvaro Negredo agreed to join Valencia on Sunday night. The Premier League champions have been offered the Monaco forward and want to add him to their midst before the transfer window shuts on Monday, with Arsenal also keen but unlikely to win the race. A meeting at Manchester City is underway, expected to ratify the transfer which is £25million plus add-ons of £2m - and City believe that is good business. VIDEO Scroll down to watch City target  Falcao score an acrobatic bicycle kick in training . And he's off: Alvaro Negredo has agreed a return to Spain with Valencia on loan with a view to a permanent . Incoming? The developments mean Manchester City have the means to land Radamel Falcao . Thumbs up: Falcao has also been offered to Arsenal and Manchester United as the deadline approaches . It is unlikely they will buy a striker to replace him as they believe they have enough cover. City's pursuit was always dependent on whether they were able to recoup money for Negredo, who is set to join the La Liga side on loan with a view to a £20million move back to Spain. The clubs are yet to finalise a deal, but Negredo has agreed to the move after Valencia president, Amadeo Salvo, director of football Francisco Rufete and Peter Lim's right-hand man at the club, Kim Koh, travelled to Madrid to meet face-to-face with the player's agents. Their aim was to offer personal terms to the Spanish international and figure out how to get a deal done with Manchester City, with Negredo taking a pay cut to push through a transfer. Manuel Pellegrini watched his City side uncharacteristically struggle going forward in the defeat against Stoke over the weekend and he would not rule out a move for Falcao afterwards. Complications: Manuel Pellegrini spoke of the difficulties City have been enduring in the transfer market . Splurge: Manchester United aren't thought to be keen on Falcao after spending £60million on Angel di Maria . The manager spoke about having time to do business and added 'we will see what happens' after laying bare the problems they were finding in financing any potential deals. 'We have a restriction about the amount of money we can spend and the amount of players we can use,' Pellegrini said. Financial Fair Play provides a huge stumbling block for City - who were fined £49million by UEFA in June for breaking monetary rules - and they always had to get the injured Negredo off the wage bill in order to finance a move; they also need to free up space in the squad for another foreign import. That looked a tall order on Sunday morning, made worse by Falcao seemingly confirming he was leaving for Real Madrid on Twitter. But Carlo Ancelotti instead moved to sign Manchester United's Javier Hernandez on loan on a fast-paced day before the deadline in which Falcao appeared to be offered to a plethora of clubs across Europe. Negredo will remain at the Etihad Stadium should they fail to sort a deal out for the Colombian.

"Emerging from shoes, lying undetected in toilets, waiting patiently in cars and on walls, native wildlife has earned Australia the tag of a country brimming with deadly creatures. In many cases, this reputation is well-earned, with countless cases of bites, stings, and close encounters with the nation's creepiest of crawlies. Images of the poisonous and many-legged creatures have started to pack a frightful punch overseas, with many US citizens expressing their fear of travelling to Australia because of what they might find hidden in their shoes.

Emerging from shoes, lying undetected in toilets, waiting patiently in cars and on walls, native wildlife has earned Australia the tag of a country brimming with deadly creatures . An Australian redback spider made a home in this shoe (above), complete with a spiderweb . A thread on Reddit, entitled 'In Australia, this is why we wear shoes', has sparked a long list of tales about the many encounters posters have had with finding an unexpected surprise in their backyard. The users labelled the pictures 'horrifying', 'terrifying', 'scary' and worthy of cancelling trips to country. The terror isn't surprising, given that Australian funnel web spiders are capable of penetrating the material in shoes and finding their way into dark places with little effort. As the country inches towards January and humidity peaks, huntsmen spiders will be out in force and keeping locals on their toes. Funnel web spiders are the most venomous the many spider varieties found in Australia, with the male spider's venom almost six times more toxic than the females. Australian funnel web spiders (above) are capable of penetrating the material in shoes and finding their way into dark places with little effort . This Reddit user spotted the egg of a spider laying in wait inside his shoe, and decided to let it hatch before burning the spider, and his shoe with it . An Australian red belly black snake hiding in a the darkest place it could find- a pink shoe . Especially during the summer months as the weather gets warmer, snakes and spiders will become bolder at making a home inside shoes and other dark spots as the look for a mate. While there hasn't been a spider-related death in Australia since 1979, there is still plenty to be scared of, especially among those living in the US. While many of the posters found the native creatures hiding out amusing, one Reddit user posted, 'Funny in Australia = Horrifying everywhere else.'

Bears and cougars are too big to hide in your shoe.' Even Australians jumped on the bandwagon of fear, advising that shoes and dark places should always be checked in case there were any stowaways making an item home.

"Senior Ukip insiders are furious at the way an alleged affair between its general secretary and a high profile candidate has been played out in public. Roger Bird and Natasha Bolter have revealed intimate details of meetings, dinners and texts at the centre of claims he behaved improperly as a party official. In a series of interviews there have been claims and denials over whether the pair ever had sex, which one Ukip source warned has left them ‘both look like f***king prats’. Ukip candidate Natasha Bolter and Roger Bird have both given interviews making allegations about their relationship since he was suspended over allegations of impropriety as general secretary . In a shock announcement on Monday evening, Ukip announced Mr Bird had been suspended while it investigated allegations of 'impropriety'. On Tuesday Mrs Bolter gave an interview claiming to have been the victim of sexual harassment. Mr Bird has said the pair were in a relationship. Mrs Bolter told the BBC’s Newsnight: ‘I didn’t sleep with Roger Bird, end of.’ But he insisted: ‘For the record, yes she did.’ Senior Ukip figures are understood to be infuriated at the way both sides have chosen to ‘air their laundry in public’. A source told MailOnline: ‘It would be better if they kept it private. Both of them now look like f***ing prats.’ But friends of Mr Bird today hit back at the party hierarchy, saying Ukip itself had made the issue public by releasing a press statement about the disciplinary process. ‘It’s a bit rich for senior people in the party to be attacking Roger over this,’ said one. ‘It was Ukip who put this in the public domain with a press release. This should have been a strictly confidential process, and if it had been left to Roger it would have been. ‘But he was suddenly facing a very public allegation which he had to respond to.’ Doubts have been cast on Mrs Bolter’s account of events, particularly why she continued sending Mr Bird affectionate text messages after the date she claimed to have raised concerns about him. It also emerged she lied about studying politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford University in the 1990s. The ongoing scandal risks damaging Nigel Farage's claim to have professionalised his party . November 5: A Ukip member makes a complaint about the candidate selection process in South Basildon. Ukip contacts Natasha Bolter, who is unable to meet them for six days . November 6: Ukip launches and an internal enquiry into allegations of impropriety against general secretary Roger Bird . November 6: Mrs Bolter texts Mr Bird: ‘U r not coming back and accordingly my life will back to a meaningless void and it was chance that I met u. But I didn’t invent u – u were real’ November 6: Mrs Bolter texts Mr Bird: ‘I have sang you praises to Nigel for 12 minutes’ November 9: Mrs Bolter texts Mr Bird: ‘I am really missing you bird’ November 11: David Soutter, Ukip head of candidates, interviewed Mrs Boulter and produced a report . November 11: Mrs Bolter texts Mr Bird: ‘To cover u we can’t be together. Believe it is what u wanted, so the spin helped. Love or infatuation made me lose my brain for a while! Am v disappointed and life is not a bronte novel – although I do wish it was xx’ November 14: Internal management meeting is held which decides to bring in external HR consultants to conduct an independent investigation. A firm was contacted that day . November 29: Mr Soutter texts Mrs Bolter: ‘I can sort this if you will make a formal complaint about what has happened to you including your treatment by Roger who has caused all this to happen’ December 7: HR consultants produce a draft report. Mr Bird is suspended . December 8: Mr Bird’s suspension becomes public. Ukip says: ‘The party has acted swiftly and decisively and will not tolerate impropriety of any kind amongst its staff’ Ukip has repeatedly insisted it is trying to carry out a professional disciplinary investigation into Mr Bird’s conduct. And it stresses that the issue of whether or not the couple slept together is not central to the investigation. ‘There are still questions to answer. He is still under our complaints procedure. We are trying to ensure that our procedures are watertight,’ the source added. There are claims he ‘marked up’ Mrs Bolter after her interviewing her about her suitability to be a candidate to ensure she made it on to the approved list. The row erupted when the religious education teacher accused Mr Bird of ‘taking her down to the snooker room’ at a club after a dinner in London and propositioning her on the day he interviewed her as a prospective candidate. But he responded by revealing a string of intimate text messages he claimed she had sent him – including one which read: ‘I love you and miss you and think you are sort of perfect.’ He insisted the messages proved that, far from sexually harassing her, the pair had actually been in a ‘consensual’ relationship. But Mrs Bolter, 39, responded furiously to his claims, accusing him of lying and insisting: ‘I did not sleep with Roger Bird – end of.’ But she admitted there were text messages. In an interview with BBC Two’s Newsnight, recorded before Mr Bird releases the content of texts, she said: ‘There are texts between us.’ Asked if they were of an ‘intimate nature’ she replied: ‘No.’ She added: ‘Often I send a kiss after a text… you know like: see you later kiss kiss…I think that’s a girl thing to do. But I don’t think it is particularly intimate.’ One text message, which Mr Bird claimed was sent by Mrs Bolter on November 2, said: 'I love u bird and wish u let me look after u. Hope u feel better xx.' It has also emerged that she was still texting the party’s general secretary her 'love or infatuation' a week after an investigation was launched. Mrs Bolter claims she raised he concerns with the party on November 5. But it is understood that the investigation was triggered by another party member raising concerns about Mr Bird’s handling of the candidate selection process on that date. The party contacted Mrs Bolter was contacted on the same day, but only met David Soutter, Ukip’s head of candidates, on November 11. Labour defector Natasha Bolter quit UKIP claiming she was sexually harassed by a senior official . Mr Bird released details of text messages (some pictured above) to try to clear his name, but Ukip officials fear it is damaging the party by dragging private messages into the public domain . On Monday night Ukip announced that, after an internal inquiry, Mr Bird had been suspended ‘following allegations of impropriety’. Mr Bird told The Telegraph: 'I am going to make my case. Everything I am saying is backed by emails and text messages. There are plenty of emails and text messages between us which how it was a consensual relationship with interest on both sides. 'I have done nothing wrong. I am a single man, she is also single, we are both single people who conducted a consensual relationship outside the office. 'I'm very sorry that a story like his should have arisen because it detracts from our [Ukip's] central messages. The party had to respond in a formal way and conduct an appropriate investigation.' It is thought Mrs Bolter also has emails between the pair which could be made public in the coming days. When asked who out of her and Mr Bird was ‘lying big time’ about the nature of their friendship, Mrs Bolter hesitantly replied: ‘I think he… well I know he is lying ... I did not sleep with Roger Bird, end of.’ A Ukip pokesman refused to comment on the ongoing publicity battle, or the details of the case. He said: ‘We have an investigation about allegations of impropriety.’","Natasha Bolter claims Ukip general secretary Roger Bird propositioned her .

"He's a convicted peeping tom, caught secretly filming young women in the shower with a tiny camera installed in the bathroom ceiling fan, but now will not serve a single day in jail. Electrician Tristan Wootten was found guilty after he was busted with an elaborate camera set up at a home on the New South Wales Central Coast, north of Sydney, spying on his female tenants. Wootten was originally sentenced to two years jail after being found guilty of five counts of filming a person in a private act without consent, reported Nine's A Current Affair. On appeal, that sentence was reduced to 17 months before a district court judge ruled that could be served as an intensive correction order, which means home detention. Scroll down to video . Tristan Wootten (pictured) was found guilty of filming young women in the shower but his two year jail sentence was reduced to just home detention . One of his victims, Amy Peterson (pictured) says she can't believe he didn't go to jail, with just a 'slap on the wrist' being sent to home detention . His conditions include 32 hours of community service, a program to prevent him from re-offending and he will be subject to random home visits. Wootten was also found guilty of possessing child pornography, found by police when they discovered his camera set up. Amy Petersen, 21, was the one who discovered he had been spying on her when she was 18 and another young woman in their home, and can't believe he won't serve time. 'I thought justice would be served but obviously the court system is in favour of the criminals and not the victims,' she told ACA. The convicted peeping tom electrician installed an elaborate camera set up to film his female tenants while they were in the shower, he was also found with child pornography . The elaborate camera set up ( pictured) saw a tiny camera set up in the ceiling fan of the bathroom. Police discovered cables through the wall that lead into the garage . The elaborate set up ended in the garage (pictured) It was also discovered Wootten was first deemed unsuitable for an ICO (intensive corrections order) because he had broken up with his girlfriend and had no job or fixed address, according to ACA. But his lawyer was able to negotiate with the judge for him to be given a second chance, and he was. Despite being caught red handed and being found guilty, Wootten has walked free and will now live with his girlfriend. Ms Petersen wants justice to be served and has started a petition with change.org, calling for the attorney general to step in. 'Hearing his name still makes me physically sick,' she said in the petition. Victim Amy Petersen (pictured) says the incident has left her an emotional wreck and has now started a change.org petition asking the attorney general to appeal his sentence . The tiny camera used to spy of female tenants while they were showering was found in the ceiling fan (pictured) Tristan Wootten (pictured) had his two year jail sentence reduced to home detention and he will now live with his girlfriend . 'I always thought I would be safe in my own home. He took that away from me, made me terrified and so powerless.' 'A few weeks after my fiance and I moved in we felt like something was wrong, then we found he'd hidden tiny cameras and was watching us shower and undress without our knowledge.' 'It's left me an emotional wreck that I'm not sure I'll ever fully recover from,' she said. She said a 'slap on the wrist' was 'humiliating and degrading' and is hoping other people will sign her petition, to put a force behind appealing for him to go to jail.

"It seems the true meaning of Christmas really is being lost - with one in five children now believing Jesus Christ is a footballer for Chelsea FC. A new study also shows that 52 per cent of youngsters aged five to 12 think Christmas is Santa Claus' birthday. The nativity story appears to cause confusion for most, with 35 per cent believing Jesus was born in the South Pole and 27 per cent thinking Mary gave birth in a church. Jesus Christ, football superstar? One in five children now believing Jesus Christ is a footballer for Jose Mourinho's Chelsea FC, according to a new study by a shopping centre . Meanwhile, 10 per cent insist Rudolph the reindeer was in the stable at the time. The study of 1,000 youngsters, by Brent Cross shopping centre, reveals British children now struggle with the basics of the traditional Christmas story and instead believe the festive period is just about Santa and receiving gifts. It seems the birth of Jesus is not the only element of the nativity scene causing confusion. A quarter (25 per cent) now believe the shepherds found Jesus using Google Maps and 15 per cent claim the Three Kings gave Jesus a wand, tiara and wings as gifts to celebrate his birth. Among those who don't believe Jesus is a Chelsea striker, some believe he is an astronaut and others an X Factor contestant. The Christmas story: A quarter of children now believe the shepherds found Jesus using Google Maps and 15 per cent claim the Three Kings gave Jesus a wand, tiara and wings as gifts to celebrate his birth . To ensure children understand the true meaning of Christmas, Brent Cross shopping centre will be putting nativity knowledge to the test outside its grotto this December. Prior to seeing Santa, visitors will be quizzed on a series of festive issues to demonstrate the day is about more than mince pies and presents. Katie Tucker, Marketing Manager at Brent Cross, said: 'With children looking forward to the festive season the whole year round, we wanted to ensure the true meaning of celebration was understood. 'Hopefully, by proving to the kids at Brent Cross that Jesus Christ isn't a footballer they will fully appreciate the season of celebration and enjoy it even more.'","Study also reveals 35 per cent believe Jesus was born in the South Pole .

"The Capital One Cup is often heralded as the talent factory when it comes to English football. Paul Scholes, David Beckham and Cesc Fabregas all made their debuts in the competition, as many youngsters are given an opportunity to strut their stuff with the first team. So, as another round approaches, which young guns should you be watching out for at your club? Chuba Akpom (Arsenal, vs Southampton) Age: 18 . Nationality: England (Under 20, Under 19) A name which is probably familiar to most Arsenal fans, though Akpom has yet to be given a true chance to shine in the first team. A tall, quick and powerful striker, the 18-year-old has a fine scoring record with the youth ranks in North London and impressed on the right wing in the competition against West Brom last season. His mix of raw power and a much improved eye for goal has delighted Arsene Wenger, who says he is a 'huge talent'. Chuba Akpom has been described as a 'huge talent' by Arsene Wenger and could be a star of the future . Jordan Rossiter (Liverpool, vs Middlesbrough) Age: 17 . Nationality: England (Under 18) Labelled as a 'potential young Steven Gerrard' by Robbie Fowler, the pressure has been on young Rossiter since he was 15. The cultured midfielder seems to have dealt with it well, though, furthering his education with the youth team and seems to be the perfect mould for Brendan Rodgers. Jordan Henderson is out, so the time might be now for Rossiter to partner Gerrard in the centre. Jordan Rossiter was labelled as a young Steven Gerrard at the age of 15 . Jordi Hiwula (Manchester City, vs Sheffield Wednesday) Age: 18 . Nationality: England (Under 19) Despite being a lifelong United supporter Hiwula has really kicked on at Manchester City. Along with Devante Cole (son of Andy), has scored bags of goal for the Elite Development Squad under Patrick Vieira. Will possibly be competing with Jose Angel Pozo for a place in the squad with Edin Dzeko the only fit senior striker at the club, and could get the nod due to his speed and clinical edge up front. Jordi Hiwula could step up for Manchester City in the absence of Sergio Aguero and Edin Dzeko . Lewis Baker (Chelsea, vs Bolton) Age: 19 . Nationality: England (Under 20, Under 19) A mainstay last season as Chelsea won the FA Youth Cup, Baker shone with his dynamism in midfield and his box-to-box running. Made his senior debut against Derby earlier this year, and will hope for another opportunity against Sheffield Wednesday. Lewis Baker shone in a Chelsea youth team that won the FA Youth Cup last season . Isaac Hayden (Arsenal, vs Southampton) Age: 19 . Nationality: England (Under 20, Under 19) Another Gunner who featured in the match against West Brom, Hayden is a versatile who is another imposing figure in the youth team. Hayden is the captain of the Under 21 team, primarily at centre back, but his only experience under Wenger has come at the heart of midfield. Given the defensive casualties at Arsenal at the moment though, he is expected start in his favoured position against Southampton. The French boss admitted Hayden is 'now ready for that level'. Glowing praise, indeed. Isaac Hayden, pictured up against Danny Welbeck in training, is Arsenal's Under 21 captain . Semi Ajayi (Arsenal, vs Southampton) Age: 21 . Nationality: Nigerian . More of an unearthed diamond, Ajayi has followed a similar route as Carl Jenkinson in progressing to a possible debut. Signed from Charlton after a successful trial last year, the 21-year-old slotted straight into the second string and could be on the bench or even start depending on Calum Chambers' selection. Semi Ajayi was signed from Charlton last season and could feature, with Arsenal's defensive crisis . Sheyi Ojo (Liverpool, vs Middlesbrough) Age: 17 . Nationality: England (Under 18) Shot to fame with two goals against West Ham in the Under 21 Premier League earlier this month, and could be an option for Rodgers on the wing against Middlesbrough. Blessed with blistering pace and Raheem Sterling-like dribbling, Liverpool beat the likes of Chelsea to sign the 14-year-old for £2million from MK Dons in 2011. Sheyi Ojo has impressed this season for Liverpool's youth teams and is set for stardom . Matt Targett (Southampton, vs Arsenal) Age: 19 . Nationality: England (Under 20) If you thought Southampton's line of production was over after their summer departures, think again. Following on from Luke Shaw, Targett is a left-back who has been involved in the first team set-up this season, albeit on the bench. Tipped to shine this season by Ronald Koeman, the 19-year-old could step in for Ryan Bertrand on Tuesday night. Southampton's Matt Targett could be the next Luke Shaw at left back . Tyias Browning (Everton, vs Swansea) Age: 20 . Nationality: England (Under 21) The highly-rated versatile defender penned a new three-year contract at Everton in the summer, and could make his bow against Swansea. Able to carry the ball out of defence and a strong physical presence, Browning impressed in the Championship on loan at Wigan last season. Tyias Browning (left) is another fine Everton youth product and impressed on loan with Wigan last season . Sullay KaiKai (Crystal Palace, vs Newcastle) Age: 19 . Nationality: England . An immensely talented individual following on from Victor Moses and Wilfried Zaha, Kai-Kai hit a hat-trick for the development side earlier this month. Got a taste of senior football on loan at Crawley last season, and may be given the chance to shine by Neil Warnock.

"A former BBC manager with a 'pathological loathing' for Respect MP George Galloway has been jailed for attacking him in a London street while calling him an 'anti-semite little man'. Drug addict Neil Masterson, 39, punched the Bradford West MP ten times before delivering a 'Kung fu kick' during the frenzied assault in Notting Hill. Masterson - who was wearing a pink t-shirt with an Israel Defence Forces logo when arrested - told police he felt 'morally justified' in attacking the MP because he was a 'Nazi' with a 'shameful' attitude towards Jews, Isleworth Crown Court heard. A man has been jailed for 16 months after Respect MP George Galloway (pictured) was left with cuts and bruises following a 'frenzied assault' in Notting Hill in August this year . Drug addict Neil Masterson (pictured) - a former BBC manager and government worker - felt 'morally justified' in attacking the MP because he was a 'Nazi' with a 'shameful' attitude towards Jews, a court heard . Galloway - who now claims he cannot hug anyone without being in pain - believes he would have been killed if Masterson had been armed with a knife during their chance meeting, the court heard. Masterson, of Kensington, who had 'recently undergone a conversion towards Judaism', had previously admitted assaulting Mr Galloway, who he saw as a 'serpent' and 'enemy of Judaism', . The former government worker also admitted a second charge of common assault against Dr Mostafa Maroof, who had been posing for a photo with the MP and was pushed when he tried to intervene. But he denied that the attack - which left the politician with cuts and bruises to his head and ribs - was religiously aggravated. Sentencing Masterson to 16 months in jail, Judge Aidan Marron QC said the attack in August was a 'disturbing example' of public violence. He said: 'While you are no longer facing a charge of religiously aggravated assault, it would be unreal to ignore that the motivation for this ... was your profound hostility to Mr Galloway's views. 'It would have been much worse and continued longer had not two members of the public intervened robustly.' Mr Galloway - who had described his constituency as an 'Israel-free zone' earlier this year - welcomed the sentence but questioned the decision to drop a charge of religiously aggravated assault. He said: 'The sentence is reasonable in the circumstances. 'However, had the charge of religiously aggravated assault not been dropped I'm sure it would have been considerably longer and I fail to see why that charge was dropped given that he was wearing an IDF T-shirt and screaming about Israel at me. Galloway - who now claims he cannot hug anyone without being in pain - believes he would have been killed if Masterson had been armed with a knife during their chance meeting . After the attack, the Respect Party told its Twitter followers that Mr Galloway was on his way to hospital . 'If an Asian man wearing a Palestinian T-shirt had attacked a pro-Israeli MP would the sentence have been the same?' The court heard how the incident unfolded while the 60-year-old former Labour MP was in London on private business. Prosecutor Michelle Nelson told the court he was posing for a photo near his car in Golborne Road with Moroccan doctor Mostafa Maroof and a friend when Masterson approached them 'in a rage'. She said Masterson mentioned the Holocaust, leading Mr Galloway to fear the man was a right-wing extremist. Masterson then punched the MP ten times before delivering a 'Kung-fu style' kick which did not connect but caused Mr Galloway to fall into the road. The defendant then continued to hit him, the court was told. After being shoved, Mr Maroof and his friend managed to push Masterson away and prevent him from launching another attack. He then fled onto a bus, the court heard. The three men called 999 before getting into Mr Galloway's car to follow Masterson's bus, despite police telling them not to. Scene of the crime: The court heard how the incident unfolded while the 60-year-old former Labour MP was in London on private business in Notting Hill (pictured) They then managed to flag down a passing patrol car which stopped the bus. Officers arrested Masterson and seized a small amount of cannabis resin and a half empty bottle. Miss Nelson said: 'George Galloway says he saw the defendant running towards him shouting 'You f****** b*****'. The others heard him saying words to that effect. 'Mr Galloway quickly realised the words were aimed at him and that he was about to be assaulted. 'He is 61 years of age and said the man appeared extremely aggressive and looked powerful and formed the view he intended to harm him. 'In an effort to protect himself, he put his hands across his face and felt a series of rapid blows to his face and torso and the defendant ranted as he did so. 'He says the defendant launched a Kung Fu kick at him, which he tried to block with his hand. 'The defendant climbed on top of him and punched him about 10 times, mostly in the face but some to the upper and lower body. 'Throughout, he kept using profanities and George Galloway said he also heard the Holocaust mentioned, which led him to suspect that this might be a right wing extremist. 'The other men managed with great difficulty to pull him away and Mr Samir had to prevent him returning to Mr Galloway as the doctor helped him off the ground.' Masterson carried out the attack on Goldborne Road while shouting 'I f****** despite you,' the court heard . Ms Nelson said Masterson admitted to police he said 'Anti-semitic little man, I f****** despise you' during the attack and described Galloway as 'a morally and intellectually bankrupt person'. She added: 'The defendant said that he wanted to make Mr Galloway realise that his attitude towards Jews was shameful, it shames all Catholics and it shames anyone who has any idea of humanity. 'He felt he (Galloway) is a serpent in a way.' She continued: 'He felt he was morally justified in assaulting Mr Galloway. He said he thought Galloway was a Nazi and his political views were hate.' Mr Galloway spent the night at St Mary's hospital in Paddington where tests revealed three bruises on his forehead, a swollen jaw, bruised ribs and a tender spine. Mr Galloway is the MP for Bradford West and was formerly a member of the Labour party . He was given painkillers and discharged. In a victim impact statement read to the court, Mr Galloway described how he has been constantly on his guard since the attack. The statement read: 'I still have very painful ribs and take painkillers. 'Any warm embrace causes me pain, my left knee causes me great discomfort and I fear it will remain evermore. 'I am now on my guard when people meet me. It affects me, my lifestyle and my style of work. 'I never go anywhere alone, affecting my life. My family are in a constant state of worry and my seven-year-old son is worried and asks if I have my panic alarm to hand. 'My wife calls me and panics if I do not answer.' Mr Galloway is seeking help from the House of Commons and his party for the anxiety he now suffers, the court was told. Miss Nelson described how, when interviewed under caution, Masterson said he had been on his way to a Sikh shop when he saw Mr Galloway with 'two confederates'. He suddenly felt 'very, very angry' and ran, shouting, towards them, she said. Miss Nelson told the court: 'He spoke at some length about the harassment the Jewish community suffers, saying they would leave and we will be left with a ""very very vocal Islamic rump"". 'He remembered knocking Mr Galloway's hat off and said ""He dared not look at me"" and ""I saw fear in his eyes"".' She told how he spoke of 'knowingly, willingly and angrily' attacking the MP and added: 'I know it sounds pompous, but you know you are doing something right when your enemies are afraid'. The court heard how Masterson told officers his motives for the 'frenzied' attack was 'to make him realise that this attitude to Jews was shameful and shames all Catholics'. He had told police: 'I feel like he is a serpent in a way. He is opposed to Israel and anyone who is an enemy of Israel is an enemy of freedom in the country. We need to rip them from the earth. 'Galloway is like a henchman, he has got a fashionable cache that attracts people but I think I know his true character.' Masterson is a full-time carer for a woman suffering from Crohn's disease, memory problems and an inflamed gall bladder. Jonathan Mann, defending, said his client had a 'pathological loathing' of Mr Galloway but regretted what he had done after he 'calmed down'.

"A cliff-edge hotel could soon collapse into the sea after authorities decided they couldn't afford the cost of building defences. The Blue Anchor Hotel, overlooking the cliffs at Minehead, in Somerset, has been forced to close its children's garden play area that backs on to the cliffs which are crumbling at a dangerous rate of a metre a month. The play area's ship was moved at a cost of £800,000 a year ago to a safer location - one that is now crumbling, as more huge chunks of the beer garden slump onto the beach. Scroll down for video... The Blue Anchor Hotel in Minehead could be lost to coastal erosion after funding for a rescue plan was withdrawn by authorities . The hotel has reduced the size of its beer garden due to the erosion with 13ft slipping into the sea in just three months . The regulars joke that they stand on the landward side to even things up. A plan to build a flood defence wall to keep the hotel from falling into the sea has been abandoned. In September, a funding bid was made for £570,000 to build a new section of sea wall between the threatened hotel and Watchet. But West Somerset Council says it is now dropping its bid altogether due to time pressures and a financial risk. The cliffs at Minehead in Somerset are at risk of collapse by a process called abrasion. This is when the waves crash against the foot, or the toe of the cliff, and start to erode the soft rock. As the base of the cliff becomes smaller and weaker, it is no longer able to support the weight above it, and this is when the overhang is at risk of crashing into the sea. The cliffs at Minehead are red sandstone, and interestingly are harder at the bottom. Three or four metres up the rock is softer as there is less stone content. Many cliffs in the south west of the UK are described as 'soft' - often chalky rock or sandstone, whereas many cliffs in the north are granite and described as 'hard'. - Information provided to MailOnline Travel by the Environment Agency . The Environment Agency has £570,000 ready to spend extending the sea defences here - but won't spend it unless tiny West Somerset Council provides a consultant's report and pays survey costs. The council, the smallest in the country, says it cannot afford that, and that the government will need to step in and find the extra funds. Bridgwater and West Somerset MP Ian Liddell-Grainger said the council's decision was 'utterly ridiculous. The landlord of the hotel, Simon Strom, said the property lost 13ft of garden in three months last winter and said if the cliff was not shored up the hotel would fall into the sea. He said: 'I can't do anything. 'All I have got to do is sit here and wait for it to fall in. 'It's just a matter of time before the erosion reaches the hotel. 'It does depend on the high tides and the winters, because obviously we've had a nice summer so the ground has hardened. 'Then you get the high tides, the storms and it just starts cracking again - that's the problem.' Senior councillor, Anthony Trollope-Bellew, said: 'We have been faced with an impossible combination of circumstances - extraordinarily tight deadlines and substantial financial risks. 'It's not very hopeful for the hotel and everybody at West Somerset Council very much regrets that. 'We have made every effort to help the hotel up till now, but we cannot help anymore I'm afraid.' The hotel was forced to close its children's play area which backs onto the cliffs and it was moved at a cost of £800,000 - but now that is back in danger . He said the risks included the council having to underwrite the project financially and meet consultation and procurement rules within a stated deadline. Some £11,500 has already been spent by the local authority on the first stages of the application for Environment Agency money. Conservative MP Mr Liddell-Grainger said the council's lack of involvement is ridiculous. 'The hotel and possibly the road could go into the sea, which would be a disaster,' he said. 'But the original report that was done by West Somerset Council the Environment Agency quite rightly threw out; it was appalling. A plan to build a flood defence wall to keep the Somerset hotel from falling into the sea has been abandoned . The Blue Anchor Hotel in Minehead could be lost to coastal erosion after funding for a rescue plan was withdrawn by authorities . The cliffs that support the Blue Anchor Hotel are made of red sandstone and are being worn away by a coastal erosion process called abrasion . 'So now they have taken the easy route and just said, well if it falls into the sea, it falls into the sea. 'Not acceptable! You cannot have the coastline of West Somerset held hostage by a council that doesn't care. 'I am not prepared to tolerate this shirking of responsibility on such a crucial issue as this and I am taking up the matter immediately at ministerial level with a request that West Somerset be forced to progress the scheme.' The final decision will be made at a council meeting on December 17, but the recommendation is that the council halts the bidding process.","The Blue Anchor Hotel overlooks cliffs at Minehead in Somerset .

"Homes have their own plainclothes security guards – or a concierge who will do everything from walk your dog to arranging a private jet. This is Britain’s most expensive street, where the average property sells for almost £17million. Grosvenor Crescent, in London’s Belgravia, topped a list of 50 exclusive addresses in a survey by Lloyds Bank. Britain's most expensive street: Grosvenor Crescent, in London’s Belgravia, topped a list of 50 exclusive addresses in a survey by Lloyds Bank . Despite the eye-watering prices, almost all of the properties on the 19th century crescent are flats rather than houses. Apartments on the Grade II-listed street, close to Hyde Park, are mainly owned by multi-millionaires from Russia, eastern Europe and the Middle East – many of whom use them as a second or third home. The next most expensive street was nearby Eaton Square, where property sells for an average of £15.5million and former residents include Nigella Lawson. The celebrity chef once owned a £25million home at the address and property tycoon Scot Young, who fell to his death this week from his flat in Marylebone, also owned an apartment there. London and the South East dominated the top 50 list of priciest streets – with the top ten all in the capital’s wealthy enclaves of Belgravia, Knightsbridge, Kensington, Chelsea and Notting Hill. However there was an entry from the north of England. Houses in Park Lane in Altrincham, Cheshire, sell for about £2.5million and are occupied by entrepreneurs and Premier League footballers. The South West also had just one entry – the peninsula of Sandbanks in Poole, Dorset, where the average property also costs £2.5million. Yesterday, a security guard for a Qatari family who live in a flat in Grosvenor Crescent described the homes as ‘big, very big’. He said: ‘We always have security on guard and there is CCTV. If you’re a visitor, you have to arrange an appointment and then be searched when you come in.’ The street is also home to the Belgian embassy, while numbers 3-10 were for many years the headquarters of the British Red Cross before it was sold in 2005 for £30million and again in 2008 for £85million. The block is now owned by the Grosvenor Group – controlled by the Duke of Westminster, one of Britain’s wealthiest landowners. The firm has turned the building into lavish flats, some with their own private swimming pools, gyms and underground parking along with Italian marble floors. Aaron Harris, a concierge at the block, has everything from private jet companies to pet grooming services on speed dial for the block’s demanding residents. The second most expensive street on the list was nearby Eaton Square, where property sells for an average of £15.5million and former residents include Nigella Lawson . This unique property on the peninsula of Sandbanks in Poole, Dorset , was sold for £6million in 2012. The average property on Sandbanks sells for £2.5million . He said recently: ‘Their own PAs are not always around at three or four o’clock in the morning and that’s where we come in.’ Outside the capital, the most expensive streets were in Oxshott, Surrey – where tennis ace Andy Murray lives. Homes there sell for over £3.6million. A separate regional breakdown reveals exclusive hotspots in Stratford-upon-Avon, Harrogate and Leicester. The highly desirable Park Lane, Altrincham, Cheshire has an average property price of £2.5million and has been popular with footballers in the past . Runnymede Road in Ponteland, Northumberland - where the average house price is £1.2million . Rutland Drive in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, boasts an average property price of £1.2million . The Ridgeway in Rothley, Leicestershire, has an average property price of £1.8million .

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott - the target of Julia Gillard's famous misogyny speech - has suggested sexism was behind recent criticisms of his powerful chief of staff. Mr Abbott today slapped down members of his own party following reports this week of growing tension between Peta Credlin - his top adviser - and coalition ministers. 'Do you really think that my chief of staff would be under this kind of criticism if her name was P-E-T-E-R as opposed to P-E-T-A?' Mr Abbott told ABC television. 'I think people need to take a long hard look at themselves with some of these criticisms.' Scroll down for video . Statement: Prime Minister Tony Abbott has the attacks on his chief adviser Peta Credlin are motivated by sexism . 'I think people need to take a good hard look at themselves': Mr Abbott has rushed to the defence of his chief of staff . Power player: Peta Credlin, pictured, is considered a significant figure in the Abbott Government - but her control over government ministers has reportedly led to tensions . 'They're like two Siamese fighting fish in the same tank': Earlier this week, that is what a Liberal frontbencher reportedly said about Ms Credlin, left, and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop . Pictured today: Prime Minister Tony Abbott's remarks set off a social media storm on Friday morning . 'Do you really think that my chief of staff would be under this kind of criticism if her name was P-E-T-E-R as opposed to P-E-T-A? 'I think people need to take a long hard look at themselves with some of these criticisms. 'This is the same office which ran a very effective opposition, it's the same office which has got an enormous amount done this year sometimes under very difficult circumstances.' Mr Abbott's statement has already set the Twittersphere tittering as the prime minister has long been targeted by critics - fairly or unfairly, depending on your view - over his apparent 'women problem.' When he was Opposition Leader, Prime Minister Gillard famously savaged Mr Abbott's perceived attitudes to women in a speech on the floor of Parliament. 'I will not be lectured on sexism or misogny by this man,' she said, in a speech that soon went viral. Mr Abbott's appearance at a 2011 anti-carbon tax rally in front of signs reading 'Ditch the witch' and 'Juliar  is Bob Brown's b****' was similarly controversial. And in May, Mr Abbott was forced to apologise after he winked at ABC Radio presenter Jon Faine when a talkback caller announced she was a sex worker. The prime minister's remarks today follow claims this week that Foreign Minister Julie Bishop - the only senior female minister in the Abbott Government - had fallen out with Ms Credlin. 'They're like two Siamese fighting fish in the same tank,' a senior Coalition source told The Australian newspaper on Tuesday. The Foreign Minister has reportedly decided not to take any orders from Ms Credlin and other senior Cabinet members are concerned Mr Abbott's chief aide wields too much power. But Mr Abbott today said if people had a problem with his office they should bring the complaints to him. Man's man: Mr Abbott is pictured on Thursday with visiting Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko . 'I shouldn't have done it, Karl': Mr Abbott later apologised after he winked at a radio presenter when a caller announced she was a sex worker . Controversy: Mr Abbott's appearance in front of these signs at a 2011 anti-carbon tax rally was also a major topic of criticism . Target: Prime Minister Julia Gillard, pictured here, rounded on Mr Abbott in her famous 'misogny' speech . We are a place where opposition leaders, prime ministers, ministers and shadow ministers should be judged on their record, should be judged on their deeds, not on their gender and, frankly, as the father of three daughters I want them to be judged on what they do. I do not want them to be judged favourably or unfavourably on the basis of their gender and I think it’s time that everyone in the Parliament moved on from this gender card which so many members of the Government have been playing. Source: Doorstop press conference, 10 October 2012 . 'This is the same office which ran a very effective opposition, it's the same office which has got an enormous amount done this year sometimes under very difficult circumstances,' he said. There has been growing speculation of disunity in Coalition ranks recently. Late last week, the Australian Financial Review reported that Ms Bishop 'went bananas' at Mr Abbott when she was not consulted about a plan for a male colleague to 'chaperone' her to a climate change conference in Lima, Peru. It was claimed Trade Minister Andrew Robb was accompanying Ms Bishop to ensure Australia did not over-commit on his climate change policy promises. The bust-ups have overshadowed a significant announcement in Lima by Ms Bishop that Australia will contribute $200 million to a global fund to help poorer nations tackle climate change. Mr Abbott last week admitted the government had been performing in a 'ragged' way recently. This week, he watered down his plans to introduce a GP co-payment, canning his initial policy of introducing a $7 fee for most Australians when they visit the doctor. Colleagues:  Julie Bishop took issue with Tony Abbott's decision to 'chaperone' her at the United Nations conference and now there are claims she is at odds with his chief of staff, Peta Credlin . One front-bencher says Julie Bishop is unhappy at the level of control Peta Credlin as the PM's chief of staff.

"You have to admire the pluck. Porto Montenegro, once the main base for the Austro-Hungarian navy, is now home to super-yachts, gin palaces, infinity pools, nightclubs, fleets of helicopters - and festering controversy. It's has Monte Carlo in its sights; St Tropez and Porto Banus, too. Boats, boats everywhere you look: The harbour at Porto Montenegro is the place to park your super yacht . All it needs now is a little time and a few more millions. For the rest of us, watching its development will be fun. Canadian gold mining billionaire Peter Munk, a refugee from Nazi-occupied Hungary, is the chief investor. A friend of Munk's from Toronto says that when he visited Porto Montenegro seven years ago, the site resembled Pearl Harbor after the Japanese attack. Not any more. Its first five-star hotel, The Regent, has just opened and Lord [Jacob] Rothschild, an investor, was there to witness it. 'It's a miracle.' he said. 'I look forward to coming back here again and again.' Sadly, there was no sign of his old friend Oleg Deripaska, the Russian oligarch. Serene scene: The Regent, which opened in August this year, is Porto Montenegro's first five-star hotel . The latter has a house here but has fallen out with the prime minister Milo Dukanovic over an aluminium smelter he bought, later putting thousands of local people out of jobs. Porto Montenegro is described as the deepest natural harbour in Southern Europe and Kotor Bay is said to contain 42,000 species of fish. It is next to the town of Tivat, which has a small airport, although most visitors use Dubrovnik airport 27 miles away. Beauty of the bay: The Bay of Kotor, a UNESCO World Heritage site, was admired by Lord Byron . Nearby, the town of Kotor is a UNESCO World Heritage site with baroque, Venetian and Austrian architecture. It is surrounded by spectacular untouched mountain scenery. Porto Montenegro is still in touch with its past. Two cold war submarines, now open to the public, stand on the harbour shore, and the sawmill and repair yard have been turned into a maritime museum. Lord Byron described Kotor Bay as 'the most beautiful encounter of land and sea'. What he would make of modern Porto Montenegro we will never know. But it's some spectacle.

"Labour leader Ed Miliband will use a speech today to set out how he plans to tackle the country's vast deficit . Ed Miliband's bid to restore Labour's battered economic credibility backfired spectacularly last night. He pledged that reducing the deficit would be a priority if he wins the election but independent experts warned his plans would mean 'much more borrowing and debt'. The Labour leader – who forgot to mention the deficit in his party conference speech this year and has spent the past four years attacking Tory cuts – refused to say how and where he would reduce spending. Mr Miliband claimed Labour would impose 'year on year' spending cuts to reduce the deficit, saying it was his 'first pledge of the election campaign'. And he admitted that being seen to deal with the huge budget deficit left by the last Labour government was now 'an essential test of credibility' for the party, which lags far behind the Conservatives on the issue in opinion polls. Mr Miliband pledged to bring day-to-day government spending back into balance 'as soon as possible'. But he gave no date for bringing the public finances back into the black – suggesting that Britain's towering debts would continue to rise indefinitely under Labour. And though he said Labour was working on plans for 'common sense spending reductions', he refused to spell out where the axe would fall, saying the full detail would be released only after a Labour victory in next May's General Election. Experts warned that his lax rules on public finances would rack up gigantic debts for future generations. Labour would continue to borrow for capital spending on things such as transport infrastructure, which is forecast to hit £27billion by 2020. And Mr Miliband rejected Mr Osborne's target of running a £23billion budget surplus that year, potentially allowing him an extra £50billion in spending and borrowing by 2020. Advertising firm Clear Channel today tweeted this picture of the billboard using the slogan which Mr Miliband was challenged to come up with this morning . When your opponents are threatening to outspend you ahead of the election, you'd be happy with any free publicity. But Ed Miliband could not have predicted he would see his name up in neon lights in Piccadilly Circus after bungling an attempt to come up with a snappy campaign slogan. The Labour leader was asked by Andrew Morley, the chief executive of advertising firm Clear Channel, to failed to sum up his message to voters in eight words. He came up with 10. They were: 'A country that works for you, not the privileged few.' But five hours later the slogan, together with a picture of Mr Miliband, was emblazoned across the world famous screens of Piccadilly Circus, witness by tourists, office workers and passing taxis. A spokesman for the firm said: 'We took the decision to provide the space free of charge following a humorous exchange between our chief executive Andrew Morley and Mr Miliband earlier in the day. Carl Emmerson, deputy director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said Mr Miliband and his Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls had left themselves 'a lot of wiggle room' to let them get away with spending cuts that were 'very shallow indeed'. Mr Emmerson told Radio 4's The World At One: 'You would get much, much less spending cuts potentially under a Labour government but you'd have much more borrowing and therefore more government debt.' George Osborne warned that Labour's plans would mean 'economic chaos'. Public spending as a share of the entire economy will fall to just 35.2 per cent by 2018-19, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility's forecasts of spending cuts . Under the latest forecasts, the deficit will fall from £91billion this year to put the country in surplus by 2018-19, but Labour has promised to only reach that point by 2020 . Lord Mandelson said the rise of parties like Ukip was due to the failure of mainstream politicians . Labour was part of an elite that helped 'screw up' the economy, Lord Mandelson admitted yesterday. The former business secretary said the rise of parties like Ukip in the West was partly due to the failure of mainstream politicians and institutions to prevent the financial crash. He suggested the last Labour government, in which he played a leading role, was among those that had failed on the issue. Speaking to the Institute for Public Policy Research in London yesterday, Lord Mandelson said: 'So many voters have turned outwards from the mainstream because they think those of us in the mainstream have screwed it up – and arguably we did. 'The financial crisis, and the crisis in the banks and sovereign debt – they were man-made. 'I'm not saying it was made in Europe, but the fact is we didn't have enough strength in our systems and structures to enable us to deal with the impact of the crisis. 'So we did screw up – the whole political, business and financial elite of the Western world – and you can't blame people for saying so.' In a separate interview with Prospect magazine, Lord Mandelson suggested Britain was heading for another hung parliament after next year's election. He said a Tory majority appeared impossible, but suggested an outright win for Labour under Ed Miliband 'also looks less likely'. The Chancellor said Mr Miliband and his party 'created the deficit and by delaying paying off the deficit what he's really telling the British people is that he would borrow more and put up taxes'. Mr Miliband claimed the Conservatives were proposing 'extreme' cuts. He pointed to official forecasts suggesting that, under Tory plans, the size of the state will shrink to its lowest level since the mid-1930s. But Mr Emmerson said the comparison was misleading. 'The size of the government as measured as a share of national income would indeed be back to the level last seen in the late 1930s,' he said. 'But that is not to say that living standards would be anything like they were in the 1930s. Our GDP is substantially higher than that, and therefore the amount we have to spend on our private consumption, on our public services in real terms is significantly higher.' Mr Miliband said Labour had already spelled out some modest cuts, such as ending the winter fuel allowance for better-off pensioners, as well as proposing new taxes, such as a mansion tax on homes worth more than £2million. Labour announced yesterday that it would also save more than £500million a year from local government budgets by cutting bureaucracy, scrapping a Coalition scheme to boost house building and considering mergers of fire and rescue services. But the savings identified so far pale in comparison with Britain's £91billion annual deficit. The Labour leader also claimed that Britain's 'cost of living crisis' was holding back the recovery – just as official figures showed that Britain's standard of living has risen to be the fourth highest in the EU. The Eurostat figures suggest the UK has overtaken the Netherlands and is well ahead of France, Italy and Spain, with a standard of living 15 per cent above the EU average. Only Luxembourg, Germany and Austria are ahead of the UK. n Mr Miliband came unstuck yesterday when an advertising executive asked him to devise a short election slogan. Told it should be no more than eight words – and despite counting on his fingers – he came up with the effort 'A country that works for you, not the privileged few' – a ten-word slogan.","Miliband admits years of cuts needed to deal with the nation's deficit .

"Nike has filed a lawsuit against three of its former footwear designers seeking $10million in damages over allegations that they stole 'a treasure trove' of trade secrets before joining its arch-rival Adidas. High-ranking designers Marc Dolce, Mark Miner and Denis Dekovic announced their departure from Nike in September to join Adidas at its new design studio - dubbed the Brooklyn Creative Studio in Brooklyn, New York. In the lawsuit, a copy of which was published on digital library Scribd, Nike alleges that this new studio is essentially a knock-off of its own Portland Oregeon-based hub, The Innovation Kitchen, and that its former designers had been 'conspiring' with Adidas to 'develop a blueprint' since April. Sued: Former Nike designers Mark Miner (left), Denis Dekovic (center) and Marc Dolce (right) stand accused of stealing intellectual property to take jobs at Adidas, then destroying the evidence . Mr Dolce was formerly Nike's global basketball and training design director, Mr Dekovich was the brand's global football design director and Mr Miner was a senior global footwear designer. According to Nike's allegations, the designers stole 'future strategic development plans, product launches, unreleased product technology, virtual testing methodologies and marketing campaign materials.' Nike further claims that before the designers left their positions, they erased incriminating emails and text messages in a bid to hide 'evidence of their betrayals.' Mr Dekovic responded by releasing a statement on behalf on himself, Mr Dolce and Mr Miner via his Twitter account on Tuesday. 'We find Nike's allegations hurtful because they are either false or are misleading half-truths,' it said. 'We did not take trade secrets or intellectual property when we departed Nike in September. 'During our entire careers at Nike... we collectively poured in hours, passion and dedication beyond what was asked or expected of us, often prioritizing our jobs over our families. 'Until the very end, we stayed engaged, loyal and committed.' Denied: Mr Dekovic responded by releasing a statement on behalf on himself, Mr Dolce and Mr Miner via his Twitter account on Tuesday (pictured) Nike claims the three designers 'conspired to and developed for themselves, and then for Adidas, a strategic blueprint for a creative design studio to compete against Nike.' The company states it has spent more than $1.5million in the past three years to ensure that its employees keep information confidential and that it will 'continue to vigorously protect our intellectual property.' Mr Dekovic confirmed his departure from Nike on Twitter in September, with the poetic post: 'GRATEFUL for the past, EXCITED for the future, 3 brothers, 3 dreamers, 3 stripes. #TeamAdidas 2015.' Nike states in its legal complaint that its former designers 'boasted online about their new affiliation with Adidas to generate support for and lure other designers to join their enterprise.' It added: 'Nike will suffer irreparable harm if this scheme is permitted to continue.' Matt Powell, a sports industry analyst at the NPD Group, told The Washington Post. '[Mr Devovik, Mr Dolce and Mr Miner] were all three rock stars of the design world. This is a huge loss for Nike and a gain for Adidas, and it’ll take many, many months for all this to play out.'","Designers Marc Dolce, Mark Miner and Denis Dekovic announced their departure from Nike to join Adidas in September .

"A woman's funeral was postponed because her heartbroken and 'utterly devoted' husband was found hanging just a day before the service. Father-of-two Michael Hopper, 68, was discovered by police at his £400,000 home in Warminster, Wiltshire, on November 27. His wife, 65-year-old chemist dispenser Christine, had passed away there 11 days before he was found. Yesterday Warminster Rector, the Reverend Dennis Brett, said: 'I was going to conduct her service on November 28. Christine Hopper's funeral service was due to be held at West Wiltshire Crematorium (pictured) last month . 'Her funeral was postponed so there can be a joint service on December 16. It is tragic.' It is understood people had turned up to mourn her death at West Wiltshire Crematorium. June Perkins, a former neighbour of the couple, said: 'They were so utterly devoted to each other. They were so very close. It is so very sad. 'He would not know what to do with himself after he lost her.' Mr Hopper, a retired teacher, was found by the same police officer on November 27 who went to the house when his wife died on November 16. Yesterday Wiltshire Police stressed there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding Mr Hopper's death. Police also confirmed they went to the house 11 days earlier after a call from the Ambulance Service regarding Mrs Hopper's death. 'But there were no suspicious circumstances over her death.' West Wiltshire Crematorium confirmed the double funeral would be held on 16 December. An inquest at Salisbury, Wiltshire, was told that Michael George Jeffery Hopper was found hanging by a police officer at his home in mid evening on 27 November. Toxicology tests were ordered.

"Spanking and whipping should not be banned in British-made online porn videos, Lib Dem MPs have demanded. Backbench MP Julian Huppert attacked rules revealed last week which ban a host of erotic acts considered 'harmful' by ministers. The new laws aim to bring 'video-on-demand' online porn into line with videos sold in licensed sex shops. It means around 10 acts - ranging from spanking to strangulation, aggressive whipping and being tied up – are now banned from web porn sold in the UK. Mr Huppert has tabled a Commons motion calling for the new rules – laid down in the Audiovisual Media Services Regulation 2014 – to be annulled. Mr Huppert, MP for Cambridge, said the new rules 'mean that all video-on-demand services that originate from the UK can't show various acts, such as spanking'. He said: 'It seems to me to be very odd to say that this - assuming it is consensual - is acceptable for somebody to do in their own home, for them to photograph it, film it, but not to look at it online if it comes from the UK. 'To me the case for banning things should be driven by issues around consent, and around genuine risk, not about whether we happen to like things or not.' Banned content includes 'the portrayal of sexual activity which involves real or apparent lack of consent' and 'the infliction of pain or acts which may cause lasting physical harm'. This effectively outlaws acts including physical or verbal abuse (whether or not it is consensual), physical restraint, caning and strangulation. A Government spokesman said: 'The legislation provides the same level of protection to the online world that exists on the high street in relation to the sale of physical DVDs. 'In a converging media world these provisions must be coherent and the BBFC classification regime is a tried and tested system of what content is regarded as harmful for minors.' But critics argue the change not only damages the country's porn industry, with online viewers still able to access content banned in the UK by watching videos filmed abroad, but amounts to 'arbitrary censorship'. A number of 'Fifty Shades of Grey' style sex acts have been banned from online porn made in the UK. A movie based on the erotic novel is currently being made staring Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson (pictured) Spanking and whipping, which are featured in the saucy novel Fifty Shades of Grey, are on the banned list, as well as: . Aggressive whipping . Physical or verbal abuse (regardless of if consensual) Strangulation . Jerry Barnett, founder of anti-censorship campaign Sex And Censorship, told Vice News: 'R18 is a strange thing. 'It's a set of weird and arbitrary censorship rules decided between the BBFC, the police and the CPS (Crown Prosecution Service). 'There appear to be no rational explanations for most of the R18 rules - they're simply a set of moral judgments designed by people who have struggled endlessly to stop the British people from watching pornography.' The Audiovisual Media Services Regulation 2014 came in to effect on Monday. Erotic film director Erika Lust told the Independent: 'With this legislation, the UK is in danger of finding itself back in an age where porn is simply the boring, unrealistic, male fantasy of bimbos eagerly pleasing men as if it is their duty, where women are submissive and lack ownership of their sexuality. 'Women in the industry will now fear the loss of their livelihoods as well as their sexual independence.'","Backbench MP Julian Huppert attacked new online porn crackdown .

"Their drive-bys and drug-fueled violence have played out across the grid-locked streets of Los Angeles for the past 70 years - becoming a notorious part of American popular culture. But now the Big Hazard gang that held such a fearsome grip on the Ramona Gardens housing project in Boyle Heights has been dealt a blow after the LAPD, FBI and the IRS indicted 38 members in the largest crackdown ever on the Mexican mafia. Gang members with names such as raccoon, grizzly, creeper and ghost were among 29 suspected members taken in on federal racketeering charges. Los Angeles, California, United States: A suspect is processed in downtown Los Angeles after at least 38 members of the Big Hazard gang were indicted under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization (RICO) statutes, federal officials said . Raids: The LAPD and the FBI joined forces to arrest 29 suspected members of the Big Hazard gang in Los Angles on Wednesday . Arrested: The indictment outlines criminal activity ranging from drug trafficking to intimidation and alleges close ties with the Mexican Mafia . The Mexican Mafia is a powerful collection of prison inmates from various Latino gangs who call shots on violence behind bars and drug dealing and crime on the streets. The FBI and Los Angeles police led early morning raids, dubbed 'Operation Resident Evil,' at more than a dozen homes. 'We have moved to take control of the neighborhood,' Acting US Attorney Stephanie Yonekura said. They nabbed 24 of those named in the indictment, along with four others charged with crimes related to the gang. Seven people, including the gang's leader, were already in custody. One defendant named was killed in a shooting over the weekend that is being investigated. Battle: 'We have moved to take control of the neighborhood,' Acting U.S. Atty. Stephanie Yonekura said at a press conference on Wednesday . Men and women:The arrests culminated a four-year investigation that began after a car crash and shooting on Interstate 10 . Haul: Weapons seized after hundreds of law enforcement officers raided homes on the east side of Los Angeles, searching for Big Hazard gang members with ties to the Mexican Mafia . Indictments: A poster showing the crossed-out faces of those arrested, and of a few who weren't, is seen at a news conference after law enforcement officers raided homes on the east side of Los Angeles . The arrests culminated a four-year investigation that began after a car crash and shooting on Interstate 10. Police searching the car, which belonged to a suspected drug dealer, found letters written in code from Manuel Larry Jackson, a Hazard gang member serving time at a super maximum-security federal prison in Colorado for bank robbery and attempting to kill another inmate. When authorities discovered Jackson, a member of the Mexican Mafia who headed the Hazard gang, was about to be released from prison, they launched a task force to look into the gang, said Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for federal prosecutors. Once released, Jackson was snared in a separate investigation involving the Mexican Mafia and its connection to the La Familia drug cartel in Mexico. Jackson, 51, also known as 'Cricket,' is being held on charges related to distributing methamphetamine. His lawyer declined to comment on the new charges.

Fearsome: This undated photo provided by the U.S. Department of Justice shows a tattoo on a member of the Big Hazard gang . Police out: A gang mural, one of several tags and grafitti vandalism marking the territory of the Big Hazard gang . Each defendant faces sentences ranging from 10 years to life without parole, if convicted. Believed to have about 350 members, the Big Hazard gang is headquartered in the Ramona Gardens housing project and got its start in the 1940s, the indictment said. It took its name from nearby Hazard Park. The gang's main source of revenue came from dealing methamphetamine, crack cocaine and heroin and controlling the drug trade in Boyle Heights, a largely Latino neighborhood just east of downtown. It collected 'rent' from other dealers operating in the area, keeping some of that money and paying some as 'taxes' to the Mexican Mafia. All of the gang's activities were enforced through intimidation, with members threatening and following through with violence against rivals, law abiding citizens and even fellow gang members who cooperated with police, Yonekura said. Paramedics evacuate a gang member after a gang shooting in Boyle Heights November 2, 2002 in East Los Angeles, California. Boyle Heights, a Latino neighborhood rife with gangs, has one of the city's highest gang shooting rates . Trouble: A police officer interviews witnesses and suspects after a gang shooting in Boyle Heights, November 20, 2002 in East Los Angeles, California . In one instance, the gang extorted money from a family that had allowed police to search their garage for a gang suspect. 'That fear and intimidation is right below the surface, and the community feels it,' Los Angeles Police Deputy Chief Kirk Albanese to the Los Angeles Times. 'Even though it may not be as outward as it was 15 years ago, the fear is inside of people, and we're trying to prevent that. This is a war. Today was a battle, and we're going to continue until we win the war.' The gang used lookouts, surveillance cameras and guns to protect their operations and filed bogus complaints against police officers to get them transferred to other areas, according to the indictment. Agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives displayed more than a dozen guns seized during the raids, including semi-automatic rifles and handguns, a .44 Magnum revolver and a gun disguised as a pen. While the indictment said the gang was responsible for murders, it didn't specify how many. Authorities at the news conference didn't have that figure, though Deputy Los Angeles Police Chief Kirk Albanese said the gang was 'responsible for a lot of death and carnage over the years.'","Hundreds of law enforcement officers raided homes in East Los Angeles on Wednesday .

"A coroner says a 79-year-old hunter found dead in the western Pennsylvania woods accidentally shot himself with his own rifle. The body of James Turnbull, of White Township, was discovered by another deer hunter shortly before 5 pm Wednesday in a wooded area of the township. Indiana County Coroner Jerry Overman Jr. says in a news release Thursday that, 'Foul play or involvement by another hunter has been ruled out.' Tragic: A Pennsylvania hunter, 79, accidentally shot himself dead while hunting deer on Wednesday [stock image] . What's unclear is how the gun went off. The Pennsylvania Game Commission, state police and the coroner were continuing to investigate. White Township is about 45 miles northeast of Pittsburgh. A similar tragedy occurred just last month in neighboring New Jersey where authorities say a goose hunter who was out with his father died after he accidentally shot himself in the head and neck. The victim, identified only as a 45-year-old Chesterfield man, was pronounced dead at the scene. The father apparently was not injured. Authorities say the two men were hunting by themselves and had Canada goose decoys spread out in front of their blind. They said both men were properly licensed to hunt the birds. And in Maine, wardens say that days before a 30-year-old Mattawamkeag man shot himself in the arm and torso when he lost his footing along a riverbank, causing his rifle to discharge. Wardens say Aaron Burke was in serious condition after being shot Thursday morning. Wardens say he was hunting deer along the Mattawamkeag River when he slipped, causing his 30-30 rifle to discharge. Wardens say he managed to climb a riverbank and make his way out of the woods to call for help.",James Turnbull of White Township was discovered dead by another deer hunter on Wednesday .
"Shahab Reza, 52, of Perivale, London (pictured outside an earlier court hearing), has admitted his role in the scam and now faces years behind bars . A deaf couple fuelled a lavish lifestyle by using their disability to pocket nearly £1million in a sophisticated benefits fraud. Shahab Reza, 52, and his wife Shahnaz, 53, were described as ‘breathtakingly arrogant’ after using the money to buy luxury properties and jewellery, including a ‘flawless’ £8,000 diamond. The couple set up a complex network of fake companies around the world while still receiving benefits. By submitting bogus invoices for sign language interpreters, they duped officials out of the huge sums with ‘scandalous ease’. The elaborate scam saw the greedy couple net £800,000. They also lied to a council about their financial position, getting a further £100,000 in other benefits and tax exemptions. They used the money, which was earmarked to help vulnerable individuals find work, to fund a holiday to Dubai, where they bought a £600,000 penthouse apartment. Shahab Reza, an accountant who was described as the mastermind of the fraud, even recruited his university-educated children to take part in the scheme. Their son Abbas, 26, and daughter Zainab, 22, spoke on their parents’ behalf and signed off paperwork from their early teenage years. Abbas, who works as a doctor, even used the money to fund a ‘jolly’ to America while still a student and the siblings allegedly used the companies to harvest false expenses claims. The children said they were ‘doing what they were told’ by their malicious father, who abused their vulnerability. Shahab Reza orchestrated the four-year con by submitting fake invoices for sign language interpreters to the Department of Work and Pensions through the Access to Work scheme. The money was then laundered through six sham companies set up in Canada, the United Arab Emirates and the UK to claim thousands every month in bogus fees. Shahab even used his connections at a local mosque and training college to recruit fraudsters to widen the scheme. Their ‘employees’ were given a cover story and paid hundreds of pounds a month for their ‘silence and co-operation’, the court heard. The couple’s lies about their financial circumstances also netted nearly £100,000 in benefits and tax exemptions from Harrow Council between 2002 and 2010. Prosecutor Rosina Cottage QC said: ‘The ease with which these frauds were perpetrated is scandalous; the extent of the Reza family’s greed and ability to lie is breathtakingly arrogant.’ She told jurors at Southwark Crown Court that the son and daughter were ‘drawn into the fraud very early’. A contract was found at the family home’s in Stanmore, north-west London, from 2008 that detailed an employment contract involving the brother and sister. Shehnaz Reza, 53, (left) and her children, Zainab, 22, (centre) and Abbas, 26, (right), denied involvement in the plot but Shehnaz and Abbas were found guilty of fraud charges. The jury could not reach a verdict on Zainab . The couple's son Abbas (pictured outside court) was found guilty of fraud charges at Southwark Crown Court . ‘The agreement was to employ [Zainab] for £400 a month – that is just a sham agreement,’ Miss Cottage said. ‘Shahab Reza knew he could trust his children to sign those documents and they would not ask any questions. 'We say that the young people – Abbas Reza and Zainab Reza – are intellectually able. 'Certainly we know that Abbas Reza is a fully trained and qualified doctor, Zainab Reza has a degree as well and they are no fools, however young they were when they first signed the documents. ‘The ease with which these frauds were perpetrated is scandalous; the extent of the Reza family’s greed and ability to lie is breathtakingly arrogant.' The court heard how the family laundered the cash through accounts in Canada, the United Arab Emirates and the UK and then spent on luxuries. The family bought property in Dubai, a new luxury family home and £600,000 penthouse apartment. Detectives later seized thousands of pounds worth of gold jewellery and gems in a safe at their house, as well as a £8,000 ‘flawless and beautiful’ diamond. The family also bought investment bonds and savings policies with the stolen funds. Abbas also splashed cash on a ‘student jolly’ to America in July 2009 and claimed back spending money and travel in expenses. Shehnaz regularly claimed business expenses while Zainab claimed her travel costs and Abbas was claiming for his mobile phone insurance. Zainab and her mother also claimed for travel and ‘everything they ate’ on a trip to Dubai to purchase an investment property. Shahab orchestrated the four-year con by submitting fake invoices for sign language interpreters to the Department of Work and Pensions through the Access to Work scheme. The accountant set up six sham companies to claim thousands a month in bogus fees on the basis of the fraudulent claim forms. But he had to widen the pool of people the cash was being paid to so Shahab used his connection with his mosque and the training college UCanDoIt to recruit further fraud members. Southward Crown Court heard how Shahab and his wife Shehnaz, who are both deaf, oversaw a four-year benefit swindle on the Department of Work and Pensions using false invoices for sign language interpreters . Shahab admitted his role in the con before the trial began and is facing years behind bars. The jury also found Shehnaz and Abbas guilty of fraud charges but were unable to reach verdicts in respect of Zainab. The jurors also failed to return verdicts on a string of further charges and were discharged from considering five counts after more than 60 hours of deliberation. The CPS has yet to indicate whether it will take the outstanding charges to a retrial. Sentencing has been adjourned until February. Daiva Alisaskaite, 42, from Hackney, east London, was their cleaner, while Natela Babina, from Middlesex, also attended meetings at the house. They were both found guilty of fraud by false representation and also await sentence. They were given a cover story and paid hundreds of pounds a month for their ‘silence and co-operation’, the court heard. Neither of them ever required an interpreter or support worker yet they submitted false claims worth hundreds of thousands of pounds. Among those cleared was friend Saifur Rahman, 31, from Camden Town, northwest London, who had been charged with fraud by false representation and showed palpable relief as the verdict was read. The jury failed to return a verdict for co-accused friend Ahsan Naseer, 29, from Birmingham, for the same charge. Rahman, Naseer, Babina and Alisauskaite admitted signing the bogus forms but said they ‘did not knew there was anything dishonest’ about it. Enquiries began after concerns were raised by Access to Work staff who investigated the fraud while the Reza family continued to make their bogus claims. Abbas, Shehnaz, and Zainab Reza, of, Stanmore, north west London, each denied conspiracy to defraud for which no verdict was reached. Shehnaz further denied a single count each of fraud by false representation, obtaining money transfer by deception, and dishonestly obtaining exemption from liability but was found guilty. Zainab denied a further charge of fraud by false representation for which no verdict was taken. Abbas denied but was convicted of one count of fraud by false representation but the jury was hung on a further charge of the same offence. The jury was discharged from considering a charge that Abbas lied about his finances to the Student Loans company.","Shahab Reza, 52, admitted scamming £900,000 from Government in scam .

"The female police chief due to take charge of Scotland Yard's Madeleine McCann probe arrived in Portugal today as former suspect Robert Murat prepares to be questioned as a witness. DCI Nicola Wall walked into Faro Police Station with outgoing Operation Grange boss Andy Redwood just before 9.30am for the start of the third day of interviews with nearly a dozen witnesses. She smiled at waiting reporters as she arrived but declined to say anything. Scroll down for video . Taking the reins: DCI Nicola Wall walked into Faro Police Station with outgoing Operation Grange boss Andy Redwood just before 9.30am for the start of the third day of interviews with nearly a dozen witnesses . Senior figures: DCIs Nicola Wall and Andy Redwood arrive at Faro's Police Station . British Detectives arrive at Faro's Police Station for Operation Grange . This week's quizzes - requested by Scotland Yard (detectives pictured) - are the first since four men were questioned as arguidos at the start of July. They all protested their innocence . John Hill, former manager of the Ocean Club holiday resort Madeleine vanished from and his wife Donna are among three people expected to be questioned as witnesses today. Mr Hill was alerted to Madeleine's May 3 2007 disappearance by a child care service manager. He went to apartment 5A where she had been sleeping shortly after she went missing and saw her parents Gerry and Kate 'in a panic and shouting the child had been taken'. He later arranged for photos of Madeleine, three when she disappeared, to be distributed. Detectives are expected to ask him about claims that a set of keys to Madeleine' s apartment went missing in the week she vanished. Facing questions: Former suspect Robert Murat (right) and his wife Michaela Walczuch (left) leave Faro's Police Station. Both have been summoned as witnesses in the McCann probe . British police believe Madeleine (pictured) was killed during a bungled burglary, a theory their Portuguese counterparts who are conducting their own parallel investigation into Madeleine's disappearance have privately rubbished . An unnamed Portuguese national is also due to be heard. Tomorrow former suspect Robert Murat, 41, will return to Faro Police Station to be quizzed over Madeleine McCann's disappearance. His German-born wife Michaela Walczuch, 38, was questioned yesterday as a witness but police ran out of time to interview British expat Mr Murat. The IT consultant was made a formal suspect or arguido days after Madeleine went missing before being cleared a year later. Mr Murat, one of 11 men and women due to be questioned as witnesses this week, has said he is happy to cooperate with police. This week's quizzes - requested by Scotland Yard - are the first since four men were questioned as arguidos at the start of July. They protested their innocence. British police believe Madeleine was killed during a bungled burglary, a theory their Portuguese counterparts who are conducting their own parallel investigation into Madeleine's disappearance have privately rubbished. Parts of the Praia da Luz resort where the youngster vanished were dug up in June at Scotland Yard's request in a grim search for her body - but failed to yield any clues. DCI Wall, from the Met Police's Homicide and Major Crime Command Unit, will take charge of the British police investigation into Madeleine's disappearance from Andy Redwood on December 22 when he retires. Vanished: Madeleine McCann was three years old when she disappeared from her holiday resort in Praia da Luz (pictured) in May 2007 . She has been with the Met Police for 26 years, nine as a DCI, and is married to a man who does contract work in the Middle East. She oversaw the investigation into the murder of Tia Sharp, whose body was found in the loft of her grandmother's house in New Addington, south London, days after she went missing in August 2012. Stuart Hazell, a former boyfriend of Tia's mum, was jailed for life at the Old Bailey in May last year after dramatically admitting murdering the youngster during his trial. DCI Wall told Vogue in an interview published in April last year: 'No two jobs are the same. 'We could end up with the Tia Sharp jobs of this world. And then there are jobs that are equally as difficult as those, but that just somehow don't get that media spark.' She attributed her low media profile in the magazine interview to the fact 'we solve cases so quickly nobody gets involved'. Speaking of her marriage and personal life, she added: 'We don't have children. 'I have the greatest respect for women who balance both - because that's fantastic - but I don't have to. 'And I've got a house in Putney, and I have a really nice life.' She also admitted to being a fan of TV policewoman Saga Noren, star of Scandinavian crime thriller The Bridge 'because she's quite feminine, very glamorous, very pretty and very capable, too'.","DCI Nicola Wall walked into Faro Police Station on third day of interviews .

"A Latvian model plunged to her death from a hotel apartment after her ex-boyfriend told her family she was working as an escort girl, an inquest heard. Laura Pahomova, 23, sent a final text to her father, who believed she was studying at university, saying: 'You deserve a better daughter' before climbing over a balcony at the Light Boutique Aparthotel in Manchester city centre. Her family back home had been told of her activities by a one-time client and on-off ex-boyfriend, Martin Riley, Manchester Coroner's Court heard.

Inside the apartment where she had been staying she had written on mirrors, walls and furniture in lipstick and ink, blaming Mr Riley and apologising to her family, the inquest heard. She had also sent a series of heartbreaking text messages to each member of her family which read: 'Please forgive me, I love you very much... I lost my mind. 'At the moment you can't do anything, I made too many mistakes but you are going to be OK I promise you. 'I was afraid but I'm not anymore. It's only my fault. Nothing can save my soul or my body.

Mr Riley was initially arrested as a suspect after Miss Pahomova's death but no charges were brought against him as there was 'insufficient evidence' for a prosecution. But the court heard he had been convicted of harassment before when in 'completely similar circumstances' he again met an escort girl, began a relationship, then threatened, and did, contact her family telling them what she was doing. Nigel Meadows, coroner for Manchester, had issued a summons for Mr Riley to attend the inquest. But despite employing private investigators to track him down the coroner has been unable to serve the summons - and the inquest went ahead without him present. His mother, Janet Riley, when visited at the family home on Cobble Bank, Blackley, Manchester, was 'very reluctant' to discuss his whereabouts other than to say he was out of the country, the court heard. Miss Pahomova first came to the UK in 2008, working in a factory in Blackburn where she lived for a time and also working as a part-time model. In 2011 she met Mr Riley as an escort and they began an 'on-off' relationship. The tragedy unfolded at the Light Boutique Aparthotel (pictured left and right) in Manchester city centre . Her family back home had been told of her activities by a one-time client and on-off ex-boyfriend, Martin Riley, Manchester Coroner's Court heard . After a trip home she returned to the UK on September 24, 2012, six days before her death, telling family she was returning to her studies. The next day Mr Riley arranged through an escort website to meet Miss Pahomova - but used a false name and when they met she was 'shocked and distressed' and told him to leave. Two days later she went into the aparthotel, specified she wanted an 'elevated position' and booked into a room. The same day her family received an email from Mr Riley telling them she was not a student but working as an escort - and providing website details of 'how her services could be obtained'. Her father Janis Vienters, who followed proceedings in court through a translator, was left 'very shocked and surprised' and wanted to bring her home. Two days later, the day before Miss Pahomova died, her family received a second email from Mr Riley, saying that she now knew they were aware of her lifestyle. Inside the apartment where she had been staying Ms Pahomova (pictured) had written on mirrors, walls and furniture in lipstick and ink, blaming Mr Riley and apologising to her family, the inquest heard . Miss Pahomova (pictured left and right) was alone at the time of her death and did not have drugs or alcohol in her body . After a trip home she returned to the UK on September 24, 2012, six days before her death, telling family she was returning to her studies . They then received the text messages from their daughter. Around 11.30am the next day Miss Pahomova climbed over the balcony on her apartment. No drugs or alcohol were present in her body. Mr Vienters had tried to contact his daughter and said he would buy her tickets to get her home after receiving the text messages. But the next information he received was that she had been found dead. Although Mr Riley had visited the apartment, she was alone at the time of her death. Her friend, Vera Novikova, told the inquest she was aware Miss Pahomova was working as a 'posh prostitute' or escort and she had described Mr Riley as a 'stalker'. Det Sgt Cheryll Morrell, of Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said Mr Riley told police Miss Pahomova was 'fragile' and he was worried about what she might do so he told the family about her life so they could support her and get her to return home to Latvia. Her friend, Vera Novikova, told the inquest she was aware Miss Pahomova (pictured) was working as a 'posh prostitute' or escort and she had described Mr Riley as a 'stalker' Nigel Meadows, coroner for Manchester, ruled Miss Pahomova (pictured) took her own life . Mr Meadows said it was a 'little contradictory' asking the officer: 'He knew she was threatening suicide if they found out? But nevertheless, he told them?' Det Sgt Morrell replied: 'Yes. Yes, it did not ring true.' Mr Meadows ruled Miss Pahomova took her own life. He added: 'For reasons only Mr Riley will know and understand he decided to contact Mr Vienters and the family to make disclosures about Laura's lifestyle, when she clearly had not wished him to do that. She was obviously distressed and upset. 'It seems from what Mr Riley told police she was in a very distressed and fragile state and threatened to kill herself. 'Despite that, Mr Riley did not contact anyone to raise concerns about Laura's welfare. 'The court does not deal with moral responsibility, those have to remain within the consciences of those involved.'","Laura Pahomova, 23, fell to her death at the Light Boutique Aparthotel in Manchester .

"A baby girl has been born in the West Bank after her father’s sperm was smuggled out of an Israeli prison. Baby Yasmeen was conceived through artificial insemination and born on Wednesday at a hospital in the West Bank City of Nablus. Proud mother Samira Nimr smiled as she held her newborn baby, but the father could only be present in a picture above the hospital bed. Baby joy: Samira Nimr holds her child Yasmeen at a hospital in the West Bank City of Nablus . Palestinian Yahya Nimr is currently serving a life sentence in an Israeli prison and is not allowed conjugal visits. This is not the first time Palestinian babies have been born to men locked in Israeli jails, with at least three similar cases being reported in the past three years. In 2012, Dallal Ziben, 32, gave birth to baby Muhannad after being artificially inseminated by 37-year-old husband Ammar, a Hamas activist who is currently serving 32 life sentences in an Israeli prison. Palestinians are not permitted to receive conjugal visits, and although Mrs Ziben had not set eyes on her husband for 15 years, Ammar’s sperm was smuggled out of Hadarim prison in central Israel.

New life: A Palestinian doctor feeds baby Yasmeen at a hospital in the West Bank City of Nablus today . Details of how the sperm is smuggled out of the prisons is kept a closely guarded secret. A spokesman for the Israel Prisons Service said she was not aware of the pregnancy, and that security prisoners were not allowed conjugal visits, with the Palestinian Prisoners' Club confirming the same information. 'Visits by prisoners' wives are closely supervised by prison guards and there is no way a prisoner could get time alone with his wife,' the Nablus-based spokesman said in 2012 . In the past, fertility clinics in Nablus have been known to carry out artificial inseminations for Palestinian couples where the husband is imprisoned.","Samira Nimr gave birth to baby girl while husband is in Israeli prison .

"A Mexican teenager has been charged with murdering his 17-year-old girlfriend and stuffing her body in a wardrobe after she found out he was seeing another woman. Student Yael Eduardo Espinosa Guerrero, 19, appealed for help finding his girlfriend Silvia Paredes Moedano after she went missing last week and even comforted her parents. But in reality Miss Moedano's body was hidden in Guerrero's bedroom after he allegedly strangled her to death when she told him their relationship was over. The body of Silvia Paredes Moedano, 17, was found hidden in her boyfriend's wardrobe days after she found out he was seeing another girl . Miss Moedano went to his home in Tultitlan, north of Mexico City, after she found out he was seeing another woman - Elia Carbajal Becerril, 22. It is then alleged that Guerrero throttled the 17-year-old to death and hid her body in his wardrobe. He is also said to have called Becerill for help hiding the body, which lay in the bottom of his closet for three days before it was found by police. After Miss Moedano went missing last Thursday, Guerrero told local newspapers: 'Wherever you are Silvia there are people here that miss you, please let us know you are alive and well.' Guerrero, 19, appealed for help finding his girlfriend Miss Moedano (pictured) for three days before her body was found in his bedroom . On Sunday, police officers interviewed Guerrero's parents to ask if knew where Miss Moedano might be, or if they had seen her before she disappeared. During the interview, an officer spotted the girl's handbag in the student's bedroom. It was then that they made the grim discovery of Miss Moedano's lifeless body in her boyfriend's wardrobe. Police spokesman Macabeo Garcia said: 'The handbag was found with blood stains on it and when they went to question the man when he arrived home, he ran off. 'When he was finally arrested he tried to pay officers cash to let him go again.' Guerrero was arrested and charged with murder as well as bribery. A post-mortem examination found that Miss Moedano died from strangulation after a violent attack. Becerril was also arrested for her involvement in the murder. Mr Garcia added: 'We are currently looking at the level of her involvement and in the meantime both are being held in custody.'","Yael Eduardo Espinosa Guerrero is accused of murdering his girlfriend .

"Dangling like spiders 250ft above craggy rocks, this team of daredevil gardeners need a strong head for heights to keep the nooks and crannies of this medieval castle free of unwanted greenery. As part of the work to conserve St Michael's Mount, just off the south Cornwall coast, this 'extreme weeding' takes place three times each year to ensure the walls are constantly kept clear. The only way the four-strong team of gardeners can carry out their work is to abseil down the 50m high castle walls, located on an island 300m from the mainland. Head Gardener, Lottie Allen, said: 'It is a thrilling and unique experience to tend these gardens which are designed to be viewed from above. On a personal note, abseiling allows me to appreciate the spectacular views of our gardens across the seasons and in all weathers. Scroll down for video . A team of four gardeners abseil down the 250ft cliff face at St Michael's Mount off the coast of Cornwall to weed the plants . The 'extreme weeding' takes place three times each year at the 12th Century castle to ensure the walls are constantly kept clear . 'We weed these areas three times a year not only to ensure the stonework remains intact and strong but also to allow the succulents planted within the walls, such as aloes and aeoniums, to thrive and flourish. 'Abseiling has become an important skill to complete essential strimming and planting of the many nooks and crannies within the cliff face where plants grow in spite of the salty winter storms and the baking summer temperatures. It is one of only three places where 'extreme' weeding takes place, the others being Bodiam Castle in East Sussex and Scotney Castle in Kent. In January, the team will be planting an area above the East Terraces with succulent plants such as Agaves and Aeoniums, daisy-like Osteospermum and Agapanthus.

"A 19-year-old who has suffered from a recurring brain tumour for five years is desperately trying to raise $120,000 so he can fly to the U.S. and receive treatment not available in Australia. Casper McCallum, from Parkwood on the Gold Coast, was first diagnosed with the tumour when he was 14 and has since had four operations to reduce its size, undergone months of chemotherapy and suffered a stroke. The family have run out of options in Australia and with the tumour starting to grow close to Casper's brain stem their only hope is to fly him to the U.S. before February for expensive proton therapy which has a 95 percent chance of working. His mother Louise McCallum, 51, says he has no chance of surviving without the treatment. Neighbours visit Casper McCallum (second from left) after his most recent operation in September . The 19-year-old has suffered from a recurring brain tumour which was first discovered when he was 14 . 'There's nothing they can do here apart from stopping the tumour growing as fast, but they can't even say that will work,' Ms McCallum told Daily Mail Australia. 'The proton therapy has a 95 per cent chance of working, which you know is still not 100 per cent but it's a better shot than what we've got here. 'I spoke to the doctor [in the U.S.] and he said they've had enormous success, particularly in young adults.' The type of treatment available in Australia – photon radiation - is very invasive and dangerous, Ms McCallum said. 'It damages every single tissue that it touches,' she said. 'It would obviously damage his brain, but we don't know what part. 'But with proton radiation [in the U.S.] a pencil beam can go through at a very slow rate and the beam can also come out the same way it came in, so it reduces the damage of healthy tissue.' The Gold Coast teen (pictured before and after his first operation) has suffered weight gain and a stroke . Casper is fitted with a mask before he receives radiation treatment in hospital in Australia . The medical equipment for proton therapy, which costs $200 million and takes two years to build, has not yet been brought to Australia. The government has subsidised patients to travel overseas for similar treatments in the past, but the application process for funding would take too long so the family are trying to raise the $120,000 themselves. Casper's tumour is not cancerous but it keeps growing back and the side effects from numerous operations and bouts of chemotherapy to reduce its size have meant Casper has not been able to life a normal teenage life. 'It's been a whole lifestyle change,' he said. 'I guess I used to be just normal and then it was just really overwhelming, I gained a lot of weight and I felt tired all the time.' The last operation Casper had in September caused a stroke, affecting his vision and movement in his left side which means the avid drummer can no longer play in his band. He graduated from high school but was unable to attend for long periods of time and his vision is impaired so he can't drive. The medical equipment for proton therapy, which costs $200 million and takes two years to build, has not yet been brought to Australia . His mother Louise McCallum (pictured left) says he has no chance of surviving without the treatment. Casper pictured with a friend at the beach earlier this month . 'I think he lost a lot of confidence, he was a very outgoing child,' Ms McCallum said. 'He'd love to work but it's hard finding a job, he is always tired because of the drugs.' Like his peers, Casper has career aspirations – in Casper's case his dream is to work in the film industry – but he had to drop out of a TAFE course earlier this year due to his illness. 'It's been a roller-coaster ride - you feel you go one step forward and then three steps back,' Ms McCallum said. 'He has short-term memory loss from previous operations. 'In the past he's been in a lot of agony, or has suffered constant vomiting whether it be from the chemo or the pressure on the brain. Like his peers Casper has career aspirations – in Casper's case his dream is to work in the film industry – but he had to drop out of a TAFE course earlier this year due to his illness . Casper had to miss long periods of school but was able to graduate and attend his Year 12 formal (pictured) 'You sort of wake up and have to take every day as it comes.' Three weeks ago the family's neighbours came together to form a committee to help fundraise for the 19-year-old, because the sooner he can receive treatment the more chance doctors have of successfully removing the tumour. If they reach their goal of $120,000 Casper would need to go to the clinic in the U.S. and he would undergo intensive treatment every day for six weeks. The committee have held sausage sizzles, local businesses have put tins at their counters and they have a street garage sale and concert planned for later this year. A Facebook page and crowdfunding page have also been set up for donations and so far $37,490 has been raised. 'It's pretty overwhelming, it's put a massive smile on my face,' Casper said.","Casper McCallum was first diagnosed with a tumour when he was 14 .

"A new landmark report has revealed that the vow of celibacy taken by Catholic priests and clergy may have been the contributing factor for the years of child sex abuse within the church. Issued by the Australian church's Truth, Justice and Healing Council the report states that 'obligatory celibacy' may have caused priests to abuse thousands of children and that priests should have 'psycho-sexual development' training. The council's chief executive Francis Sullivan told The Australian that the church must now examine 'how individuals who have chosen to be celibate, can remain healthy and not begin acting out of a dysfunctional sense of self'. A new report states that 'obligatory celibacy' may have caused priests to abuse thousands of children . 'We've got to ask the question whether celibacy was an added and an unbearable strain for some,' he said. 'It doesn't mean that celibacy has to be eradicated - let's not turn the church on its head - but we are saying you can't have honest and open discussion about the future without an honest and open discussion about celibacy. We are placing celibacy on the table.' Catholicism is the principal religion in Australia. It is unique among the mainstream Christian churches in that priests and religious leaders must all take a vow of celibacy, and they must renounce sex entirely. The Catholic Church has for decades been rife with child sex abuse cases . The report identifies a culture of 'obedience and closed environments', as well as how potential candidates for the clergy were picked. it stated that this potentially played a role 'in the prevalence of abuse within some orders and dioceses'. The Australian church's Truth, Justice and Healing Council's supervisory group includes the archbishops of Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Canberra and Adelaide, it's findings are in stark contrast to a recent US study that said that celibacy should not be blamed for the abuse. It was a radical departure from findings of the five-year 'The Causes and Context of Sexual Abuse of Minors by Catholics Priests in The United States, 1950-2010', reported The Australian. Celibacy may have been 'an added and an unbearable strain' for some priests and lead them to abusing children . This report was presented to the US Conference of Catholic Bishops in 2011. 'It is not clear why the commitment to or state of celibate chastity should be seen as a cause for the steady rise in incidence of sexual abuse,' the report said. A recent US study however, said that celibacy should not be blamed for child abuse .","Truth, Justice and Healing Council report states that 'obligatory celibacy' may have caused priests to abuse thousands of children .

"They are 'Anni's army' - more than 150 pupils at a remote Indian school who now have two new classrooms thanks to funds donated in memory of murdered honeymoon bride Anni Dewani. As her family struggles to come to terms with not knowing exactly how she died, they can at least take comfort that something positive has come from her passing. The Anudanit Ashram school in Guhi, 135km from Nasik in the state of Maharashtra, western India, has a whole new building in Anni's honour – though pupils and teachers have no idea who she actually was. Anni's army: Students at the school come from mainly tribal and rural families . Smiling pupils at the Anudanit Ashram school  are delighted to have two new classrooms . Smiling for Anni: Pupils love having extra space to learn, but have no idea about the woman in whose memory their new building was constructed . Her husband Shrien Dewani, accused of ordering her killing in South Africa four years ago, returned to Britain yesterday after being allowed to walk free without giving evidence when his trial in Cape Town collapsed on Monday in a case which gripped the world. But to the 150 students at Anudanit Ashram, hers is just a name on a plaque which adorns their new school building. The families of both Anni and Shrien contributed funds to UK charity Sewa, which raised £15,394 in total to construct the extension, . Around £12,000 of that came from millionaire businessman Shrien Dewani’s family, who donated it to Wanvasi Kalyan Ashram, an NGO in India which runs the Anudanit Ashram school. The school’s headteacher, Ishwar Lal, 46, said pupils and teachers were very grateful for the new building, but have no idea why there is a plaque with Anni's name on it. 'After repeated inquiries from teachers and curious students, I asked the NGO that helped us build the classes about Anni Dewani, but I was only told she was a social activist in the UK,' said Mr Lal, who also teaches English. The £15,000 building has two classrooms to help the school cope with 150 pupils from 50 different villages . The plaque in Anni's memory on the new extension, housing two classrooms to take the school's total to seven . Anni Dewani was murdered by two gunmen after being dragged from a taxi in a Cape Town township in 2010 . The school, which takes children with predominantly tribal and rural backgrounds from 50 nearby villages, was established 28 years ago and used to have just five classrooms. But with the extension, it now has seven and much more room for lessons. The building was completed in October last year but Wanvasi Kalyan Ashram is still clueless as to who Mrs Dewani was and has no idea of her horrific killing at the hands of two gunmen in the Gugulethu township of Cape Town in November 2010. Sanjay Kulkarni, 46, organisation secretary of the NGO, said: ‘Whoever this Anni Dewani is we want to thank her for what she's done for us. 'These classrooms make it possible for these children to learn and without this school they'd have no education because the nearest town is so far away. 'Mrs Dewani has helped us to build a better school and accommodate more pupils and we cannot thank her enough for that.' Space is tight for pupils, but has been expanded greatly by the two new classrooms in Anni's memory . A lesson in progress at headteacher Ishwar Lal's school, who was told Anni Dewani was a 'socialist activist' Anudanit Ashram school needs three more classrooms according to Sanjay Kulkarni, organisation secretary of the NGO which helps support it . Guhi is a remote village 135km from Nasik in the state of Maharashtra, western India . Mr Kulkarni said the school now needs three more classrooms, so that every year will have a proper classroom, and is hoping to get more funds. Anni Dewani's mother spoke exclusively to MailOnline yesterday for the first time since her son-in-law was dramatically cleared of her daughter's murder, calling him a 'coward'. Devastated Nilam Hindocha said Dewani had been as pathetic for applying to get his charges dismissed as he had been on the night he abandoned Anni with two gunmen on the night she was shot dead. 'He didn't have the guts to face us. He was a coward in the court, always a coward,' she said, just after watching Dewani's 'VIP' arrival back in Britain on television. Nilam Hindocha embracing her daughter Anni Dewani at home in Sweden in 2011 after her wedding to Shrien Dewani in Mumbai. It is the last picture the family have of Anni alive . Shrien Dewani and brother Preyen are whisked away from Gatwick Airport yesterday morning . She spoke after an 'elated and relaxed' Shrien Dewani flew back into Gatwick today on a £3,000 flight - and was rushed through the airport by police and airport security. Mrs Hindocha is preparing to leave South Africa after spending more than two months waiting for her son-in-law to give evidence at his trial about the night her daughter Anni was killed. Speaking two days after the judge threw out all charges against the 34-year-old bisexual, the mother-of-three said she was still haunted about him leaving Anni alone with her killers. 'I don't think any other men would leave their wives like that. If he really loved her he would have fought for her. 'I didn't see any marks on him, there was no sign that he had put up any fight for her. He had thought only about himself. 'I asked him why he seemed so normal, so unhurt, there was nothing wrong with him. I kept asking him about that, why he had got away without injuries, but he never answered me. 'I kept asking why he left Anni all alone with those men. How could he have just left her with them and he was freed and not even hurt?'","More than £15,000 was raised by Shrien and Anni Dewani's families .

"A disgraced accountant who was given a second chance as a church treasurer after he claimed to have 'found God' has been jailed after stealing £30,000 from parish funds. David Barras, 61, was appointed treasurer at St Christopher's Church and St James Church in Bradford, West Yorkshire - despite having been jailed for 12 months in 1992 for stealing £10,000 from the Citizens Advice Bureau. Members of the Tong and Holme Wood Parochial Church Council decided to give him a second chance because he was a Christian and had been a member of the congregation for eight years. David and Wendy Barras at Bradford Crown Court.  Mr Barras, who was given a second chance as a church treasurer after he claimed to have 'found God', has been jailed after stealing £30,000 from parish funds . But after he was appointed thousands soon began to go missing from the church coffers. A court heard Barras took a £10,000 bequest from a former church organist and  scores of donations from parishioners where two thirds of congregation earned the minimum wage. The qualified chartered accountant, a father-of-three,  then spent some of the stolen money on a car. Barrat's deceit was exposed when he was confronted by vicar Rev Steve Davie after his predecessor found a parish bank statement with large cash withdrawals showing on it. Barras initially claimed he had 'borrowed' the money but it emerged up to 83 illicit transactions had taken place. He later said started taking small amounts from the church account as 'a temporary loan' but the amounts increased and, in May alone, he pocketed £8,300. At the time Barras lived on benefits. Bradford Crown Court was told the stolen money was badly needed by a struggling parish that ran at an annual deficit of up to £8,000. In an area where two thirds of the 179 parishioners had incomes of under £10,000 a year,  Rev Davie said people saw the church as a trusted refuge, and that trust was now compromised by the thefts. A court heard Barras took a £10,000 bequest from a former church organist and scores of donations from parishioners where two thirds of congregation earned the minimum wage. His wife Wendy, 49, pleaded guilty to fraud by false representation after she transferred £500 from the church group's bank account . Barras who has diabetes and mobility problems pleaded guilty to theft and was jailed for two years and ordered to pay a £100 victim surcharge. He said he 'spiralled into debt' after his previous conviction left him unable to work as a chartered accountant. His wife Wendy, 49, pleaded guilty to fraud by false representation after she transferred £500 from the church group's bank account to the personal account of her husband at a time when he was in hospital. She was conditionally discharged for 12 months and was ordered to pay a £15 victim surcharge. Bradford Crown Court was told the stolen money was badly needed by a struggling parish that ran at an annual deficit of up to £8,000. Pictured is St Christopher's Church . Passing sentence Judge Peter Benson said: 'This church is in a community that is deprived and has a high crime rate. 'People turn to the church feeling that they can mix with people they can trust and it was a refuge from the harsh realities of life in the immediate area. You breached the trust of parishioners, who had made sacrifices to give money to the church.' After the case, the Rev Davie who campaigns against payday loan companes said: I was very pleased about what the judge said about finding the victim impact statement very moving and I was pleased that I was able to express, on behalf of the churches, the impact of the breakdown of trust that I am sure can be rebuilt. 'We are very sorry that this has all come about and sorry for Mr Barras's family, who knew nothing about this.' Barras' son Jonathan Barras, 25, said: 'He brought all this on himself. 'We can't support him after what he's done. He duped mum into it and she has to be our priority now, making sure she will be okay. 'Dad betrayed the church and us - he has no excuse.'","David Barras, 61, was appointed treasurer at church in Bradford .

"These are the shocking injuries suffered by a woman who was beaten by her husband after they were captured on a police body camera worn by a officer responding to her 999 call. Police were called to Dawn Marmoy's home on the Isle of Wight in October last year after reports she was being attacked by her husband Michael Gregory. The two responding officers were both wearing Body-Worn Video (BWV) cameras, which filmed Ms Marmoy's bruised and swollen face, which one officer described as the worst they had ever seen. The images captured on a police officer's body worn video camera showing the shocking injuries suffered by Dawn Marmoy after she was beaten by her husband Michael Gregory . The pictures show Ms Marmoy after she was attacked and when police came to her home in the Isle of Wight after she dialled 999 . Ms Marmoy's face was left bruised and swollen following the attack and the footage shows how she was left in pain . In the footage, which has been released by Hampshire Police, the two officers can be seen knocking on the front door, which is opened by Gregory. As a dog barks loudly in the background, one of the officers ask Gregory if they can speak to his wife. At first the 77-year-old is reluctant to let them in, saying 'who called you?' But after eventually letting the officers into the home, the footage then shows a confused Ms Marmoy, aged 60, who has bruising around both eyes and swollen cheeks. She can then be seen sitting in an armchair holding a cup wincing in pain from her injuries. Gregory was then arrested and in May of this year pleaded guilty to assault and jailed at Portsmouth Crown Court. Now the footage showing the night of the attack has been released with the consent of Ms Marmoy, who is urging other sufferers of domestic violence to speak up. When officers first turned up at the couple's house in the Isle of Wight, Gregory answered the door and at first appeared reluctant to let the constables inside . Gregory eventually relented, and the officers discovered Ms Marmoy and her injuries. Gregory has since been convicted of assault at Portsmouth Crown Court . She said: 'You’ve got a life, and you deserve that life. These people make you feel worthless, completely useless; that’s not true. 'They deserve the punishment, you don’t, but until you tell someone, or say it’s ""got to stop"", it will carry on. Do what you’ve got to do, but do it sooner than I did it. 'The last time he was punching me, I thought ""this is it"", you’re going to die tonight. 'I was thinking of my children, my grandchildren. He just meant to do me harm, which he did, but I didn’t realise how much harm, I was terrified. 'They could see the emotion of how frightened I was. If they (police) had left that night and that camera wasn’t on, and it had been a little bit later, they wouldn’t have found me as they did, they would have found a body.' She also appeared on the BBC Panorama programme earlier this week, where she spoke about her experiences. Police are now praising Ms Marmoy for speaking about her injuries and say the case highlights how usefel BWV cameras can be. Ms Marmoy pictured now, has allowed Hampshire Police to release the footage of the night she was attacked in a bid to urge other survivors of domestic abuse to speak out . Detective Superintendent Ben Snuggs said: 'The effects of domestic abuse can be profound and persistent for the survivors, their families and the wider community. 'We have the utmost respect and admiration for Dawn Marmoy and her decision to speak out and give strength to encourage other victims not to suffer in silence. 'Hampshire Constabulary is dedicated to supporting survivors like Dawn to ensure they have trust and confidence in reporting their experiences to police. 'This case provides a graphic insight into the power of Body-Worn Video (BWV) as an independent witness that captures crucial early evidence in an investigation.'","Dawn Marmoy called 999 after she was beaten by Michael Gregory .

"She was working full-time in a demanding job while raising her two young boys on her own, but that didn't stop Sophie Guidolin from transforming her life. Five years ago and 28 kilograms heavier than she is now, Sophie was unhealthy and exhausted, and had never stepped foot in a gym in her life. Eating a lot of processed food while trying to maintain her energy and a balance in her life, the busy mum decided something had to give. 'I was never overweight before I had the boys, (but) when I was pregnant I put on 28 kilos, and that's when I really realised I needed to make a change,' the 25-year-old told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Sophia Guidolin, 25, lost almost 30 kilograms after the birth of her two young sons, while working full-time and bring up the boys on her own . Sophie (right before her transformation) is now 28 kilograms lighter and works as a fitness model (right), plus has written two books . The mum of two started exercising by simply going for a run while pushing her two boys in their pram . Sophie started with cardio exercise first, and would take her sons out in the pram for a jog. Then once the weight started to shift she would get up at 4am in the morning and work out at home before heading off to a full day at her job. She used anything she would get her hands on in the house to train with, and soon the results really started to show. 'I would use stairs at the house, do step ups on chairs, fill water bottles up and use them as weights', Sophie revealed. 'I would try and utilise anything I could.' About 18 months after she first decided to get healthy, Sophie signed up the gym for the first time in her life. 'I had never really been into a gym before I had my kids, I had never stepped into a gym.' While training one day she was approached by a coach who offered to sponsor her so she could compete in a bodybuilding competition. When Sophie said she didn't think it was for her, he gave her another option. 'He said ""okay, I'll train you for six months and if you don't want to hop on stage you don't have to"". 'But by the time six months came around I was so confident, I hopped on stage and I won, then I went on to nationals and I won nationals,' Sophie said. Her most recent title is from the Arnold Classic held in Ohio- one of the most prestigious competitions worldwide - where Sophie placed fifth overall. 'Competing was never really my goal, it sort of just fell into my lap,' she revealed. Sophie said bodybuilding 'sort of fell into my lap' but despite this she won the first competition she  entered . In March the mum-of-two placed fifth in the Arnold Classic held in Ohio - one of the world's most prestigious competitions . After she had built up some cardio endurance, Sophie would get up at 4am to work out before heading to an eight hour day at her job . Although Sophie acknowledged that exercise was crucial to her transformation, she said there's nothing better in the world you can do for yourself than 'eat clean'. 'When I started implementing the nutrition changes that's when the weight really dropped off.' For the most part, Sophie's family consumes only food they have made themselves, the bulk of which is prepared twice a week - on a Sundays and Wednesdays. Her kids - now six and seven - help make and pack their own school lunches, and Sophie said she likes the keep them involved in the whole process. 'We go to the markets, we get what they want and they're there form the beginning,' she said. 'Rye bread wraps with chicken or lamb and salad they'll make that themselves.' Sweet potato chips and homemade roll-ups made in a dehydrator also pop up in the kids' lunchboxes, as well as banana bread and blueberry muffins. But this has caused some clashes in the past, and one particular confrontation with her eldest son's first pre-school comes to mind for Sophie. 'My eldest son had started kindergarten and I sent him to school with some healthier options, but when I picked him up I had a little fine for a $6 lunch voucher because they had to give him lunch.' 'He had quinoa bread and banana bread... They said to me that unfortunately it doesn't meet their nutritional needs and he couldn’t eat it,' Sophia said. Getting the kids involved is also a great way to keep them occupied while you work out . The mum-of-two said while she was never overweight, she felt slow and her energy levels were nowhere near where they are today . Getting the whole family involved is a great way to get active and outdoors, like taking a bike ride or going for a hike Sophie said . Homemade blueberry muffins was also off the cards according to the school, who told her the nutritional requirements were that children bring a sandwich with a spread, e.g. Vegemite, honey, or jam. Sophie was also accused of sending her son to school with nuts, despite quinoa being a grain. 'I pulled them out of that kindy, for obvious reasons', she laughed. One a more serious note she added: 'I think that they need to put more guidelines in place including options that mums can send in to schools that are nutritious.' With one book already under her belt, Eat Clean Live Lean, and another due for release this month, My Kids Eat, Sophie said the key to maintaining a balanced and healthy lifestyle comes down to preparation. 'Buy everything in bulk, there's quite a few health food stores where you can buy kilos of things especially things like dates. 'Always buy in season, that's so important. 'And everyone always says they're too scared to buy my cookbooks because they think they need special equipment. The only thing that I recommend is a good food processor,' Sophie said. Some of her other top tips for busy mums included not doing the groceries hungry, always buy fresh produce in season, and ditching the coffee dates for the beach instead. 'Instead of catching up for coffee or dinner I try and catch up with friends by going to beach, walk, bike, hike. Don't base your social life around food,' Sophie said. She acknowledged that exercise was crucial to her transformation, she said there's nothing better in the world you can do for yourself than 'eat clean' The mum said preparation and organisation is the key to leading a successful healthy lifestyle . Sophie and her husband - also a champion bodybuilder - now run a gym and coaching busines . Now working as a coach herself at her husband's gym, the busy mum said she has no plans to return to competition just yet. 'I just have so many beautiful girls I'm training at the moment and I don't want to do that to them,' Sophie laughed. She stressed to all the busy mums - and others -out there, you certainly don't need a gym membership to lead an active lifestyle. Sophie still trains at home when she needs to, and even incorporates her kids during school holidays. 'We have 15 litre water container bottles and I will hold that and do lunges, squats, sit ups, anything,' she revealed. 'I will even use my boys as weights,' Sophia said. '(Plus) lot of my exercise now is fun-based, they're (her kids) at the age now where we go for bike rides, go for a surf, the boys like to kick a foot around at the part, that sort of thing.","Sophie Guidolin, 25, put on 28 kilograms during her two pregnancies .

"Tristen Kurilla, the 10-year-old boy who's been in an adult jail since authorities say he fatally beat 90-year-old Helen Novak two months ago is scared, lonely and misses his mother, his public defender said. Kurilla, one of the youngest ever to face an adult homicide charge in Pennsylvania, met with family through a glass partition when he was first brought to the county lockup in rural northeastern Pennsylvania. More recently, he was permitted to have physical contact with them, according to the attorney, Scott Bennett. 'So his mom can give him a hug,' he said this week of the meeting between Martha Virbitsky and her son. Scroll Down for Video . 'Pint-size killer': Tristen Kurilla, 10, pictured left and right with his mother, has been charged as an adult in the death of 90-year-old Helen Novak, whom he allegedly hooked by the neck with her cane . The beating occurred October 11 at the home of the boy's grandfather, who had been caring for the victim, Helen Novak. Kurilla became angered when he went into Novak's room to ask her a question and she yelled at him, according to the boy's mother, who brought him to a state police barracks later that day. Killed: Tristen Kurilla admitted to police that he beat 90-year-old Helen Novak to death in October . According Virbitsky, her son told her that 'he got mad, lost his temper and grabbed a cane and put it around Novak's throat,' police said. The 10-year-old told a trooper he punched her several times in the throat and stomach while holding her down on the bed, authorities have said. Kurilla has since met with a psychiatrist retained by the attorney general's office. The defense intends to have him see its own mental health expert, and Bennett said he will seek a transfer to juvenile court. He wants the boy treated in a youth facility. 'He's doing as well as can be expected. He's a 10-year-old kid away from his family. This is not an easy thing,' Bennett said. Currently Kurilla is housed away from the adult population, but he's not in solitary confinement, according to the jail outside Honesdale. His cell doors are opened in the morning and locked at night, like the other inmates. He is supplied with books and movies, and a certified teacher helps him keep up with his schooling, said Vicky Botjer, chief clerk of Wayne County. 'The Wayne County Correctional Facility is housing the defendant in a safe environment,' she said via email. Temper tantrum: The 10-year-old (center) reportedly told police he flew off the handle when Novak, who has been in the care of his grandfather, yelled at him to get out of her room . Confession: The boy allegedly told police he 'killed that lady,' even though he was only 'trying to hurt her' An attorney who initially represented the boy had petitioned to have him released into the custody of his father or moved to a juvenile detention facility. But he withdrew his request, saying the family wasn't comfortable having him placed in their care, and the closest youth facility was 80 miles away. So the child has remained in the adult jail. Marsha Levick, chief counsel of the Juvenile Law Center in Philadelphia, questioned what she viewed as a lack of urgency in the case. Even if the boy is being treated well, an adult lockup simply isn't equipped to meet a child's needs, she said. 'It's shocking. I'm not sure there's another state in the country where we would see this, a 10-year-old boy sitting in an adult county jail for two months,' she said. 'This is not in any way to diminish the crime he is charged with, which is the most serious crime, but we don't treat children in this country this way.' A spokesman for the Pennsylvania attorney general's office, which is prosecuting the boy, declined to comment. Police said an autopsy performed Monday at Wayne Memorial Hospital in Honesdale indicated blunt force trauma to the victim's neck, and the death was ruled a homicide. Dr. Gary Ross also said the boy's account to police 'was consistent with the injuries he observed.' Tristen was charged as an adult with criminal homicide and aggravated assault, with the prosecutor's office noting that the crime of homicide 'is specifically excluded from the juvenile act' and therefore 'a juvenile who commits the crime of homicide is charged as an adult.' Anthony Virbitsky, 69, Tristen’s grandfather who has been looking after Ms Novak, went into her room at around 10.30am and found her breathing heavy and looking terrified. About 30 minutes later, the caretaker checked up on her again and found the 90-year-old unresponsive. When interviewed by police Saturday, Tristen Kurilla reportedly told a trooper: 'I killed that lady.'","Tristen Kurilla, 10, kept inside adult prison as he awaits trial for death of Helen Novak .

"It’s no secret that the nation’s dogs are facing an obesity crisis. But experts yesterday warned they are also in ‘behaviour meltdown’ because humans are so clueless when it comes to looking after them. The People’s Dispensary for Sick Animals (PDSA) said millions of dogs are becoming fat, and aggressive because their owners have a ‘grave lack of understanding’ of their basic needs. Vets say that lack of exercise is contributing to a ‘shocking’ rise in behavioural problems – with people and other pets on the receiving end of bored, anxious and badly trained dogs. Scroll down for video . Millions of dogs are becoming fat (left) and aggressive (right) because their owners have a ‘grave lack of understanding’ of their basic needs (file pictures) The PDSA’s Animal Wellbeing report estimates there are a quarter of a million incidents a week in which dogs behave aggressively. Many of our 8.1million dogs are being killed with kindness, with treats including beer, chips and leftover takeaways making them dangerously overweight and triggering diabetes, heart disease and arthritis. The problem is being exacerbated by lack of exercise. Almost one in three - which equates to 2.4million dogs - are not allowed to run off the lead every day. And almost one million are never taken for a walk at all. PDSA senior vet Elaine Pendlebury said too many people purchase dogs on a whim, without thinking about how much exercise the particular breed needs. Dogs are also falling foul of the long hours worked by their owners – and their increasingly sedentary lifestyle. With one in three dogs overweight, vets are predicting there will be more fat pets than slim ones in just five years’ time. The PDSA says that lack of exercise is contributing to a ‘shocking’ rise in destructive and aggressive behaviour – with people and other pets on the receiving end of bored, anxious and badly-trained dogs. The charity’s annual Animal Wellbeing report estimates that there are a quarter of a million incidents a week in which dogs behave aggressively towards people. And more than half of vets have noted an increase in dog on dog attacks. PDSA head of pet health and welfare Nicola Martin said: ‘We are undoubtedly a nation of animal lovers, with four out of five pet owners stating they feel physically or mentally healthier because of their pet. 'However, our latest findings reveal that anti-social behaviour in dogs continues to rise due to a worrying lack of training, socialisation and exercise. ‘Owners are sadly continuing to feed the wrong types of food with portion sizes out of control. Preventative health is also a major concern – the basics such as vaccinations and neutering are often ignored by owners, leaving their pets vulnerable to a wide range of deadly diseases.’ The PDSA commissioned YouGov to quiz 1,069 dog, cat and rabbit owners, plus almost 600 vets and veterinary nurses. It wants people to take part in its online Big Pet Survey so that it can gather even more information. A spokesman said: ‘The more that take the survey and share their views with us, the more we can identify the most vital and pressing pet welfare issues.’","Vets say lack of exercise is adding to 'shocking' rise in behavioural issues .

"A massively obese dachshund has lost 50 pounds after having a tummy tuck - and gone on to release an inspirational weight loss calendar. Two years ago, Obie tipped the scales at 5st 7lbs and even needed to wear a special harness to prevent injury to his bulging belly. But after being adopted by former veterinary technician Nora Vanatta in August 2012, he was put on a strict diet and exercise regimen. Scroll down for video . Obie's story went viral last year when social media was flooded with pictures of the grossly obese and miserable-looking dachshund. At his heaviest, he tipped the scales at 5st 7lbs . After some hard work and surgery to remove excess skin, the seven-year-old now weighs a healthy 1st 9lbs. Pictured, his calendar page for September . After some hard work and surgery to remove his excess skin, the seven-year-old now weighs a healthy 1st 9lbs. Obie's new owner has now released an inspirational calendar for 2015 to help motivate other overweight pets to shed their extra pounds. Ms Vanatta, from Portland, Oregon, said: 'I feel blessed to be involved in Obie's rehab and hope he can be an inspiration to any person or animal trying to lose weight. 'It is so important to introduce pups and kids to a healthy lifestyle and food choices as early as possible.' Dachshunds normally weigh 32lbs, but at 77lbs, a five-year-old Obie weighed more than twice that and was dubbed the World's Fattest Sausage Dog. Before he was adopted by Ms Vanatta, he had been cared for by an elderly couple who fed him whatever he wanted and couldn't exercise due to their ill health. Obie, pictured in his January calendar page, achieved his new look by following a strict diet . Obie's incredible transformation from obese daschund to a fit and healthy dog is charted in a 2015 calendar . Obie was so obese he needed a special harness to prevent his belly from rubbing against the floor . His extreme weight gain came after he was cared for by an elderly couple who fed him excessively and were unable to exercise him . Dachshunds normally weigh 32lbs, but at 77lbs, a five-year-old Obie weighed more than twice that . Out for walkies in his purple jacket - Obie's rolls of neck fat can be seen squashed up beneath his chin . Feed me, rather than throw me a bone, please! Fetch was never Obie's favorite pastime as an obese dog . He had to wear a special harness to stop his stomach rubbing against the floor, leading to painful chaffing. Ms Vanatta, who has a degree in Animal Science, added: 'He was obviously loved and his elderly owners just couldn't say no to those big brown eyes. 'I was thrilled to be able to help him with his new life. 'Now I want his journey to inspire other big animals and maybe even their owners to get healthy in the new year.' After he was adopted, she put him on a strict diet to lose some of his belly before walking him on a treadmill and taking him for a swim. After losing 40lbs, he had to have cosmetic surgery to remove several pounds of excess skin. His new owner says she wants 'his journey to inspire other big animals and maybe even their owners to get healthy' Ms Vanatta, who has a degree in Animal Science, said Obie 'was obviously loved' by his former owners . Exercise for Obie, pictured in his June calendar page, included walks on a treadmill and swimming . After he lost 40lbs, Obie needed cosmetic surgery to remove several pounds of excess skin . Recently, it emerged that Ms Vanatta was investigated by the charitable activities section of the Oregon Attorney General's Office. It was reported that in order to get her pet down to his target weight, she appealed for donations. The money donated online funded specialty diet food for Obie, skin-reduction surgery, an exercise regime and legal bills to fight off a custody battle. She wrote on Facebook in September: 'Recently, someone filed a complaint with the Oregon State Attorney General's office because I accepted financial gifts on Obie's behalf. 'The Oregon AG contends that, by stating publicly that I would donate the funds over and above Obie's medical needs and the custody suit to recognized 501(c)3 organizations, I misrepresented myself as a charity and misled the folks who supported Obie with financial gifts. 'This, the AG further contends, is proven by the reference to said gifts as ""donations."" 'This saddens me more than I can adequately express.' And soon after Ms Vanatta adopted Obie, he became the subject of a bitter custody battle with the Oregon Dachshund Rescue – the agency that coordinated with Vanatta to transfer Obie from the relative's custody to her home. They accused her of exploiting the dog for 'sensationalistic promotional value' and began fighting for custody. She detailed on Facebook how the lawsuit was settled after four months but 'unfortunately, the settlement came at a price: over $15K of Obie's money was used to fight a frivolous lawsuit.' She added: 'The bottom line: the Oregon AG conceded that no wrong doing was found and I may keep a small amount of your gifts to put toward Obie’s future care, but the balance is to be either sent to the State, or to recognized charities that they approve.' It was reported the Attorney General began looking into the matter after receiving complaints. The story of grossly Obie went viral last year when social media sites were flooded with photos of the miserable-looking dachshund lying on his back with his enormous belly chaffed from being dragged on the ground. After losing almost four stone, Obie has released a weight loss calendar. Pictured, the  page for February features a collage of the dachshund with his owner Nora Vanatta .

"Alex Salmond's hopes of winning the referendum on Scottish independence have been dealt a blow by a new poll showing a slump in support for his cause among teenagers. The SNP First Minister has been demanding that the 2014 vote should be extended to 16 and 17-year-olds –encouraged by research suggesting that younger age groups were more likely to be in favour of devolution. However, a survey by The Mail on Sunday in Scotland found that the teens questioned – who will be 16 or 17 in 2014 – are overwhelmingly in favour of keeping the Union. 'Slump': Lack of support for devolution among teens will be a disappointment to First Minister Alex Salmond, seen at a pro-independence rally in Edinburgh . According to the poll, only 26 per cent of them would back independence – even fewer than the 27 per cent rating recorded among adults in another recent survey by this newspaper. The SNP has long viewed young voters as a crucial part of its strategy to overturn decades-old resistance to independence from the majority of Scots voters. Scottish Secretary Michael Moore will tomorrow hold talks with the SNP about plans for the referendum. Until now, the Government has been resistant to lowering the voting age – but the poll findings could persuade them to adopt a more flexible approach. Polling expert Professor John Curtice said: ‘This shows the assumptions made by some that younger voters tend towards independence is some way out. ‘The crucial group are those over the age of 60, who are more inclined to vote. We may yet see a deal which extends the franchise for the referendum but we don’t know if the people in this category will turn up and vote, as turnout among younger voters is traditionally low.’ An SNP spokesman said: ‘The SNP will engage positively with our young people ahead of the referendum as we have a positive message to communicate.’","Mail on Sunday poll reveals Scottish teenagers are overwhelmingly in favour of keeping the Union .

"A Southern California father and his girlfriend have been found guilty of torture and child abuse for starving two of his children and beating a third. A San Bernardino County jury convicted 30-year-old Erik Austin Flores and 23-year-old Mariah Rita Sugg, of Hesperia, Wednesday. Each faces 20 years to life in prison when they're sentenced January 8. Abusive: Erik Austin Flores, 30, and Mariah Rita Sugg, 23 (left), have been convicted of torture and willful cruelty to a child with possibility of injury or death for staving and beating the man's three children (right) Prosecutors say the 4-year-old and 5-year-old children suffered permanent height loss because of their malnutrition and resembled concentration camp survivors and zombies when they were found and taken in by authorities earlier this year. Their 7-year-old brother, who did not starve because he was fed breakfast and lunch at school, testified that Sugg would beat him and his siblings, make them do exercises for hours and make them stand in the corner for entire days. According to a news release from the San Bernardino County District Attorney’s Office, Erik Flores’ children were removed from their custody June 6 by social workers acting on a tip from employees at the Marinello School of Beauty in Victorville. The staff at the beauty school noticed that the couple’s kids looked emaciated when they were brought to the school on May 16, according to testimony. The Good Samaritans compared two of Flores’ kids to ‘concentration camp’ survivors and ‘zombies,’ describing them as rail-thin and listless. All the while, authorities say Flores and Sugg were receiving food stamps. Emaciated: Flores' children, ages 4, 5 and 7, were removed from their home in June after Good Samaritans noticed the youngest two resembled 'concentration camp survivors.' Both children (pictured) suffered from a permanent loss of height as a result of starvation . Prosecutors say Flores and Sugg denied the toddlers food even while receiving food stamps . Dr. Mark Massi, a forensic pediatrician from Loma Linda University Medical Center, testified that both children suffered great bodily injury as a result of long-term starvation. Flores’ 4-year-old daughter would have died soon had she not been hospitalized, Massi testified. Both children suffered from a permanent loss of height as a result of starvation, according to Massi. He also said the girl’s development was arrested as a result of starvation. At age 4, the girl could barely talk and was not toilet trained. Prosecutors also argued that Flores had sexually abused the little girl in 2012 and 2014 based on injuries to her genitals caused by what Dr Massi described as blunt-force penetration. The 30-year-old father of three was not charged with sexual assault of his daughter due to insufficient evidence. Grave accusation: Prosecutors also argued that Flores (right) had sexually abused the little girl in 2012 and 2014 based on injuries to her genitals . Deputy District Attorney David Foy told the jury that Mariah Sugg made her boyfriend's 7-year-old son perform push-ups, sit-ups and run in place for hours, and if the child showed signs of slowing down, the woman would hit him in the head with a belt. The 7-year-old testified that Sugg only allowed him to eat small portions of food in between chores and endless exercise routines, reported the Victorville Daily Enterprise. According to Foy, Sugg would give the boy a small piece of a corn dog and then eat the rest of it herself. On Wednesday, a jury panel found Flores and Sugg each guilty of three counts of torture and three counts of willful cruelty to a child with possibility of injury or death. ‘I am so grateful that the jury took care to find justice for these children,’ David Foy said.","Erik Austin Flores, 30, and Mariah Rita Sugg, 23, have been convicted of torture and willful cruelty to a child with possibility of injury or death .

"Tony Abbott has vowed to 'sweat blood' for an Indigenous referendum, but won’t commit to a date until he’s confident it’ll be successful. The Prime Minister wants a referendum to be held in May 2017, but will not commit to a date. 'I am prepared to sweat blood on this,' the Prime Minister declared at a Recognise dinner at Redfern on Thursday night, saying the cause was 'at least as important as all the other causes this government has been prepared to take on'. Tony Abbott vowed to 'sweat blood' for an Indigenous referendum . The Age reported that while he favoured setting on the date of May 27, 2017 – the 50th anniversary of the 1967 referendum – Mr Abbott said: 'But I do not want it to fail because every Australian would be the loser. It is more important to get this right than to try to rush it through. 'We cannot finalise when the referendum should be held until we are comfortable that we have the proposal with the best chance of success.'

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten (left) and Prime Minister Tony Abbott, (right) pose with Recognise Joint Campaign Director Tanya Hosch at a fundraising diner for the Recognise movement in Sydney . Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said it was time for Australia to debate what form of referendum to support, not whether or not it supported recognition. A question should be settled before the next election and a referendum should follow after. 'Let us assume and believe in Australians that we are capable at last of rectifying this national failure,' the Labor leader told the event. Mr Shorten believed Australia needed to debate now what form of referendum to support . Mr Shorten stressed there was a lot of work left to be done in deciding the wording for the vote. But the nation could not afford to be bogged down by a small number of people keen to reboot old weapons of the history wars, nor submit to low expectations. 'We cannot allow ourselves to be put off our stroke by those who propose nothing and contribute nothing,' he said.

"I never thought I’d say this but I actually feel sorry for Manchester United. A little bit. Maybe. For years and years, Sir Alex Ferguson ran the referees, the clocks and the rules, but now that’s all gone. It surely can’t be a conscious thing from referees, but doesn’t it look to you as if United are now being punished for that? They were comfortable against Leicester on Sunday. When they went 3-1 in front you wondered how many goals they would rack up at the King Power Stadium. Adnan Januzaj (left), Wayne Rooney (centre) and Robin van Persie show their dejection at Leicester . Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal (centre) looks at the ground as he watches his side lose to Leicester . Former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson gestures towards his watch during his time in charge . But inexplicably Mark Clattenburg saw fit to completely ignore Foxes’ striker Jamie Vardy bulldozing into United full back Rafael. And to compound such a terrible error, Clattenburg chose to give a penalty when Rafael breathed on Vardy’s back in the box. Clattenburg can’t give one and not the other. Dreadful decision making from a referee who seems to have had a common sense bypass operation in the summer. He wasn’t great at the Emirates the week before. United’s defending from then on was appalling and they collapsed way too easily. But the main reason the game turned around so dramatically was the momentum Leicester gained from such a woeful refereeing decision. In some ways, they only realised they could win the game when they felt the referee was on their side. Rooney (left) complains to referee Mark Clattenburg during the match at the King Power Stadium on Sunday . Jamie Vardy celebrates after scoring Leicester City's fourth goal in their win over Manchester United . The King Power Stadium scoreboard shows the score as Leicester City pick up a famous victory . Leicester’s fight will rightly be applauded. But Vardy’s blatant dive for that first penalty will be ignored because it doesn’t fit the script of the underdog’s incredible comeback against the expensive giants. Leicester City are the kind of side who never give up – they’ve finally shaken off their 'chokers' tag after securing promotion last season. And I’ve enjoyed watching them this season - they’ve brought some adventure to the Premier League, and they’re doing it with players from non-League, lower league and through their own ranks. So let’s respect how they powered on to win the game in spectacular fashion. Without that ridiculous penalty decision though, you wonder where they would have found the belief they needed. Leonardo Ulloa celebrates after scoring Leicester's fifth goal from the penalty spot . United have suffered in other games this season: a Burnley defender virtually caught the ball in the area towards the end of the goalless draw at Turf Moor, yet no penalty was given. I know there are a large number of football fans who don’t like Manchester United: they will see this as karma for all the years of Fergie seemingly running things. They will also find it very funny.

"A woman who was bitten by a false widow spider as she slept is now terrified to close her eyes as she fears the poisonous creature is still on the loose in her house. Sarah Lucie Payne, 47, was woken in the night by a sharp pain in her left hand that she initially dismissed as a mosquito bite. But just hours later a painful, red blister erupted on her skin. The dog walker later found a web behind her bed and an expert was able to confirm that it was a false widow - Britain's most venomous spider - that had bitten her. Scroll down for video . Reaction: Sarah Lucie Payne, 47, (left) was woken in the night by a sharp pain in her left hand and initially dismissed it as a mosquito bite. But just hours later a painful, red blister erupted on her skin (right) Mrs Payne has since cleaned her house in Worthing, West Sussex, but can't find the spider. She now fears that it may strike again. She said: 'I think it is very very bizarre. I've searched the house but I can't find it. I have to have a search around the bedroom when I go to bed and I'm looking around myself. 'I have even taken the pictures off the wall to see if it is hiding, but I can't find it. 'I'm just hoping that I can't possibly be bitten twice. That would be really bad luck.' False widows – cousins of the infamous black widow spider – give very painful bites which often swell as the body tries to combat the venom. Some people have reported being left unconscious by the bites, but to date there have never been any confirmed deaths from them. About the size of a 10p piece, with a bulbous body and white markings, the false widow spider is now a fairly common sight in people’s homes, where it seeks refuge in autumn as the weather turns. Some false widows are native to Britain, but the most venomous, the noble false widow, was first imported in fruit crates from the Canary Islands more than a century ago. Since then, they have spread northwards from the South Coast. Mrs Payne, who lives with her husband, Ian, 50, was bitten in the middle of the night earlier this month and initially dismissed it as a mosquito bite. But after the bite started to bubble and blister she discovered a false widow's web behind her bed and a friend who keeps spiders confirmed she had been bitten by the poisonous creature. Poisonous: False widows (pictured) – cousins of the infamous black widow spider – give very painful bites which often swell as the body tries to combat the venom. They are now fairly common in British homes . She thought the wound would heal itself but a dentist later told her to go straight to Worthing Hospital for emergency treatment when the poison started to spread. Mrs Payne said: 'I woke up in the night and got up to go to the loo and though ""oh that's feel strange, I think I've been bitten"" - it was itchy - but I went back to sleep. 'In the morning I had this little red patch but I carried on with my day until it started to feel like it was rubbing on my coat sleeve. 'I looked down and it had this massive red blister - it looked like a big jelly baby. 'I wasn't that worried about it - I thought it was really weird - but I showed it to someone who is a bit of a spider expert and keeps tarantulas. Wound: Mrs Payne, from Worthing, West Sussex, initially thought that the wound would heal itself, but a dentist later told her to go to the hospital. She was later given antibiotics to treat the infection . 'He said it was definitely a false widow bite and said that I would know it was one because they have very messy webs. 'I knew then that it was because I had been looking around my bedroom and next to the bed I found this huge cobweb and when I saw it I thought exactly that - it was really messy. 'I went to the dentist a few days later and she said I should go straight to A and E. 'It was getting a red ring around it. They removed the blister, cleaned it, dressed it, and give me a week's worth of antibiotics. 'It's getting better but it keeps tingling and fizzing. I think it is very very bizarre.' Growing population: The false widow spider was first spotted in the UK in 1879 - they are now a common sight in many British homes . The spiders are distinctive for their shiny, black flesh, bulbous bodies, thick legs and skull-like patterns. Millions of false widows, Britain's most poisonous spider, are found across the UK and the population is growing. Also known as steatoda nobilis, it is frequently confused for the black widow, which has deadly venom. The false widow was first spotted in the UK in Torquay, Devon, in 1879. It is understood that it may have made its way to these shores from Madeira or the Canary Islands in a shipment of bananas. The species has a brown bulbous abdomen with cream markings that look like a skull. They have long legs and can reach about 15mm in size. The Natural History Museum says that warmer summers mean the spider is spreading northwards through the UK, having been found mainly in southern England. This theory is backed by its wildlife surveys where people report sightings to them.HOW TO AVOID BITES AND WHAT TO DO IF YOU GET ONE . The key message is that you shouldn't disturb spiders if you can help it because they will usually only bite you if they feel threatened. To avoid it while asleep, remove everything from under the bed so that the only way the spiders can get up on the bed is to crawl up one of the four legs. Do not leave clothes around in piles for long periods as spiders like to hide in them and shake shoes in case a spider has crawled in overnight. If you have a garage store things in plastic bags if you use them with your hands and feet and cannot see inside. Also seal cardboard boxes if you are storing things. If you are unfortunate enough to be bitten and have a reaction, pack the wound in ice and seek medical attention.","Sarah Lucie Payne, 47, was bitten as she slept at home in West Sussex .

"A Powerball winner has died broke and all alone in hospice care, just 12 years after raking in $27million cash from a lottery jackpot. David Lee Edwards, a convicted felon from Ashland, Kentucky, bought a mansion in a gated community, dozens of expensive cars and even a LearJet with the share of a record $280million jackpot he won in August 2001. But drug addiction and his free-spending ways left Edwards and his wife Shawna broke and living in a squalid storage unit contaminated with human feces within five years. Shawna left him not long after and remarried. Unhappy ending: David Lee Edwards, pictured with his new wife Shawna at their Malibu wedding shortly after winning the lottery, died Saturday in hospice at age 58 . Edwards bought this 6,000-square-foot mansion in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, for $1.5million. He lost it five years later . Big spender: Edwards spent $1.9million on this LearJet to ferry him between his mansion in Florida and his hometown in Kentucky. He even had a personal pilot . In the end, Edwards' first ex-wife and her husband drove him from Florida back home to Ashland. He died in hospice care Saturday at age 58. Edwards' friends and family say his tragic story can serve as a parable about the corrupting influence of money. By the end of his life he had lost every last penny of his $27million fortune and died owing thousands of dollars to friends. Both Edwards and Shawna contracted hepatitis from their needle drug use and both were arrested multiple times and had numerous run-ins with police for possession of crack cocaine, prescription pills and heroin, the Broward-Palm Beach New Times reported in 2007. Shawna bounced into and out of drug rehab for addition to OxyContin and other drugs, the newspaper reported. Shortly after winning, Edwards bought a $1.6million, 6,000-square-foot house in a private tennis and golf community in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. He spend $600,000 on another home nearby. He paid $1.9million for a LearJet, bought three losing racehorses and acquired a fiber optics installation company and a limo business for $4.5million. Neighbors complained that Edwards had so many cars in front of his house that it looked like a dealership. His purchases included a $90,000 Dodge Viper (pictured) Edwards also bought more than 200 pieces of medieval armor and weapons - all of it cheap reproductions . He paid his ex-wife $500,000 to hand over custody of his teenage daughter Tiffani. She couldn't drive at the time, but he bought her a $35,000 Hummer golf cart to drive around the community. He collected cars - he treated himself to a $200,000 Lamborghini Diablo super car and a $90,000 Dodge Viper. At one point, he had $1million in vehicles parked in front of his house - so many that his neighbors complained that the upscale home in the upscale community started to look like a car dealership. 'I want this money to last, for me, for my future wife, for my daughter and future generations.' David Lee Edwards in August 2001 after winning the lottery . He invited in an NBC News TV crew and bragged that he was wearing a $78,000 diamond-encrusted gold watch and a $159,000 ring. He showed off his $30,000 plasma screen TV. Edwards also amassed a collection 200 swords, armor and antiques - all of it cheap reproductions. In his first three months as a . millionaire, he spent $3million. One year after his win, he had spent . $12million, the New Times estimates. He lost every bit of it by 2006. Edwards intended to do right. On the day that he publicly claimed his winnings, he promised to use his money responsibly. 'You know, a lot of people, they're out of work. Doesn't have hardly anything,' he told reporters. 'And . so I didn't want to accept this money by saying I'm going to get . mansions and I'm going to get cars, I'm going to do this and that. I . would like to accept it with humility. Sickly: Edwards, show left with his daughter Tiffani in 2010, reportedly contracted hepatitis from his repeated drug use. His daughter says there is no money left from his winnings . Troubled: Edwards and his wife Shawna had multiple run-ins with police as their lives spiraled out rapidly down after the lottery money dried up . 'I want this money to last, for me, for my future wife, for my daughter and future generations.' Shortly after his win, he hired a financial adviser and a lawyer to look after his assets. 'If . he followed my advice, he'd be pulling in about $85,000 a month for the . rest of his life,' financial planner James Gibbs told the Broward-Palm . Beach New Times in 2007. Instead, Gibbs says, Edwards sold off the stocks and bonds that Gibbs invested on his behalf. On Tuesday, his daughter, Tiffani Lee Edwards, said that her father had . left her with nothing - not even a life insurance policy. 'There is NO MONEY anywhere!!!!' she wrote on Facebook. Tiffani, . whom Edwards enrolled in a private college prep academy in South . Florida during his short brush with wealth, now works as a clerk at an . amusement park in West Virginia. Before he won the lottery, Edwards was unemployed and living with his then-girlfriend Shawna, who is 19 years his junior. He had spent a third of his life in prison after he was arrested for armed robbery. He borrowed money from a friend to pay his water bill. After he got his water turned on, he used the rest to buy a pizza and $7 worth of lotto tickets from Clark's Pump-N-Shop. He picked the winning numbers himself and shared the $2800million jackpot with three other winners. His $41million lump sum portion came out to $27million after taxes.","David Lee Edwards, 58, died Saturday in hospice care in his hometown of Ashland, Kentucky, after blowing through $27million in five years .

"A stunned family who thought their pet cat had come back from the dead just 24 hours after his funeral realised they had buried the wrong animal. Mother-of-two Karen Jones, 48, of Ashford, Kent, was heartbroken when she spotted what she believed was her missing black tom Norman dead at the side of a busy road. A passer-by then told the family that the creature had been hit by a passing car and killed instantly. Reunited: Mother-of-two Karen Jones, 48, of Ashford, Kent, is pictured with her cat Norman after the brief scare . The tearful owner scooped up the dead animal, convinced it was her beloved two-year-old pet,  because it was the same size and had the same coloured fur and eyes. Her son Harry, 22, spent two hours digging a grave in the back garden before the whole family buried the cat with Norman's favourite toy mouse. After the hour-long ceremony they then set a black porcelain cat on top of the grave as a head stone. But the next day the family were amazed when Norman scampered into their kitchen - and ate his breakfast. Shocked Mrs Jones believed her cat had come back from the dead and ran outside to see if he had dug himself out of the ground. Wrong animal: Karen Jones next to the grave of the black cat who she thought was her own Norman . It was only when she found the grave still intact she realised they must have buried the wrong cat. She today made a sombre appeal to try and trace the owner of the cat - still buried in her back garden. Mrs Jones said: ‘I hadn't seen Norman all morning because he often goes roaming around. So I had a feeling it was him when I saw the cat by the side of the road. ‘It was exactly the same size, same colour and had the same face. We were in tears all day. We brought it back and buried him in bags in the bottom of our garden. ‘But then the next day Norman came wandering in and he was really grumpy because he hadn't had any breakfast. We couldn't believe it. We just picked him up and started cuddling him. ‘At first I thought he had been resurrected from the dead - but he didn't know what all the fuss was about. Then I realised we must have had the wrong cat. ‘It was incredibly emotional because we had spent a whole day grieving. Suddenly we found ourselves switching from tears of sadness to tears of joy.’ In a celebration of Norman's return on Tuesday, Mrs Jones’s brother Paul May, 45, wrote and played a song to the whole family called ‘It is the Day of Norman's Rising’. She added: ‘It is all really funny but I was devastated when I found out that he had died and there must be a cat owner out there who feels like I did.’ Mr May, who works for a youth offending service, said: ‘I was standing at the sink making myself a drink when I heard the cat flap and just saw this tail in the conservatory. Thought he was gone: Shocked Mrs Jones at first believed her cat had come back from the dead . ‘I said '""Is that you Norman?"" and he meowed back. He's a very talkative cat. I took him up to show everyone and I said ""Norman has risen from the dead"".’ She also revealed that Norman had previously been a notorious fighter and she had always feared that a day might come when he wouldn't return home. 'At first I thought he had been resurrected from the dead - but he didn't know what all the fuss was about. Then I realised we must have had the wrong cat' Karen Jones . A year ago he broke a leg and just a month ago he received a scratch to his eye after a fight with a fellow cat. But now she is just happy that the cat is home and hopes that she will not have to hold another vigil anytime soon. Mrs Jones, who is a store trainer at Sainsbury's, said: ‘Norman has been in the wars in the past and has come back dragging an injured leg behind him. ‘He is a tom cat so just goes roaming about and pops in every now and then for some food. ‘But we hadn't seen him for a few hours that morning and I thought he might have got in another fight or something. The whole family are just delighted he is home.’","Karen Jones, 48, of Ashford, Kent, spotted black cat dead near road .

"Roberto Martinez went on the defensive, which is more than could be said for his team on Tuesday night. Or this season, for that matter. That’s 17 goals shipped in this convoluted calendar of Europa League and domestic football. And a first defeat to Swansea in 21 fixtures, the product of a game skewed almost entirely in favour of the side Martinez used to manage. Not that he was in the mood to enter into a conversation about numbers. ‘Last year was the club’s record points tally in the Premier League so we can share statistics all you want,’ he said. The look on his face suggested it wasn’t a sincere invitation. Nathan Dyer shoots to score past Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard to give Swansea the lead on Tuesday night . Dyer is congratulated by his Swansea team-mates after putting the Welsh side ahead against the Toffees . Gylfi Sigurdsson clenches his fist in celebration after sliding in to double Swansea's advantage over Everton . Dutchman Marvin Emnes is congratulated by Jonjo Shelvey after scoring Swansea's third goal of the night . Swansea (4-2-3-1): Tremmel 6.5; Richards 6.5, Fernandez 5.5, Williams 6, Taylor 5.5; Carroll 6 (Ki 70, 6), Shelvey 7; Sigurdsson 7 (Emnes 85), Dyer 7 (Routledge 68, 6), Montero 8; Gomis 6. Subs not used: Fabianski, Rangel, Bartley, Fulton. Booked: Fernandez, Shelvey.

Referee: Roger East 6 . Att: 20,397 . MOM: Jefferson Montero . These are trying times for the likeable man at Everton’s helm. They sit 14th in the Premier League, having been beaten 3-2 on their own turf by Crystal Palace at the weekend. That situation, coupled with the demands and consequences of the Europa League, which Swansea know only too well, necessitated the seven changes Martinez made to his line-up. Less understandable was Martinez’s view of the result, which he said included ‘several positives’. Among them, he said Tony Hibbert, playing his first game in seven months, looked ‘sharp’. Without labouring a cruel point, the 33-year-old was ripped to shreds by Jefferson Montero, Swansea’s rapid left winger. As Swansea manager Garry Monk said: ‘Montero was a very good threat in one versus one situations - it was something we targeted when we saw the team-sheets.’ It was Montero who made the first-half opener for Nathan Dyer, before Gylfi Sigurdsson capitalised on some farcical defending after the break and Tim Howard was too easily beaten by Marvin Emnes’s late strike. ‘It is something we need to address,’ Martinez said in reference to Everton’s defending, though he later denied Howard’s confidence is becoming an issue. Everton wideman Bryan Oviedo made his long-awaited return to the Toffees' first-team following injury . Everton frontman Samuel Eto'o takes aim  as Swansea midfielder Tom Carroll (centre) watches on . Swansea midfielder Shelvey shields the ball away from Everton summer signing Muhamed Besic (right) ‘Certain individuals were very pleasing,’ Martinez said. ‘The night was very positive in some aspects and very disappointing in the result. ‘It was typical cup football once we lost the goal. The scoreline reflects that Swansea were clinical in front of goal and we weren’t.’ But in reality, that was generous to Everton and harsh on Swansea, whose rookie manager Garry Monk freely admits to calling his old boss for advice. ‘It was a good night,’ Monk said. ‘Three goals and a clean sheet – I couldn’t have asked for more. I thought we played well against a very good side. They came here with a full squad. ‘This competition is very important to the team, the crowd and the club.’ Indeed, a replica of the trophy they won sits in the foyer of this stadium, but Monk’s selection hinted that the Premier League remains an inhibiting concern, with five changes to the side that lost here against Southampton on Saturday. Initially, that looked a gamble. Everton’s Bryan Oviedo, playing his first game since a horrible double fracture of his left leg in January, won an early free-kick that could, with luck, have proved decisive. Luke Garbutt took the kick and Antolin Alcaraz shook off Ashley Williams a little too easily. It left Alcaraz five yards from goal with a free swing, but stand-in goalkeeper Gerhard Tremmel managed to block. Hibbert had earlier wasted a golden chance after more lax Swansea defending, slicing over from inside the area. Sadly for Hibbert, that was the highlight. He was equalling Everton’s club record for an outfield player by appearing in his 15th season, but he was shown up by Montero in the moments immediately preceding Dyer’s 29th-minute opener. The Ecuadorian left winger went outside and then in before squaring across the six-yard box for Dyer, who finished at the far post. Dyer was on the pitch for less than an hour against Southampton, when Roy Hodgson saw one of his lesser displays, so this was a fine response. Montero looks a potential snip at £4m. Everton wideman Christian Atsu passes the ball under pressure from Sigurdsson . Goalscorer Dyer looks back having been dispossessed by Everton midfielder Darron Gibson . Swansea striker Wilfried Bony watched the game from the stands . Everton responded by bring Romelu Lukaku on at half-time for Samuel Eto’o and within a minute he had found space and rocketed a shot marginally over the bar. Aiden McGeady then did likewise. That was as close as Everton came and they were two down after 64 minutes. Tom Carroll played in Jonjo Shelvey, who hit a hopeful cross into the area. Under little pressure, Sylvain Distin misread the bounce and headed against his own bar. Sigurdsson buried the rebound from close range. ‘The second goal was a bad decision, if you want,’ Martinez said. ‘Luck plays a part - it bounces to the striker.’ Emnes wrapped it up after 87 minutes, his low shot going past Howard without much bother. ‘We kept 15 clean sheets last season,’ Martinez added. But that was then. Like our MailOnline Sport Facebook page.","Swansea beat Everton for first-time ever to progress in Capital One Cup .

"A police document signed by a young Adolf Hitler before he became a Nazi dictator noting his change of address in Vienna is being sold at auction. The 20-year-old Hitler described himself as a writer, when he completed the slip of paper in 1909. The document, from August 22, lists Hitler's address as Sechshauserstrasse 58/II which exists today as a café called Maxx. The document, pictured, which was signed by Adolf Hitler, claimed that the future dictator was a writer . According to the auction house, Hitler was made homeless a few months after signing the document . Adolf Hitler, pictured, was living in Vienna, Austria in August 1909 and was under severe financial pressure . He stayed in the property, his third home in Vienna, for less than a month before being evicted because he was broke. The Nazi dictator listed his occupation as Schriftsteller, meaning writer, on the 12-inch by 9-inch paper - which also features an official police stamp. Sam Heller, from Nate D Sanders who are listing the item, said: 'After rejection by The Academy of Fine Arts, he led a transient existence as an impoverished and mentally unstable young adult. 'He ultimately became homeless about four months from the time of this document. 'Here, as Viennese law required, he registers a change of address with the government. 'He fills in all the fields of the partially-printed Meldzettel form in his hand, dating it 22 August 1909 and listing his residence as Room 21/ 58 Sechshauserstrasse, Vienna. 'Hitler lived at that address from August 20 to September 16, 1909. 'No further records exist until his application to the Asylum for the Shelterless in December of that year. 'There are tears and minor paper loss to the right corners and remnants of mounting to verso - but it is in very good condition. 'It is an historically important document filling in details of Hitler's transient life as a young adult - the ""what if"" time period, had his life pivoted in any other direction.' The document is being sold by Los Angeles-based online auction house Nate D Sanders. Bidding on the document, which is on sale until December 16, starts at $25,000 . The company earlier auctioned Hitler inscribed 'Mein Kampf' volumes for more than $33,650.","The police document was signed by Adolf Hitler in August 1909 in Vienna .

"Police are hunting this speeding motorist who at first glance seems only to be concerned about the young girl he just ran over, but in reality he was simply threatening the traumatised teenager to not tell anyone. CCTV footage of the incident shows Zara Zaytseva, 13, waiting at traffic lights and beginning to cross when they switch from green to amber. She had been on her way home after visiting friends in the city of Ufa in the central Russian Republic of Bashkortostan.

The girl's furious mother Guzel, 45, said: 'When Zara got home she was quite badly shaken but luckily not seriously hurt. 'The very least the man could have done was phone an ambulance.

"A wealthy British expat described as a ‘sex obsessed Jekyll and Hyde narcissist’ was last night sentenced to 30 years in prison for murder and rape. Robert Dolby, a 74-year-old originally from Romford, Essex, was also portrayed as a ‘lying pervert’ before his conviction at the Alpes-Maritimes Assizes in Nice, in the south of France. He was found guilty of killing a woman he invited to dinner in 2010, and also of sexually assaulting and then trying to kill another victim in 2012. All of the crimes are said to have taken place in Dolby’s flat in Beausoleil, the Riviera resort town just outside Monaco, and at another apartment nearby. Wealthy British expat Robert Dolby, 74, was sentenced to 30 years for rape, attempted murder and murder at the Alpes-Maritime Assizes court, in Nice (pictured) The former cook was convicted of murdering Annie-Claude Chevalier, 68, in 2010 by administering a powerful sedative. Dolby was also found guilty of and raping and attempting to murder a 31-year old woman, whose full name cannot be published for legal reasons, two years later. The jury followed the prosecuting judge's call for a 30-year sentence, 15 of them without remission. Dolby’s name will also remain on France’s sex offenders list, and he will be expelled from the country the moment he is released from prison. On February 25 2012, a 29-year-old Frenchwoman identified only as Cindy was found nude in the Beausoleil apartment block, with her nose broken, and covered in blood and bruises. ‘Dolby tried to kill me,’ Cindy told investigators, confirming she had met her alleged attacker in the bar of a Monte Carlo hotel. When police began to investigate Cindy’s complaint, they uncovered evidence linking Dolby with the murder in 2010. The crimes are said to have taken place in  Beausoleil (pictured) the Riviera resort town just outside Monaco . It was in that year that the murder took place in Dolby’s former home in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, close to Beausoleil. A court-appointed psychologist described Dolby as having a ‘Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde character’, acting like a relaxed charmer one minute, and then turning into a murderous, 'grinning sex-crazed ‘monster’. Dolby also continually lied about his previous convictions, including ones in Britain. Julie Rouillard, advocate general of the Assizes, said: ‘We’re not talking about an aged man whose past acts have caught up with him, but a predator still on the loose at 72 years old.’ Dolby, who was in jail on remand for two years, was also described as a ‘cold pervert who lies about everything.’ He retired to the sun-soaked south of France in 2005 with his wife, who died of cancer in 2009. In 1991 Dolby was sentenced to four years in prison in the UK for sexually assaulting a colleague he invited to dinner. He also has more than a dozen previous convictions, mostly for theft and burglary. Another psychiatrist said Dolby displayed signs of ‘narcissistic perversion’, and was capable of throwing out ‘seductive hooks’ while at the same time being ‘emotionally anaesthetised, and very cold’.","Robert Dolby, 74, guilty of murder, attempted murder,  and rape .

"David Cameron last night issued a desperate appeal to voters in the Rochester by-election to vote tactically to keep out Ukip – as a poll showed the anti-EU party with a 12-point lead. In a highly unusual move, the Prime Minister urged Labour, Liberal Democrat and even Green supporters to lend their votes to the Tory candidate Kelly Tolhurst to prevent a ‘Ukip boost, and all the uncertainty and instability that leads to’. The poll, commissioned by the former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft, put Ukip on 44 per cent, the Conservatives on 32, Labour on 17 and the Lib Dems on only 2 per cent. Scroll down for video . David Cameron,  on a visit to Strood Academy in Rochester, urged Labour, Liberal Democrat and even Green supporters to lend their votes to the Tories . A new poll by Lord Ashcroft puts Ukip comfortably ahead of thee Conservatives by 12 points . The finding represents a slight narrowing of Ukip’s lead since the last survey a fortnight ago, when it was 15 points. But it still suggests a comfortable win for Ukip’s Mark Reckless, the Kent seat’s former Tory MP, despite a massive Conservative push. However, the poll also produced a glimmer of good news for Mr Cameron by showing the Tories could re-take the seat at the general election. Thirty-six per cent of Rochester voters said they would probably vote Conservative next year, compared with 35 per cent backing Ukip. This could curb the enthusiasm of some Eurosceptic Tory MPs, who are weighing up whether to follow Mr Reckless and Clacton MP Douglas Carswell by defecting to Ukip. Defeat in Rochester and Strood on Thursday of next week would be a serious setback for the Prime Minister. During another visit to the seat yesterday, he made a direct appeal to non-Tory voters to lend their votes to the Conservatives to keep Ukip out. The Prime Minister said the seat was now a ‘two-horse race’ between Ukip's Mark Reckless (left) and Tory candidate Kelly Tolhurst (right) Mr Cameron told the Kent Messenger that the seat was now a ‘two-horse race’. Voters faced a ‘very clear choice’. He said: ‘You can vote for Ukip and be part of the national campaign and another notch for them in their development and then the great caravan will move on, or you can vote for Kelly, who is a hard-working person, born and raised locally. ‘I would say to people who have previously voted Labour, Liberal, Green or anything, that if you want a strong local candidate and don’t want some Ukip boost and all the uncertainty and instability that leads to, then Kelly is the choice.’ Ukip said it was extraordinary that Mr Cameron was trying to ‘shoehorn Labour voters into his survival strategy’. Mr Reckless said: ‘Every time David Cameron, his ministers, and his MPs come to this constituency they show us that, for them, this election is not about the people of Rochester and Strood, but about their own political careers, and whether they can survive a shift to Ukip here in Rochester and Strood next Thursday, and across the country next May.’","David Cameron urged people in Rochester by-election to vote tactically .

"A person who says they are accused killer Gable Tostee has taken to a bodybuilding forum to defend the 28-year-old over the death of New Zealand bank clerk Warriena Wright. Tostee was charged with the murder of Ms Wright who fell 14 storeys from his Gold Coast apartment balcony in August after meeting him on online dating app Tinder. He was remanded in custody but was released last month on strict bail conditions which require him to live with his parents in Carrara, keep off Tinder, stay off Facebook, not allowed to drink alcohol and adhere to a nightly curfew. Scroll down for video . Under the user name of 'GT', a person on a bodybuilding forum has defended accused murderer Gable Tostee . Under the user name of 'GT', the person has defended Tostee, saying there have been many 'misconceptions and untruths' that have been circulating in the media and the public about his involvement. They also posted several pictures claiming to be from inside Tostee's apartment. One of the photographs show a tanning machine he owns on the Avalon Apartments balcony on Orchid Avenue, which has spectacular views over Surfers Paradise. GT added he had been left distraught after Ms Wright's death and believed his silence on the topic had done more harm than good. Tostee is accused of throwing Warriena Wright off his apartment balcony on the Gold Coast in August . Ms Wright was a bank clerk and had travelled to Australia for a friend's wedding when she died . 'Knowing I was the last person to be with her, it has left me permanently scarred and not a day passes that I don't wish I could go back in time and prevent it,' GT wrote. 'For at least a week after it happened I was so overwhelmed I was unable to laugh or even crack a smile. 'I broke down in tears several times a day, or whenever I saw her picture in the news. 'Even though I had only known her for a night I was horrified that this had happened to her. I would never wish for it to happen to anybody.' GT said he sympathised with Ms Wright's family and it pained him to think of them. 'While I have not had the chance to meet or speak to Warriena's family, it pains me to think of the loss and suffering they must be experiencing,' he wrote. Along with the posts, GT posted photos of what is believed to be Tostee's balcony overlooking Surfers Paradise . Tostee's case is set to be mentioned in January after he was released on strict bail conditions in November . The Avalon Apartments is where Ms Wright fell to her death in August from the 14th floor . GT also slammed news outlets for the coverage of the case, describing it as 'disgraceful'. 'They have no respect for the dignity of the people involved,' he said. 'A young woman had died and they needed a villain. My silence only fuelled peoples' imagination, and the media did everything they could to exploit that, including lying and misleading. 'They did everything they could to establish me as an evil monster, a portrayal which could not be further from the truth.' Tostee has always maintained his innocence in Ms Wright's death and was released from custody last month . Queensland police have confirmed they know of the post's existence and were looking to confirm if it was Tostee . Queensland police have told news.com.au they knew of the post's existence and were looking to confirm if it was in fact Tostee. But Detective Superintendent Dave Hutchinson said: 'It does not appear to be a breach of any bail condition.' If GT is in fact Tostee, this would not be the first time he has reached out on social media. During his time in custody, the 28-year-old posted a message to family and friends on Facebook - including an address for them to post letters to him. 'To all my friends and those who have been supporting me, I want to thank you and say that I miss you all,' he wrote from jail. 'I have been in custody for almost a month now for a crime I did not commit and have lost contact with almost everyone. 'I maintain my absolute innocence and hope that this nightmare will be over soon.' Queensland police say this post would not breach his bail conditions imposed by the court . If GT is in fact Tostee, it is not the first time he has used social media to maintain his innocence . Tostee's case will be mentioned in January. Until he faces trial, which is expected to be next year, Tostee cannot drive, is banned from carousing on the Surfers Paradise nightclub strip and it not allowed after dark. After he walked free from jail, Daily Mail Australia obtained a letter that was part of his desperate bid to be released . In the handwritten note scrawled on a lined A4 piece of paper, Gable Tostee apologised for drink driving and admits to 'drowning myself with alcohol'. The letter was penned at Queensland's Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre in a scrappy style with occasional spelling errors and includes an admission by Tostee that 'I have a problem with binge drinking' and that he has put people's lives at risk. Tostee specifically apologises for drinking in the early hours of July 27 when he was caught drink driving by police, saying it was the 'wake-up call I needed'.

"Victims: Postmistress Fiona and her husband, Paul,  were forced to live off mouldy bread after Diane Lathlean helped herself to the profits . A couple running a village shop and post office were shocked to find their takings dramatically increased when one of their employees went off on a world cruise. And on her return the couple’s profits plummeted – by so much that postmistress Fiona Senior, 48, had to give up taking a salary out of the business and feed her family mouldy bread. Mrs Senior’s husband Paul, 45, became suspicious of shop assistant Diane Lathlean and watched hours of CCTV footage from inside the shop. He discovered that the shop worker – who his wife counted as one of her best friends – had been betraying them by pilfering stock for years, a court heard yesterday. The couple believe mother-of-three Lathlean, 50, stole stock and cash over a period of four years before she was caught. They believe her thefts amount to £50,000. While they struggled, she was able to afford to go on a string of round-the-world cruises, including trips to Hawaii, the Bahamas and California. After being confronted by Mr Senior, Lathlean quit her job, and later dropped a note through the door offering to repay more than £3,000 for missing stock from the shop in Ampleforth, North Yorkshire. She denied stealing £3,050 of goods but was convicted by Scarborough Magistrates on Tuesday. She now faces jail after being sent to York Crown Court to be sentenced. Chairman of the bench Carl Harwood told her: ‘The offence is so serious you need greater punishment than we can give you.’ Mr Senior told the court he had long suspected his employee was stealing, adding: ‘It stuck out a lot more when Diane was on holiday. We could afford to pay our bills when she was on holiday. ‘I suspected after a while there was something wrong. But because Diane was Fiona’s best friend she just would not hear of it.’ Lathlean, a part-time shelf-stacker and counter assistant, earned around £90 a week in wages. Lathlean, 50, was found guilty of the theft of £3,050 worth of stock from the store in  North Yorkshire . Yet she enjoyed regular cruises and was a Tottenham Hotspur season ticket holder, travelling all over the country staying in hotels, her victims said. Mr Senior told the court the ‘appalling’ takings suddenly flourished during Lathlean’s three-week voyage to Panama. ‘We didn’t have to put money into the business for three weeks but when Diane returned we were back to square one,’ he said. The couple ‘inherited’ Lathlean when they took over the post office and shop in 2008. She knew most of the people in the village and had served them for more than 20 years. When Mr Senior checked the footage he spotted Lathlean slipping groceries into her bag or dropping them into a drawer to retrieve later. He said: ‘I was in shock, deep shock, at the whole scenario.’ A court heard the owners struggled to keep Post Office afloat while Lathlean splashed out on luxury holidays . Lathlean, of Ampleforth, told police she enjoyed regular holidays because her husband Simon had a well-paid job with American Express. Outside court Mr Senior said: ‘We put £43,000 into the business while we lived like paupers and she was cruising the world.’ Mother-of-two Mrs Senior said: ‘We were eating mouldy bread and buying second-hand Christmas presents... I was devastated when I found out what Diane had been doing. 'She was my best friend... Now I don’t even want to be in the same room as her. The Seniors received a £28,000 settlement for alleged theft of money and goods by Lathlean in a civil case prior to her trial. For legal reasons it was not disclosed to magistrates.","Diane Lathlean was found guilty of theft at Scarborough Magistrates Court .

"The fisherman who survived 12 days adrift off the coast of Hawaii is set to be reunited with his long lost son, who he lost contact with two decades ago. Ron Ingraham, 67, was weak, dehydrated and hungry - but otherwise healthy - after surviving by eating raw fish when his boat was blown off course on Thanksgiving Day. He was found by a US navy destroyer 64 miles out to sea - nine days after the US Coast Guard called off the search for him following an operation that covered 12,000 square miles of ocean. Scroll down for video . Commander John Barsano, welcomes Ron Ingraham, 67,  aboard the USS Paul Hamilton. The fisherman was rescued by the US Navy after spending 12 days adrift off the coast of Hawaii . But the harrowing ordeal has provided an unexpected opportunity for Mr Ingraham to get back in contact with the son who he last spoke to in the 1990s. Zakary Ingraham, who now lives in St. Joseph, Missouri, says he is trying to get out to Hawaii to see his father, who arrived on the island of Molokai on Wednesday. 'When I see my dad, I'm going to give him a big hug,' he said. 'I'm going to do everything I can to get out there as soon as possible.' The first Zakary, who grew up in Hawaii, heard of his father's disappearance was when the Coast Guard called him as Mr Ingraham's next of kin to say that they were calling off the search. Mr Ingraham's sailboat the Malia is pictured being towed back to port in Kaunakakai by a Coast Guard cutter . Zakary Ingraham (right), who now lives in St. Joseph, Missouri, says he is trying to get out to Hawaii to see his father, who arrived on the island of Molokai on Wednesday . 'It's tough to put into words,' he said. 'You're crushed, and you don't know what to do. 'And of course, I'm in Missouri so that made it feel worse I couldn't go out and look for him. It was horrible. He added: 'I held on to hope. I knew my dad was tough. So I didn't feel like he was gone.' But as the days wore on, full-time student Zakary, 43, resigned himself to accepting his dad was not coming back - until he got a call on Tuesday to say that his father was found. Sailors assigned to  USS Paul Hamilton (DDG 60) rescue Mr Ingraham after responding to his brief mayday call . Ron Ingraham, 67, was rescued on Tuesday morning after 12 days lost at sea. His friends and family had planned a funeral service for Saturday . 'At first it didn't register,' he said. 'They said, 'He's alive,'' 'You might as well be on a Broadway show jumping up and clicking your heels, I was so happy.' While his father was missing, Zakary tried to learn more about him. He said he reached a fellow Molokai fisherman who told him his dad had set out for the island of Lanai, where he planned to sell his fish. 'I always wanted to find him and get in touch with him,' Zakary said, adding how difficult it had been as his fisherman father did not have a cellphone and could not be contact on social media. The fisherman had reemerged with an eight-second distress call on Tuesday morning: 'We got a mayday here. Mayday. This is the Malia. Anybody picking this up?' Full-time student Zakary, 43, resigned himself to accepting his dad was not coming back - until he got a call on Tuesday to say that his father was found . Ingraham, center, was hungry and dehydrated when US Navy personnel reached him on Tuesday after he sent out another distress call . Mr Ingraham told ABC News that he ran into trouble after his radio was destroyed when a rogue wave slammed into his boat, knocking him into the sea, but in the end he survived by eating raw fish. 'I'm a fisherman so I caught fish; it wasn't as good as a sushi bar, but that's how I hydrated,' he said. A Coast Guard cutter towed his crippled 25-foot sailboat, the Malia, back to its port in Kaunakakai. Mr Ingraham celebrated on land with a cigarette with his friend Dedric Manaba. Mr Manaba's wife told the Los Angeles Times that despite his ordeal Mr Ingraham looked well when he arrived at the shore on Wednesday. 'He is a man of very few words,' she said. 'He hugged everyone and thanked everyone and just kept on walking.' 'We are happy that he was found. We are very excited that we are able to provide some positive closure,' Coast Guard spokesman Lt. Scott Carr told the Los Angeles Times. 'It was a really tough decision to suspend the search.' Mr Ingraham's crippled 25-foot sailboat, the Malia, after it was found by a Navy destroyer, 64 miles out to sea . Mr Ingraham, an experienced fisherman, was sailing alone from Kaunakakai Harbor to Manele Bay on Lanai on November 27, Thanksgiving Day - a journey that should have put him no more than five miles from land at any time. But something went horribly wrong. On the day he left, he sent out two distress signals that his boat was taking on water. The Coast Guard pinpointed his message as coming 46 miles west of Kailua-Kona - dramatically off his course. The Coast Guard mounted a massive search effort - flying 59 airborne missions with MH-65 Dolphin helicopter crews and HC-130 Hercules airplane crews. However, the distress signal went dark and planes and helicopters found no signs of Ingraham's boat. This video from a Coast Guard seaplane shows US Navy crewmen providing aid to the crippled Malia . Mr Ingraham sent a distress call far off course - and was found 80 miles from his original mayday signal . On December 1, Coast Guard commanders called off the search effort after failing to find Ingraham. Then, nine days later, he resurfaced with a  mayday call. A Coast Guard post picked up the distress signal and pinpointed it 64 miles south of Oahu - or about 80 miles from his first distress call. A Navy destroyer, the USS Paul Hamilton was nearby and rushed to Mr Ingraham's aid. Both his main masts had snapped and the outboard motor was mangled. He was sailing under the power of a tiny auxiliary sail, attempting to make it back to land. 'I thought, well at least dad died doing what he loved,' Zakary said. 'I was trying to emotionally quell myself. But at the same time, I kind of had that feeling he wasn't gone yet.' Now the memorial service that had been planned in Kaunakakai to mourn Ingraham's death has been revised. It's not a welcome home party. 'We're going to turn it into a celebration instead of a funeral,' his friend Chris Connor told KITV. Mr Ingraham's 25-foot sailboat, the Malia, had both masts snapped and the outboard motor mangled. It was towed back to his home port . The Navy destroyer the USS Paul Hamilton happened to be just 14 miles from the Malia when the new distress signal came in. It rushed over and rescued the sailor .","Ron Ingraham, 67, was blown off course while sailing on Thanksgiving day .

"Claims: Neil Hamilton stepped down from Ukip selection tonight as it emerged he was facing questions over expenses he allegedly claimed for staying at wife Christine's flat . Neil Hamilton stepped down from Ukip selection tonight as it emerged he was facing questions over expenses claims he made as deputy chairman of the party. The former Tory MP is under scrutiny from the Ukip finance committee over expenses he allegedly claimed for staying at his wife Christine's London flat. Details of the expenses claims emerged in a leaked letter before Mr Hamilton told party members at a hustings meeting in Essex that he would not be standing for election there. He had been one of five candidates in the running to become Ukip's candidate for the seat of South Basildon and East Thurrock. Mr Hamilton made the announcement before hustings began at the meeting, saying he had only stood because a local councillor, Kerry Smith, had been deselected as the party's prospective parliamentary candidate for the seat in October, only to be later reinstated. Announcing his decision to step aside and backing of Mr Smith, Mr Hamilton told the BBC: 'He should never has been deselected in the first place, in my opinion, and he will make an excellent member of parliament for Basildon.' 'I would not have put my hat into the ring if I'd known that Kerry was going to be a candidate. 'I didn't know until I got here that his name was included in the ballot paper.' Mr Smith was later selected for the seat. Last month, Mr Hamilton withdrew from the race to become UKIP's candidate for Boston and Skegness. In response to the leaked letter, Mr Hamilton lashed out at party insiders over a 'dirty tricks' campaign being run against him. And he called for the party's national executive committee (NEC) to take action against those involved in the 'black arts of selective briefing, misrepresentation and outright lies'. Tonight, Channel 4 News political correspondent Michael Crick revealed that Mr Hamilton had been sent a letter asking him to explain 'each and ever mileage claim' he has made, as well as details on lunches. He was also asked to provide 'an explanation of each stay that has been charged for your wife's flat detailing why it was more convenient for you to stay there, rather than at your house'. Mr Hamilton was also asked to state why he charged VAT on his salary from the party during his time as campaign manager in the run-up to the European elections, a job the letter said he was subsequently 'removed' from. The letter, leaked to Channel 4 News, said the committee had been told that the arrangement had not been agreed. 'We have seen the email trail and would like an explanation as to why you did not go back to those who agreed this salary and why you did not make it known that you intended to charge VAT on your salary by charging Ukip through a company for your services as this incurred Ukip in extra costs. 'It is accepted that Ukip would have had to pay employer's NI which is substantially less than VAT. Scroll down for video . Stepping down: Details of the expenses claims emerged before Hamilton told party members at a hustings meeting in Essex that he would not be standing for election there . 'What is wrong here, is that you failed to go back to the management committee to clear the arrangement knowing that Ukip was at all times during this campaign short of money.' The letter, which was sent today, signed off by telling Mr Hamilton: 'Please do bear in mind that we receive at Lexdrum House handwritten letters from pensioners enclosing a £5 or a £10 note which they have managed to save so as to send it to Ukip and hence we need to make sure that all expenses are fully explainable.' Mr Hamilton said tonight that Mr Crick had seen the letter before he had. 'It is sad that some people in UKIP have adopted the black arts of selective briefing, misrepresentation and outright lies which Ukip rightly excoriates in the LibLabCon,' he said. 'It is time for the NEC, directly elected by the Party's hard-working members, to cut out this cancer at the heart of Ukip which undermines its integrity.' Mr Hamilton said he had predicted the correspondence about his expenses would be leaked and insisted he had been given assurances the inquiry into claims was a general one, rather than targeted at him. He said: 'Andrew Reid's letter was written this afternoon and leaked to C4's Michael Crick before I had even seen it. Response: Mr Hamilton lashed out at party insiders over a 'dirty tricks' campaign being run against him . 'The correspondence of which it is part, and which explains my position, has not been leaked and, therefore, a deliberately misleading view has been created, calculated to inflict maximum damage on me.' He added: 'The assistant treasurer of Ukip explicitly said to me at the outset that the expenses inquiry is general and not specific to me, arises because Ukip is short of funds and that there was no suggestion of any impropriety on my part. 'The demand now for receipts, when I was explicitly told they were not necessary, may have been in included in this letter to convey an impression of malpractice on my part. 'There are no grounds whatsoever of suspecting me of any impropriety. 'Certain individuals have axes to grind against me and this is part of their continuing dirty tricks campaign. 'Only a small handful of people could have leaked this letter and a glance at the names should make it perfectly obvious who the culprit or culprits are likely to be. 'I have worked selflessly to advance UKIP's interest for 12 years, entirely at my own expense until I became a party employee as European campaign director on September 1, 2013, an appointment which ceased on May 31, 2014 since when I have been unpaid but entitled to my expenses.' Mr Hamilton's bid to stand for Ukip in South Basildon and East Thurrock followed the withdrawal of Natasha Bolter from the race. She had been embroiled in a row over claims of sexual harassment against a senior Ukip official, who has subsequently been suspended. General secretary Roger Bird insisted he was not a 'predator' and was confident a full party inquiry would clear his name. He published a file of personal messages which he says show he was in a relationship with Ms Bolter. She says she felt pressured to sleep with the man overseeing candidate approvals in order to further her potential career in the Eurosceptic outfit. Ms Bolter - who defected from Labour in a blaze of publicity and was introduced on stage at this year's Ukip conference by Mr Bird - said that although he propositioned her, he was a 'gentleman' when she declined. Decision: Mr Hamilton's bid to stand for Ukip in South Basildon followed the withdrawal of Natasha Bolter (left) from the race after she was embroiled in a row over claims of sexual harassment against General secretary Roger Bird (right), who has since been suspended . Mr Bird, who is single, insists however that they enjoyed a six-week consensual, sexual relationship that began a week after she had been approved to join the approved candidates list. The former Conservative councillor, who quit the Tories in 2009 and switched to Ukip the following year, released part of what he said was a large collection of emails, texts and photographs which backed his side of the story. He said the liaison began 'some time after' the candidate assessment and was ended by him on November 2. Among the messages he said were received from Ms Bolter, one read: 'But I love u and miss u and think u r sort of perfect.' Another, apparently referring to the close of the Ukip conference in Doncaster, read: 'R u still cool with me leaving suitcase here and coming home with u? Xx.' Others expressed sentiments such as 'really missing u bird', 'U r not coming back and accordingly my life will go back to a meaningless void"" and ""U r a really great mentor bird'. 'Natasha Bolter and I were in a consensual relationship. This took place some time after her candidate assessment,' Mr Bird said. 'All of the suggestions that I was being some kind of predator and all the rest of it is entirely unsubstantiated by the facts.' Ms Bolter agreed that she had sent a series of messages but told BBC2's Newsnight: 'None of them changes my story.' 'I did not sleep with Roger Bird, end of,' she said. In an interview for the programme, she said: 'When I said no, nothing happened. He's a gentleman. 'I never felt scared of him, I just felt pressured maybe, that if I did the right thing my career would go faster and further."" 'He wasn't taking me seriously as a candidate; he was looking at me as a sex object.' She said the issue could have been dealt with by way of a 'tap on the wrist' if the party had acted more swiftly, and both parties continued. But she suggested it was part of a wider issue. 'We need to look at it in the greater picture: if they are not looking after a candidate that is going to stand in one of their target seats who is bringing forward serious allegations of sexism and racism and misogyny, are they really going to look after our electorate.' Mr Bird said he 'really could not even hazard a guess' at why she might wish to invent a claim against him. 'I suspect that perhaps she's fallen out of love with Ukip for reasons unconnected to me,' he said.","Former Tory MP is under scrutiny from the Ukip finance committee .

"A pervert with a foot fetish was said to have targeted a middle-aged woman as she sat quietly reading in a library, a court heard. Luke Rudge reportedly seized the horrified woman's leg and started to kiss her feet, after crawling under the library table. The 33-year-old was then said to have picked up her discarded boots and started to smell them for his own sexual gratification. Luke Rudge, 33, reportedly pounced on the middle-aged woman as she sat reading at Leamington Spa Library . Rudge, who had previous convictions for sexual offences, admitted a single charge of sexual assault at Warwick Crown Court, the Coventry Telegraph reported. The newspaper said the woman kicked off her boots as she sat reading in Leamington Spa Library in Warwickshire on November 7. Rudge reportedly made her feel 'uncomfortable' after telling her that she had beautiful legs and feet. When she apparently ignored him, he lay down on the library floor, grabbed her legs and started to kiss her feet. Moments later Rudge stopped and was then said to have picked up the woman's boots and started to smell them, while complimenting her on her feet. He was reportedly arrested after the woman alerted library staff, who raised the alarm. Rudge was previously jailed for four years in 2011 for indecently assaulting a 14-year-old girl in a park, Warwick Crown Court was told. It was said in his defence, that he accepted he had a problem and was desperate to have access to help. Judge Alan Parker handed Rudge an extended prison sentence and jailed him for 14 months, the Coventry Telegraph reported. He was said to have been told that after his release he will be on licence for eight years and be subject to a recall to prison.

"The star Ukip candidate accusing one of Nigel Farage's closets allies of being a sex pest was facing further embarrassing revelations tonight - after her claim to have been a teacher was thrown into doubt. Natasha Bolter was introduced to the Ukip conference earlier this year as a Labour defector who had gone into teaching after a stellar education culminating in a degree from Oxford University. But her claim to have read politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford unravelled yesterday when the institution took the rare step of denying she had ever attended. It then emerged today that she was only a ‘cover supervisor’ at a comprehensive school in east London - and not a teacher - as Ukip supporters were led to believe. Mrs Bolter, seen above leaving her home, misspelt her supposed Oxford alma mater Wadham College as ‘Wadam’ on her CV – and said she was aged 35, rather than 39 . In fact Ms Bolter had not worked at any school in the borough since Spring 2013, a spokesman for Barking and Dagenham council told the Telegraph. It also emerged today that she did not ‘defect’ from Labour – and was in fact thrown out for failing to pay her membership fees. Ms Bolter's decision to quit Ed Miliband's party was hailed as a major coup for Ukip. But the divorced mother-of-five was only a Labour member for just eight months, party sources confirmed. The revelations came after the Mail learnt she even misspelt her supposed Oxford alma mater Wadham College as ‘Wadam’ on her CV – and said she was aged 35, rather than 39. Mrs Bolter claims she was sexually harassed by Roger Bird, one of Nigel Farage’s key lieutenants. Mr Bird has said the pair were in a relationship. Mrs Bolter told the BBC’s Newsnight: ‘I didn’t sleep with Roger Bird, end of.’ But he insisted: ‘For the record, yes she did.’ Yesterday it emerged she sent him flirty text messages two days after the harassment claims were made. One said: ‘Love or infatuation made me lose my brain.’ Roger Bird said he was in a relationship with Mrs Bolter, who denied she had slept with him. She was a dream candidate for male-dominated Ukip because she is female, the daughter of immigrants and a former Labour supporter. But she exploded a grenade in the party by claiming in The Times that Mr Bird had propositioned her at his club. On Monday, Ukip said Mr Bird had been suspended while it looked at claims of ‘impropriety’. At Ukip’s September conference, Mr Bird introduced Mrs Bolter, saying: ‘She got five A grades at A-levels and went on to read PPE at Wadham College, Oxford.’ She repeated the Oxford claims in an unpublished interview with The Times, it is understood. But the university said it could find no evidence Mrs Bolter – then Natasha Ahmed – was a student. It said: ‘Oxford University has no record of a Natasha Ahmed with a birthday of 12 July 1975.’ Last night a friend said she did study in Oxford – on a teaching course at the now-defunct Westminster Institute of Education at Oxford Brookes University.","Natasha Bolter accused Ukip chief executive of being a sex pest .

"Maoist sect leader Aravindan Balakrishnan investigated over allegations of slavery has been charged with 25 counts of offences including rape . A Maoist sect leader investigated arrested over allegations of slavery a year ago has been charged with 25 counts of offences including rape, police said. Aravindan Balakrishnan, 74, is also accused of crimes including false imprisonment, indecent assault and cruelty to a child under 16. Balakrishnan, who was arrested in Lambeth, south London, in November last year, faces one count of cruelty to a person under the age of 16, one count of false imprisonment, 19 counts of indecent assault and four counts of rape. He is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court in London on December 17. The offences relate to three women - 30-year-old Briton, a 57-year-old Irishwoman and a 69-year-old Malaysian -  and span a period between January 1980 and October 2013. Balakrishnan, known as 'Comrade Bala,' led an obscure Maoist collective in the late 1970s. He was arrested in November along with his wife, who was later released without charge. Police said the suspect shared a political ideology with three other inhabitants, who were allegedly held in a London house for decades. Anthony Connell, senior prosecutor at the Crown Prosecution Service, said: 'The CPS has today authorised the police to charge Aravindan Balakrishnan with a number of charges including false imprisonment, cruelty to a person under 16 years, indecent assault and rape. 'After careful consideration we have decided that there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and that a prosecution is in the public interest.' In November his wife, Chanda Pattni, 67, was told she would not be prosecuted over the allegations after nearly a year on bail. The case made headlines when Balakrishnan and Ms Pattni were arrested in November last year, after one of the women rang a charity claiming she had been held against her will, sparking a police inquiry.

Another of the two alleged victims are pictured . Police said three women, then aged 69, 57 and 30, had been living in the house as part of a political 'collective'. Described as a 'guru', Balakrishnan set up a communist squat, the Mao Zedong Memorial Centre, in Brixton in 1976 where the couple ran their group, the Workers' Institute of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Tse Tung Thought, holding lectures and film evenings. He had been kicked out of the Communist Party's national executive after his faction 'attempted to put themselves above the discipline of the party'. Officers from the Metropolitan Police's human trafficking unit said at the time that the case was 'completely unique' in their experience. After raiding the house, police removed 55 bags of evidence and 12,500 exhibits, but admitted the 'complexity' of the case meant it would take a long time to investigate.

"Nick Barnfield and Sarah Cleaves said they were trying to settle their daughter Heidi on the bus when they were approached 'aggressively' A couple were thrown off a bus and branded racists after singing the Peppa Pig theme tune to their autistic daughter, it has been claimed. Nick Barnfield and Sarah Cleaves were travelling with their daughter Heidi on a bus from Sheffield to Doncaster when the 15-month-old started crying. The couple, who live in Rotherham, started singing the song in an effort to cheer their daughter up, but say they were branded racists by another passenger and told to get off the bus by its driver. The couple claimed the woman, who they say was wearing a hijab, took offence to the snorting sounds in the song and believed they were a reference to how pork is forbidden in Islam though this has not been confirmed. She complained to the bus's driver, who, it is claimed, then told the couple it would be 'easier' for them to get off two miles from their home. 'We were really embarrassed, ashamed and upset and we hadn't done anything wrong, just trying to make our little girl happy, but people were looking at us as if we had done something wrong. 'It was humiliating,' said Mr Branfield. The 24-year-old said they were trying to settle their daughter on the X78 bus on September 8 when they were approached  'aggressively' by the woman. 'A lady came up to us and quite aggressively started telling us we were irresponsible parents and that we were being racist singing the song.' 'She went up to the bus driver and told him we were being racist towards her and she wasn’t happy. The driver came up to me and said we had to get off the bus or the police would have to come. 'He said: 'just get off the bus - it’s not worth the hassle’. I was really shocked because we had done nothing wrong but he didn't listen to us. 'He just said: ""Go now, otherwise you’ll hold up all the passengers and no-one will be happy.""' 'I was more upset at the bus driver not taking in both sides - he just heard the word racism and kicked us off. 'I’m annoyed he didn't listen to our side of the story or ask any questions.' Mr Barnfield said he and his fiancee were 'humiliated' after allegedly being asked to get off the bus . The couple said they began singing the song to their 15-month-old daughter Heidi and made snorting sounds . The couple claim to have been thrown off the X78 bus from Sheffield to Doncaster following the incident . A spokesman for First confirmed the couple did get off the bus following a conversation with a female Asian passenger and the bus driver, but claimed the bus driver had no knowledge of allegations of racism. 'CCTV confirms that Mr Branfield had left the bus as he described and it does clearly show a conversation between the driver, a female Asian customer and the customer Mr Branfield who has logged the complaint with us. 'In terms of what was said we are investigating it and we're in discussions with Mr Branfield. 'We're looking at the circumstances in which he left the vehicle - I don't want to speculate about his concerns that he was asked to leave but we want to be clear from both sides what happened. 'The driver told us he heard no reference to racism but we are investigating the incident and have not yet drawn a conclusion.' South Yorkshire Police said it was not investigating the incident.

"Police say an unemployed couple facing eviction admitted swiping a Salvation Army donation bucket from a Pittsburgh-area convenience store so they could use the cash to buy drugs. Joshua Basinger and Rachel Pecharka were arrested on Tuesday in McDonald, Pennsylvania, and charged with theft, receiving stolen property and criminal conspiracy.

"More than 750 schools are failing to give pupils a good grounding in the Three Rs - reading, writing and arithmetic. A child's chance of getting a good primary education still varies markedly depending on where they live, official statistics showed today. Ministers insisted it was the result of tougher targets to improve the quality of lessons in England, and stressed that the gap between poorer pupils and their classmates is narrowing. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan is under pressure to improve standards in reading, writing and arithmetic . In some areas of England, the vast majority of youngsters gain a Level 4 - the standard expected of 11-year-olds in the Three Rs. But in other areas, up to three in 10 fail to reach this target. Overall, the proportion of primaries failing to ensure pupils reach a good standard in three Rs has remained static this year, despite schools facing tougher Government targets. More than 700 schools in England are considered below the floor standard, the same proportion as last year, according to a Government analysis of data used to create primary school league tables. Schools minister David Laws said the findings show schools have 'raised their game', but warned there are still too many areas with 'simply unacceptable' levels of attainment for poorer pupils. Schools that fail to meet the benchmark - based on national curriculum test results at age 11 and pupil progress - are considered under-performing and at risk of being turned into an academy, or taken over by a different sponsor or trust if they already have academy status. The Department for Education's analysis shows wide variations across the country, with no schools under-performing in some areas while in others, significant proportions are below the Government's target. In one area, more than a quarter of primaries are considered to be under the threshold. Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw has demanded schools drive up standards to help poor children achieve their potential . Under the Government's tougher standards, schools must ensure at least 65 per cent of 11-year-olds reach Level 4 - the standard expected of the age group - in reading, writing and maths, and meet national averages in pupil progress. Children working at Level 4 are considered able to spell, use joined-up handwriting, are beginning to use complex sentences, can calculate simple fractions and percentages and can multiply and divide whole numbers by 10 and 100. Overall, 768 schools failed to meet the floor standard this year, compared with 767 last year, the DfE said. The new rankings are based on the performance of around 16,000 primaries in national curriculum tests - known as Sats - in reading and maths, as well as teacher assessments of pupils' writing skills. The results also show the top primary school again this year, based on average points score, was Fox Primary School in Kensington and Chelsea, west London. Overall, 79 per cent of 11-year-olds achieved the expected standard in all three areas this year, up three percentage points .","Schools should ensure 65% of 11-year-olds achieve Level 4 in 'three Rs'

"It may have a reputation as the digital currency of choice for some unsavoury online deals, but Bitcoin is about to become more mainstream. Gamers and phone owners can use the currency to buy Xbox titles as well as apps for devices running Windows Phone. While no official announcement has been made, Microsoft has created a webpage that explains how the currency can be used to top up a Microsoft account. Bitcoins (illustrated) can be used to buy Xbox games as well as apps for Windows Phones. While there was no official announcement, a webpage explains how the currency can be used to top up Microsoft accounts . However, Bitcoins can only be used to load money into a Microsoft wallet, rather than make direct payments, TechCrunch noted. At the moment, Bitcoins can be added to US-based accounts, and have to be purchased in specific amounts, such as $10, $15, $25, $50, $75 and $100. Commenting on whether the payment option will be rolled out to the UK, a Microsoft spokesman told MailOnline: 'Initially, only customers with a US commerce account will be able to use the service. 'We’ll look to possibly expand the program in the future, but have nothing further to share at this time.' Microsoft is the latest large company to adopt the digital currency, which is becoming increasingly mainstream. Customers can already use it to pay for goods via Paypal, Dell and Expedia, among others. The move has been greeted enthusiastically by many Bitcoin users. At the moment, Bitcoins can only be used to load money into a Microsoft wallet, rather than make direct payments, but this means that people can buy apps for Windows Phones, games for Xbox and Microsoft software (shown) using the virtual currency . Bitcoin operates as a two-way currency which can be exchanged for dollars, and vice versa. The notion behind it is to facilitate cheap, anonymous transactions policed by its community of users and is built around trust rather than relying on institutions like governments or banks. Bitcoin's status as a digital currency is debatable. It is entirely a digital product but is not regulated and it has a limit of 21million, which is predicted to last until 2140. The finite nature of Bitcoins means it performs more like a commodity, such as gold. Bitcoin first emerged in 2008 and launched as a network in 2009. It was created by a hacker whose identity is a mystery, but is known as Satoshi Nakamoto. This is thought to be a pseudonym for the person or group who created it. Each Bitcoin is a piece of computer code that has been generated through very slow computer processing, also known as 'mining'. Users choose a virtual wallet from one of the various providers which enables them to receive, give and trade coins from other users. Bitcoin's can be bought from specialist online currency exchanges and online marketplaces such as eBay. One member of Reddit’s bitcoin community posted: ‘It's getting harder and harder for people to think [Bitcoin is] dead/dying/irrelevant/scam/illegal'. Another said: ‘Really ace move. 'It's clear that under the new CEO, MS has really tried to up its “developer image”, become a bit more indie and a bit less corporate. ‘But I hadn't expected some senior manager at MS payments to OK this one this soon, before companies like Google or Steam.’ Satya Nadella, became the company’s CEO in February and since then, has focused on services across Microsoft’s different platforms. The firm's willingness to take embrace Bitcoin - ahead of Google and Apple - may help it shed its slow and lumbering corporate image. The company was a latecomer to the smartphone and tablet market, for example. It was reported in June that Apple was making a move to accept Bitcoin, but this has yet to be confirmed. A summer update to the App Store Review Guidelines hinted at the plants when it began allowing apps to accept the virtual currency. The policy now claims: ‘Apps may facilitate transmission of approved virtual currencies provided that they do so in compliance with all state and federal laws for the territories in which the app functions.’ This means Bitcoin could be used for downloads or in-app purchases from the Apple App Store.","Microsoft has not officially announced the move, but a webpage outlines how the currency can be used to top up a Microsoft account .

"Home Office staff have given British passports to tens of thousands of illegal immigrants and foreign criminals - including at least one murderer, a damning report revealed yesterday. Officials have failed to carry out even basic checks on more than 200,000 migrants applying for British citizenship every year, it said. The shambles allowed criminals and others with ‘very poor immigration histories’ to obtain a passport – allowing them access to the jobs market, benefits and public services. Inspectors unearthed one case in which staff accepted an application from an asylum-seeker – unaware that he had admitted a fatal stabbing in his homeland. Chief border inspector John Vine discovered an asylum seeker who admitted to immigration officials that they had stabbed someone to death in their home country but was still allowed to become a British citizen . Of the 235,000 applications in 2013, the refusal rate was only 3 per cent – three times lower than in 2007. And with two million passports handed out over the past decade, critics said the potential scale of the scandal is enormous – with up to 12,000 cases being wrongly approved every year. Last night the Home Office was frantically working to withdraw the citizenship granted to the killer. Mr Vine’s report – which was handed to Home Secretary Theresa May on September 1 but only released by the Home Office yesterday – found rules were routinely ignored. He said ‘no attempts’ were made to check an applicant’s criminal record. Bizarrely, if an applicant volunteered information about a conviction, it was ignored if the Home Office could not independently verify the information. There were ‘virtually no other checks’ to establish the good character of applicants, the inspection found. Rules state that those seeking citizenship must not breach British immigration laws at any time during the five years leading up to their application, unless there are exceptional circumstances. Border inspectors discovered violent killers were among thousands of immigrants with ‘very poor’ records who have been granted British citizenship . The report by chief inspector of borders John Vine found that: . But officials were routinely ignoring a poor history of evading controls – such as entering Britain illegally or working without permission – a ‘blanket policy’ that was applied without ministerial approval. Officials also took a lax attitude to those caught cheating the rules or who were bankrupt. In one case, officials made the ‘very poor decision’ not to revoke the citizenship of someone who used forged documents. There were also ‘significant delays’ in dealing with allegations concerning deception. The report heaps huge new pressure on Theresa May after a string of scandals involving foreign criminals and border failures. Mr Vine claims a string of damning reports have been suppressed and is standing down at the end of the year, apparently in protest. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper accused Mrs May of ‘sitting on the report for months’ and called on her to reveal exact numbers of those awarded citizenship without proper checks. She added: ‘When Home Office failures allow murderers to get British citizenship the Home Secretary should take action and not seek to manage the bad news.’ Campaign group MigrationWatch called the situation a ‘shambles’. Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons home affairs committee, called the ‘shocking’ report the ‘most damming I have seen emanate from the chief inspector’s office’. Immigration and security minister James Brokenshire said the Government was still clearing up the ‘mess’ it inherited – including Labour’s decision in 2007 to grant large numbers the right to remain in Britain indefinitely even if they did not meet the rules. Migrants who have flouted immigration laws will now be banned from becoming British citizens for at least ten years, he announced. A spokesman for Number Ten called the case of the foreign killer being granted citizenship ‘regrettable’. To get hold of a British passport, a migrant first needs to gain citizenship. To qualify for that first stage, applicants must be of ‘good character, able to communicate in English and not have been in breach of immigration rules while living in the UK’. In recent years, migrants’ English has been tested by requiring them to sit an exam or sitting the ‘Life in the UK’ test – a multiple choice quiz on British history, laws and public services. The final decision is taken by the Home Office’s Nationality Casework team – which is the department inspected by John Vine for yesterday’s devastating report. Once approved, the applicant is expected to attend a citizenship ceremony and swear an oath of allegiance to the Queen. Citizenship gives full access to Britain’s jobs market, benefits and state services. The rules on British citizenship are supposedly strict to reflect the huge rights and benefits it conveys. But, with passports being handed out at a record rate of more than 200,000 every year, it has also turned into a huge money-spinner for the Home Office. On average, the cost of processing an application is £144. The cost to a migrant of applying is £906 – a profit of £762. In 2013, the Home Office raked in £152million dealing with citizenship claims.","Chief borders inspector says 'no attempts' made to check criminal records .

"The mother of Sophie Lancaster, a woman murdered in 2007 because of her Gothic looks, has said her OBE is a 'validation' for all those young people targeted for looking or dressing differently. Sylvia Lancaster, who founded the Sophie Lancaster Foundation in her daughter’s memory, was honoured by the Prince of Wales earlier today for her work in stamping out hate crimes. 'He talked about Sophie, actually, and about gang culture,' a delighted Mrs Lancaster said after the ceremony. Proud: Sylvia Lancaster, mother of murdered Sophie, shows off her OBE following the investiture ceremony . Tragic: Sophie Lancaster was just 20 when she was beaten to death by a gang of teenagers . 'I’m sure she would be proud. To be here, and we can talk about it, can’t we? - You’re here in Buckingham Palace - it’s very special ... 'It’s not just about the work that we do, it’s a validation of the work that we do and of the alternative subcultures as well.' Mrs Lancaster said she was touched that Prince Charles knew about her 20-year-old daughter's tragic death in 2007. Miss Lancaster was with her boyfriend Rob Maltby, 21, when she was set upon by drunk teenagers in a park in Bacup, Lancashire. The gang turned on her and Mr Maltby, who survived the attack, because of their alternative appearance. Horrifically, Miss Lancaster was kicked and stamped on while she knelt on the ground, cradling the injured Mr Maltby. Both fell into comas but Miss Lancaster, a gap-year student, never regained consciousness and died in hospital 13 days later. Goths are not often seen at Buckingham Palace, but Mrs Lancaster wanted to add a touch of her late daughter’s style for her audience with the Prince. 'I’ve got a velvet bag with a skull on it and that’s because it represents the subcultures, and I wanted to bring them with me,' said Mrs Lancaster, who also sported black and silver nail polish. 'That’s my thing. And my funky nails. When I was younger I was always quite different, but I really never had the balls to dress like that. But I like the touches.' Heartbreaking: Although Sophie died, her boyfriend Rob Maltby, 21, did survive the appalling attack . Sympathetic: Prince Charles, pictured at an earlier event with Camilla, passed on his sympathies . Proud: Others to be honoured by Prince Charles included Andrea Fox MBE and Dr Rosemary Butcher MBE . Delighted: Newly minted CBE Sunita Mason holds up her award following the investiture ceremony . She said she hoped her charity, which aims to challenge prejudices towards people from alternative subcultures and campaigns on hate crime legislation, would offer troubled youngsters hope. 'We got a letter, probably last week, from a dad whose daughter was being bullied in school - the kids had even given her razor blades,' Mrs Lancaster said. 'Her dad was saying ""Thankfully there’s someone we can talk to, and you have made it easier"" - that there is somebody who’ll listen.' Mrs Lancaster also revealed that she has stayed in touch with Mr Maltby, who has spent the years since the attack rebuilding his life. 'Rob should be allowed to get on with his own life,' she said. 'Thankfully he is doing that.'","Sophie Lancaster was 20 when she was murdered in a 2007 gang attack .

"Alan Turing, who was instrumental in cracking the Nazi Enigma code, was found dead in 1954 at the age of 41 - reportedly from suicide . Code-breaking genius Alan Turing - played by Benedict Cumberbatch in hit film The Imitation Game - was murdered, a new book claims. The brilliant mathematician who cracked Hitler's Engima wartime code machines was found dead in 1954 at the age of 41. Author Roger Bristow claims a note from the pathologist casts doubt over the official conclusion of suicide. The post mortem report said he died from cyanide poisoning, but the note adds that: 'Death appears to be due to violence.' Mr. Bristow, a former mayor who has spent almost 30 years researching Turing and his work at Bletchley Park, said he was carrying out secret work before his death. He believes the code-cracker was killed by the FBI because he had information that would be 'extremely damaging or embarrassing.' Mr Bristow adds that Turing had been working on the top secret operation Verona, deciphering wartime radio signals to identify  Russian agents in the United States. He describes how some of the agents managed to get themselves into highly prominent positions, with one even becoming a personal assistant to President Roosevelt. Turing, who was prosecuted for being gay, was found dead in his bedroom in Wilmslow, Cheshire in June 1954. Two years earlier he had been convicted of gross indecency and sentenced to chemical castration. A post mortem found traces of potassium cyanide in his body - a substance he used for his chemical experiments. Mr Bristow, a founder member of Bletchley Park Trust and former Milton Keynes mayor, said: 'I believe he was killed, perhaps by the FBI, and his death was made to look like a suicide. Alan Turing's incredible life and work at Bletchley Park in World War II has been portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch (pictured) in The Imitation Game . Cumberbatch  plays the genius mathematician, opposite co-stars Keira Knightley, Matthew Beard, Matthew Goode and Allen Leech (pictured in a scene from the film), as he cracks the Nazi Enigma code -  a major factor in the Battle of the Atlantic . 'My theory is that he had stumbled upon some information that could be extremely damaging or embarrassing to certain people in America. 'His body was found on the Tuesday morning and he was buried by Wednesday afternoon. How could proper tests have been conducted in that time? 'Also there is no evidence he was depressed before his death. In fact there are reports from neighbours that he seemed cheerful. 'But the final sentence on the pathologist report says it all: 'Death appears to be due to violence.' Turing, played by Cumberbatch, dances with Joan Clarke- a cryptanalist at Bletchley Park, played by Keira Knightly, in The Imitation Game . 'We, as a nation, need that sentence explained before we can accept that one of our greatest heroes was not a victim of murder.' Turing received a royal pardon from the Queen last year and in 2009 Prime Minister Gordon Brown officially apologised on behalf of the British government for 'the appalling way he was treated' Mr. Bristow is now attempting to find a publisher for his manuscript 'Boffins, Bombs, Boats and Balloons'.","The Code-breaking genius was found dead in 1954 at the age of 41 .

"TV food experts have clashed over new £200million EU red tape rules which force restaurants to provide details of any dishes containing one or more of 14 different allergens. From Saturday, restaurants will be required to identify which of their dishes contain the allergens, which range from gluten to soya, milk, mustard, sesame, lupin and sulphur dioxide. Prue Leith has described the changes as a bureaucratic nightmare, while the former chairman of the Restaurant Association, the Earl of Bradford, says the rules are ridiculously complicated. New rules forcing restaurants to provide details of dishes containing one or more allergens from a list of 14 will be introduced on Saturday. It is thought the regime will create a punishing bill of £200million for industry . However, the TV chef Aldo Zilli supports the new regime and claims that any chefs who complain are guilty of laziness. The industry estimates the new rules have created a punishing bill of £200million for restaurants and the catering industry in order to help the tiny minority of people who have an allergy. Just two per cent of the nation are believed to have a diagnosed food allergy, according to research by the Food Standards Agency, which equates to around two million people. Restaurants, cafes, fast food outlets and caterers providing meals in schools, hospitals, prisons and offices have had to check all their ingredients, train staff and create manuals spelling out which dishes contain which allergens. The British Hospitality Association said the changes have created enormous upheaval, particularly for small restaurants and cafes. A spokesman said: ‘The challenge will be greatest for restaurants who frequently change recipe or menu items; pop­up or event caterers; establishments with high staff turnover; and smaller establishments who may struggle with the resources to track, identify and record all allergens used from main dishes through to garnishes and drinks. TV chef's have clashed over new rules including Prue Leith (left) who branded it as a 'bureaucratic nightmare' while Aldo Zilli supports the new regime and claims that any chefs who complain are guilty of laziness . ‘As a result, we calculate that it could cost the industry up to £200 million per year to implement new sourcing and management processes, adapt menus and websites and regularly brief and train staff.’ Prue Leith, the renowned cook and TV food expert, fears the changes will create red tape and make it very difficult for small restaurants to change their menus and offer a ‘dish of the day’. She said: ‘My worry is that it will kill innovation and experimentation in the kitchen and cooking what is available daily in the market. Soya, eggs, milk and peanuts are among the list of 14 allergens that must be identified under new rules . ‘Fine for formula restaurant chains which never change their menus and have bureaucrats to work out how any milligrams of anything a dish has, but for proper cooks - a nightmare.’ But, Mr Zilli said: ‘I don’t agree. I really can’t see how it will kill innovation, how can that happen? ‘We change our menus every season. You can still create what you wish and be a chef as long as you tell customers what ingredients you are using. ‘There is laziness in this industry and it is about time we stopped that. We as chefs have to become more responsible for what we are feeding our customers.’ Mr Zilli said his own wife has an allergy to gluten, while family members have suffered reactions to dishes served in restaurants. He is consultant executive chef for the chain of San Carlo Cicchetti restaurants, which has spent months going through recipes to identify any use of the allergens. The chain has re-trained its chefs and created files for each dish on the menu, which can be consulted by waiting staff if a customer has a question about the use of the allergens. Mr Zilli said the process has involved a great deal of time and expense, however he insisted the changes are necessary to protect the health of customers. The former chairman of the Restaurant Association, Richard Bridgeman, who is 7th Earl of Bradford and runs Porters in Covent Garden, said the new allergen rules are well intentioned. But, he complained: ‘It is typical of the heavy-handedness of the EU to bring in something like this. It is ridiculously complicated and almost impossible for most restaurants to comply with. ‘You have to audit every menu item, but also, if you buy in sauces, for example, you need to go to the supplier and get the allergen details from them, which is difficult and complicated.’ Richard Bridgeman, 7th Earl of Bradford and restaurateur, said new rules are 'ridiculously complicated' The new rules will also apply to products sold in supermarkets where the allergens will have to be identified in bold type on the nutrition labels. In a separate move stores will be required to offer clearer information on the origin of fresh meat. Details on where pigs, sheep and poultry are reared and slaughtered for raw meat sale will have to be on the label. The Food Standards Agency says the new allergen rules will provide a lifeline to the estimated two million people in this country who suffer from allergies. 1. Gluten containing cereals . 2. Crustaceans . 3. Molluscs . 4. Fish . 5. Peanuts . 6. Lupin . 7. Tree Nuts (such as walnut, hazelnut, almond etc.) 8. Soya . 9. Eggs . 10. Milk . 11. Celery . 12. Mustard . 13. Sesame . 14. Sulphur dioxide . Its research found that seven in 10 of those with allergies avoid buying takeaways, due to fears about allergen. More than half of those with allergies – 53 per cent - said they avoided eating in restaurants for the same reason. Restaurants and cafes have been given flexibility on how they provide allergy information. This can be communicated verbally through explanations by staff or signposted to where or how more information can be found on menus or in leaflets. Allergy expert at the FSA Chun-Han Chan, said: ‘With a steady rise in the number of people suffering from food allergies and intolerances in the last decade, these new measures will make it simpler for those with allergies to buy and consume food. Allergies can be fatal for some people and this is why it is vital that food businesses give their customers information they can trust. ‘The legislation is a huge step forward for those with allergies, who should now feel confident they have a right to ask about allergenic ingredients in the foods they buy. This normalises allergen information as something that should be available at all times.’","Restaurants will be required to identify dishes which contain the allergens .

"Their blood red flowers are a haunting reminder of those who made the ultimate fighting for Britain. But the wild poppy is fast disappearing from the fields of Flanders. Ecologists have warned that the common poppy is being driven out by intensive agriculture. The use of powerful weed killers and nitrogen-rich fertilisers is blamed for the disappearance of 40 per cent of the species found in agricultural fields a century ago. And they say its plight illustrates the wider change in plant life in northern France and Belgian Flanders. The wild poppy is fast disappearing from the fields of Flanders and the use of power weed killers and nitrogen-rich fertilisers is being blamed (stock image) University of Lille researcher Dr Nina Hautekèete said: ‘Poppies are a symbol of the vegetation in the fields. We still have the poppy but it is much more difficult to find.’ She told a British Ecological Society conference that the lost plants have been replaced by new species, with unknown consequences for the environment. The symbol of Remembrance since 1921, the poppy thrives in soil that has been disturbed – and bloomed on the fields destroyed by battle in Northern France and Flanders in the World War One.

The poppy was shortly adopted by the British Legion and today, some 45million are produced a year to remember the nation’s war dead. The money raised is used by the Legion to improve the welfare of veterans, serving personnel and their families.","In less than a century the number of poppies have almost halved in fields .

"Thomas Morris who was strangled by his own karate belt in a freak accident while carrying out a martial arts exercise . A teenage fitness fanatic accidentally strangled himself with a karate belt after trying out a martial arts exercise he had seen on the internet, an inquest has heard. Thomas Morris, 17, was found dead in his home gym in Morriston, Swansea, with the belt around his neck - after trying to copy the training exercise. An inquest heard the karate fan had viewed the online training video of martial arts experts using their belt under their chin. The coroner heard that Thomas, who was also a talented rugby player, had shown his sisters the exercise which he hoped would build up his fitness. His mother Belinda and his cousins went to look for Thomas in the gym in an outbuilding in the garden when she returned from an afternoon out, and found him along with the belt wrapped around his neck. Detective Sergeant Lee Carpenter said: 'They went outside where he would train in the gym. They found him suspended.' Mrs Morris said Thomas was keen on martial arts and had recently been on a trip to the Himalayas with his father. She added: 'He'd been doing different exercises for months and months.' His sisters Catherine and Sarah told police that one of the exercises they believed he had been doing that day, involved something Thomas had seen in a video online. A coroner heard that Thomas, who was also a talented rugby player, had shown his sisters the exercise to build up fitness. But he died after his belt became wrapped around his neck while he  was home alone training in the outside gym . Catherine said: 'He had shown us and he could have been trying it himself.' Swansea Coroner Clive Phillips ruled out suicide and concluded his death was misadventure. Mr Phillips said: 'There was nothing to suspect anything was seriously troubling him. 'We've heard from the family that he might have been carrying out this martial arts technique and death was unintended.'","Thomas Morris, 17, was found dead in home gym in Morriston, Swansea .

"Dismissal: Hannah Whiteman, 24, (with her husband Danny) was awarded £18,000 after a tribunal . A young mother has been awarded more than £18,000 after she was sacked by a bakery when she became pregnant. Hannah Whiteman said her boss told her: ‘This is not the type of job you are able to do while pregnant.’ The 24-year-old claimed she was subjected to ‘fabricated’ complaints about the hygiene of a sandwich van she drove. Her employer was also accused of cutting her hours and overlooking her for a promotion after she had time off due to morning sickness. Mrs Whiteman, who lives with husband Danny in Norwich, was dismissed on March 28 and gave birth to daughter Colette on November 4. She has now been awarded £18,417 after an employment tribunal in Norwich ruled she was unfairly dismissed because of her pregnancy. Speaking afterwards, she said: ‘I worked Monday to Friday and at times even came back to do a double shift … but they shunned me at the first opportunity. They started to treat me differently from the time I told them I was pregnant.’ She added that the ruling showed employers ‘they should do whatever they can to support [pregnant staff]’. Mrs Whiteman began working for The Mix Artisan Bakery in Norwich in April last year. As well as helping in the shop on Saturdays, she drove a sandwich van which traded under the name Fresh2U Ltd. She discovered she was pregnant in January this year. Carl Hitchborn, 36, took over running the business from his parents soon afterwards and within days made changes to the items sold from the van. Mrs Whiteman told the tribunal that shortly afterwards she was given a verbal warning when a customer complained about hygiene standards in her van – an accusation she denies. Hannah Whiteman was dismissed from The Mix Artisan Bakery in Norwich (pictured) in March this year . She believes the incident was ‘fabricated’ because Mr Hitchborn suspected she was pregnant. In February – after bursting into tears when a glass oven door shattered as she was cleaning it – she was called into her boss’s office. Payout: Boss Carl Hitchborn was accused of cutting her hours and overlooking her for promotion . Mrs Whiteman said in a witness statement: ‘I put [my reaction] down to pregnancy hormones.’ She said she ‘blurted out’ that she was expecting and was told ‘this was not the type of job’ for pregnant women. The mother said a manager later told her they ‘didn’t know what they were going to do’ with her. Her hours were cut ‘without any negotiation beforehand’ and she was accused of damaging the key of a van, she added. She was dismissed without notice on March 28, accused of having a month-old sandwich in her van. At the hearing, Mr Hitchborn said in a statement the ‘sole reason’ for dismissal was ‘unacceptable hygiene standards’. But the panel found in Mrs Whiteman’s favour.","Hannah Whiteman, 24, has been awarded more than £18,000 after tribunal .

There are 130 armed rangers patrolling Murchison Falls who are leading the fight against poaching. The giraffe crashes to the earth after being shot by a tranquilliser dart in the Murchison Falls Park in Uganda . The giraffe was shot to avoid it being trapped in a poacher's snare (pictured) that cause a painful death . Two Uganda Wildlife Authority rangers working to conserve the giraffe try to seek out the poachers' snares . A ranger points a tranquilliser gun at the ailing giraffe to remove the snare and then treat resulting wounds . A team of vets, aided by the rangers, work to treat the giraffe caught by a poacher's deadly wire trap . The African giraffe is an endangered species and its population has been decimated by about 40 per cent . Snares mean that giraffes often die lingering and painful deaths as they develop wounds that don't heal . Hunting and poaching have decimated Africa's giraffe population by about 40 per cent. There are now only 80,000 animals currently in the wild. As recently as 15 years ago, there were around 140,000 giraffes in Africa, according to a Giraffe Conservative Foundation study. Fewer than 300 'West African giraffes' remain in Niger, and only 700 'Rothschild's giraffes' left in Uganda and Kenya. Dr Noelle Kumpel, from the Zoological Society of London told Mail Online: 'The threats are local. It's loss of habitat and increasingly it's poaching not for the international trade, but bush meat hunting.' 'Traditionally they get caught in snares by the poorer local people just looking for food,' she said. 'But those hunting higher profile animals have the firearms and automatic weapons which make it simple to kill the noticeable giraffe.' Giraffes are mainly caught in crude snares, 'which pull tight around their necks or legs, causing strangulation and horrific wounds,' according to Richard Bonham, the Director of Operations for the Big Life Foundation in Kenya. As the noose gradually tightens, it can take some hours if not days for them to pass away, he added. 'Snares are cruel. Animals often die lingering and painful deaths or they might break the snare and develop festering wounds that just don't heal,' said Dr Stephanie Romanach of The African Wildlife Conservation Fund. 'Poachers frequently set large numbers of snares and forget where they set them or just leave them in the bush and what's the result? Large numbers of animals killed unnecessarily.' Only 700 'Rothschild's giraffes' (pictured) are left in Uganda and Kenya as they are easily targeted by hunters . The snares pull tightly around a giraffe's neck or legs, causing  strangulation and horrific wounds . Known for their sweet meat, commercial hunters trap and butcher them, before selling the produce in markets . Meat from the creatures can sell for as little as 30p per pound in markets and stalls in some African countries . Trapped in a crude snare, a dead giraffe lies prostrate with its head removed in Africa . The veterinary team at the Uganda Conservative Foundation, together with 130 armed rangers at the Uganda Wildlife Authority, work to conserve the endangered species. The poachers are hauling in record numbers of giraffes because many believe the  animal's meat and/or bone marrow is an HIV cure. Giraffe skin is also thick, durable and suitable for a range of purposes such as making clothing, shoes, bags, belts, hats and covers for drums. Their hair is used to make bracelets, necklaces and other jewellery as far back as ancient Egypt. The Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) rangers have in the last year alone removed more than 7,000 wire snares from the Park but still some giraffe are caught by the snares. Once a giraffe is darted, the rangers and vets are able to remove the snare and treat the resulting wounds. Murchison Falls National Park is Uganda's largest and oldest conservation area, hosting 76 species of mammals and 451 birds.","Giraffe shot by tranquilliser dart to free it from a trap put down by poacher .

"Emma Frampton stole almost £40,000 from her employers, but has avoided jail and been told to pay just £1 . An accountant who stole almost £40,000 from her employers has avoided jail and been told to pay back just £1. Emma Frampton, 39, plundered the money over 18-months from Yorkshire Plating Services in Bradford, taking more than half the firm's annual profit and bringing the company to its knees. A court heard she stole the money by paying it into two accounts  - one a fake company account and another she set up using names of her family - and lavished it on Christmas presents. But a proceeds of crime hearing has ordered her to pay back just £1, despite the fact Frampton had benefited £39,019 from her crime, after her lawyers claimed she was in negative equity. Frampton was given a suspended prison sentence after pleading guilty to theft from her employer, between October 2012 and February this year, and ordered to pay the nominal compensation. Stephen Middow, 57, managing director of the metal plating company said he was disgusted with the outcome. Mr Middow said: 'I spent over 30 years trying to build myself a business and she brought it to its knees in just 18 months. I have truly been let down by the justice system and believe they have let her get away with stealing a vast amount of money.' Frampton was only caught after Mr Middow's accountant noticed the payments, which led back to her. Mr Middow closed all the bank accounts, which alerted her to the fact she had been caught. Frampton, who worked at the firm for over two years, immediately bombarded Mr Middow with several text messages trying to arrange a meeting and in one message even offered to pay back all the funds she had taken. Mr Middow, who is on medication due to stress, said: 'I am absolutely gutted by the whole thing. 'More so as it was a person I had 100 per cent trust in and as a business owner that is what you should have in your staff. It has been sickening to think about. 'She has caused a massive blow to a small business, which could have resulted in several of her colleagues losing their jobs. It has survived after working closely with our account and thanks to our loyal customer base.' Frampton reappeared at Bradford Crown Court for a proceeds of crime hearing on Monday. Stephen Middow, 57, managing director of Yorkshire Plating Services in Bradford, has described the fee as an insult . Her house was in negative equity and there were no funds in it, so prosecutor Patrick Robertshaw asked for a nominal compensation order of £1. Judge Peter Benson was satisfied that there were no assets available to satisfy the order. He added: 'I will make a compensation order in the nominal sum of £1.' Mr Middow's said he then watched the defendant pay £1 compensation straightaway in the courtroom when she passed the coin to her solicitor advocate, Sarah Guttman, who later handed the coin to the prosecutor. Mr Middow described the fee as an insult and believes it was done just so they could write the case off. He added: 'I believe this is a signal to everybody that this kind of behaviour is acceptable. 'Basically, you can take large amounts of money from a company, not go to jail and only pay back £1 of it. 'The amount of stress I have been put under because of this and it feels like nothing has been done for the victims. I fear other employers will not be protected against this and things need to change as there is simply no deterrent for people not to.

"How birds rapidly evolved to have feathers, fly and sing is revealed in a major study where the genomes of 45 species of modern birds were sequenced, to generate the most reliable avian tree of life to date. The international project charts a 'big bang' burst of bird evolution during the 10 to 15 million years after the mass extinction of dinosaurs 66 million years ago, . The period gave rise to nearly all of the 10,000-plus species of birds on Earth today. Scroll down for video . How birds rapidly evolved to have feathers, fly and sing is revealed in a major study where the genomes of 45 species of modern birds were sequenced, to generate the most reliable avian tree of life to date. Close-ups of the diagram can be seen in the video below . The study also suggests that the earliest common ancestor of land birds, which include parrots and songbirds as well as hawks and eagles, was a scaled predator. The four-year project, which involved researchers from the University of Edinburgh's Roslin Institute, decoded and compared the genetic fingerprints of 45 bird species, including the woodpecker, owl, penguin, hummingbird and flamingo as well as those of three reptile species and humans. The vast study provides fresh insights into how bird genes differ from those of mammals, and the biological mechanisms that gave rise to the vast diversity among birds. Decoding the genomes enabled the experts to investigate at which point in each species' history specialised characteristics developed, such as feathers, flight and song. Scientists completed the largest whole genome study of a single class of animals to date by mapping the tree of life for birds. Avian genetic samples from Louisiana State University's Museum of Natural Science, which has one of the largest vertebrate tissue collections in the world (shown), were used for this study . The study also suggests that the earliest common ancestor of land birds, which include parrots and songbirds as well as hawks and eagles (stock image), was a scaled predator . How birds rapidly evolved to have feathers, fly and sing is revealed in a major study where the genomes of 45 species of modern birds were sequenced, to generate the most reliable avian tree of life to date. A simplified version is shown . Previous attempts to reconstruct the avian family tree using partial DNA sequencing or anatomical and behavioural traits have met with contradiction and confusion. This is because modern birds split into species early and in such quick succession, which that they did not evolve enough distinct genetic differences at the genomic level. To resolve the timing and relationships of modern birds, researchers used something known as whole-genome DNA sequences to infer the bird species tree. 'In the past, people have been using 10 to 20 genes to try to infer the species relationships,' Erich Jarvis of Duke University. 'What we've learned from doing this whole-genome approach is that we can infer a somewhat different phylogeny [family tree] than what has been proposed in the past. ‘We've figured out that protein-coding genes tell the wrong story for inferring the species tree.’ There are two general types of gene in the human genome: non-coding RNA genes and protein-coding genes . Instead of focusing on protein-coded genes, Louisiana State University contributed to the reconstruction of the bird tree by analysing something called loci called ultra-conserved elements, or UCEs. By aligning these highly conserved parts of the genome and analysing the subtle variations across the different species, the UCE data helped piece together this new tree of life for birds. Researchers found that the UCE data provided consistent results to infer evolutionary history whereas traditionally, scientists have used data from the protein coding parts of the genome called exons for this purpose. 'It opens up the potential in terms of the types of data people will collect and use in the future when reconstructing the tree of life,' said Brant Faircloth, Curator of Genetic Resources Frederick Sheldon. Once they inferred a tree from the data, collaborators used the fossil record to date the divergence of each species across millions of years. They found that birdsong evolved independently at least twice, for example. Parrots and songbirds gained the ability to learn and mimic vocal activity independently of hummingbirds, despite sharing many of the same genes. This is surprising because animals with similar characteristics usually share a close common ancestor. The findings are relevant because some of brain processes that are involved in birds singing are also associated with human speech production. More than 200 scientists contributed to the Avian Phylogenomics Project, and the findings are published in 23 scientific papers, including eight in the journal Science. As part of the study, researchers from the University of Kent found that chickens and turkeys experienced fewer large genomic changed than other birds, as they evolved from their dinosaur ancestor. Professor Darren Griffin explained that the chicken and turkey lineages have undergone the fewest number of changes compared to their ancient avian ancestor thought to be a feathered dinosaur. One report by Dr Ed Green, of University of California, describes the sequencing of three crocodilian genomes - the American alligator's, the saltwater crocodile's, and the Indian gharial's - which represent birds' closest living relatives. Dr Green said: 'The molecular evolution of birds is much faster than it is in crocodiles, turtles and other reptilian lineages. So this avian lineage seems to be faster than other reptiles, but not faster than mammals.' By studying the genes of penguins as part of the huge study, scientists at the China National Genebank in Shenzhen discovered that penguins have a vast number of genes responsible for creating the raw material needed for feathers - proteins known as beta-keratins. They carry more genes for a particular type of beta keratin than any other bird and it is thought this is what allows them develop their thick plumage of short, stiff feathers that keep them warm. The scientists also discovered that penguins have a gene called DSG1, which in humans is known to be involved in a dermatological disease characterised by thick skin on the palms and feet. Frozen samples of muscle tissue from bird species (pictured) collected by the Smithsonian Institution were the source of DNA extracted in Duke University labs. The DNA was then sent to BGI in China for full genome sequencing . One report by Dr Ed Green, of University of California, and colleagues describes the sequencing of three crocodilian genomes - the American alligator's, the saltwater crocodile's (pictured), and the Indian gharial's - which represent birds' closest living relatives . It's believed these genes may help the penguins develop a uniquely thick skin compared to other birds. Building on the huge project, scientists at the National Avian Research Facility in Edinburgh have created 48 open access databases to share and expand on the information associated with the birds' genomes. They hope that researchers from around the world will continue to upload their own data, offering further insights to the genetics of modern birds. Such information will be useful for helping scientists to understand why infectious diseases, such as bird flu, affect some species but not others. Professor David Burt, of the National Avian Research Facility, said: 'This is just the beginning. 'We hope that giving people the tools to explore this wealth of bird gene information in one place will stimulate further research. 'Ultimately, we hope the research will bring important insights to help improve the health and welfare of wild and farmed birds.' Adélie penguins have eight genes for metabolising fat, which may allow them to adapt quickly to warmer conditions but could leave them struggling in colder weather when food sources are more scarce .","Genomes of 45 species of modern birds were sequenced for huge study .

"Former Sydney Morning Herald journalist Mike Carlton has hit out at Attorney General George Brandis after he claimed the columnist was 'sacked' for 'anti-Semitic journalism' during a Senate estimates hearing. Carlton said he would sue Senator Brandis if he repeated the claim that the journalist was fired over outside the Senate, where he is not protected by parliamentary privilege. 'Brandis says I was 'sacked' by the SMH for ""anti-Semitic journalism.' Say that outside the Senate, Soapy, and I'll sue your smug a*** off,' he wrote on Twitter. Scroll down for video . Former Sydney Morning Herald journalist Mike Carlton (left) has hit out at Senator George Brandis (right) On Thursday during a hearing of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, Senator Brandis made the claims when he hit out at Carlton for criticising the winner of the Prime Minister's Literary Award in the history category. Carlton has been very vocal about his disapproval of joint winner Hal G.P. Colebatch's book Australia's Secret War - which he labelled a 'right-wing rant against Australian trade unions' in a column published in Crikey. Senator Brandis said he encouraged controversy over art prizes but labelled Carlton's statements 'rather mean-spirited controversy'. 'One of the unsuccessful shortlisted candidates for the Australian History Award, Mike Carlton, who was earlier this year sacked by The Sydney Morning Herald for his anti-Semitic journalism, took to Twitter to denounce one of the joint winners of the prize,' he said, . The columnist denied the Attorney-General's claims he was 'sacked' for 'anti-Semitic journalism' Carlton said he would sue Senator Brandis if he repeated the claim that the journalist was fired over outside the Senate, where he is not protected by parliamentary privilege . Mr Brandis also said Carlton made 'some very, very unpleasant and really despicable personal attacks' on the chair of the panel Gerard Henderson. 'So, from all the dozens of entrants into that category, it had put him as one of the five shortlisted candidates and already awarded him a prize of $5,000,' he continued. 'But, because he did not win the award or was not named as one of the joint winners, he took to Twitter to attack Gerard Henderson and attack one of the joint winners of the prize, which I thought was pretty poor form.' On Friday, Carlton hit back saying Senator Brandis was 'completely wrong'. 'I was not sacked by the Herald, I resigned, and there was no hint of anti-Semitic journalism,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'But I do not expect a fool like Brandis to get those small, important details right. 'Just as we all have a right to be a bigot, I suppose the Attorney General has a right to be a nincompoop.' Senator Brandis made the claims when he hit out at Carlton for criticising the winner of the Prime Minister's Literary Award in the history category . Carlton sensationally quit the Sydney Morning Herald in August after coming under fire for using abusive language in response to reader feedback about his column on the Gaza-Israel conflict. The column was run alongside a cartoon showing a Jewish man watching Gaza be bombed from his armchair, which the newspaper later apologised for. Sydney Morning Herald Editor-in-Chief Darren Goodsir also apologised for Carlton's behaviour, calling it 'completely unacceptable'. 'I have asked Mike to apologise for these actions. Mike regrets his behaviour and will be contacting affected readers to apologise,' Mr Goodsir said. 'On behalf of the Herald, I too apologise for any offence caused.' At the time Carlton said he ended his long career at the paper when representatives rang to tell him they were suspending him for 'four to six weeks'. The move came as he was slammed for using abusive language towards readers, including calling one a 'Jewish bigot' and telling them to 'f*** off'.

"Nothing could be clearer. David Miliband, then Labour’s Foreign Secretary, laying claim to the moral high ground, proclaiming: ‘I abhor anything that constitutes torture. Water-boarding, it’s perfectly clear to me it is torture. ‘I never supported extraordinary rendition to torture, always said that Guantanamo should be closed. There is no clash of ideals and pragmatism there.’ His uncompromising comments came in an interview in the New Statesman magazine in 2009. Scroll down for video . David Miliband tried to use the court system over a period of six months to block publication of the fact that MI5 had connived in the torture of one suspect, Binyam Mohamed . With Labour trailing in the polls and likely to lose the election that was due the following year, and with the party subsequently expected to choose a new leader, Miliband was attempting to burnish his leadership credentials and pose as a world statesman. The truth is that those pious words turned out to be as hollow as his younger brother Ed’s vow of family loyalty as he ruthlessly knifed David and stood for the leadership himself. For exactly one year after David Miliband’s ‘I abhor torture’ interview, he was exposed as being behind a cover-up of one of the most shameful episodes in New Labour’s rule — Britain’s secret involvement in the torture of terror suspects overseas. Miliband had tried to use the court system over a period of six months to block publication of the fact that MI5 had connived in the torture of one suspect, Binyam Mohamed, a former British resident who had been detained in Pakistan in 2002 on suspicion of having attended an Al Qaeda training camp. Mohamed, a former British resident, was detained in Pakistan in 2002 on suspicion of having attended an Al Qaeda training camp. Court documents revealed he was ubjected to 'cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment by the U.S. authorities', in which the British intelligence services had been complicit . Three times, Miliband went to court to obtain Public Interest Immunity certificates (which exclude official documents from public view) to try to keep the truth secret about his torture in Morocco. In the process of concealing MI5’s dirty secrets, the Foreign Office ran up a taxpayer-funded legal bill of £213,000. But Miliband failed. In a landmark ruling in February 2010, the Court of Appeal effectively accused MI5 of complicity in torture and a culture of disregarding human rights. So what was the deeply compromised Miliband trying to conceal? The court documents said that Binyam Mohamed had been subjected to ‘cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment by the U.S. authorities’, in which the British intelligence services had been complicit. Miliband's pious words on torture turned out to be as hollow as his younger brother Ed’s vow of family loyalty as he ruthlessly knifed David and stood for the leadership himself . The documents also said he was ‘intentionally subjected to continuous sleep deprivation. The effects of the sleep deprivation were carefully observed’. Mohamed was awarded £1 million compensation — a clear sign of the Establishment’s guilt. It must be said that Mr Miliband was only trying to cover up something that had occurred mostly in 2002, under a previous Labour Foreign Secretary. But the court’s findings had made public the brutal methods deployed by the Americans, with the full knowledge of MI5, which went against a commitment made by the then British government at the height of the Ulster Troubles that banned torture techniques such as subjecting hooded prisoners to beatings, food and sleep deprivation, and exposure to very loud noise for prolonged periods. Among arguments about torture heard by the court was that ‘if it had been administered on behalf of the UK, it would clearly have been a breach of the undertaking given by the UK in 1972.’ Following the Court of Appeal ruling, a shame-faced Miliband had to go to the Commons and grovel, saying he had gone to court on a principle that was 'fundamental to national security' Following the Court of Appeal ruling, a shame-faced Miliband had to go to the Commons and grovel, saying he had gone to court on a principle that was ‘fundamental to national security’. How ironic that the man who was Prime Minister at the time of this appalling treatment of a terror suspect was Tony Blair, who had spoken of war as being a moral crusade. This is the same man whose first Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, had proclaimed the party’s commitment to an ‘ethical’ foreign policy. This is the same man who converted to Catholicism and whose current job — among many other lucrative posts — is as a peace envoy. And what about his one-time Labour colleague, David Miliband? What is clear is that he was egged on by Downing Street officials, who realised that the continuing stench over the Iraq War was damaging Prime Minister Gordon Brown’s election prospects. Miliband sent the U.S. State Department a stream of letters and emails, pleading with the Washington administration to back him and prevent the public release of the documents, whose contents could deeply damage the special relationship between the two countries on intelligence-gathering. Indeed, so serious were Miliband’s concerns that he sent his top legal adviser, Daniel Bethlehem QC, to Washington. Next, Miliband raised the political temperature by attacking ‘irresponsible judges’, claiming that if they authorised the release of the information, they would be giving ‘succour to the country’s enemies’. Even after losing his legal battle, he rejected the chance, during his ill-fated leadership campaign, to come clean. Instead, he persisted in his denials about Labour’s role in barbaric torture. Asked in a BBC interview by Andrew Neil if he was aware that MI5 had provided questions for the CIA to put to terrorist suspects who were being tortured, he replied: ‘We don’t have evidence of that.’ Yet the truth is that, as Foreign Secretary, he submitted documents to the court which showed the reverse was true. They confirmed that British intelligence was involved in questioning terror suspects, including Binyam Mohamed. Surely, a politician with more moral scruples would have put public duty above all else and would have set up an inquiry into the allegations that at least 15 British nationals or residents claimed to have been tortured with the complicity, knowledge and sometimes even in the presence of British intelligence officers? How ironic that the man who was Prime Minister at the time of this appalling treatment of a terror suspect was Tony Blair, who had spoken of war as being a moral crusade. This is the same man whose first Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook (right), had proclaimed the party’s commitment to an 'ethical' foreign policy . It is clear that Miliband was egged on by Downing Street officials, who realised that the continuing stench over the Iraq War was damaging Prime Minister Gordon Brown’s election prospects . To this day, Miliband’s supporters insist that he was not fully aware of the details of the Americans’ torture activities. But Tory MP David Davis is scathing about their refusal to accept the truth, saying that it was irresponsible to suggest that the evidence was a threat to national security. ‘He is guilty of a cover-up,’ he says. The irony is that David Miliband now runs an international human rights charity. As director of the International Rescue Committee, he earns £300,000 a year. One reason he was given the job was because of his top-level political contacts as a former British Foreign Secretary. Working from an office in New York, Miliband was recently praised by former U.S. president Bill Clinton as ‘one of the ablest, most creative public servants of our time’. Last month, he schmoozed with Sting, one of the world’s most celebrated pop stars, and Star Trek actor Sir Patrick Stewart, another Labour luvvie, at a gala dinner at the Waldorf Astoria in New York. Following the appalling revelations by the Senate committee, will New York’s smart set be so keen to be seen with David Miliband when they learn about his own shameful role in trying to cover it up?","David Miliband tried to use courts  to keep truth of suspect's torture secret .

"Comic Relief will have raised more than £1billion for charity once next year’s appeal has finished. Screenwriter Richard Curtis, who set up the charity in 1985 with Lenny Henry, said he hoped to pass the mark on Red Nose Day in March. According to its latest accounts, the charity still has £108million sitting in its investment portfolio. Scroll down for video . Richard Curtis, left, and Lenny Henry, right, founded Comic Relief in 1985 and are set to break £1bn barrier . The revelation comes after another BBC-backed charity - Children in Need - admitted it is sitting on investments of £87.7million. But Mr Curtis, who is the author of Blackadder and Four Weddings and a Funeral, boasted that next year’s Comic Relief campaign was likely to net the charity more money than ever. The 57-year-old told the Radio Festival in Salford: ‘Unless a horrible scandal occurs and it turns out Lenny Henry has been killing and eating children all these years, I think we are going to cross a billion pounds.’ He joked: ‘I think we’re going to cross a billion rather earlier in the evening than we’d like. You’d have hoped we’d reach a billion about 11.40pm.

I hope it will be an amazing year.’ A Comic Relief spokesman said the charity has raised £960million to date. The last Red Nose Day, in 2013, raised more than £75million in one night after an eight hour show on BBC1 and BBC2, passing 2011’s record total of £74.3million. That year, it gave out more than £103million to good causes, principally to charities that fight poverty in sub-Saharan Africa. But it was mired in scandal after it emerged the charity had pumped millions of pounds of donations into controversial ‘bombs, booze and fags’ funds even as it backed projects to help victims of alcohol abuse, war and smoking-related illnesses. Following a public backlash, the charity pledged to be ‘more transparent’ with its cash in future and said it would no longer invest in arms or tobacco firms, or companies ‘whose primary business is the manufacture of alcohol products’. During Comic Relief broadcasts, celebrities including David Beckham, Jennifer Saunders and Graham Norton have repeated the charity’s pledge that ‘for every pound the charity gets directly from the public a pound goes to helping transform the lives of people living with poverty and social injustice’. The charity’s latest accounts show it employs nearly 300 people with a £13million annual wage bill. Chief executive Kevin Cahill’s pay has increased from £111,000 to £131,000 since 2008, with five directors earning more than £80,000. According to its latest accounts, the charity still has £108million sitting in its investment portfolio . A Comic Relief spokesman said: ‘There is always a significant amount of money that has been committed to charities and projects that is waiting to be paid out. This is because we pay grants in instalments, so that we can monitor how the money has been spent before giving the next instalment. ‘Comic Relief takes grant making very seriously and works hard to ensure the money awarded is spent as agreed. ‘This money has been donated and it would be unprofessional to pay it all out in single payments without these checks.’ ‘The salary of Comic Relief’s chief executive is approximately £34,000 less than the average for chief executives in the top 100 charities.’","Richard Curtis boasted next year's campaign will net most money ever .

"It’s now a smart, modern home that any family would be happy to call their own. So it’s hard to believe that just over a year ago the property was bought for only £1 as part of a radical regeneration project. Taxi driver Jayalal Madde was the first to buy one of 20 run-down terrace houses offered for sale for a pound by the council in an effort to revitalise a Liverpool neighbourhood blighted by boarded-up homes. Scroll down for video . Jayalal Madde bought the four-bedroom property for £1 last year and hopes to move in with his wife Chaminda, 48, and two daughters before Christmas . To deter speculators and landlords, they were sold on condition that the purchaser was a local first-time buyer and had a job, would spend tens of thousands of pounds on refurbishing it, and promised to live there for at least five years. Now Mr Madde has become the first person to finish the rebuilding work, and he and his family are hoping to move in before Christmas. Spared mortgage repayments, they have been able to plough more than £30,000 into transforming the four-bedroom Toxteth house, including a stylish, modern kitchen with giant American-style fridge and a designer bathroom. Mr Madde, 49, said yesterday: ‘I love the house because it’s a big, double-fronted terrace. I’m trying to move in before Christmas. There’s work still to do but I hope it won’t take long.’ He converted the home from two flats and installed new wiring, plumbing, windows and flooring . He said that once the other homes in the area were done up, it would be a ‘brand-new, regenerated community’. ‘I have spent less than £40,000 plus one pound and we have this amazing family home. The girls can’t wait to move in,’ he told Liverpool Confidential website. ‘Around the corner some smaller two-bedroomed homes were renovated and sold for just under £100,000. On that basis our house will be worth at least £150,000.’ The taxi driver spent around £35,000 on renovating the home and now believes it is worth £150,000 . The property had been empty for 20 years and it had been on the council's list to be demolished for 15 years . The property had been empty for around 20 years, having previously been converted into flats before the residents left and nobody wanted to move in. After becoming one of the lucky applicants among 1,000 would-be buyers, Mr Madde, who moved to Liverpool from his native Sri Lanka eight years ago, had said: ‘It has always been our dream to own our own home. 'I’ve been saving up for years, and trying to get loans and a mortgage.’ The home was bought last year under a Liverpool council scheme to sell off 20 derelict properties . During a tour, the Mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson (left), said the house had been lovingly transformed . Refurbishment work began in May, and while flooring and furniture still need to be moved in, all the necessary structural changes are now complete. Mr Madde is currently living in rented accommodation nearby with his wife and their daughters Sansali, 13, and Simali, 11. Liverpool council’s remaining £1 homes have all now found buyers and renovation work will begin in the coming months. The taxi driver put down new wooden flooring and built storage units in all four bedrooms . In total 200 derelict properties in the Granby, Picton and Arnside Road areas of Liverpool are being brought back into use . During a guided tour, Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson said: ‘I am really pleased to be having a look round Mr Madde’s new home and seeing the work he has carried out to bring it up to standard. 'I know from my conversations with him that he has a genuine commitment to the area and it is great to know that a once-run-down property has been lovingly transformed into a home for his family.’ In total nearly 200 derelict properties in the city are being brought back into use under a huge regeneration scheme. The Mayor said the pound scheme is the first of its kind in the country and is being copied by other towns .

"A 31-year-old man has been questioned by police over the horrific death of teenager Jessica Chambers, as police continue to analyse surveillance footage showing her 90 minutes before she was burned alive. Derrick Turner said he was quizzed on Monday at the Panola County jail, but denied that he had anything to do with the Mississippi murder. Turner said that he had no idea why he was brought in by the authorities. Last moments: Jessica Chambers, 19, was caught on surveillance footage just 90 minutes before she was burned alive along the side of a rural road on Saturday. She is seen walking towards the store . Tragic: Jessica Chambers, 19, was doused with a flammable liquid and burned alive on Saturday night and police say they have not yet identified a suspect in her murder . Seen: A person off camera caught her attention and after waving, she walked over to say hello . Caught on camera: Jessica (seen left) then went into the shop and paid while three men chatted nearby . He told Wmcactionnews5.com: 'I was just called in for a situation I didn't know nothing about. They was just asking me did I know her or was I sleeping with her, you know. Like I said, I didn't know her like that.' He added: 'She was a sweet girl so that's why I'm messed up about it, whatever happened to her, I hate it happened you know.' Police are investigating footage that shows Chambers walking across a gas station forecourt in Courtland before waving at someone off camera and going to speak to them. She then walks into the store and pays before returning to her car. A man can be seen filling up a gasoline can beside her vehicle, but police say he has been cleared in the investigation. The footage released by police shows Jessica just before 6.30pm on Saturday. About 90 minutes later, a motorist called 911 to report a burning car a mile away and first responders arrived to find the young woman covered in flames. She fell to the ground and whispered something to one of the fire officers. Investigators have not revealed what she said but indicated that they may help find her killer, WMC reported. 'She was able to communicate. It was difficult,' said Jay Hale, an assistant district attorney who prosecutes cases in Panola County. Convenience store manager Ali Fadhel said Chambers came in frequently and he would often speak with her. He told The Associated Press that Chambers spoke with someone before entering the store to purchase gas. On her way out, Chambers got a call on her cellphone, Fadhel said. After she pumped gas, she re-entered the store, bought cigarettes, and drove away, heading south on Highway 51, he said. According to Fadhel, Chambers was wearing a dark-colored sweater and pajama pants that looked like sweatpants. Chambers said she was going to make a stop before going home, Fadhel said. 'If she knew she had a problem with somebody, she would have told me,' Fadhel said. Chambers bought $14 worth of gas, more than the $5 or so she usually purchased, he said. 'I asked her, 'Why are you putting so much gas?' She said, 'I'm going somewhere,'' Fadhel said. Hale said he could not comment on Fadhel's statements. 'We've talked to a lot of people and some of those people could end up being a suspect,' District Attorney John Champion told USA Today on Wednesday. 'But as of right now we have not questioned anybody who we believe to be a suspect.' He added: 'I feel like it's something we're going to solve. It could be in the next five minutes, five months or five years. You just don't know.' Peter Odom, an attorney who prosecuted some arson cases, told HLN's 'Nancy Grace' that investigators will be assessing the physical appearance of suspects. Questions: While she was inside, a man (seen top right) filled up a gas can close to her car (the dark vehicle in the center) but he has been cleared. After going inside the shop, she drove off . Terrifying: She had told her mother she was going out to get food when she and her car were set alight . 'They're looking for someone with singed eyebrows and maybe burned hands. Because the burner often gets burned,' he said. Police have not disclosed what Chambers said or tried to say, but her father, Ben Chambers, told the channel she told them who was responsible for the horrifying crime. 'She told them, she told them, told him who done it,' he said. When responders arrived on the scene, she was walking along Herron Road, near Highway 51, and covered in flames, and was flown to Region One Health in Memphis but later died. Authorities said initial autopsy results reveal the girl died from severe burns that covered 98 per cent of her body. 'I mean it's bad,' DA John Champion told Fox. 'I have been doing this for 21 years and as far as the means of death it is certainly the worst I have dealt with.' Panola County Sheriff Dennis Darby said she had been doused with a flammable liquid and set on fire. Her father also said she had 'a big gash on her head'. 'They squirted lighter fluid down her throat and in her nose, and apparently they knocked her out,' added Mr Chambers, a maintenance worker for the sheriff's department. 'When the fire department got there, she was walking down the road on fire ... only part of her body that wasn't burned was the bottom of her feet.' Scene: Her car was found along this dirt bank and she was found walking along the road in flames . As well as the surveillance footage, detectives have been examining the girl's cellphone, which was found at the scene. Her car was also at the scene but was left completely charred by the inferno. Authorities are also looking into reports that she went to a party before her death, Chambers said. Friends said that the family can't think of anyone that might have wanted to hurt Jessica, who didn't have a boyfriend and was not known to have been seeing anyone. They added that she had just started a new job at Goody's Department Store, which she loved. Lisa Chambers, the girl's mother, begged with anyone to come forward with any information they may have about the heinous crime. 'They have ripped everything I have,' she told Fox. 'She left to go clean out her car and was going to get [herself] something to eat.' Chambers' grandmother, Dot Boatright, said the family was doing as well as can be expected. Boatright said she 'went all to pieces' when she heard about Chambers' death. Heartbroken: Her mother, Lisa Chambers, sobbed as she pleaded with the public for information . Ripped apart: Her father Ben, right, said someone poured lighting fluid down his daughter's throat and nose before setting her alight. He has also appealed for any information in her death . Not much was immediately revealed about the woman's background by authorities, but Boatright said of her granddaughter, 'She was just a sweet little girl.' Amanda Prince, who identified herself as Jessica Chambers' older sister, told CNN Wednesday night that the family is 'shocked, lost ... confused, angry, hurt.' 'I have so many questions,' she said. 'I want to know why.' Asked if she knew of anyone who had a grudge against her sister or might want to hurt her, Prince replied, 'No one. She was loved by everybody. I don't know who would want to do this or why.' Prince described her sister as 'very athletic' and outgoing, and said that at various times she had expressed interest in becoming a nurse, a dentist and a writer. 'She was happy all the time,' she said. 'She made everyone laugh. She lit up a room. ... She was just full of life.' The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation is assisting Panola authorities because of her father's connection to the police department. No arrests have yet been made. Mississippi authorities say they have received offers to help from several agencies, including the U.S. attorney's office and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Autopsy results have not been released, and it was not clear when they would be available. Anyone with information on the murder should contact the Sheriff's Office at 662-563-6230.

"Shocking footage has emerged of three casino security guards pinning a man to the pavement and holding his head over a gutter filled with water as onlookers urge the bouncers to let the man go. After pushing the man on to the road, one of the guards can be seen holding his knee on the back of the man's head.

"A Russian policeman had to cling on for dear life when a rogue driver sped off during a roadside check, and took the officer with him on his car bonnet. The policeman was stuck on the bonnet of the car for three miles before his colleagues were able to stop the 24-year-old driver by shooting his tyres flat. The incident was filmed by a fellow driver, and the clip sees a white Toyota speed past other vehicles with the policeman on the bonnet. Going for a ride: The policeman clings on for dear life as a rogue driver speeds down the road in Omsk in southern Russia's Omsk Oblast . Novel Tretyakov, 37, accidentally filmed the incident on the outskirts of the city of Omsk in southern Russia's Omsk Oblast, with his car's dashcam. 'I was parked at the side of the road and wanted to pull onto the main road and then turn left,' Mr Tretyakov explains. 'I could see my review mirror that there was a car coming up behind me so I waited for it to go past, but couldn't believe it when I saw it had a policeman clinging to the front. 'I'm surprised the driver could see, but he was driving along at a normal speed almost as if there was nothing unusual. 'It was actually quite comical although I guess pretty dangerous and frightening for the policeman.' Hold tight: The policeman had stopped the driver for a roadside check, and in an attempt to avoid getting caught driving without a license, the 24-year-old sped off . The incident took place last Friday when police officers carrying out a routine roadside check had tried to stop a Toyota Vitz, which had then sped off. Police spokesman Trofim Zhirov said: 'We set up a roadblock a short distance away, but the driver pushed the police car out of the way with his own vehicle, and then ended up collecting a police officer on his bonnet when he tried to stop the car.' Police eventually stopped the Toyota driver by shooting out his tyres and rescued the shocked police officer after he was carried three miles. Not letting go: The policeman managed to hold on to the windscreen for three miles before his colleagues stopped the driver by shooting his tyres .

Spokesman Zhirov added: 'The officer could have been badly hurt at any stage if he had fallen in front of the vehicle. 'Given that it was a snow-covered road there is no chance the driver could have stopped. He was arrested, and the case is being prepared against him.' The 24-year-old offender has a history of dangerous driving, and was driving without a license, as it had been revoked in the summer. He now faces attempted murder charges in addition to motoring offences.","Russian policeman taken on three-mile ride on offender's car bonnet .

"Rugby coach Austen Howells, 40, led a secret double life as a doting father during the week and as a drug-taker at weekends. He was found dead following a massive binge at a stag do in Stockport . An NHS director's husband who led a secret double life of drug-taking and alcohol abuse died following a massive binge at a friend's stag weekend, an inquest heard. Rugby coach Austen Howells, 40, was hailed a 'superdad' by his family and wife Alex, who knew him as a health-conscious home-loving father of two who rarely drank. However, Mr Howells, from St Bride's Major near Cardiff, was known to friends as 'Mr all or nothing', who regularly snorted cocaine and took pills when he was out at weekends. His hidden life emerged last August after he died following a binge during a weekend away with 40 friends. A post-mortem examination found he had more than five different types of drugs in his system, including cocaine, amphetamines and methadrone. A coroner at an inquest in Stockport, Greater Manchester, today described his death as 'particularly tragic' and said he was a 'man who had everything to live for'. The inquest heard how Mr Howells had bought 150 tablets, which he had dubbed 'super pills', prior to the weekend away with his friends in August last year. He had stashed the drugs in his glasses case, hiding them from his wife, before travelling from Wales to Bredbury Hall Hotel and Country Club in Stockport with 40 friends for the stag do. The hearing was told Mr Howells was due to be master of ceremony for the wedding of bridegroom-to-be Benjamin Davies and rang him days before the stag weekend to say: 'How much shall I bring? 2/3 ounce?'. He also spoke of 'super pills'. Mr Davies, a former teammate, told the inquest: 'He would take cocaine most weekends and I believe there were periods when he was depressed. 'Austen was a different person on the weekend than he was in the week. 'In the week he was really homely and placid but on the weekend he used to let his hair down.  Austen was ""Mr all or nothing"". If he was doing something like that he wanted everyone to be in it. 'He rang me the week before the stag to discuss how much cocaine to bring. 'He said something about 'super-pills', I can only assume he meant ecstasy tablets.' He said the health fanatic had become a regular drug user and was hooked on the painkiller Tramadol following an ankle injury. Mr Howells was found dead in a room at Bredbury Hall Hotel and Country Club in Stockport (pictured) on August 8 last year following night-out for a stag do with 40 friends. He had taken a cocktail of various drugs . The inquest heard that the stags had started drinking on the coach after meeting at a Wetherspoons restaurant in South Wales on August 8. Once arriving at the hotel, the group began drinking in the hotel bar and following an all-night binge Mr Howell's was found in his room, at about 5.30am, where he was 'talking gibberish', the inquest heard. Mr Davies saw cocaine on the desk and a friend went into his bag and opened the glasses case to see the haul of grey speckled pills. Mr Davies said: 'I assumed they were the pills he mentioned the week before on the phone, the super pills. 'He took about three in one go. Then I think he took another and gave me another.' He added that they went to another room where they drank more and Mr Howells pulled more from his pocket despite being 'right out of it' and 'delirious'. He said he got the impression that he was helping himself to more because 'it took a long time to kick in' and went on: 'He took another one. He would go round the boys and offer them it, share them out.' Mr Howells, a rugby player and coach, was hailed a 'superdad' but hid a secret life of drug-taking and alcohol abuse at weekends, according to friends . As the binge continued into the morning, three of Mr Howells' friends opted to stay with him rather than go to watch a St Helen's rugby match which they had travelled to Stockport for. Ejike Uzoigwe said: 'He was talking about ""I have got something with me"", what I would describe as pills, sort of bluish greyish. 'He didn't make any sense he was sweating, a bit agitated, he was going on about demons in his head. He would say, ""think of a happy place think of a happy place"".' He said that he and another stag party reveller James Donavan spent three hours with their friend before briefly leaving him in the room. When Mr Donovan returned at about 2pm, he found Mr Howells unresponsive on the floor. Tests found he had cocaine, amphetamines, methadrone, diazepam, tramadol and AMT, an ecstasy-type drug, in his system. Police also found text and Facebook messages in which Mr Howells had spoken of 'high grade stuff', adding: 'It's banging stuff got it from the horse's mouth.' One Facebook message said: 'Still haven't slept since Friday, on a bender got high-graded' while another read: 'Not going to make money, it's for the boys and Ben'. The Stockport hearing was told how Mrs Howells, 46, an executive director for NHS Wales, knew nothing of her husband's drug taking. The Welshman, who played rugby semi-professionally with Bridgend Ravens and was coaching with Maesteg, was described as a 'natural father' by Mrs Howells who he married in 1999. In a statement she said she loved her husband for his 'energy, life and fun' and added: 'Everyone loved him, he didn't judge people on status or job. 'He didn't like drinking or going out, he was a serious sportsman. He was a natural father. 'His friends called him superdad. We were happy and good family unit. The children had the healthiest lunch boxes. 'Rugby Sevens, that was his thing. He had never been a big one for going out.' She said that in the run up to his death they were in 'the happiest time' of their lives and had 'enjoyed a great family life'. Mr Howells' sister Samantha Freeman said her brother had been a 'stay-at-home dad' and an 'extremely doting father' who had never mentioned any drug use. She told the inquest: 'As a family Austen would always drive. A lot of people were shocked because Austen never used to drink alcohol.' She added that although he had seen a mental health nurse in relation to depression he was never diagnosed. Stockport Coroners Court heard that the quantity of the drugs individually did not kill Mr Howells outright, but that as a cocktail they are likely to have triggered his cardiac arrest. Recording a narrative verdict, coroner Joanne Kearsley said Mr Howell's was a 'young man who everything to live for'. She said: 'It is particularly tragic when someone who in many ways was clearly a talented, dedicated and respected individual who spent time developing and fostering youth talent, died in such a needless and senseless way. 'He appeared to be a man who lived an almost paradoxical life, health-conscious, sporty, family man but someone sadly who had an unhealthy long-standing drug habit. 'He brought the vast majority of drugs to that weekend, he wasn't the only person to take drugs. It is in my view quite a shameful day when I hear that such drug taking is prevalent in rugby circles. 'He was a young man who had everything to live for. He was clearly respected in the community, it is a waste of talent. I hope others here that message loud and clear.'","Austen Howells was hailed a health-conscious 'superdad' who rarely drank .

"Sex crimes unit detectives have interviewed bar staff and customers at a local hotel in Batemans Bay in an effort to hunt down a man who punched a woman to the ground in a public toilet and then raped her as  her six-year-old daughter cowering in the next cubicle. The brutal assault happened at 4pm on Thursday in the quiet seaside town on the NSW south coast, after the 37-year-old mother had picked her daughter up from school and had taken her to play on the equipment at Lions Park. While she was waiting for her daughter in the toilet block, an unknown man entered the toilet block and approached her. The woman managed to stay calm and ask her daughter to stay in the toilet cubicle with the door locked, before the man punched her. Knocked to the floor of the toilet block, the woman lost consciousness while he raped her,  coming to while he still lay on top of her. The woman, who is believed to be a local area resident, noticed the man's grubby white t-shirt, his bad body odour and breath, and the distinctively frayed and faded cap he was wearing. Scroll down for video . Police have released an artist's impression of the hat worn by the man who sexually assaulted a 37-year-old mother in a public toilet block Batemans Bay in southern NSW on November 27 . The man fled and the woman raised the alarm and was rushed to Moruya Hospital for treatment, and then released. The six-year-old daughter was not injured in the attack and is understood to not be fully aware of what happened. Shocked locals are disturbed that a woman in their usually quiet community, a popular holiday destination 280km south of Sydney, could fall prey to such a brutal and random sexual assault. 'This is normally a safe place and so a lot of people are talking about it,' a manager at the nearby Bayview Hotel said, 'detectives have come in and interviewed quite a few people, so perhaps someone will recognise the description.' The hotel and other local businesses have put up poster of an image of the rapist's distinctive hat, issued by police using the victim's detailed description. The man police are looking for is described as being about 175cm tall with a medium build, a rounded stomach and an olive complexion. His baseball cap was frayed, tattered and a faded blue  that detectives believe could be the key to identifying the man. The front brim was worn through to reveal the dark blue colour of the original fabric underneath, while on the top of the cap the material had split and worn to the extent that the button on the crown of the cap had worn through to the silver base. 'I think it would be fair to describe this as a brutal crime with extreme violence,' Detective Sergeant Nick Sprowles from the Sex Crime Command said. 'We have never heard of something like this happening before. No one knows what happened, no one saw a thing,' one business owner told Daily Mail Australia. 'I was really shocked when police told me. We never expected anything like that in the day time. 'We're all baffled. When we go into town we go under the bridge and right past the toilets all the time. This is the first time (it's happened), that's for sure. 'I'm sure the poor woman is very traumatised. She came from school to go to the park and was taking her kid to the toilet... it's just a very sad thing.' The toilet where the attack took place has been described as 'dingy' and the park and surrounding area don't have any lights or CCTV cameras. The woman had taken her young daughter into the toilets (pictured) and was waiting for her when she was approached by an unknown man who knocked her unconscious to the floor and then raped her . While police initially believed the woman was indecently assaulted, medical tests have since revealed she was sexually assaulted while she was unconscious. The park where the woman was attacked is heavily populated with both tourists and local residents. 'When it’s good weather, a lot of people come with their kids. There’s quite a few people always in the park,' a resident said. Detectives said the park was no more of a concern than any other park in the area. Detectives in the sex crimes squad investigating the attack have now renewed their appeal for witnesses. She told detectives she asked her daughter to stay in the toilet cubicle with the door locked, before she was punched and knocked unconscious . While police initially believed the woman was indecently assaulted, medical tests have since revealed she was sexually assaulted while she was unconscious . He was also wearing a grubby white T-shirt, shorts and dirty white sneakers. The woman told police he also had a strong body odour and bad breath, and smelt of cigarettes and alcohol. Police want to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time of the attack, as well as anyone who might have seen a man fitting the description in the area in recent months. Due to a phone fault at Batemans Bay Police Station in late November, police are also appealing for anyone who was unsuccessful in contacting the station after the first media appeal to call again. Anyone with information should call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.

"Alison Steadman is tapping her fingers on the table and pursing her lips as she thinks about how different her life is now she’s well into her 60s. It takes her a while, but finally she comes up with an answer. ‘Obviously one has to slow down a little bit,’ she says with a grin. ‘I don’t go clubbing until 3am any more.’ It used to be that 40 was old for an actress, and anything over 60 was practically unheard of. But try telling that to 67-year-old Alison, who must be one of the hardest working people in television; fresh from her documentary about the wildlife of the Shetland Islands she’s down here on the Kent coast on the set of her new sitcom Boomers. The show follows the lives and loves of a group of 60-something baby boomers in a seaside town and is being talked about as the next Last Tango In Halifax. It begins with Alison’s character Joyce being forced to retire from her job as a receptionist. Joyce knows she’s going to miss being busy, and Alison can empathise. Alison Steadman, looking great at 67 as she prepares for a new role in sitcom Boomers, set in a seaside resort . Retirement’s a dirty word to her. ‘I try not to think about it,’ she says. ‘Actors are lucky because we don’t have to retire. We can if we want to, of course, and sometimes the business retires us, which is a bit sad. I do get tired occasionally, though, and think, “Why am I doing this?” After Boomers I’ve got another job coming up, and a play after that. There have been times I’ve turned things down and then wished I’d done them, but it’s nice to have a choice.’ She’s part of a terrific cast in Boomers, including Stephanie Beacham, Paula Wilcox and Russ Abbot, who play some of Joyce’s friends, while old stalwart Philip Jackson is her much put-upon husband Alan. Comedy legend June Whitfield, now 88, also appears, as the drink-guzzling Joan, the mother of Stephanie Beacham’s character Maureen. ‘June’s amazing, as sharp as anything,’ says Alison. ‘She’s a real example of what you can do if you’ve still got your health and your mind.’ The characters in Boomers seem very real – they are, after all, based on the family of writer Richard Pinto, whose previous credits include Fresh Meat and Citizen Khan. ‘One minute they’re getting on great, the next they’re having a little snipe,’ says Alison, laughing. ‘My character’s a bit of an organiser. She henpecks her husband. Poor guy, he can’t do anything right, so that made it fun to play. I hope I’m not the bully she is, but we all know couples like that.’ Each episode will follow one of the characters as they negotiate relationships, retirement and problems with their children or parents. ‘People will look at it and think, “I do that!” It’s very real,’ adds Alison. Above all, she’s pleased TV executives are finally realising there’s an older audience out there and making programmes to appeal to them. ‘I think they’ve probably done a few surveys and realised the majority of viewers are over 50. People in their 20s are often out and tend to watch TV through catch-up services. Alison as Mrs Bennet, with Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth, in the BBC's 1995 Pride And Prejudice . But the people who regularly sit in during the week are around my age. And that age group wants something it can relate to; we all like to be able to recognise ourselves on TV, don’t we? Life doesn’t stop once you reach a certain age and television bosses are seeing that. Your hopes and desires continue as they always have.’ It’s not just in the acting world that Alison is working hard; she’s also trying to launch a new career as a wildlife reporter. A lifelong birdwatcher who’s been known to get up at the crack of dawn to enjoy her hobby even when she’s filming a show, she’s only now getting the chance to show off this other side to her. Two recent TV projects – her Shetlands documentary on ITV and a series about how to find your way in the countryside without maps for the BBC a few years ago – represent just the thin end of the wedge of her ambitions. ‘I’d really like to do more wildlife things, particularly in conservation,’ she says. ‘I’ve been trying to do a show about the overuse of plastics for years but no one wants to make it. Creatures are choking on it.’ The Daily Mail has campaigned against supermarket plastic bags, and Alison says she’s passionate about getting the message across. ‘A lot of people are unaware of the nightmare that goes on in our seas,’ she says. Alison with Larry Lamb (far left) and Mathew Horne in hit sitcom Gavin & Stacey which ran from 2007 to 2010 . ‘If we could make everyone aware it might be our chance to change things. I read about this turtle that washed up on a beach in Mexico with around 280 carrier bags in its stomach. ‘Of course these bags look like jellyfish to a turtle. Apart from choking, they can starve to death because carrier bags aren’t biodegradable. They build up and the animals can’t get any nourishment so they get weaker and weaker – can you imagine what it’s like to die like that? This is happening to thousands of creatures, and most people aren’t aware of it. I see intelligent, educated people using 12 or 15 carrier bags every time they go to M&S or Waitrose. If you charge 10p a bag it doesn’t matter. Unless you charge £20 a bag people won’t stop.’ With her Boomers co-stars, much loved British actors Russ Abbot, Stephanie Beacham, James Smith, Paula Wilcox and Philip Jackson . She’s a surprise, is Alison Steadman. The Liverpool-born actress is softly spoken, but she’s clearly passionate about the world. The youngest of three girls, whose father was an electrical supervisor, she showed a talent for mimicry at a young age. She trained as a secretary and started work in a probation office, but hated it and applied for the East 15 drama school in Essex. Her audition report said, ‘worth training, will blossom’. Another pupil at the drama school was Mike Leigh who she met in her second year in 1966; he became her husband and father of her sons, director Toby, now 36, and cinematographer Leo, now 32. He was also to be her greatest collaborator. Their most famous joint enterprise was when Alison played the monstrous Beverly in Leigh’s Abigail’s Party on stage and TV. She’s since played a succession of opinionated ladies, including Pam in Gavin & Stacey, Mrs Bennet in Pride And Prejudice and now Joyce in Boomers. ‘Why do I get cast in these roles?’ she says with a laugh. ‘I’m a shrinking violet!’ Her marriage to Leigh lasted 22 years but the two were reportedly having problems when she met and fell in love with actor Michael Elwyn when he played her husband in the TV series No Bananas 18 years ago. They live in Highgate, north London, but she remains good friends with Leigh. She says she still feels young – in her downtime she wears jeans and trendy boots rather than ‘grannified’ dresses. She looks fantastic – although her good skin is entirely natural. She stopped using expensive face creams when she realised they didn’t make a jot of difference; she uses £3.99-a-pot Nivea. She’s always said she’d never have Botox or have a face-lift. Instead she credits her youthfulness with walking a lot and eating healthily. She seems to keep up with everything, including texting and emailing. ‘I like to keep in touch with the world,’ she says. ‘I love going to the theatre and the cinema and I don’t think I’d ever want to be in a situation where I was cut off from younger people.

"Most hoteliers have stories to tell about demanding, stroppy guests whose manners leave a lot to be desired. Jackie Ferrier, who runs an upmarket establishment in the heart of the New Forest, is no exception. The morning I visit, Sebastian — the guest in the hotel's most exclusive suite — was so eager for his room-service lunch that he launched himself at poor Jackie, swiping the plate clean out of her hand before rudely eating his lovingly prepared tuna dish from the floor. As for Sid — in a cheaper room down the corridor — well, he's already knocked his TV over and is making a racket as he sulkily kicks his remote control around the room. But none of it fazes Jackie. Nothing is too much trouble for her pampered guests, whether they have special dietary requirements, want to make Skype calls to loved ones... or just have their noses stroked and their tummies tickled. Pur-fect: Feline guests at Hotel Cat get their own human-sized beds . Creature comforts: The rooms are equipped with toys, beds and even a TV . Yes, the residents at this upmarket hotel may be somewhat lacking in manners, but they're not rowdy rock stars or drunken travelling salesmen. They are cats — much-loved family pets whose owners can't bear the thought of putting them in a cattery when they go away. Hotel Cat has been officially open for business for only a month, and it still has that fresh paint smell. At first glance, it could be a very select boutique hotel for humans — the kind you read about in glossy magazines. The reception area is clean and airy with a vase of brightly coloured flowers. The main hallway is lit by chandeliers, while a 6ft Christmas tree sparkles with fairy lights. It's not until you peer a little closer into the rooms and clock the toy mice, scratching posts and climbing frames that you realise who it's catering for. Hotel Cat is the brainchild of Jackie and Tim Ferrier, who ran a dog hotel in Devon along similar lines. They sold up, bought a 20-acre property in Hampshire, and describe themselves as 'the world's worst farmers' — buying animals and becoming too attached ever to slaughter or work them. No expense spared: It costs between £19 and £34 a night for cats to stay in their own suite . Pets deserve to be pampered: The hotel was the brainchild of Jackie and Tim Ferrier who were shocked by the way cats were treated in some catteries . Today they play host to a menagerie of chickens, ponies, sheep, goats and donkeys. It was after visiting a regular cattery earlier this year that Jackie realised the moggies have been missing out. She tells me: 'It was a well-known cattery, but I was appalled at the conditions the animals were kept in. 'The runs, in which they spend 24 hours, were tiny. They had no room to roam, explore or play. For a cat used to being outdoors, it would be particularly stressful. 'At least dogs in boarding kennels are taken out and walked every day, but cats are pretty much just fed and forgotten about. 'Our three cats are so much a part of the family, and I hated the idea of them being locked up like that.' Instead Jackie and Tim —who are helped out by their two animal-mad teenagers, James, 18, and Lucy, 16 —ploughed their savings into creating this top notch home-away-from-home for cats. The hotel comprises seven rooms, all 'en suite' — in that each leads to a private play area via a cat flap . Home-from-home: The family used their savings to make the hotel for cats a reality . Fun: The rooms contain every type of cat toy you can think of, from giant foam fish to plastic snakes and furry animals . Hotel Cat is a lavishly converted barn a stone's throw from the family's home. It comprises seven rooms, all 'en suite' — in that each leads to a private play area via a cat flap. Costing between £19 and £34 a night, all suites have a flat-screen TV and DVD player, cushions and a proper human bed — not a basket — with a duvet and blanket. That's not all. The rooms contain every type of cat toy you can think of, from giant foam fish to plastic snakes and furry animals. Bedrooms are heated to a tropical 70F and there's a choice of entertainment, from movies to music. I wouldn't have thought your average cat was too fussed about entertainment, but the occupiers of the Royal Mews prove me wrong. Sebastian, a silver tabby, is transfixed by The Little Rascals, playing on his DVD. 'They respond to the sound and moving images,' says Jackie. 'People always assume cats just take care of themselves. It's true that cats are much lower maintenance than dogs, but they're not total loners.' Sebastian shares his suite with Sweep and Stella, a pair of short-haired Persians with whom he usually lives in Central London. Peace of mind: Owners know their cats are being well-cared for while they go away . Relaxed: This cat clearly finds his bed comfortable following a bedtime story . Luxury: All the rooms have en suites and room service serving seafood canapes . The trio have been at Hotel Cat for six months — before it officially opened — as their owners, a solicitor and his wife, are caught in the middle of a complicated house move. By my reckoning it's cost more than £8,000, which would buy you a week in a suite at the Dorchester. But what price peace of mind? Jackie emails owners weekly bulletins, detailing their cats' health, mood and food intake. And when it comes to food, the Hotel Cat lives up to its five-star billing. There are seafood canapés from £4, or smoked salmon and prawns in seafood sauce for £6. All dishes are served with mineral water (no cloudy tap water for these VIPs). Wish you were here: Jackie emails owners weekly bulletins, detailing their cats' health, mood and food intake or they can Skype . Despite the expense, Hotel Cat is fully booked for Christmas. Residents can expect to wake up to a stocking filled with presents, followed by a gourmet turkey dinner. 'The message is loud and clear,' Jackie says. 'Owners really dislike traditional catteries. So many people have said: 'Finally we can go on holiday without worrying.' With that, she starts her wind-down routine for her guests. Soothing music is played, lights are dimmed, litter trays are emptied, and the cats are gently stroked while bedtime stories are read. Never mind the animals, this place is the cat's whiskers.","Hotel Cat is open for business in the heart of the New Forest .

"A  man who claimed to have a bomb while boarding a flight from Slovakia to London Luton airport was allowed to get on the plane by staff who dismissed him as merely being drunk. The 30-year-old was boarding a Whizz Air flight on December 7 when he told security officials that he had 'a bomb and grenades' in his luggage. Incredibly, security allowed him to board the plane and it  was only when he repeated his claims to the cabin crew that he was removed from the flight because staff refused to fly with him. The man told security staff at Propad airport in Slovakia that he had 'a bomb and grenades' in his luggage, but was allowed to board the Whizz Air flight to London Luton airport and dismissed as being drunk . The man, who has not been named, was detained at Poprad Airport in northern Slovakia, which has previously attracted controversy for security breaches. In January 2010 officials at the airport caused a major security scare after putting a fake explosive device into a man's luggage during routine training for sniffer dogs. The dogs found the device, but after the training had finished authorities forgot to take it out again, and allowed him to board a plane to Dublin, where he was arrested as a suspected terrorist. The man was only released after Slovakian police admitted what they had done to Irish authorities. Police spokesman Daniel Dzobanik said : 'During the process of getting onto the plane flying from Poprad to London, the passenger told the stewardess that he carried a bomb. 'These claims were later found to be untrue.' Propad airport has previously been in trouble for security breaches after officials accidentally left a fake explosive device in a man's bag after using it for training, before allowing him on to a flight . The plane was allowed to continue on its way after the man's luggage was removed and he had been arrested. Officers tested the man and found that he was four times over the legal drink drive limit. Poprad Airport spokesperson Ivana Herkelova denied they had done anything wrong in allowing the man to board the plane obviously drunk and after having claimed to have been carrying explosives. The man now faces charges of interfering with public transport by making false threats.","Man, 30, was trying to board flight from Propad to London Luton airport .

"With six of its fleet experiencing technical problems in the last week, it's no secret that Qantas has had a turbulent week. Four flights were forced to make emergency landings on Monday and Tuesday due to technical problems. A fifth and sixth plane experienced mechanical and technical issues in Canberra yesterday, causing major disruptions at the airport. One union is claiming that recent changes at the airline, including cuts to the workforce and outsourcing of maintenance work, have had a knock-on effect to the safety of the planes. Scroll down for video . Unions have piped up claiming controversial changes at the airline, involving cuts to the workforce and outsourcing of maintenance work have had a knock-on effect on the safety of the planes . Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Trade Workers Union National Secretary Tony Sheldon said he believes that maintenance standards have been slipping at the national carrier and claimed that the majority of maintenance engineers overseas working on Qantas planes are unlicensed. According to Mr Sheldon, the outsourcing of maintenance overseas now means that Qantas has less direct control over its employees and that this situation has had a knock-on effect to operations and safety. Trade Workers Union National Secretary Tony Sheldon said standards have been slipping at the national carrier due to it's maintenance operations and claimed the majority of maintenance engineers overseas working on Qantas planes are unlicensed . 'Submissions to a Senate enquiry show there is a much higher ratio of unlicensed to licensed engineers performing maintenance in outsourced Asian facilities than in Australia,' Mr Sheldon said. 'An efficient airline needs to be profitable with a well maintained aircraft fleet, but this appears to be wanting after what has happened,' he said. Mr Sheldon urged Qantas management to sit down with its workforce to ensure standards are maintained. Mr Sheldon urged Qantas management to sit down with its workforce to ensure standards are maintained so that Qantas remains viable in the future. 'This is an airline with a great reputation but the decision to strip back its highly experienced workforce has lowered standards.' he said. However, Qantas have rubbished Mr Sheldon's claims, stating that each of their planes must pass Civil Aviation Safety Authority standards before they are deemed safe enough to fly. A Qantas spokesperson said the airline always strived to put the safety of their passengers first and that the carrier is one of the most regulated in the world. However, Qantas have rubbished Mr Sheldon's claims, stating that each of their planes must pass Civil Aviation Safety Authority standards before they are deemed safe enough to fly . 'This all needs to be put into context – every single airline around the world experiences diversions and air turnbacks from time to time. 'Modern aircraft are very sophisticated but they are also very complex, sometimes things do happen that result in airlines diverting as a precaution.' Qantas spokeswoman Sharna Rhys-Jones told Daily Mail Australia that the majority of Qantas maintenance is carried out in Australia. Qantas spokeswoman Sharna Rhys-Jones told Daily Mail Australia that the majority of Qantas maintenance is carried out in Australia . However, due to lack of resources at Australian facilities, a number of international planes are maintained overseas. Ms Rhys-Jones said the offshore facilities are dedicated maintenance facilities and Australian engineers are sent overseas with the planes to oversee their upkeep. She said that there are specialist Qantas engineers at all international ports who are on-hand to provide maintenance work to the vast fleet . 'The aviation industry is one of the most highly-regulated industries in the world. All maintenance on Australian aircraft needs to be conducted at facilities approved by Australia's aviation safety regulator, CASA – whether it be onshore or offshore,' Ms Rhys-Jones said. 'Regardless of geography, all our maintenance is done at facilities approved by CASA and to Qantas' high standards.' Geoffrey Thomas, Editor-In-Chief of Airlineratings.com and aviation expert told Daily Mail Australia that he believes the Trade Workers Union is using scaremongering tactics to instill fear into the Australian public. 'They’re putting the fear of death into people that are flying and 60% of people who fly have a fear of flying."" He said the Qantas group operates around 1000 flights a day and blames social media for the high level of attention the recent Qantas blunders received. 'Their turnback rate on the Boeing 737 is half the world average,' he said. It had begun as a positive day for Qantas when CEO Alan Joyce announced a half-year profit of between $300 and $350 million. Geoffrey Thomas, Editor-In-Chief of Airlineratings.com and aviation expert told Daily Mail Australia that he believes the Trade Workers Union is using scaremongering tactics, aiming to instil fear in the Australian public . 'Their engine shut down rate is well below the world average and a couple of times it's world leading for the lowest number of shut downs, so the actual hard numbers don’t support the prognosis that there’s a problem at Qantas.' Chaos ensued this week after the six flights were grounded due to technical issues. One plane had an issue with the warning system in the cockpit and was grounded for two hours at Hobart Airport. Another flight travelling from Sydney to Dallas was forced to return to Sydney four hours into its journey. On Monday, two aircraft were forced to land at Perth Airport in two separate incidents. In the early hours of the morning, a Dubai-to-Sydney flight was forced to land when air pressure in the cabin suddenly dropped. Later that day, a domestic Qantas flight was turned back to Perth due to a 'strange odour' in the cabin. The week began with good news for the airline, when Qantas CEO Alan Joyce announced that the airline is likely to post a first-half profit, sending the airline's shares 14 per cent higher.","Six flights have been grounded due to technical difficulties in the last week .

"A  helicopter pilot has been kicked out of the RAF for taking cocaine at a party where he boasted to a female colleague of his drug-fuelled sexual exploits. Squadron Leader Michael Hayes, 43, who has flown dangerous missions around the world, snorted the drug at a 1970s-themed fancy dress party at RAF Odiham in Hampshire. A group of officers downed cocktails, wine, champagne and spirits at the pre-Christmas gathering in the mess before continuing the festivities in Hayes’s room. Squadron Leader Michael Hayes, 43, has been kicked out of the RAF for taking cocaine at a party where he boasted to a female colleague of his drug-fuelled sexual exploits . The divorcee, who has a seven-year-old son, had been accused of supplying the drug but instead was convicted of the lesser charge of possession, which he had admitted. He was dismissed from his £50,000-a-year post following a 24-year career at a sentencing hearing yesterday. The criminal record will also prevent him from becoming a commercial pilot. Judge Advocate Michael Elsom told him: ‘Those in possession put at risk not just their lives but the lives of those with whom they serve. Continued service in the RAF as far as you are concerned is impossible.’ His fall from grace happened on December 9 last year when officers shared a meal together and played drinking games. Flight Lieutenant Kayleigh Warriner described how Hayes made lurid claims about his love life as they chatted at the mess bar. ‘I asked him about a woman who had been in the mess a couple of times with him,’ she said. ‘He said they weren’t exclusive to each other. He mentioned an incident in the mess where he said he nearly had a threesome with this woman and another female.’ She asked whether it had been ‘awkward’ afterwards and he said: ‘That’s what coke does to you.’ The junior officer said the conversation turned to drugs again when she joined about a dozen other people in Hayes’s room in the base’s living quarters. He ‘kept mentioning it’ and Flt Lt Warriner said she challenged him, saying: ‘Well, show me then.’ The hearing at Colchester Garrison in Essex was told they walked into his bedroom where he took out a ‘pale, square-shaped’ wrap and said: ‘What do you think? We could do it right now.’ Flight lieutenant Emily Mather described falling asleep on Hayes’s sofa. She later woke to see everyone had left except Hayes and a flying officer and noticed there were ‘lines of white powder on the table’. ‘At one point Squadron Leader Hayes stated something along the lines of “I can’t believe we’ve done the whole gram of coke. I think we should get more for Friday”,’ she said. RAF Police raided the squadron leader’s room later that morning after colleagues reported him. A search found evidence of cocaine use and Hayes, of High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, was arrested. He later failed a drugs test. Christopher Martin, representing Hayes, said his client was not a ‘habitual user’ of drugs. Flying Officer David Sinclair, of Carshalton, south-west London, was cleared of possessing cocaine and conduct prejudicial to good order.","Michael Hayes snorted the drug at a 1970s-themed fancy dress party .

"Chancellor George Osborne announced a new ‘diverted profits tax’ in last week's Autumn Statement . A new ‘Google tax’ on giant US firms shifting their profits abroad was ridiculed today after it emerged businesses will have to report themselves to the taxman. The levy, which was introduced by George Osborne in last week’s Autumn Statement, is overwhelmingly backed by the public. But it emerged today that under the new scheme companies will be asked to ‘self-report’ how much tax they have avoided. One tax expert said: ‘It's a bit like reporting yourself to the police and then having to defend yourself.’ Chas Roy-Chowdhury, head of taxation at the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, added: ‘It seems strange that multinationals would have to report themselves and the the onus is on them to defend their [tax activities.]’ But a Treasury source stressed the new tax would be hard to avoid. 'This is a legal requirement. We are going to check up on it and it will be enforced,' the source said. The Treasury estimates the Google tax will raise just £25million in 2015-16 – rising to £355million by 2019-20. Mr Osborne last week claimed the new ‘diverted profits tax’ – targeting firms who ‘export’ profits to countries with lower corporation taxes than Britain – would raise £1billion over five years. Many large technology companies are based in Ireland due to the country's 12.5 per cent corporation tax. The same tax in the UK is 20 per cent. Despite the controversy over the tax the Government will take encouragement from new polling which reveals it is the most popular policy included in the Autumn Statement last week. According to a new ComRes/ITV News poll six in ten Britons say the new tax on the profits of companies who operate in the UK but transfer their profits offshore is good for them personally. The plans, outlined in the Autumn Statement, aim to clamp down on companies such as Google and Facebook who declare their profits in countries with lower taxes than the UK. The ‘Google tax’ was even more popular than the stamp duty cuts announced by Mr Osborne. The publication of the new rules comes after Washington’s ambassador to the UK vigorously defended Google and other multinational firms yesterday. Matthew Barzun leapt to the defence of the giant corporations which have come under fire for their tax policies, saying they were simply following international tax rules laid down by governments. David Cameron warned in October that multinationals which exploit loopholes to avoid paying UK taxes would be made to ‘damn well pay’. American ambassador Matthew Barzun told journalists  it was wrong to describe the firms as ‘international tax dodgers’ Google Chairman Eric Schmidt has previously said if tax rules were to change his firm  'will comply' Mr Barzun told journalists in Westminster it was wrong to describe the firms as ‘international tax dodgers’ despite the fact they pay little, if any, corporation tax in this country. ‘I’m not the spokesman for any of those great American companies,’ he said. ‘These companies and other companies… are clever about using international rules that exist, as written, by the way, by all of us – that’s US government, British government – we make these rules and they are playing by them. ‘And I hope that if and when rules change they will play by those new rules as well.’ Facebook is reported to have paid no corporation tax in the UK for the last two years. Google, which generated more than £3.5billion from the UK last year, paid just over £20million in corporation tax. And Amazon, which sold goods worth £4.3billion in the UK last year, paid just £4.2million. The firms all insist that they are operating within the international tax rules. But their behaviour has sparked mounting anger in the UK.","Levy was introduced by George Osborne in last week’s Autumn Statement .

"The US government infiltrated Cuba's hip hop scene in a botched attempt at overthrowing communist president Raul Castro, a report has revealed. It came after failed efforts to develop a Cuban version of Twitter and exploding cigars. In a bid to 'break the information blockade' and spark a youth movement against the government, the USAID spent two years targeting unwitting musicians who had shown themselves to be critical of Castro's administration, the Associated Press has learned. The scheme was masterminded by a Washington, DC,-based contractor which employed a team of Serbians key to the youth movement that overthrew former president Slobodan Milosevic in 2000. But despite working so secretly that even the Treasury was unaware, the operation was amateurish and profoundly unsuccessful. Scroll down for video . Recruited: Los Aldeanos - Bian Rodriguez, left, and Aldo Rodriguez, right - were allegedly unaware that the US government was using them to create a youth movement against President Raul Castro's government . On at least six occasions, Cuban authorities detained or interrogated people involved in the operation, documents read by the AP revealed. They also confiscated computer hardware, which in some cases contained information that endangered Cubans who are thought to have had no idea they were caught up in the clandestine programme. Ultimately, the plot compromised Cuba's vibrant hip-hop culture which has produced some of the hardest-hitting grassroots criticism since Fidel Castro came to power in 1959. Artists targeted by USAID for the scheme have been driven out of the country under pressure from the Cuban government. The program is laid out in documents involving Creative Associates International, a Washington, D.C., contractor paid millions of dollars to undermine Cuba's communist government. The thousands of pages include contracts, emails, preserved chats, budgets, expense reports, power points, photographs and passports. The work included the creation of a 'Cuban Twitter' social network and the dispatch of inexperienced Latin American youth to recruit activists, operations that were the focus of previous AP stories. USAID denied the allegations on Wednesday in a statement that read: 'Any assertions that our work is secret or covert are simply false.' Its programs, the statement added, were aimed at strengthening civil society 'often in places where civic engagement is suppressed and where people are harassed, arrested, subjected to physical harm or worse.' Creative Associates did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Danger: Los Aldeanos' Aldo Rodriguez, left, and Bian Rodriguez, center, perform in concert at the Acapulco Theater in Havana, Cuba. Documents reveal an unaware Aldo was detained during the operation . Scouted: The rappers were recruited for their critical lyrics in songs such as Long Live Free Cuba! At first, the hip-hop operation was run in Cuba by Serbian contractor Rajko Bozic. His project was inspired by the protest concerts of the student movement that helped undermine former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in 2000. Nine years later, Bozic headed public relations for Serbia's EXIT Festival, an annual music event that had grown out of the student movement. Bozic spoke to the AP earlier this year but declined to talk about the Cuba program. The Serb homed in swiftly on Los Aldeanos, a hip-hop group frustrated by official pressure and widely respected by Cuban youth for its hard-hitting lyrics. 'People marching blind, you have no credibility,' the group rapped in 'Long Live Free Cuba!' 'Go and tell the captain — this ship's sinking rapidly.' Creative used a Panama front company and a bank in Lichtenstein to hide the money trail from Cuba, where thousands of dollars went to fund a TV program starring Los Aldeanos. It would be distributed on DVDs to circumvent Cuba's censors. Then the Colombian rock star Juanes announced a September 2009 concert in the heart of Havana. Creative managers held a two-day strategy session on how to persuade Juanes to let Los Aldeanos perform with him. It didn't happen, but Juanes publicly thanked the rappers after the concert and was photographed with them. The contractors were pleased; they believed this kind of public support by a major celebrity would protect Los Aldeanos from state pressure. In a statement Wednesday, a Juanes spokesman, John Reilly, said that the concert had no political agenda and that 'Juanes and the other organizing artists did not have any knowledge' of what others did. Later the month of the concert, Los Aldeanos' charismatic front man, Aldo Rodriguez, was detained for illegal possession of a computer. Xavier Utset, who ran the program for Creative, saw the arrest as a 'perfect test' of whether raising Aldo's profile would keep out of jail. In the end, a relative of Aldo's phoned Silvio Rodriguez, himself a legendary singer. Rodriguez, in an AP interview in Havana, said he called a friend in Cuba's Culture Ministry and asked for the computer to be returned. If there was a problem, he told the friend, 'tell them I gave them the computer as a present.' 'Evidently he did what I said,' Rodriguez said. 'I never imagined that a program like this could exist... When you find out you could be surrounded by a conspiracy, it's shocking.' At one point, the contractors approached a government sex education institute run by President Raul Castro's daughter, Mariela, to be part of the EXIT Festival in Serbia, even as its organizers were running the anti-Castro hip-hop operation. One contractor said it would be 'mind blowing' to be working with the president's family. Mariela Castro told the AP that her institute sent two representatives to the festival but didn't build deeper ties because the festival 'didn't have anything to do with the work we were doing.' Contractors paid $15,000 to underwrite an arts and music festival put on by the family of Pablo Milanes, the famed singer of 'nueva trova' music and a man with close government ties. Mastermind: Documents show Rajko Bozic, a key member in the youth movement that overthrew Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic, was employed by a Washington, DC, contractor to do the same in Cuba . Scared: Cuban musician Silvio Rodriguez, a relative of Los Aldeanos' Aldo Rodriguez, said they were all unaware of the operation and he had to persuade authorities to release Aldo after he was detained . Their secret aim was to seed 'the minds of festival organizers with new ideas' and persuade them to send 'high-impact messages' to the audience, read one report. Milanes' daughter, Suylen Milanes, said government officials showed up the day before the festival and warned her that she was associating with unsavory characters. They even showed her copies of Bozic's emails, which they called suspicious, she recalled. Her father declined to comment. Clearly, Cuban officials had figured out what was going on. Bozic was detained coming into Havana with equipment, including a potentially incriminating memory stick, generating anxiety among the contractors. He cut his trip short and other contractors were told he wouldn't be returning soon. Then, Cuban authorities detained a photographer working with Adrian Monzon, the only Cuban who documents show knowingly worked for Creative Associates on the hip-hop program. State security then interrogated Monzon, a video jockey. He told Creative that the Cuban authorities were worried about Bozic and suspected links to the CIA. Four months later, Los Aldeanos left Cuba for their first trip off the island to perform at the EXIT festival in Serbia. On the side, they were the unwitting recipients of leadership training meant 'to focus them a little more on their role as agents of social mobilization,' wrote Utset, a veteran of Cuban pro-democracy efforts. Shut down: Contractors paid $15,000 to underwrite an arts and music festival put on by the family of Pablo Milanes (pictured), the famed singer of 'nueva trova' music and a man with close government ties . Monzon was detained again returning to Havana in April 2011, his computer and a memory stick seized. When they were returned, he realized they contained a document with the names of two Creative Associates managers. It was a devastating blow. Monzon and Utset did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Aldo would only say that his 'conscience is clear.' While Bozic spoke with AP about his work with the EXIT festival, he did not respond to requests for comment on his Cuba work. In August 2010, Los Aldeanos took the stage at Rotilla, one of Cuba's largest independent music festivals. Before a crowd of about 15,000 people, they lacerated government officials by name and taunted the police. 'The police instead of making me hate them, inspire pity, because they are such sh--- eaters they don't even realize they are victims of the system. Viva Cuba libre,' Aldo's partner rapped. Within months, a USAID contractor told his handlers that the Cubans said USAID had infiltrated the festival, and soon enough, the Cubans took it over. . In the end, Los Aldeanos moved to South Florida after complaining that the Cuban government made it impossible for them to work in their own country. Their most recently published lyrics are softer-edged. In slickly produced videos, Aldo plays with dogs and children, making only scattered political references as he raps about helping people love each other, and making the world a better place.","USAID spent two years backing Cuban artists who were critical of Castro .

"Former suspect Robert Murat attended an Algarve police station today over the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. The IT consultant, 41, was driven into Faro Police Station through a back entrance just before 9.30am along with his German-born wife Michaela Walczuch, 38, and their lawyer Francisco Pagarete. None made any comment in the morning or at midday, when they were driven out in a different vehicle for a short lunch before returning for the afternoon. Scroll down for video . Robert Murat (right) and his wife leave Faro's Police Station inside a car after being interviewed as witnesses during an investigation on the Madeleine McCann case . Mr Murat, who is not suspected of any involvement in Madeleine's disappearance, was called in for questioning on the second day of a fresh round of police interviews requested by Scotland Yard detectives. Portuguese police acting on behalf of the Operation Grange officers began questioning Michaela, Mr Murat's girlfriend when Madeleine disappeared, as a witness soon after her morning arrival. They also quizzed Silvia Batista, who ran the service and maintenance departments at the Ocean Club holiday complex in the resort of Praia da Luz where Madeleine was staying with her family. British expat Murat, made a formal suspect or arguido days after Madeleine went missing on May 3 2007 before being cleared a year later, said last month when it emerged police wanted to question him that he was happy to cooperate. Speaking before he received his official notification, he said: 'My conscience is clear and I have no problem speaking to police again.' His wife's quiz was the first time she has had to face Scotland Yard questions but the fourth time in all she has been questioned by police as a witness. Portuguese police took three statements from her within three weeks of Madeleine's disappearance. A Portuguese lorry driver later came forward to say he had seen a blonde woman he said resembled estate agent Michaela passing a blanket he was convinced contained a child over a fence on an Algarve farm the day after Madeleine vanished. Spanish tourist Isabel Gonzalez also claimed she had spotted her in a town in northern Morocco in June 2007, moments after she had seen a girl who looked just like Madeleine. Robert Murat's lawyer said at the time he and his then-girlfriend were having their names dragged through the mud on a daily basis. Michaela dismissed as 'ridiculous' claims she had been spotted with the missing girl in Morocco, insisting she was lunching with Mr Murat and his lawyer that day. The pretty blonde, whose home was searched by Portuguese police after Madeleine disappeared, went on to complain of being treated like dirt by detectives and claim Kate and Gerry McCann's former detective agency Metodo 3 had cynically used her. British investigators carry food to Faro's Police Station at lunch time . Head of the Policia Judiciaria in the Algarve, Luis Mota Carmo, leaves Faro's Police Station as the Madeleine case is re-investigated . Investigation: Last month it emerged the British police investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann (pictured) has cost almost £8million . Protesting her innocence in a December 2007 interview with a UK newspaper, she said: 'I lost my faith not just in justice but in the whole system and everyone that supports it. 'The worst part is people putting me in this, knowing I have nothing to do with it. 'They have no feelings, no heart. They are completely empty. 'When Robert called me to tell me that there was a story about these sightings I went into town and I just saw my face on the front of all the papers. I felt sick.' 'I just wanted to go all around the town screaming, ""It wasn't me.""' Silvia Batista, former head of the service and maintenance departments at the Ocean Club holiday complex but now unemployed, was the first person to turn up for questioning this morning. She was followed into the station by the Scotland Yard detectives who arrived in two groups. Mrs Batista, one of 11 people due to be questioned this week as witnesses, was one of the first people on the scene after being alerted to Madeleine's disappearance. She told police she found the youngster's heart specialist dad Gerry 'hitting the floor with both hands' and 'screaming with anger' when she reached apartment 5A where Madeleine had been sleeping with twin siblings Sean and Amelie. She also said Gerry told her he had closed the windows of their bedroom - open when Madeleine's disappearance was discovered - because the twins, then 18 months, were still asleep in separate cots. The police quizzes taking place this week are the first since four men were questioned as arguidos at the start of July. All four - who included Russian businessman Sergey Malinka and a schizophrenic heroin addict - insisted they had nothing to do with Madeleine McCann's disappearance. Three men including rapist pig farmer Joaquim Jose Marques were questioned yesterday as witnesses. Probe: DCI Andy Redwood (left) has arrived in Faro, Portugal to oversee the questioning of 11 witnesses over the disappearance of Madeleine McCann (file photo, right) Vanished: Madeleine McCann was three years old when she disappeared from her holiday resort in Praia da Luz (pictured) in May 2007 . Three more people are due to be questioned tomorrow as witnesses on the last day of the police interviews. Respected Portuguese newspaper Correio da Manha reported today that the unnamed British wife of one of the witnesses has already been questioned in the UK. British police believe Madeleine was killed during a bungled burglary, a theory their Portuguese counterparts who are conducting their own parallel investigation into Madeleine's disappearance have privately rubbished. Parts of the Praia da Luz resort where the youngster vanished were dug up in June at Scotland Yard's request in a grim search for her body - but failed to yield any clues. DCI Nicola Wall, from the Met Police's Homicide and Major Crime Command Unit, will take charge of the British police investigation into Madeleine's disappearance from Andy Redwood on December 22 when he retires. She is expected to fly to the Algarve tomorrow to meet Portuguese police chiefs and get a briefing on how the week's interviews have gone.","Robert Murat arrived at an Algarve police station this morning .

"This is the awkward moment when one of the men behind Britain's first cereal cafe was challenged over selling bowls for £3.20 - just feet away from one of London's poorest areas. Gary Keely, who founded Cereal Killer Cafe with his twin brother Alan, appeared surprised to learn that the restaurant was located in the deprived borough of Tower Hamlets during a TV interview. The out-of-touch hipster even claimed that the niche cafe, which opened earlier this week, was 'cheap'. Scroll down for video . Awkward: Gary Keely (above), who founded Cereal Killer Cafe with his twin brother Alan, appeared surprised to learn that the restaurant was located in the deprived borough of Tower Hamlets during a TV interview . Challenged: The cafe-owner (left in white) said that his prices were 'cheap' for the area when questioned by a journalist from Channel 4 (right). Small bowls of cereal start at £2.50 . Defensive: After being repeatedly asked about whether he thought people in the area could afford to eat in the cafe, Mr Keely demands that the interview is stopped, saying he 'doesn't like the questions' The cringe-worthy encounter was captured on camera by Channel 4, who spoke to the identical twins on whether local residents could afford to eat at their cafe. The brothers, from Belfast, opened their venture on Brick Lane - a hipster hotspot and home to a number of quirky cafes. But the east London borough is one of the capital's poorest, where more one in two children grow up living in poverty. The establishment is heavy on the nostalgia, with limited-edition boxes and collectibles proudly displayed on furniture reminiscent of yesteryear. The eighties and nineties 'vibe', which is also driving trends in fashion and music, continues with the music choices and vintage magazines. The cafe also employs a 'mixologist' - who combines different types of cereal for customers looking for something different. After tasting one of the 120 varieties on offer, priced at £3.20, the journalist asks Gary whether he thought it was a lot to charge for a bowl. Hipster: The Cereal Killer cafe was founded by identical twins Alan (right) and Gary Keely from Belfast . Niches: Along with 120 varieties of cereal, the restaurant also offers 20 toppings and 12 different milk options . The restaurateur seems surprised by the question, responding, 'I think it is quite cheap for the area'. He is challenged by the interviewer, who points out that the cafe is in one of the poorest parts of London - and asks again whether £3 seemed like a premium price. Mr Keely looks to justify the extraordinary cost, explaining that many of the brands are 'imported from America'. The interviewer then asks what this means for the people who live in the area, where the proportion of children living in poverty has nearly reached 50 per cent. Mr Keely responds: 'This isn't one of the poorest areas, is it?' Deprived: The cafe, pictured above, is in Tower Hamlets, where one in two children live in poverty . Imported: Mr Keely says that the reason the cereals cost so much is because some are American brands . The journalist clarifies that it is one of the poorest areas, and asks again whether he thought local people would be able to afford £3.20 cereal. Mr Keely responds, 'Well, if they are poor, probably not then.' The cafe owner becomes defensive and starts asking to stop the interview because 'he doesn't like the questions'. The interviewer says that he thinks the questions are fair, but the clip ends shortly after. Earlier this week, the Keelys spoke about the reason behind opening their cereal cafe. Gary said: 'We thought ""Why isn't there anywhere that you can just go and sit down and have a bowl of cereal?"" 'So we went and did some research into it – would it work as a business? How would it look? Where would we get the cereal from? And everything was just ticking all the boxes for us. The cafe is open from 7am until 10pm and serves breakfast, lunch and dinner - meaning cereal aficionados can get their fix pretty much anytime of day. Behind the counter, brightly-coloured boxes line the walls and offerings are as diverse as Golden Grahams and Reese's Puffs to Cap'n Crunch and Apple Jacks. Asked about his favourite cereal, he said: 'I really love the Boo-berry, Count Chocula and Franken-berry – these are limited-edition Halloween cereals that are only available one month of the year in America. 'We've got these, but really limited-edition, so we've only got about 20 boxes of them.' Located in east London, Tower Hamlets has the highest rate of child poverty in the country - it reached 49 per cent this year, up from 42 per cent last year. It also has the second highest unemployment rate in London. Every ward has a higher proportion of people claiming out of work benefits than the London average. But the problems are by no means confined to the economic - Tower Hamlets also has very high rates of long term illness and premature death. Yet this is only half the picture. Tower Hamlets also has some of the highest paid people in London, working in the financial district of Canary Wharf, which has European headquarters for HSBC, Citibank and Barclays. The proportion of jobs in Tower Hamlets that are low paid is one of the smallest in the capital. The borough also boasts booming Brick Lane, which lies at the centre of Britain's hipster culture and is home to a number of quirky bars and restaurants. At a number of these establishments, including the Cereal Killer Cafe, customers can expect to pay a premium for the out-of-the-ordinary experiences. Just down the road from Cereal Killer Cafe is Lady Dinah's Cat Emporium. There, visitors pay £5 to book a table in the cafe, which is home to a number of rescue cats.","Cereal Killer Cafe sells 120 varieties of cereal and a small bowl costs £2.50 .

"John Ankers, 40, was arrested outside a Tesco store in Hattersley, near Hyde, Greater Manchester, after trying to punch an officer during Black Friday sales . The first shopper in Britain to be prosecuted over 'retail rioting' after he threw a punch at a police officer during a scramble for bargains in the Black Friday sales has walked free from court. John Ankers, 40, was arrested outside a Tesco store in Hattersley, near Hyde, Greater Manchester, after swinging a punch at police as he tried to buy cheap alcohol. He, along with hundreds of shoppers, charged the store after it opened its doors just after midnight on Friday, November 28. He was arrested for threatening behaviour, but escaped a prison sentence at Tameside Magistrates' Court today where he was ordered to pay more than £200 in fines and costs. Officers who had been called to the supermarket at five past midnight on Black Friday following reports of fighting in the store, found 300 people scrambling for bargains when they arrived at the scene. Ankers arrived just as police advised staff to close the shop, which came just five minutes after its opening, to help restore order among customers. When told by a police officer he could not enter the shop to buy anything, Ankers retorted: 'Who closed it I bet it was you f****** lot'. He then added: 'Do you want a f****** go, let's have a f****** fight, that field outside'. Ankers then swung a fist towards the officer, narrowly missing his head and shouted 'come on then' before being arrested, the court heard. It was one of seven incidents of public disorder involving Tesco shops across Greater Manchester during Black Friday's infamous rush for heavily-discounted items. At the time, the mass sale sparked fury from the county's chief constable Sir Peter Fahy who condemned supermarkets for 'creating situations where officers had to deal with crushing, disorder and disputes between customers'. The Black Friday phenomenon has spread to the UK in recent years after becoming a big hit in the U.S., where traditionally big sales occur on the first Friday after the Thanksgiving holiday. Ankers, from Hyde, Greater Manchester, pleaded guilty to using threatening behaviour and was fined £110 with £85 costs at court today. He was also told he must pay a victim surcharge of £20. After the court hearing he said 'I've been vilified,' but refused to comment any further. During the hearing, prosecutor Miss Claire Harris outlined Ankers' actions leading up to his arrest. She told the court: 'The defendant tried to enter the store to try and buy alcohol. He was informed by officers it was closed. He said, 'who closed it I bet it was you f****** lot'. 'He muttered something under his breath and walked out. A few minutes later police were alerted to a commotion in the foyer. 'The defendant was stood there. He saw the officer that he had previously spoken to and said 'do you want a f****** go, let's have a f****** fight, that field outside'. The officer asked what his problem was and began to usher him out of the store. 'He swung a fist towards the officer, narrowly missing his head. He shouted 'come on then'. He was taken to the ground and arrested.' Ankers, from Hyde, Greater Manchester (pictured outside court), pleaded guilty to using threatening behaviour and was fined £110 with £85 costs today. He was also told he must pay a victim surcharge of £20 . The incident occurred at the Tesco Extra store in Hattersley, Greater Manchester (pictured), on Black Friday . The court heard how Ankers has 13 previous convictions for 23 offences, six of which are for public order offences. The last offence was committed in January last year when he broke into a police station while drunk in a bid to steal computers. Mr Russell Wild, mitigating, said Ankers had accepted he has anger management issues. He told the court: 'His perception of matters were that police were singling him out. 'He accepted that he acted aggressively and doesn't seek to excuse his actions. Sir Peter Fahy, chief constable of Greater Manchester Police, condemned supermarkets for 'creating situations where officers had to deal with crushing, disorder and disputes' on Black Friday . 'He also accepts that he has anger management problems and has been on a course for this through his doctor. He is aware that there is a problem and he is trying to do something about it.' His arrest was one of several incidents in connection with 'retail rioting' during last month's Black Friday. Two other men, both from Manchester, are currently awaiting trial for assault over disturbances during the sales. Black Friday descended into chaos at many stores in the Greater Manchester area, with police being called to Tesco stores in Wigan, Salford, Stretford, Walkden and Failsworth, among others. At the time, Sir Peter said the events were 'totally predictable' and said he was disappointed that stores did not have 'sufficient' security staff on duty. He said: 'This created situations where we had to deal with crushing, disorder and disputes between customers. 'It does not help that this was in the early hours when police resources are already stretched. 'Across Greater Manchester large supermarkets already make significant demands on policing through calls to shoplifting, anti-social behaviour and thefts of fuel from their petrol stations - much of which is preventable. 'We just ask these stores to work with us to reduce the demands on policing and reduce the risks of disorder and crime.'","John Ankers was arrested outside Tesco after trying to punch police officer .

"The emerald green cat spotted on the streets of Varna, Bulgaria, has been reported missing after dazzling locals and becoming an internet sensation thanks to its striking coat. The cat has reportedly not been seen for two to three days, raising fears that it has been snatched. Although the unusual colour of the feline was initially thought to have been caused by an act of  cruelty, reports emerged the green shine was from  paint at the construction yard where it sleeps. It was originally believed the cat was painted by cruel owners so as to stand out in the crowds . But it later emerged the feline was falling asleep on paint in the yard where it lived . Given its recent popularity, some are worried the cat may have been abducted. However, locals report seeing a green cat around the same time last year, but say they think rain washed the colour away. Varna is a popular tourist destination as it is the largest city and seaside resort on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast. The cat certainly drew attention in Varna, but could it be that someone has kidnapped the animal? Another theory is that the rain has simply washed off the paint, or it has been given a good clean . The cat has been reported missing after not being seen for two to three days in Varna, Bulgaria . It is hoped that the stand-out nature of the feline won't influence owners to paint their own cats. The RSPCA has warned that dyeing or painting animals for cosmetic reasons could have 'potentially fatal consequences'. Some locals were quoted as saying they believe the stray cat was becoming greener each day, fuelling the idea that someone was painting it. A video appeared on YouTube which shows the feline playing with a ginger cat, whose marmalade-coloured coat stands in stark contrast to the bright-green fur.","Green cat has been drawing attention in streets of Varna, Bulgaria .

"A second British national from Coventry has been reportedly killed fighting for Islamic State. Rashid Amani, 19, had been fighting for Islamic State in the besieged Syrian town of Kobane when he suffered serious wounds from a US air strike. Amani travelled with his fellow school friends, Mohammed Hadi and Ali Kalantar from his home in Coventry to Syria in March of this year. Kalantar, 18, was reportedly killed by a French air strike during an ISIS offensive on Tikrit University in Iraq. Hadi, also known as Abu Yahya al-Kurdi, is the only one of the Coventry trio is still alive. Scroll down for video .

Abu Musab al-Jazairi, who appears to have been a close friend of the two deceased Coventry boys, posted a photo of Rashid Amani and declared him to be a martyr. Amani, known by his nom de guerre 'Abu Massoud al-Khurassani' or 'Abu Bakr al-Khurassani, 'appears smiling in the photo, wearing camouflage military fatigues with his index finger raised. Abu Musab also posted a photo of the final clothes wore by Kalantar before he went to his death. The caption reads, 'My brother Ali al-Farsi's last outfit he wore before going to Iraq and getting his shahada [martyrdom]. Al-hamdullilah [praise be to God], passed on to me.' Rashid Amani left his home in Coventry in March this year alongside two friends, Mohammed Hadi (right) and Ali Kalantar (left) Amani grew up in Coventry and attended Coventry's Barr Hill's School and Community College with Ali Kalantar. The pair were both of Afghan origin. It is unclear whether Hadi attended the same school but he was said to be good friends with the two teenagers. Hadi, who is of Kurdish descent and speaks fluent Arabic, Kurdish and moderate Somali, chose to leave his two friends and fight separately in Iraq after joining the Islamic State. Prior to leaving for Syria, Amani had been studying Business at Coventry University. Kalantar had been taking his A Levels and also planned to study at Coventry University, hoping to study Computer Science. Amani's father, Khabir, revealed in a BBC interview, that family members had actively tried to bring him back from Syria.

"An Indianapolis grandmother stood up to a bunch of teenage would-be car thieves by refusing to give them the keys to her minivan. Kay Kise, 67, had just arrived home and was just getting out of her car when three black males approached her. One of the teens asked her for directions and then pulled a gun on her. Scroll down for video... One tough lady: Kay Kise,  a 67-year-old grandmother is recovering from serious facial injures after she says she refused to give in to three young men who tried to steal her van on Sunday night . Blatent: She had been doing some Christmas shopping and was just getting out of her van when three males, about 16 years old, approached her asking for directions - after which he pulled a gun on her . While gathering her belongings, a teenager approached Mrs Kise outside her van. 'He come up to my car and he said, 'Do you know where Hendricks Place is?'' said Mrs Kise. 'I told him it was just two blocks over and continued grabbing my shopping bags. The next thing you know, I turned back around and he had this gun right in my face,' she told WTHR. Mrs Kise now believes the question was simply a distraction as two other men were walking down the street at the same time as the assault. 'You are not getting the keys to my car.' she recalled. 'I shook that gun out of my face and I said, 'You are not taking my car. I haven't had it that long and you're not getting it.' The attack happened around 7pm on Sunday night. Badly hurt: The teen suspect bashed Kise in the side of her head, knocking her dizzy. She fell into her van with the sliding back door still open. The next thing she knew, she was sitting in the back seat . Survivor: She's not sure how many times she was hit, but she has several facial fractures, bleeding on her brain and her left eye is swollen shut . After being approached by the teens there was a brief struggle when Mrs Kise was hit several times over her head. The next moment, the teen suspect bashed her in the side of her head, knocking her back into her van. One of the assailants brought out a silver gun, shoved it in her face, demanded the keys to her van and pistol whipped her. The next thing she knew, she was sitting in the back seat. Her head was throbbing and starting to bleed and swell, but, she was still holding her keys. The bruises appear to be quite severe but fortunately she does not remember getting hit. A next door neighbor heard Mrs Kay's screams and called 911 but by the time officers arrived the three would-be thieves were long gone. Paramedics were called and Mrs Kise was taken to hospital so that doctors could treat her eye and face injuries. On the lookout: Mrs Kise hopes the thieves will be caught. She doesn't regret her decision to say 'no' to the would-be carjackers. She's not sure how many times she was hit, but she has several facial fractures, bleeding on her brain and her left eye is swollen shut.

'And I don't have no money to buy another one with. So they weren't going to take it from me.' 'I wasn't about to let no young punk take my car,' Mrs Kise said. Looking back, she cannot understand what motivated the attack against her. 'I don't hurt nobody,' she said. 'I don't understand why the children would hurt me.'

"Death: Bernadine 'Bernie' Ingram, 57, had been on board a yacht when it was hit by a 5,000-ton dredger . A wife was killed on a yacht in a freak accident on a summer’s day, it was revealed today. Bernadine 'Bernie' Ingram, 57, had been on board her yacht Orca  with her husband Peter when it was hit by the 5,000-ton dredger Shoreway in the North Sea off the Suffolk coast. Mrs Ingram had been wearing a life jacket as she sunbathed on deck when her 29ft craft was hit by the 321ft ship in clear conditions. A huge wave sparked by the crash which slammed her into the galley, trapping her as the boat quickly sank about six miles off Felixstowe. Today, Dutch seaman Gerardus Chapel, from Papendrecht in the western Netherlands, admitted failing to discharge his duties properly as the officer of the watch on the dredger. Mark Watson, prosecuting, said the incident happened at about 1.30pm on June 8. He told Ipswich Magistrates’ Court that Chapel was in charge of the Shoreway’s course when it collided with the Orca, with the Ingrams and their two Border Collie dogs aboard. The yacht was holed in the hull and sank immediately. The Cypriot-registered dredger had been on its way out to sea at the time. Mr Watson told the court: ‘There came a stage where it changed course slightly from the deep water channel and proceeded south into an area which is known to be frequented by sailing yachts, especially at the weekend.’ The Ingrams, who had set sail from Levington, near Ipswich, were returning home after going out to sea on a sunny day. Mr Ingram was at the helm and saw the Shoreway in the distance, the court heard. It appeared to be in the deep water channel. Sailing: The Ingrams were returning home on the yacht Orca (above) after going out to sea on a sunny day . Shoreway: The Cypriot-registered dredger (file picture, above) had been on its way out to sea at the time . Mr Ingram, of Butley, Suffolk, was not heading towards the channel but was sailing parallel to it. He ducked below deck to go the toilet for no longer than a couple of minutes leaving his wife on deck at the back of the yacht. Dutch seaman: Gerardus Chapel admitted failing to discharge his duties properly at a magistrates' court . Mr Ingram, who is a Labour party advisor and former chief technology officer of telecoms regulator Ofcom, went back up to find the huge dredger just feet away from his craft. The ship then hammered into his yacht, striking the starboard anchor of the Shoreway. Mr Watson said: ‘The Orca was hulled pretty much amidships and began to take on water.’ Shell-shocked Mr Ingram was trapped in the cabin as it quickly filled with water. He was only able to escape after a desperate struggle to save his life, the court heard. Mr Ingram assumed his wife Bernie had been swept into the sea as she was on deck. But an enormous surge of water had dragged the doctor’s receptionist into the galley and she drowned as the yacht plunged below the waves. The terrifying accident triggered a full-scale sea search backed up by a rescue team from Felixstowe, two lifeboats from Harwich, one from Walton-on-the-Naze and two harbour boats from Harwich. Mrs Ingram’s body was recovered from her wrecked boat the next day while one of her beloved pet dogs also died in the incident. Ian Lawrie, QC, defending Chapel, said the case centred on an ‘omission to do something’ and came down to ‘human frailty’. The case was committed to Ipswich Crown Court for sentencing on a future date and the experienced seaman was freed on unconditional bail. Labour advisor: Mrs Ingram's husband Peter is a former chief technology officer of telecoms regulator Ofcom. He was only able to escape from the yacht after a desperate struggle to save his life, the court heard . A Maritime and Coastguard Agency spokesman said: ‘The sentencing range for this type of offence is anything from unconditional discharge, to an unlimited fine to two years imprisonment.’ Much-loved Mrs Ingram had worked as a doctors’ receptionist at the Peninsula Practice in Orford, Suffolk, for 14 years. She set up and ran a special support group for patients battling cancer. Her devastated colleagues saluted the ‘love, kindness and care’ Mrs Ingram gave patients and colleagues as they paid tribute to her at her funeral. Councillor Mark Bee, leader of Suffolk County Council, said at the time: ‘We’re most saddened by her tragic death. We’ve been in contact with Peter to offer our full support at this most difficult time.’","Bernadine Ingram, 57, had been on board yacht Orca with her husband .

"Around one pedestrian in seven injured on the roads is drunk at the time, according to research. It also reveals the run-up to Christmas is a peak period for accidents involving ‘drunk walkers’. Some 14 per cent of those involved in a road accident while on foot over the past three years were ‘walking under the influence’ of alcohol after a night on the tiles, it says. New research suggests around one pedestrian in seven injured during accidents on the roads is drunk . Figures from the Department of Transport reveal more than 6,000 intoxicated pedestrians have been injured since 2011. They are also posing a problem for thousands of innocent motorists as their unpredictable and often dangerous behaviour – from drunkenly crossing roads without looking or simply staggering onto a road and into the path of an oncoming car - increases the risk of a crash. Nearly a third of drivers say they have had to swerve or brake in order to avoid hitting a drunk pedestrian, with one in eight admitting to hitting one. The AA said some drunk pedestrians have been killed lying unseen in the gutter when street lights have been switched off to cut osts. The report based on Freedom of Information data from 21 police forces and statistics from the Transport Department reveals that men account for more than three quarters, or 79 per cent, of all drunk pedestrian road incidents, with those under the age of 25 involved in more incidents than any other age group. Figures from the Department of Transport reveal more than 6,000 intoxicated pedestrians have been injured since 2011 . Drunk pedestrians are more at risk of injury on UK roads at night between the times of 10pm and midnight - close to pub and bar closing times and ‘perhaps as a result of a long night of drinking,’ says the dossier. A report by insurers Confused.com says: ‘Over 6,000 ‘drunk’ pedestrians have been injured on UK roads since 2011 - and many of these ‘drunk walking’ accidents are happening over the Christmas period.’ It says nearly a third of all drunken pedestrian incidents involved people between the ages of 18 to 24 and says this suggests ‘that the young are not taking enough care on the roads after consuming alcohol’. Separate research found that 83 per cent of people admit having walked home while under the influence of alcohol, with just over one in five, or 21 per cent, admitting they consumed eight drinks or more on a night out. A third of drunk pedestrians  admitted to having walked down roads which were unlit; with nearly two thirds, 62 per cent, confessing that they have walked home alone when under the influence of alcohol, according to findings from 2,000 people questioned by One Poll Research. One in seven admitted to crossing roads without looking properly while drunk and a similar proportion said they have sat down on the side of the road when intoxicated. A worrying one in 10 confessed to having fallen into a road when drunk. Drunken walkers are also putting motorists at risk, with nearly a third of drivers saying they had to swerve or brake in order to avoid hitting a pedestrian they suspected of being intoxicated. About one in eight admitted to having actually knocked into a pedestrian that they believed to be drunk. Figures show the run-up to Christmas is a peak period for accidents involving ‘drunk walkers’ However more than a fifth of motorists say they would either stop their car or call the police if they saw a drunken person staggering in the road. Across the country last year the Metropolitan Police recorded 158 ‘drunk walk’ injuries, Kent police recorded 123 injuries, Glasgow City Council: 126 injuries, and Northern Ireland 64. Scotland has this month lowered the legal drink-drive limit from 80mgs – where it remains in the rest of the UK - to 50mgs per 100ml of blood. AA spokesman Paul Watters said: ’Sadly these statistics do not surprise us. We have had reports of pedestrians lying in the gutter and being killed because coroners said drivers did not see them. Cut backs on street lights play a part. ‘Sometimes drunks use main roads and even motorways to walk home because it’s the way they now from driving. Then they tumble into the road and there’s a tragedy.’ Gemma Stanbury, head of motor Insurance at Confused.com, said: ’There is already much being done to raise awareness around the dangers of drink driving, but it is the responsibility of all road users – both motorists and pedestrians - to act responsibly when near or on the roads. 'Nobody wants to see anyone involved in a road accident, especially over the Christmas period. 'However the reality is that more people are out consuming alcohol over the festive season, leading to an unfortunate increase in the number of pedestrian casualties.' Breath test data shows that in 2013, 3 per cent of drivers and riders failed a breath test following a reported personal injury accident. Drink drive casualty estimates for 2012 show that there were 230 drink drive deaths in 2012. There were 1,430 drink drive killed or seriously injured casualties (KSIs) in 2012. In that same year about 6 per cent of killed motorcyclists and around a quarter of vehicle drivers were found to be over the legal alcohol limit when they died.","New research shows one pedestrian in seven injured on roads is drunk .

"A 71-year-old woman who left home to get help for her injured husband has been found dead. Patricia and Stewart Little from Irasburg, Vermont, returned from a shopping trip on Monday at 5:30pm when Stewart fell getting out of the car and was unable to stand. His wife left their Creek Road driveway on foot in near freezing temperatures  to get assistance and three days later a police K-9 dog located her body in a field nearby. Scene of the incident: Patricia Little left her Creek Road driveway on foot in near freezing temperatures on Monday to get assistance for her husband who fell getting out of the car . Authorities were only alerted to the incident that day, after a family member dropped in on the Littles. Stewart had apparently managed to crawl into his home but couldn't reach the phone to call 911. He remained there, hoping for his wife to return. The relative said he was suffering from an undisclosed medical condition. After troopers and a canine unit arrived, Patricia was found in a patch of land between her home and the neighbors' shortly after 6pm on Wednesday. Police said there's no sign of foul play and a cause of death is pending. 'We suspect, obviously with the weather, that she may have fallen and was unable to get up, and she succumbed to the weather,' State Police Capt. J.P. Sinclair told WCAX-TV. 'It's obviously tragic - very, very sad. We certainly wish it could've ended differently,' he added. Stewart was taken to a hospital and is expected to recover.","Patricia and Stewart Little from Irasburg, Vermont, returned from a shopping trip on Monday afternoon when Stewart fell getting out of the car .

"Russia has joined the growing chorus of condemnation of the CIA torture programme, describing it as a shocking example of 'flagrant and systemic rights abuse'. In attacking the methods the CIA used when interrogating prisoners following the September 11 attacks, Russia has joined a number of other traditional U.S. enemies to criticise it for what they say are human rights violations. Russia's human rights commissioner, Konstantin Dolgov, said this week's U.S. Senate torture report revealed 'gross systemic rights violations' and jarred with U.S. aspirations to be regarded as a model of democracy. Russia's human rights commissioner, Konstantin Dolgov (pictured), said the torture methods jarred with U.S. aspirations to be regarded as a model of democracy . Russia has joined a number of other traditional enemies of the U.S., including China, Iran and North Korea, in condemning the CIA's torture methods. Pictured are prisoners at Guantanamo Bay . The report found that the CIA misled the White House and public about its torture of detainees at secret prisons around the world after 9/11, and acted more brutally and pervasively than it had acknowledged. 'Despite the fact that this inquisitorial torture was used by CIA agents outside U.S. territory, this does not remove their responsibility for these deliberate actions,' Dolgov said. 'We urge the human rights community, the appropriate international organisations and institutions to pressure Washington to disclose the information on rights violations in full... and hold the guilty responsible.' He pointed out that only an executive summary was released and urged international organizations and rights groups to push for the release of the full report and the prosecution of those involved in abuses. Moscow and Washington often spar about each other's human rights records, with Russia saying that the U.S. turns a blind eye to its own abuses while lecturing the rest of the world. The Ukraine crisis has brought relations between the two countries to their lowest point since the Cold War. Russia joins countries like Iran, North Korea and China, all frequent targets of human rights criticism from Washington, to use this week's report as an opportunity to turn the tables on the U.S. Yesterday Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei labelled the U.S. as a 'symbol of tyranny against humanity', while China urged the country to 'correct its ways' and begin following international conventions. The torture of Al-Qaeda suspects shows that the US government is a 'symbol of tyranny against humanity,' Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (pictured centre), has said . China called on America to 'reflect on this, correct its ways and earnestly respect and follow the rules of related international conventions'. Above, a detainee is escorted to interrogation at Guantanamo Bay . Chained and kneeling: Al Qaeda and Taliban detainees captured in Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks were transferred to the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba . In a sign of the damage inflicted by the revelations, even North Korea - whose own human rights record is appalling - described the methods as 'inhumane' and urged the UN Security Council to address the 'rampant human rights abuses' in the U.S. However, criticism has not been limited to U.S. foes - today Turkey and Slovakia, both key NATO allies, also condemned the report. Slovakian Minister of Foreign Affairs Miroslav Lajcak (pictured) hoped the report would serve as a 'guarantee' the torture would never be repeated . Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, whose country is in a strategically critical location between Europe and the Mideast, told reporters in Ankara the report is being analyzed to determine whether any Turkish citizens were involved. From what has already been read, however 'we see that there was inhumane and really unacceptable torture and treatment,' he said. Cavusoglu praised the release of the report, saying 'transparency is important,' but, he added 'this doesn't legitimize the torture that was inflicted.' 'I hope our friend and ally, the United States, won't repeat these kinds of actions, that inhumane acts are not repeated,' he said. Speaking alongside Cavusoglu, Slovakian Foreign Minister Miroslav Lajcak said the use of illegal camps and 'unacceptable methods of interrogation' detailed in the report had been known, but he welcomed the report's publication. 'I see it as a sign of the United States distancing themselves from these practices of the past,' he said. 'And it should also serve as a guarantee that things like that will never happen in the future.' The Senate intelligence committee's 500-page report concluded that the CIA inflicted suffering on al-Qaida prisoners beyond its legal authority and that none of the agency's 'enhanced interrogations' provided critical, life-saving intelligence. Meanwhile, a number of former CIA officials have hit back at the report's findings, saying it was partisan, one-sided and biased. Former vice president Dick Cheney branded it a 'terrible piece of work' and claimed President George W Bush was fully informed of the programme, and even authorised it. Former Vice President Dick Cheney (pictured) branded the Senate report a 'terrible piece of work' Furthermore, the CIA never tortured anyone under the legal definition of the word, as asserted by Department of Justice lawyers at the time, he said. The explosive report could yet open the floodgates for a wave of costly lawsuits for those countries complicit with the programme. Experts who have spent years working at American detention centres said yesterday's report did not contain any surprises, but suggested that now detainees' torture allegations are supported by an official government report, claimants have far more evidence to back any legal action.","Russian foreign minister describes CIA abuse as 'flagrant' and 'systemic'

"The New York borough of Queens has been given top spot in a list of the best places to visit in the US next year. The sprawling suburb, traditionally off the tourist map, has beaten a host of America's most famous destinations in an annual 'Best in the US' ranking compiled by Lonely Planet. The list praised Queens' microbreweries, beaches, global food offerings and ‘world-class’ art scene. The overlooked New York borough of Queens has been named the best place in the US to visit in 2015 . Lonely Planet praised the culinary scene that has sprung up around Rockaway Beach in Queens . As well as edging out its neighbouring and fashionable neighbour Brooklyn, Queens also triumphed over runners-up including western South Dakota, New Orleans, and North Conway and New Hampshire. ‘Nowhere is the image of New York as the global melting pot truer than Queens,’ said Lonely Planet in its best-of list. It added: ‘Browse New York’s biggest Chinatown in Flushing, shop for brilliantly coloured saris in Jackson Heights, and inhale the heady aromas of coffee and hookahs in Astoria.’ The list praised Queens' microbreweries, beaches, global food offerings and ‘world-class’ art scene . Queens has been described as a cultural 'melting pot' with more than 135 languages spoken in the area . ‘The incomparable array of world cuisines makes Queens a destination for food lovers from all parts of New York City. ‘For your art fix, ogle the new upgrades to the Queens Museum and the Museum of the Moving Image, look for the new Emerging Artists Festival in Long Island City, and stroll Astoria’s new 24-block arts district. ‘If you prefer sand and surf to paint and canvas, head to Rockaway. Don’t miss the prime eating and drinking scene that has popped up around the boardwalk - this is no cruddy carnival food: think succulent fish tacos, wood-fired pizzas, and wine bars.’ Borough President Melinda Katz has made tourism a priority of her administration since she took office last year, launching a marketing plan aimed at increasing visitation. ‘Queens is hot and on the move, and we’re thrilled by the growing attention and interest that the rest of the world has in its borough,’ Ms Katz said in a statement on the borough's website. Queens triumphed over popular US destinations including New Orleans, Louisiana, which came in third place . The Colorado River was another US tourist destination that lost out to Queens in the Lonely Planet's list . North Conway in New Hampshire came in fifth place in the Lonely Planet's 2015 Best in the US list . 1. Queens, New York . 2. Western South Dakota . 3. New Orleans, Louisiana . 4. Colorado River region . 5. North Conway, New Hampshire . 6. Indianapolis, Indiana . 7. Greenville, South Carolina . 8. Oakland, California . 9. Duluth, Minnesota . 10. Mount Shasta region, California . ‘This is a top destination of choice for people from around the globe to live, work and play. Our neighbourhoods are home to families that hail from over 120 countries and speak over 135 languages, so our diversity is a natural and tremendous asset to the international capital of the world. ‘You haven’t really seen New York City unless you have experienced Queens.’ Queens residents also highlighted the benefits of their own neighbourhood. ‘I think if you want a more immersive local experience when you visit New York City, then coming to Queens would give that to you,’ Sylvia Frys, a student at Hunter College who lives in Astoria, told CNBC. ‘Everyone else who comes to New York would just be getting the generic, touristy experience.’ Regis St. Louis, who contributes to Lonely Planet's USA guidebooks, said Queens was a diamond in the rough with its famous attractions and now word-of-mouth has made it more popular. ‘Increasingly, people are looking for more personal experiences and you can find them in Queens. You get a local flavour that is lacking in a more touristy part of Manhattan,’ he said. Western South Dakota came in second on Lonely Planet’s list. New York City saw more than 54 million tourists last year, with many heading to the trendy borough of Brooklyn . The other destinations in the top 10 were, in order, New Orleans, the Colorado River region, North Conway, Indianapolis, Greenville, Oakland, Duluth, and the Mount Shasta Region. New York City saw more than 54 million tourists in 2013, according to NYC & Company. But not everyone in New York is so sure that Queens deserved the top spot, with some suggesting that the fashionable area of Brooklyn, which won top spot in the Lonely Planet’s 2007 list, still had the edge over its neighbouring borough. Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Carlo Scissura told CNBC: ‘It was nice to see that our next door neighbour got a little love, but I think we all know there is still no place like Brooklyn. We're still the coolest, hottest place in the world.’","Once off the tourist map, Queens topped Lonely Planet's 'best of' list .

"Reg Winsor pictured with the tools he uses to fix potholes so effectively his local council has offered him a job . Tired of pleading with the council to repair potholes blighting his village, Reg Winsor took matters into his own hands. The retired builder, 72, picked up his tools once more, and took just 15 minutes to fix a notorious hole – known locally as ‘the crater’. Officials at Devon County Council were so impressed with his work they approached him about tackling other potholes in the area. He has now assembled a group of 50 volunteers, dubbed ‘Reg’s army’, to carry out the repairs. Mr Winsor said he was forced to take drastic action after the council repeatedly ignored his complaints about potholes near his home in Ilsington, Dartmoor. The local authority has an estimated repair backlog costing £758million for its 8,000 miles of town and country roads. The day after Mr Winsor fixed ‘the crater’, he was approached by two officers from the highways department, who suggested he train to become a volunteer ‘road warden’. He said: ‘I’d been complaining about this pothole for months and even though I was going through the right means, nothing was done. ‘It’s simple really – they haven’t got the money to do it, so I just decided to do it myself. ‘The Tarmac was given to me by local labourers and the rest I had.’ While Mr Winsor maintained that it is the council’s responsibility to fix the roads, he said residents should be more willing to help. ‘Mr Average is more than happy to sit there moaning about it but doesn’t do anything,’ he said. ‘I know we pay council taxes for repairs like this, but at the end of the day we may as well just fix them now. ‘We need to do it as a team, together everyone achieves more.’ Scroll down for video . Mr Winsor, a parish councillor, said his team would compile a list of potholes in the area and work to fix them as soon as possible. But predictably, they could find themselves hindered by bureaucracy. The local authority said Mr Winsor will be liable for any issues arising from his repairs until he undertakes formal training. Mr Winsor fills the pothole with asphalt and then uses an iron bar to compact it (pictured) The pothole Mr Winsor fixed (pictured after it was filled) was such a nuisance it was nicknamed 'the crater' His team will also only be allowed to fix minor defects that the council does not deem urgent enough to repair immediately. The cost of repairing Britain’s potholes stands at £12billion, according to a recent report. Around £32million a year is paid out in compensation for injuries and damage to cars caused by poorly maintained roads. Councillor Stuart Hughes, Devon’s cabinet member for highways, said: ‘Devon County Council is looking to respond positively to offers of help from local members of the community like Reg.’ Parking charges and fines made councils in England a record £667million last year. The surplus was up 12 per cent on the previous year, and the fifth annual rise in a row, according to figures from the RAC Foundation. Its director, Professor Stephen Glaister, said: ‘Over the same period, spending on local roads has fallen about a fifth in real terms.’ Communities Secretary Eric Pickles accused councils of ‘daylight robbery’ by ‘ripping off drivers with exorbitant parking charges and unfair fines’. Westminster had the biggest surplus in 2013/14, with £51million.","Reg Winsor grew tired waiting for pothole, called 'the crater', to be fixed .

"A maths graduate who murdered his father before dismembering him and placing his body parts in plastic storage boxes to use as a television stand was jailed for life today. Nathan Robinson, 27, was told he would serve a minimum of 30 years for killing his 48-year-old father William Spiller at the flat they shared in Bournemouth, Dorset in May 2013. Robinson had carefully cut up his father's corpse with a Stanley knife, a hacksaw and a saw,before placing the parts in boxes in the victim's bedroom with a television placed on top. His head was was placed in a box and put in a filing cabinet. Jailed: Nathan Robinson, 27, (left) will serve a minimum of 30 years for killing his 48-year-old father William Spiller (right) at the flat they shared in Bournemouth, Dorset in May 2013 and cutting up his body . The University of Aberystwyth graduate had stolen his father's phone and thousands of pounds in cash before travelling to Glasgow, Birmingham and Bristol to visit friends and relatives the day after the murder, police said. While he was in Scotland he gave one of his friends a boxset of the Saw horror films, Winchester Crown Court was told. Robinson had denied murder but admitted manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility, but last month it took the jury just 90 minutes to find him guilty of murder. The court heard how Robinson killed his father for ‘financial gain’ and wanted to ‘help himself’ to £10,000 of his father’s money. Robinson claimed that he only had limited memories of the killing and that he had been abused as a child by his father and by another man on a separate occasion, the trial heard. He also said his mother, Elaine Robinson, worked as a prostitute and he had found an advertisement which she used to offer her services. But Nigel Lickley QC, prosecuting, said Robinson murdered Mr Spiller over 'money disputes' and owed him a figure in the region of £36,000. He said: 'The defendant was convicted of his father’s murder. Caught on camera: CCTV shows  Nathan Robinson at Bournemouth railway station on the day after he murdered his father and put his dismembered body into storage boxes he was using as a TV stand . 'Police attended the flat and noted strong smells and flies, alive and dead, in the hallway leading up to the property. 'They entered and found Mr Spiller within the bedroom area, his body had been dismembered deliberately and carefully and placed in plastic storage boxes together with items of clothing. 'Mr Spiller’s head had been removed, cut off, and was found within another box within a filing cabinet in the bedroom. 'There was a significant degree of planning and premeditation as he dismembered the body. 'He used different tools including a small saw for different parts of the body and he used the heavier saw for other parts of the body including the spine. 'He then lied to cover his tracks and when he talked to his neighbour David Kiff he said his father was going away with his girlfriend.' Before leaving the flat, Robinson set about cleaning up his crime scene. He went out and bought a floor and steam cleaner from Homebase but ended up flooding the bathroom and pink droplets began to soak the walls of the flat below belonging to neighbour Mr Kiff, 67, the court heard. Journey: The day after the killing, Robinson travelled from Bournemouth to Glasgow for a weekend with friends, taking with him a box set of the Saw films . In the following month, he then covered his tracks by using his father’s mobile phone, sending text messages posing as the 6ft 4in, 25-stone Mr Spiller. The jury also heard that Robinson and his father had a history of disputes and that on the day of the murder, their downstairs neighbours had heard arguing, the sounds of a struggle and Mr Spiller asking his son to get him an ambulance. Robinson, now of Kingswinford, West Midlands, was arrested on June 18 last year - a day after Mr Spiller’s girlfriend Glenys Molyneux reported her taxi driver partner was missing to police. After his arrest at his mother's home in Birmingham he told police 'Is this a joke?' Giving evidence during the trial, Robinson said he headed for Glasgow with the Saw boxset because 'he wanted to get rid of them'. The films, which ran in cinemas from 2004 until 2010, are the fifth-highest earning horror franchise of all time. Struggling to recall in specific detail what he had done, Robinson said: 'I had an image of attacking him with a Stanley knife. 'I can remember a great deal of anger and also being scared at one point. It was the most angry I have ever been. 'I remember being in the shower and I was washing blood off me and whilst I’m showering I’m calling my dad a dirty c-*-*-*.' By the time police discovered Mr Spiller's body it was so decomposed that he had to be identified by dental records. Michael Vere-Hodge QC, defending, said this was a ‘rare’ case and the fatal incident was a ‘very sudden event’. He told the court: 'It is very rare for someone to kill their own father. 'We suggest the facts of the case point to a very sudden event where there was a complete lack of self control for whatever reason. 'This particular case falls into a very unusual category as there appears to be no attempt to dispose of the body parts. 'He is a very socially active and is a high achiever from perhaps not the most promising background. Sentencing: Judge Mr Justice Griffith Williams told Winchester Crown Court that the murder as an 'act of wickedness' and said Robinson was a 'deceitful' and 'manipulative young man' 'This was a matter in a domestic setting where the pair were sharing the accommodation and there was sudden explosion of violence. 'We argue there was no motive whatsoever.' Judge Mr Justice Griffith Williams described the murder as an ‘act of wickedness’ and said Robinson was a ‘deceitful’ and ‘manipulative young man’. He said: 'I have no doubt you are a thoroughly deceitful, scheming and manipulative young man. 'I have no doubt you planned to kill your father and planned an elaborate cover up. 'The prosecution case, which I accept, is that the explanation for your decision to kill your father was a quarrel about the money you owed him. 'There was evidence of an IOU for £36,000 dated June 5, 2011. 'The absence of defence injuries proves you must have very quickly overpowered him and disabled him - more likely by cutting his throat. 'You then cut him elsewhere on his head and about his body ignoring his pleas for an ambulance and the help which would have saved his life. 'As you acknowledged when cross-examined, you watched him die.' Robinson was found guilty of murder after a jury of five women and seven men took just 90 minutes to reach a verdict. Mr Justice Williams told Robinson that he had 'shown no remorse whatsoever'. He continued: 'This was a cold-blooded murder but I cannot be sure the killing involved sadistic conduct. 'What then followed was a very carefully thought out and executed cover-up. 'After spending the night in the flat you left for Glasgow, taking some £10,000 of your father’s money with you. 'In Glasgow, and later in the Midlands and elsewhere, you spent his money and behaved as if nothing had happened. 'You have shown no remorse whatsoever. 'I am satisfied the seriousness of your offending was particularly high and that your motive was financial gain. 'By killing him, you could help yourself to the large amount of cash he kept in the flat. 'Indeed, as I observed earlier, this was a cold blooded, premeditated killing. 'A conclusion is that this was an act of wickedness. 'Balancing the limited mitigation with the aggravating factors I have identified, I sentence you to Life Imprisonment with a minimum term of 30 years.' Following today’s sentencing, Ms Molyneaux said the past 18 months had been 'extremely traumatic from first receiving the dreadful news of Will’s death until the trial which revealed the full horror of what happened that day'. She continued: 'Will was a loving, caring man with a hilarious sense of fun and humour. 'No sentence can bring him back but we are satisfied that the verdict of guilty was the appropriate one for this heinous crime. 'As a family we would like to thank people for their love and support during this dreadful time.' Dorset Police said Robinson had gone to 'great lengths' to try and mislead officers and Ms Molyneaux. Senior investigating officer Detective Chief Inspector John Gately, said: 'This was a particularly gruesome murder. 'What is clear from the evidence is that Nathan Robinson went to great lengths to try and mislead the police and the victim’s partner. 'My thoughts go out to Mr Spiller’s family and friends. 'I would like to pay tribute to the investigation team, in particular the case officer Dave Richards and the forensic team who had to deal with a horrific crime scene.'","Nathan Robinson, 27, to serve minimum of 30 years for killing his father .

"How much do you hate your daily commute? Probably quite a lot if you live in the UK. New research from Samsung has looked into how much time Europeans spend travelling to and from work, what annoys us most during our commute, and which nations spend the longest in transit. The study found that the UK enjoys the fastest commute, with the average person's journey to work taking 36 minutes and 53 seconds, which amounts to six days commuting to and from work a year (or 144 hours). The study found that 64 per cent of Europeans listen to music during their commute, 15 per cent do nothing and 21 per cent people watch . In fact, nearly one in three  British commuters (28 per cent) have a journey of under 20 minutes, a stark contrast to the European average of just under 45 minutes. It's also much less than  those in Belgium, who clock the longest daily commute at 52 minutes and 48 seconds. You'd think we'd be happy about that but the survey says that 87 per cent of Brits admit getting frustrated on their way to work, with traffic jams, slow drivers and loud talkers topping the list of annoyances.

"Planning a last minute festive flight home this Christmas to see the family? You may want to avoid Luton or Stansted airports. According to new figures, passengers flying from London  are most likely to suffer fight delays than anywhere else in the UK on the run up to Christmas. Travel website flightcompensation.com has revealed a list of the worst offending airports for tardiness based on flight data from December 2013, with Luton and Stansted facing the most disruption a year ago. A website has compiled a list of the worst UK airports  for delays based on data from December 2013 . Luton came out top as the worst airport for delays over 15 minutes, followed by Stansted and Gatwick . Luton Airport was named the worst airport for Christmas flight delays  with the majority (56.61 per cent) of all flights that month being delayed by 15 minutes or more. Not faring much better, Stansted came a close second with 54.9 per cent, followed by Gatwick with 54.27 per cent and Heathrow came at ninth with 31.84 per cent. Manchester (42.28 per cent), Southampton (39.29 per cent) and Bournemouth (38.64 per cent) were also included in the top ten along with private airfield Northolt (50 per cent), Prestwick (35.44 per cent) and Nottingham East Midlands (31.84 per cent). A plane takes off at Luton airport where, in December last year, 56.61 per cent of flights took off late . However, Northolt's place on the list is misleading as it had only two flights during all of December 2013, and one of the two was delayed. Prestwick had 73  delayed flights over 15 minutes and Nottingham East Midlands had 306. Flightcompensation.com has also revealed the the best airports to travel from if you don't want to be late. Southend, Cambridge, City of Derry and Isles of Scilly were the best airports for on-time departures. No flights from any of those four airports took off with delays longer than 15 minutes during December.

The study also showed which airports had the largest number of delays over three hours long in December - the point at which flights are potentially eligible for flight delay compensation according to EU rules. Glasgow came out worst (1.33 per cent) and London Gatwick was second with 1.32 per cent of flights delayed over three hours. Gatwick also won the 'wooden spoon' award for longest delay: 25 hours and nine minutes on a British Airways flight to Larnaca, Cyprus. London Heathrow was third with 198 delays (1.02 per cent). Flight delay legal expert Kevin Clarke said: 'Christmas delays of three hours or more are particularly stressful because they often mean that passengers are missing out on precious time with their loved ones. 'Many of the passengers involved in the study don't realise that they could be entitled to compensation for delays. 'We sometimes hear that airlines have told them that they are not owed any money, despite having their festive plans disrupted or even ruined. 'But as we find time and time again passengers are not excluded from compensation just because airlines tell them that they are.'","Luton comes out worst, followed by Stansted then Gatwick for delays .

"For the past decade, a trip to the cinema using two-for-one cinema tickets on a Wednesday has become a regular habit for millions of Britons. But now, it’s curtains for Orange Wednesdays, as EE is closing the popular scheme in February 2015. When it launched, the offer may have proved an enticing incentive for cinema goers to pick Orange as their mobile network of choice. No more cheap dates! EE is ending Orange Wednesdays, which for the last decade, has given customers the opportunity to buy two-for-one cinema tickets every Wednesday - making date nights cheaper (stock image) But now other networks are offering rival incentives and less people are using Orange Wednesdays, perhaps streaming films to tablets and TVs instead, leading EE to cite 'changing viewing habits' as the reason for closing the scheme. ‘Orange Wednesday at its peak was a massive success and an iconic promotion,’ EE said. EE has promised that there will be a replacement . ‘Our brand has changed and our customers' viewing habits have also evolved so it's time to move on.’ The deal currently gets EE customers a cheap meal at the Pizza Express restaurant chain too. Many fans of the scheme feared that EE might roll the credits on Orange Wednesdays, when T-Mobile and Orange merged in 2010. However, EE has promised that there will be a replacement. ‘We're working on new customer entertainment rewards and we'll provide more details soon.’ If the offer doesn’t prove as compelling for customers, they may well swap to Vodafone or O2, which offer copycat schemes of Orange Wednesday. O2's Priority Moments gives customers special offers on Odeon cinema tickets, for example. If you're planning on axing mid-week cinema trips in the New Year, a £16 gadget lets you project films streamed to a smartphone onto any surface. Made from cardboard, the simple design also claims to amplify the sound without the need for additional wires or a separate sound system. The black and white Smart Phone Projector is listed on on PrezzyBox.com and can be set up 'within minutes,' according to its maker, Luckies of London. Cheap alternative to the cinema? The Smart Phone projector costs less than two trips to the cinema and claims to project films stored on, or streamed to smartphones, onto a chosen surface . It has a 10x magnifying lens at the front to increase the video size on a wall and a grip pad on the back to securely hold a smartphone in place. The portable gadget costs £15.95 ($27), and means you can turn any room in your home into a cinema screen. But there are a number compromises. For instance, the projection is dim, small, and can often be blurry. There are also no volume controls.","EE is closing popular 2-for-1 ticket scheme in February 2015 .

"To hear you have been badly behaved can be distressing enough for a child, but to hear it from Father Christmas himself is enough to upset anyone. That's what happened to Tyler, 8, and Freya, 4, after receiving a letter from 'Santa' telling them that they were on the naughty list - and might not be receiving any presents. Laura Cole, from Epsom in Surrey, devised the elaborate plan to encourage her  children to behave on the run up to Christmas. Laura, pictured with Tyler and Freya, who are behaving well after receiving the letter from 'Santa' The married mother-of-three wrote a letter posing as Santa Claus, addressed it to two of her children Tyler, Freya, but not Logan, who is only one, and filmed Tyler reading it out loud. In the footage, the young boy can be heard reading how Father Christmas had been 'watching' them for 'two weeks' and was 'certain' that both Tyler and Freya would be on his 'naughty list'. 'You have not been good children,' he writes and gives them '13 sleeps' to turn the situation around. Freya, 4, Tyler, 8, and Logan, 1 (left to right) during happier times sitting in front of a Christmas tree . 'If you do not start behaving you will not receive the lovely presents I have for you both,' he ends. Tyler and his younger sister Freya looked crushed in the video, as the boy's voice quivers as he reads out the letter. As he is reading, the little blonde-haired girl, dressed in a pink dressing gown, hugs her legs and looks upset, saying: 'We can't be on his naughty list!' He continues reading as the Freya cries in the background, rubbing her eyes. The offending letter was typed up by the children's mother and put in a stocking by the chimney . Dear Tyler and Freya, . I have been watching you for the last few weeks and I am certain that you will both be on my naughty list. You have not been good children. I can see you have been fighting with each other and not treating each other well. This has made me feel extremely disappointed. I am also not impressed with the lack of listening you do Freya and the attitude you have at the moment Tyler. You have 13 sleeps to change this. I will be watching you both very very closely in a hope I can change you to the nice list. If you do not start behaving you will not receive the lovely presents I have for you both. Remember only good children are on the nice list. I hope to see you on Christmas Eve. Santa Claus . At the end of the letter, Tyler and his sister look up at their mother, and the little boy throws the the piece of paper on the floor sobbing: 'What are you looking at us like that for - it makes me upset! The mother says: 'You have 13 days to improve.' To which Tyler says, indicating to his sister: 'I know, but she keeps annoying me! 'And I can't just stop her,' he adds, his face trembling and his arms crossed in front of him. 'We can work on this together,' the mother tells them, to which Freya says: 'I don't want to be on the naughty list.' Laura, who lives with her husband Dennis, 32, said in her defence: 'From the moment they wake up, to the moment they go to sleep they’re fighting with each other, arguing and annoying one another. 'I wrote the letter and put it in the stocking that is hanging on the chimney, Freya was so excited when she found it and came running in at quarter to six, ""mummy, mummy, a letter from Santa"". 'Tyler opened the letter and that’s when I started filming. It’s not that I didn’t think he would take it seriously, but I just thought he’d brush it off. Tyler Cole is heartbroken that he is on the naughty list and that Father Christmas might not bring him gifts . Upset: Tyler starts to cry and his little sister Freya wipes her eyes after hearing the news . 'When he started crying I felt like crying with him but I was just trying to focus on saying encouraging things about their behaviour. 'After reading the letter they were amazing, like angels, Tyler helped Freya get dressed and even held her hand on the way to school which was a big improvement. 'Usually you have to tell Freya 10 times to get dressed, but that morning I only had to ask her once. 'I do feel bad though, and when we got to school I went in to talk to the teacher to tell her what I’d done in case he got upset in class!' Laura, who works for Crystal Ski, said the letter has had the desired effect. 'He's always watching': Laura with Dennis and their three children Logan, Tyler and Freya visiting Santa . 'One day on and their behaviour has been amazing - completely different to before they received the letter,' she said. 'They normally fight like cat and dog from the minute they wake up, but this morning Tyler helped Freya get dressed and walk her to school. And after school they played nicely together - they even wrote their Christmas cards together. 'We have left the letter from Santa on the side so they can see it. 'If they start to argue, we point to it and say ""remember, he's always watching"". 'My husband wasn't there when Tyler read out the letter, but the next morning they came and told him about it. My husband told them that they need to buck their ideas up.'","Mother videos children reading letter from 'Santa' telling them to behave .

"The number of humpback whale sightings in New York has skyrocketed by more than 400per cent in two years, according to wildlife experts. Gotham Whale, which documents the marine mammal population around the city, revealed there were 87 spotted this year compared to 33 in 2013 and just 15 the year before. Conservation biologist Dr. Howard Rosenbaum suspects that a greater abundance of menhaden, one of the humpbacks' favorite foods, could have attracted them from farther out in the ocean. That might be because the water is cleaner. Growing population: In this June 2014 photo provided by Gotham Whale, a humpback whale breaks through the surface of the Atlantic Ocean just off a beach on the Rockaway peninsula near New York City . 'One would like to think that some of this has been triggered by an improved environmental ethic,' Rosenbaum said. 'We have the clean air and clean water acts, the Marine Mammal Protection Act and associated state laws. It's hard to make the link for sure but there's certainly been a behavioral change toward the natural environment.' Humpbacks - which can be reach 50 feet long and weigh 40 tons - were spotted 87 times from the boats this year, and by cataloging the whales' markings, at least 19 different humpbacks have been identified in the waters off the city. Paul Sieswerda, founder of Gotham Whale,  said reports of humpbacks in the New York Bight, where the city's harbor meets the Atlantic, began to pick up around 2010 from surprised fishermen and other veterans on the water. Caught on camera: Humpbacks have been approaching the city in greater numbers than in many years; there were 87 sightings in nearby waters from a whale-watching boat in 2014 . Dinner time: Conservation biologist Dr. Howard Rosenbaum suspects that a greater abundance of menhaden, one of the humpbacks' favorite foods, could have attracted them from farther out in the ocean . Gotham Whale then partnered with the American Princess whale-watching boat, providing naturalists who could document the sightings. The naturalists also do an educational presentation on the boat and answer customers' questions, said Tom Paladino, the boat's captain. 'It was pretty slim pickings at first, actually,' Sieswerda said. 'We went on many cruises and had three sightings totaling five whales in 2011.' Many whales were sighted more than once. But by comparing flukes - the distinctive shapes and markings of their tails - 19 different humpbacks have been documented near the city so far. Customers on the whale-watching tours are asked to share any photos they get of such markings for the New York City Humpback Whale Catalog. 'This is the way they've been doing it in Maine and Massachusetts, the recognized way to keep track of these whales, study their behavior,' Sieswerda said. Trend: Paul Sieswerda, founder of Gotham Whale, said reports of humpbacks in the New York Bight began to pick up around 2010 from surprised fishermen and other veterans on the water . Endangered: Counting whales is difficult, but the International Whaling Commission says its latest estimates put the worldwide population at about 150,000 . Sieswerda agreed that various factors are in play but, 'I think it all begins with cleaner water,' including the improved Hudson River. Whatever the cause, humpback populations worldwide are increasing. Counting whales is difficult, but the International Whaling Commission says its latest estimates put the worldwide population at about 150,000. About 11,600 of those are in the Western North Atlantic, which includes the New York Bight off New York City. There might have been just hundreds before whale protection laws were passed. New Yorkers shouldn't expect to see humpbacks frolicking around the Statue of Liberty. Except for the occasional disoriented calf, the whales generally stay well outside the harbor, beyond the 'gate' formed by the Rockaway peninsula in New York and Sandy Hook in New Jersey. Rosenbaum worries that more whales could mean problems in the busy shipping lanes out of New York. And he hopes they'll be taken into consideration when offshore wind-power projects are suggested. But he says, 'Having them here is truly remarkable and encouraging. I think it will help people in New York embrace the natural world and the marine environment and these iconic species.'","There were 87 sightings this year compared to  just 15 in 2012 .

"Intimate portraits of Namibia's Himba tribe and the rock churches of Lalibela in Ethiopia earned Kent-born Philip Lee Harvey the title of 2014's Travel Photographer of the Year from a field of entries that capture Earth both at its most majestic and brutal. While Harvey's subjects are hardly original, the award's judges admitted, they said the way the British photographer captured them in his two sets of four images was elegant, beautiful and striking. 'The two sets of images are shot in very different styles,' said a statement on behalf of the judges. 'The Lalibela portfolio uses the portrait format to show the depth of the rock-hewn churches and this is complimented by the photographer's angle of view in this difficult lighting. The portraits of the Himba woman are beautiful in their detail and limited colour palette, capturing the tribal shapes and patterns in strong compositions.' Two portraits from Namibia's Himba tribe that helped earn Philip Lee Harvey the overall Travel Photographer of the Year awards . This elegant image of two elderly women at a rock church in Lalibela, Ethiopia, was among Harvey's other set that caught the judges' eyes . Harvey's prize was the pinnacle of a host of honours, including the Young Travel Photographer of the Year which was awarded to 17-year-old Samuel Fisch from New York City's Bronx. Fisch's series of boldly coloured images of seemingly mundane objects where panoramic landscapes would be the more conventional choice on the Venetian island of Burano in Italy - he is the first person to win the title twice after he picked it up in 2012. 'He has elegantly captured the essence of the place whilst staying away from the obvious canals and boats to create a clean, cohesive portfolio,' the judges said. Australian Joshua Holko's winning image in the Wild and Vibrant category captures the incredible moment a polar bear looks up from consuming a recent seal kill, its bloodied face and the deep red-coloured seal carcass standing out vividly against the white fur and snow. Joshua Holko, from Melbourne, Australia, shot this magic moment of a polar bear just after it devoured a seal. The judges said: 'The elegance of the setting contrasts with the gruesome natural way of life in this harsh environment of Svalbard (between Norway and the North Pole)' The dramatic ice and water scene from Poland's Jakub Rybicki won Best Single Image in a Portfolio in the Earth, Air, Fire, Water category . Simplicity was key in the work of Marsel van Oosten, of the Netherlands, these eerie dead camelthorn trees in the Namib Desert . From pilgrims making perilous progress 14,000ft up in the Himalayas to cave divers exploring the cenotes of Mexico, from the bleak beauty of skeletal trees to  colourful bands of rock in Northumberland, and from bicycle adventures in Norway to the lives of honey-hunters in Bangladesh, thousands of entries from professional and amateur photographers from over 100 countries were judged by an international panel that included the UK's own award-winning photographers Eamonn McCabe and Chris Weston. Malaysian oral implantologist Nick Ng Yeow Kee won the Tribes category with his intimate black and white portraits of elderly people in China, while Dutch photographer Marsel van Oosten took top honours in the Earth, Air, Fire, Water category, with his eerie images of dead camelthorn trees in the fog in Namibia. Underwater photographer Terry Steeley, who is based in Oxfordshire, UK, was runner-up in the Creative Travel Portfolio category . The 'wonderfully mature' work of Georgia Mulholland in Mykonos, Greece, won her Young Travel Photographer (15 to 18 years) Destinations . Malaysian oral implantologist Nick Ng Yeow Kee made time stand still to win the People & Cultures Portfolio - Tribes category with a set of images, including this one, from the Han Community old people's home in Liuyi Village, Yunnan, China . Indonesia's Michael Theodric was just 12 when he took this shot for the set that won him Young Travel Photographer (under 14 years) Samuel Fisch, from the Bronx in New York City, won the overall Young Photographer prize for his series on seemingly mundane objects in the colourful surrounds of the Venetian island of Burano in Italy. 'He has elegantly captured the essence of the place whilst staying away from the obvious canals and boats to create a clean, cohesive portfolio,' said the judges . Previously trained as an architect, Italy's Massimiliano Fabrizi captured Cuba's 'faded beauty' to win the New Talent Portfolio - Travelogue .

"A Thai AirAsia flight to eastern China was forced to return to Bangkok after an unruly passenger threw a cup of hot water and noodles at a flight attendant. The budget airline said a Chinese passenger berated the woman before scalding her with water on a charter flight to Nanjing on Thursday night. Colleagues administered first aid while the plane returned to Bangkok, where the female passenger and her entourage of three people were kicked off the flight. Thai AirAsia says the passenger berated the female flight attendant before scalding her with hot water . Chinese media reported that instant noodles were thrown at the flight attendant along with the hot water. A video obtained by China National Radio shows a man standing up in the cabin and making a threat to bomb the plane.

The flight attendant's colleagues administered first aid while the plane returned to Bangkok airport . Thai AirAsia did not say if the four passengers were allowed back on the plane when it departed again, almost five hours after its original departure. Incidents involving Chinese tourists making angry outbursts have prompted Beijing to issue stern guidelines on behaving abroad. In February, according to Thai and Chinese news reports, 27 members of a Chinese tour group were ejected from a China Eastern Airlines flight before take-off from the Thai resort island of Phuket after brawling over seating arrangements. Chinese visitors represent the biggest share of tourist arrivals in Thailand.","Thai AirAsia flight was en route to Nanjing, China from Bangkok .

"Horrifying stories of physical and sexual abuse suffered for decades by mixed-race and Aboriginal children at a home in Darwin is unfolding at a national inquiry. Children in care at the Retta Dixon Home were flogged with belt buckles, sexually abused in cars, raped in chicken sheds and chained up in bed 'like a dog', a royal commission heard on Monday. The Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse hearing is sitting in Darwin to examine the home, which from 1946 until 1980, housed children of mixed descent as well as some unmarried mothers. The compelling evidence came from a number of former residents who told of immense cruelty by 'house parents' who oversaw cottages housing up to 12 children at a time in the home run by the Aborigines Inland Mission. Sandra Kitching (pictured) said when she spoke up in protest of a baby being abused that her 'house parent' tore her clothes off and chained her to her bed overnight on chains so short she couldn't sit or sleep properly . Sandra Kitching told the commission her house parent, George Pounder, force-fed an infant cabbage and cauliflower until she was coughing and choking. When Ms Kitching spoke up in protest, she said he tore her clothes off and chained her to her bed overnight on chains so short she couldn't sit or sleep properly. The baby died not long after, she told the commission . Lorna Cubillo, now 78, was born at Banka Banka Station in Central Australia and was taken away from her family in 1947 when she was aged eight and lived at the home until she was 16. One of the girls in her dormitory used to have fits 'and was chained up with a dog chain to her bed', Ms Cubillo told the commission sitting in Darwin on Monday. 'She was fed with an enamel plate and cup, just like a dog, and often had bad chafing around her ankle where the chain would rub.' Ms Cubillo told the commission that Des Walters, who along with his wife were the house parents of her dormitory, was a physically abusive man. 'He flogged me that much that after a while it didn't hurt anymore,' she said. 'I never cried though, and because he wasn't winning he turned the strap around and used the buckle. 'Sometimes he would hit me over the face and head and I would bleed.' He fondled her breasts, and touched her upper thigh in his car, she alleged. 'It was like I was being stalked and everywhere I went, he was there.' A dormitory at Retta Dixon Home where allegations of horrendous abuse is said to have occurred . Although a teacher at school seemed to suspect something was happening, Ms Cubillo never told anyone about the abuse because she was too scared it would get back to Mr Walters and he would beat her. Once, after swimming on a Sunday despite knowing it was against the rules, she said Mr Walters hit her so hard with the buckle end of his belt that he cut her breast. She eventually took court action against him in 1998 regarding the physical abuse, but never told anyone about the sexual abuse. She thinks that was why she lost the case. 'I have tried to get over what happened to me but I just can't get past it,' she said. One witness alleged a girl who failed to properly tidy a kitchen was woken by house mother, Judy Fergusson, and stabbed multiple times on her hands with a can opener until she bled. Children up to the age of 12 who wet the bed would be undressed and paraded in nappies in front of the other children, she said. Children were allegedly flogged with buckles, sexually abused in cars, stabbings and raped in chicken sheds . Former resident Kenneth Stagg said children became overly sexualised because of abuse by staff and other children. One witness, whose identity was suppressed, said boys at the home sexually abused her from the age of five. 'I thought it was normal behaviour and a part of life,' she told the commission. She was sent to foster care in NSW and said one of her foster parents told her it was because Retta Dixon staff were concerned girls would get pregnant. 'I think this shows the staff probably knew that sexual activity was taking place but they failed to protect the children from it,' she said. 'House parents' oversaw cottages housing up to 12 children at a time in the Darwin home . Mr Stagg told the commission under privilege that house parent Mr Henderson 'was well known amongst all the children as a molester'. 'All the children knew Mr Henderson was doing terrible things to the children in No. 2 cottage ... all of the children thought of him as a bad man.' A witness, known as AKU, who lived in a cottage overseen by Henderson said he sexually abused her about twice a week between the ages of five and 13. He once put her on his bed facing a mirror as he made her touch his genitals with her feet. He raped boys in the chook shed, she said. When she was 12, she 'accidentally slammed the car door and Don Henderson swung around and backhanded me in the face and broke my nose'.

"The Cote d’Azur, also known as the French Riviera, was a star-studded playground of celebrities from show business, the art and business world in the middle of the last century. Irish photographer Edward Quinn lived and worked there. Described as a ‘cocktail’ photographer, Quinn charmed the stars vacationing on the strikingly beautiful Mediterranean coastline of the southeast corner of France. They willingly let him photograph them while on holiday, where they brought their furry and no-so-furry friends along or made new ones.  Below are some of the exquisite photographs from the new coffee table book Celebrity Pets on the French Riviera in the 50s and 60s publishes by teNeues publishers. Bathing beauties: French film star Brigitte Bardot sunbathes with her black spaniel, Clown, in 1956 on the French Riviera. Clown was a present from her then husband, film director Roger Vadim. This was the year that the film And God Created Woman launched Bardot to international fame as a sex symbol. Thirty-four years old at the time, she divorced Vadim the following year. Black and white period: Pablo Picasso loved dogs and owned many but his Dalmatian Perro appeared on canvas in some of his later paintings. He lived in a sumptuous 19th century house, Villa La Californie, in the hills above Cannes with an uninterrupted view of the sea. This photo was taken in 1961 . Hold that tiger: American movie star Grace Kelly met Prince Rainier III of Monaco in 1955 for the first time in the private zoo of Rainier’s palace. The photographer, Quinn, suggested that the couple stroll through the zoo as an ice-breaker between the self-conscious couple.The meeting had been arranged by Paris-Match, the French news weekly magazine. Exhausted by a European tour, it is rumored that Grace unsuccessfully tried to cancel this meeting. She returned to Hollywood and their relationship quickly evolved through correspondence. They married the following year. Leap frog: Audrey Hepburn was in Monaco for the movie Monte Carlo Baby at the very beginning of her film career in 1951. It was here in Monte Carlo that she was spotted on the set of the film outside of the Hotel de Paris and chosen to play the role of Gigi that shot her to international stardom. Grrrreat: Film star Elizabeth Taylor was in Cannes in 1957 for the Cannes Film Festival with her then third husband, producer Mike Todd. She is the only one laughing in a close encounter with a large lion cub. On the far left is Art Buchwald, famous New York Herald columnist at the time.

"A newly created suburb in Ballarat has been left without a title when residents rejected naming the area after a respected Indigenous leader, claiming it wasn't in line with the suburb's surroundings and that it needed to be 'anglicised'. More than 100 complaints were lodged with Ballarat City Council when the Wadawurrung Aboriginal Corporation made a submission for the suburb, in Ballarat's West, to be named 'Mullawallah', after one of the last known leaders of the Burrumbeet Balug clan. Sean Fagan, a traditional owner of the land and cultural heritage projects officer for the Corporation, said that he had expected the process to be straightforward, but that many in the Indigenous community had been very hurt by the public's reaction. Sean Fagan (left) with his father Albert Fagan, is a traditional owner of the land and cultural heritage projects officer for the Wadawurrung Aboriginal Corporation, worked closely with the naming officer to submit 'Mullawallah' as the new title for the suburb . On Wednesday night councillors from the Victorian suburb, 105 kilometers from Melbourne, abandoned the name, amid claims from the public that it was too hard to pronounce or spell, and that it could be confused with other suburbs in Australia. A campaign was launched on Facebook to encourage residents to propose new names, and to register to speak out at the meeting against the name. Residents suggested to 'anglicise' the proposed name, and expressed simply 'not liking' the name. 'The majority of objections to the name were around pronunciation and spelling, or that it was too similar to another area where people were saying was potentially an issue for emergencies,' said  Greens councillor Belinda Coates. 'However the name had been given geographical approval, and there is a clause in the guidelines for indigenous names that might hard to pronounce,' she said. 'There's been many different versions for why people don't want the name, people have changed their reasoning, and many have tried to find loopholes when the name already had approval,' Mr Fagan said. 'When the name went out for exhibition there was some misinformation that was leaked to the public, which caused a stir and ended up in a social media frenzy,' he said. On Wednesday night councillors from Ballarat abandoned the name, with claims that it was too hard to pronounce or spell, and that it could be confused with other suburbs in Australia . Residents suggested to 'anglicise' the suggestion of Mullawallah, or expressed simply 'not liking' the name . 'There were suggestions for different names, and a lot of them were jokes, such as 'Beardington', which was very hurtful for the community to see.' Earlier in the week, local Aboriginal elder Ted Lovett claimed that the opposition to the name had been driven by racism, labelling the objections as 'excuses'. Mark Smith, a local resident, said that the claims of racism were enraging. 'This is democracy at its best, the overwhelming response was to reject the name Mullawallah for more than one reason,' Mr Smith told news.com.au. 'The name of a suburb should be in harmony with its surroundings, I don’t believe Mullawallah is in harmony with the surrounds.' Mr Fagan said that Mr Lovett was not a member of the Wadawurrung Aboriginal Corporation, and that the community had stayed away from mentioning racism. He said that he had, however, been confronted by the opposition expressed at Wednesday night's meeting, and had been very uncomfortable 'sitting in a room with 100 people and being the only traditional owner of the land.' 'When the decision was announced people cheered and jeered and heckled, and while we've stayed quiet, that behaviour isn't something I'll be able to forget,' Mr Fagan said. 'The name went out to popular vote, and Aboriginals only make up a small proportion of the population. Sitting in that room last night with 100 people showed me how much Aboriginal people are still at a disadvantage.' 'Not much has changed, we haven't moved very far. Ballarat prides itself on being the birthplace of democracy, but it doesn't work for the Aboriginal people,' he said. 'In the 1800's localities down our way were named after head chiefs and leaders of tribes but it hasn't happened since then.' Mark Smith, a local resident, said that the claims of racism were enraging . A campaign was launched on Facebook to encourage residents to propose new names, and to register to speak out at the meeting against the name . 'The idea of us paying respect through the name of the suburb and to show we've moved on from history was a way for us to educate the community about the history of Ballarat.' Members of the Facebook group suggested paying respects by naming the new ring road in the suburb after Mullawallah instead, or using the leaders' anglicised name of 'Wilson'. 'Australia names places after settlers and historical people all the time, and there are never problems, but as soon as an Aboriginal name comes up people have issues,' said Mr Fagan. One member posted that residents were 'getting labeled rednecks and racists for not caving in...', while another said that locals were happy to have an indigenous name, but wanted one which conformed to Victoria's naming guidelines. 'The council sent all residents the proposal for renaming the area and asked for suggestions for names by a specific date to which the majority went to being named after 'Winter Creek' which runs through the area,' posted a resident. 'We worked closely with the council's naming officer and we ticked all the boxes, and covered all the guidelines,' said Mr Fagan. 'When the submission for the name first went to council there was some misinformation that was spread through the media before the meeting, which caused a stir among the community,' he said. One local posted that residents were 'getting labeled rednecks and racists for not caving in...' Ms Coates requested a deferral at Wednesday's meeting because many from the local Indigenous population had not been able to attend, a move which was denied . 'The name has historical significance not only for the people of Ballarat, but for people all over Australia.' Ms Coates said that in the end it probably came down to a number of residents simply not liking the name. 'Personal taste always going to vary, you're never going to get complete agreement. In this case the new suburb already had a small number of residents, perhaps 400, who may have already had preferences for a name,' she said. Ms Coates requested a deferral at Wednesday's meeting because many from the local Indigenous population had not been able to attend, a move which was denied. 'My motion to defer (based on direct request from Ballarat and district Aboriginal co-op) was in view of the fact that supporters from the affected area, the broader community and indigenous community would not have realised how much weight was given to the views of affected residents,' said Ms Coates. 'The majority of councillors voted against deferral, and voted to abandon the name, which means we are back to the start and there will be a full submission process again,' she said. 'It's so disappointing, it would have been so significant to the Indigenous and Koori community, and a great gesture of respect and support.' 'Faced with such opposition it would be hard to not take the decision personally, as the name is from their traditional language,' she said. Mr Fagan said that the clan would ultimately like to have the suburb named what they had suggested. 'We don’t currently have native title, all our land was taken from us. This has really upset a lot of people on both sides.' 'We should be able to move forward and not be anglicised.'","The name was proposed to pay respect to a local Aboriginal elder .

"An American photographer braved frigid conditions in order to capture these stunning photos of thousands of penguins huddled together on an island in the Antarctic. Mike Johnson, 68, from Estero, Florida, joined several photographers on an expedition on board the Polar Pioneer voyage to the remote South Georgia Island.

Mike Johnson encountered adult king penguins (left) and curious young penguins (right) during his visit to the island . 'We were lucky, according to our guides, in that there are three large king penguin colonies on the island and we were able to land at each of them,' said Mr Johnson. 'To see tens of thousands of immature and adult penguins huddled together in a rookery was an incredible sight. 'I had spent a couple of weeks in the Falklands on a previous trip and to see a rookery with a couple of thousand birds was impressive.

Mr Johnson says that guides told the group that they were lucky, since they were able to land at each of the three penguin colonies . 'But this was over the top. It was more awesome to learn that we were early in the season and there would be more in a few weeks.' South Georgia Island is administered by the United Kingdom as part of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. Despite the wide range and vast numbers of birds and marine life, combined with beautiful scenery, the remote location and lack of access makes the island quite a rare destination for tourists.

South Georgia Island is administered by the United Kingdom as part of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands . Mr Johnson said: 'I remember the scale of the beauty. I remember putting my camera down at a few points and just taking the scenes in.' 'Not only do you have the opportunity to photograph wildlife that you cannot see in other places, the settings are spectacular.' During his visit he managed to see several varieties of the bird including king penguins, rockhoppers, macaroni, chinstrap and gentoo penguins.

Young king penguins were quite curious when they spotted Mr Johnson's camera (left) while adults remained much calmer . Seeing thousands of immature and adult penguins huddled together in a rookery was 'an incredible sight,' says Mr Johnson . Mr Johnson has been travelling the world searching for wildlife and nature photography opportunities since he retired 10 years ago. He said: 'The main motivation for my trip was to step onto Antarctica, which is the last continent I had yet to visit. 'It was a photography trip on a small expedition ship, the Polar Pioneer. Stand tall: With plenty of younger birds in the background, this adult king penguin stands strong on Gold Harbour . This particular photography trip to see penguins in their natural habitat was a small expedition on a small ship called the Polar Pioneer . 'My experience is that smaller groups and smaller ships make for better photo opportunities. 'The ships can land in smaller bays and the group is small enough to enable 'people free' wildlife photos. 'South Georgia turned out to be a highlight. Seals, penguins and other birds are both plentiful and, since they haven't been hunted in many years are very approachable. Mr Johnson says smaller groups and smaller ships make for better photo opportunities, as was the case on South Georgia Island .

'Of course, with some animals, like the beach master Elephant Seals, you kept your distance.' Mr Johnson's journey, which lasted 20 days and encompassed 3,436 nautical miles, also saw him visit the Falkland Islands and Elephant Island as well as the Antarctic Peninsula. He has also had a few other wild adventures in 2014, having been photographing in grizzly bears and cubs in Alaska and jaguars in Brazil.","American photographer, retiree Mike Johnson, joined wildlife expedition to remote South Georgia Island .

"Thibaut Courtois has been ruled out of Chelsea's clash with Hull, paving the way for Petr Cech to make his first Premier League start of the season. Manager Jose Mourinho confirmed today Courtois has picked up a minor injury that will force him to miss the visit of Steve Bruce's side.

But the Czech international has featured in the Capital One Cup and Champions League and Mourinho – who ruled out a return for Fernando Torres from his two-season loan stay at AC Milan – insists the switch will not weaken his side. Mourinho said: 'Courtois had a little problem in training, a muscular problem, and is not available for tomorrow. 'But it's a chance for Petr and a chance for Mark Schwarzer to be on the bench. So I'm more than comfortable. It's a minor problem.' But Mourinho insists Cech has nothing to prove, and remains convinced the keeper will remain at Stamford Bridge beyond next month's transfer window. The manager said: 'He doesn't need to prove anything to me, the club, to his team-mates, to supporters. He has absolutely nothing to prove. 'It's just an easy simple situation for him: go and play, which is what he wants to do and has done throughout his career.

'It's very comfortable for me, the players and the fans to know that our goalkeeper tomorrow is Petr Cech. It's his natural habitat to be in goal and not on the bench. So we are all comfortable with it. 'That's why, since the beginning of the season, it's perfect for me to have Petr in the squad.' Cech has been linked with a move away after losing his starting spot but the manager added: 'I don't think it's possible (for him to leave) and I read his agent saying there's no chance of leaving Chelsea in January.

"A child molester who sexually abused a seven year old girl has claimed that he can't be held  responsible for his action because he suffers from a condition called 'sexsomnia' and was asleep when he attacked her. Caleb Ruh, 29, says had just taken the anti-anxiety drug Xanax and that he was 'sleep sexing' when he grabbed the girl at his home in Flagler County, Florida, in July 2012 and tried to kiss and fondle her. A jury wasn't impressed by his defense and convicted him of lewd and lascivious molestation. He faces life in prison and will be designated a sexual predator, Flagler Live reports. Convicted: Caleb Ruh, 29, claimed he was 'sleep sexing' when he attacked a seven-year-old girl in 2012. A jury didn't believe him and convicted him of lewd and lascivious molestation . People purporting to suffer from sexsomnia appear to be awake and conscious when they engage in sexual behavior, though they are actually asleep and have no memory of the incident. Several research papers have studied the phenomenon, though most prosecutors argue it's being used as an excuse by defendants to escape justice. It's use as a criminal defense has been on the rise. In 2009, a Georgia man was acquitted of molesting a seven-year-old girl after successfully convincing a jury that he was suffering from sexsomnia. In 2012, British actor Simon Morris used the defense when he was charged with raping a 15-year-old girl at a house party in Wales. He was later convicted and sentenced to eight years in prison. The girl told her mother that on another occasion, Ruh blindfolded her and made her play a 'game' where he put things in her mouth and made her guess what they were. Shocking: Ruh's Facebook page includes a picture of him sleeping next to a small child with the caption 'caught napping with my little' girl . Ruh's public defender said that Ruh had no knowledge of either that incident or the July 2012 attack on the girl. After the girl told her mother about the attacks, she moved out of Ruh's house and had her daughter interviewed by officers from a Child Protective Team. That team determined that she had been the victim of 'two acts of sexual violence,' Flagler Live reports. Ruh's Facebook page shows several pictures of a child - including one of him sleeping in bed next to her. The caption reads: 'caught napping with my little' girl.","Caleb Ruh, 29, claimed he was asleep when he attacked the girl .

"Photojournalist Michel du Cille, a three-time Pulitzer Prize winner who recently captured compelling images of Ebola patients and their caretakers, died in Liberia while on assignment for The Washington Post. He was 58. Executive Editor Martin Baron sent a statement to the newspaper staff informing them of du Cille's death. Baron called du Cille 'a beloved colleague and one of the world's most accomplished photographers.' Du Cille found himself at the center of controversy when in October Syracuse University pulled an invitation for du Cille to attend a fall workshop for its communications school after a student raised concerns that he'd recently been in West Africa covering the Ebola crisis. Du Cille insisted he had been symptom-free for the three weeks since his return and said he was 'embarrassed and completely weirded out' by the university's decision. 'The most disappointing thing is that the students at Syracuse have missed that moment to learn about the Ebola crisis, using someone who has been on the ground and seen it up close,' he said. 'But they chose to pander to hysteria.' The Post reported du Cille collapsed Thursday while returning on foot from a Liberian village where he'd been working on an assignment. Award winning: Michel du Cille, a Pulitzer winning photographer with the Washington Post has died while covering Ebola in Liberia . He was taken over dirt roads to a hospital two hours away and was declared dead of an apparent heart attack. Du Cille won two Pulitzer Prizes as a photographer with the Miami Herald in the 1980s and shared a third in 2008 as a reporter with the Post — an investigative public service series on the treatment of veterans at Walter Reed Army Medical Center who were returning from Afghanistan and Iraq. He won his first Pulitzer for their coverage of a volcano eruption in Colombia in 1985. His second Pulitzer was won for work documenting life inside a crack house in Miami, which revealed the devastating effect it had on the local community. 'He was a courageous witness and a powerful storyteller,' said Kenny Irby, with the Poynter Institute in Florida to The Washington Post. He also spent several years as The Post's director of photography and an assistant managing editor. The experienced photographer frequently featured those suffering deprivation as the subjects of his work. He traveled to Sudan and Afghanistan for assignments and came under fire while working in the war torn countries. Tragic: Michel du Cille was working in Liberia when he passed away of an apparent heart attack and was pronounced dead in the hospital . Pullitzer winning: This April 5, 1987 photo submitted by the Miami Herald is part of the 1988 Pulitzer Prize in feature photography by Michel du Cille on his photo essay on crack cocaine addicts in a Miami housing . Powerful: This photograph is from the same Miami crack photography project that Du Cille, a three-time Pulitzer Prize winner captured in the late 1980s . Prize: Du Cille, a three-time Pulitzer Prize winner who recently captured compelling images of Ebola patients and their caretakers, died on Thursday, December  11, 2014, in Liberia . Du Cille also covered the civil wars that raged in Liberia and Sierra Leone that broke out in the 1990s and then finally, the Ebola outbreak in Africa. 'It is profoundly difficult not to be a feeling human being while covering the Ebola crisis,' Mr. du Cille wrote in The Post in October. 'Sometimes, the harshness of a gruesome scene simply cannot be sanitized. . . . But I believe that the world must see the horrible and dehumanizing effects of Ebola. 'The story must be told; so one moves around with tender care, gingerly, without extreme intrusion.' He returned to West Africa this year to cover the Ebola outbreak, sometimes wearing heavy rubber gloves as he took the pictures of the patients. Loss; Michel du Cille with his second wife, Nikki Kahn, who also is a photographer at the Washington Post . Born in 1956 in Kingston, Jamaica, du Cille moved with his family to the state of Georgia in the 1970s, where he began his career as a photographer at the Gainesville Times. He graduated from Indiana University in 1981 and received a master's degree in journalism from Ohio University in 1994. He is survived by his wife, Post photographer Nikki Kahn, and two children from a previous marriage. Arrangements were being made to bring his body to Monrovia, Liberia's capital, Information Minister Lewis Brown told The Associated Press on Friday.","Michel du Cille has passed away suddenly aged 58 in Liberia .

"New emails released early Friday in the Sony hack reveal a shocking incident of nepotism between Sony Chair Amy Pascal, her husband and New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd. In a column Dowd was writing about women in Hollywood shortly after the 2014 Academy Awards, citing the box office success of female-fronted films such as The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, Gravity, Frozen and The Heat, she asked to interview Pascal, the only female head of a major studio. Pascal however is shown to be hesitant in emails exchanged between herself and husband Bernie Weinraub, until Weinraub reveals that he will be seeing the column before it is published and Dowd assures Pascal she will look 'great' in the article. The end result is a Times piece that makes Pascal look incredible, a woman who has had huge Hollywood hits but also worked to change the film industry's sexist attitudes as the Sony exec goes so far as to call out the 'paltry' amount of money women in the business get - this despite the fact that at $3million a year she is the highest paid employee at Sony. Scroll down for video . Spousal perk: Amy Pascal (left) was promised she would look 'great' in a New York Times column that her husband Bernie Wenraub (left) was able to see before publication . Nepotism: The column's writer, Maureen Dowd (above), previously worked with Weinraub when he was at the Times . This perk no doubt came as a result of the fact that Weinraub spent over a decade working for the Times as the paper's Hollywood correspondent, leaving in 2005, about a year before his wife would be named to her current post. The emails, obtained by Buzzfeed, show that Dowd emailed Pascal on March 3 for comment on the column, saying; 'i would make sure you look great and we’d check it all and do it properly.' Pascal then contacts her husband before speaking to Dowd, who reveals he is aware the columnist had reached out as he had already spoken to her. 'I said the rap that you jus like to make womens films is unfair amnd sexist,' says Weinraub. 'You made all these “women’s movies ===league of their own, 28 days,,,the nora Ephron films…zero dark…. but you also do spifderman… denzel….Jonah hill…..bad teacher etc etc.' He then tells his wife that he already knows the column will be based around a quote Cate Blanchett gave when accepting her Academy Award for Best Actress in Blue Jasmine, though he misidentifies her as 'Cate Winslett.' Tense meeting: On Wednesday, Dowd came face-to-face with Angelina Jolie (above), a day after emails leaked in which she attacked the star's planned remake of Cleopatra . Pascal responds just two minutes later, writing; 'IM NOT TALKING TO HER IF SHE IS GONNA SLAM ME. PLEASE FIND OUT.' It is at that point that Weinraub tells his wife; 'you cant tell single person that I’m seeing the column before its printed…its not done…no p.r. people or Lynton or anyone should know.' 'Lynton' is Michael Lynton, the co-chair of Sony Entertainment. 'When Pascal greenlit Nora Ephron and Nancy Meyers rom-coms, some male executives sniffed “So what’s next?”' Dowd writes in her column. 'Adam Sandler, Will Smith, the Spider-Man franchise, The Social Network, and this year’s American Hustle and Captain Phillips impressed the guys in the boardroom.' Just 10 minutes after the column was published, Charles Sipkins, then the head of communications at Sony, forwarded it to Pascal and Lynton, remarking on how 'impressive' it was. Dowd and Pascal also exchanged loving emails after the column appeared online, with Pascal calling Dowd her 'favorite person' and Dowd telling Pascal, 'you’re mine! you’re amazing.' Weinraub, when reached for comment, told a reporter; 'I have no idea what you’re talking about.' Dowd meanwhile says she never promised Weinraub a look at her column. 'I never showed Bernie the column in advance or promised to show it. Bernie is an old friend and the Times’ former Hollywood reporter, and he sometimes gives me ideas for entertainment columns,' she said in a statement to The Wrap. 'In January, he suggested a column, inspired by a study cited in the L.A. Times, about the state of women in Hollywood. Amy is a friend and I reassured her before our interview that it wasn't an antagonistic piece. She wasn't the focus of the story, nor was Sony.' She then added; 'I emailed with Bernie and talked to him before I wrote the column in March, getting his perspective on the Hollywood old boys’ club and the progress of women. But I didn't send him the column beforehand.' Bad combo: On Thursday, racist emails about President Barack Obama between Pascal and producer Scott Rudin (above) were leaked . Calling them out: Actor Kevin Hart (right) has called out Pascal (center) and Sony producer Clint Culpepper (left) over their 'ignorant' comments . This email exchange is just the latest released in the Sony hack, as Pascal continues to be hit harder than anyone else involved in the incident, carried out by a group called Guardians of Peace. Pascal apologized for her language in some of the emails Thursday, this after a racist exchange she and producer Scott Rudin had about President Barack Obama went public. 'The content of my emails were insensitive and inappropriate but are not an accurate reflection of who I am,' said Pascal. 'Although this was a private communication that was stolen, I accept full responsibility for what I wrote and apologize to everyone who was offended.' Pascal also came face-to-face with Angelina Jolie on Wednesday after a heated exchange between her and Rudin was leaked by Gawker in which they admonished the star for having an 'rampaging spoiled ego' over her planned Cleopatra remake, which Sony was working on. In a photo from the event Jolie appears to be giving Pascal a remarkably icy stare as the seemingly frazzled Pascal frantically grips the actress' arms. On Thursday Pascal sat down for her first interview following the hack, explaining to The Wrap where she goes from here. 'I have a studio to run. We are putting movies out. Everyone here is working,' she said. 'I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy. It's business as usual here.' She then states that she does not believe this hack has damaged her to the point where she can no longer be an effective executive. Pascal, who grew up in Los Angeles, began her career as a secretary at Sony, working her way up to the top post over the course of 20 years. Industry site Deadline is saying however that these leaked emails may mean the end for Pascal at the studio.","New emails released in the Sony hack reveal that Amy Pascal was promised favorable coverage in a New York Times column .

"It was the moment two armies laid down their weapons in friendship for a single day before returning to the slaughter the following day. Now, the Duke of Cambridge has paid tribute to the famous Christmas Day truce of 1914, describing it as 'a message of hope and humanity'. William was speaking during a dedication ceremony of a monument to the moment at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire. Scroll down for video . Hope: The Duke of Cambridge described the Christmas Day truce as 'a message of hope and humanity' Schoolboy Spencer Turner’s design for the monument was chosen from among hundreds of others by the Duke and England forward Theo Walcott  following a national competition. The memorial shows the hands of an English and German soldier clasped in friendship inside a steel representation of a football. 'We all grew up with the story of soldiers from both sides putting down their arms to meet in no man’s land on Christmas Day 1914 - when gunfire remarkably gave way to gifts,' said the prince. 'It remains wholly relevant today as a message of hope and humanity, even in the bleakest of times. Football, then as now, had the power to bring people together and break down barriers.' The winning entry was designed by the 10-year-old during lessons at his school, Farne Primary, which sits in the shadow of Newcastle United’s St James’ Park. Monument: William arrives with FA chairman Greg Dyke and the Lord Lieutenant of Staffordshire, Ian Dudson . Warm: William, who is president of the FA, greets England manager, Roy Hodgson . Spencer was told his design had been chosen to be the Football Remembers memorial by Newcastle players Steven Taylor and Adam Armstrong at a special assembly in October. The Duke, who has been president of the FA since 2006, said he had captured 'the very essence of the Christmas Truce with his stunning design'. He added: 'It is vital that 100 years on, we keep the Christmas Truce story alive - that moment captured so beautifully by Spencer when hands that had held weapons came together in peaceful greeting. 'For future generations, this memorial will help ensure that not just football, but also a nation, remembers.' William also spoke about the large number of football events being staged to mark the memorable moment in 1914. He said: 'This week, teams at every level of the game have been coming together before matches to unite for mixed team photos, evoking the spirit of the Christmas Truce. Unusual: The royal made his entrance in a golf buggy, driven by National Memorial Arboretum staff . All smiles: England manager Roy Hodgson was at the National Memorial Arboretum for the ceremony . Good work: The Duke of Cambridge chats to a delighted Spencer Turner after the ceremony . All smiles: The Duke and the Newcastle schoolboy share a joke during their chat . 'This weekend, young footballers from the nations who fought against each other in 1914 will come together in Ypres to compete in the Premier League Christmas Truce International Tournament. 'Next Wednesday, the British Army will take on the German Army in a special football match, which promises to be truly poignant as serving soldiers repeat this remarkable occasion 100 years on.' Speaking ahead of the royal guest, FA chairman Greg Dyke told the guests, who included England manager Roy Hodgson, how he had visited World War I battle sites on the continent. 'Yesterday I was on the actual site of one of the events of the 1914 Christmas Day Truce, the kickabout between British and German soldiers,' he said. 'What I found interesting was that both British and German football supporters had been visiting the site for many years, leaving scarves and other mementos in remembrance of those who played and those who died. 'These unofficial gestures by fans have prompted UEFA to build a formal memorial which was opened yesterday.' Welcome: The Duke of Cambridge welcomes schoolboy designer Spencer Turner to the stage . Proud: William and FA chairman Greg Dyke chat to the schoolboy and his delighted family after the ceremony . Off you go: After making his speech, Prince William escorted a beaming Spencer Turner away . Mr Dyke added: 'We were told the stories of what had happened on that Christmas Day, how amid the despair and the destruction the human spirit still flourished. 'How men from both sides were able to overcome the nightmare of mass warfare and celebrate Christmas together with a drink, a chat, a cigarette and famously a game of football. Smiling, he added: 'Predictably, the story goes the Germans won on penalties.' During the dedication ceremony for the Football Remembers memorial, Brigadier Steve Vickery, from the Army Football Association, read the famous verse from the poem For The Fallen, which begins with the line: “They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old.” The poignant ceremony ended with a rendition of the Last Post, played by a bugler. Speaking after the ceremony, schoolboy designer Spencer praised sculptor Georgie Welch for her ""really accurate"" bronze of his design. The 10-year-old, who helped to carve the year 1914 on the stone memorial last month, said: 'It was just an amazing experience and I will always remember the day. To think that the prince has chosen my design over the rest, I am really proud of myself.' Spencer's headteacher, his parents and several other members of his family, including his eight-year-old brother Frazer and sister Maisie, two, were also present at the service. Impressive: The clasped hands design was picked from thousands of entries following a national competition . Poignant: The sculpture marks the football match between British and German troops on Christmas Day 1914 . Saddened: Prince William laid a wreath before standing for a moment and remembering the men . Friendly: William with servicemen from the Mercian Regiment and their mascot, Swaledale ram LCpl Derby . His mother Stacey Bird admitted to feeling 'choked' as Spencer joined William to jointly unveil his work. 'Just to see the prince talking to my son, I was just choked,' she said. 'I don't think that image will ever leave me. It was an amazing service and I am immensely proud.' Spencer's mother said he set his heart on winning the competition because of his passion for art, history and football, and because his great-great grandfather and great- great uncle both died in the First World War. The 31-year-old added: 'Seeing Spencer's work come to life and people recognising his talent is every mother's dream. 'It also means a lot that the memorial is British-made. It honours those who fought and it's going to stay there forever.' Virginia Crompton, of the British Council, also praised Spencer's winning entry, saying: 'What Spencer has done is to take the old-style football and make that into a kind of skeleton. 'In the middle there are two hands in a very muscular hand-shake and when you look at it, he has brilliantly brought together the story of the truce and football.' Inspiration: The sculpture was based on this sketch drawn by Spencer Turner, aged ten, from Newcastle . Talented: The schoolboy's intricate and poignant sketch won a competition to be used as the design for the sculpture at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire . Remembering the dead: The Duke of Cambridge lays a wreath at the base of the memorial . Visit: FA chairman Greg Dyke revealed that he recently visited the site of the Christmas Day truce . Remembrance: The Duke of Cambridge left a handwritten note along with his wreath of poppies . 'As President of The Football Association and Patron of the National Memorial Arboretum Appeal, I am delighted to be here today, and to welcome you all to the unveiling of this magnificent new Christmas Truce memorial. It really is the most fitting culmination of the Football Remembers programme, and will serve as a permanent reminder of one of the key moments of the First World War. We all grew up with the story of soldiers from both sides putting down their arms to meet in no-man’s land on Christmas Day 1914 – when gunfire remarkably gave way to gifts. It remains wholly relevant today, as a message of hope and humanity, even in the bleakest of times. Football, then as now, had the power to bring people together and break down barriers. In getting to this point 100 years on, I must pay tribute to the British Council for their work in creating a superb education resource which went out to more than 30,000 schools across the country. The FA, the Premier League and Football League then used this as inspiration to put together a fantastic series of activities to bring the events of the 25th of December 1914 to life. This week, teams at every level of the game have been coming together before matches to unite for mixed team photos – evoking the spirit of the Christmas Truce. This weekend, young footballers from the nations who fought against each other in 1914 will come together in Ypres to compete in the Premier League Christmas Truce International Tournament. Next Wednesday, the British Army will take on the German Army in a special football match, which promises to be truly poignant as serving soldiers repeat this remarkable occasion 100 years on. Yet for all the undoubted power of these activities, it was felt - this year - that the Christmas Truce also story needed a permanent focal point: a place for people to pay their respects. So, to today’s ceremony and the creation of a lasting monument here at the National Memorial Arboretum. I was personally delighted to join Theo Walcott in judging a design competition involving schools from across the country. We were both impressed with the creativity and thought put in by so many talented young people. Ultimately, though, we were left with a stand-out winner. Spencer Turner from Farne Primary in Newcastle captured the very essence of the Christmas Truce with his stunning design. I know his family, friends, teachers and class-mates joining us today are extremely proud. It is vital that, 100 years on, we keep the Christmas Truce story alive – that moment captured so beautifully by Spencer when hands that had held weapons came together in peaceful greeting. For future generations, this memorial will help ensure that not just football – but, also a nation – remembers.","The Duke of Cambridge was in Staffordshire to unveil new memorial .

"The last time Graziano Pelle can remember playing in a such a one-side game was in the tiny square outside his house in Lecce, southern Italy. It was there that the young Pelle would score goals and celebrate like Alan Shearer, trying to replicate his Premier League hero. He wanted to be like Shearer: a powerful, bustling striker with a bullet header and shot like thunder. Little did he know that, at the age of 29, he would realise his dream. VIDEO Scroll down to watch An unbelievable result - Koeman . Graziano Pelle scored twice (he wants to claim a third) as Southampton beat Sunderland 8-0 on Saturday . Pelle claims he idolised former Newcastle striker Alan Shearer, and Marco van Basten, when he was younger . Pelle strikes home his second goal during the thrashing of the hapless Black Cats at St Mary's . 7 Graziano Pelle has had a hand in seven goals in his last six games, scoring six and assisting one. 4 Dusan Tadic joined Santi Cazorla, Emmanuel Adebayor, Cesc Fabregas, Jose Antonio Reyes and Dennis Bergkamp as the only men with four PL assists in a game. Nor that it would be at Southampton, the club where the teenaged Shearer broke through to become one of the greatest forwards in English football. Pelle claimed two more strikes in the thrashing of Sunderland — making it six goals in eight Premier League appearances since he signed in the summer — and ran the opposition’s back line ragged. He said: ‘When I was young and I scored, it was “a great Van Basten” or “a great Shearer”. When you are young, you want to be someone who is already in the Premier League or Serie A. ‘Now I’m happy that I am here. I see a lot of love from kids who want to be me. I have to always show them that with work you can reach what you want to reach.’ Pelle was only denied a hat-trick by the combination of a half-save from Sunderland goalkeeper Vito Mannone and the ineptitude of midfielder Liam Bridcutt. Pelle wants to keep the match ball as his shot was heading in before Liam Bridcutt (r) bundled it over the line . Santiago Vergini got a miserable day going for Sunderland with a sliced own goal . Pelle and Ronald Koeman picked up the Players' and Manger of the month awards for September . VIDEO An unbelievable result - Koeman . His strike was powerful and Mannone could only push it to one side. The ball was creeping towards the goal-line until Bridcutt got it caught in his feet and bundled it over the line. But Pelle is determined to keep the match-ball for scoring three. ‘We are going to ask them to give me the third goal,’ he explained. ‘The club is going to fight for it. One goal counts! For a striker, it always counts.’ Considering goals were few and far between in the early part of Pelle’s career, struggling in Serie A in his teens and early 20s, it is understandable he is so keen to add as many to his name as he can. Scoring has come far easier in the past two seasons. Moving to Holland’s Eredivisie, first to AZ Alkmaar where he played for Louis Van Gaal and then Feyenoord under Ronald Koeman, ignited Pelle. He won the league but was not prolific at Alkmaar. In two seasons at Feyenoord he struck 50 goals in 57 league games before Koeman took Pelle with him to Southampton for £8million. The Italian striker was not prolific at AZ Alkmaar before joining Feyernoord . Pelle scored on his Italian debut against Malta in a Euro 2016 qualifier last week . Continuing that form into this season has finally earned him a call-up to the Italy side and he netted on his debut, against Malta, during the international break. A few days later he was named the Barclays Premier League player of the month and celebrated by starring in one of the biggest wins in league history. ‘It was the best week of my career,’ he added. ‘I had great moments in the past. I was happy in many situations. But this is something I am doing in a higher league, the best competition in the world. I believe in myself, I believe in the team. I just want to keep going, it’s just the beginning. We are in October. It will be really bad to stop now because it doesn’t have meaning. If we stop now, at the end of the season nobody will remember.’ He is scoring goals which Shearer would surely have been proud of. For instance, against Queens Park Rangers when he flicked the ball up and sent it into the top-right corner with an overhead kick. But while Pelle is earning plaudits for finding the net, Serbia’s Dusan Tadic — another Koeman recruit bought from FC Twente — is pulling the strings. Against Sunderland, not only did Tadic score, he set up four of the other goals. Pelle said: ‘When I was in Holland, I had a question: which player would you like to play with? I said: “Dusan. Many No 10s are a bit selfish. Not Dusan. He always wants to be dangerous”.’ Summer signing Dusan Tadic jumps into the arms of Italian forward Pelle after scoring his side's sixth goal .

"Adrian Williams is a father, grandfather and husband. He is also a convicted paedophile who hid a disturbing secret from his two wives. Under such unfortunate circumstances, Australian mothers and divorcees Belinda and Maggie have come together to reveal their ex-husband's dark past for fear that he may strike again. Scroll down for video . Adrian Williams, a paedophile, kept his disturbing dark secret from his two wives . Belinda (left) is from Mr William's first marriage and Maggie (right) from his second . Mr Williams was aged 16 when he married Belinda, who was a 20-year-old single mother at the time. She already had two sons from a previous marriage but went on to have three more with Mr Williams. Her suspicions began when her five-year-old son warned his teacher at school that she would be wary of his father. 'There was a parent teacher interview coming up and he kept telling the teacher ""you're going to be scared of my dad"",' Belinda told A Current Affair. 'He then started saying explicit things about sex that a five-year-old shouldn't know.' A two-page confessional letter from Mr Williams addressed to Belinda confirmed her worst nightmare - that her husband was sexually abusing his own biological son. The full details of the letter cannot be reported as it is too graphic. Mr Williams confessed that he sexually abused his sons in a two-page letter to Belinda . Belinda showed the letter to Maggie as she revealed to her the horrific truth . Mr Williams met Maggie whilst he was on parole. She had no idea that she married a convicted child molester . The criminal was 16 when he first married Belinda, a 20-year-old single mother at the time . 'I would tell the boys to go into the bedroom,' he wrote. 'I would always say it when they were in another room so I didn't see the look on their faces. 'I am unfit to be called a husband and a father. Please tell my boys that I am sorry for what I have done to them and to you. Because none of you deserve it.' Mr Williams was consequently convicted for the crime and sent to jail for six years. Noel McNamara, from the Crime Victims Support Association, says the system is protecting paedophiles . But both Belinda and second wife Maggie agree that his punishment wasn't enough. 'He took my kid's life. He took my life. His life should be gone too,' Belinda said. The two women describe him as 'scum', 'manipulative' and 'a cheater'. But while on parole he met Maggie - who was also a single mother at the time - and went on to have two children with her. She had no clue that the man she married was a convicted child molester. 'It just makes me sick,' Maggie said. 'I can't believe I didn't see all this. It's almost as if he doesn't care. 'He should've never been allowed to have more children.' Belinda broke the shocking truth to Maggie which left her in tears. Noel McNamara, from the Crime Victims Support Association, says he is disgraced by the 'leniency' and 'mercy' of the system which protects paedophiles and their identity. 'It's just wrong and it's a disgrace,' he said. Meanwhile, Mr Williams has moved to country Victoria where he's settled in with another single mother. When approached for comment, he simply drove away. Mr McNamara says Mr William's actions are 'pure evil'. Both his ex-wives are sickened by Mr William's and hope he doesn't fool other women.

"Divock Origi’s loan spell at Lille took a turn for the worst on Thursday night after he was booed by his own supporters. The Liverpool striker, who signed for the Reds after an encouraging World Cup for Belgium in the summer, missed a penalty in the Europa League in a 3-0 defeat against Wolfsburg. Costing Brendan Rodgers £10million, Origi’s year back at Lille was seen as a chance to hone consistency in front of goal. On-loan striker Divock Origi had a Europa League night to forget against Wolfsburg after he missed a penalty . It is 923 minutes since the striker has scored and the fans showed their anger as they booed him off the pitch . The 19-year-old is on loan from Liverpool for the rest of this season following his £10million summer move . But the teenager has now gone a staggering 923 minutes without finding the net – his last goal coming against Wolfsburg at the beginning of October. Games: 19 . Goals: 4 . Games since his last goal: 10 . And enough was enough for French fans, who heckled Origi’s every touch after his penalty was saved by Diego Benaglio. They are worrying signs for Rodgers, whose own front men have spectacularly failed so far this season. Without Luis Suarez – sold to Barcelona – and missing the injured Daniel Sturridge, Liverpool have scored just 19 goals in the Premier League. Liverpool striker Luis Suarez celebrates scoring against Norwich during the 3-2 win in the Premier League . Sturridge has not played for Liverpool since August and will remain out until next year due to a thigh injury . Sturridge scores for Liverpool during their 2-1 victory over Southampton on the first day of the season . Mario Balotelli has failed to live up to expectations since arriving at Anfield for £16m this summer . By this stage last season Luis Suarez had 15 League goals. So far this term, it's a totally different story for Liverpool front men... Mario Balotelli – two goals in 14 games . Rickie Lambert – two goals in 18 games . Daniel Sturridge – one goal in three games . In all competitions, it’s been 442 minutes since a Liverpool striker last scored for them (Lambert v Ludogorets) Last season's second top goalscorer Daniel Sturridge has been sidelined for a number of months after suffering an injury whilst on England duty in early September. Since then he has not played a single minute for Liverpool, having been hit with another injury (thigh) that will keep him out until the New Year. The 25-year-old formed a formidable partnership with Luis Suarez, scoring 21 Premier League goals for the Reds last term. Sturridge has featured for Rodgers' side just three times in the League this season, scoring once against Southampton on the opening day. His replacements have not been much more prolific either. Controversial £16million summer signing Mario Balotelli has netted only twice in 14 shows for the Merseyside club. Manager Brendan Rodgers has backed his decision to take a gamble on 24-year-old striker Balotelli . In addition, the former AC Milan striker regularly attracts the spotlight for his behaviour off the pitch, as well as on it. With former Italy manager Giovanni Trapattoni saying on Thursday that the 24-year-old is wasting his career, he will be hoping to improve on his poor start to life in Liverpool as he returns from a groin injury to face Manchester United on Sunday. Also on the list of misfiring forwards at the Anfield club is Rickie Lambert, who joined his hometown club in the summer. Dream move it may have been, but the former Southampton man has an even worse record in front of goal than that of fellow strike partner Balotelli - just two in 18 games. To make matters worse, manager Brendan Rodgers hauled him off at half time as Liverpool were eliminated form the Champions League after their 1-1 draw with Basle.

"Roberto Martinez used Everton's dead-rubber clash with Krasnodar to show off the club's young diamonds and, on this showing, the Toffees may have unearthed a real gem. Boasting one of Europe's finest left backs in Leighton Baines, Everton appear to have a more than able deputy waiting in the wings. Luke Garbutt has possibly one of the most difficult jobs in football on his hands in trying to usurp Baines from the Everton first-team but on Thursday night the defender showed he is more than capable of holding his own on the big stage. Defender Luke Garbutt was Everton's best player as the Toffees lost 1-0 to Krasnodar in the Europa League . First-team left back Leighton Baines (centre) watches Garbutt in action at Goodison Park on Thursday night . Ryan Ledson (left) was another Everton youngster to be given a chance to impress against the Russian side . Follow all the latest #UEL action on: . Facebook: UEFAEuropaLeague . Twitter: @EuropaLeague . And at uefa.com . Arriving at the club from Leeds United as a 16-year-old in 2009 for a fee of £600,000, Evertonians will have heard Garbutt's name from time to time as 'one for the future' but have rarely had a chance to see him play until now. With England Under 21s manager Gareth Southgate casting his eye over the Blues' youngsters here at Goodison Park, Garbutt will have certainly caught his attention. Helping to keep a clean sheet in the Toffees' 2-0 victory over Wolfsburg, Garbutt gave a composed and assured performance way beyond his years last month. Once again, in his second Europa League start, the defender looked a natural. Dependable and sturdy at the back, it was Garbutt's lung-busting runs forward and pinpoint crossing which really got the Everton faithful excited. Positionally sound, the Harrogate-born full back was full of running and showed great confidence striding forward and, at one point, appeared to rob the ball off the more experienced Steven Pienaar on the wing as the South African pondered what to do next. Left back Garbutt bursts through Krasnodar's defence on a rain-soaked night at Goodison Park . Everton boss Roberto Martinez (right) gives Garbutt some advice on his second start for the club . Garbutt faces the unenviable task of trying to take Baines' (right) spot in Everton's starting XI . Pass accuracy: 82 per cent . Chances created: 4 . Take-ons completed: 3 . Constantly looking to make things happen, Garbutt's intention every time he received the ball was to march towards the byline and cross for the frontmen. With pinpoint accuracy, this wasn't a player aimlessly lofting the ball into the area – Garbutt knew exactly where to put it. Curling crosses, pull backs, drilling the ball, the full back mixed it up and his deliveries kept the Krasnodar defence guessing throughout. The initiative showed will certainly please manager Martinez and Garbutt, who spent a portion of last season on loan at Colchester, has certainly benefited from having a player like Baines to learn from. It is a big ask to get ahead of the England left back, the player who has assisted so many goals – and scored a few himself, too – for Everton over the past few years but Garbutt certainly has the capabilities to play in the Premier League. As Martinez's team evolves Garbutt may in fact get his chance with Baines still in the side. The Spaniard has admitted in the past that Everton's current No 3 could follow in the footsteps of Philipp Lahm and move to midfield which would allow Garbutt a chance. For the first time ever, the Europa League winners will play in the Champions League next term and while Martinez will strive to pick his strongest XI from here on in, this competition may be the platform for Garbutt to shine on as the Toffees continue into the knockout stages on the road to Warsaw.

Former Leeds full back Garbutt is fouled Krasnodar's Sergei Petrov after a powerful run forward . Kieran Dowell (left) came off the bench early on to make his senior Everton debut at the age of just 17 . With the Merseysider's progress ensured before kick-off, the youngster certainly got Everton fans talking and was a high point on a night when an opportunity for the club's academy lads was more important than the result . Supporters, including Cockney Blues Daniel and Dale Drury - showing real commitment travelling all the way up from London to Liverpool for a fixture with nothing riding on it - were excited at the prospect at seeing Everton's academy crop in action. Despite the 1-0 defeat, Martinez's decision to blood the youngsters paid dividends. Seeing the next generation of Blues performing so confidently in a competitive fixture has given Evertonians reason to be cheerful about the future. Tyias Browning stuck to his defensive duties well, 17-year-old midfielder Ryan Ledson was confident and tidy in possession while Conor McAleny was constantly looking to make things happen playing behind Kone as well as out wide. However, Garbutt was the one who stood out. Everton have a real player on their hands and the left back would not look out of place in the first-team.","Everton lost 1-0 to Krasnodar in the Europa League on Thursday .

Napoli boss Rafael Benitez may bring Torres to the Stadio San Paolo on an initial six-month deal . But Napoli need a back-up striker for Gonzalo Higuain and Torres will be available on a free transfer – despite having been worth £50m when he joined Chelsea almost four years ago. Torres is on a two-year loan from Chelsea to AC Milan but is not expected back at Stamford Bridge and Milan have come to the conclusion that the striker is not going to fit in at the San Siro. Napoli would consider taking him for an initial six months. Benitez signed Torres for £26m at Liverpool and was his manager during his golden period at the club, during which he scored 81 goals in 142 appearances. Napoli are short of back-up for first choice striker Gonzalo Higuain and Torres could do a job . He then managed him at Chelsea for six months in 2013, during which Torres produced some of his better form for the club, scoring 16 goals in 44 games, including the first in their victory in the Europa League Cup final win against Benfica. Napoli are currently fifth in Serie A and are in the last 32 of the Europa League.

"He may not be back to his absolute best yet, but Robin van Persie's recent goalscoring form looks to have boosted his confidence ahead of Manchester United's game with Liverpool. The Holland striker, who has scored three goals in his last three Premier League games, is beginning to find his form after a slow start to the season, finding the net twice against Southampton despite limited chances. And Van Persie seems ready to continue his good form against bitter rivals Liverpool on Sunday after enjoying a strenuous training session with his team-mates on Friday morning.

This isn't the 33-year-old's first venture into beauty. In fact, she is set to have the biggest-selling celebrity fragrance of 2014. The Drunk In Love singer's Rise perfume is expected to sell more than 750,000 units in the UK, which will apparently net her £1.5m. Escentual.com CEO Rakesh Aggarwal said: 'Most celebrities earn around £2 per bottle sold of fragrance. 'Clearly deals vary in every case but generally it's around 8 to 10 per cent royalty on the profit, so with the huge number of sales for these celebrities in the top ten they are going to have a rather lucrative Christmas this year.' Business brains: Beyonce has teamed up with billionaire Topshop owner Sir Philip Green, centre with Cara Delevingne, to produce a range of high fashion sportswear . Indeed, the six editions of her fragrances are the world's best-selling celebrity fragrance line, with sales worth over £250m. The global style icon is also sure to get a bank balance boost from her upcoming fashion collaboration. Beyonce, mother to Blue Ivy Carter, her daughter with husband Jay Z, has teamed up with billionaire Topshop owner Sir Philip Green to produce a range of high fashion sportswear. The singer, who made her name with Destiny’s Child, one of the best-selling girl groups of all time, has formed a joint venture called Parkwood TopShop Athletic producing ‘global athletic street-wear’.

"Thousands of Yazidis are still trapped on Mount Sinjar, almost completely surrounded by ISIS who lurk at the bottom of the ridge in northern Iraq. As ISIS cornered 50,000 Yazidis atop the mountain back in August, threatening them with genocide and the rape of their women, President Barack Obama ordered U.S. airstrikes on the Islamic extremists while the UK dropped aid to those in need. But just four months later, the world has moved on, forgetting about the plight of the 8,000 men, women and children who are still trapped on Mount Sinjar, with just a handful rescued in the last few weeks. Scroll down for video . The Iraqi air force continues to rescue Yazidis by the handful, but as many as 8,000 are said to still be trapped on top of Mount Sinjar . Helicopters drop in aid to those trapped on the mountain, which is almost completely surrounded by ISIS militants . Tents belonging to Yazidi refugees, stranded after being surrounded by ISIS insurgents, are seen on Mount Sinjar . A lucky few of the thousands of Yazidis on Mount Sinjar are rescued and taken to a UN refugee camp in Faysh Khabur, on the Syrian border . Despite U.S. and Iraqi airstrikes, ISIS militants still control the foot of the mountain, except in the western village of Bara where government forces are reported to be back in control. Syrian-Kurdish fighters had kept a corridor open next to the 45-mile ridge, allowing Yazidis to flee to safety, but an ISIS offensive re-captured the escape route. While ISIS are kept at bay for the time being, may fear the few Iraqi aid supply drops that can get through to the Yazidis may not be enough to see them through the cold of winter. The only chance for the trapped Yazidis to escape is via helicopters from the Iraqi Air Force, which has been able to rescue many from Mount Sinjar, dropping them at a UN refugee camp in Faysh Khabur, on the Syrian border. Since the extremists' attack in August, 5,000 Yazidis have been killed on Mount Sinjar, with a further 7,000 women and girls kept as sex slaves. Yazidis are trapped on Mount Sinjar, which, over than a small section to the west (shaded) is surrounded by ISIS militants .

Although a well publicised exodus of Yazidi refugees took place from Mount Sinjar in August 2014 many still remain on top of the 45-mile long ridge-line . Despite efforts to stop the ISIS offensive, 5,000 Yazidis are said to have died on Mount Sinjar with thousands more women captured . Some of the killings were brutally simplistic, with people lined up at checkpoints, shot dead, then bulldozed into mass graves. Others were herded into temples which were later blown up. UN researchers said hundreds more men had been killed for refusing to convert to Islam. Tens of thousands of Yazidis fled into the Sinjar Mountains after the militant onslaught on Sinjar, part of ISIS' lightning advance into north and western Iraq. Iraq's Human Rights Ministry said at the time that hundreds of women were abducted by the militants, who consider the Yazidis, a centuries-old religious minority, a heretical sect. Human Rights Watch said ISIS 'separated young women and teenage girls from their families and has forced some of them to marry its fighters'. One woman told the organisation that she saw Islamic State fighters buying girls, and a teenage girl said a fighter bought her for $1,000.

"Shonda Rhimes, the creator of 'Scandal' and 'Grey's Anatomy', has slammed an email exchange leaked in the Sony hack - and called out the media for not taking a stronger stance against it. In the exchange, Sony Pictures Co-Chairman Amy Pascal and Oscar-winning producer Scott Rudin jokingly guess what President Obama's might be - suggesting films that feature black characters, like Django Unchained and 12 Years a Slave. They conclude: 'I bet he likes Kevin Hart.' After the emails emerged, they were reported to be 'racially insensitive' by multiple media outlets. On Thursday, Rhimes, 44, slammed this characterization. Speaking out: Shonda Rhimes, pictured, slammed a leaked email exchange between Sony's Co-Chairman Amy Pascal and producer Scott Rudin, who suggested Obama's favorite movies starred black characters . 'Calling Sony comments ""racially insensitive remarks"" instead of 'racist'?' she tweeted. 'U can put a cherry on a pile of s*** but it don't make it a sundae.' So far the hacked information has been humiliating for Sony Pictures Entertainment. A group called Guardians of Peace has taken responsibility and demanded that Sony stops its release of 'The Interview'. The movie, starring James Franco and Seth Rogan, lampoons North Korea. The premiere of the movie went ahead undisturbed in Los Angeles on Thursday night, but security was tight and there were no interviews held on the red carpet. In the leaked exchange that Rhimes called out, the two movie heavyweights discussed President Obama as Pascal sought his advice on what to speak to him about at a fundraiser. 'Would he like to finance some movies,' Rudin responded. Anger: On Thursday, she took to Twitter and slammed the media, who have referred to the remarks as 'racially insensitive', for failing to take a stronger stance against the email exchange . 'I doubt it. Should I ask him if he liked DJANGO?' Pascal asked. '12 YEARS,' Rudin responded. 'Or the butler. Or think like a man?' Pascal went on. 'Ride-along. I bet he likes Kevin Hart,' Rudin said. In another leaked email, Pascal also calls Angelina Jolie a 'minimally talented spoiled brat'. She has since issued an apology saying: 'The content of my emails were insensitive and inappropriate but are not an accurate reflection of who I am.' Rudin has also apologized for the comments. Furor: Scott Rudin, left, and Amy Pascal, right, suggested that President Obama might like '12 Years A Slave' of 'Django Unchained' in the email exchange. They concluded: 'I bet he likes Kevin Hart' 'I made a series of remarks that were meant only to be funny, but in the cold light of day, they are in fact thoughtless and insensitive - and not funny at all,' he said. 'To anybody I've offended, I'm profoundly and deeply sorry, and I regret and apologize for any injury they might have caused.' Rhimes was awarded the Sherry Lansing Leadership Award on Wednesday at the Hollywood Reporter's annual Women In Entertainment breakfast. In an awkward moment at the event, Angelina Jolie was seen glaring at Pascal, who called her a 'minimally talented spoiled brat' in one of the leaked emails, as the Sony exec tried to embrace her.","In the Sony leak, an email exchange showed Sony co-chair Amy Pascal and producer Scott Rudin guessing President Obama's favorite movies .

The exhibition that Máxima was in town to see is called The Secret of Dresden – From Rembrandt to Canaletto  and it officially opens on December 13th. The collections are considered to be one of the best-kept secrets in European art. They were assembled by the Prince-Electors of Saxony, including August the Strong and his son August III in the 1700s. Among the collection is art by some of the most prominent Dutch masters, including Rembrandt and Vermeer. The exhibition that Máxima was in town to see officially opens on December 13 . Máxima offset her dark suit and golden tan with a simple string of pearls, completing the look with a pair of pearl earrings . Máxima's visit came as her mother-in-law, Princess Beatrix of the Netherlands, travelled to Belgium for the funeral of the late Queen Fabiola. Fabiola's death appeared to be weighing on the royal's mind and was, perhaps, the reason for her sombre choice of ensemble, which was strikingly different from the cheerful brights she usually favours. Famous though she is for her style, Máxima is also loved for championing a huge range of charitable causes, with more added since  husband Willem-Alexander, 47, took the throne last year.

"It may look like a bit of dust on your screen, but this speck is in fact Ceres – a strange world that could reveal the origin of life on Earth. The image was taken when the Dawn spacecraft was around 740,000 miles (1.2 million km) from Ceres, on its way to meet the asteroid. Dawn will be captured into Ceres' orbit in March, marking the first visit to a dwarf planet by a spacecraft. Ceres is the bright spot in the centre of the image. Because the dwarf planet is much brighter than the stars in the background, the camera team selected a long exposure time to make the stars visible. The long exposure made Ceres appear overexposed, and exaggerated its size A cropped, magnified view of Ceres appears in the inset image at lower left . Ceres, the largest asteroid in the solar system, orbits the sun in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. 'Now, finally, we have a spacecraft on the verge of unveiling this mysterious, alien world,' Dawn mission director and chief engineer Marc Rayman, of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California said. 'Soon it will reveal myriad secrets Ceres has held since the dawn of the solar system.' The image was taken as part of a final calibration of the science camera before Dawn's arrival. On December 1, Ceres was about nine pixels in diameter - nearly perfect for this calibration. Dawn will be captured into Ceres' orbit in March, marking the first visit to a dwarf planet by a spacecraft (artist's impression pictured) Ceres is 590 miles (950 km) across and was discovered in 1801. In January, researchers discovered that water was gushing from its surface . Ceres is the closest dwarf planet to the sun and is located in the asteroid belt, making it the only dwarf planet in the inner solar system. Ceres is the smallest of the bodies currently classified as a 'dwarf planet'. Scientists think Ceres may have an ocean and possibly an atmosphere. It lies less than three times as far as Earth from the sun - close enough to feel the warmth of the star allowing ice to melt and reform. Nasa's Dawn spacecraft has been making its way to Ceres from the asteroid Vesta since September 2012. It is due to land next year. There is high interest in the mission because Ceres is one possible destination for human colonisation given its abundance of ice, water, and minerals. It provides data on very subtle optical properties of the camera that scientists will use when they analyse and interpret the details of some of the pictures returned from orbit. Ceres is the bright spot in the centre of the image. Because the dwarf planet is much brighter than the stars in the background, the camera used a long exposure time to make the stars visible. The long exposure made Ceres appear overexposed, and exaggerated its size; which was corrected by superimposing a shorter exposure of the dwarf planet in the centre of the image. Ceres is 590 miles (950 km) across and was discovered in 1801. In January, researchers discovered that water was gushing from its surface at a rate of 13lb (6kg) per second. Observations by the European Space Agency's Herschel telescope suggested they could be coming from geysers or ice volcanoes. Ceres orbits the sun in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and is very similar to Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus - both considered potential sources for harbouring life. Dr Michael Kuppers, of the Esa's lab in Villanueva de la Canada in Spain said: 'Although ground and space-based observations may further map the behaviour of Ceres over its orbit the Dawn spacecraft mission arriving to orbit Ceres in early 2015 is expected to be key in providing a long-term follow-up on the water outgassing behaviour of Ceres.' The presence and abundance of water in bodies like Ceres could have relevance for the origin of life on Earth and the large-scale migration of planets such as Jupiter. One scenario suggests as the giant planets migrated they disturbed populations of small rocky and icy asteroids and comets which hit the early Earth and Moon - delivering organic molecules and water to Earth. The image was taken as part of a final calibration of the science camera before Dawn's arrival. On December 1, Ceres was about nine pixels in diameter - nearly perfect for this calibration . Ceres is roughly the size of Texas and twice the size of Saturn's geyser-spouting moon Enceladus which is suspected of having liquid water beneath its surface. It lies less than three times as far as Earth from the sun - close enough to feel the warmth of the star allowing ice to melt and reform. Since launching in 2007, Dawn has already visited Vesta, a giant protoplanet currently located 104 million miles (168 million km) away from Ceres. The distance between Vesta and Ceres is greater than the distance between the Earth and the sun. During its 14 months in orbit around Vesta, the spacecraft delivered unprecedented scientific insights, including images of its cratered surface and important clues about its geological history. Vesta and Ceres are the two most massive bodies in the main asteroid belt.","The Ceres asteroid orbits the sun between Mars and Jupiter, and may have water gushing from its surface .

"It is a practice more usually associated with Far Eastern countries such as China and Vietnam. But a report by a newspaper in Switzerland has revealed that dog and cat meat is still part of meals in the Alpine nation. The Tages Anzeiger said farmers in the Appenzell and St. Gallen areas in particular slaughter the creatures to eat themselves or to pass on to friends. Canine snack: Eating dog meat is still common practice in some areas of Switzerland, a newspaper in the country has found . The favourite type of meat comes from a dog that is related to the beefy Rottweiler. ‘There’s nothing odd about it’, a farmer told the paper. ‘Meat is meat. Construction workers in particular like eating it.’ Another farmer told how he raised animals and then called in a butcher friend to kill them when they were ripe for slaughter. Still one more described how he either shot the creatures, usually adored as pets throughout Europe, or bludgeoned them to death. According to the report, people ate the meat as ‘mostbröckli’ - usually a form of beef or ham that is marinated, but this one made from dog or cat. ‘No-one knows what it is when you prepare it in this fashion,’ a farmer added. Dog's dinner: Although human consumption of dog meat is mostly associated with Asian countries such as China, pictured,  Swiss farmers confessed to breeding dogs for their meat . While not taking place on a commercial scale, the practice horrifies animal rights activists in Switzerland where the eating of such creatures is not forbidden by law, as it is in nearby Germany. In Switzerland the person who wants to kill a cat or a dog will only be prosecuted if the killing is itself cruel. Dog meat is eaten in a number of countries across the globe, but the practice is mostly associated with Asian nations. It is most common in China, South Korea and Vietnam where earing dog  is believed to bring good fortune . Koreans even have a special 'meat dog' breed called Nureongi which is bred for human consumption and very rarely kept as a pets. And the flesh cannot be sold commercially, even though some communities have pressed in the past for it to be sold on market days alongside the usual fare of beef, pork and lamb. The newspaper added; ‘The surveyed farmers spoke about their special preference only through the assurance of anonymity. All feared a hostile reaction from animal welfare activists and animal lovers. ‘Animal welfare organisations and farmers assess the consumption differently, but it is particularly popular in the Rhine Valley. 'One farmer said he had stopped eating it purely because it is “frowned upon” by society. He sees this as the hypocrisy of a society “that can get otherwise not enough meat.”’ There are no official figures about how many of these animals end up on the plates of the Swiss. The country also has a small but thriving trade in cat pelts for coats and bedspreads. The Swiss parliament rejected changing the laws to protect dogs and cats for human consumption back in 1993. Edith Zellweger of the Salez animal welfare group said; ‘How unscrupulous can a society be that man eats his best friend?’ She was behind the drive 20 years ago to get the law changed and will press for fresh legislation again. The Federal Veterinary Office said it was a ‘cultural matter’ and pointed out that in some countries dogs are reared specifically to be slaughtered and eaten.","Practice still common among farmers in areas of Switzerland .
The most popular type of dog is a breed related to the Rotweiler .

"A specialist unit is being set up by the British government to hunt down paedophiles who are using a hidden part of the internet known as the 'dark net' to share child pornography. The National Crime Agency and the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) will use the latest technology to crackdown on users of the so called dark net, or deep web. Prime minister David Cameron said the new unit is aimed at 'shining a light on the web’s darkest corners' as he announced a package of measures to tackle online child abuse. Scroll down for video . Dark net use in the UK has risen faster than in any other country in the world according to a recent report by the National Crime Agency and now a special unit is being established to crackdown on those using the sites . He said it had become necessary to target the dark net as paedophiles were increasingly using it to communicate with each other and to disguise their identities. The new unit will use new advances of analysing images and communications to trace the 'digital footprints' left by the users who share them. The dark net is a subsection of the deep web - the part of the internet that does not show up in searches or on social media. Most of the information on the web is far down on dynamically generated sites, unable to be found or seen by traditional search engines, which are rather like dragging a net across the surface of the sea, missing much of the information in the depths. The dark net is used as a way of sharing information and trading goods, but the anonymous and encrypted nature of it has attracted large amounts of illegal activity. The Silk Road website and its successor that were recently shut down was used to sell drugs in exchange for bitcoins, the electronic currency. Other dark net sites allow users to share pornographic photographs, hacked information, credit card numbers and other illegal goods. The Silk Road used an underground computer network known as the The Onion Router (TOR), which is a matrix of encrypted websites and servers that disguise the identity of users. It uses numerous layers of security and encryption, hiding the IP address and the activity of the user. Just 0.26 per cent of the daily internet traffic from the UK accesses this hidden part of the internet. The National Crime Agency estimates that around 20,000 people from the UK use secret or encrypted networks each day. The dark net consists of a network of encoded websites that sit behind the publicly available websites and cannot be found with normal search engines. It came to prominence in 2012 when the FBI made a series of raids on Silk Road, an online marketplace described as the 'eBay for illegal drugs'. Mr Cameron said: 'The so-called ""dark-net"" is increasingly used by paedophiles to view sickening images. 'I want them to hear loud and clear, we are shining a light on the web’s darkest corners; if you are thinking of offending there will be nowhere for you to hide. 'Every time someone chooses to view an online image or a video of a child being abused, they are choosing to participate in a horrific crime.' The new unit is intended to focus on the most prolific users of the dark net to begin with. Figures compiled by the National Crime Agency suggest that use of the dark net rose by two thirds in 2012. Hidden capabilities that enable users to email and host file storage through encrypted and anonymous networks are provided by services like the The Onion Router (TOR). TOR users currently represent 0.18 per cent of the total number of internet uses in the UK. However, in a recent investigation, GCHQ and the NCA were able to track down a British man who had been maintaining chat rooms and websites in the Far East and Eastern Europe that were used to share child pornography around the world. He was also offering advice to other paedophiles about how to hid their behaviour and was using software to keep himself anonymous. David Cameron unveiled the new unit to target the dark net at the #WeProtect Children Online summit . Analysis by experts at GCHQ allowed them to trace the man and he was later sentenced to three years in prison for making and distributing indecent images of children. Mr Cameron announced the establishment of the joint NCA and GCHQ unit at the #WeProtect Children Online summit in London, which brought together delegates from 50 countries and 26 technology firms to discuss how to tackle child abuse online. He unveiled new technical solutions that the internet industry will use to support the new special unit. Facebook, Microsoft, Google, Twitter and Yahoo will use the digital fingerprints, or hash values, of thousands of known child sex abuse image to prevent them from being viewed or shared. Technology companies and law enforcement agencies from 30 countries around world have agreed to work together to tackle online child abuse, which is to be supported by a £50 million child protection fund . Google has also developed new technology that allows child abuse videos to be identified and blocked and is to work with Yahoo to pilot it. Microsoft, Google and Mozilla have also said they will investigate ways of placing restrictions within their browsers to block people from accessing child pornography. Google and Microsoft have both also introduced a number of changes to their search functions not only the UK but across the world. Google claims to have seen a fivefold reduction in the number of searches for child abuse images since these changes were made. However, these changes are thought to be partly responsible for driving much of the trade in child pornography into the dark net.","GCHQ and National Crime Agency to use latest technology to track down dark net users who are sharing child pornography over secret networks .

After complaining bitterly about the terrible weather during Tuesday night's episode of Bravo's Watch What Happens Live, host Andy Cohen went off on an abrupt tangent that saw him slamming the indoor cycling studio. 'I hate SoulCycle. If I wanted a lesbian to yell at me I'd go to the Cubbyhole!' he declared, referring to a famous lesbian and gay bar in New York City. Scroll down for video . Haters: While talking about the weather on Tuesday night's episode of Bravo's Watch What Happens Live, Andy Cohen went on an abrupt tangent that saw him slamming popular indoor cycling studio SoulCycle . 'I hate SoulCycle!' The TV host launched a bitter tirade against the popular spin classes during his show . And his guest stars Sandra Bernhardt and Brandi Glanville chimed in, too. 'I wouldn't step foot in SoulCycle,' said Sandra, and Brandi agreed. 'We wouldn't step crotch [in a SoulCycle class, it hurts the kitty cat!' the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills exclaimed, gesturing between her legs. Andy, who once confessed that he was 'obsessed' with SoulCycle, was prompted to begin his diatribe after introducing his Jackhole of the day: 'white chicks' who push him out of the way on the subway when it's raining. Thanks to the inclement weather, New York's subway system has been particularly crowded recently - and Andy insists that women on their way to SoulCycle classes are the main source of the problem. 'I'm sorry I c**k-blocked your warm-up at SoulCycle, white ladies!' he joked. The studio audience cheered at his reference to the indoor cycling studio, suggesting they all felt the same way. Meow: Sandra Bernhardt (R) and Brandi Glanville (L) voiced their agreement with Brandi saying that the cycling classes 'hurt the kitty cat' Spitting with anger: Andy's furious rant about SoulCycle was prompted by his annoyance at the 'white chicks' who barge him out of the way on the subway . Viewers shared their reactions to the comment on Twitter, with one person writing: 'Andy just threw SO MUCH SHADE at soulcycle  #wwhl #hilarious'. Another fan wrote: 'SoulCycle haters unite,' and a third said: 'Best part of your Jackhole was you hating on SoulCycle!' The 46-year-old TV personality also bad-mouths the workout in his new book, The Andy Cohen Diaries. An excerpt reads: 'I met Mark Jason and Lauren at SoulCycle, which I hadn't done in a couple years because I always feel like if I wanted to be screamed at by lesbians, I’d go to the Cubbyhole. 'The same s*** coming out of the mouths of these SoulCycle instructors that made me go nuts years ago did again today - faux inspiration and ""depth"" spurted out with the passion of a McDonald’s drive-through operator,' he continues. 'I got depressed by the tribes of Lulu Lemmings in a place shallow enough to make this dime-store philosophy meaningful.' Devoted fans: Although SoulCycle boasts an impressive celebrity following, including the likes of Kaley Cuoco (L) and Kelly Ripa (R), it seems as though the workout's popularity may be dwindling . Wearing it on their sleeve: Jennifer Lawrence (L) and Olivia Wilde (R) have both attended SoulCycle classes in the past while wearing the brand's own line of workout gear . He does put a somewhat positive spin on the experience though, concluding it: 'That being said, I sweated out a bottle of tequila and almost puked twice, so I think the workout was a success.’ While Andy might not be a fan of the classes, they have built up an impressive celebrity following over the years. Several Victoria's Secret Angels, including Alessandra Ambrosio and Lily Aldridge, have credited the workout with helping them to maintain their supermodel figures, while Kelly Ripa, Kelly Holmes and even Lady Gaga have all previously sung their praises to SoulCycle, which launched in 2006 and charges $32 for a 45-minute group class. But while it has maintained its cult-like status for the past few years, it seems the reign of SoulCycle may be over. Indeed, these days many perceive it as a hobby of the 'Basic B****', as exemplified in a holiday gift guide published on Refinery29. Celebrity favorite: Despite Andy's feelings about the classes, they have managed to amass an impressive following from a wide variety of famous faces . 'By day, she's front row in her SoulCycle class. By night, she's swapping out her Liquiteria for margs on the rocks,' reads the article. 'And, by now, we've all heard about the ""Basic B****."" While some wholeheartedly embrace the term (bros included), others cringe at the thought of being a walking cliché.' And just last month, SoulCycle faced negative press when lawyer Douglas Wigdor claimed his membership to the studio had been revoked simply because he was representing a former instructor in a case. The lawsuit stated that SoulCycle's owners Julie Rice and Elizabeth Cutler barred both Mr Wigdor and his client from working out at the facilities just four days after he filed a federal wage theft claim.","Andy's guests, Sandra Bernhardt and Brandi Glanville, were quick to voice their agreement .
Ironically, the TV host has previously admitted to being 'obsessed' with SoulCycle classes ."
"Gwyneth Paltrow has expanded her Goop offering to include bras, yours for only $80 - but only if you have a rather small back girth. The 42-year-old actress' lifestyle website has launched two bras, both designed by New York-based start-up Negative Underwear, and they're only available in band sizes 32 and 34 - which tends to correspond with a U.S. 0-4 in dress size. The largest size available in terms of cup-size is a  32DD, and according to Goop's description, the bras - which are not returnable - 'can run slightly small.' Teeny: Gwyneth Paltrow's lifestyle portal Goop has launched two bras, both designed by New York-based start-up Negative Underwear, and they're only available in band sizes 32 and 34 (pictured) Vital statistics: Ms Paltrow, pictured earlier this year, is estimated to be between a 32-34B bra-size herself . In a new blog post titled 'The Perfect Bra', Goop readers are treated to a selection of 'beautiful lingerie that’s not so fancy you can’t wear it everyday, but prettier than granny panties.' The bras, priced between $37 and $240, are available to buy from a range of sources including Net-a-Porter and Journelle, but the only ones available to buy directly from Goop are the aforementioned Negative Underwear numbers. Ms Paltrow is estimated to be between a 32-34B bra-size herself. Fitting: The largest size available in terms of cup-size is a 32DD, and according to Goop's description, the bras - which are not returnable - 'can run slightly small' Struggling brand: Goop - which has been operating at a loss since its 2008 launch - is much derided for its extravagant style advice and product listings . The years have been kind to her! Ms Paltrow, pictured (left) in 2002 wearing an Alexander McQueen dress she later said she 'should have worn a bra with' and (right) last year in Los Angeles . 'We know that a bralette just isn’t a reality for those of us who are bustier,' the blog post astutely states, directing readers to their 'understated underwires.' The 'white essaouria demi' and the 'exclusive white albratross demi' are available in cup-sizes A through DD, and it's not that Goop has sold out of band sizes upwards of 34. Negative Underwear simply doesn't manufacture its bras any larger. 'We believe that less is more,' its own website reads. 'In a world of pushed up and overdone, we’re intentionally not.' What 32DD looks like: Katy Perry has declared herself a proud 32DD bra-size, so would just about fit into Goop's largest option . To be fair, the average American bra size is 34DD, according to a major study conducted by Intimacy last year. Still a little too large for Goop's new offering. But average has never really been Ms Paltrow's thing. Goop - which has been operating at a loss since its 2008 launch - is much derided for its extravagant style advice and product listings. Items on Ms Paltrow's Goop Christmas gift guide this year, for example, include a $4,800 gold-plated juicer and ‘bargains’ such as a $7,500 Cartier bracelet and baggage by Valentino for $4,500.","The 'Negative Underwear for Goop' bra comes in band sizes 32-34 and in cup-sizes A-DD .

"A 94-year-old former camp counselor and gym teacher who is charged with multiple sex crimes against children may have abused a staggering 100 youngsters, a new memo has suggested. William Bricker was arrested at his retirement community, the Tendercare Health and Rehab Center in Garfield Township, Wyoming, in September after allegedly abusing two boys and one girl. He was later charged with immoral and indecent acts with a child over the alleged sexual assaults, two of which reportedly occurred against two boys at Teton Valley Ranch Camp in 1962 and '85. The third apparent attack involved a 14-year-old girl who was reportedly kissed and fondled by Bricker during an overnight camping trip  at Grand Teton National Park in 1968. Former camp counselor: William Bricker (pictured in his police mugshot), 94, who is charged with multiple sex crimes against children, may have abused a staggering 100 youngsters, a new memo has suggested . After he was charged, Bricker's former employer, Winnetka District 36, released hundreds of pages of his personnel records, some indicating school officials knew of his alleged crimes decades ago. But now, a handwritten page dated  1995 - a decade after Bricker left his job at District 36's Hubbard Woods School - has been unearthed that suggests there may have been up to 100 victims. The memo, written during the tenure of then-Superintendent Rebecca van der Bogert, includes the shocking phrase: 'Could have 100 children abused', according to the Chicago Tribune. It also features references to the Cook County state's attorney and school lawyers, as well as phrases that apparently read: 'Letting sleeping dogs lie may be more helpful' and 'no proof'. Although the page appears to describe the Winnetka school district's reaction to the allegations made against Bricker, it remains unclear who wrote the memo, who it was written for, nor why it was written. 'We are not in a position to comment on or interpret documents prepared by others almost 20 years ago,'  district attorney, Michael Loizzi, told the newspaper. Scene: Bricker was arrested at his retirement community after allegedly abusing two boys and one girl. Two of the assaults reportedly occurred at Teton Valley Ranch Camp (pictured) in Wyoming 1962 and 1985 . But former school board member Judy Meyer, who was on the board when the memo was apparently penned, described the possibility of up to 100 child victims was upsetting. 'It's very unnerving to hear that,' she said, explaining that she was not previously aware of the page's existence. 'And to think he spent so many years (as a teacher). It is very disturbing.' Earlier this month, it was revealed that the state of Wyoming is seeking to have Bricker sent from Michigan to face the sexual assault charges against him. On December 4, a Northern Michigan judge ruled the pensioner - who was arrested on September 23 - must undergo a competency evaluation before any extradition hearing can be held. 'Could have 100 children abused' 'Letting sleeping dogs lie may be more helpful' 'No obligation to inform - Not in employ currently' 'Statute of limitations anyway' According to his attorney, Anders Gillis, Bricker is gravely ill; he apparently suffers from heart failure and uses an oxygen tank to breathe in home confinement at his hospice. 'We need to determine whether or not he is able to recall whether he was present in the state of Wyoming at the time of the alleged crimes,' Mr Gillis told The Associated Press. Meanwhile, Teton County sheriff's detective Dani Spence and county prosecutor Steve Weichman, citing state law, said they could not discuss the case or charges against Bricker. The charges stem from information investigators received in February about abuse at the Teton Valley Ranch Camp, according to an affidavit filed in Teton County Circuit Court. One former scout claimed he was molested aged 13 by Bricker in a bunk-style cabin at the camp in 1962, adding that he had initially brought the alleged assault up in the late 1960s. He thought he 'had communicated' to an assistant Boy Scouts leader at the time who he knew about the accusations and had been 'hurt', the affidavit said. The man, now aged 65, told investigators 'he never heard the Boy Scouts ... did anything about the accusation at that time,' it added. But Boy Scouts of America spokesman, Deron Smith, argued that the group was not aware of the allegations against Bricker until earlier this year. Hospice: According to Bricker's attorney, Anders Gillis, the pensioner suffers from heart failure and uses an oxygen tank to breathe in home confinement at the Tendercare Health and Rehab Center (pictured) 'While this individual was last involved in Scouting in 1988, when we received notice of alleged abuse this year we reported it to law enforcement officials in Wyoming and Illinois and have assisted them in their investigation,' Mr Smith said. He added that the organization has developed and enhanced its efforts to protect its young members in the decades since the alleged incidents took place. Last month, a woman also told investigators that she was kissed and fondled by Bricker during an overnight camping trip at Grand Teton National Park when she was just 14 years old. And last February, another former scout who spent five weeks at Teton Valley Ranch Camp in 1985 told police he was molested on at least six occasions by Bricker in the cabin he shared other boys. In October, the Winnetka school district released Bricker's personnel records following a police investigation, saying: 'We believe it is our responsibility to be forthcoming with the community.' A spokesman added: 'We want potential victims to know how seriously this School Board takes these issues.' However, attorney Marc Pearlman, who represents an alleged victim, questioned why the district seemingly did not do more to report claims against Bricker to authorities - even after his retirement. 'What's shocking is, even when a person is gone and no longer a present danger to the organization, it's very myopic thinking, because they could be harming other children somewhere else,' Mr Pearlman told the Tribune. Bricker worked as a physical education teacher at Hubbard Woods Elementary School in Winnetka, Illinois, a suburb north of Chicago, from 1949 to 1985. He also worked at Teton Valley Ranch Camp in Kelly, Wyoming, every summer until 2002, according to a lawyer for the camp. Earlier this year, the Teton Valley Ranch Camp Education Foundation board wrote in a letter to families and campers that the camp was under different owners at the time of the alleged abuse. The camp had operated in Kelly from 1939 to 2000, according to court documents. It was later sold and moved to Fremont County. 'We don't have a lot of additional information,' the letter read. 'What we do know is that, as an organization dedicated to the development and care of children, we seek and support justice for any person or persons who may have been harmed and lived with this for decades.' It is unknown whether Bricker has yet undergone the competency evaluation.","William Bricker arrested in September - decades after alleged assaults .

"It is the hardest thing about being on a diet - depriving yourself of your favourite foods. Now, one company claims to have come to the rescue - in the form of a low-calorie pizza. But before you get excited about carbs and cheese, bear in mind it's a meal replacement - made by adding water to a sachet of powdered dough and sauce. And while it's topped with vegetables, there is, sadly, no cheese. Scroll down for video . Slimline: The meal replacement pizza claims to have just 200 calories, thanks to a base made from vegetable protein and egg white that is topped with a tomato sauce . Tasty? The pizza are made by adding water to a sachet of powdered pizza dough and tomato sauce . The Exante pizza, it is claimed, has just 200 calories per eight-inch serving, compared with at least 500 calories in a regular thin crust base with tomato sauce. It is also said to be enriched with more than 22 vitamins and minerals plus added protein and is in line with recommendations of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). And the secret to it being just 200 calories? The dough is made from a vegetable protein and egg white and is topped with a tomato sauce containing soya and herbs. Eaten in its entirety as meal, it provides a third of the recommended daily amount of vitamins and minerals. While cheese wouldn't be recommended for dieters, other suitable toppings include green peppers, mushrooms, tomatoes, spinach, red onions - food low in carbs and calories. Chris Rogerson, managing director for the online weight-management company, Exante Diet, said sales in weight-loss meal replacements have rocketed in the last two years. 'Dieters want products that fit into their busy lifestyles,' he told MailOnline. Exante diet (per eight-inch pizza, dough and sauce) Calories 200 . Fat (g) 4.9 . Carbohydrates (g) 19.9 . Protein 17 .

'They also want to enjoy meals with their families and our new diet pizza allows them to stay on track with their weight loss without feeling deprived.' And unlike many meal replacement foods, it does actually resemble real food, he adds. But is a meal replacement pizza really the answer, regardless of what it may taste like? 'Meal replacements used to get a really bad press, but they do have a role to play,' dietitian Helen Bond told MailOnline. 'Most of them are required to have 200 - 400 calories by law and must contain an assortment of vitamins and minerals, added protein and fibre. 'Most people will lose weight if they cut down and will eat just 200 calories - and these meals are good for those who struggle with portion control.' But she fears any meal replacement paln may fails to educate slimmers in the long term - as they don't learn how to eat 'real food'. 'This means they may gain weight once they stop dieting,' she explains. 'On the plus side, the vegetable protein will be beneficial, and it will help dieters who feel they are missing out on ""proper"" food' - providing it tastes OK.'","The Exante Diet has launched the first ever meal-replacement pizza .

"Tony Blair, pictured, has refused to release 25 personal letters written to former US President George W Bush . A personal letter written by Tony Blair to George Bush backing his plan to wage war on Iraq has reportedly ‘gone missing’ from the official Presidential library – as pressure grows on the former Prime Minister to sanction the release of the private notes he wrote to Mr Bush. The letter, which is said to begin with the words: ‘You know, George, whatever you decide to do, I’m with you’, was last night described by a senior figure involved in the diplomatic negotiations at the time as ‘absolutely critical’ to the public’s understanding of the war – because it reveals the extent to which Mr Blair gave Mr Bush a ‘blank cheque’. Mr Blair’s refusal to authorise the publication of 25 personal letters and 130 official records of conversations with Mr Bush has led to a long delay in the publication of Sir John Chilcot’s official report into the war. Sir John held his last public hearings in 2011. On Friday, David Cameron made public his frustration, saying the report should be published by the end of the year. Mr Blair, backed by Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood – a key member of his inner circle during the build-up to the 2003 conflict – has argued that the sensitive documents should remain classified. But Mr Cameron has now effectively told Sir Jeremy to reach a compromise under which a ‘sensible’ proportion of the correspondence is released. The development comes as lawyers for the American government are deciding whether to release any of the documentation under US freedom of information laws. Since January – nine years after the conclusion of Bush’s first term in office – the letters have technically been available to researchers who ask for them, if they are cleared by a vetting committee of lawyers. But the lawyers have indicated to researchers based in the UK that the only correspondence they have not been able to find is the ‘I’m with you’ letter, sent by Mr Blair in July 2002, nine months before the outbreak of war. The letter, which was hand-delivered by Mr Blair’s foreign policy adviser Sir David Manning to US national security adviser Condoleezza Rice, has been referred to indirectly in political memoirs covering the period. When Mr Blair was questioned by the Chilcot Inquiry in 2011, he denied the specific wording of ‘I’m with you whatever’ – but admitted he thought it would have been ‘profoundly wrong’ not to honour commitments he had previously given to the US President. Mr Blair’s critics suspect he has been hoping to delay the Chilcot report – which is likely to prove personally damning as well as awkward for the Labour Party – until after next year’s General Election. Sources say the letters were ‘pretty much one way’ with Bush ‘failing to respond in a similarly personal manner’. A letter written by Tony Blair, left, to George W Bush, right, has gone missing from the Library of Congress . Last night, a British-based source involved in the effort to obtain the release of the letters told The Mail on Sunday: ‘The lawyers are taking months to evaluate the letters and decide whether to release them. ‘However, they claim not to have been able to locate the ‘‘with you whatever’’ letter.’ One senior figure involved in the 2002 negotiations between London and Washington told this newspaper: ‘There is absolutely no point in having this inquiry if the letters are kept secret. They are completely pivotal to our understanding. ‘And the ‘‘I’ll be with you’’ letter is the most critical of all – it gave the green light.’ Mr Blair’s office did not respond to requests for comment.","Tony Blair has so far refused to release letters written to George W Bush .

Alex Christmas proposed to his girlfriend Stephanie Sewhee on the foundations of their new-build home in Basingstoke . The couple had both secretly wanted to tie the knot however other ventures in their lives had kept both Stephanie and Alex preoccupied. They have been saving for three years to buy a home of their own, while living with Alex's parents in Tadley, Hants and Alex had wanted to wait until they had bought the house before popping the question. The couple had been visiting the grounds of their new build home in Basingstoke, Hants when Alex got down on one knee. Stephanie, now a ticket office agent at Reading Football Club, immediately said 'yes' and the couple celebrated with champagne. Stephanie, also 25 from Basingstoke, said that the proposal had come as a complete shock as she admitted that they had both been focused on moving home.
