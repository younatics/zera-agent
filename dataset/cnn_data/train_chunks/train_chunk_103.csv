"(CNN) -- Three Pakistan international cricketers have been banned from the sport for the next five years after being found guilty at an anti-corruption hearing on Saturday. Former Pakistan captain Salman Butt and bowlers Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir were found to have been involved in ""spot-fixing"" -- a practice involving illegal gambling during matches. Butt, 26, was banned for 10 years with half of that suspended on certain conditions while Asif, 28, received a seven-year ban with 24 months suspended. Amir, 18, was given a straight five-year penalty for his involvement in incidents during the Test series against England in August 2010. They have 21 days to appeal in the Court of Arbitration for Sport. The International Cricket Council announced the punishments following an independent tribunal's hearing in Qatar. It came a day after Britain's Crown Prosecution Service charged the trio and their agent Mazhar Majeed with conspiracy to obtain and accept corrupt payments, and conspiracy to cheat. Amir and Asif were accused of deliberately bowling no-balls -- deliveries which incur a scoring penalty and cannot dismiss batsmen -- to the instructions of Majeed, who received money from a third party, while Butt was said to be aware of the arrangement. The conditions of the reduced sentences require Butt and Asif to refrain from further breaches of the anti-corruption code and to participate in an education program run by the Pakistan Cricket Board. Pakistan trio to face criminal charges . The independent tribunal resumed its hearing on Saturday after adjourning on January 11. It dismissed a charge that Butt had agreed to bat out a run-less (or ""maiden"")over in the match played at London's Oval ground from August 18-21, but said the player failed to disclose to the ICC's anti-corruption unit that Majeed had approached him with such a request. The main charges stem from the following match at Lord's, the final Test of the series. ""The tribunal found that the charges under Article 2.1.1 of the Code that (respectively) Mr Asif agreed to bowl, and did bowl, a deliberate no-ball in the Lord's Test match played between Pakistan and England from 26 to 29 August 2010, Mr Amir agreed to bowl, and did bowl, two deliberate no-balls in the same Test, and Mr Butt was party to the bowling of those deliberate no-balls, were proved,"" it said in a statement on the ICC website on Saturday. Amir is the youngest bowler to claim 50 Test wickets, six of which came at Lord's as Pakistan lost to England by an innings and 225 runs. Butt has played in 33 Test matches since making his debut for Pakistan in 2003, and scored 1,889 runs. He became captain of the side in 2010 and led his country in a Test series against Australia as well as the tour of England before being replaced by Misbah-ul-Haq in the wake of the scandal. Asif has twice tested positive for steroids, resulting in year-long bans, and in 2008 was detained for three weeks after being found in possession of illegal substances at Dubai airport.","Former captain Salman Butt banned along with Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir .

"(CNN) -- In 1980, in the pre-Internet, pre-download days when R.E.M. formed in Athens, Georgia, there was no alternative. There was no Americana. There was no grunge. If you listened to pop music, there were essentially three divisions: Top 40 of the type you heard on the rapidly fading AM radio, the corporate rock of album-oriented FM and what was then called college radio -- a catch-all for the punk, new wave, electronic, low-fi and oddball music that almost never crossed over to the mainstream. R.E.M. helped to change all that. They weren't the only ones -- the New York art-punks of the late '70s, notably Talking Heads and Blondie, had hit the Top 40, and fellow Athens scenesters the B-52's had established a national following with their party-down rave-ups. But it was R.E.M. that, in the words of Allmusic.com's Stephen Thomas Erlewine, ""transformed the American underground."" If, in the '60s, teenagers gathered in their parents' garages in the hopes of being the next Beatles, in the '80s young adults knocked around dormitories in hopes of being the next R.E.M.: melodic, guitar-based and determined not to sell out to the corporate-music crowd. R.E.M. was the great hope of fame-fantasizing, used-record-store clerks everywhere. ""They did this grass-roots thing that nobody had ever done,"" said Angie Carlson, a former member of the band Let's Active, which toured with R.E.M. in the mid-'80s. ""They sort of bypassed big marketing, and were at the clubs networking with the cool fellow record-store people."" In R.E.M.'s wake came a breadth of artists who turned college radio into a home for guitar-based rock and power-pop: the Replacements, Jason and the Scorchers and the Del Fuegos, among many others. Years later, Nirvana emerged and the whole world broke open. Kurt Cobain, in fact, was a big R.E.M. fan. Now R.E.M. has come to an end. ""To our Fans and Friends: As R.E.M., and as lifelong friends and co-conspirators, we have decided to call it a day as a band,"" read a message posted on the group's website Wednesday. ""We walk away with a great sense of gratitude, of finality, and of astonishment at all we have accomplished. To anyone who ever felt touched by our music, our deepest thanks for listening."" The band didn't easily fit labels. Its early sound, led by Peter Buck's ringing guitar arpeggios, might best be described as folk-rock, equal parts Byrds-ian harmony and punk snarl. Alongside was lead singer Michael Stipe's reedy vocals and, more distinctively, his resonant, nonsensical lyrics, full of phrases such as ""Cages under cage"" and ""Hear the howl of the rope."" (Pre-Internet, a popular music-geek parlor game involved deciphering R.E.M. lyrics.) And underneath Buck and Stipe was the rock-solid rhythm section of bassist Mike Mills and drummer Bill Berry, filling spaces with melodic bass lines and powerhouse percussion. R.E.M. may have had its artsy flourishes, but the band also -- in ""American Bandstand"" parlance -- ""had a good beat you could dance to."" The band formed at a time when ""underground"" really meant something, said Carlson, now of Figure Eight Publicity. ""You couldn't trade (music) on the Internet. You had to know somebody or you had to go the club,"" she said. ""And that's the other reason a band like that was able to thrive -- people went to see live music. ""And they had such a cool vibe in person. They were smart, they were funny, they were charismatic. All of that played into it."" Moreover, the band worked hard, providing a model for others to follow. In the '80s, starting with the 1982 EP ""Chronic Town,"" there was a new record almost every year, each one followed by a never-ending tour of theaters and clubs. ""Nobody wanted to play the kinds of bars we played,"" Berry recalled in ""Party Out of Bounds,"" Rodger Lyle Brown's chronicle of the Athens music scene. ""Just by being an out-of-town band that played this new kind of music, we were stars."" They had a personal connection with their fans; after all, Buck was a record-store clerk once, too, and had a deep appreciation of music history. Decades on, they have maintained their ties to Athens. Their management office is still in town. With each album the band's sound grew deeper and wider, developing the basics on ""Murmur"" -- Rolling Stone's 1983 album of the year -- and ""Reckoning,"" exploring folk on ""Fables of the Reconstruction,"" and getting back to their roots in 1986's ""Lifes Rich Pageant."" R.E.M. finally broke through to mainstream success with 1987's ""Document,"" which contained the band's first Top 10 hit, ""The One I Love,"" as well as the radio favorite ""It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)."" ""Document"" changed things, for the band and its audience. With its success came a major-label deal with Warner Bros. and a change in venue from theaters to arenas. ""It's weird being a media figure, to be recognized everywhere by somebody,"" Stipe told Rolling Stone in 1992. The members of R.E.M. always seemed aware of their status and took pains to remain true to their muse. ""That would be my worst fear, that we would turn into one of those dumb bands who go into their second decade and don't know how bad they are and don't know when to give it up,"" Stipe told Rolling Stone. Despite the concerns of many fans -- who, as a 2003 Slate article observed, have been claiming the band's decline since 1984 -- the early-'90s albums included some of R.E.M.'s best work. ""Out of Time"" (1991) featured one of the band's best songs, ""Losing My Religion""; famed indie DJ Vin Scelsa was so taken with the song that he played it repeatedly during one radio show. Perhaps the best of the run -- and, to some, the band's best album, period -- was 1992's elegiac ""Automatic for the People,"" which hit all the right notes: somber (""Drive""), humorous (""The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonight""), angry (""Ignoreland"") and hopeful (""Everybody Hurts""). The band even managed to work in the F-word in ""Star Me Kitten,"" their knockoff of 10cc's ""I'm Not in Love."" But the rest of the '90s proved difficult. With the million-selling albums and gigantic tours, they risked becoming what fans had feared: a corporate behemoth. More dramatically, drummer Berry suffered a life-threatening brain aneurysm while on tour in 1995. He left the group in 1997, becoming a gentleman farmer in Watkinsville, Georgia, south of Athens. The band continued, but it wasn't the same. The albums, such as ""Up"" (1998) and ""Reveal"" (2001), were a mixed bag. ""Not as bad as it first sounds, but also not as good as they thought when they released it,"" critic Robert Christgau said of ""Reveal."" They toured, on and off. Buck hung out with pal Scott McCaughey's band, the Minus 5. The buzz moved on. Hopes were raised with the band's most recent release, ""Collapse Into Now."" ""Song for song, the best thing we've ever done,"" Buck told Rolling Stone earlier this year. ""We surprised ourselves with this record. We're all really thrilled with it,"" said Stipe in a June CNN interview. But the album was also the end of something -- the final record in their current Warner Bros. deal. It was time for the circle to close. ""We realized that these songs seemed to draw a natural line under the last 31 years of our working together,"" Stipe told CNN. Perhaps that's enough. ""You can talk to any band. They owe a debt to them, somehow,"" Carlson said. After all, as the band sang in ""Talk About the Passion,"" ""Not everyone can carry the weight of the world.""","R.E.M. helped lead the way for generation of American bands .

"(CNN) -- Four years ago, if someone said ""Robert Pattinson"" or ""Taylor Lautner"" to you, nine out of 10 people would have shrugged their shoulders and said ""Who?"" Now, they're pretty much among the most wanted and talked-about actors in Hollywood -- and it's all thanks to the whopping success of the ""Twilight"" franchise. And while the ""Breaking Dawn"" films will mark the end of that series, nearly everyone in the know has pegged ""The Hunger Games"" as the next ""Twilight."" So, take note of these names: Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth -- the next young megastars who will face the gift and curse of instant Hollywood fame. As the two male leads in ""Hunger,"" their careers will receive an instant injection of megawatt star power and credibility, they'll be remarkably wealthy and among the A-list ... but they'll also be scrutinized and trailed by the paparazzi and media everywhere they go. That's the trade-off these days, where any form of success or notoriety means everything in your life is now fair game -- chum in the water for the media sharks. Most actors and Hollywood stars gradually work their way up the ladder, but with the cult teen followings of ""Twilight"" and ""Hunger"" -- and both series' decisions to go with less-than-well-known names as the leads (save for Jennifer Lawrence in ""Games"") -- the transition from working actor to on-the-cover-of-everything can be a tough one to swallow. Thankfully for Hutcherson and Hemsworth, they have co-stars, girlfriends (Hemsworth has been dating Miley Cyrus on and off, and Hutcherson was linked to Vanessa Hudgens) friends and past co-workers who can help steer them through the blinding headlights of fame that are bearing down on them. Their ""Hunger"" co-star Lawrence experienced the same instant rise last year when she was nominated for an Oscar for her turn in ""Winter's Bone."" She went from relatively unknown actress to hot-new during awards season and will surely serve as a fame coach for her male counterparts. She recently opined on her methodology for avoiding the pitfalls of fame in a Washington Post interview, saying: ""As long as you remember what you're here for -- you're here for the work, you're here to make a film. ... There seems to be some very bizarre habit where as soon as you become big and famous, you think that you don't have to work anymore. And it's just such a weird trend that I'm starting to see. But I run into grounded people all the time. Given, most of them are behind the camera. But I definitely by no means think I'm the only one."" So with that mindset, what can Josh and Liam do to stay (relatively) grounded once they become the next big things? Here's a good checklist. 1. Choose wisely: This should apply to every aspect of your life, from who you surround yourself with and who you date, to what movies you are thinking of tackling. All of the minutiae of your life is now in full view, and a certain portion of the media loves nothing more than to exploit every misstep. Take a look to your left or right the next time you're in a business meeting or out with friends and ask yourself: ""Is this person here for me, or for their own benefit?"" 2. Stay (somewhat) private: We've already discussed the nosy media, but now with Twitter and other social media, celebrities can live out every action, thought and event in real time for all of the world to see. Sure, it's a great promotional vehicle, but it's one more trap that is 100% avoidable. Don't want your Twitter account hacked where someone posts nasty things in your name? Well, don't have a Twitter account. If you keep access to yourself somewhat limited, when you do actually have something to say, it makes it that much more powerful. Otherwise, people will get bored with hearing you tell them what you ate for lunch that day and miss the good stuff when you've got it. Plus, it adds a bit of mystery and allure to you. 3. Don't live in Los Angeles: Yes, it's where most movies are made and where all of your agents and associates are. Yes, it's got great weather, killer clubs/restaurants and all that. It also has a cannibalistic, frenzied media who pay their rent by looking to capture your lowest moments. Naturally, not having ""low moments"" is the more prudent option here, but keeping an apartment in L.A. for work trips and residing elsewhere ('Captain America' himself Chris Evans recently told us he couldn't take L.A. and moved back to his hometown of Boston) will surely minimize the paparazzi hassle. 4. Charity, charity, charity: You've struck it big -- now give back. Not only will it make you feel fulfilled (Josh has already been working with Straight But Not Narrow , a clever gay rights PSA), but it'll expose you to new audiences and groups who may not be drooling over ""Hunger Games."" 5. Don't be a jerk: If being well-adjusted and great acting travel at the speed of sound, news of being a difficult you-know-what whips through Hollywood at light speed. Agents, publicists, writers -- we all know each other, and we all talk about who's nice and who's a nightmare. Simply put: Just be nice.","Hutcherson and Hemsworth will see instant Hollywood fame after ""The Hunger Games""

"(CNN) -- A president's most solemn duty is to protect America and her people -- a responsibility that, in a time of evolving security threats and unsustainable debt, will only grow harder for the next administration. In the aftermath of the failure of the super committee, we are facing cuts in defense. Yet there has still been little discussion about overall defense spending priorities and how we must transform our defense infrastructure for the 21st century. Some of my opponents suggest maintaining the status quo, thus avoiding the tough decisions. Others advocate retrenchment and isolationism through draconian across-the-board cuts, which brings greater instability and risks. Still others revert to the oft-repeated pledge to eliminate waste, fraud and abuse from the Pentagon -- a worthy cause yet one of minimal consequence. Cutting wasteful spending alone amounts to only pennies on the dollar and leaves in place the same archaic defense infrastructure. These approaches miss the target in two respects. First, they let resources drive strategy, rather than using strategy to drive force structure and capabilities. Second, they fail to fundamentally alter our defense posture -- so any short-term savings will be quickly erased. In recognition of the growing asymmetrical threats we face and the evolving requirements of counterterrorism, we need a different set of capabilities. The world may have seen its last heavy armor battle between two nation-states. The relative importance of counterterrorism, intelligence, training and equipping foreign security forces, and special forces operations will continue to grow. Our forces must be designed appropriately. This means a greater focus on intelligence gathering and more agile special forces units, which can respond swiftly and firmly to terrorist threats in any corner of the globe. We must be prepared to respond to threats -- from al Qaeda and other terrorist cells -- that emanate from a much more diverse geography, including Yemen, the Horn of Africa, Pakistan and the Asia-Pacific region. We must also transform our orientation. By almost any objective measure -- population, economic power, military might, energy use -- the center of gravity of global human activity is moving toward the Asia-Pacific region. Embracing this reality may bring a dramatic change to the look of our military. The Asia-Pacific region is a maritime theater whereas Europe was mostly a land theater. For the U.S., the Asia-Pacific features a collection of bilateral military alliances in contrast to our involvement with the multilateral NATO in Europe. We are a Pacific nation living in a Pacific Century, and our vital interests in that region cannot be compromised. We can cut our base force and transition more responsibility for contingency operations to our National Guard and Reserve. In addition to being our most precious and valuable resource, our troops are also the most expensive part of our military. If we simultaneously transform our capabilities and posture while enhancing our Guard and Reserve, our active duty army could be reduced to around 450,000 troops, from the approximately 565,000 we now have. Our Department of Defense civilian work force can also be cut by 5% to 7% of its current size. At the same time, we should conduct a global posture review with the goal of closing at least 50 overseas military installations. The U.S. military maintains more than 700 installations outside the United States, the vast majority of which were opened during the Cold War. With a more mobile and flexible force, we simply don't need as many facilities overseas. We must risk American blood and treasure overseas only when there exists a vital national security interest. I have consistently called for our troops to return from Afghanistan as soon as possible. But I also believe President Barack Obama has been too quick to commit forces to other missions not core to our security interests. Within the same week of announcing a troop drawdown in Iraq, the president announced a deployment of a small number of combat forces to Africa -- an unnecessarily risky and costly mission. America alone cannot police the world. We should increase burden-sharing for the protection of the global commons among countries that share our values and security objectives. Unfortunately, we are not the only democracy stuck in a Cold War mentality. It is time for countries such as Japan and India to play a greater role in regional security matters. We must also throw out the old map and forge new security arrangements with regional partners such as Vietnam and Brazil. As we prepare to fight in the new battle spaces, we need to let go of old ""sacred cows."" Our military and defense establishment must be effective in the cybersphere, dominant in space and able to handle the increasingly lethal and accurate ballistic and cruise missiles being acquired by many of our potential foes. This will likely mean trade-offs away from heavy armor units, fighter air wings and aircraft carriers toward a more advanced cyberwarfare infrastructure, more capable unmanned aerial vehicles and more flexible sea-based assets. For America to remain a global force for good, we must maintain the world's most capable military. And being the best is not simply a function of spending the most. Staying on top will increasingly depend on our willingness to adapt to the realities of the 21st century security environment. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jon Huntsman.","Jon Huntsman: Presidents must place priority on protecting America .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Tears flowed from Dr. Conrad Murray's eyes Wednesday as he listened to an elderly patient tell jurors that Murray had opened a clinic in the Acres Homes community of Houston in honor of his father, who had practiced there. After 17 days of hearing about how pop star Michael Jackson died under Murray's care, jurors began hearing Wednesday from people who say the doctor saved lives. Ruby Mosley was one of five character witnesses called by Murray's defense lawyers Wednesday morning as his involuntary manslaughter trial nears an end. ""If this man had been greedy, he never would have come to an area, a community of Acres Homes, 75% of them poor, on welfare and Social Security,"" Mosley said. Murray continued to dab tears from his eyes even after Mosley left the stand. ""He's the best doctor I've ever been to,"" said Gerry Causey, a 68-year-old former patient of the man accused of causing Jackson's death.""And I just don't think he did what he's being accused of,"" Causey added, under cross-examination by the prosecution. Much of the prosecution's case has been spent trying to demonstrate that Murray gave reckless and incompetent medical treatment as Jackson's personal doctor in the last months of his life. Causey met Murray 11 years ago when he was rushed to a Las Vegas hospital with a heart attack, but they became friends since then, he testified. ""It's because of Dr. Murray, the way he cares for you, the way he makes you feel,"" Causey said. Prosecutors contend that Murray abandoned his patients in Las Vegas and Houston for the $150,000 a month Jackson had promised him. ""There's no way, he's not greedy,"" Causey said. ""He doesn't charge me my deductable, never has."" Las Vegas heart patient Andrew Guest, who followed Causey on the witness stand Wednesday, said Murray ""makes sure you're ok during the procedure."" ""That man sitting there is the best doctor I've ever seen,"" Guest testified. Murray treated Dennis Hix by putting 14 stints into arteries around his heart 11 years ago, Hix testified. ""I'm 66, I've gone to a lot of doctors, a lot of doctors and I've never had one that gave me the care that he did,"" Hix said. Murray never charged Hix beyond what his insurance would pay, he said. ""I had a type of insurance that don't hardly pay for nothing,"" he said. ""So he did it for me free."" Two medical experts for the defense, including anesthesiologist Dr. Paul White, are expected to follow Thursday and possibly Friday. This would set the stage for closing arguments and jury deliberations early next week, although it's possible that could come Friday. Jackson's sisters Janet and La Toya, as well as his brother Randy, were in court for Wednesday's testimony. The promoter of Jackson's ill-fated ""This Is It"" tour testified Tuesday that Jackson's fear that producers would ""pull the plug"" on the shows if the singer missed more rehearsals was unfounded. ""No one on our end was ever contemplating pulling the plug,"" said Randy Phillips, the head of AEG Live. Murray's lawyers contend Jackson self-administered the overdose of drugs that killed him in a ""desperate desire to get to sleep,"" because he feared without rest he would miss his next rehearsal and trigger the cancellation of his comeback concerts. If the tour was canceled, Jackson would have to pay for all of the production and rehearsal costs, Phillips said, although the judge would not let him tell jurors how much that might have been. Defense lawyer Ed Chernoff estimated the cost to be about $40 million, leaving him ""a very, very poor man,"" but it was not while the jury was present. Concert director Kenny Ortega sent Phillips an e-mail five days before Jackson's death, referring to Jackson's fear the company would cancel the tour. The e-mail triggered a meeting with Jackson and Murray to address Ortega's concerns about Jackson's ""lack of focus"" and missed rehearsals, with the debut of his London shows just three weeks away. He and Ortega were satisfied when Jackson told them ""You build the house and I will put on the door and paint it,"" suggesting he would be ready, Phillips testified. Also at the meeting, Phillips told Murray that he wanted to make sure Murray knew about Jackson's visits to another doctor, dermatologist Dr. Arnold Klein. ""Because he's his principal physician, I thought he should know,"" he said. Phillips said he was concerned because Jackson ""seemed a little distracted and not focused"" in a meeting after a visit to Klein's Beverly Hills clinic. The defense contends Jackson became addicted to the painkiller Demerol in his frequent visits to Klein in the three months before his death. His withdrawal from the Demerol, which Murray was unaware of, would explain why Jackson could not sleep the day he died, the defense contends. Earlier Tuesday, a nurse who tried to treat Jackson's insomnia with natural remedies testified that Jackson told her that doctors assured him using the surgical anesthetic propofol at home to induce sleep was safe as long as he was monitored. Jackson died two months after that conversation with nurse Cherilyn Lee, from what the coroner ruled was an overdose of propofol, combined with sedatives. Prosecutors contend Murray's use of propofol to treat Jackson's insomnia in his home was reckless, in part because he did not have proper equipment to monitor his patient and he abandoned him to make phone calls. Lee's testimony was briefly delayed as she was overcome with emotion. ""I'm feeling really, really dizzy,"" Lee said. ""This is just very sensitive to me."" Lee used IV drips loaded with vitamins, ""sophisticated"" vitamin smoothies and bedtime teas to treat Jackson's insomnia, but Jackson became frustrated when her natural remedies failed to make him sleep, she said. ""He said 'I'm telling you the only thing that's going to help me sleep right away is the Diprivan and can you find someone to help me to sleep?'"" Lee said. Diprivan is a brand name for propofol. After some quick research, the nurse warned Jackson that it was dangerous to use propofol at home, Lee testified. Jackson was not deterred, she said, even after she asked him ""but what if you don't wake up?"" Deputy District Attorney David Walgren asked her, ""And he responded, 'I will be OK, I only need someone to monitor me with the equipment while I sleep'?"" ""Yes, that's exactly what he said,"" Lee said. Murray had already agreed to serve as Jackson's private physician and had ordered his first supplies of propofol for Jackson more than a week before Jackson asked Lee for help getting the drug.","NEW: Dr. Murray sheds tears as heart patient testifies .

"(CNN) -- Former South African President Nelson Mandela toiled for 27 years in South African prisons before gaining his freedom and leading his nation from white minority rule to full democracy. In the process, he became an international symbol of strength and hope. Mandela became South Africa's first black president in 1984. This month he celebrates his 90th birthday with a lavish, star-studded concert in London that confirms his enduring status as a revered global icon. But his journey from young protester to political prisoner to leader of his nation has not been without heartache and personal loss. Mandela was born in 1918 in the South African village Qunu. He was the son of the chief councilor to a Thembu chief, and he soon became passionate about political reformation, founding the African National Congress Youth League in 1944 with lifelong friend Oliver Tambo. Mandela's natural leadership skills pushed him front and center during the ANC's 1952 Defiance Campaign, which urged South African citizens not to cooperate with certain laws deemed discriminatory. Mandela urged nonviolent solutions to the South African government's political, economic and social oppression of the nation's black majority. His commitment to nonviolent change was tested, however, in March of 1960 when black protestors in the township of Sharpeville were fired upon by South African police as they gathered to protest a law that required all black citizens to carry passbooks at all times. Sixty-nine people were killed and more than 180 were injured in the clash. The Sharpeville Massacre sparked riots, strikes and protest demonstrations across South Africa, and the government declared a state of emergency. But the massacre also highlighted the tragedy of apartheid to the rest of the world. The United Nations condemned the massacre, and its security council convened on April 1, 1960, to consider the ravaging effects of apartheid on South Africa's people. Inside the country, Mandela and his colleagues reconsidered the use of violence to further their cause for freedom. Mandela formed the revolutionary group Spear of the Nation In 1961 and was named its commander in chief. He slipped out of South Africa for military training in Algeria in 1962 but was arrested soon after he returned.  See pictures of Mandela's life » . Mandela had several previous run-ins with police, and he was eventually sentenced to life in prison for his actions protesting South Africa's apartheid government. At the time of his sentence Mandela made a dramatic statement that illustrated his overarching commitment to freedom: ""During my lifetime I have dedicated myself to the struggle of the African people,"" he said. ""I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination. I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But, if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.""  Listen to famous speech » . During his long incarceration, Mandela nearly became a myth. He smuggled out notes of encouragement to his followers that read like pronouncements. ""Any man or institution that tries to rob me of my dignity will lose,"" one note said. He might have been condemned to hard labor in a limestone quarry, but Mandela's unyielding moral stance held him high on a pedestal to his followers. In 1990, it became clear to then-South African President F.W. de Klerk that Mandela's release was necessary for the nation to heal. Mandela was 71 years old when he walked free from Victor Verster prison, his clenched fist held high. He'd lived a life of protest for a cause for which he'd been prepared to die. And now he would lead a nation on the brink of civil war to democracy. Three years later, de Klerk and Mandela would share the Nobel Peace Prize. ""The policy of reconciliation that Nelson R. Mandela and Frederik Willem de Klerk represent provides hope not only for South Africa; it is also a shining example for the world that there are ways out of the vicious circle of violence and bitterness,"" said Francis Sejersted, chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee as he awarded the shared prize. In 1994, Mandela was elected president in South Africa's first all-race general elections. Since his retirement in 1999, Mandela has turned his attention to international diplomacy: He convinced Libya to hand over two suspects for trial in the Lockerbie airplane bombing, and he played a role in the Burundi peace process. In 2005, he took up a personal cause closer to home. Mandela's son, Makgatho Mandela, 54, died of an AIDS-related illness. Nearly 5 million South Africans may have AIDS, medical experts estimate, and for many in the country discussing the disease is a taboo. ""Let us give publicity to HIV/AIDS and not hide it, because the only way to make it appear like a normal illness like TB, like cancer, is always to come out and to say somebody has died because of HIV/AIDS,"" Mandela said in January at a news conference where he announced his loss. ""And people will stop regarding it as something extraordinary."" On Mandela's 80th birthday he wed his 52-year-old companion, Graca Machel, from Mozambique at a private ceremony in his home in Johannesburg, South Africa. He danced at the double celebration surrounded by his grandchildren, family and close friends.","Mandela born in 1918 in the South African village Qunu .

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- Protesters and police clashed violently in front of the Greek parliament building Wednesday, as tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered in Athens on the first day of a two-day general strike over austerity measures. At least six protesters and 15 police officers were injured amid the disturbances, police said, and at least 15 people were arrested. Strikers in Greece aim to shut down wide sectors of the country, as lawmakers debate a new round of tough cost-cutting measures. Lawmakers passed the new austerity law in principal in an initial round of voting Wednesday, by 154 votes in favor to 141 against, with five lawmakers absent. Parliament must still vote on each article of the legislation Thursday before it can become law. ""Don't bow your head, it's time for resistance and struggle,"" marchers chanted in the capital earlier as they gathered for the union-backed demonstration. The violence broke out around lunchtime in one corner of the square, beside Parliament House, as a group of protesters dressed mostly in black threw rocks and Molotov cocktails at police. Officers fired tear gas and stun grenades, or ""flash bangs,"" in return, sending noisy detonations echoing round the square. Smoke filled the area by mid-afternoon as a fire burned in front of the finance ministry, forcing many peaceful demonstrators to move away. Police estimated that more than 70,000 people were protesting in Athens, and said they planned to put between 2,500 and 3,000 officers on the streets. Organizers estimated the turnout at 120,000 people. Initially, most of the protesters gathered peacefully in front of Parliament House waving union flags, red flags and banners. ""I'm here for my children and everyone else's children. Those punks in there have destroyed everyone's lives,"" said former railway worker Diamandis Goufas, 62, pointing at parliament. Greeks are angry at yet another round of planned austerity measures as Greece tries to bring down its stratospheric debt. Lawmakers are trying to cut government costs to reassure international backers it is doing enough to earn the bailout funds they have promised to pour into the country, with the latest austerity measures expected to pass Thursday. The new bill would lead to around 30,000 job losses and further cuts to wages and pensions for workers in the public sector. That has left at least some Greeks furious at the countries demanding that Greece bring down its spending. ""We are not lazy; it's the Germans, they want to take our blood,"" said Eleftherios Zarkados. At least one student said Wednesday that Thursday would not mark the end of the battle between politicians and the public. ""We will continue to resist even if the measures pass,"" said Sophia Titou, 21, a law student who works at an oil refinery. Many on the streets say they are angry that the well-off people they believe are benefiting from corruption and tax evasion are not being pursued, while public sector workers pay the price for Greece's woes. European Union leaders are scrambling to minimize the effect of Greece's debt on their common currency, the euro. Over the weekend, finance ministers from the world's largest economies pledged their commitment to take ""all necessary actions"" to stabilize markets. They aim to keep banks well capitalized so they can weather the effects of any defaults by Greece or other indebted countries like Portugal, Spain, Ireland or Italy. But there appears to be a split between France and Germany -- Europe's two largest economies -- on how to do it. Germany has stressed that individual European states should inject capital into domestic banks that lack sufficient buffers. But analysts say France is opposed to this idea because it could jeopardize the nation's top-tier credit rating. European leaders are expected to hear concrete details about how the plan might work at a European Council meeting Sunday. European Union heads of state are widely expected to finalize the plan in early November at a meeting of the Group of 20 world economic powers.

"(CNN) -- Arab League finance ministers recommended Saturday that economic sanctions be levied against the Syrian government for its part in a bloody, months-long crackdown on civilian demonstrators, a senior Arab League official told CNN. State-run Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) called the move an ""unprecedented procedure (that) contradicts the rules of the economic and trade cooperation among the Arab countries and targets the Syrian people."" Arab League foreign ministers from the regional alliance will meet at 11 a.m. Sunday in Cairo (4 a.m. ET) to consider whether to adopt the proposal, the league official said. Damascus had failed to respond to a Friday deadline for it to allow Arab League observers into the Middle Eastern country to monitor the government's response to civil unrest. ""The Syrians responded with more requests to amendments to the protocol; they did not reject or accept,"" a senior Arab League diplomat said. The slate of sanctions proposed Saturday in Cairo -- which were opposed by Algeria and Iraq -- include barring any private or commercial airlines from the league's 22 member states from flying into or out of Syria. In addition, all assets belonging to the Syrian government and its officials would be frozen so they couldn't be accessed, and Syrian officials would not be allowed to visit Arab League countries. Pictures on SANA's website on Saturday showed people packed in the city of Lattakia, reportedly to decry ""the Arab League decisions and foreign interference in the Syrian internal affairs."" Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu has said Syria risked international isolation if it continued along its present path -- adding that the reported violent crackdown on pro-democracy protests could not be tolerated. ""Syria has to make a decision,"" he said in Istanbul alongside his Italian counterpart, Giulio Terzi. ""It will either continue this crackdown policy against its people and become isolated more and more, or it will say yes to this well-intentioned Arab League proposal, sign this protocol and observers will monitor the situation on the ground by going to all Syrian cities."" Meanwhile, more violence was reported in Syria on Saturday, with the activist group Local Coordination Committees of Syria claiming that at least 29 civilians -- among them, four children -- had been killed. Twenty-two deaths occurred in Homs, as ""big military reinforcements"" equipped with eight troop carriers and four tanks allegedly reached the city. In addition, three were reported killed in Hama, two in Deir Ezzor, and one each in the Damascus suburbs of Kanaker and Idlib, said the group, which organizes and documents anti-government protests. State-run SANA, meanwhile, reported that 25 army and security force members were buried Saturday. ""The martyrs were killed in the line of duty by the armed terrorist groups in the governorates of Damascus Countryside, Homs and Hama,"" that report said. ""The families of the martyrs expressed pride in their son's martyrdom, ... stressing that Syria will remain steadfast in the face of the conspiracy which targets its unity and stability. They said that the Syrian people will overcome this ordeal through national unity, and that the blood of the martyrs will protect Syria and make it stronger in the face of challenges."" CNN cannot independently verify reports from either side, since Syria's government has limited access to international news organizations. Since March, protesters in cities across the country have been demanding President Bashar al-Assad's ouster and democratic elections. The United Nations estimated earlier this month that more than 3,500 Syrians have died in the subsequent government crackdown, said Ravina Shamdasani, a spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights. Al-Assad's government has consistently blamed armed gangs for the violence. Adding to the pressure on Damascus, the United Nations Committee Against Torture said Friday it is ""deeply concerned about gross and pervasive human rights violations in Syria,"" which are allegedly taking place ""in a context of impunity."" ""Of particular concern are reports referring to children who have suffered torture and mutilation while detained; as well as cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions; arbitrary detention by police forces and the military; and enforced and involuntary disappearances,"" said Claudio Grossman, who heads the expert panel. Reliable sources indicate the abuses ""are allegedly conducted under direct orders from public authorities, at their instigation or with their consent or acquiescence,"" Grossman said. The committee has asked Syria to provide a special report by early March indicating that it is abiding by its obligations under the U.N. Convention against Torture, to which Syria is a signatory.

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Conflicting accounts emerged Thursday over whether the extremist group Al-Shabaab has signaled a desire to negotiate with Kenya amid a Kenyan military offensive targeting the group. ""They want to talk,"" said a Kenyan official who did not want to be named because he is not authorized to talk to the media. A spokesman for the Kenyan government, however, disputed that account and said Kenya wouldn't talk with Al-Shabaab even if the group did want to negotiate. ""Al-Shabaab has not contacted Kenya in any way,"" said the spokesman, Alfred Mutua. ""There are no plans whatsoever for Kenya to negotiate with Al-Shabaab. Kenya does not negotiate with outlawed groups."" He said Kenyan troops have enjoyed success since crossing the border into Somalia to pursue Al-Shabaab, which the United States and several Western nations view as a terrorist organization. ""They are running scared. I think they are busy running for their lives,"" Mutua said. ""They don't have time to talk."" Kenyan troops struck several Al-Shabaab training sites in Somalia early Thursday, a military spokesman said. The militant group, which includes many rival factions with different leaders, operates from Somalia. The group's leaders were said to be reaching out for possible negotiations two weeks after Kenyan troops stormed into Somalia to hunt for Al-Shabaab, which Kenya blames for recent kidnappings of foreigners in the nation. But Sheikh Mukhtar Robow Ali, Al-Shabaab's second-in-command who is also known as Abu Mansur, told supporters protesting in Mogadishu against the Kenyan incursion that if Kenya struck targets in Somalia, the militant group would strike back. Kenya has said its forces aim to take the Somali port city of Kismayo, described by the United Nations as a key stronghold and source of cash for Al-Shabaab. The United Nations estimates the group collects up to $50 million a year from businesses in Kismayo, about half of its annual income. Robow urged what he said were Al-Shabaab-trained fighters in Kenya to take action in return, with the Kenyan port of Mombasa a target. ''Carry out attacks with heavy losses on Kenya,"" Robow said. ""If Kenya closes the sea port in Kismayo, attack its banks, its port, its foreign guests and wherever there is a high-value target."" Kenyan officials have declared self-defense justifies crossing the border with Somalia, saying a recent spate of abductions threatened its security and constituted an attack. Kidnappers have seized two aid workers and two European tourists in the past month. ""We have looked at what is going on ... and decided that unless we move in now, Al-Shabaab is not diminishing, it is becoming bigger and bigger,"" Mutua said. The war on terror cannot be won without dismantling the group's power, he said. Efforts to flush out the terror group will take a ""couple of months, if that,"" Mutua said, adding that ""weeks"" would be a more ideal time frame. Analysts and diplomats have raised concerns over the incursion, saying it gives the terror group a reason to strike Kenya. ""If there is anything we have learned in the last couple of decades is that foreign intervention, especially military intervention, doesn't work in Somalia,"" said Rashid Abdi, an analyst for International Crisis Group. ""I definitely understand Kenya's anxiety about the terror threat emanating from Somalia ... but I think there is more that Kenya could have done inside the country."" While noting Kenya's ""right to defend itself,"" the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi said it was not part of the decision to send troops to Somalia. ""The United States did not encourage the Kenyan government to act nor did Kenya seek our views,"" said Katya Thomas, the embassy's press officer. ""We note that Kenya has a right to defend itself against threats to its security and its citizens."" Somali President Sharif Ahmed thanked Kenya on Wednesday for helping battle the extremist group two days after he accused the nation of overstepping its boundaries.

"(CNN) -- More Occupy Wall Street protests were scheduled in New York on Thursday, a day after demonstrators marched to support an Iraq war veteran who was hurt in California. Hundreds packed the streets near Manhattan's Union Square on Wednesday in a march in support of veteran Scott Olsen. At least 10 people were arrested in clashes with officers, a New York police spokesman said. Olsen suffered a skull fracture Tuesday night after allegedly being struck by a tear gas canister in Oakland, California, according to witnesses. He was in fair condition Thursday in the intensive care unit at Highland Hospital, hospital spokesman Curt Olsen said. The former Marine has become another rallying cry for the Occupy Wall Street protests spreading throughout the country. Demonstrators have typically railed against what they describe as corporate greed, arrogance and power, as well as their assertion that the nation's wealthiest 1% hold inordinate sway over the remaining 99% of the population. The movement seems to be growing despite a recent crackdown in several cities. Authorities made a series of arrests at protests in Oakland and Atlanta on Tuesday and Wednesday. Police said they fired tear gas on protesters in Oakland after the crowd threw paint and other objects at officers. In Atlanta, police arrested dozens of demonstrators at a downtown park after they failed to leave the facility as ordered. In Nashville, Tennessee, authorities said Thursday that Occupy Nashville participants will be required to have permits, according to a statement from the state's Department of General Services.

"(CNN) -- The cat that vanished in baggage claim at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport and whose plight became an online sensation has been found after being missing for two months. ""American Airlines is happy to announce that Jack the Cat has been found safe and well at JFK airport,"" the carrier wrote in a post on the ""Jack the Cat is Lost in AA Baggage at JFK"" Facebook page Tuesday evening. ""Jack was found in the customs room and was immediately taken by team members to a local veterinarian. The vet has advised that Jack is doing well at present."" The airline plans to fly the cat to California to be reunited with his owner, Karen Pascoe. The saga started on August 25, when Pascoe was flying from New York to San Francisco with Jack and a second cat as part of a job relocation. But Jack escaped his kennel and was last seen at JFK's inbound baggage claim. (A Department of Transportation Pet Incident Report released earlier this month explains how it happened: A clerk placed one kennel on top of another on a baggage cart and the kennel on top fell. The impact ""caused the kennel to separate,"" allowing the cat to escape.) When a search failed to turn up Jack after a few days, Pascoe became frustrated with American Airlines and started the Facebook page ""to help us put pressure on AA to step up their efforts."" She also urged fliers to ""do whatever they can do to keep their animals out of cargo."" The page now has more than 16,000 followers. In its post, the airline said the search efforts included ""many employees at the airport who have remained vigilant in their search and committed to finding Jack."" While the cat was missing, workers placed food and water around the airport and set up humane traps. American even hired a pet detective and issued a pet Amber alert in hopes of locating the feline.

"Washington (CNN) -- In a change of policy, U.S. Marines are now allowed to wear bracelets in memory of fallen comrades. The metal or rubber bracelets can honor ""prisoners of war, missing in action, killed in action, and those who died of wounds or injuries sustained in a combat theater,"" the Marine Corps said in a statement Tuesday. Some Marines had been wearing the bracelets -- which list names of those killed in Afghanistan, Iraq or other zones -- despite their not being permitted by regulations. There had been questions about enforcement of the policy. The decision came out of a symposium last week at which the issue was discussed by the Marine commandant, Gen. James F. Amos, and his senior officers, the statement said. ""We are acknowledging the close personal nature of our 10 years at war and the strong bonds of fidelity that Marines have for one another, especially for those fellow Marines who we have lost,"" Amos said in the release. Amos on Monday met Marines who had returned to the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center at Twentynine Palms, California, from Afghanistan. He noticed bracelets and received ""positive feedback"" on the wearing of the them, said Maj. Stewart T. Upton, a Marine spokesman. About 360 members of the 3rd Battalion, 4th Marines, were welcomed home. They had five comrades killed during their seven-month deployment in Helmand Province, said center spokesman Capt. Nicholas Mannweiler. ""They are typically providing security,"" said Mannweiler. ""They made a lot of improvements."" The captain said the policy decision on the bracelets signified ""we get why you're wearing it and it's blessed."" Guidance on ""standardization and uniformity"" will be distributed to Marines by the end of next week, the Corps said. Marines had been permitted to wear the long-familiar POW/MIA bracelets since 1972, during the Vietnam War, Upton said.","Corps permits Marines to wear bands in honor of absent comrades .

"Ercis, Turkey (CNN) -- Nearly three days after a massive earthquake shook eastern Turkey, rescuers pulled two more survivors from collapsed buildings Wednesday. The quake and its aftermath killed at least 471 people and injured at least 1,650 others, the Turkish Disaster and Emergency Relief Agency said in a statement on its website. In the latest rescue, emergency crews pulled a 27-year-old teacher from debris 67 hours after the quake hit, the Turkish state news agency Anadolu reported. The teacher, Gozde Bahar, had difficulty breathing and was taken to a hospital for treatment. Eyup Erdem, 18, was pulled from a collapsed building where he had been trapped for almost 61 hours and was taken to a field hospital, the semi-official Anatolian news agency reported. No more information was immediately available on either of the rescues, which occurred in the town of Ercis in the province of Van. They came a day after crews pulled a baby, her mother and her grandmother alive from the rubble. The father of 2-week-old Azra Karaduman remained trapped beneath the rubble, officials said. Crews pulled four bodies from the debris after her rescue, but did not say whether they included the infant's father. Working in temperatures in the 40s (single digits Celsius), teams of rescuers have scoured the ruins for survivors since Sunday's 7.2-magnitude earthquake. In the town of Guvecli near the Syrian border, the last of the funerals were held Wednesday for the 15 people who died in the town of approximately 2,000 residents. Eighty percent of the 200 buildings were destroyed in the quake and the others were rendered uninhabitable, officials said. Residents were spending the nights crowded into tents, which were in short supply. Residents said aid was arriving sporadically. In Ankara, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan vowed that the eastern province would be rebuilt. He said 16 planes carrying search-and-rescue teams arrived in the region during the first two days after the earthquake and that 3,755 public personnel, 422 nongovernmental organization workers, 595 search-and-rescue vehicles and 860 health teams had been sent to the affected area. Turkey said Tuesday that it would accept international aid, citing a need for tents and prefabricated houses for ""the reconstruction phase"" that will begin after the search-and-rescue efforts, Anadolu said. Japan's embassy was the first to respond, promising to send about $400,000, Anadolu said. Japan suffered an earthquake and tsunami in March that killed thousands and triggered a nuclear crisis. Britain, Germany, France, Jordan, Qatar, Switzerland, Israel, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and the United States have also said they could help with reconstruction, the news agency said. Israel's Ministry of Defense said a plane carrying seven prefabricated buildings and other aid was to depart Wednesday for the stricken region. At least 2,262 buildings were demolished in Van and surrounding villages and towns, the news agency said. Relations between the two countries have been tense since last year's Israeli commando raid on a Gaza-bound flotilla laden with humanitarian aid. Nine Turkish activists were killed. Turkey has suffered other major earthquakes in recent years. A magnitude-7.6 earthquake in Izmit killed more than 17,000 people in 1999, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. A magnitude-7.2 tremor in Duzce the same year killed 894 people, the agency reported. CNN's Diana Magnay contributed to this story .","A woman, 27, and a man, 18, are pulled from the debris .

"Paris (CNN) -- The former head of the International Monetary Fund, arrested on sexual assault charges and then released after his accuser's credibility was questioned, acknowledged ""moral weakness"" in an interview Sunday but denied any violence or aggression. Dominique Strauss-Kahn told French television station TF1 the incident at the Sofitel involving a Guinean maid was ""not only an inappropriate relationship, but more than that -- an error, a mistake, a mistake concerning my wife, my children, my friends, but also a mistake that the French people placed their hope in change on me."" ""There was a weakness,"" he said. ""It was greater than a weakness, it was a moral weakness, a moral mistake, and I'm not proud of this. I regret this. I've regretted it throughout these days, through these four months, and I believe I've not finished regretting. ""I had a feeling I was trapped, humiliated,"" he said of the accusations. He said he was deeply wounded by the images and the media reports surrounding the allegations. He spoke of being hounded by reporters and scrambling to find a place to stay that would satisfy court security requirements. ""This was expensive,"" he said, but ""... either that or return back to (jail)."" Once considered a front-runner candidate for the French presidency, Strauss-Kahn, 62, was pulled off a Paris-bound plane on May 14 and arrested after the sexual assault allegations. Days later, he resigned from the IMF and was put on house arrest after spending a few days in New York's Rikers Island jail. But questions arose about the credibility of the maid, identified as Nafissatou Diallo, prompting prosecutors to drop the charges against Strauss-Kahn. He returned to France earlier this month. Prosecutors pointed out that there was ""neither material proof nor any credible evidence"" that an assault took place, Strauss-Kahn told the station. And a prosecution report said there were no signs of violence to the woman, he said. Authorities said the woman told differing versions of the story, Strauss-Kahn said. ""If there was the slightest accusation that remained, there would have been a trial."" Strauss-Kahn's attorneys have previously said the two were involved in consensual sex. Diallo's attorneys have filed a civil lawsuit against Strauss-Kahn. Asked Sunday whether he and his attorneys will negotiate with her, Strauss-Kahn said they would not. ""I've always had respect for women,"" he said. ""... I've paid heavily. I'm still paying for this."" Douglas Wigdor, one of Diallo's attorneys, said he looks forward to asking Strauss-Kahn questions under oath, and hearing his responses. ""We have still not heard what Mr. Strauss-Kahn has said happened in that room. ... We're waiting for that. We had hoped that this would happen today, but it didn't,"" he told CNN's Don Lemon after the interview. ""If Mr. Strauss-Kahn thinks that people in France will really believe that he was able to convince Ms. Diallo, who had never met him before and did not know that he was in the room, to engage in sexual acts with him within a matter of minutes, then he should describe how that happened,"" Wigdor and Kenneth Thompson, the woman's attorneys, said in a statement released before the interview Sunday. ""We suspect that he will not do so because any story that he describes will not be plausible."" They noted the French journalist who interviewed Strauss-Kahn is a friend of his wife's. ""As everyone knows, Ms. Diallo sat down with unbiased journalists and investigative reporters who were permitted, without any conditions, to ask questions about Ms. Diallo and the deplorable acts that Mr. Strauss-Kahn committed against her,"" the statement said. Strauss-Kahn told the station that his wife, French journalist Anne Sinclair, is ""an exceptional woman ... I'm so lucky to have her by my side. I have hurt her. I know this. I begrudge myself, but you know, she would not have been like this, she would not have supported me, if she had not known from the first second that I was innocent."" He said he wanted to be a candidate in the 2012 French presidential elections. ""I wanted to be useful and bring answers, and that is all behind me,"" he said. ""Quite clearly, I cannot be a candidate, even if I've continued to think about it ... I do not wish to be in the primaries."" French journalist Tristane Banon has filed a complaint against Strauss-Kahn in France, alleging he attempted to sexually assault her in 2003. He has filed a counter-suit alleging slander. Asked about Banon's allegations Sunday, Strauss-Kahn said he met with her recently and ""I said the truth to her in this meeting. There was no act of aggression, there was no violence. ... The version that was presented was imaginary."" CNN's Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","The former IMF head acknowledges ""moral weakness""

"(Rolling Stone) -- One of the most stunning moments in Cameron Crowe's new Pearl Jam documentary comes near the end, when the band plays ""Better Man"" at Madison Square Garden and the audience euphorically screams along to every word. The soundtrack to the film -- which contains that ""Better Man"" -- is for those hardcore fans. There's no ""Jeremy,"" ""Daughter"" or ""Even Flow"" here. But there is a gorgeous demo of ""Nothing as It Seems"" from 1999, a demo of the 1990 Temple of the Dog track ""Say Hello 2 Heaven"" and an early version of ""Alive,"" from Pearl Jam's second show, in December 1990. The emotional high point may be ""Crown of Thorns,"" from a gig in 2000. The song was first cut by Mother Love Bone shortly before their frontman Andrew Wood died; the group recruited Vedder and changed its name to Pearl Jam.

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- A series of deadly bombings claimed more than a dozen lives in Iraq Saturday, according to police and health officials. Seven people were killed and 28 others wounded when three roadside bombs exploded mid-morning in the busy Bab al-Sharji commercial district of central Baghdad, police officials said. Another six men died and 10 others were injured when a roadside bomb hit a minibus carrying young laborers and construction workers in al-Annaz area in eastern Falluja, health and police officials said. The blast occurred at about 5.30 a.m. local time in what is a predominately Sunni area. ""The victims were traveling every day in a minibus from Abu Ghraib to Falluja to work in a number of reconstruction sites,"" police officer Ahmed Salman told CNN. Meanwhile, the Iraqi army held a military parade in Falluja, sending hundreds of Iraqi soldiers accompanied by military vehicles through the main streets of the town Saturday morning, police told CNN. The military parade was part of preparations for the Iraqi army to take over full responsibility for security after U.S. troops leave Iraq on December 31 this year. Violence in Iraq has declined from its peak, but attacks around the country continue to cause deaths and injury. On Thursday, 19 people were killed and dozens others were hurt when three explosions hit a commercial district in Basra, an oil-rich, predominantly Shiite city about 500 kilometers (310 miles) south of Baghdad.","Three roadside bombs went off in a commercial district of Baghdad, police said .

"(CNN) -- In 2009, a freshly elected U.S. president who campaigned on the themes of hope and change appointed a veteran negotiator to take a crack at the Israel-Palestinian conflict. Now, 32 months after President Barack Obama named former Sen. George Mitchell as his chief Middle East envoy, the peace process is stalled and the United States faces the diplomatically dangerous possibility of having to veto a United Nations Security Council resolution on Palestinian statehood. How did it get to this point? The answers are in the intractable nature of the conflict, political pressures faced by the Israeli and Palestinian leaderships, and a steady waning of U.S. influence in the region, exacerbated by the Arab Spring protests that erupted last December. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said Monday he intends to submit an application for statehood to the Security Council, according to U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky, setting up a possible vote as soon as Friday. U.S. officials have made clear they will veto it, affirming the longstanding backing for Israel, the nation's strongest Middle East ally. Meanwhile, behind-the-scenes negotiations are seeking to avoid a move certain to evoke Arab protests of American bias and even hypocrisy. A U.S. veto would amount to Washington blocking an outcome it has publicly supported -- the creation of a Palestinian state next to Israel. However, the Obama administration insists that result must occur through a negotiated deal with Israel. ""We continue to believe and are pressing the point that the only way to a two-state solution, which is what we support and want to see happen, is through negotiations,"" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said late Monday. Addressing the possible Palestinian statehood bid, she added that ""no matter what does or doesn't happen, this will not produce the kind of outcome that everyone is hoping for, so we are going to stay very much engaged and focused."" Also Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was willing to meet with Abbas in New York to launch direct talks that would continue back in the Middle East after the U.N. General Assembly. Netanyahu's offer was an obvious attempt to give Abbas a plausible reason to put off the statehood bid, an outcome desired by the United States. ""For President Obama, who came into office speaking about self-determination and promised the Palestinians that it's a new day and a new dawn for them, to go to the Security Council and cast a veto against the Palestinian state is politically problematic,"" Fouad Ajami, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institute think tank, said Monday on CNN. ""It's really a catastrophe for him in the Arab world, but he has no choice but to pass the veto if it came to that,"" Ajami continued. ""The hope is (that) between now and Friday, some exit, some other formula will be found to spare one and all in this confrontation at the Security Council."" Fran Townsend, a CNN contributor on national security issues, said the potential U.N. vote ""puts the United States in a very awkward position."" ""It is a veto that will most certainly undermine U.S. credibility as an honest broker in the peace process,"" at least in the eyes of the Arab world, Townsend said. The latest developments come five months after Mitchell's resignation. He said he only signed up to tackle the world's toughest diplomatic job for two years, but he was clearly frustrated by the inability to restart direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. Mitchell, who was 77 when he stepped down, traveled back and forth in the region trying to overcome the decades of hostility and mistrust that bedeviled the peace process. Face-to-face negotiations sought by the United States and its mediating partners from the United Nations, European Union and Russia never materialized. The Obama administration came into office hoping to seduce the Middle East with a more sensitive and compassionate posture after eight years of the Bush administration that brought war in Iraq and tough posturing against Iran and other enemies of Israel. In June 2009, Obama used a high-profile speech in Cairo, Egypt, on relations between the United States and the Muslim world to address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He reaffirmed the U.S. endorsement of a two-state solution and urged compromise and understanding between ""two peoples with legitimate aspirations."" Addressing two main issues in the dispute, Obama said the U.S. government ""does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements"" in the West Bank, and declared that ""it is time for (settlement construction) to stop."" He also called America's bond with Israel ""unbreakable"" and said Palestinian violence such as rocket and mortar attacks on Israel must cease. In particular, Obama said the Hamas movement -- which controls Gaza -- must end violence and recognize past agreements. Less than a year later, any perception of progress began to shatter. Not only did Obama fail to make good on his Cairo pledges, but his inability to rein in Israel on settlement-building was evidence of how hard jump-starting negotiations would be. In March 2010, Israel announced a new settlement project in East Jerusalem, maintaining its insistence that the entire city would always be part of its territory. After years of lukewarm reactions to such statements about new settlements by Israel, the United States chose to push the envelope, turning the incident into a crisis that further hindered the peace process when Netanyahu would not give in. Then came the Gaza flotilla raid on May 31, 2010, when Israeli commandos stormed a Turkish ship leading an effort to break Israel's blockade of the Palestinian territory. The incident, in which nine Turks were killed, cast a harsh spotlight on the grave humanitarian situation in Gaza and led to a breakdown in relations between Israel and Turkey, one of its few allies in the region. Against that backdrop, the Arab Spring of pro-democracy uprisings that started in Tunisia and spread to Egypt, Libya, Syria, Bahrain and other states became an uncontrolled factor in the Middle East equation. Hesitant U.S. support for protesters, first in Egypt, then in Libya and now in Syria, raised questions in the region about the clarity and commitment of the Obama administration's policy. In a speech in May, Obama expressed support for pro-democracy aspirations in the Middle East. He also offered specifics on a possible Israel-Palestinian agreement based on pre-1967 borders and including land swaps to reflect current realities on the ground. The pre-1967 borders refer to Israel's territory before the six-day war that year in which it took control of the Gaza Strip, West Bank, East Jerusalem and other territory from neighboring countries. Both sides found reason to reject Obama's proposal as a basis for resuming peace talks, and now the successful Arab Spring protests have given Abbas new impetus to challenge Israel and the United States by seeking statehood through the United Nations. Former U.S. President Bill Clinton said Sunday that the Palestinians were making the U.N. bid out of frustration. ""They have reinforced cooperation with the Israelis,"" Clinton told the NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""They have produced a growing economy on the West Bank. They have renounced violence. And all the Arab countries except Syria have offered Israel a political, military and security partnership for the future, including opposition to Iran's nuclear design, if they create a Palestinian state."" And yet, Clinton noted, ""there's been no progress."" One reason for a lack of progress has been uncertainty over the status of a Palestinian unity effort involving the Abbas-led authority in the West Bank and Hamas, which rules Gaza. Israel and the United States consider Hamas a terrorist group and refuse to negotiate with it. The United States also has called on Hamas to renounce violence and recognize Israel's right to exist in order to take part in the peace process. Hamas does not support President Abbas' bid for statehood. Hamas leader Ismail Haniya has said Fatah does not have the right to sacrifice Palestinian rights, including making concessions on Palestinian land or the right of return for Palestinian refugees. He said Hamas will not recognize Israel's right to a Jewish state. Townsend said the changing face of the Middle East is worrying to Israel, noting the Muslim Brotherhood strengthening in post-Mubarak Egypt, the possibility of anti-Israel factions gaining a role in post-Gadhafi Libya and the constant threat from Iran. ""So you can understand Israel's concern about their current security,"" Townsend said. ""I think Israel is rightly concerned. This is a very dangerous time.""","U.S. backs an independent Palestinian state through negotiations .

"(CNN) -- The Obama administration vastly underestimated the tens of thousands of barrels of oil pouring into the Gulf of Mexico after the Deepwater Horizon disaster, despite contrary information from scientists using better methodologies, a report from a national panel investigating the response said Wednesday. And, the report said, the White House Office of Management and Budget squelched higher worst-case estimates once government officials accepted them, preventing the public from hearing them. The staff also sharply criticized later White House estimates that 75 percent of the oil had been scooped up, burned or naturally dispersed, saying an operational tool -- known as the oil budget -- used by responders failed to accurately account for biodegradation and was not peer-reviewed by scientists. The working paper from the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling looked at the government's response to the April 20 explosion that triggered the spill, and whether it accurately and appropriately conveyed information to the public. The explosion claimed 11 lives and led to thousands of barrels of oil being spewed into the Gulf daily for almost three months. ""By initially underestimating the amount of oil flow and then, at the end of the summer, appearing to underestimate the amount of oil remaining in the Gulf, the federal government created the impression that it was either not fully competent to handle the spill or not fully candid with the American people about the scope of the problem,"" said Wednesday's report. Federal officials have stated that the low flow-rate estimates did not negatively affect their operations to stop the oil spill. ""Even if responders are correct, however, loss of the public's trust during a disaster is not an incidental public relations problem,"" the 29-page report said. ""The absence of trust fuels public fears, and those fears in turn can cause major harm, whether because the public loses confidence in the federal government's assurances that beaches or seafood are safe, or because the government's lack of credibility makes it harder to build relationships ... that are necessary for effective response actions."" The report issued Wednesday is considered a working paper. The commission will issue a formal report January 12, 2011. The president appointed the commission in June and tasked it to provide recommendations on how to prevent future spills and mitigate the impact of any that do occur. The commission is headed by former Florida governor and former U.S. Sen. Bob Graham and former Environmental Protection Agency administrator William K. Reilly. Government officials, reacting to the report, said the response was ""in full force and immediate"" and that the government adequately warned the public of worst-case spill scenarios. Rep. Edward Markey, D-Massachusetts, chairman of the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, said BP won't be able to escape liability. ""Low balling the flow rate numbers was BP's attempt to hide both the truth and their wallet from the American people,"" Markey said. After the oil rig sank, the U.S. Coast Guard and BP initially put the spill at 1,000 barrels per day. The administration later derived a 5,000-barrels-per-day estimate, depending on an ""unsolicited, one-page document"" based on visual operation of the speed at which the oil was leaking from the end of the riser at the bottom of the Gulf. Despite ""inaccuracies"" in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientist's estimate of 5,000 barrels, the government stuck with that number through May 27, despite estimates from outside experts suggesting a much higher figure, the report said. The panel's staff wrote that in some cases, nongovernment scientists relied on more refined or better-established methodologies. ""It is possible that the early official flow estimates would have been more accurate if the government had either enlisted greater in-house scientific expertise, or enlisted outside scientific expertise by making available the data on which government estimates were based,"" the report said. ""The government appears to have taken an overly casual approach to the calculation and release of the 5,000 barrels a day estimate -- which as the only official estimate for most of May, took on great importance,"" the report said. Soon after the spill, the Minerals Management Service and BP reported a worst-case estimate of 162,000 barrels, but that was replaced by another estimate received by the Coast Guard and NOAA of 64,000 to 110,000 barrels per day. The actual figure turned out to be about 62,000 barrels per day. A barrel of oil is equivalent to 42 gallons (159 liters). According to the report, NOAA wanted to make public some of its worst-case models and requested approval from the Office of Management and Budget. That request was denied. A member of the government team assembled to address the gulf between official and independent flow-rate estimates told CNN, ""We were never pressured [by the government] that we should change our [flow rate] number."" Ira Leifer blamed the initially low oil flow-rate estimates on the poor quality of data the group of scientists had from BP. Better video and data led to the rise in the daily oil spill estimate, he said. The report also faulted the government's tracking of the spill. It said a White House official in August claimed 75 percent of the oil was ""gone."" But the response team could not support that claim, panel staffers wrote. That information was never meant ""to be a precise tool,"" and the administration should not have used it as a scientific report, they said. ""It did not attempt to quantify biodegradation, or the exact amounts of remaining, dissolved, and dispersed oil, which were not the targets of response action."" Further, it said, the government's failure to account for the stages of biodegradation increased public confusion of how much oil was actually ""gone."" The federal government later Wednesday said it acted appropriately with regard to spill estimates and the clean-up. ""As for the predictions about the spill flow rate, senior government officials were clear with the public what the worst-case flow rate could be: in early May, [Interior] Secretary [Ken] Salazar and Admiral Thad Allen told the American people [in media interviews] that the worst case scenario could be more than 100,000 barrels a day,"" said a statement from OMB Acting Director Jeffrey Zients and NOAA Administrator Jane Lubchenco. ""The federal government response was full force and immediate, and the response focused on state and local plans and evolved when needed,"" the statement continued. ""As directed by the President, the response was based on science, even when that pitted us against BP or state and local officials, and the response pushed BP every step of the way. Finally, and most importantly, the response provided results for the people of the Gulf Coast."" Regarding the flow and recovery of the spilled oil, Zients and Lubchenco said responders worked with best known information at the time and later came up with improved analysis. ""The facts bear out that the federal response significantly mitigated the impact of the spill,"" they said.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- After approximately a week of poring over 145 jury questionnaires, lawyers in the trial of Michael Jackson's doctor are due in court Wednesday to discuss removing jurors whose answers they believe should disqualify them from hearing the case. But legal experts say prosecutors and defense attorneys in the Conrad Murray trial will be doing more than simply screening jurors based on their answers to the more than 100 questions filled out on September 8 and 9. They'll also be scrutinizing what prospective jurors may have said outside the courthouse and online about events surrounding the June 2009 death of pop star Michael Jackson. ""This is the world of social media, and it directly impacts criminal trials,"" said Thomas Mesereau, the attorney who successfully defended Jackson during his 2005 molestation trial. ""I have no doubt that both sides will hire competent people to explore every aspect of social media to try and find out whatever they can about these jurors, and also to see if these potential jurors have communicated themselves with anyone else about this case."" The questionnaire asks whether potential jurors ""ever posted any blogs or posted comments on any internet sites"" and goes on to specifically ask whether the individual ""accessed or posted"" any comments about Murray, who is accused of administering a lethal dose of drugs to Jackson. ""I think it is safe to say that contemporary trial practice dictates that you make an effort to find out whatever information you can about jurors,"" Los Angeles defense attorney Shepard Kopp said. ""If somebody has a Facebook page where the settings are public, and you can see what their interests are, you can very well learn valuable information there."" A simple Internet search can link attorneys to prospective jurors' blogs, tweets and postings on social networking sites to see if they have commented on a specific case. It also may offer insight into jurors' psyches. ""Any information you can get on a prospective juror is helpful, because you have such a short period of time in which to evaluate who the person is that is ultimately going to be making a very important decision in the case,"" said Richard Gabriel, a jury consultant with Decision Analysis. Gabriel has been advising attorneys for 25 years on such high-profile murder cases as O.J. Simpson's and Casey Anthony's. He says screening jurors today is easier because of the amount of information people share on the Internet. ""If they have a Twitter account, it can give you a little bit more about how they interact with the rest of the world, not just in a courtroom setting,"" he said. But Gabriel added that it is rare for a legal team to have time to do such vetting of prospective jurors, because jury selection is completed within hours in a vast majority of trials, not over several weeks as in the Anthony case (and most likely Murray's as well). ""The last thing you want to be doing in jury selection is research on your laptop computer in court,"" Kopp, the attorney, said about finding time to vet jurors. ""That can send the message to the jurors that you are engaged in some other kind of work and you are not interested enough in the case you are trying."" And who knows what the reaction might be if jurors knew they were the ones being judged online -- to determine if they were fit to sit in judgment. Opening statements for the trial, which will be televised, are scheduled for September 27. The trial is expected to last about a month. If convicted of the involuntary manslaughter charge, Murray could face up to four years in prison.","Attorneys are due in court Wednesday to discuss Conrad Murray case jury selection .

"(AOL Autos) -- Consumer Reports recently announced its annual used cars ratings, and we weren't surprised to see one of the major categories was ""Best in Fuel Economy."" With gasoline and oil prices on a seemingly endless upward spiral, that's a key factor these days when choosing a used car -- or even a new one. The cars that made this list were, according to Consumer Reports, ""the affordable and reliable vehicles [that] returned some of the best results in our real-world fuel-economy tests."" What follows is a list of the vehicles that magazine rated ""Best in Fuel Economy"" in the under $10,000 price range, with a short description of each vehicle. The mileage figures stated are the ones calculated by Consumer Reports in their own on-the-road tests. 2000 Honda Insight  Overall MPG: 51 . When the Insight hit showrooms in 1999 for the 2000 model year, it was hailed as one of the cleanest and most fuel-efficient vehicles in the world. It was the first gasoline-electric hybrid to be sold in the U.S., and won several design, engineering and technology awards. The Insight employs Honda's Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) system, combining an extremely lightweight 1.0-liter, three-cylinder gasoline automobile engine with an ultra-thin electric motor. Early models came with a 5-speed manual transmission, but a continuously variable transmission (CVT) was offered starting in '01. 2001 - 2002 Toyota Prius  Overall MPG: 41 . This was one of the earliest generations of the fuel-sipping Prius, and it certainly has become a green living icon since then. Drawing its power from a combination of a 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine and an electric motor, these earlier editions generated only 70 hp, but muscle isn't the point in a hybrid car. It's pod-like design had a certain retro-futuristic appeal, and was roomier than one might think. 2000 - 2005 Toyota Echo  Overall MPG: 38 . The Echo was rolled out in 2000 as a no-frills compact econo-box, for those who wanted Toyota quality but were on a budget that precluded them from snagging a Corolla. The interior is plain, but the engine is reliable and efficient, and the taut suspension delivers a ride comparable to larger models. This version of the Echo comes with a 1.5-liter four-cylinder 108-hp 16-Valve EFI engine. 1998 - 2002 Chevrolet Prizm  Overall MPG: 32 . The Prizm of this era bore some resemblance to the Corolla, since both were built on the same assembly line in a joint GM/Toyota plant. A front-wheel-drive subcompact sedan, the Prizm was initially rolled out under the Geo nameplate, but later became a Chevy model. Available as a base model and LSi, the Prizm is powered by single twin-cam four-cylinder engines that produced 120 hp in 1998 and 1999, but the addition of VVT in 2000 boosted the ponies to 125. 1998 Mazda Protégé LX  Overall MPG: 32 . Mazda redesigned the Protégé in 1995, upgrading it considerably with a more rigid chassis and much-improved ride quality -- not to mention increased interior space. This edition also offers a silkier ride, crisp handling and solid performance for a small car. This model year has a 92-hp 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine, and comes in three trim levels. 1998 - 2000 Toyota Corolla CE/LE  Overall MPG: 32/31 . The Corolla has been a stalwart for more than 40 years, for its quality, dependability and, maybe most importantly, for its fuel economy. The 1998-1999 editions are powered by a 1.8 L, 120-hp, four-cylinder 16-Valve EFI, with aluminum alloy block and head. By 2000, they'd tweaked the engine to deliver 125 ponies. A front-wheel drive job, the Corollas of this period come in three trim levels, but Consumer Reports chose the midline CE and top-end LE. 1998 - 2001 Acura Integra LS  Overall MPG: 32 . The Acura Integra sport coupe and sport sedan lineups have always been standard-bearers for innovative technology, craftsmanship, and exhilarating performance. It was the top-selling automobile in its segment from 1994 - 1998. It is available on five sport-coupe trim levels and three sport- sedan trims. The Intergra LS came with a 1.8-liter, 140-hp engine, automatic transmission is optional. 2004 - 2005 Scion xA  Overall MPG: 31/30 . The Scion xA's body lines are rounder and more sculpted than the distinctly boxy shape of its xB cousin, but it's just as well-constructed and just as comfy inside. Low maintenance costs are a big selling point, as is the taut ride. A 1.5-liter, 108-hp 16-valve four-cylinder comes standard on the 2004 - 2005, along with a five-speed manual transmission, and an automatic transmission was optional.","The 2000 Honda Insight was the first gasoline-electric hybrid sold in the U.S.

"(CNN) -- The applause that erupted during last week's NBC/Politico debate among Republican presidential hopefuls at the mention of the executions carried out during Rick Perry's tenure as Texas's governor cut off co-moderator Brian Williams' question in midstream. Williams: Gov. Perry, a question about Texas. Your state has executed 234 death row inmates, more than any other governor in modern times. Have you . . . [SUSTAINED APPLAUSE] . . . . Have you struggled to sleep at night with the idea that any one of those might have been innocent? The response presumably would have been more muted if Williams had been allowed to finish his question. Most people are less enthusiastic about the death penalty's being applied against the innocent. Following the question's completion, Governor Perry volunteered that he has ""never struggled with that at all,"" explaining that ""when someone commits the most heinous of crimes against our citizens, they get a fair hearing ..."" Had the governor an opportunity to rephrase his answer, he likely would have clarified that fair hearings also are available to those who have been charged with but did not actually commit a heinous crime, and that such crimes might occasionally involve noncitizen victims as well. But the point is not to quibble about word choices; Texas governors can be forgiven linguistic mistakes if they allow no capital ones to happen. Troy Davis, scheduled to be executed next week in Georgia for the murder of off-duty police officer Mark MacPhail, could be a capital error that is about to happen. Davis was convicted and sentenced to death more than 20 years ago by a jury that heard testimony from at least nine witnesses who implicated him in the killing. Since then, seven of the trial witnesses have recanted or revised their testimony so that it no longer points to Davis' guilt. Of the two witnesses who have not revised their condemning trial testimony, one is believed by Davis' supporters to have been the actual murderer. The last judge to review the case concluded that Davis' conviction and death sentence should not be disturbed, leaving the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles, which has previously declined to take action, as the last apparent barrier to Davis' execution. With no DNA or comparably reliable scientific evidence available to help confirm or contraindicate Davis' guilt, the cry to achieve a final resolution of the case appears poised to trump the trial's lingering uncertainties. Davis may or may not be innocent. To acknowledge this much would suggest that he should not be executed. Yet Georgia is ready to move forward. If it is true that justice delayed is justice denied, it must also be true that an injustice not delayed is justice denied. (In another case, yesterday The U.S. Supreme Court delayed the scheduled execution of an inmate on death row in Texas after questions arose about a psychologist who had testified that blacks and Hispanics were more likely to commit future crimes.) To make these observations about the cheering that greeted Perry's execution record and the angst accompanying Troy Davis' scheduled execution is to dwell on symptoms at the expense of their origins and deeper meaning. I want to believe, and I do believe, that few of those celebrating at the mention of the Texas executions would not shed their festive enthusiasm and become reflective, sober, perhaps even somber if enlisted as witnesses to the execution of a fellow human being, even one indisputably guilty of committing murder. I believe that those who cheer are applauding not the ugly reality of death inflicted by lethal injection but rather what it is that the punishment of death symbolizes: the triumph of law over criminal violence, of good over evil, the emphatic denunciation of unspeakably immoral misconduct, the restoration of order and a salve against the fear created in murder's wake. The reality of the death penalty is that even if it is politically popular (to wit, the Perry applause) it is an ineffective criminal justice policy, rarely employed, unevenly distributed and fraught with the potential for error. Its mistakes, unlike those committed in cases resulting in imprisonment, cannot be corrected. Capital punishment is infinitely more soothing and reassuring as an abstract symbol of justice than it is in practice. Being under penalty of death is likely to be Troy Davis' best reason to harbor hope for salvation. If he is innocent, he should not be in prison, let alone facing execution. Little focuses our attention as much as the prospect of an innocent person being put to death. If Davis were not confronting execution, but instead had been convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment without parole by his trial jury, the simple truth is that he would be just another nameless, faceless prisoner among the thousands upon thousands who have been convicted of crimes and incarcerated notwithstanding colorable claims of innocence. Don't get me wrong. If Troy Davis is innocent, if there are real doubts about his guilt, then doing something, anything, to spare him from execution is of the highest order of importance. But if wrongful convictions occur in cases that result in the death penalty, as they undoubtedly do, then they occur exponentially more often and for all of the same reasons in the untold number of cases not resulting in the death penalty -- ones that are met with a collective yawn or shrug of the shoulders by policymakers who are in a position to make meaningful systemic reforms. Odd as it may be, the existence of capital punishment represents the most hopeful stimulus for procedural and substantive changes necessary to prevent and correct the injustices worked by wrongful convictions in criminal cases throughout the land. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James R. Acker.","James Acker: Debate question to Rick Perry about Texas' many executions drew cheers .
He says most people, though, are cheering triumph of justice, don't want wrongful executions .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- An Afghan political figure considered vital to peace efforts in the country was assassinated Tuesday, officials said. Burhanuddin Rabbani, a former Afghan president who had been leading the Afghan peace council, was killed in an attack at his home. NATO's International Security Assistance Force said two suicide bombers, ""feigning a desire to conduct reconciliation talks, detonated themselves."" Afghan officials earlier said there was one bomber. The attacker hid the explosive device inside his turban, said Hasmat Stanikzai, spokesman for Kabul police. An Afghan intelligence source told CNN that the bomber arrived at the house at the same time a meeting was due to take place between Rabbani and a delegation representing the Taliban insurgency. Stanikzai said the bomber claimed to be a Taliban member who had come for the talks about peace and reconciliation, and detonated the explosives as he entered the home. Four other people were wounded, including Masoom Stanikzai, a key adviser to Rabbani, the police spokesman said. A doctor at a 400-bed hospital in Kabul said, ""We have received three people from the blast at Rabbani's house. Among the injured are Masoom Stanikzai, one bodyguard and an assistant"" to Rabbani. Rabbani was long considered crucial to Afghan and coalition efforts to bring Taliban leaders into the reconciliation process. He was also heading the United National Front Party, the largest political party that stands in opposition to President Hamid Karzai. Karzai called Rabbani's killing a ""very tragic loss"" for his country. Speaking at the United Nations in New York, Karzai described Rabbani as ""an Afghan patriot"" who ""has sacrificed his life for the sake of Afghanistan and for the peace of our country."" ""We will miss him very much,"" Karzai said. Karzai cut short his time at the United Nations. His office said he would return to Afghanistan in the wake of the killing. Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, said of the violence in Afghanistan, including Rabbani's assassination, ""We know that is the campaign the insurgents are on. We've got to adjust to that and protect the leaders. ""Someone is going to have to step in very quickly because that is a critical part of the peace process,"" Mullen said of Rabbani's role. The killing represents the strategy of the Taliban to assassinate as many leaders as possible, Mullen said. NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen called the assassination ""an attack on the Afghan people as they begin to take their country's security in their own hands."" ""To those who offer only death and destruction to the Afghan people, our message is clear: You will not prevail,"" he said in a statement. Gen. John R. Allen, commander of ISAF, said the ""face of the peace initiative has been attacked."" ""This is another outrageous indicator that, regardless of what Taliban leadership outside the country say, they do not want peace, but rather war,"" Allen said in a statement. The loud explosion heard in the attack on the home prompted temporary lockdowns at the nearby U.S. Embassy and ISAF headquarters as officials investigated the source of the blast. Personnel at the U.S. Embassy were instructed to take cover late Tuesday afternoon due to an incident outside the embassy's perimeter, an embassy spokesman said. ""It appears at this time that the embassy was not the target of the incident,"" spokesman Gavin Sundwall said in a statement. ""We are working to account for all embassy personnel and staff."" ISAF headquarters was on lockdown for about 30 minutes, an ISAF spokesman said. People at the headquarters heard a couple of deep booms followed by sirens, the spokesman said.","NEW: ISAF commander says the face of the peace initiative has been attacked .

"Jelena Jankovic is making a reputation for herself as one of the hardest working women in tennis. Grin and bear it: Jelena Jankovic hopes 2009 will be the year she wins a Grand Slam tournament. Only a few others on the women's tour competed in as many matches as her last year, and her consistency, blistering forehand and an improved all-round game saw her end 2008 as the world No. 1. She prepared for the Australian Open -- under way in Melbourne -- in the punishing heat of Mexico and hopes that winning her first Grand Slam tournament under the harsh Melbourne sun will silence the critics who have questioned her right to the No. 1 spot without having won a Grand Slam title. ""I don't understand why so many questions are being asked about that. I mean it's not the end of the world. I just play my tennis and I enjoy every match. I go on the court with a smile and that's all that matters to me. And if it will happen it will happen,"" she told CNN before the Australian Open. While sounding somewhat fatalistic about her chances at the first Grand Slam of 2009, it belies a determination that has propelled the upbeat 23-year-old Serbian from an early childhood in Belgrade to the top of women's tennis and a jet-setting lifestyle. She moved from her native Serbia to Florida when she was just 12 years-old, training at the Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy -- the same tennis camp that honed the skills of Maria Sharapova and the Williams sisters. Being away from her family from such a young age made her grow up quickly, she says: ""I think I matured much faster than some of the girls my age and made me much stronger as well."" Life as an international tennis professional also means life on the road, and Jankovic admits that sometimes it can be tough. ""For me the most difficult thing is being away from my family and friends, away from my country. Sometimes I just wish I was a normal girl, just staying at home and living a normal life,"" she told CNN. But her desire to be the best in the world and determination to succeed is galvanized by the achievements of her fellow Serbian tennis stars on the tour, Novak Djokovic and Ana Ivanovic. ""We are strong individuals and we come from a background where we didn't really have facilities to train, or the best financial status. We made it with our will and with our determination,"" she said. ""I'm proud that we have gone a long way and we have achieved huge things coming out of a small country. And I hope that will inspire and motivate the younger generation and help them by building a tennis center so that they can train in Serbia, develop their games and not have to go abroad like we had to do in order to become champions. ""It's amazing. In Serbia people are following that sport and waking up at three in the morning to watch us play,"" she said. If she can dispatch the opposition in Melbourne with the same composure and determination she's shown in other tournaments she could finally have a title to match her ambition and give her compatriots something to really celebrate in the wee hours of the morning.","Serbian tennis star is world number one; looking to win first Grand Slam tournament .

"United Nations (CNN) -- Confronted with the prospect of a Palestinian bid for full U.N. membership, U.S. President Barack Obama issued a sharp rebuke Wednesday to those pressing for statehood -- a rebuke likely to bring criticism from the Arab world. ""Peace will not come through statements and resolutions at the U.N.,"" Obama said, addressing delegates at the 66th annual session of U.N. General Assembly. ""If it were that easy, it would have been accomplished by now."" The United States has vowed to block a Palestinian membership application should it reach the Security Council, but is likely eager to head off a scenario that would involve an American veto -- a move widely seen as unpopular across the Middle East. A formal request for full U.N. membership is expected to be submitted Friday. ""One year ago, I stood at this podium and called for an independent Palestine,"" Obama added. ""I believed then -- and I believe now -- that the Palestinian people deserve a state of their own. But what I also said is that genuine peace can only be realized between Israelis and Palestinians themselves."" A year later, despite extensive U.S. efforts, ""the parties have not bridged their differences,"" Obama said. The American president met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and declared the bonds between their two countries ""unbreakable,"" a move likely to play well at home in an increasingly volatile U.S. political landscape. Though Netanyahu was not in attendance at the General Assembly during Obama's speech, he called the U.S. position a ""badge of honor,"" and has pushed for a resumption of talks, beginning in New York and continuing in Ramallah and Jerusalem. Peace negotiations broke down last year. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas met with Obama later Wednesday, part of a whirlwind of diplomatic wrangling that has accompanied his proposed move. Obama reiterated his stance on the need for a two-state solution, officials said. Abbas met earlier with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who promised the request would be taken ""very seriously,"" according to Nabeel Shaath, a senior negotiator for the Palestine Liberation Organization. Shaath told CNN it had not been decided if the formal application would be submitted the U.N. secretary-general before or after Abbas addresses the General Assembly early Friday afternoon. Ban said it will ""not take long"" to get Security Council consideration. Shaath added that settling for a lesser status -- such as being recognized as a non-member state -- is one option under consideration if the push for full membership is blocked. But the Palestinians do not want ""anybody to suspect a lack of seriousness,"" he said. Palestinians' current status at the United Nations is as an observer ""entity."" Observers can speak in the General Assembly but not vote. While a veto by the United States in the Security Council would block any effort to gain full U.N. membership, a ""yes"" vote in the General Assembly -- where only a majority would be needed -- would raise Palestinians to the status of permanent observer ""state,"" the status the Vatican currently holds. Abbas' effort to gain U.N. recognition of a Palestinian state is opposed by Hamas, the Palestinian organization that controls Gaza. It has warned Abbas against making the request, saying it would show a willingness to acknowledge and negotiate with Israel, which would ""deprive the Palestinian people from their right to come back to their homeland."" As national leaders took to rostrum Wednesday to spell out their visions for global peace and security, attention at the U.N. General Assembly seemed to center on the potential membership bid. French President Nicolas Sarkozy urged the body to recognize Palestine as a non-member state, calling for a more definitive timetable for Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. But he also warned that a U.S. veto of the bid for full membership in the Security Council could be dangerous and might spark violence. Argentinean President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner seemed to agree, adding that ""non-inclusion of Palestine (at the United Nations) this year will create greater insecurity."" The Palestinian leader said he will personally deliver the application to the U.N. Security Council, but does not expect the body to act immediately, according to Palestinian officials. They say Abbas is expected to deliver the letter before he leaves New York on Friday, but added that he will give both the United Nations and American leadership several weeks to respond to the letter -- temporarily averting a diplomatic showdown. Abbas will wait for a response from the diplomatic Quartet on the Middle East, the officials said, and then return to the U.N. General Assembly to negotiate statehood recognition, working through the U.N. Security Council. Abbas' goal, according to the officials, is to legitimize Palestinian statehood by eventually forcing a vote. Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, who kicked off the opening round of speeches at the assembly's 66th session, joined the chorus of voices on Wednesday calling on the council to approve the Palestinian bid. Her speech marked the first time a woman has commenced the annual proceeding, reflecting a moment of equality at the start of what she described as ""the century of women."" Also Wednesday, Obama pressed Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan --- an increasingly vocal critic of Israel -- to continue work toward patching up their strained relationship, officials said. The U.N. chief, meanwhile, also focused on a series of other issues highlighted during the annual session, particularly the spread of noncommunicable diseases, empowering women, food security and climate change. ""Saving our planet, lifting people out of poverty, advancing economic growth -- these are one and the same fight,"" said Ban. ""Today, I call on you to reach a binding climate change agreement -- an agreement with more ambitious national and global emissions targets."" Thirty-one of the world body's 193 delegates are expected to address the assembly this week. Brazil has traditionally opened the session since the days of former American president Harry Truman, when the U.N. was in its infancy. It was founded in 1945 after World War II.

"(CNN) -- The worldwide burgeoning of obesity and diabetes, including in developing nations, is causing increasing alarm. This week, the United Nations is bringing attention to these and other noncommunicable diseases at the General Assembly meeting in New York on the prevention of noncommunicable diseases. But global funding shortfalls, the reality that obesity and diabetes affect the rich and middle class more than other socioeconomic groups and the absence of a proactive civil society will create few incentives for politicians in developing nations to take U.N. resolutions seriously. According to the World Health Organization, worldwide obesity rates have more than doubled since 1980. In 2008, 1.5 billion adults were overweight; of this, 200 million men and about 300 million women were obese. Of the global population, 65% live in countries where being overweight kills more people than being underweight. And in 2010, nearly 43 million kids under the age of 5 were overweight. The numbers are just as staggering for diabetes. The WHO claims that roughly 346 million people worldwide suffer from this disease. In 2004, an estimated 34 million people died as a consequence of it. This week, the U.N. General Assembly will establish new policy resolutions that nations should adopt, with a focus on three key areas: to acknowledge the rising incidence and consequences of these health threats, to strengthen national institutional capabilities as well as policies for prevention and to foster greater international cooperation. Delegates will also discuss the creation of a U.N. monitoring framework that will track the growth of noncommunicable diseases. Nations are also expected to agree formally that by 2012, they will submit their policy recommendations and commitments to the General Assembly. What's the big deal about this meeting? It's a big deal because this will be only the second time that the United Nations has convened to discuss health issues. The first time was in 2001 when it addressed the HIV/AIDS crisis. Including a focus on obesity and diabetes is also significant because it is the first time that these health issues have reached this level of U.N. attention. Previously, obesity and diabetes were addressed only through WHO regional reports and conferences, most recently with the WHO's 2004 report ""Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity, and Health,"" which failed to garner the attention of the entire U.N. system. The assembly meeting is also significant because, as the governing body of the World Bank and the WHO, the United Nations sends a clear message to these institutions that they need to increase their financial and technical support to combat these health threats. But will developing nations take the new U.N. resolutions seriously? Probably not, and for several reasons. The first simply has to do with the availability of international funding for obesity and diabetes, especially when compared with HIV/AIDS. The focus on HIV/AIDS has created an international bias in favor of committing more funding for HIV/AIDS rather than obesity and diabetes. International financial support for obesity and diabetes has been minimal at best. The U.N.'s International Diabetes Federation recently stated that most bilateral and multilateral funding does not provide funding for obesity, diabetes and other related noncommunicable diseases, while only 0.9% of the $22 billion spent on international health is provided for these diseases. What's more, the assembly's draft resolution does not make the need to raise funding for obesity, diabetes and other noncommunicable diseases a priority. Also, because the resolution says nothing about creating a new Global Fund for noncommunicable diseases, there is serious doubt that increased financial support will emerge. Second, in many developing nations, obesity and diabetes is still seen as an epidemic that mainly affects the rich. When most of the population is malnourished, politicians do not see a need to introduce new legislation for obesity and diabetes. In some nations, such as China, obesity is seen as a sign of good fortune. But ignoring the diseases will contribute to high health care costs, especially as nations strive for universal coverage and as the rich and middle classes grow. Finally, developing nations are unlikely to respond to new resolutions because there is little civil societal pressures to do so. In most nations, no proactive, well-organized civic movement has emerged in response to obesity and diabetes. While some exceptions exist, such as India's All India Association for Advancing Research in Obesity and China's Chinese Diabetes Society, they lack adequate funding, domestic and international support. The U.N. meeting this week will certainly raise a lot of eyebrows and draw attention. But until the United Nations and other international bodies commit serious financial resources to help developing nations tackle obesity, diabetes and other noncommunicable diseases, until governments overcome their political perceptions and until civil society mobilizes and pressures governments for a response, high-end U.N. meetings will only succeed in doing what they do best: writing reports, venting complaints and pointing fingers. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Eduardo J. Gómez.","Eduardo Gómez: U.N meeting this week to address diseases, including obesity, diabetes .

"Mexico City (CNN) -- On the eve of a meeting of Mexico´s top prosecutors and judicial officials in Veracruz state, authorities Wednesday were still trying to determine who left 35 bodies in a busy thoroughfare there -- and why. Investigators said a video may hold clues to how unidentified men managed to drive two open-back trucks filled with corpses through rush-hour traffic and then abandon them, blocking traffic as stunned onlookers watched. Police in the Gulf coast state of Veracruz found the abandoned trucks and the bodies near a shopping mall in the municipality of Boca del Rio on Tuesday. Mexico´s state prosecutors and court presidents are scheduled to meet there Thursday. Photos of the scene showed the two trucks with their back gates open, the bodies falling out onto the street. People on a nearby overpass looked down on shirtless bodies piled on top of each other. ¨This is a way of making yourself known, and saying, ´We have the power, we can do this with impunity,´¨ said Jose Reveles, a security analyst. ""'We do it at five in the evening, in a heavily traveled avenue. We drive two trucks loaded with cadavers, and nobody stops us.'"" Drug-related violence has been on the rise in Veracruz as cartel members battle over territory. But the large toll gripped headlines across Mexico and drew attention from peace activists gathering in a conference in the nation´s capital Wednesday. ""They were left like trash in the street,"" said Edgardo Buscaglia, president of the Institute of Citizen Action for Justice and Democracy. Buscaglia, an expert on organized crime, told audience members that the bodies found in Veracruz are a reminder that Mexicans must not become desensitized to violence, even if authorities say the victims had criminal histories. ""The value of a human life does not decrease because it has a criminal background or not,"" he said. The dead included 12 women and 23 men. The video may show that the two trucks were guarded by other cars that could have doubled as getaway vehicles, Veracruz Attorney General Reynaldo Escobar Perez said Wednesday in a radio interview. He did not say where the video came from. Investigators also are looking into whether police colluded with the people who discarded the bodies, he told W Radio. As of Wednesday, morning, 95% of the bodies had been identified through databases, Escobar Perez said. Most of them had criminal records, he said. One of them was identified as a local policeman who disappeared about 15 days ago, he said. In another interview, the attorney general said that the victims died of suffocation. Only one had a bullet wound, he said. The state of the bodies led investigators to deduce they died shortly before being abandoned, Escobar Perez said. The attorney general on Tuesday described the grisly discovery as ""unprecedented."" ""It hasn't happened before in the state of Veracruz,"" he said. The two trucks were abandoned in the middle of the highway, witnesses said. Their gates were open and bodies had fallen out. Hours later, bloodstains remained on the road as troops stood guard. Boca del Rio is in Veracruz state's most populated area. It has become a frequent site of clashes between armed groups as drug-related violence grows. Earlier Tuesday, 32 inmates escaped from three prisons in Veracruz, authorities said. At least 14 of them have been apprehended. Escobar Perez said none of the bodies that had been identified by Tuesday night appeared connected with the prison breaks. Government figures indicate that more than 34,600 people have been killed in drug-related violence since Mexican President Felipe Calderon began a crackdown on cartels in December 2006. Other reports estimate that more than 40,000 have died. The latest government figures were released in January. Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly Wednesday, Calderon decried the violence caused by drug trafficking and called on fellow leaders to put a stop to the burgeoning weapons trade and rampant drug consumption fueling it. ¨Today we must be aware that organized crime today is killing more people and more youth than all the dictatorial regimes combined at this time,¨ he said.

"St. Petersburg, Florida (CNN) -- I first met Dan Wheldon in 2003, when he stepped into the cockpit of the Klein Tools/Jim Beam Indy car at Andretti Green Racing, just before the third race of the season at the Twin Ring Motegi racing track in eastern Japan. He was a cocky, fastidious 23-year-old in those days, with a quick step and a winning way that made him seem like a modern-day Dickens character brought to life. ""Young Wheldon,"" I called him back then. He loved that. We began our Honda Racing careers together. I was hired by the company around the same time Dan was hired as test driver for development of the Honda engine that would make its IndyCar debut during that season. In short order, he became one of Honda's favorite sons. In 2004, he became the first Honda-powered driver ever to win an IndyCar event at the magnificent Motegi complex. The Honda-owned course had not seen one of its own cars take the checkered flag at its signature event in six futile attempts. He won Motegi again in 2005 and then went on to win that year's Indianapolis 500 and the IndyCar Series championship, a feat that has not since been matched. There were numerous highlights after that: 16 IndyCar victories in all, culminating in this year's completely implausible win in the Centennial Indianapolis 500. Services held for Wheldon in Florida . That's what the record book says. It documents Dan's legacy in numbers. But it doesn't come close to capturing his legacy in the hearts of those who knew him. The Dan I knew was more than a racer. He was a friend. A husband. A father. A hero. He loved shoes. He loved watches. He loved the food my trackside chef, Tim Olszewski, prepared at virtually every IndyCar Series event. (That hardly made him unique -- Tim is a really good chef.) What set Dan apart was his genuine interest in all the members of the hospitality staff. He treated them all as his equals, and as a consequence, they were all left equally shattered after the tragedy. Around the track, just about everyone had their own ""Dan Wheldon moment."" He had an uncanny talent to connect quickly and personally with everyone he met -- whether high-dollar sponsor or Turn 3 bleacher-ite -- and to give each of them something far more valuable than an autograph or a photo. He left them with his kindness, his spirit. He never turned down a single request, whether it was for an appearance at a dealer meeting, a ride-and-drive with the media or a quick ""Hello"" to a group of trackside guests. In each case, he brought a smile that was manufactured only in the most literal sense -- his realigned teeth after his '05 championship were an ongoing source of paddock amusement -- but genuine in every other imaginable way. In a world where part of the competitive ethos is to convey at all costs an impression of invulnerability, Dan was the exception. As a colleague said to me the other day, ""He let you in."" My Dan Wheldon moment occurred after the Centennial Indianapolis 500 this past May. After winning the prestigious race for the second time, Dan had just concluded an exuberant celebratory victory lap at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. He returned to Victory Circle to begin the Hat Dance -- that incessant procession of ballcaps and photo ops, which, for understandable reasons, lasts about five times as long at Indianapolis as at any other track on the IndyCar Series circuit. Dan had just stepped into the cockpit, and had the first hat in hand, when he looked to his left and saw me standing along the railing that divided the race car from the rabble. He placed the hat on the car's nose, got out, walked around to my side of the car and grabbed me. I barely remember what he said to me, but I do remember hearing a loud cheer from the grandstand above us in Victory Circle. And I remember thinking, ""That's pretty cool. Some people I know are happy that I'm getting this moment."" It wasn't until we separated, and Dan resumed the headwear ritual, that I looked above me to see that I did not recognize a single face among those who had been doing the cheering. Whether or not it is true, I'm going to continue in the belief that those spectators were paying tribute to the emotion of a moment between the Indianapolis 500 winner and some guy none of them had ever met. And that blew me away. Just before he returned to his car, Daniel and I spent time crying in each other's arms. We were crying tears of joy, feeling all the pain and all the hard work it took to get to that moment, and celebrating all the promise the future would hold for him. After last Sunday afternoon, I am not ashamed to admit, I have cried in many other arms, as well.","Thomas ""T.E."" McHale: Dan Wheldon was more than a superb driver -- he was a hero .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN)  -- Thai authorities seized a cargo aircraft carrying tons of weapons from North Korea during a refueling stop in Bangkok, a government official said. The pilot told Thai authorities the aircraft was headed to Sri Lanka, but its final destination was unknown, according to Panitan Wattanayagorn, a spokesman for the Thai prime minister. It contained about 35 tons of weapons, including rocket-propelled grenades, shoulder-launched rockets and tubes that may be missile components, the spokesman said. The plane, which was detained Saturday, had five people onboard -- four from Kazakhstan and one from Belarus. They will appear in court Monday on charges related to illegal weapons smuggling, the spokesman said. Thai government officials acted after working with several intelligence agencies for several weeks, the spokesman said. The cargo was taken to a military base while the plane, which is registered in Georgia, remains at Don Muang. Sri Lanka officials said there were no shipments scheduled in the country either by air or sea from North Korea. ""We have asked the Sri Lanka embassy in Bangkok to obtain details from the Thai authorities,"" the ministry said. ""We will have more information on the progress of their investigation later on Sunday."" Such an aircraft could not have landed in any of Sri Lanka's airports without prior authorization, officials in Colombo said. Last year, two arm dealers were arrested in Thailand. The men's arrest came after a series of events that involved law enforcement agencies from at least five countries, including two undercover agents from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. Viktor Bout and his associate, Andrew Smulian, made millions of dollars delivering weapons and ammunition to warlords and militants, officials said. Bout is accused of supplying weapons to war zones around the world -- from Sierra Leone to Afghanistan. He has repeatedly said he has not broken any laws and the allegations against him are lies . A Thai court rejected a U.S. extradition request for Bout in August. CNN's Dan Rivers and journalist Iqbal Athas contributed to this report.","Plane contained about 35 tons of weapons, including rocket-propelled grenades and shoulder-launched rockets .

"(CNN) -- Endurance swimmer Diana Nyad was stung by a sea creature for a second time Saturday night and was being treated by doctors, her team said in a blog post, leaving the continuation of her swim in question. The 62-year-old, in transit from Havana to Florida, was stung by some kind of presumed jellyfish, the blog said. ""Her face and eyes and the area around her eyes are affected. She is out of the water and aboard the transom of the Voyager where she is being treated by doctors. It will be up to Diana to decide whether or not to continue to the swim."" The incident was another setback for the athlete, who was stung by Portuguese man o' war earlier in the day. At 6:30 p.m., Nyad was 49 miles from Havana. Having passed the 24-hour mark, she was entering a critical time in her quest to cover the 103 miles. ""Tonight, her second night in the open water, may be the most critical,"" the team wrote. ""Steve Munatones, the independent observer for the International Swim Federation who is accompanying the expedition, says that swimmers have a much better chance of success if they can make it through the second night."" There was a bit of excitement early Saturday afternoon. An oceanic whitetip shark swam near Nyad, but a diver on her team faced it off and it meandered away. The swimmer improved her performance late Saturday morning after struggling to maintain her usual stroke rate, her support team said. Fortified by chicken soup, Nyad was making good progress until the Saturday evening incident. ""This afternoon -- it is stunning to actually witness -- Diana is swimming stronger and stronger,"" one post said. ""Her strokes are up to 50 per minute, she is eating pasta, gobbling bananas, bits of peanut butter sandwiches, along with high-carb & high calorie liquid concoctions."" The going was rough before dawn Saturday, when Nyad had stopped her freestyle stroke and complained that she couldn't breathe properly after getting stung. Doctors from the University of Miami gave the swimmer a shot to reduce inflammation, oxygen and other medication, the blog said, and after treading water for an hour Nyad said she felt better. Candace Hogan, a friend who has been on most of Nyad's swims since 1978, said she could recover and complete the 100-plus mile marathon, the blog said. The team initially said Nyad had likely been stung by a moon jellyfish but revised that to say it was the more troublesome Portuguese man o' war. A National Institutes of Health report says an encounter with a Portuguese man o' war can lead to ""significant systemic reactions"" but rarely death. While mild stings generally produce localized pain, severe ones can provoke symptoms ranging from headaches to seizures, delirium, coma and paralysis, as well as breathing problems, cramping and vomiting, the NIH says. Chief handler Bonnie Stoll said on Twitter that Nyad had been ""stung along both arms the side of her body and her face."" Nyad had to clear herself of tentacles, change her swimsuit and put on a shirt for protection after the incident. Another member of Nyad's support team said the way she handled the setback was a ""testament to her strength."" ""It was scary,"" Stoll said. ""But Diana is happy that this happened early while she is still at her strongest."" A safety diver who entered the water to help Nyad was also stung numerous times, her blog said. He received treatment back on one of the flotilla of boats accompanying her. Nyad began her swim just after 6 p.m. Friday from Havana's Hemingway Marina. The former world champion swimmer expects the swim to take close to 60 hours, which would put her into Florida sometime Monday. Nyad last attempted this swim in early August and had to be pulled from the water after some 60 miles, and almost 29 hours of swimming. She blamed a shoulder injury she suffered early in the journey, and an 11-hour-long asthma attack. Her first Cuba-Florida attempt, back in 1978, was brought to an end by strong currents and bad weather after almost 42 hours in the water, according to her website. CNN's Matt Sloane and Shasta Darlington contributed to this report.","NEW: She is deciding whether she can continue the swim .

"Washington (CNN) -- Reactions ranged from gloom-and-doom predictions to celebrations to ho-hum business-as-usual as the U.S. military changed its rules Tuesday to allow gay men and lesbians to serve openly. A minute into the new day, at 12:01 a.m., the old ""don't ask, don't tell"" rule that has been in force since the Clinton administration was gone. In its place was a policy designed to be blind to sexual orientation and one that the Pentagon brass insists will maintain the military in fighting trim, with no negative impact on ""military readiness, military effectiveness, unit cohesion and recruiting and retention."" Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen told a news conference that the repeal enhanced the integrity of the nation's fighting forces. ""They'll all get up, they'll all go to work, and they'll all be able to do that work honestly, and their fellow citizens will be safe, and that's all that really matters,"" Mullen said. Some members of the U.S. military -- many who carefully hid both their identities and sexual orientation for years -- wasted no time in going public. That included the man who until now had been known as J.D. Smith. Smith had been at the forefront of pushing for the repeal, as co-founder and co-director of a group called OutServe, which bills itself as the Association of Actively Serving LGBT Military Personnel. As an active-duty service member, he would only speak to the media under a pseudonym. Under the new rules, his real identity can be revealed, and he announced at a news conference Tuesday that he is 1st Lt. Josh Seefried, an airman serving on a base in New Jersey. Until now, Seefried said, he had worried every day that he could lose his military career if it became known he was gay. ""Today and every day I can go back into work with that burden lifted off my shoulders and not have to worry about it any more,"" he said. Concerns of a possible hostile reaction from heterosexual colleagues were unfounded, Seefried said, adding that ""no one's going hurt us when we go back to our units."" Others joined him. OutServe published a new edition Tuesday called the ""Repeal Issue."" It was available on some military bases around the world and included photos of 101 active service members openly stating they are gay. The OutServe magazine is also distributed online. ""Now we are stepping forward, to a new day, a new life,"" wrote Air Force Staff Sgt. Jonathan Mills. ""A life of openness, integrity, of honor. At last, our country has accepted us -- not for who we love or how we love but who we are."" The magazine said its photo essay on 101 people serving in the military represented just a portion of the approximately 70,000 ""currently serving"" lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender military personnel. ""Today, for the first time in our history, we will welcome the service of any qualified individual who's willing to put on the uniform of our country,"" said Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, a Republican credited with corralling support for the repeal. Sen. Chris Coons, D-Delaware, called it ""a day to celebrate that it does get better, and we are moving toward a more perfect union."" Seefried wrote a book on his experiences titled ""Our Time: Breaking the Silence of 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell."" It had been advertised under his cover identify, but now Amazon is ready to substitute his real name on the book, he said. ""The book is really important to me because this ties into people finding out that there are other gay military members out there serving,"" Seefried earlier told CNN. ""I remember a book I read when I was in college done by a gay military officer and it gave me courage and I hope this book does the same."" He admitted a lot of people will be surprised, including friends and co-workers of his, as well as many thousands of other military personnel who may learn something new about their battle buddies or colleagues. ""People will be shocked, but at least they are going to be talking about it,"" Seefried said. ""And talking can bring down barriers."" One of the most vocal and active proponents of the change, Alex Nicholson of Servicemembers United, was discharged from the Army in 2002 under the old policy. ""I think it is a combination of thoughts and feelings,"" Nicholson said in a telephone interview. ""It's going to be vindication for people discharged. Also there is a sense of relief."" He looks back at the speeches he gave around the country, sometimes in the face of such opposition that he required police protection, and to the political bargaining sessions. ""I feel very fortunate to have been one of those in the rooms on Capitol Hill and in the White House and with senior administration staff,"" Nicholson said. Congress finally voted in the repeal of the law last December and President Barack Obama signed the legislation just before Christmas. Panetta said Tuesday that more than 97% of the nation's 2.3 million uniformed service personnel had been trained for the end of ""don't ask, don't tell."" One of the most prominent congressional supporters of the change, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, said that from now on, thousands of Americans will be able to serve their country without concealing part of their identity. ""They will no longer have to lie in order to help protect us,"" Levin said in a statement released by his staff. ""The end of 'don't ask, don't tell' is an important victory not just for equality, but integrity."" But a longtime opponent of the change, Elaine Donnelly of the Center for Military Readiness, said she was concerned that allowing gays and lesbians to serve would drive many loyal troops out of the military. ""Due to the president's political promises, the military faces heavy burdens of confusion and tension that could have been avoided,"" Donnelly said. ""This is nothing for the administration to be proud of."" She said it may be years before the damage to the military is apparent, as some people delay their departure because of a weak economy. It would not be wise to consider recruiting, retention and morale to be assured indefinitely, Donnelly said. Servicemembers United said today that 14,346 people were discharged under the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy. Some of the people who were forced out under the old policy are now reapplying, as the new rules reopen a door that had been shut. Michael Almy was an Air Force officer for 13 years and helped control the air space over Iraq during some of the fiercest fighting of the war. He left in 2006. ""My hope is to get back in. I've talked to recruiters. I'm starting to look at that process,"" Almy said. He says that nothing is going to repair the damage to his career, after a five-year gap. ""I'm hoping that I can at least get back in there where I left off and resume my career -- hopefully, just be a role model,"" Almy said. ""Because that's what we need right now; we need gay and lesbian role models, officers and enlisted alike, who can serve honestly and openly next to their straight counterparts and show no detriment to the mission whatsoever."" Servicemembers United's Nicholson predicts smooth sailing for all sides in the coming weeks and months. ""I think the real story is going to be the non-story,"" Nicholson said. ""What this is going to do is normalize everything that is already there."" CNN's Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","NEW: Defense, military chiefs say the repeal is about the integrity of the force .

"(CNN) -- Colombia's main leftist rebel group shot and killed four hostages held for more than a decade, President Juan Manuel Santos said Saturday, vowing to fight the rebels with everything in reach. A fifth hostage, a policeman, was found alive, Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzon told reporters. ""This is yet another example of how brutal and cruel the FARC is. ... When faced with security forces, they (the rebels) had no qualms about killing them in cold blood,"" Santos said. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as FARC, has been at war with the Colombian government since the 1960s. While severely weakened in recent years, the guerrilla group has continued to carry out kidnappings and attack security forces. Chains were found near the bodies of the four hostages, who were kidnapped ""more than 12 or 13 years"" ago, Santos said. The president called the killings a ""crime against humanity"" and swore their only effect would be to make police and soldiers more determined to fight ""with everything in reach."" The bodies of the four men, all of whom were security force members, were found in the morning, according to Pinzon. They were executed in the southern region of Caqueta, where the military was conducting operations against the rebel group, he said. Three of the hostages were shot in the head, while the fourth was shot in the back, the defense minister said. The fifth hostage, identified as Luis Alberto Erazo, had been held for roughly 12 years, Pinzon said. He reportedly ran from the rebel camp at the start of a firefight between rebels and Colombian troops. His condition is ""acceptable,"" Pinzon said. Earlier this month, a military operation killed then-FARC leader Alfonso Cano. Following his death, the FARC released a statement in which its leaders said they would not end their guerrilla struggle.","NEW: A fifth hostage is found alive, Colombia's defense minister says .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's fear that promoters would ""pull the plug"" on his comeback concerts if he missed more rehearsals was unfounded, the head of the promotion company testified Tuesday in Dr. Conrad Murray's involuntary manslaughter trial. ""No one on our end was ever contemplating pulling the plug,"" said Randy Phillips, the head of AEG Live. Murray's defense lawyers contend Jackson self-administered the overdose of drugs that killed him in a ""desperate desire to get to sleep,"" because he feared without rest he would miss his next rehearsal and trigger the cancellation of his ""This Is It"" tour. Jackson's mother, Katherine, sisters Janet and La Toya, and brother Randy Jackson were in court to watch Tuesday's testimony. Earlier Tuesday, a nurse who tried to treat Jackson's insomnia with natural remedies testified that Jackson told her that doctors assured him using the surgical anesthetic propofol at home to induce sleep was safe as long as he was monitored. Jackson died two months after that conversation with nurse Cherilyn Lee, from what the coroner ruled was an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol, combined with sedatives. Prosecutors contend Dr. Murray's use of propofol to treat Jackson's insomnia in his home was reckless, in part because he did not have proper equipment to monitor his patient and he abandoned him to make phone calls. Phillips was the eighth witness called by the defense since the prosecution rested its case against Murray Monday morning. If the tour was canceled, Jackson would have to pay for all of the production and rehearsal costs, Phillips said, although the judge would not let him tell jurors how much that might have been. Defense lawyer Ed Chernoff estimated the cost to be about $40 million, leaving him ""a very, very poor man,"" but it was not while the jury was present. Concert director Kenny Ortega sent Phillips an e-mail five days before Jackson's death referring to Jackson's fear the company would ""pull the plug"" on the tour. The e-mail triggered a meeting with Jackson and Dr. Murray to address Ortega's concerns about Jackson's ""lack of focus"" and missed rehearsals, with the debut of his London shows just three weeks away. He and Ortega were satisfied when Jackson told them ""You build the house and I will put on the door and paint it,"" suggesting he would be ready, Phillips testified. Also at the meeting, Phillips told Dr. Murray that he wanted to make sure he knew about Jackson's visits to another doctor, dermatologist Dr. Arnold Klein. ""Because he's his principal physician, I thought he should know,"" he said. Phillips said he was concerned because Jackson ""seemed a little distracted and not focused"" in a meeting after a visit to Klein's Beverly Hills clinic. The defense contends Jackson became addicted to the painkiller Demerol in his frequent visits to Klein in the three months before his death. His withdrawal from the Demerol, which Murray was unaware of, would explain why Jackson could not sleep the day he died, the defense contends. Testimony from nurse Cherilyn Lee's was interrupted for 25 minutes Tuesday as she was overcome with emotion. ""I'm feeling really, really dizzy,"" Lee said. ""This is just very sensitive to me."" Lee and a Los Angeles doctor, both called as defense witnesses, testified that Jackson asked them for drugs to help him sleep in April 2009. This was after Dr. Murray had already agreed to work as his personal physician and placed his first orders for propofol. Lee, who used IV drips loaded with vitamins, ""sophisticated"" vitamin smoothies and bedtime teas, to treat Jackson's insomnia, said Jackson became frustrated with her natural remedies. ""He said 'I'm telling you the only thing that's going to help me sleep right away is the Diprivan and can you find someone to help me to sleep?'"" Lee said. Diprivan is a brand name for propofol. After some quick research, the nurse warned Jackson that it was dangerous to use propofol at home, Lee testified. Jackson was not deterred, she said, even after she asked him ""but what if you don't wake up?"" Deputy District Attorney David Walgren asked her, ""And he responded, 'I will be OK, I only need someone to monitor me with the equipment while I sleep'?"" ""Yes, that's exactly what I said,"" Lee said. Dr. Allan Metzger, who treated Jackson off and on for two decades for ""his profound sleep disorder,"" testified Monday that Jackson called him to his home on April 18, 2009, to ask for ""intravenous sleep medicine"" to help him sleep. Jackson wanted the anesthetic delivered by IV because ""he did not believe any oral medicine would be helpful,"" Dr. Metzger said. Metzger declined Jackson's request, instead giving him prescriptions for two oral sedatives to help him sleep.","NEW: Jackson would've had to pay production, rehearsal costs if tour was canceled, promoter says .

"(LonelyPlanet.com) -- Vampires and their stories seem to be enjoying an eternal renaissance in contemporary fiction and film. Anne Rice's ""Interview with the Vampire"" kicked off the modern raft of tales, and the popularity of more recent book and movie offerings like ""Twilight"" and ""True Blood"" shows that folks are, well, batty for vampire tales. So where can you go to learn more about these creatures of the night? Discover the top destinations with this excerpt from Lonely Planet's Best in Travel. Bran Castle, Romania . There's nothing better than going to the source, and in the case of vampire lore that's Vlad Ţepeş, legendary ruler of Wallachia, now part of Romania. Ţepeş became the scourge of the Ottoman empire and was fond of impaling entire Turkish forces sent against him. His bloodthirsty reputation inspired Irish author Bram Stoker to use him as the model for ""Dracula,"" and thus a legend was born. Bran Castle, one of his strongholds, now houses a museum dedicated to Queen Marie of Romania. It has an impressive clifftop profile, looking like the quintessential location for a vampire movie. Vampire Bats, Costa Rica . The vampire bat has become inseparable from the legend of the vampire. Apparently inspired by a newspaper article about these inhabitants of South and Central America, Bram Stoker wove their blood-sucking habits into his novel and the rest is history (or at least, folklore). These small bats do feed on animals' blood but rarely suck on humans, though there have been reported attacks in recent years in Brazil and Venezuela. One of the best places to see them in the wild is Costa Rica, especially within Santa Rosa National Park and Corcovado National Park. Lonely Planet: How to travel like a kid . Musée Des Vampires, France . Hidden away in the Les Lilas district of Paris is an enigmatic museum devoted to the vampire. Visits can only be made by appointment, but once through the forbidding red door, the visitor is treated to an eclectic collection of books, photographs, weapons, masks, models, costumes and other curios referencing the vampire legend. There's also a creepy Gothic garden out the back. The Musée des Vampires. Forks, Washington . When author Stephanie Meyer set her vampire novel ""Twilight"" in the small town of Forks, Washington, she had little idea of the wave of vampire tourism she was setting in motion. When ""Twilight"" went ballistic on the bookshelves, ardent fans headed for Forks, neatly arresting the slow economic decline caused by its traditional mainstay, the timber industry, losing momentum. Now vampire fans can buy undead memorabilia, go on tours to locations that resemble Edward and Bella's literary hangouts, and celebrate Bella's birthday on 13 September. Dazzled by Twilight offers three Twilight-themed tours of Forks and La Push. Vampire Tour of San Francisco . Anyone who's read Bram Stoker's Dracula will remember Mina Harker, whom Dracula attacked with the intent of transforming her into a vampire. Given that this curse was apparently lifted once he was destroyed, you might be surprised to find Mina Harker wafting about in 21st-century San Francisco, and sporting an American accent. But every weekend you can join Mina for a vampire tour of the city's historic Nob Hill. It covers documented San Francisco history as well as speculative supernatural events, and attendees are encouraged to dress spookily. The Vampire Tour of San Francisco commences at 8 p.m. each Friday and Saturday. Dracula Tour of London, UK . Given the British capital's starring role in the original Dracula novel, it makes sense that there should be a vampire tour of its darker nooks and crannies. This supernatural outing takes in a house in Highgate where the vampiric one apparently lived during his London sojourn. It also takes in the ghosts of Highgate Cemetery, the satanists of Highgate Woods, and other dark denizens. Curiously, the whole thing is then followed with a medieval banquet. Blood, presumably, is not on the menu. The Dracula Tour of London, run by Transylvania Live, takes place nightly except Mondays. Pontianak, Indonesia . Vampiric creatures aren't just a Western obsession. Malaysia and Indonesia share the legend of the pontianak, supposedly the undead manifestation of a woman who has died during childbirth. This supernatural being is said to take the form of a beautiful woman, attracting men to their deaths by disemboweling them with her razor-sharp fingernails. You wouldn't really want to encounter one of these hellhounds, but if feeling brave you might visit the city of Pontianak, said to be named after the undead creature which once terrorized its men. Pontianak is the capital of the Indonesia province of West Kalimantan, on the island of Borneo. Lonely Planet: Hotels where famous people have died . Dracula's Haunts, Whitby, UK . Before ""Dracula"" reached London in the pages of Bram Stoker's novel, he came ashore at Whitby. The North Yorkshire seaport is famous for being the home base of 18th-century explorer Captain James Cook. However, no amount of historic circumstance can top Stoker's evocative description of the Russian schooner Demeter blown across Whitby's harbour with its dead captain lashed to the helm, crashing beneath the East Cliff before disgorging the vampire in the guise of a huge dog. As a result, Whitby has become a popular destination for vampire-fanciers. The Whitby Gothic Weekend is held twice-yearly, in April and October, and features concerts, markets and comedy nights. ""Buffy"" locations, USA . ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" gained vampires a big new TV audience in the 1990s. If you loved seeing Sarah Michelle Gellar stake scowly-faced evil vampires while finding time to fall in love with a reformed one then you might like to visit the locations in and around Los Angeles where the series was filmed. The series' exterior scenes at Sunnydale High School were in fact filmed at Torrance High School. Shots of the fictional University of California at Sunnydale were taken at the UCLA campus in Westwood, and at California State University in Northridge. And the vampire mansion once lived in by Angel, Spike and Drusilla is the Frank Lloyd Wright--designed Ennis House near Griffith Park. You can find a comprehensive list of Buffy locations within the IMDb entry for ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer."" ""True Blood"" locations, USA . Bon Temps, Louisiana, is the fictional town in ""True Blood,"" the rightful heir to the vampire-mania stoked by Buffy. As with Buffy, the main character of the show is female, Sookie Stackhouse, who, like Buffy, falls in love with vampires. Unlike Buffy, vampires no longer hide from mainstream society -- they have 'come out of the coffin' to drink a synthetic human blood (True Blood). But vampires aren't the only supernatural citizens of Bon Temps. Werewolves, werepanthers, faeries, shapeshifters and maenads also roam its streets. While all the human characters in the series pass through Merlotte's Bar & Grill, the vampires of the show frequent Fangtasia, a bar owned by the thousand-year-old vampire Eric Northman in Shreveport, Louisiana. The actual bar used for some of the filming is located in Long Beach, California, so if you want to be a fang banger then head to Alex's Bar. Other True Blood film locations are scattered over Southern USA and California. Seeing Stars has a site dedicated to finding these sights. Originally published as ""Fangtastic!

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods' former caddy Steve Williams has issued an apology after apparently making racially tinged remarks at an awards dinner in Shanghai, China. Williams -- who was fired by Woods in July -- was being presented with a satirical award for ""celebration of the year"" for comments he made after his new boss, golfer Adam Scott, beat Woods at the Bridgestone Invitational in Ohio a month later. According to media reports, when asked about those comments during his acceptance speech Friday night, Williams said: ""I wanted to shove it up that black ---."" Should Williams be punished for Tiger remarks? Shortly afterward, the New Zealander issued an contrite statement on his website. ""I apologize for comments I made last night at the Annual Caddy Awards dinner in Shanghai. Players and caddies look forward to this evening all year and the spirit is always joking and fun. ""I now realize how my comments could be construed as racist. However I assure you that was not my intent. I sincerely apologize to Tiger and anyone else I have offended."" Woods is in Australia preparing for the President Cups teams event in Melbourne starting November 17. His agent Mark Steinberg said in a statement: ""I was with Tiger when the story broke. We were obviously not there, but if all the reports are accurate, it is regrettable. Really nothing more to say."" In several interviews after his dismissal, which brought to an end a 13-year working relationship, Williams let it be known that he was disappointed and shocked and also brought up Woods' sex scandal. Interviewed after Scott's Bridgestone victory, Williams called it the ""greatest week I've had in my career."" Scott and Williams are at Sheshan, near Shanghai, to take part in the HSBC Champions golf tournament and the Australian was reportedly among the audience at the awards dinner. The row over Williams' remarks has led to media speculation that the partnership may not last much longer. However, Scott told reporters that he would not be taking any action. ""Steve issued a statement and apologized, and he did the right thing. That's all there is to say about that from my side of things,"" said the 31-year-old, who was in third place at the Chinese tournament ahead of Sunday's final round, three shots behind Swedish leader Fredrik Jacobson. ""It's not an issue for me. I think everything in that room last night was all in good spirits and a bit of fun, and I think it probably got taken out of that room in the wrong context. ""Anything with Tiger involved is a story. I value Steve's contribution to my game and while he's caddying I hope he can caddy for me. ""There was a lot of language used last night and it's just this was reported. I don't really think that stuff has ever left the room before and it's probably good reasons why. I think it's probably all very unnecessary."" It is not the first time Williams has had to apologize for inappropriate remarks. Three years ago he made derogatory comments about Woods' great rival Phil Mickelson at a charity event in New Zealand and was later forced to back down by his employer. Former U.S. Open champion Graeme McDowell told the UK Press Association that he did not believe Williams had intended to make a racial remark. ""The comments were surprising, yes. These are racially sensitive times, especially in sport. It's unfortunate because it was a very sticky situation,"" the Northern Irishman said. ""I don't think Stevie Williams was trying to be racial. I don't think it was a racial comment. I think he was trying to be funny and make a joke of it. ""It was an embarrassing situation that he was put in. He was up in front of his peers and colleagues and it came out wrong."" Scott shot three-under-par 69 in Saturday's third round to be on 13-under 203 at the tournament, which offers more than $1.1 million to the winner and will have a big influence on who wins the European Tour money list. World No. 3 Rory McIlroy is seeking to overhaul top-ranked Luke Donald and prevent the Englishman from making history by topping both the U.S. and European money lists in the same year. The Northern Irishman shot 65 on Saturday to climb up to a tie for fourth with Lee Westwood -- four shots behind Jacobson, who carded 67. Former world No. 1 Martin Kaymer, who is fourth in the Race To Dubai standings behind McIlroy and Charl Schwartzel, was tied for sixth with McDowell on 205.","Steve Williams: ""I sincerely apologize to Tiger and anyone else I have offended""

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid moved six points clear in Spain after winning a fiery derby match against nine-man Atletico on Saturday and then seeing defending champions Barcelona suffer a shock first La Liga defeat this season. Real marched to a 13th successive victory in all competitions, while Barca lost 1-0 at lowly Getafe -- who had won just once in seven games. Cristiano Ronaldo scored two penalties as Jose Mourinho's side came from behind to win 4-1 at the Bernabeu, with Atletico having teenage goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois sent off in the 23rd minute for bringing down Karim Benzema when the French striker tried to go around him. The 19-year-old was replaced by substitute keeper Sergio Asenjo, whose first job was to pick the ball out of the net after being beaten by Ronaldo. Angel Di Maria made it 2-1 four minutes after the break when Ronaldo's intended pass to Benzema fell in his path, and fellow Argentina international Gonzalo Higuain pounced on a mistake by Diego Godin in the 65th minute. Godin was also sent off for an 81st-minute foul on Higuain, who had been put through by Ronaldo's clever pass -- and the Portugal forward sent Asenjo the wrong way from the spot to make it 4-1. Atletico had not beaten Real for 12 years, but started the match promisingly as Adrian finished off a fine move to give the mid-table visitors the lead in the 15th minute. Barcelona, seeking to win the league for the fourth season in a row, succumbed to a 67th-minute header from Getafe defender Juan Valera after being caught napping at a corner. The Catalan side poured forward in search of a last-gasp equalizer, but Lionel Messi had an injury-time effort ruled out when substitute Seydou Keita was judged to be offside and then the Argentina star hit the post as he failed to match Ronaldo's leading tally of 16 league goals. Pep Guardiola's team will be hoping to reduce Real's lead in the first Clasico clash in the league this season in Madrid on December 10. Third-placed Valencia bounced back from last weekend's home defeat by Real by winning 2-1 at mid-table Rayo Vallecano. Brazilian striker Jonas put Valencia ahead in the 21st minute and Argentine midfielder Tino Costa made it 2-0 on 56, while Raul Talmudo scored a late consolation. The win left Valencia one point behind Barca after 13 rounds.","Real Madrid extend La Liga lead with 4-1 victory over nine-man Atletico .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- For the first time in more than 40 years, dawn in Libya rose on Friday without the dictator and his shadow. Libyans awoke to empty Friday streets, typical for the holy day of the Muslim week, and engaged in somber reflection about Moammar Gadhafi's life and death. That solemnity followed a wave of unbridled joy Thursday as people exulted over the news of Gadhafi's death and fired their guns in celebration. After Friday prayers at the Salahaddin Mosque in Tripoli, worshippers said their imam had given thanks during his sermon for Gadhafi's downfall. ""Today is a special day at the mosque,"" said Sala Mersal after prayers. ""Since 42 years, we cannot say anything. ... Nobody could say anything inside the mosque. Today it is free, and anybody can say anything they want."" A small crowd gathered outside the mosque, with bullet casings littering the streets, and chanted ""God is great"" and ""One, two, three ... Libya is free!"" Amid the smiles and victory signs, Hisham Boaishi conceded that he did not approve of the ""un-Islamic way"" that Gadhafi was killed. ""We would have liked to take him to court and have his judgment,"" said Boaishi, 33, an information technology specialist who sported a long beard. ""But not this way. We are Muslims; we don't support this way."" Not all residents of Tripoli welcomed Gadhafi's bloody death. One young man, who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisal from anti-Gadhafi forces, said he was ""ashamed"" at the way the former dictator died. He said his mother cried in front of the television Thursday night upon seeing images of the bleeding leader. ""He should have been taken to court,"" the man said. ""I'm not ashamed. I'm proud that we captured him ... no matter how many soldiers he hired,"" said Mohamed Saya, a member of the media committee for Libya's new governing National Transitional Council. NTC officials insist shortly after his capture by rebel forces, the ousted leader was killed in a crossfire between pro- and anti-Gadhafi fighters. With Gadhafi dead, Saya said Libya's de facto government was preparing to hold a ""Liberation Day"" celebration in the eastern city of Benghazi this weekend. Benghazi was the launching point of Libya's uprising in February. In the meantime, some Libyans continued to hold their own smaller festivities. On one Tripoli street, fighters and residents gathered beneath the tri-color banner of Libya's anti-Gadhafi flag next to a camel they planned to slaughter in honor of the dictator's death.","At one mosque in Tripoli, imam gives thanks for dictator's downfall .

"(CNN) -- A grizzly bear attacked and killed a hunter Friday in a remote part of northwestern Montana before being gunned down itself, authorities said. The man who was killed had been part of a hunting party of three men, said Mike Weland, a spokesman for Boundary County, Idaho, which borders Canada and abuts the area where the attack took place. By the time the other two hunters -- one of whom witnessed the attack -- arrived on the site, the man was dead, Weland said. One of the victim's hunting partners eventually shot and killed the grizzly, according to the sheriff's office. Authorities received a cell phone call about 10 a.m. reporting the incident near Buckhorn Mountain, the sheriff's office said. Officials from multiple government agencies were at the site by Friday evening, Weland added a short time later in an e-mail to reporters. At that point, authorities determined that the incident -- initially believed to have happened in northern Idaho -- actually occurred on the Montana side of Buckhorn Mountain, according to Weland. Boundary County sheriff deputies remain on site, but jurisdiction was being transferred to authorities from Lincoln County, Montana. Weland said earlier Friday that authorities were talking with the two survivors and could see the attack site from a distance as they climbed. The sheriff's offices, the Idaho Fish and Game Department, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are investigating. The name of the victim, who was not from Boundary County, was not being released until authorities could notify his next of kin. The incident follows a series of bear attacks in recent months in the United States. Two men were killed this summer in Yellowstone National Park by grizzly bears, Park Superintendent Dan Wenk said. In August, a lone 50-year-old man was bit by a grizzly bear in Montana's Glacier National Park but was able to continue hiking until he found help, the National Park Service said. And earlier this month, two young campers were injured when they were attacked by a black bear at Stokes State Forest in northwestern New Jersey, the state's Department of Environmental Protection said. CNN's Anna Rhett Miller contributed to this report.","NEW: The attack was on the Montana side of Buckhorn Mountain, an Idaho official says .

"(CNN) -- The motorsport community was in mourning on Monday as competitors from across various racing disciplines paid tribute to Marco Simoncelli, the Italian MotoGP rider who lost his life after a crash in Malaysia on Sunday. Simoncelli, 24, sustained critical injuries when he was struck by compatriot Valentino Rossi and American Colin Edwards after losing control of his Honda bike and sliding across Turn 11 of the Sepang Circuit. Rossi, a seven-time MotoGP world champion, used the @ValeYellow46 Twitter account to pay tribute to Simoncelli, who he described as ""a younger brother."" ""Sic [Simoncelli's nickname] for me was like a youngest brother. So strong on track and so sweet in the normal life. I will miss him a lot,"" read the Tweet. Simoncelli killed in Malaysia crash . Honda president and CEO Takanobu Ito praised Simoncelli's commitment and personality, while expressing the team's gratitude for the results he achieved during two seasons with the Japanese outfit. ""Marco Simoncelli was a passionate rider bubbling over with a challenging spirit and blessed with a cheerful personality,"" Ito said on Honda's official website. ""With a promising future on the Grand Prix circuit, Marco had both genuine ability and a large following among racing fans. ""We are very thankful for his sterling results riding for Honda Racing Corporation as a factory rider. We express our heartfelt condolences to Marco's family."" Last year's title winner Jorge Lorenzo missed the race due to surgery on his finger, but the Yamaha rider also paid tribute to Simoncelli -- who was sixth in the 2011 MotoGP standings at the time of his death. ""I don't know what to say on a day like today,"" Lorenzo said via his official Twitter account. ""Only that you will be missed - rest in peace Marco."" Another former world champion to pay his respects to the Cattolica-born star was 2006 winner and current Ducati rider Nicky Hayden. ""Sometimes life just don't make sense,"" said the American. ""RIP #58 you were a star on & off track we all going to miss you."" Spaniard Jorge Martinez is a former rider and current owner of the Aspar Racing Team. The 49-year-old expressed his sadness, while also stating there was nothing Rossi or Edwards could have done to avoid the collision. ""Marco lost the front end and attempted to save the crash, but unfortunately the inertia of the bike took him onto the inside of the corner just when Edwards and Valentino were passing,"" Martinez told the sport's official website. ""There was nothing that they could do to avoid him. Today is a tremendously sad day for the entire paddock and for those who love motorcycle racing."" Outside of MotoGP, drivers from other motorsport disciplines also passed on their condolences to Simoncelli's family and friends. ""My thoughts are with his family, friends and team at this extremely sad time. Another tragic loss at such an early age,"" Tweeted 2008 Formula One world champion and McLaren driver Lewis Hamilton. Hamilton's teammate and 2009 champion Jenson Button also used Twitter to pass on his sympathies. ""R.I.P Marco ... Such an exciting talent lost. My thoughts are with his family, friends and everyone involved in MotoGP,"" said the British driver, before later adding, ""Sometimes motorsport can be so cruel."" Simoncelli's death came a week after British IndyCar driver Dan Wheldon lost his life during a fatal multi-car crash at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway. The president and CEO of the venue Jeff Belskus praised Simoncelli as a racer who was loved among motorsport fans. ""We are deeply saddened at the passing of Marco Simoncelli,"" said Belskus in a statement. ""He was one of the most charismatic figures in the world championship and had a fantastic future ahead of him in MotoGP. ""Marco was one of the most popular riders at the MotoGP event at Indianapolis, as his talent on the motorcycle and his ability to connect with fans both were very special.

"(CNN) -- A 19-year-old Mississippi man was charged with capital murder Tuesday in the death of an African-American man who died after allegedly being beaten by a group of white teens and run over by a truck, authorities said. Deryl Paul Dedmon, 19, of Brandon, Mississippi was also charged by a grand jury with hate-crime enhancement in the murder of James Craig Anderson, said Hinds County District Attorney Robert Shuler Smith. The indictment alleges that Dedmon killed Anderson while in the commission of committing felony robbery, Smith said in a statement. Anderson's family, however, is asking state and federal officials not to seek the death penalty in the case. Relatives of Anderson, who died shortly after receiving his injuries on June 26, sent a letter with their request to Smith, saying the family is opposed to the death penalty partly for religious reasons. The indictment against Dedmon alleged Anderson was targeted because of his race. Dedmon's arraignment has yet to be scheduled, Smith said. Federal authorities have joined the local investigation, and both authorities are determining ""the appropriate venue for the prosecution of any remaining suspects,"" Smith's statement said. ""All options are being considered and with each passing day, more evidence is being gathered,"" Smith said. The death of Anderson, 48, occurred early June 26 in Jackson, allegedly at the hands of white teens who, after a night of partying and drinking, decided to go looking for black people to assault, law enforcement officials have said, quoting one of the suspects in the case. Watch: Incident caught on video . Anderson's death drew national attention after CNN first reported it and aired exclusive surveillance video of the killing, captured by a parking lot security camera in a Jackson suburb. Smith, the district attorney, has called it ""vicious"" and a ""premeditated hate crime."" The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating the death as a possible federal hate crime and assisting local prosecutors. The killing has also prompted several large marches and prayer vigils in Jackson, a city of about 175,000 people. A second teen, John Aaron Rice, 18, was initially charged with murder, but a judge reduced the charge to simple assault because Rice was not believed to be driving the vehicle used to kill Anderson. However, Hinds County prosecutors have said they plan to seek indictments against Rice for murder and a hate crime, and will seek indictments against other teens who were at the scene. The district attorney's office has not officially commented on the family's request for no death penalty in the case. Last week, the Anderson family filed a wrongful death suit against all seven of the white teens alleged to have been present at the beating of Anderson that immediately preceded him being run over by the truck. The Southern Poverty Law Center, a nationally recognized organization based in Montgomery, Alabama, that opposes racism and intolerance, joined the lawsuit. In addition to Dedmon and Rice, the lawsuit names five other teens as taking part in the incident: Sarah Graves of Crystal Springs; Shelbie Richards of Pearl; and William Kirk Montgomery, John Blaylock and Dylan Butler, all of Brandon. None of the five has been arrested or charged. Anderson, a line worker at a Nissan plant, sang in his church choir, according to the family's attorney, Winston J. Thompson III. He leaves behind his partner of 17 years. Attorneys for Dedmon and Rice have not responded to requests for comment from CNN. During a recent bond hearing, Dedmon's attorney told the court he saw nothing to back up the ""racial allegations."" A civil trial can proceed at the same time as a criminal case, but often the civil case is delayed pending the resolution of a criminal trial. While a criminal case is pending, a defendant in a civil case may need to invoke the Fifth Amendment. Authorities believe Dedmon led and instigated the attack, which took place after a night of drinking in largely white Rankin County, outside Jackson. The gang of teens climbed into Dedmon's green truck and a white SUV and drove 16 miles to the western edge of Jackson. They would have seen Anderson immediately as they exited the highway, officials said. He was standing in a hotel parking lot just beyond the exit ramp. On the videotape obtained exclusively by CNN, the group of teens is seen pulling into the parking lot and stopping where Anderson is standing, although he is just off camera and not visible. The teens can then be seen going back and forth between their cars and Anderson. Witnesses told authorities this is when Anderson's beating took place, as the teens yelled racial epithets, including ""white power."" Authorities allege Dedmon and many of the other teens pummeled Anderson repeatedly as he crumpled to the ground, although this is not visible on the tape. After the beating, some of the teens left and others got into the green Ford truck. At this moment, Anderson becomes visible on the tape as he staggers into view and walks toward the truck. ""Defendant Dedmon drove the F-250 out of the parking lot and turned right onto Ellis Avenue,"" the lawsuit says. ""Just as Dedmon turned right, his headlights shone directly on Anderson, who, having been severely beaten, was stumbling in a grassy area near the motel's entrance. Dedmon accelerated, drove onto and over the street curb, and struck Anderson with the front of the F-250."" Shortly afterward, Dedmon allegedly boasted and laughed about the killing, according to statements some of the teens made to detectives. ""I ran that n----- over,"" he allegedly said in a phone conversation to the teens in the other car. The proceedings of the case are taking place in the Hinds County courthouse, where in 1994 Byron de la Beckwith was convicted in the notorious killing of civil rights leader Medgar Evers in 1963.

"(CNN) -- Each year around September 11, CNN Hero Jeff Parness and his volunteers go to a disaster-stricken community to help them rebuild. The efforts are part of New York Says Thank You, an organization Parness created to honor the support that other cities provided after the 2001 terrorist attacks. The volunteer group continues to grow because many of the people it helps go on to ""pay it forward"" and participate in the next year's rebuilding project. Since 2004, nearly 10,000 people nationwide have participated in projects organized by Parness. CNN's Kathleen Toner recently spoke with Parness about his group's plans for the 10th anniversary of 9/11, which includes the final restoration of the National 9/11 Flag. Kathleen Toner: Where did your group decide to go for this year's build? Jeff Parness: (In April) we were watching the news and there were tornadoes that came through northwest Georgia. In the middle of this news clip, there's this beautiful older woman in a destroyed barn with all of her animals. This lovely woman, Susan Littlejohn, lived in the barn with 65 animals that she had rescued (and) used as therapeutic companions for disabled children and seniors. ... So we decided (that) we're going to bring about 300 volunteers from around the country and do a ""barn raising"" in Ellijay, Georgia. Toner: How did it go? Parness: It's hard to compare projects, but in terms of the numbers of people that we got and who turned out from the local community, it was one of most successful events we've ever done. So many local folks came with their families. I think we had close to 2,000 people. We finished about 80 percent of the barn, but the real metric we used to measure success was how many people we drew from the community to teach them about Susan's Build An Ark animal rescue program. ... She's dedicated her life and sacrificed so much for caring for animals and using them as a way to inspire other people and inspire volunteerism. We thought that if she got one more volunteer or one more dollar, it was worth it. That weekend we raised over $15,000 for her, and all kinds of people were volunteering to donate their talents and help with bookkeeping, et cetera. ... At the end of the day, the community of Ellijay realized Susan and her work are very special. Toner: What are your plans for 9/11 this year? Parness: Normally we always do one main building project before 9/11, but for various reasons we did this year's project at the end of July. Now it looks like we've got around 100 people who are going to be gathering in Joplin, Missouri, from September 8 to 11. We're going to be doing two main things. We're painting 3,000 ""Stars of Hope."" This is a project where kids paint inspirational messages of hope and they're planted in all of the corners of the town that were wiped out when the tornado hit on May 22. There are more than 600 intersections that aren't there anymore. When we leave, they are going to be transformed. Everywhere you look there will be these colorful, inspirational messages. The second thing we're doing is really significant: the National 9/11 Flag is going to finish its tour in Joplin. Toner: What is the National 9/11 Flag? Parness: One of the greatest projects that's come out of New York Says Thank You is we wound up being custodians for what's now known as the National 9/11 Flag, which was one of the largest American flags to survive ground zero. The flag is 20 feet high and 30.5 feet wide. The pieces of the flag (were brought) to Greensburg, Kansas, when we were helping to rebuild there (after a 2007 tornado). While we were out building this 14,000-square-foot 4-H barn, all the ladies in the senior citizens' center stitched the flag back together. And where pieces of the original flag were missing, they sewed in American flags that survived the Greensburg tornado. (It) literally stitched together our two histories, both tragedy and triumph, seven years later. After the initial restoration (see photo at left), the flag looked like a beautiful patchwork quilt. But for the past couple of years, we've taken the flag around the country to all 50 states to let local service heroes stitch it back to its original 13-stripe format using pieces of American flags that were being retired. The idea was to (finish it) for this 10th year anniversary of 9/11. It's going to become part of the permanent collection of the 9/11 Memorial Museum that's being built at the World Trade Center. Toner: You really brought it to all 50 states? Parness: Yep. We had a stitching ceremony in Hawaii on Pearl Harbor Day and had World War II veterans stitch the flag. We brought it to Mount Rushmore. ... There have been so many extraordinary locations and people. We've had 25,000 people so far stitch the flag. Toner: What will you be doing with the flag in Joplin on 9/11? Parness: On the morning of the 11th, the National 9/11 Flag will be displayed in a silent tribute at the exact moment that the north and south towers fell. It will be held by Joplin first responders, local residents and disaster survivors from across the United States. The flag will then serve as the backdrop for a 9/11 Memorial Service. And following that, all of the folks in Joplin will be invited to place the final stitches in the flag using fabric that survived the Joplin tornado. It's about bringing people together and giving them the ability to put a stitch in and connect the stories of all of us. ... The symbolism is going to be super powerful. 9/11 didn't just happen in New York or Washington or Shanksville, Pennsylvania -- it happened in America. There are always going to be tragedies in our country like tornadoes. This says we're all going to be there for each other.

"Kansas City, Missouri (CNN) -- Deborah Bradley appeared calm and joyful just hours before her baby daughter was reported missing, according to a supermarket clerk who sold her baby wipes, baby food and boxed wine. ""She had a smile on her face, like she always does when she comes in here,"" said clerk Rebecca Guerrero, whom FBI agents interviewed Saturday about conversations she'd had with Bradley. Surveillance video recorded at a grocery store on October 3 shows Bradley and a man purchasing the items from Guerrero the day before 11-month-old Lisa Irwin was reported missing. Police, who were joined in their search effort by federal authorities last week, have said they have no suspects or solid leads in Lisa's disappearance. In an exclusive interview with CNN, Guerrero described the FBI agents' questions. ""They pretty much asked me if she was depressed, ... how she acted around the baby, if she seemed stressed out,"" Guerrero said. ""I told them she never looked depressed around me. You know, she always seemed to have a smile on her face when her kids were around."" Bradley and the girl's father, Jeremy Irwin, are friendly people who were thrilled to have a baby daughter, Guerrero said. ""When they're here, they're happy. They're smiling. They love their kids,"" she said. After two years chatting with Bradley in the checkout line at Festival Foods in Kansas City, Missouri, Guerrero said she had learned a lot about the family. ""We would just pretty much talk about what they've been doing, stuff like that; the children, her two sons, and then when she found out she was pregnant with Lisa, that's all we talked about,"" Guerrero said. The supermarket clerk said she also told FBI agents Lisa's parents never mentioned anyone wanting to harm them. ""From my interaction (with the parents), I really don't think that they have anything to do with this,"" she told CNN. Authorities had expressed frustration recently after Lisa's parents had stopped cooperating with investigators, police Capt. Steve Young said. However, a family spokeswoman for Bradley and father Jeremy Irwin attributed the frustration to ""miscommunication,"" and a subsequent meeting with the parents was held Saturday. On Tuesday, Irwin's family announced they had brought in a prominent private investigator to help with the search -- a high-profile twist in a case that has gripped national headlines. Flanked by family members wearing T-shirts with a picture of Lisa and the word ""Kidnapped"" above it, investigator Bill Stanton said Tuesday night that he wants a ""happy ending"" to the case. He told CNN a family friend was paying for his services. ""I will be asking questions,"" he added. ""I am here to seek the truth."" Stanton is a former New York City police officer who has served as a security consultant for several television networks. He said his role is to help ""coordinate and focus the family"" in both the investigation and in its dealings with the media. ""We are here to cooperate with anyone and everyone that will help us find the guilty party and return Lisa home safely,"" he said. Stanton said the family, which remains united and strong despite the ""tremendous hardship,"" will release more information soon. He did not elaborate. ""I know everybody's watching this family and watching this house, and that's fair,"" he said. ""Keep one eye on them, but also keep the other eye out on the streets, in every place. Because there is a bad guy out there, or bad people, with this child. And we want to get this child home safe and sound."" Lisa was last seen around 10:30 p.m. October 3, asleep in her crib, police said. Authorities were called to the home about 4 a.m. October 4. She turned 11 months old Tuesday, the eighth day of the search. On Tuesday, authorities focused on an abandoned home about a half mile from the Irwin home, and included an inspection of a well in the backyard of the property. The search did not yield any evidence, police said. Authorities had previously combed a nearby landfill and creek. ""It appears the suspect entered/exited through a bedroom window,"" authorities said in a statement. ""Evidence at the scene leads police to believe the child has been abducted."" Lisa's father, Jeremy Irwin, told reporters that he discovered the girl was missing when he got home from work. ""The front door was unlocked,"" he said last week. ""Most of the lights were on in the house, and the window in front was open -- all very unusual."" Three cell phones were also reported missing at the home, Young said. Lisa is described as 30 inches tall with blue eyes and blond hair, police said. She weighs between 26 and 30 pounds and was last seen wearing purple shorts and a purple shirt with white kittens on it. The missing girl has two bottom teeth and a ""beauty mark"" on her right outer thigh. She had a cold with a cough, police said. CNN's Bill Kirkos and Karan Olson contributed to this report.","NEW: Supermarket clerk: Mom of the missing baby never seemed depressed .

"Casablanca, Morocco (CNN) -- A moderate Islamist party claimed victory in Morocco's first parliamentary elections since constitutional reforms this summer. The Justice and Development Party (PJD) won 107 of the 395 seats, Interior Minister Taib Cherkaoui said Sunday. The next biggest winner was the Istiqlal Party, also known as the Independence Party, with 60 seats, the Interior Ministry's website reported. The number of parties involved in Morocco's multiparty system means it was unlikely a single party would win a majority of the seats, so a coalition government would have to be formed. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton offered her congratulations Saturday ""on the successful completion"" of the elections. ""The United States stands ready to work with the new parliament and the people of Morocco to strengthen the rule of law, raise human rights standards, promote transparent and accountable governance, and work toward sustained, democratic reform,"" she said. Turnout in the North African country was 45%, the Interior Ministry said Friday. The National Democratic Institute -- which had 41 accredited observers from 21 countries that went to over 200 polling stations on Friday -- said in a news release that the elections ""were conducted transparently."" The voting process was described as ""technically sound"" and ""without fear of tampering or procedural violations."" But one institute member, Canadian Liberal Party leader Bob Rae, also pointed to the turnout and a number of invalid and spoiled ballots as negatives. ""Seeing the number of people who actively spoiled their ballots as well as those who did not participate, it is clear that the path to real change will take more effort and time,"" Rae said. Lise Storm, senior lecturer in Middle East Politics at the University of Exeter in England, said Friday that the outcome might signal whether the population is happy with the monarchy or not. The more votes for the PJD appear to indicate a desire for greater change, she said -- as opposed to votes for the bloc of traditional loyalist parties, which would suggest voters favor the status quo. Under the new constitution, approved by referendum in July, both Parliament and the prime minister have greater powers, while the monarch's sway has been slightly lessened. The changes mean the prime minister must now be chosen from the party that wins the greatest number of votes -- which, based on the preliminary results, would be the Justice and Development Party -- rather than King Mohammed VI selecting his own nominee for the job. The reforms came after thousands of Moroccans took to the streets to demonstrate earlier this year, inspired by what became known as the Arab Spring. The youth-based February 20 Movement called for jobs and an end to corruption its members say stems from royal cronies. Analysts say economic reform is needed to create more jobs for the country's young people, particularly many university graduates who are unemployed. Journalist Aida Alami contributed to this report.","The Islamist Justice and Development Party wins more seats than any other party .

"(CNN) -- Former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will begin chemotherapy in the coming days to treat a malignant tumor in his larynx, a hospital official said Saturday. Lula, 66, will be treated at Sao Paulo's Syrian-Lebanese Hospital, said hospital spokeswoman Mirtes Bogea. It is not clear what day the treatment will begin. He was diagnosed Saturday morning after undergoing medical examinations, Bogea said. ""This is a localized tumor,"" noted Bogea, meaning that it has not spread elsewhere in the body. She added that the tumor has not metastasized, a characteristic of most cancerous cells. Finance Minister Guido Mantega told reporters that he attended Lula's birthday party last week and noticed that his voice sounded hoarse. ""But since he has been traveling a lot and delivering speeches, we all thought it was normal,"" he told CNN affiliate Rede Record TV. On Saturday, Mantega predicted Lula would beat cancer. He noted that former first lady Marisa Leticia has been with Lula ever since he came to the hospital for a check-up on Friday. ""He is a fighter,"" Mantega told reporters, adding he expected Lula will leave the hospital later Saturday. ""He has overcome lesser obstacles and will overcome this one as well."" Raul Cutait, one of the doctors treating the former president told Rede Record TV that Lula appears well. He said it is also likely that therapy will begin early next week. Sao Paulo's Syrian-Lebanese hospital is considered one of the region's top cancer treatment centers. Founded in 1921 by Syrian and Lebanese immigrants, the facility's staff has also treated Paraguay's President Fernando Lugo and former Brazilian Vice President Jose Alencar, who died in March after a long battle against abdominal cancer. Its patients also include current Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff -- Lula's handpicked successor and is the first woman to hold the presidency -- who was treated in 2005 for lymphoma. Rousseff said on her Twitter account that she'd spoken to Lula's wife, and in a press release issued Saturday wished her predecessor a ""fast recovery."" ""As you all know, I went through the same thing, with the competent team of the Syrian-Lebanese hospital, which allowed me to completely recover,"" she said. ""I am sure the same thing will happen to President Lula."" Lula, who rose from a childhood of poverty to become a union leader, won elections in 2002 to become Brazil's first working-class president. He is widely credited with helping steer the nation into becoming an economic powerhouse, leaving office last year with high approval ratings. Presidents, however, are barred from running for a third consecutive term. When Lula turned 66 years-old last Thursday, he addressed the Brazilian public via the Internet, saying that he had dedicated more than half his half to improving Brazil's democracy. ""The cake is not one of the biggest cakes,"" he said, with a wink, during a speech. ""But I hope to give to all of you a tiny bite.""","NEW: Brazil's finance minister says Lula is ""a fighter"" and will beat cancer .

"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Northern Ireland's Martin McGuinness will be the Sinn Fein candidate for president of the Republic of Ireland when elections are held next month, the party's executive committee voted unanimously Sunday. McGuinness, a former leader of the IRA, is now deputy first minister of Northern Ireland. Accepting his party's nomination Sunday, he said republicans have an obligation to ""heal the wounds of their actions."" McGuinness has admitted that he was a leader of the Provisional IRA during the 30-year conflict in Northern Ireland between pro-British and pro-Irish forces. In recent years, he has received death threats from hardline dissident IRA splinter groups because of his support for the peace process. He referred to a recent upsurge in violence in the province in his speech Sunday. ""I know there will be a very strong temptation for people to drag us back to the past. God knows there are enough of them trying to do so, in a violent sense, at the moment,"" he said. He described himself as a man of peace who can work across sectarian lines. ""People see me very much as a peacemaker, but, more importantly, they see me as a peacemaker who can be trusted,"" he said. ""I have every confidence that the peace process will be strengthened by my participation in the presidential election."" ""I am proud to have served in government alongside unionists,"" he said, referring to those who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom rather than uniting with the republic to the south.  ""I can work with anyone. Times have changed in the North."" Sinn Fein won 14 seats in the Irish parliament, the Dail Eireann, in elections this year. The party's leader, Gerry Adams, moved from his west Belfast constituency in Northern Ireland to win a parliamentary seat in the republic, topping the poll in the Louth constituency. McGuinness will step down temporarily as deputy first minister in Northern Ireland's power-sharing government during the election campaign, to be replaced by Education Minister John O'Dowd, Sinn Fein said. If elected, he would resign from his position in Northern Ireland. Ireland's president is a largely ceremonial role, with national elections held every seven years. The president is the guardian of the constitution and has the power to refer contentious laws to Ireland's Supreme Court. Mary McAleese has been the president since 1997 and is nearing the end of her second term of office. McAleese hosted a historic visit to Ireland by Britain's Queen Elizabeth II in May, days before U.S. President Barack Obama arrived in the country. Elections are due to be held October 27. On Friday, Irish Senator David Norris said he intends to re-enter the race. Norris -- previously tipped to be the first openly gay president of Ireland -- withdrew from the contest August 2. He abandoned his bid after it emerged he had made a plea for clemency for a former lover convicted of the statutory rape of a 15-year-old Palestinian boy in Israel in the 1990s. However, Norris told Irish television Friday night he had changed his mind and is seeking support to relaunch his campaign following a ""consistent outpouring"" of public support. He now has to secure political nominations to get his name on the presidential ballot paper. An opinion poll published Sunday showed Labour's Michael D. Higgins leading Norris, who might be backed by the Fianna Fail party. But the Sunday Independent/Millward Brown Lansdowne poll was completed before Norris said he was rejoining the race and before Sinn Fein put McGuinness' name forward.","The former IRA leader says republicans have a responsibility to heal wounds .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Russia's Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has confirmed Russia is close to sealing an energy supply agreement with China worth $1 trillion. ""It's fair to say that we're very close to reach an agreement on the natural gas deal,"" Putin told the journalists at a joint press conference after meeting with Chinese counterpart Wen Jiabao. Putin arrived in Beijing on Tuesday for a two-day visit. He also met with President Hu Jintao and other Chinese leaders on Wednesday. The negotiations over the natural gas supply had stalled for more than a year due to disagreements over price. If an agreement can be reached, the deal would see Russia supply China with up to 68 billion cubic meters of gas every year. ""The trade volume will increase significantly, and this will change the fact that the economic cooperation between the two countries lags behind the political cooperation,"" said Zhao Huasheng, director of the Center for Russia and Central Asia Studies at Fudan University. ""Together with cooperation in other economic fields, China and Russia will become real strategic partners in economic terms,"" he added. Recent years have seen a steady increase in trade between the two countries. According to the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, bilateral trade volume in the year to July increased by 37.4% to a record $42.2 billion. The ministry forecasts that this will reach a new record in 2011-- possibly in excess of $70 billion. ""The economic and trade cooperation between the two countries has reached to an unprecedented level,"" Putin said in an interview with the state-run Xinhua agency. But energy cooperation stands out as the main focus between Russia, a major energy exporter, and China, the world's biggest energy consumer, according to a 2010 report from the International Energy Agency. Putin has also brought along a group of 160 Russian business leaders for the visit, including the CEOs of Russian energy giants Gazprom, Rosneft and aluminum producer UC RUSAL. During Putin's visit, Chinese Vice Premier Wang Qishan also met with Russian Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin to discuss energy needs. ""We're discussing opening new energy transportation routes,"" explained Putin at the joint press conference. On January 2011, China and Russia opened an oil pipeline from Daqing, northeast China, to Skovorodino in eastern Russia. The line is 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) and aims to provide 15 million metric tons of oil annually to China.","Russian PM: Russia, China close to agreement on a $1 trillion natural gas deal .

"(CNN) -- An 11th person has died because of injuries sustained in the crash Friday at an air race at Reno, Nevada, an official with the Washoe County Medical Examiner's Office said Tuesday. No details about this latest victim were released. The official, Michelle Anderson, said there would be a news conference revealing more information late Tuesday. Authorities have so far identified seven people who died from the crash. The list includes the pilot, 74-year-old Jimmy Leeward, who lost control of his vintage plane before it plummeted into a crowd of spectators. He and six others were killed on the tarmac, while four have now died at hospitals. The six others identified are Joseph Wogan, 22, of Arizona; George and Wendy Hewitt of Washington state; Regina Bynum, 53, of Texas; Sharon Stewart, 47, of Nevada; and Gregory Morcom, 47, from Washington state. Almost 70 people were injured in the crash. Five patients remained hospitalized Tuesday at Saint Mary's Regional Medical Center, four in serious condition and one in fair condition, the hospital said in a statement. Investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board announced Sunday that the World War II-era plane was equipped with data and video recording devices that they hope to use to help determine what happened and why. NTSB member Mark Rosekind described the devices, as well as the discovery of information and pieces that may have come from the devices, as ""significant new information."" It was also not entirely expected, given the relatively small size and nature of the P-51 aircraft. ""I'm not aware of a lot of aircraft having it; this is the first one I came across,"" said Howard Plagens, the NTSB official heading the investigation. Plagens was referring to a ""box"" that recorded key variables such as altitude, latitude and oil pressure. In addition, there was an outward-facing video camera on the plane, according to Rosekind. Several memory cards have been found at the wreckage site that may have come from either device and will be sent to the NTSB laboratory in Washington for a full analysis, Rosekind said. They may belong to some of the 200,000 spectators who were at the annual National Championship Air Races and Air Show. Investigators do have a copy of the ""box"" data, since it was sent in real time by telemetry to sources outside the aircraft. Besides the cards, Rosekind said, parts of a plane's tail, an ""elevator trim tab"" and video camera fragments have been found. ""There were thousands of pieces of debris,"" Plagens said, explaining how the site had been laid out in a grid system to help organize the investigation. As with the memory cards, one of the authorities' first goals will be to determine whether these came from the plane. Countering earlier reports, Rosekind said Sunday that Leeward did not send a ""Mayday call,"" indicating he was in distress. Investigators have repeatedly stated that it is not known why the aircraft nosedived. Some speculation has surrounded the elevator trim tab, which was breaking apart prior to the crash, a photograph shows. Investigators also will pore over ""a tremendous (amount of) video that was captured"" at the scene, according to Rosekind. A preliminary report will be available Friday, but Rosekind has said the full investigation could take six to nine months. ""It's not just what happened, it's why it happened,"" he said Sunday. ""(We're) trying to make sure this doesn't happen again.""","NEW: Five people remain hospitalized, four in serious condition .

"(CNN) -- Whoever came up with the phrase ""location is everything"" when it comes to real estate must have had Malta in mind. This tiny island nation sits in the middle of the Mediterranean, about 60 miles south of Sicily and 180 miles east of the African coast at Tunisia. The result is that anyone who was anyone visited, settled, invaded or conquered this prime piece of land. And with each leaving their mark, a visit to Malta is truly a journey through the region's history. The Republic of Malta is actually three islands. The country's name comes from the largest of the three; to the northwest of that is Gozo, and in between them is Comino. And tiny really means tiny. At only 122 square miles (316 square kilometers), the total area of the country is about one-tenth the size of Rhode Island, by far the smallest of the United States. London, New York, Tokyo -- each of these metropolitan areas is bigger than Malta. That compactness, coupled with an extensive bus system, lets you see the best of what it has to offer with ease. Begin your journey through the millennia with the stone temples at Ħaġar Qim and Mnajdra, on the southern coast. Construction on these sites started around 3600 BC, making them centuries older than the best guesses we have for England's Stonehenge. And the temples are every bit as mysterious, since it is not clear how or why they were built. The structures aren't as massive as their English counterpart, and they lack the graceful symmetry. Yet walk among the exposed chambers -- with the sea just beyond the cliffs -- and you know that the generations who built these temples believed they were constructing something for the ages. It is here that you start to get a sense of what sets a journey to Malta apart from Europe's more visited travel destinations. Ħaġar Qim and Mnajdra are just two of seven ancient temples that make up a UNESCO World Heritage site described by a leading prehistorian as ""the oldest free-standing monuments in the world."" These sites represent just one epoch of many you will find on your trip. Travel seven miles (11 kilometers) to the east -- and skip forward more than 2,000 years from the time the stones for those temples were laid -- and you will be standing where the first seafaring Phoenicians arrived on Malta from the eastern end of the Mediterranean. To this day the village of Marsaxlokk is a key port for the country's fishing industry, seen in the market held every Sunday and in the seafood restaurants lining the harbor. But look closely at the colorfully painted traditional fishing boats known as luzzu bobbing gently on the water, and you can't help but notice how they are still painted with the Eye of Osiris, a custom said to have been handed down by the Phoenicians to ward off evil. From Marsaxlokk head northwest 10 miles (16 kilometers) inland toward the walled city of Mdina, which sits on one of the highest plateaus on the island. Just outside the main gate of this walled city is the Domus Romana, or ""Roman house."" Here we have moved forward another thousand years to when Malta was part of the Roman Republic. The Roman House is a museum built on the excavated ruins of a nobleman's home, dating back to sometime shortly after 100 B.C. While the museum on the main floor houses a respectable collection of artifacts, it is the excavated floors of the villa -- among the finest mosaics uncovered anywhere in the former empire -- that will astonish you. As for Mdina itself, the city's name comes from the Arabic word simply meaning ""the city,"" which belies its status as the former capital of Malta. A millennium after our Roman nobleman walked across his tiled floors Malta was part of the Fatimid Caliphate -- a form of government based on the tenets of Islam -- that stretched across northern Africa and into the Arabian Peninsula. It was during this period that the moat and walls that surround Mdina were first constructed. With few vehicles permitted today inside its gates, a walk through the narrow stone alleys of Mdina makes it clear why it is known locally as ""the silent city."" For one of the best views anywhere on Malta, make your way to the upper terrace of the Fontanella Tea Garden restaurant. On a clear day over a cup of coffee you can see practically the entire island. While the island nation has changed hands countless times over the ages, the influence that is most widely felt in Malta today didn't come from an invading empire, but from a group known as the Knights Hospitallers, later the Knights of Malta. This order was first set up to run a hospital in Jerusalem for pilgrims who traveled there and eventually developed into a religious and military order. When Islamic forces pushed them out in 1291, the Knights re-established themselves first in Cyprus and then in Rhodes before arriving on Malta in the 16th century. It was in those first decades on the island that the Knights of Malta built the current capital, Valletta, following an unsuccessful siege by Ottoman forces. With its impenetrable stone walls and regular battle towers surrounding a regular grid of streets, the entire city stands as tribute to the order's military and engineering prowess. Within the battlements, the interiors of churches such as St John's Co-Cathedral, completed in 1577, are among the most ornate that you will find anywhere. These monuments, like those reaching back into prehistory, outlasted both their creators and those who followed to lay their own claim to Malta. The Knights were forced out by the French, when Napoleon invaded in 1798, who were expelled a couple years later by the British. World War II saw a failed attempt by Axis powers to bomb the country into submission. Independence came in 1964. Today Malta, still as staunchly Catholic as it was under the Knights, is content to take its place as part of the European Union. A trip to Malta is not merely a walk through a living history book. Along the way are stunning natural formations, like the Blue Grotto on the southern coast near the village of Żurrieq. When the weather permits and seas are not too choppy, boats take visitors to the 140-foot-high natural stone arch and surrounding caves. Of course, on an island this small you are never far from the coast, though sun seekers often head to the beaches of the northern resort of Mellieħa to soak in the rays. The cafés and wine bars of modern-day Valletta make you feel like you're in southern Italy, as will much of the cuisine. The nightlife at the clubs in St. Julian's, just north of Valletta, can hold its own against just about anything the rest of Europe has to offer. Prices for hotels and restaurants overall are less than on mainland Europe, especially in the off-season, and the bus system on Malta makes getting around simple and affordable. Full-day tickets are only €1.50 (about $2.) You can get pretty much anywhere from the main terminal just outside the Valletta city gate. No matter where you go and what you see, Malta's unique spot -- in the Mediterranean and in history -- is felt everywhere.","The island nation of Malta blends thousands of years of culture .

"(EW.com) -- ""True Blood"" fans are still reeling from last night's epic and bloody season finale. SPOILER ALERT! We saw the returns of Grands (Lois Smith) and Rene (Michael Raymond-James), as well as possibly the resurrection of Russell (Denis O'Hare). But the most disturbing twists were Lafayette (Nelsan Ellis) stabbing Jesus (Kevin Alejandro), and Tara (Rutina Wesley) getting shot in the head by Debbie Pelt (Britt Morgan). EW talked to Wesley about the finale and whether or not Tara survived the gunshot wound. What did you think when you read the season finale script? Well I mean, I knew ahead of time that it was coming. It's always a scary place as an actor to go there. I don't know what their plans are for next season. I know that Alan has said there are ""big plans,"" but I don't know what that really means, and things can always change. I'm not for sure, but I trust him completely. At the end of the day, it's hard to see how I'm coming back, seeing as half of my head was just blown off. I don't know. They may figure something out. I mean it's True Blood. There's always flashbacks. There's phantasms. There's all this crazy stuff. It's very possible. But I'm excited either way. If it does all end, I've had the most amazing time of my life. It's really great. In your mind, is Tara dead? Well I mean half my head is missing. I'm just gonna keep saying that. You know, it's ""True Blood."" I feel like anything is possible. If anything, it is the golden hour though. If she is able to be saved, it's like she's got 20 seconds. It's not a lot of time. I'm curious to see what they're going to do with all of it. I hope I'm back. But again half my head is missing [laughs]. Maybe Tara will just wear a lot of hats? Yeah I mean yeah she can wear a lot of hats. Put some gauze on it. But people are going crazy! [Laughs] . It was crazy! Are people approaching you? Well my phone has been blowing up. I talked to Nelsan and his phone was blowing up. He was like, ""People are about to start a riot over you."" I think that's so sweet to know that people out there are really upset and some people are like, ""I'm not watching the show anymore!"" I'm like, C'mon guys. But it's not over. It ain't over til the fat lady sings. I'm just gonna take it one day at a time. As I said, I haven't seen any scripts from next season, but I know that I'm involved -- I just don't know in what way. Are you signed on for a season 5? Yeah. It's out there that Alan has already said that he has big plans for Tara. But things change. I don't know exactly what they have in store for me and how long that will be. It's tricky. And if I did know, I'm just not going to say. [Laughs] But again -- half the head is missing. The cool part is people are talking. And that's the question is: Is she dead or is she not? Because people can survive head wounds. But we have people on the show that can make things happen -- you know what I mean? I don't know what's going to happen the first episode of next season. I'm just as excited and curious you are. I hope it's good. I hope I stick around for a while. That would be nice. [Laughs] . Was it emotional shooting that scene on the kitchen floor? It was emotional. I think we all went out afterwards -- me, Britt and Anna -- just to sort of have a little celebration. But it was very very emotional. I don't think there was a dry eye when we shot that scene. It's very clear the relationship when Tara goes, ""I would die for you."" Basically, I would take a bullet for you. That's not necessarily a best friend -- she's like my sister. I think it was so amazing to see that. To see her walk in and go, ""Oh, uh-uh."" That goes to show you how much love Tara has. Anna in that moment I think played it so beautifully, and it was hard for me because I was like, ""Okay, play dead. Play dead.""

"(CNN) -- A central Maine police chief said Friday that authorities now believe there was ""foul play"" in the disappearance two weeks ago of a 20-month-old girl. Ayla Reynolds was last seen December 16 when her father, Justin Dipietro, said he put her to bed. Dipietro -- who has insisted that he has ""no idea what happened to Ayla"" -- later reported the girl missing. Waterville Police Chief Joseph Massey previously has said authorities were confident that someone took Ayla from the house. But in his comments Friday, issued in a statement, Massey went a step further in saying the case ""has evolved from the search for a missing child to a criminal investigation."" Given this shift, the Maine State Police will now take over as the lead in the investigation from Waterville police, according to Massey. ""We base our conclusions on evidence gathered by investigators during the past two weeks,"" the police chief said. Maine state police did not respond immediately to a call Friday from CNN seeking comment on their new role in the investigation. Jessica Reynolds, the missing girl's aunt, told CNN on Friday that authorities said they ""can't tell us right now"" about what evidence spurred the change, claiming they were told ""it isn't done being processed."" ""We believed from the beginning that Ayla didn't walk out (of the house) on her own,"" Reynolds said. ""Why it took 14 days for police to say this, I don't understand. ""Time is ticking. The statistics may be that she's not going to come home alive, but, there's also a chance that whoever has her will bring her back safely ... Whoever has her will be found eventually."" Police said Wednesday they had received 370 leads, and Massey said Friday that investigators and searchers had spent ""many thousands of hours looking for Ayla (and) evaluating evidence."" A $30,000 reward -- coming from anonymous private citizens and business leaders -- was offered earlier this week for information that leads investigators to the girl. Ayla is described as having blond hair, being about 2 feet, 9 inches tall, and weighing 30 pounds. She was last seen wearing green pajamas with white polka dots and the words ""Daddy's Princess"" across the front. When she disappeared, the girl had her arm in a soft cast. The toddler's mother, Trista Reynolds, told HLN's Nancy Grace that she'd raised Ayla for 18 months and Dipietro became involved after ""I needed to go and get a little bit of help for myself."" She told HLN she underwent rehab. The father had sole custody of the girl when she disappeared. On December 15, the day before Ayla went missing, Reynolds filed a complaint seeking sole custody. The 23-year-old mother told HLN she didn't tell Dipietro she was going to court because he was ""vindictive"" and ""verbally abusive."" For his part, Dipietro, 24, has said he would never do anything to hurt Ayla. ""I have to believe that Ayla is with somebody, and I just want that person to find the courage to do the right thing and find a way to return her safely,"" the father said in his statement Wednesday. ""The truth is the truth and when the case is solved it will be out there. Until then, please try to remain positive and hopeful as I remain confident that Ayla will return safely."" Jessica Reynolds said Friday that she and her sister, Trista, are frantic in their efforts to find Ayla. ""She's extremely intelligent,"" she said of her niece. ""She makes everybody smile when they see a smile on her face.""

"(CNN) -- 10-man Manchester City were held to a 1-1 draw by Liverpool at Anfield Sunday but have a five-point lead the top of the English Premier League. City were forced to play the closing moments a man short after second half substitute Mario Balotelli was shown red for a second bookable offence. It nearly proved costly as Liverpool's late substitute Andy Carroll saw his header brilliantly saved by City goalkeeper Joe Hart. It preserved his side's unbeaten start to the EPL season and they have 35 points from 13 games, leaving city rivals and defending champions Manchester United trailing in second spot. Tottenham Hotspur, who won 3-1 at WBA Saturday, are seven points adrift but have played a game less. Wales manager Gary Speed found dead at home . Vincent Kompany headed the leaders in front from a David Silva corner in the first half, but Liverpool were soon level as a Charlie Adam shot took a huge deflection off Joleon Lescott for an own-goal that left Hart wrong-footed. Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish was delighted by his team's performance as they stretched their unbeaten run to 10 games to stay in a challenging sixth spot. ""I don't think you could have asked for much more in terms of effort and commitment from the players. I think they were fantastic,"" he told Sky Sports. Swansea and Aston Villa played to a goalless draw in Sunday's other EPL game, both of which were overshadowed by the tragic death of Wales manager Gary Speed. In Germany's Bundesliga, there was a shock 3-2 defeat for Bayern Munich at Mainz Sunday, a result which leaves the Bavarian giants third in the table with reigning champions Borussia Dortmund on top. A draw for Bayern would have seen them return to the summit but they were always struggling once Austrian midfielder Andreas Ivanschitz put Mainz ahead after 11 minutes. Bayern defender Daniel van Buyten equalized on 56 minutes, but Mainz took a two-goal lead as Marco Caligiuri and defender Niko Bungert scored. Van Buyten then grabbed his second, but Bayern could not salvage a point. In Italy's Serie A, Luc Castaignos scored a late winner as Inter Milan continued their revival with a 1-0 win at Siena. Following their 2-1 home win over Cagliari last weekend, it lifted Claudio Ranieri's men to 14 points, but just one win adrift from sixth-placed Roma.","Manchester City held 1-1 at Liverpool in the English Premier League .

"New York (CNN) -- Work on the National September 11 Memorial Museum has been halted over a budgetary dispute, delaying its opening, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said. ""There's no chance of it being open on time. Work has basically stopped,"" Bloomberg said during a press conference Thursday. The museum was scheduled to open on the 11th anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks. Bloomberg blamed the holdup on ""disagreements"" with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which is responsible for a portion of the project's financing. ""The Port Authority has to spend money to do the infrastructure that they agreed to,"" the mayor said. ""We have a legitimate claim against the Port Authority for delays for roughly $140 million dollars which has increased our cost."" Bloomberg did not specify when work on the museum halted. The Port Authority did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bloomberg's disclosure of the setback came the same day the National September 11 Memorial & Museum Foundation announced that more than a million people have visited the site since it opened on the 10th anniversary of the attacks. The memorial features two large reflecting pools in the footprints of the two towers. Located underground in the former World Trade Center's ""archaeological heart,"" the museum will feature 110,000 square feet of exhibition space, according to the website for The National September 11 Memorial & Museum foundation. It will house a vast array of 9/11 artifacts, including ""photographs, videotapes, voice messages, recovered property, clothing and other personal effects, workplace memorabilia, [and] incident-specific documents,"" among other items. Bloomberg sounded a note of optimism, telling reporters that both sides would come to ""some agreement pretty soon."" He also said he thought the disagreement would not require judges to resolve it.

"(CNN) -- If presidential hopeful Rick Perry should awaken one night in a cold sweat with the Ghost of Republican Past hovering by his bedside, the apparition will likely take the form of Sen. Charles Percy, who passed away on Saturday after a long struggle with Alzheimer's disease. Percy's political career ended when he lost his Illinois Senate seat in 1984, the same year that future Texas Gov. Rick Perry won his first election to the Texas House of Representatives as a Democrat. Charles Percy's fall from GOP wunderkind to party outcast offers a vivid illustration of the Republican Party's mutation from a vibrant and diverse coalition to the dogmatic cult of conservative ideology that it has become today. In 1968, political gossips buzzed about the possibility that the rich, handsome, ""All-American"" Charles Percy might run for president. The New York Times called him ""the hottest political article in the Republican Party,"" and Richard Nixon worried that Percy would be his most formidable competitor in the primaries. Percy was a moderate-to-liberal Republican from the Rockefeller wing of the party who had made his name promoting affordable housing and combating urban poverty. Such positions were seen as positive political attributes in 1968. Four years earlier, Barry Goldwater's libertarian presidential campaign had proved a disaster, and Republicans were not eager to repeat the experience. But Percy chose not to run and instead endorsed his colleague Nelson Rockefeller, who lost to Richard Nixon. Over the next few years, Percy clashed frequently with Nixon over defense spending and Supreme Court appointments. During the Watergate scandal, he again defied Nixon by demanding an independent investigation. With his popularity and national name-recognition peaking, Percy might have had another shot at the presidency in 1976, but he deferred to the incumbent, Gerald Ford. There would not be another chance, for the Republican Party was moving away from Charles Percy. In the mid-1970s, a group of conservative insurgents known as the New Right began plotting to extinguish the party's liberal wing. They despised men such as Percy and embraced a fanatical brand of social conservatism. One of their leaders, Paul Weyrich, founded the Heritage Foundation and recruited Jerry Falwell to lead the Moral Majority. One by one, the New Right knocked off the liberal Republicans, either by defeating them in primaries or fatally weakening them in general elections -- names now barely remembered such as Clifford Case of New Jersey or Edward Brooke of Massachusetts. In 1984, New Right leaders backed a primary challenge against Percy. When that failed, they endorsed his Democratic challenger, the liberal, bow-tie wearing Paul Simon. One of the leaders, Richard Viguerie, explained that Percy's defeat was more important to conservatives than retaining Republican control of the Senate. When the voting was over, the Republicans kept the Senate, but they lost Charles Percy. The drive for ideological purity has continued ever since, with tea party groups and fundraisers such as the Club for Growth targeting moderate conservatives after the liberals went extinct. In recent years, they helped force out Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island and Charlie Crist of Florida. Perry, the front-runner of the Republican presidential field in polls, is a deep social and fiscal conservative who would never have had a shot at the presidential nomination in 1968. But in 2012, it's the liberal Charles Percy who wouldn't have stood a chance. Even Goldwater's refusal to embrace the religious right would doom his candidacy were he to run today. Yet perhaps Perry would still be wise to pay attention to the Ghost of Republican Past. He might get to see the old Democratic Party advertisement showing a disembodied pair of hands ripping apart a Social Security card. That advertisement helped turn the tide against Goldwater, who like Perry had challenged Social Security. Conservative activists have succeeded in driving American politics far to the right, but there may still be limits. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Michael Wolraich.","Michael Wolraich: In 1968, Charles Percy was a rising GOP star who fought urban poverty, Nixon .

"(CNN) -- FIFA president Sepp Blatter claimed on Wednesday he has apologized enough for remarks he made last week regarding on-field racism in football, with the Swiss saying he now considers the matter ""closed."" The head of world soccer's governing body was heavily criticized for comments he made in an interview with CNN, where he suggested racism between players on the pitch could be settled with a handshake. Blatter, speaking at the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) headquarters in Malaysia, reaffirmed his stance against discrimination, saying he was hurt by the accusations which were leveled against him. ""I can only say this item for me is closed,"" the 75-year-old told a press conference. ""There is no tolerance (of) racism. I have been interpreted as such and I have made my apologies. I cannot say anything more. ""There is no discrimination in my feelings, there is no racism, nothing at all. This matter for me is over. We go forward. There is zero tolerance (for) racism, zero tolerance (for) discrimination in all activities in the field of play and outside the field. ""[I was] very much hurt by these comments because it touched me in my conscience and my determination to go against racism."" It has been a turbulent 18 months for FIFA, with allegations of bribery and corruption surrounding the presidential election which saw Blatter voted in unopposed for a fourth term as the organization's chief in June. Former AFC head Mohammad Bin Hammam was due to be one of Blatter's opponents in the ballot, but the Qatari has since received a lifetime ban from football for alleged corruption during his presidential campaign. Bin Hammam is challenging his ban in the Court of Arbitration for Sport and Blatter declined to comment on whether there was a way back into FIFA for the former executive committee member. ""We will wait for the outcome of the next step,"" said Blatter.","Sepp Blatter has said he considers the recent racism controversy closed .

"(CNN) -- Tribal rivalries, an east-west divide, a rebel leadership lacking coherence, a shattered economy and the absence of a ""civil society"" -- these are just a few of the challenges that a post-Gadhafi Libya will face. The rebel National Transitional Council is aware of the perils ahead and has produced a blueprint for the immediate aftermath of Gadhafi's downfall and for a political process leading to democratic elections. Haunted by the lack of planning in Iraq after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, the international community -- in the shape of the Libyan Contact Group -- has urged the NTC to pursue reconciliation. In a statement Sunday night, President Barack Obama called on the NTC to pursue ""a transition to democracy that is just and inclusive for all of the people of Libya."" But that is no simple formula in a society riven by deep-seated rivalries and with no experience of democracy. In 42 years as Libyan leader, Moammar Gadhafi purged Libyan society of any alternative voice or real discourse. His Revolutionary Committees were ubiquitous, silencing dissent and enforcing the eccentric orthodoxy of the ""Brother Leader's"" teachings. In such a warped society, there has been little space for the emergence of a professional, qualified middle-class, and none for trade unions, opposition groups or other symbols of civil society. The only organized group not tied to the regime was the Muslim Brotherhood, driven underground by Gadhafi. As in Iraq in 2003 or Syria now, there is no recognized opposition figure or group that transcends tribal, regional and sectarian rifts. Gadhafi survived as long as he did, according to Libyan scholar Mansour O. El-Kikhia, by breaking up the power bases of Libya's largest and most influential tribes. Lands and influence were redistributed to more ""dependable"" tribes such as the Warfalla, Qadhadfa and Megarha. Places like Gadhafi's hometown -- Sirte -- received more resources than those regarded as less loyal. But tribal loyalties have survived and perhaps become more important in the absence of other political institutions. Eastern Libya -- where the rebellion began and is still based -- has long been at odds with the west, Gadhafi's power base. The pattern of the past six months' conflict suggests that geographical divide persists. Tribes in the west may not take kindly to the sudden dominance of a movement that began in the east. The rebel leadership in Benghazi has tried to co-ordinate with the rebellion in the west -- which began in the Nafusa Mountains and in some ways has been more effective on the battlefield -- but has not directed or controlled it. Libya is a vast country -- 1.75 million square kilometers - with many ""under-governed"" spaces, especially in the immense Sahara. In neighboring states such as Chad, Algeria and Niger, these are the spaces claimed by revolts and more recently by Islamist groups professing allegiance to al Qaeda. Gadhafi had his own problems with Islamic extremism -- the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group was one of the most effective groups sympathetic to al Qaeda before its leaders turned against jihad in return for a mass release from Libyan jails. Towns in eastern Libya became well-known for supplying fighters to the insurgency in Iraq, though the rebel leadership insists Gadhafi has exaggerated the threat of Islamist extremism for his own ends. Then there is the resurgent Berber identity in the western mountains. Gadhafi persecuted the Berbers, a non-Arab minority -- even accusing them of being agents of the CIA. But in the months since his forces have lost control of the Nafusa Mountains, the Berbers have re-established their language (Tamazight), their culture and even their flag. They are determined not to be subjugated again. The Berber Institute for Civil Society issued a statement this weekend setting out the community's demands: ""Tamazight should be recognised in the Constitution in all its dimensions ... This is a prerequisite of the Amazigh movement."" Libya's oil wealth has been a curse as well as a blessing. It has allowed lavish spending on education (with thousands of students sent to universities overseas) and infrastructure, and government subsidies have made staples affordable for millions. But there's been virtually no diversification of the economy; about 95% of the Libyan state's revenues derive from hydrocarbons. Unemployment probably exceeds 30% and half the population is under the age of 15. The civil service is thought to employ about one in five Libyans. Gadhafi built up a byzantine bureaucracy, but not one known for its efficiency. The adage among Libyans is ""Inshallah, bokra, moumken,"" which means ""With the will of God, tomorrow, maybe."" Nor is there much entrepreneurial spirit. Much of the hard work -- building railroads, servicing oil installations -- has been done by economic migrants and contract workers -- and hundreds of thousands of them fled when the fighting began. But Libya has advantages. About 80% of its people are literate; electricity is connected to almost the whole country. Economists say there are long-term opportunities -- Libyan oil is plentiful and low in sulphur -- if new industries can be built and a work ethic encouraged. Much also depends on whether opposition figures like Ali Tarhouni, who taught at the University of Washington State and holds the economic and oil portfolio, are given authority. But the immediate priorities, according to western diplomats, center on basic services: electricity, food, water and above all security -- priorities that were ignored in Iraq. British Foreign Secretary William Hague has urged the NTC to ensure that technocrats in the Libyan government are not purged. Libyan opposition officials envisage several thousand Arab troops -- possibly from the United Arab Emirates and Qatar -- being drafted into the capital to help stabilize what could be a chaotic situation. Saddam Hussein's fall was followed by an orgy of looting in Baghdad. How far the remnants of Gadhafi's army and police can be integrated into new security forces is a huge open question. But a template drawn up by the NTC's envoy in the Emirates, Aref Ali Nayed, includes detailed plans for keeping police units in uniform. Journalist Derek Flood of the Jamestown Foundation, who has recently been in the western mountains, told CNN that he witnessed police training programs under way. The rebels seem to be aware that a new security force imposed from the east would be a recipe for trouble. Much will depend on whether Gadhafi loyalists begin a campaign of sabotage after he has gone, much as Saddam Hussein's Baathists did. There are also plans for an airlift of humanitarian supplies and the rapid rehabilitation of the oil infrastructure, though industry experts say it will be some time before pre-war exports of 1.6 million barrels a day can be attained. Plans are one thing, but without an inclusive transition and transparency they will be quickly overwhelmed. For the more unscrupulous, there will be temptations to divert oil revenues to private accounts. The anti-corruption group Transparency International rates Libya 146th in its corruption perception index, close to the bottom of the league. The NTC lacks cohesion -- a hastily devised group of former regime figures, intellectuals, nationalists, secularists and Islamists. It has also shown disunity to a murderous degree -- witness the murky circumstances of the killing of military chief Abdel Fatah Younis last month. But it's now the only game in town and under its own transition plan will run Libya for the next eight months. Even the NTC's chairman, Mustafa Abdel Jalil, has described this option as the ""best of the worst."" Any collapse of authority in Libya would have grim implications for its neighbors -- especially Egypt and Tunisia. Libya has been a source of work for millions of other North Africans. But chaos in Libya would also worry Europe. It could become another route for the flow of drugs from Africa. Illegal immigration across the Mediterranean is already taxing Italy. And were Islamist extremists, such as al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, to gain a foothold, they would have ready access to Europe.","Tribal rivalries, an east-west divide and  a shattered economy are just a few of the challenges .

"(CNN) -- Xavi Hernandez scored the only goal of the game with a thunderous free kick as Barcelona beat nine-man Granada Tuesday to return to the top of La Liga. The Spanish champions, held 0-0 at home by Sevilla at the weekend, once again found goals hard to come by against their struggling opponents. But midfield ace Xavi did find the net with a long-range free kick on 32 minutes which flew into the top corner. At the start of the second half Granada's Jaime Romero was shown red, but despite dominating possession Barca could not grab a second, but they have gone seven games, a club record, without conceding a goal. In injury time, Granada's Daniel Benitez was also red carded after being cautioned for a second time. Barcelona can be overtaken at the top by perennial strugglers Levante, who go in search of a remarkable seventh straight win against Real Sociedad Wednesday. Real Madrid play Villarreal and can also leapfrog their arch-rivals with a win as Cristiano Ronaldo, on 98 goals for the club, aims to reach triple figures after his weekend hat-trick against Malaga. In Italy, Juventus went back to the top of Serie A after beating Fiorentina 2-1 in Turin Tuesday night. Udinese and Lazio are not playing until Wednesday as Juve took full advantage to regain the leadership they held until a 2-2 draw against Genoa Saturday. Leonardo Bonucci put them in front but Fiorentina hit back after the break and equalized through Stevan Jovetic. But Alessandro Matri grabbed the winner as Juve kept up their unbeaten start to the season. England's League Cup fourth round saw an immediate return to winning ways for Manchester United after their 6-1 defeat to Manchester City Sunday in the EPL. Making 11 changes to that team, Alex Ferguson's men beat fourth-flight Aldershot 3-0. Strikers Dimitar Berbatov and Michael Owen, who have been frozen out of league action, scored the opening two goals with Antonio Valencia getting the third. Arsenal also reached the last eight with a 2-1 home win over Bolton.","Barcelona beat Granada 1-0 to regain leadership of La Liga .

"(CNN) -- Maria Sharapova has pulled out of the season-ending WTA Championships in Istanbul after suffering successive straight-sets defeats. The Russian lost to China's Li Na 7-6 (7-4) 6-4, who had herself not won a match, or even a set, since August. It was a match that ebbed and flowed as Li came from 2-4 down in the first set to force a tie-break, which she won despite losing the first four points. Li, who this year became the first Asian Grand Slam winner after victory in the French Open, then fought off a late Sharapova surge when 5-2 up to take the second set 6-4. The defeat followed Sharapova's capitulation against U.S. Open champion Sam Stosur 6-1, 7-5 on Wednesday. ""I really wasn't thinking about too much during the match,"" Li was quoted as saying on the WTA's official website after the match. ""I'm so happy I was able to beat Maria because she's a top player, and also today was my first match ever at the Championships, so I want to thank all the crowd here for supporting me."" But for Sharapova, who has struggled with an ankle injury but had the chance to become world number one with victory in Istanbul, there were some positives to be taken from two defeats in two days. ""I just have to be pleased that I recovered quickly enough to allow myself a chance of playing here,"" she told AFP. World number one Caroline Wozniacki crashed to defeat in her second red group match, losing 6-2 4-6 6-3 to Russia's Vera Zvonareva. In a repeat of last year's semifinal, which Wozniacki won in straight sets, Zvonareva, 27, hit 49 winners to overpower her Danish opponent in two hours and 18 minutes. ""We always have tough matches and this one was very tough too, three sets as usual,"" Zvonareva said of the pair's first meeting since the final of the Qatar Open in February, which she won 6-4 6-4. Despite losing, Wozniacki, 21, is now guaranteed to finish the year at the top of the world rankings courtesy of Sharapova's withdrawal. Elsewhere fourth seed Victoria Azarenka carded a victory in her first match of the Championships with a 6-2 6-2 defeat of U.S. Open champion Sam Stosur. Azarenka has now won all five of the matches she has played against Australia's Stosur, sealing success on Wednesday in one hour and 17 minutes on her fourth match point. Stosur, seeded seventh, was broken four times in the match and will need to bounce back quickly in order to repeat her semifinal appearance at last year's tournament. Azarenka, eliminated at the group stage of the event in 2010, was delighted with her form in the match. ""I feel great,"" she told the WTA's official website after scoring a sixth straight-sets triumph in a row. ""I wasn't expecting to play so well in my first match here. It was getting close in the end, we had a really close last game. ""Sam started to really go for every shot with nothing to lose, and I backed up a little bit. She made some incredible shots. But I stayed strong. I had to work for it. I'm glad I finished it now.""","Maria Sharapova has quit the end-of-season WTA Championships in Istanbul .

"(CNN) -- Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was furious after his team's hopes of retaining the English Premier League title were dented by a controversial 1-1 draw with Newcastle on Saturday. Demba Ba's second-half penalty kept the visitors in fourth place despite having Jonas Gutierrez sent off with 11 minutes to play, and Manchester City can now move seven points clear at the top by winning at Liverpool on Sunday. Javier Hernandez put second-placed United ahead four minutes after the halftime break with a lucky goal when a volley by teammate Wayne Rooney hit visiting defender Steven Taylor and ricocheted into the net off the Mexico striker. Ba continued his hot scoring run, with the Senegalese striker netting his ninth league goal this season in the 64th minute as referee Mike Jones ruled that Rio Ferdinand fouled Hatem Ben Arfa -- but only after consulting with his linesman. Ferguson insisted the England defender had made a fair tackle. ""I think it was everyone's view, including the referee as he thought Rio won the ball because he gave the corner kick,"" the Scot told reporters. ""He let the assistant referee over-rule him. ""We had that situation a few weeks ago when the linesman gave a penalty kick for handball against Sunderland when it was obviously an opponent's hand."" United hit the woodwork through England winger Ashley Young after Argentina international Gutierrez was dismissed for a second booking. Tottenham retained third place after winning 3-1 at West Bromwich Albion as Emmanuel Adebayor followed up his double against Aston Villa with two more goals to put his side two points behind United. The on-loan striker canceled out Youssouf Mulumbu's early header when he was quickest to react after Ben Foster saved his 25th-minute penalty. Striker Jermain Defoe, handed a rare start in place of Rafael van der Vaart, put the London side ahead in the 81st minute after Adebayor helped put him clear with a backheel, then the Togo international sealed it in time added on from Gareth Bale's cross. Fifth-placed Chelsea bounced back from successive defeats to beat Wolverhampton 3-0 and relieve the pressure on manager Andre Villas-Boas. The Portuguese has had to defend himself with Chelsea well off the pace and battling to stay in Europe after losing to Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League in midweek. Captain John Terry headed the London side ahead in the seventh minute, while young striker Daniel Sturridge and Spain winger Juan Mata also scored before halftime to leave the visitors hovering above the relegation zone. Sixth-placed Arsenal failed to join Chelsea on 25 points after being held 1-1 by London rivals Fulham, who moved up to 15th. Thomas Vermaelen's 65th-minute own-goal gave Fulham hope of a first win at the Emirates, but the Belgium defender made amends by heading an equalizer with eight minutes to play from Theo Walcott's right-wing cross. Bolton remained third from bottom after a 2-0 home defeat by Everton. Bolton had David Wheater sent off after just 20 minutes before second-half goals from Belgium midfielder Marouane Fellaini and Greek forward Apostolos Vellios lifted the visitors up to eighth. Norwich moved up to ninth with a 2-1 win at home to fellow promoted side Queens Park Rangers, as substitute striker Grant Holt scored a close-range decider with 17 minutes to play. Russell Martin put Norwich ahead in the 15th minute but Luke Young leveled on the hour after Jamie Mackie's shot hit the post. Wigan moved off the bottom with a last-gasp 2-1 win at Sunderland, the club's second victory in 13 games. Franco di Santo profited from an injury-time error by former Manchester United defender Wes Brown, after Jordi Gomez's 44th-minute penalty had canceled out Sebastian Larsson's opener for the home side. The result left Blackburn at the foot of the table in seven points following a 3-1 defeat by Stoke in the early match. Goals from Rory Delap, Glenn Whelan and Peter Crouch helped the home side end a run of four defeats and move up to 12th.","Alex Ferguson criticizes referee after Manchester United's 1-1 draw with Newcastle .

"(CNN) -- Barcelona and Real Madrid have roared back to form ahead of next week's Champions League challenges, with the Spanish giants recording comfortable victories in La Liga on Saturday. Barca's title defense has been uncharactistically unconvincing so far, with last Tuesday's 2-2 draw with Valencia their second dropped points in four outings. But Pep Guardiola's team responded by crushing Atletico Madrid 5-0 on the day the club confirmed a historic five-year shirt sponsorship with a Qatari group and also banned smoking at the Camp Nou stadium. The Catalan club's financial problems have led members to accept 171 million euros ($230 million) from Qatar Sports Investment, with 697 out of 809 delegates voting to end a longstanding tradition of no commercial shirt endorsements. Having reported a loss of 9.3 million euros ($12 million) in 2010-11, the board has projected a 20.1 million euros ($27 million) profit for this season. Guardiola started with key defenders Carles Puyol and Gerard Pique on the bench against Atletico, ahead of Wednesday's Champions League trip to BATE Borisov of Belarus. The visitors' five-goal new striker Falcao was unable to take advantage -- but at the other end Argentine scoring machine Lionel Messi took his league tally to eight this season with a superb hat-trick. Tiago Mendes crashed an early shot off the Barca crossbar, but David Villa settled home nerves in the ninth minute and it was 2-0 six minutes later when Joao Miranda unluckily ricocheted a blocked shot from Messi into his own net. With rain pouring down, Messi notched his first of the night in typical style as he jinked into the box from the right flank and curled home at the near post in the 26th minute for his 190th goal in 278 games for Barca. Atletico held out until the final 12 minutes when Messi provided two more moments of solo artistry as Barca moved up to second in the table -- a point behind Real Betis, who travel to Getafe on Monday. The two-time world player of the year matched the efforts of Real Madrid rival Cristiano Ronaldo, who also netted a treble in the earlier 6-2 thrashing of Rayo Vallecano. Real's title challenge has also faltered, first with a 1-0 defeat by Levante and then the midweek 0-0 draw with Racing Santander, and Jose Mourinho's team suffered a horror start at home when Michu scored after just 14 seconds. Ronaldo leveled seven minutes before halftime after being set free on the counterattack by Kaka, and Gonzalo Higuain put Real ahead in injury-time with a simple finish after Sergio Ramos headed Xabi Alonso's freekick across the goal. Ronaldo made it 3-1 from the penalty spot when Kaka was fouled five minutes after the break, but Real were then reduced to 10 men when winger Angel Di Maria was sent off after being booked a second time for handball. Michu capitalized in the 54th minute with his second from a corner, stabbing a shot across the line despite keeper Iker Casillas' best efforts to drag it back out. Teenage defender Raphael Varane made it 4-2 in the 67th minute, with the 18-year-old Frenchman somehow volleying in a corner with the back of his foot. Karim Benzema drove in Real's fifth on 73 after a square pass from fellow substitute Mesut Ozil, whose first-half introduction in place of Lassana Diarra swung the match in Madrid's favor. Ronaldo completed his second hat-trick this season with six minutes to play, chipping in a penalty after being fouled. Real's third win in five outings lifted Mourinho's men into fourth place ahead of Tuesday's Champions League visit by Dutch side Ajax. In Saturday's other games, third-placed Sevilla joined Barcelona on 11 points with a 1-0 win at home to Valencia as striker Fredi Kanoute scored the only goal in the 18th minute. Valencia dropped to fifth behind Real Madrid on goal difference. Athletic Bilbao moved out of the bottom three with a 1-1 draw at home to Villarreal, with Brazilian striker Nilmar netting a second-half equalizer for the visitors.","Barcelona move up to second in Spain with 5-0 win at home to Atletico Madrid .

"(CNN) -- You can't get much more ""inside baseball"" than this: the story of how statisticians trump scouts when it comes to putting together a winning team. But thanks to a great script by Steve Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin, a quietly compelling performance from Brad Pitt and shrewd direction by Bennett Miller (""Capote""), ""Moneyball"" should appeal to audiences well beyond sports fans. It's one of the classiest movies of the year and a strong bet for a ribbon of Oscar nominations. Michael Lewis' book chronicled the 2002 season of the Oakland As, when general manager Billy Beane infuriated conventional wisdom by applying ""sabermetrics"" to squad selection. Because the Athletics couldn't compete with wealthier teams for the big hitters, he looked to a different set of criteria, and especially at on-base percentages. It didn't have to be pretty. If the As walked their way to the World Series, that would be just fine. There's a conventional revenge-of-the-underdogs scenario lurking beneath the surface: something like ""Major League"" and ""The Bad News Bears."" There's the catcher who is drafted in to play first base (Chris Pratt as Scott Hatteberg), the pitcher with the wacky arm (Casey Bond as Chad Bradford) and the star who spends too much time partying in Vegas (Nick Porrazzo as Jeremy Giambi). Mostly, though, ""Moneyball"" ignores the clichÃ©s by keeping the focus off the field and on Beane and his new statistics guru Pete Brand (Jonah Hill). They make a great odd couple, and because the roles have been cast so well, Miller doesn't need to labor the point. Pitt is the ex-golden boy grown restive with a game he feels he can't win. Hill's an overweight computer geek straight out of Yale, the only guy wearing a suit to work. Naturally authoritative and at ease with himself -- except when a game's on (he can't bring himself to watch but can't resist checking in every other minute) -- Beane takes this awkward, earnest kid under his arm and shows him the ropes: how to cut players, how to trade. It's an unsentimental education for Pete and for us, too, as unexpectedly entertaining as the entrepreneurial maneuvers in ""The Social Network."" This is the everyday business of baseball, a side we might read about but rarely see for ourselves. The movie falls into a more familiar groove when the As season turns, and there isn't much Miller or anyone else can do to make short flashbacks to Billy's playing days anything other than functional. But the writing is always sharp and smart, it's lovingly photographed and delicately scored (by Wally Pfister and Mychael Danna, respectively). Yet it's Pitt's movie. Whether he's brooding in the dark as the As lose again, having it out with the team's recalcitrant coach (Philip Seymour Hoffman in a thankless role) and angry head scout (Vyto Ruginis), or trying to reassure his precocious 12-year-old (Kerris Dorsey) that his head isn't really on the block, Pitt has a watchful, introspective quality that makes ""Moneyball"" more than the sum of its statistical components. It's a fascinating portrait of a man who's given his life to baseball and is trying to figure out if it's worth it. The movie itself is not a game changer by any means, but it's more than good enough to make you think again about what success adds up to in the long run.","""Moneyball"" is a fascinating portrait of a man who gives his life to baseball .

"(CNN) -- Rina was almost a Category 3 hurricane as it careened near Honduras and Belize Wednesday before heading towards Cancun. The storm was packing 110 mph winds early Wednesday morning and moving at 3 mph, according to the Miami-based National Hurricane Center. That is 1 mph away from a Category 3 hurricane. Forecast models show Rina strengthening into a Category 3 hurricane before approaching the Yucatan. The projected path shows Rina back at Category 2 intensity when it takes aim at Cancun on Thursday. Residents and worried travelers in Cancun stocked up on supplies Tuesday to prepare for the storm to hit the popular Mexican resort city. Carla Bautista bought bread, water and canned tuna. ""It's my first hurricane. This is new. ... I'm a little afraid, because I don't know what to expect,"" said Bautista, 28, who moved to Cancun two months ago from Mexico City. Mexican officials issued a hurricane warning for the east coast of the Yucatan Peninsula from north of Punta Gruesa to Cancun as the Category 2 storm strengthened. Similarly, U.S. officials issued a travel alert, advising U.S. citizens in the area to prepare themselves for the possibility of a hurricane. Some tourists decided not to take any chances. ""We wanted to get out of there. ... We were on vacation and just didn't want to be stressed,"" said Kathy Davis, 57, an American with a timeshare in Cancun. She said she and her husband celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary at the airport while waiting to catch a flight. In Cancun's hotel area, crews were securing boats and clearing palm fronds and debris. Kelly McLaughlin moved her 6-year-old son's toys inside and trimmed tree branches around her home. ""I'm just checking everything to make sure there's nothing loose,"" said McLaughlin, a Canadian who's lived in Cancun for eight years. McLaughlin, 40, said preparing for storms has become routine since Hurricane Wilma devastated the area in 2005. ""My friends that are fairly new to Cancun are a lot more nervous and starting to get a little stressed,"" she said. ""I'm just trying to keep everyone calm."" Lines at supermarkets and gas stations were long, residents said. As of 2 a.m. ET Wednesday, the center of Rina was about 240 miles east-southeast of Chetumal, Mexico, and 250 miles southeast of Cozumel, Mexico. It was moving west at 3 mph, but was expected to gradually turn northwest and speed up over the next two days, forecasters said. CNN's Catherine E. Shoiche and journalist Brisa Munoz of CNNMexico.com contributed to this report.","Rina is just shy of being a Category 3 hurricane .

"(CNN) -- Spanish underdogs Levante kept up their remarkable early-season form by beating Real Sociedad 3-2, their seventh successive victory, to stay top of La Liga. Levante, a team that has played second fiddle to city rivals Valencia during their 102 year history and who have never finished higher than 10th, has remarkably fended off the attentions of Spanish giants Real Madrid and Barcelona with a quarter of the season gone. But it took an injury time free kick by Ruben Suarez to make sure of all three points after Real Sociedad's Inigo MartÃ­nez had scored a late equalizer. Sociedad had taken an early lead through Daniel Estrada before Nano Rivas and Valdo Lopes put Levante in front. But despite a late equalizer, Levante came back with Suarez's stunning free kick, which saw them leapfrog Barcelona into top spot. Real Madrid did their best to keep up with Levante after blowing Villarreal away in the first half an hour at the Santiago Bernabeu. Villarreal, perennial UEFA Champions League qualifiers in recent years, have endured a torrid start to the season, made worse when Karim Benzema scored an early goal. Kaka was then set up by Argentine international Angel Di Maria, who capped a fine half by scoring the third. The match petered out in the second half, finishing 3-0 and sending Real Madrid second above Barcelona. In Italy's Serie A Udinese missed the chance of returning to the top of the league after losing away to Napoli 2-0. Two first half strikes from Ezequiel Lavezzi and Christian Maggio ended Udinese's unbeaten start to the season. But the result of the night saw AC Milan score four goals in successive games after beating Parma 4-1. Milan found themselves 3-0 down against Lecce last week before mounting a thrilling comeback. A second half Kevin Prince Boetang hat-trick secured an unlikely 4-3 victory and it was another three-goal haul that guaranteed all the points against Parma. This time Antonio Nocerino was the hero. His first half double put Milan in control before Zlatan Ibrahimovic put the victory beyond Parma, who scored a late consolation before Nocerino completed his hat-trick in the 90th minute. ""Right now the important thing is to return to the top and we can do that,"" coach Massimiliano Allegri told AFP. ""This is an important result to give us consistency. The table is starting to get stretched and we must stay amongst the leaders.""","Levante beat Real Sociedad 3-2 to stay top of Spain's La Liga .

"(CNN) -- Kimi Raikkonen will return to Formula One in 2012, after Renault announced on Tuesday that the 2007 world champion has signed a two-year deal with the team. The Finn won the drivers' championship with Ferrari in 2007 before leaving the sport in 2009, but he will return next season after spending time in the World Rally Championship and NASCAR. ""I'm delighted to be coming back to Formula 1 after a two-year break, and I'm grateful to Lotus Renault GP for offering me this opportunity,"" the 32-year-old told the team's official website. ""My time in the World Rally Championship has been a useful stage in my career as a driver, but I can't deny the fact that my hunger for F1 has recently become overwhelming. Final F1 2011 season standings . ""It was an easy choice to return with Lotus Renault GP as I have been impressed by the scope of the team's ambition.

Raikkonen entered F1 with Sauber in 2001 before going on to enjoy a successful five-season spell with McLaren between 2002 and 2006, winning nine grands prix and twice finishing runner-up in the world championship. Speaking to CNN World Sport, Renault team principal Eric Boullier said he was delighted to have secured Raikkonen's services and insisted the Finn would soon be challenging the sport's top echelon of drivers. ""His motivation is huge and clearly the talent he has will maybe need a little bit of time to get back on track and to adapt to the new car and the new tires but I'm very confident he will get back,"" he said. ""I hope we push as much as we can, as much as we did at the beginning of the season. It is difficult to set up a competitive Formula One team, it takes time, but we learn every year from the experience. ""Kimi's experience is huge, he has been world champion, he has won many races, he has been working and driving for great constructors like Sauber and McLaren. It will be a huge boost for us and his determination will be a big boost for the team."" Ferrari's Alonso eyes 2012 charge . Boullier said Renault, who will compete under the Lotus name in 2012, were still yet to decide who would partner Raikkonen after they were represented by three drivers last season. Russian Vitaly Petrov initially partnered Nick Heidfeld before Brazilian Bruno Senna replaced the German in August. Polish driver Robert Kubica raced for the team in 2010, but missed all of last season following a rally crash in Italy in February. It had been hoped Kubica would return in time for the 2012 season, but the 26-year-old announced last week that his recovery from serious arm injuries was not yet complete. Boullier said he did not yet know if Kubica would be fit to race: ""It's a little bit early to answer this question,"" he added. ""If we can bring him back into F1 we will try our best."" The 2011 season came to an end at last Sunday's Brazilian Grand Prix, with Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel finishing the race second behind teammate Mark Webber having already sealed a second consecutive championship. The 2012 season will is see a total of six former world champions line-up on the grid, with Raikonnen and Vettel being joined by Mercedes' seven-time winner Michael Schumacher, Ferrari's two-time champion Fernando Alonso and McLaren's championship-winning duo of Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton.","2007 world champion Kimi Raikkonen will return to F1 in 2012 .

A previously discovered patent indicates that Apple could be working on an integrated projector for iDevices that would incorporate physical gestures as a method to manipulate a projected image. This newer patent, however, focuses more on the gestures themselves and other ways they could be used to control onscreen images and video. There's no mention of Siri or combining voice control with physical gestures. The 3-D gesture-capturing method would employ a device's front-facing camera. The iPad 2, iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S all include a front-facing camera, so if Apple, say, decided to integrate this feature in an upcoming version of iOS, it's possible that legacy iDevice models could employ the technology as well. That said, the patent does suggest that older iPhones may not have enough processing power for the gesture-capturing workload, as it shows a way to transfer video from the iPhone to an iPad for more advanced editing options. The patent pre-defines a number of gestures, such as ones for facial recognition, a selection gesture and a pointing gesture (to identify a specific section of an onscreen image). The patent was originally filed in mid-2010. Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT! Click here!

"(CNN) -- It was the first house she looked at upon arriving in the small town in central Italy that would be her home for a semester abroad. But Amanda Knox immediately knew it was the one for her. The University of Washington student had been in Perugia for just a few hours on a hot summer day in 2007 with her younger sister, Deanna, who saw a poster that included the word ""appartamento."" They followed the girl who had posted the ad to a charming, four-bedroom villa near the University for Foreigners of Perugia overlooking a small valley where figs grew. The sisters chatted for hours in the kitchen with the two friendly Italian girls who lived there and made plans with them to tour the town the next day. To the wanderlust-driven young American, who had been hitting the books hard and working multiple jobs since high school so she could study abroad, it was a dream come true. ""She didn't need to see any other place, she didn't need to see any other listings, she was set,"" says her sister. British exchange student Meredith Kercher moved into the house shortly after Knox settled in. The two foreigners became fast friends, Knox's friends and family say, as they explored Perugia together. None of them had any way of knowing that just weeks later, the home would be the scene of a grisly stabbing that would leave Kercher dead and Knox branded her cold-blooded killer. Prosecutors in Perugia said Knox directed then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito and another man infatuated with her, Rudy Guede, to hold Kercher down as Knox played with a knife before slashing Kercher's throat. Knox and Sollecito were convicted in 2009. Knox was sentenced to 26 years in prison and Sollecito is serving a 25-year sentence. Guede, a drifter originally from the Ivory Coast, was tried separately and is serving a 16-year sentence. Knox and Sollecito are awaiting a ruling on their appeal against conviction. Media paints two portraits of Knox . The sordid saga has played out in worldwide media long enough to have broken into dual narratives. Some journalists have portrayed Knox as an overly trusting college student who some believe was railroaded by the Italian justice system. Other media paint her as a licentious, manipulative young American still trying to get away with murder, despite an alleged confession, which she quickly recanted, and a conviction. To Knox's friends and family, it's a no-brainer. They grimace at the description prosecutors painted of Knox as a resentful American so angry with Kercher that she exacted revenge during a twisted sexual misadventure. Nothing in her past indicated she had the desire or capacity to kill anyone, let alone a friend, they say. One friend told CNN she was the kind of person who would pick up a spider and take it outside rather than kill it. More than anything, they say, her life had been all about immersing herself in new experiences and creating opportunities to travel abroad. Easy daughter . Growing up in Seattle, Washington, Knox was an easy daughter from the start, says Edda Mellas, Knox's mother. She was a child who never had to be told to do her homework or go to bed on time. She maintained a balance between a life indoors, where she studied regularly and read for pleasure, and a passion for outdoor activities and sports, in particular gymnastics and soccer. Knox's desire to study foreign languages and experience different cultures also became apparent early on, Mellas says. She took Latin in middle school and began expressing a desire to travel abroad. Even though her parents told her they couldn't afford a private high school, she applied on her own and was accepted with a substantial scholarship. She learned Japanese in high school and spent time in Japan as part of her studies, her mother says. ""She loved learning languages. She thought about being an interpreter. She really wanted to be a writer and I said, 'Maybe you need to get a day job while you're trying to make money being a writer.' And then she thought about being an interpreter. Languages were definitely her kind of gift."" In 2004, her mother took her daughters to Europe. They visited family in Austria and spent Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany. ""They just loved seeing the history and the culture and differences in people. And it was a great experience,"" Mellas said. Knox eventually turned her sights to studying abroad in college. She rejected soccer scholarships from several schools because she knew she would have to commit to the sports program. So again, she set her sights on a longshot: the highly competitive University of Washington. She got in and made a positive first impression on practically everyone she met, says friend Andrew Seliber, who testified at her trial as a character witness. ""I think it was her just open personality to, you know, see the good things in people and have always a positive attitude about everybody and everything in the world.  And it was really refreshing coming to school and meeting people like that, especially like her, who were, you know, so willing to see everybody's perspectives about, you know, anything."" Seliber adds she worked hard to keep up her GPA, making the dean's list almost every quarter, so she could travel her junior year. ""I think (studying abroad) was kind of an extension of that personality where she always wanted to meet people and -- and just get their perspectives on the world, because there's really no better way of opening yourself up than to travel the world,"" Seliber says. She considered Germany, Austria and Scotland, her mother says, before deciding on Italy, a place she'd never been and where the people spoke a language she hadn't studied. ""She wanted to try something different,"" Mellas says. ""Once she decided on Italy, she thought about going to the really typical places: Florence or Rome. But she really thought that to her seemed more touristy. And she wanted just everyday, small-town, regular Italians and not where there would be hundreds of English-speaking people. She wanted to immerse herself in a smaller town and -- she looked around and Perugia had a program."" Mellas worried about her but took comfort in the fact that she would be close to relatives in Europe. ""You worry if you send your kids that far away. But it was also a dream of hers that you know, nobody was going to squash. I worried that she was too trusting. I worried that she didn't have enough self-preservation kind of instincts."" European adventure . Knox worked in two coffee shops and an art gallery, living frugally to save the $10,000 she would need for the trip. Finally, the time arrived for her to begin her adventure in August 2007. She and her sister went to Europe to visit relatives before catching a train to Perugia. From the start, it was an adventure, her sister says. ""We showed up in Perugia on the train and just thought we could find our way to her hotel, and realized that we had no idea where we were going. So we ended up hiking with our backpacks like, five miles right off the train station to even find a bus that would take us to our hotel,"" Deanna Knox says. As soon as they arrived, Knox made her way to the University for Foreigners of Perugia to get the lay of the land. ""The city was really beautiful. You could really tell on Amanda's face and how she was acting that she was instantly in love."" After school began, Knox sent enthusiastic e-mails to her family nearly every day. She described attending a chocolate festival and a book fair with Kercher. A few weeks into her stay, she wrote in various e-mails that she had met a handsome computer engineering student who looked like Harry Potter at a classical music concert. Knox had been a ""late bloomer"" in terms of dating, so news that she had met Raffaele Sollecito made her sister happy. ""She was just infatuated with the whole idea of him. First of all, he was a foreign guy, he was sweet, he was really kind, he was smart. ... He was exactly my sister's type."" Deanna Knox says. ""It was pretty exciting. I wanted to learn more about him, and it just happened that they were only dating for two weeks before everything happened. I wish -- I really wish that they could've gotten to know each other a lot better."" CNN's Mallory Simon and Todd Schwarzschild contributed to this report.","Friends, family: Nothing about Amanda Knox's past suggests she's a killer .

"(CNN) -- An Arizona man lay handcuffed and non-responsive on the floor of a Walmart on Black Friday, as his emotional grandson stood nearby. Jerald Newman, 54, spent Friday night in a Maricopa County jail hours after being arrested for allegedly resisting arrest and shoplifting, according to the county sheriff's department. But the suspect's family members, as well as at least one witness, said the man is innocent and that the treatment was unnecessary. Newman's daughter said that she, her father and other family members were in the packed Buckeye, Arizona, store soon after it opened late Thursday night. ""They were just letting people in; there was nowhere to walk,"" Berneta Sanchez told CNN. ""And teenagers and adults were fighting for these games, taking them away from little kids and away from my father."" The grandson, Nicholas Nava, told CNN affiliate KNXV that Newman had grabbed one video game and put it under his shirt so that others jostling for the game didn't take it from him. One person alerted a police officer, who then approached Newman. David Chadd, a CNN iReporter from Las Vegas, was among those shopping for video games set up in the Walmart's grocery section in a mass of people. He said Newman ""was not resisting"" arrest as he was led away from the crowd by a police officer. The officer, Chadd said, then suddenly hooked the suspect around the leg, grabbed him and ""slammed him face first into the ground."" ""It was like a bowling ball hitting the ground, that's how bad it was,"" he said. That was around when Sanchez said she heard of the altercation from across the store and ran toward her father. ""I was fuming,"" she recalled upon seeing her father on the floor. ""They wouldn't let me near him at all, they were telling me to stay back."" Video, recorded by Chadd and later posted on CNN's iReport, shows an apparently unconscious Newman head-down on the floor in a pool of blood. As he's turned over, Buckeye police officers appear to attempt to revive him -- at which point his face, covered mostly in blood, is revealed. Several voices, apparently those of fellow shoppers, are heard saying, ""Why would you throw him down so hard? All he did was shoplifting and you threw him down like that?"" Another person says, ""They threw him down. He wasn't doing anything wrong."" Two citizens then appear to come to Newman's aid by applying paper towels to the man's nose. Chadd estimated that Newman was knocked out for about 10 minutes, all the while gushing blood and handcuffed. Walmart spokeswoman Ashley Hardie said the retail giant was aware of the incident. ""We are concerned whenever there is an incident involving a customer at one of our stores,"" Hardie said. ""We are in contact with the local police and are sharing any information we have with them."" Members of the Buckeye Police Department did not immediately respond to CNN calls Friday for comment. Assistant Chief Larry Hall told KNXV that Newman struggled after getting hurt, saying he was aggressive and escalated the situation. ""There's a whole other side to this story that wasn't videotaped,"" Hall said. ""There is nothing, on the surface, (that) deems our officer acted inappropriate at this time."" The Buckeye incident was one of a few such incidents involving police and shoppers at the chain's stores nationwide. Sanchez said that Newman was ""emotional"" when she talked to him, briefly, on Friday from a hospital where he was treated before being sent to jail. ""He was complaining of his pain, and he was angry,"" she said. She described her father as ""a really nice man,"" noting he is a custom furniture-maker who preaches through the California prison system. He has raised his grandson from birth and, even while in the hospital, Sanchez said the boy was her father's chief concern. Family members are hoping for a call from law enforcement, informing them that they can pick up Newman, Sanchez said. Until then, she said her mother plans to talk to a lawyer Saturday to work on expediting the man's release. Whatever happens, Sanchez vowed that next year she won't be shopping in the wee hours of the Friday morning after Thanksgiving. ""I will never leave my house again on Black Friday, because I don't want to put my daughter through that again,"" she said, noting her daughter was there to see police standing over her bloody grandfather. ""I'd rather stay home. And if they have Black Friday, they need more security.""

"(CNN) -- Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova will open proceedings at the WTA Championships in Istanbul Tuesday in her first appearance in the prestigious end-of-season finale. The Czech was a surprise winner at SW19, beating Maria Sharapova in the final of the grass court grand slam, helping her to earn a place in the elite eight-strong field in Turkey. She faces experienced Russian Vera Zvonerava in the first match in Red Group and knows that to progress from the robin stage will be tough. ""It doesn't matter who's in the group. All eight players are very strong,"" she told the WTA official website. Kvitova, with four other titles in her breakthrough season, must emerge in the top two out of section which also includes World No.1 Caroline Wozniacki and Agnieszka Radwanska. Pole Radwanska is also a newcomer to the WTA Championships after a storming late season run with two titles. Arguably, she is in better form than her opponent Wozniacki in the second match on court Tuesday. While she was winning titles in Beijing and Tokyo, Danish ace Wozniacki was making early exits. ""I was the last one to get in here so I'm just going to enjoy myself and try to play my best tennis, like in Asia,"" said Radwanska, who had to sweat on the performance of first alternate Marion Bartoli in the final counting event at the Kremlin Cup before sealing her place. The final match of the first day's proceedings pits Sharapova against newly-crowned U.S. Open champion Samantha Stosur in the Blue Group. Victoria Azarenka of Belarus and China's Li Na complete the section and will be in action Wednesday. Stosur, who stunned Serena Williams to claim her first grand slam title at Flushing Meadows, knows she faces a tough task to progress. ""Maria (Sharapova) and Victoria (Azarenka) I've never beaten before, so there's a great challenge in itself,"" she said. Defending champion Kim Clijsters, who beat Wozniacki in last year's final, did not qualify for the tournament after a season ruined by injury, while Williams has not played since reaching the final at the U.S. Open and is in 12th place in the rankings. Sharapova, who beat Williams for the title in 2004, is the only previous winner of the event in an inexperienced field with French Open champion Li Na joining Kvitova and Radwanska as first timers.","WTA Championships begin in Istanbul Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- New striker Gervinho was sent off on his Premier League debut as Arsenal drew 0-0 against Newcastle United at St James Park in their opening match of the season on Saturday. It was unedifying end to a difficult week for Gunners' fans who appear to be on the brink of losing star midfielder Cesc Fabregas to Barcelona and Samir Nasri to the blue side of Manchester. Fabregas expected to join Barcelona . Arsenal dominated possession with little to show for their efforts as Newcastle defended stoutly. And the home side's cause was helped no end by the Ivorian striker who was given his marching orders in the 76th minute after he slapped Newcastle's Joey Barton during an altercation in the penalty area. Liverpool's new summer signings couldn't fashion a win at Anfield as they drew 1-1 with Sunderland. Luis Suarez opened the scoring with a header in the 12th minute, making amends for a penalty he missed in the third minute after Sunderland midfielder Kieron Richardson had brought down the Uruguayan striker. New midfielder's Stewart Downing, Charlie Adam and Jordan Henderson all started for Liverpool, as did new defender Jose Enrique, but after a bright first half the Reds faded. Sunderland's stubborn collective defensive effort in the second half was rewarded with a moment of individual brilliance when Swedish international Sebastian Larsson equalized with a spectacular volley in the 57th minute. ""Sunderland made it difficult for us, they worked really hard and I think they deserved a point,"" Liverpool's manager, Kenny Dalglish said afterwards, AFP reported. Bolton Wanderers were one of only two teams to manage a win on the opening day of the new season, thumping newly-promoted Queens Park Rangers 4-0 at Loftus Road. Gary Cahill opened the scoring in first-half injury time with a curling effort from 25 yards. QPR defender Danny Gabbidon then handed Bolton a 2-0 lead when he deflected a Chris Eagles' free-kick into his own net. Croatian striker Ivan Klasnic added a third with 20 minutes remaining before Fabrice Muamba completed the rout of the west Londoners. Wolverhampton Wanderers were the other winners on Saturday as they came from behind to beat Blackburn Rovers 2-1 at Ewood Park. Blackburn debutant Mauro Formica gave the home side the lead after 20 minutes only to see Steven Fletcher level the scores two minutes later. Wolves were ahead shortly after the break when Stephen Ward volleyed home from close range after Irish striker Kevin Doyle had his penalty saved by Blackburn's 'keeper Paul Robinson. New boys Norwich City fared better in their first Premier League outing claiming a creditable 1-1 draw at Wigan. Ben Watson slotted home a penalty in the 21st minute (after Ritchie de Laet felled Franco di Santo) to give the home side the lead. But Norwich fought their way back into the match and were rewarded when Wes Hoolahan pounced on a mistake Wigan keeper Ali Al Habsi to equalize moments before halftime. Fulham and Aston Villa played out a goalless draw at Craven Cottage. Champions Manchester United kick off their campaign on Sunday when they travel to West Bromwich Albion, while Chelsea are away to Stoke City.

"(CNN) -- Ground-to-air missiles at the 2012 Olympic Games? It's not a new sport added to the London line-up, but proof that Britain's government is taking security seriously. Defense secretary Phillip Hammond has confirmed that such weapons will be at the disposal of those tasked with ensuring public safety at the UK capital's summer showpiece. He told parliament that a full range of options would be available for protecting the Games, which kick off on July 27. Hammond was asked by his predecessor, Liam Fox, to confirm if a ""full range of multilayered defense and deterrents"" would be on hand, including surface-to-air missiles. ""I can assure him that all necessary measures to ensure the security and safety of the London Olympic Games will be taken including -- if the advice of the military is that it is required -- appropriate ground-to-air defenses,"" Hammond replied. Earlier on Monday, British newspaper The Guardian had claimed the United States was planning to send 1,000 security personnel, including FBI agents, to the Olympics after developing concerns about arrangements. The paper said that the UK government is having to field more and more questions on security from its U.S. counterpart, with one source saying of the White House: ""They are being very demanding."" It also claimed the London Organizing Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games has decided to more than double the amount of security guards protecting the 32 Olympic sites across the country to 21,000 from 10,000. The Guardian quoted the UK Home Office, responsible for home security, as saying its Olympic planning was ""on track"" and that the funding was in place. ""The government is committed to delivering a safe and secure Games that London, the UK and the world can enjoy,"" a spokesman said.","MP tells British parliament ground-to-air missiles available to protect London 2012 .

"(CNN) -- Eleven people were killed Tuesday during clashes with Yemeni security forces after anti-government protests again filled the streets of the country's capital, according to a hospital official. Crowds marched through downtown Sanaa, where government forces allegedly gunned down protesters -- the latest in a series of confrontations between those loyal to embattled President Ali Abdullah Saleh, demonstrators and rival factions. Hundreds of security forces attempted to restrict the protesters' movements, and tear-gas canisters could be seen flying toward the crowd, said hospital director Mohammed Qubati. Others carrying sticks and knives also advanced toward the crowds, Qubati added. CNN has not independently confirmed the details of casualties, and the government has not yet responded to requests for comment. The violence comes one day after thousands of women demonstrated in front of Yemen's Foreign Ministry in Sanaa, demanding U.N. intervention in the ongoing unrest in the Persian Gulf nation. The women called for sanctions against Saleh and asked that the International Criminal Court try him. Saleh said Sunday that ""strong documentation of the cooperation"" between al Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood indicate a military coup that is destabilizing the country. He described the opposition as ""insane people, who can't sleep and only want to take power.""","Eleven people reportedly die in clashes Tuesday in Yemen .

"(CNN) -- Stocks on key Asian exchanges dropped modestly early Monday on what is likely to be an eventful day in world markets, following Standard and Poor's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. In early Tokyo trading, the Nikkei index fell 124 points, or 1.3%. South Korea's KOSPI index slipped 1.6%. In Australia, the All Ordinaries index lost 0.7%. The Shanghai composite started 0.8% lower. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index tumbled 2.6% at the open. Similarly, U.S. stock futures fell around 1.7% in early electronic trading Sunday. The futures were the first U.S. gauge of investor sentiment following Friday night's downgrade, removing the United States' AAA status for the first time. They give an indication of how investors will react when regular-hours U.S. trading begins at 9:30 a.m. ET Monday. Besides the U.S. downgrade, investors are concerned about the debt crisis in some European nations, though actions on the part of the G7 and the European Central Bank Sunday helped to allay some of those fears. Financial representatives of leading industrial nations said they are committed to taking ""all necessary measures to support financial stability and growth in a spirit of close cooperation and confidence."" They welcomed the ""decisive actions taken in the U.S. and Europe"" and ""the additional policy measures announced by Italy and Spain to strengthen fiscal discipline and underpin the recovery in economic activity and job creation."" ""We are committed to taking coordinated action where needed, to ensuring liquidity, and to supporting financial market functioning, financial stability and economic growth,"" G7 finance ministers and central bank governors said in a Sunday night statement. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner had been expected to take part in a conference call with representatives of the other G7 nations to discuss the downgraded U.S. credit rating, a G7 official told CNN. The G7 nations are the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Canada and the United States. Similarly, the European Central Bank made a bid to calm markets Sunday. It said it would implement a bond-purchase program and welcomed announcements by Italy and Spain on new measures meant to reduce their deficits. It told the governments of those countries that a ""decisive and swift implementation"" of reforms is ""essential."" The move represents an escalation in the official response to Europe's debt crisis, which is now more than a year old and until recently was contained to smaller economies like Greece, Ireland and Portugal. International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde cheered the announcements. ""I welcome the statements from the European Central Bank, from the leaders of Germany and France as well as from the G7, and their renewed commitment to take all necessary action in a coordinated way to ensure stability and liquidity in the financial markets. This cooperation will contribute to maintaining confidence and spurring global economic growth,"" she said in a statement. Middle Eastern markets, the first to open since the downgrade, were sharply lower on Sunday. Israel's market temporarily halted trading at one point and finished down more than 6%, while the Dubai Financial Market General Index fell 3.7%. The General Index on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange was down more than 2.5%, while in Saudi Arabia, the Tadawul All-Share Index dropped nearly 5.5% in trading Saturday. U.S. officials are talking to a ""wide range of investors"" about the downgrade by the credit agency to try to ""mitigate"" any short-term negative impact from Friday's announcement, a Treasury official told CNN. Top Standard & Poor's officials said Sunday that the downgraded credit rating for the United States was both a call for political consensus on significant deficit reduction and a warning of possible further credit problems down the road. ""We have a negative outlook on the rating and that means that we think the risks currently on the rating are to the downside,"" said David Beers, the S&P global head of sovereign ratings, on ""Fox News Sunday."" However, Beers said markets were reacting to the debt crises in some European countries and fears of a global economic slump, rather than the U.S. credit downgrade alone. John Chambers, the S&P head of sovereign ratings, told ABC's ""This Week"" program Saturday that it could take years for the United States to return to AAA status. ""Well, if history is a guide, it could take a while,"" Chambers said. ""We've had five governments that lost their AAA that got it back. The amount of time that it took for those five range from nine years to 18 years, so it takes a while."" The agency's concerns ""are centered on the political side and on the fiscal side,"" Chambers said. ""So it would take a stabilization of the debt as a share of the economy and eventual decline,"" he said. ""And it would take, I think, more ability to reach consensus in Washington than what we're observing now."" Both Beers and Bill Miller, chairman and chief investment officer at Legg Mason Capital Management, told the Fox program that they don't expect the U.S. downgrade to cause a spike in interest rates, one of the possible results of the higher risk now attached to U.S. debt. ""I don't think we'll pay more in interest,"" Miller said, calling the downgrade more of a symbolic event than an economic event. However, he warned of continuing market volatility in coming days driven by uncertainty. Rating agencies such as S&P, Moody's and Fitch analyze risk and give debt a grade that is supposed to reflect the borrower's ability to repay its loans. The safest bets are stamped AAA. That's where the U.S. debt has stood for years. Moody's first assigned the United States an AAA rating in 1917. Fitch and Moody's, the other two main credit ratings agencies, maintained the AAA rating for the United States after last week's debt deal, though Moody's lowered its outlook on U.S. debt to ""negative."" A negative outlook indicates the possibility that Moody's could downgrade the country's sovereign credit rating within a year or two. U.S. Treasury officials received S&P's analysis Friday afternoon and alerted the agency to an error that inflated U.S. deficits by $2 trillion, said an administration official, who was not authorized to speak for attribution. The agency acknowledged the mistake, but said it was sticking with its decision. The administration official called it ""a facts-be-damned decision ... Their analysis was way off, but they wouldn't budge."" Saturday, Gene Sperling, director of Obama's National Economic Council, criticized S&P's call. ""The magnitude of their error and the amateurism it displayed, combined with their willingness to simply change on the spot their lead rationale in their press release once the error was pointed out, was breathtaking. It smacked of an institution starting with a conclusion and shaping any arguments to fit it,"" he said. But Beers defended his agency's move on Sunday, telling the Fox program: ""The underlying debt burden of the U.S. government is rising and will continue to rise over the next decade."" CNN's Tom Cohen, Kyung Lah and Mark Meinero contributed to this report.","Losses are modest in Tokyo, Seoul, Sydney and Shanghai .

"(CNN) -- When the 13th cannon raised from Blackbeard's flagship, Queen Anne's Revenge, came to the surface this morning, researchers at the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources had one question: Was it loaded? The 8-foot cannon is one of 25 found since the vessel's discovery in 1997, a treasure trove of 280,000 artifacts pulled to surface over 14 years. Shackles, ship riggings, crystal wine glasses' remains, and cannon shot are among the booty. Four cannons have so far been found ""with cannon shot and wads in place ready to be fired,"" said Sarah Watkins-Kenney, Queen Ann's Revenge chief conservator. Christened ""Baby Ruth,"" the newest cannon can only reveal its secrets after researchers painstakingly remove the ""concretion"" from the 1-ton weapon. Concretion is a cement-like shell of sand, salt and sea life that can take archaeologists up to five years to remove. The Queen Anne's Revenge's remains are scuttled two miles off the North Carolina coast near Atlantic Beach in 25 feet of water, where the pirate Blackbeard left the vessel in June 1718. Historians believe Blackbeard and his fleet of 300 to 400 pirates wanted to rid themselves of the vessel. ""It's believed he ran this aground intentionally as a part of corporate downsizing,"" said Fay Mitchell with North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources. Researchers continue to work the site. ""Our goal is to have research on the site completed by 2013, assuming the funding holds out,"" Mitchell said.","The 8-foot cannon is one of 25 found since the vessel's discovery in 1997 .

"(CNN) -- These are hard times in the United States. The government released its annual report on income, poverty and insurance coverage last week. The median income in the U.S. in 2010 was $49,445, which is 2.3% lower than it was in 2009. But that's just the median. To understand how bad things really are, we need to look at poverty. Let's be explicit. To qualify as below the poverty line, you have to be really poor. A single person under the age of 65 has to earn less than $11,244 to be considered in poverty. That's significantly less than a full-time minimum wage job. A single mother with a child has to make less than $15,030 to be considered in poverty. The percentage of people who met these criteria increased to 15.1% in 2010 from 14.3% in 2009. It's gone up steadily since 2007 when it was 12.5%. What really hurts, however, is exactly who in America qualifies as living in poverty. Because of the social safety nets in place, relatively few people over 64 are very poor (9%). Children, on the other hand, suffer greatly. About 22% of Americans under 18 live in poverty. Let me say that again: More than one in five children in the United States is living in poverty. Children account for more than one-third of all such people in the U.S. right now. Think about that when we talk about how to save money in the future. I'm a health services researcher, and incredibly invested in how we reform the health care system of this country. It's why I'd also like you to focus on the plight of the uninsured. In 2010, the report said, the number of people in the United States who lacked insurance for an entire year was 49.9 million. This is the largest number of people without insurance since the passage of Medicare and Medicaid. Almost all of these people are below 65. (Pretty much every American over 65 is on Medicare, after all.) It gets worse. The percentage of Americans who were covered by private health insurance decreased again -- to 64%; the number of people covered by employer-provided health insurance dropped to 55.3%. Where did all of these people go? Lots of them went to the government, as the number with Medicaid coverage increased to 15.9% and those with Medicare coverage increased to 14.5%. America is hurting. Unemployment is on the rise. Poverty is increasing. More people are losing or unable to get private insurance, and turning to our safety nets for coverage. Most of the benefits and improvements of the Affordable Care Act -- the large Medicaid expansion, the exchanges, the mandate, the subsidies -- won't go into effect until 2014. (An early feature of the act that has already gone into effect has allowed hundreds of thousands of young people under 26 to remain on their parents' insurance, and this group has fared better.) This is the truth we face as we talk about how to reform the health care system: Some claim we need to depend on the private market more and more, but it's shrinking and unable to cover those who need it. Some want to cut Medicaid funding, but it's responsible for covering more and more Americans. It's important to face reality. Of the 75 million or so children in the United States right now, more than one third are covered by Medicaid; an additional 10% or so are uninsured. When we talk about cutting Medicaid funding, we're talking about making things worse for these children. There's no getting around that. I know that there's a deficit problem, and I know that it's important to get a handle on entitlement spending. But we can't ignore that right now Medicaid is one of the cheapest insurance programs around. People seem to have forgotten, but the reason the Affordable Care Act puts 20 million more people in Medicaid is that it was cheaper than putting them in the exchanges to get private insurance. Moreover, about 5% of Medicaid enrollees account for more than 50% of all Medicaid spending. That spending is almost all on elderly and disabled people. It's unlikely these people will be cut from Medicaid. Poor children? Poor adults? Far more likely. There will be hard decisions ahead. No one can deny that entitlement spending, especially health care spending, is unsustainable on its current path. We must be able to look at the budget and talk about areas where we might spend less. That will inevitably lead to some groups getting less than they did before. Yet, as voting blocs and advocacy groups defend their piece of the pie, let's not forget those who cannot speak for themselves. The ranks of the poor are growing. They're populated with children. And they depend on Medicaid for their health care in increasing numbers. Let's not sacrifice their future while we're trying to save it for the rest of us.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A third day of testimony gets underway in a Los Angeles courtroom Thursday as a judge decides whether Dr. Conrad Murray will face trial for involuntary manslaughter in the death of singer Michael Jackson. On Wednesday, a paramedic and a security guard testified that Jackson appeared to be dead when an ambulance arrived at his home at 12:26 p.m. June 25, 2009. ""When I picked him up, his legs were quite cool,"" Los Angeles County Paramedic Richard Senneff said. ""His eyes were quite dry."" No pulse was detected, and the paramedics' heart monitor showed Jackson was ""flatlined"" as he lay on his bedroom floor, Senneff testified. Prosecutors contend that Murray's should be held criminally responsible for giving the pop star a surgical anesthetic, propofol, at home without monitoring equipment. The coroner concluded Jackson died from ""acute propofol intoxication,"" in combination ""the contributory affects of the benzodiazepines,"" Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney David Walgren said. Murray allegedly delayed calling for help when he found Jackson was not breathing, misled paramedics and doctors about the series of sedatives and the anesthetic he'd given him and that he tried to hide evidence when he should have been trying to revive Jackson. Murray told paramedics he had only given Jackson a dose of lorazepam to help him sleep and that he was treating him for dehydration, Senneff testified. When he asked ""how long the patient was down,"" the doctor responded ""'It just happened,'"" Senneff testified. The paramedic said that account""it didn't add up."" Testimony Wednesday also included emotional accounts of crying and praying in the home as Jackson's children and employees realized something was very wrong upstairs. Jackson chef Kia Chase said the first indication of a crisis was when Murray ran downstairs in a panic and asked her to send Jackson's oldest son, Prince, and the security guard upstairs. ""His eyes were enlarged,"" Chase testified. ""He was screaming."" After the housekeepers started crying, the rest of the staff joined them, she said. ""We started praying,"" Chase said. ""We held hands, and we were crying."" Jackson's two oldest children, Prince and Paris, watched from a bedroom doorway as Murray tried to revive their father before the ambulance arrived, according to Alberto Alvarez, who worked on Jackson's security team. ""Paris screamed 'Daddy!' and she started crying,"" Alvarez testified. Michael Jackson's three sisters, parents and brother Randy listened from the second row of the courtroom as Alvarez appeared to be near tears as he described the scene. ""Dr. Murray then said 'Get them out, get them out. Don't let them see their father like this,' "" Alvarez said. ""I turned to the children and I told them 'Don't worry, children, we'll take care of it. Go outside please.' "" Alvarez testified that Murray asked for his help in collecting medicines from around the bedroom. ""He then grabbed a handful of bottles or vials,"" Alvarez said. ""He instructed me to put them in a bag."" It was only then, about 21 minutes after prosecutors say Murray realized Jackson was not breathing, that he asked Alvarez to call for an ambulance. It arrived four minutes later. Jackson's former security chief testified that Murray seemed not to know how to administer cardiopulmonary resuscitation as he waited for paramedics to arrive at the singer's house. Faheem Muhammed said he and Alvarez saw Murray crouched next to Jackson's bed ""in a panicked state asking, 'Does anyone know CPR?' "" ""I looked at Alberto because we knew Dr. Murray was a heart surgeon, so we were shocked,"" Muhammed said. When defense lawyer Ed Chernoff asked if perhaps Murray was only asking for help because he was tired, Muhammed said, ""The way that he asked it is as if he didn't know CPR."" Alvarez testified that Murray told him and Muhammed that he was inexperienced at mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. ""After the second time, he gave a breath, he said 'You know, this is the first time that I give mouth-to-mouth, but I have to do it, because he's my friend,' "" Alvarez said. Jackson appeared to be dead at that time, with his ""eyes open and his mouth open, just laying there,"" Muhammed said. Walgren, the deputy district attorney, earlier said that Murray used ""ineffectual CPR with one hand while the patient was prone on a soft bed."" Using two hands with the patient prone on a hard surface is the proper method, he said. Muhammed, testifying Tuesday, said he never saw Murray performing CPR on Jackson before paramedics arrived and transported the singer to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. The hearing, which began Tuesday, is expected to last two or three weeks, with 20 to 30 witnesses testifying. Judge Michael Pastor will determine whether there is probable cause to send Murray to trial. Murray remains free on $75,000 bond.

"(CNN) -- As Occupy Wall Street demonstrates its staying power, media increasingly portray it favorably. Because of its success, the movement is being asked to put forth a list of its demands. So far, members have said no. And well they should. The refusal of Occupy Wall Street to tie itself down with an agenda that can be debated piecemeal is one of its great strengths. The decision allows Occupy Wall Street to remain a cri de coeur for all who believe they have lost ground over the last decade. In choosing this strategy, Occupy Wall Street is doing more than defying expectations. It is linking itself with the best of 1960s America. Fifty years ago in his 1961 Inaugural Address, President John F. Kennedy declared that the torch had been passed to a new generation of Americans. A year later, in its Port Huron Statement of 1962, the group Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), took Kennedy's generational declaration a step further, insisting that the time had come for America to make a new commitment to social justice. For SDS, an organization dominated by college and graduate students, participatory democracy was a version of Occupy Wall Street's horizontal democracy, and to look back at SDS's Port Huron Statement is to see why Occupy Wall Street activists should feel confident about the path they have chosen. The Port Huron Statement was often maddeningly vague. But like Occupy Wall Street's chant, ""We are the 99 percent,"" the Port Huron Statement left no doubt about the all-inclusive equality SDS sought. As Kirkpatrick Sale has written in his definitive history ""SDS: The Rise and Development of the Students for a Democratic Society,"" the organization both captured and shaped the spirit of the new student mood. ""America rests in national stalemate"" was the underlying premise of the Port Huron Statement. SDS believed the ""decline of utopia and hope"" was the defining feature of the American political landscape in the early '60s, and its task was to search for ""truly democratic alternatives."" SDS members had, they believed, grown up when America was the wealthiest and strongest country in the world, and they saw themselves struggling with the complacency such power produced. SDS did not underestimate the difficulty of overcoming the problems it faced. At a time when the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was still years away and the fall of the Berlin Wall was impossible to imagine, SDS was concerned not only with the questions of economic equality but the entrenched racism of the South and the nuclear arms race. The organization conceded that much groundwork had to be laid if serious change was possible. ""The first task of any social movement is to convince people that the search for orienting theories and the creation of human values is complex but worthwhile,"" the Port Huron Statement says. The group never said exactly how it would succeed at that task. But it was clear about what it wanted. ""We would replace power rooted in possession, privilege, or circumstance by power and uniqueness rooted in love, reflectiveness, reason, and creativity."" SDS was not bothered by criticism that such a declaration of principles was too idealistic. It faced its critics head on. ""If we appear to seek the unattainable, as it has been said, then let it be known that we do so to avoid the unimaginable,"" the concluding lines of the Port Huron Statement declare. The organization's faith in people, particularly those belonging to its college-age generation, was knowingly idealistic. At the core of the Port Huron Statement was SDS's unapologetic insistence: ""We regard men as infinitely precious and possessed of unfilled capacities for reason, freedom, and love."" By the end of the 1960s, SDS was a spent force, but the values expressed in the Port Huron Statement had a life of their own. They were echoed in the civil rights movement as well as in the social programs of Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society, and they continued into the 1970s with the antiwar movement. It is too early to predict what will follow from Occupy Wall Street, but the example of SDS and its Port Huron Statement provides a basis for believing Occupy Wall Street rests on much more solid ground than its critics realize. As Occupy Wall Street's General Assembly, its daily mass meeting open to everyone, shows, the movement is not about to be intimidated by the charge -- even when voiced by those on the left -- that it is too elusive and too egalitarian for its own good. Occupy Wall Street's September 29 Declaration of Occupation lists a multitude of grievances, ranging from anger about illegal house foreclosures to outsourcing jobs, but the declaration never departs from its core article of faith and source of appeal. They are registered in its opening sentence, ""As we gather together in solidarity to express a feeling of mass injustice, we must not lose sight of what brought us together."" The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Nicolaus Mills.","Nicolaus Mills: Occupy Wall Street makes smart move by refusing to list demands .
Mills: In 1962, Students for a Democratic Society's Port Huron Statement didn't list demands .
Mills says the values outlined in that statement lived on long after SDS ended .

"(CNN) -- In a videotaped interrogation with Peruvian police broadcast Monday, Joran van der Sloot admitted that he hit, strangled and ultimately killed a 21-year-old woman last year in his Lima hotel room. Footage of the confession by the 24-year-old Dutch national was aired by America TV, a CNN affiliate, as well as other Peruvian news organizations. In it, an interrogator twice asks van der Sloot in Spanish whether he killed Stephany Flores. Both times, he answers yes. The admission is part of a lengthier conversation in which van der Sloot explains that he met the young woman in a casino in Miraflores, and then they went to his hotel room. There, the suspect said, he began hitting her after noticing that she had pulled up news about him on his computer. Wearing a hooded sweatshirt and smoking a cigarette, a seemingly calm van der Sloot answers a series of detailed questions about the case on the video. Among other things, he describes hitting the victim in the head with his elbow and putting two hands around her neck. Van der Sloot was arrested in June 2010 in relation to Flores' death but was not formally charged until this month. The three Peruvian drivers who allegedly helped him flee to Chile after the incident are also charged in the case. Prosecutors want five-year prison sentences for them and fines of about $1,800. Before he resigned as van der Sloot's lawyer this year, Maximo Altez told In Session that his client attacked Flores after she found something on his computer that tied him to the disappearance of Alabama teen Natalee Holloway, who vanished while on a graduation trip to the Caribbean island of Aruba in 2005. Van der Sloot was arrested twice but never charged in connection with Holloway's disappearance, which remains unsolved. ""My client ... admits having murdered the victim, but not with ferocity, for profit or pleasure, nor any of the other element(s) that make up this murder, but only by violent emotion that overtook him at the time he was attacked by the victim,"" Altez said in a motion that was given to In Session. In a September 2010 jailhouse interview with a Dutch television station, van der Sloot refused to answer questions about the Flores case, saying it is ""not in my best interest to talk about it at all."" But he maintained that police tricked him into making a confession, saying they would not let him call his mother, talk to anyone or arrange for an attorney. Van der Sloot's present attorney, Luis Jiminez Navarro, said this month that this client was willing to confess to a ""simple homicide"" charge in relation to Flores' death but not to more serious charges that would carry longer prison terms. Both the accused and the victim's family disagree with the indictment proposed by prosecutor Miriam Riveros Castellares. She asked a three-judge panel to indict van der Sloot on charges of qualified murder and simple robbery, which carry 28-year and two-year sentences. He would also have to make a restitution payment of $73,000 to the victim's family, if convicted. The judges received a proposed counter-indictment in writing from Navarro on September 12, proposing van der Sloot would confess to the simple homicide charge that carried a 20-year maximum prison sentence. But the attorney for the family of the victim told the three judges that the prosecutor's proposed indictment against van der Sloot had ""mistakes,"" a news release from the court said. According to Navarro, the Flores family's lawyer Edward Alvarez Yrala asked the court to charge van der Sloot with a charge similar to aggravated murder, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.","A video is aired Monday by America TV and other Peruvian news organizations .

"(CNN) -- China is continuing to speak out against a multibillion-dollar U.S. arms sale to Taiwan, with the Chinese foreign minister telling U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Monday that the Obama administration should reconsider the deal. Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi met with Clinton in New York, where the United Nations General Assembly is in session, according to a senior State Department official who spoke on background. Yang ""was making very serious representations to Secretary Clinton, asked the Obama administration to reconsider this decision and indicated that it would harm the trust and confidence that was established between the two sides,"" the official said. Chinese officials ""have indicated that they're going to suspend or to cancel or postpone a series of ... military-to-military engagements,"" the official said. Clinton ""responded very clearly"" that the United States has a strategic interest in stability in the region, and that the Taiwan Relations Act ""provides for a strong rationale for the provision of defensive capabilities and weapons to Taiwan as part of a larger context to preserve that peace and stability,"" the official said. Clinton also told Yang that the United States supports improved relations between mainland China and Taiwan. The $5.3 billion arms package includes upgrades to Taiwan's F-16 fighter fleet, a five-year extension of F-16 pilot training at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona and spare parts for the upkeep of three different planes currently in use by the Taiwanese, according to the State Department. The deal is part of the U.S. Foreign Military Sales program. China voiced strong opposition to the deal when it was announced last week, with the state-run Xinhua news agency quoting China's vice foreign minister, Zhang Zhijun, as saying, ""The wrongdoing by the U.S. side will inevitably undermine bilateral relations as well as exchanges and cooperation in military and security areas."" China regards Taiwan as a renegade province. Taiwan began as the remnant of the government that ruled over mainland China, until a Communist uprising proved victorious in 1949. The Taiwan Strait separates the mainland from the island. In 1979, the United States carried out its ""one China"" policy by switching diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing. But the Taiwan Relations Act obligates the United States to help defend the island if needed. The United States also is Taiwan's main arms supplier. Beijing broke off military contacts with Washington last year to protest another arms sale to Taiwan. The sale included more than $6 billion in Patriot missiles, Black Hawk helicopters and communications equipment, which Taiwan said it needed for self-defense.","Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi meets with Secretary of State Clinton in New York .

"Boise, Idaho (CNN) -- Five American soldiers have been charged with killing Afghan civilians for sport and staging the slayings to look like legitimate war casualties. The youngest of those five -- a now 20-year-old private from Idaho -- came home a changed man, his mother says. And, said Dana Holmes, the Army not only should have known something had gone dreadfully wrong, but commanding officers should be held responsible. ""The man that came home was not my son,"" said Holmes. ""He was very thin. He'd lost about 50 pounds. He said the Army told him he had a parasite. I made him his favorite sandwich, and it took him two days to eat the whole sandwich. Just couldn't eat; he didn't sleep."" Pfc. Andrew Holmes was a healthy, 185-pound 18-year-old when he joined the Army, his mother said. He came home on leave in April -- weeks before the Army launched an investigation into the suspected illegal drug use by his platoon, Bravo Company, 2nd Battalion, 1st Infantry Regiment, Fifth Brigade. Holmes' family had him hospitalized in Idaho to restore his strength. He told his mother that he gave himself daily IVs of fluids in Afghanistan to keep hydrated, a claim that horrifies his mother, who cannot believe the Army would not treat a soldier who was clearly ill. During his time on leave, she said, he was paranoid, always asking the family their whereabouts, concerned that someone was going to harm them. Shortly afterward, he returned to Afghanistan to rejoin his unit. ""I threatened to break his leg and keep him home, but he just hugged me and said, 'Mom, I've got a job to finish.' It was hard to put him on the plane. It was the first time I've seen him fall apart, when we put him on the plane. ... He was still hyper-vigilant about making sure we weren't alone,"" she said. And not long after Holmes returned to action, the Army launched its investigation, which quickly grew in scope -- with a new main focus on the murder of Afghan civilians. Now, Holmes and four others face numerous charges, including drug use, premeditated murder, possessing body parts and possessing photos of corpses. Seven others in the platoon are charged with various other crimes, from assaulting a fellow soldier who blew the whistle on the group's hashish smoking to collecting body parts as war trophies and posing them in grisly photos. Tapes describe killings for sport . Holmes and some of the others are being held at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington, where the platoon was based, to await courts-martial. Dana Holmes thinks the Army should be held accountable for what happened at that forward operating post in Afghanistan. ""If they were smoking that much hashish, you can smell it,"" she said. ""Where was the command? Did they just dump these boys off and say go forth and conquer?"" ""How did they know what was going on? My son was a healthy 18-year-old kid when he went over there, and now he is a mess. And I don't understand why the Army is not going after the officers."" The highest-ranking soldier accused is a staff sergeant, Calvin Gibbs. His attorney has declined comment on the numerous charges Gibbs faces, including premeditated murder. He has not entered a plea. Reports show Army sgt. tracked kills with tattoos . Gibbs has been depicted in documents and discussed in interrogation videos by some soldiers as the ringleader they feared. But no one above his rank has been charged with any offenses -- or, according to lawyers, disciplined for allegedly allowing the platoon to make up its own rules of war. Holmes is charged with the first reported civilian killing in January. He is accused of conspiring with Cpl. Jeremy Morlock to shoot at the civilian and then toss a grenade to look like the soldiers were under attack. Morlock's attorney disputes those accusations. ""As I stated before, my client through that period of time was suffering from brain damage,"" said Michael Waddington, a civilian attorney representing Morlock. ""He was treated, not properly treated by a cocktail of drugs, given to him by the military. ""Our defense is not that three people were not shot. I don't think that that's in dispute at this point. ...There is a question of who shot them, whether or not my client was mentally responsible at the time of the shootings and what role he played in the shootings."" Holmes is also charged with smoking hashish, possessing a dismembered human finger and wrongfully possessing photos of human casualties. His civilian lawyer, Dan Conway, said his client did not kill any civilian and was ordered by his supervisor, Gibbs, to keep a human finger. ""All I can speak for is the charge Pfc. Andrew Holmes is associated with, and I'll tell you that there is no proof that ... Holmes caused or conspired to cause the death of any human being unlawfully,'' Conway said. The Army refuses to comment on any aspect of any of the cases and has sought to limit circulation of evidence, especially since videotaped interrogations of some of the soldiers and alleged written confessions by some soldiers were obtained and reported by media outlets, including CNN. But it was the Army's own charging documents that portrayed a platoon gone rogue. In explicit detail the Army wrote how killings were staged -- how a fellow soldier was beaten and how Gibbs threw human fingers at another soldier believed to have snitched about the group's hashish smoking. It even charged one soldier with possessing a human skull. The charges drew media attention from around the world. The Army's response: mostly silence. The Army moved to restrict attorney access to what has been described to CNN by some who have seen them as a series to a series of gruesome photos of dead Afghans by allowing inspection of the material only at a secure facility in Lewis-McChord. A number of attorneys have objected, telling CNN the Army is limiting their ability to defend their clients because it is more concerned how the charges are being played in the media and perceived in Afghanistan. The Army even ordered military attorneys to return photos and documents that may have ""inadvertently"" been sent to them. Those who have seen the photos say they are worse than those depicting Iraqi prisoners in humiliating poses at the infamous Abu Ghraib prison. ""These remain allegations,"" said Geoff Morrell, a spokesman for the Defense Department. ""They are abhorrent, even as allegations. But I think they are, they are an aberration in terms of the behavior of our force, thankfully, and so I don't think they are in any way representative of how, you know, American military men and women behave in the field. ""But let's let this trial take place, and let's see what judgment is ultimately rendered. And talk to the Army about whether there's a larger effort to try to look into the chain-of-command issues,"" Morrell said. CNN tried to pose questions about those chain-of-command issues with both Army Secretary John McHugh and Army Chief of Staff Gen. George W. Casey Jr. but received only a brief email in response: . ""The secretary and chief are going to decline the opportunity to do the interview."" Soldier blew whistle on platoon . That doesn't surprise Dana Holmes, who said the Army has ignored the soldiers and their families in this case from the beginning. She said her son insisted on having an attorney present for his questioning and was placed under guard for weeks and told he did not need one. Eventually he agreed to talk, but Conway said he was tricked into doing so, believing he was receiving representation when he was not. Christopher Winfield, the father of another soldier charged with murder, told CNN he tried to report to the Army that his son had told him about the first murder, only to be ignored by the Army. Two more civilians died, according to the timeline provided by the Army in its charging documents. Winfield said that if the Army had heeded his calls for help those civilians might be alive and his son would not be in trouble. The Army is now investigating his allegations that he tried to alert the Army. Warning may have been ignored . Spc. Adam Winfield is charged with premeditated murder, although he is seen in an interrogation tape saying he fired his rifle but aimed high and missed. His lawyer, Eric Montalvo, said his client is not guilty of premeditated murder despite what his client told investigators on the videotaped interrogation. Dana Holmes said she doesn't believe anything the Army says. ""I hold the Army responsible for this whole mess,"" she said. ""Especially now that the Winfields have come forward and said they warned them about all this. This was going on and the Army chose to do nothing about it."" Pfc. Holmes' attorney said he plans to put on a vigorous defense of his client, arguing that he killed no one. And he said he plans to ask serious questions about the Army's command of a platoon that everyone agrees went terribly astray. ""The only way these kind of allegations can occur is the command is completely derelict in supervising, meaning not there, or they're ignoring that this kind of conduct may be occurring,"" Conway said. ""And I don't know which one it is at this point."" CNN's Todd Schwarzschild and Courtney Yager contributed to this report.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A nearly 9-hour flight delay turned into a standoff at Hong Kong airport Wednesday, with passengers refusing to leave the plane for 5-hours until the airline agreed to higher compensation. The incident underscores just how high tensions can rise in modern air travel with passengers and airlines jockeying it out in a low-frill, high-fee world. There is no global standard for passenger compensation in the case of airline delays and wide gulf can exist between passenger expectations and airline offers. When Hong Kong Airlines flight 752 from Singapore arrived at 530 a.m. Wednesday morning, the airline says 80 passengers refused to get off. The travelers, mainly members of package tours from mainland China, demanded the airline increase the original compensation offer of $50 per passenger. Twenty-one of the passengers stayed on board for another five hours, requesting reimbursement for the unused hotel rooms they had paid for the night before. The airport police were called in to negotiate and the passengers finally at 10:25 a.m., after the airline agreed to pay them $150. Hong Kong's I-Cable News quoted one passenger who said it wasn't the money, but the attitude of the airline that irked them. This isn't the first such incident in Hong Kong. The Standard newspaper reported in February that a group of Mainland tourists staged an all-night protest in the airport over flight delays. Hong Kong Airlines spokesperson Eva Chan blamed the incident on cultural differences. ""Our air staff never had any bad attitude towards the passenger,"" she said. ""They tried to negotiate and explain that the compensation policy of HK airlines is different from mainland Chinese airlines."" The irate travelers would likely have been better off if they had been traveling within the European Union. The EU requires passengers be compensated between $330 and $800 if their flight is delayed by two hours or more, depending on the flight length. However, the airline can claim exclusion for ""extraordinary circumstances,"" including weather and security incidences. The United States has no federal regulation on delay compensation, but it has instituted regulations that penalize airlines if passengers are stuck in a plane on the tarmac for more than three hours. The Department Transportation just fined an American Airlines' subsidiary $900,000, in the first penalty since the regulations went into effect last year.","A nearly 9-hour flight delay turned into a standoff at Hong Kong airport Wednesday .

"Ercis, Turkey (CNN) -- The death toll from the massive earthquake that shook eastern Turkey over the weekend rose to 535 Thursday, up from 471 the day before, but crews have been able to rescue 185 people alive from the rubble, Turkish officials said. In addition, about 2,300 people were injured by the 7.2-magnitude earthquake that struck Sunday, according to the Turkish Disaster and Emergency Relief Agency. Meanwhile, crews rescued 18-year-old Imdat Padak alive from the rubble of an apartment building in Ercis almost 100 hours after the earthquake, the semi-official Anatolian new agency reported. After teams from Azerbaijan retrieved him, Padak was taken to a hospital for initial treatment, and then was airlifted by helicopter to Van. Padak appeared not to have any significant trauma, but was suffering dehydration. He is reported to be a student from the village of Kiziloren and was taking courses while preparing for university entrance exams. Earlier in the week, crews pulled a 2-week-old baby, Azra Karaduman, alive from the debris. The developments came as there were reports of a moderate earthquake in the country's south. A 5.2 earthquake hit about 200 kilometers (125 miles) south of the center of Sunday's quake, near the border with Iraq, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. There were no immediate reports of damage from the latest quake. Padak was the latest of several people found alive in the rubble days after Sunday's quake.

"(EW.com) -- Kelly Clarkson will turn 30 next year. By then, ""Idol's"" favorite ex-waitress will have grown from America's sweetheart (see: 2004's ""Breakaway"") to a slightly goth brooder (2007's ""My December"") to pop's resident angry grrrl (2009's ""All I Ever Wanted"") right before the proud eyes of Mom and Dad -- or as we call them, Paula and Simon. In 2011, she's still young enough to pull off gleefully bratty kiss-offs like ''Einstein,'' on which she does the math for a no-good boyfriend: ''Dumb plus dumb equals you.''

'Once Upon A Time' premiere review: Did this fairy-tale show makes your dreams come true? The excellent pink-bubblegum explosion ''I Forgive You'' plays like a heartfelt postscript to the guy who left her in ''Since U Been Gone,'' with Clarkson's lived-through-this vocals making the lyrics even more poignant: ''We were just a couple of kids...no shame, no blame.'' She's got Gwen Stefani's just-a-girl strut down on ''You Can't Win,'' a punchy guitar rave-up about making peace with your inner walking disaster. Best of all is ''What Doesn't Kill You (Stronger),'' a throbbing glitter-disco tribute to believing that it really does get better.

"(CNN) -- The number of deaths linked to cantaloupes contaminated with the Listeria monocytogenes bacteria has risen to 28, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday. A total of 133 people in 26 states have been infected, according to the CDC. Additionally, a woman who was pregnant at the time of her illness had a miscarriage. Although health officials have said it is too early to declare the outbreak over, the number of new cases is falling. ""The peak in illnesses appears to have occurred from late August until the middle of September,"" Dr. Barbara Mahon of the CDC said last week, adding that additional monitoring will be needed for at least another two weeks. The grower, Jensen Farms of Granada, Colorado, issued a voluntary recall of its Rocky Ford brand cantaloupes on September 14. The tainted cantaloupes should be off store shelves, the CDC has said. Unsanitary conditions at the Colorado cantaloupe farm's packing facility are a possible contributing cause of one of the nation's worst outbreaks of listeria contamination in food, health officials have said. The listeria outbreak is the deadliest food-borne illness outbreak in the United States since 1998. Groups at high risk for listeria include older adults, people with weakened immune systems and pregnant women. Cantaloupes from Jensen Farms should be disposed of immediately, even if some of them have been partially eaten, the agency recommended. If consumers are uncertain about the source of a cantaloupe, they are urged to ask their supermarket. If the source remains unknown, the fruit should be thrown out. Refrigerating a cantaloupe will not kill the bacteria, which can grow at low temperatures, and consumers should not try to wash off the bacteria.","At least 133 cases have been reported in 26 states .

"(CNN) -- Fernando Alonso has targeted a ""very different 2012"" after his finish in the final grand prix of the Formula One season meant he ended 2011 in fourth place in the drivers' standings. The Spaniard narrowly missed out on the title in 2010 and was expected to prove a major challenger to Sebastian Vettel's crown but he only won one race all season -- at the British Grand Prix. Ferrari have toiled behind Red Bull and McLaren throughout the entire campaign, Alonso finishing 135 points behind Vettel while his team lagged 275 points behind Red Bull in the constructors' race. And the two-time world champion says his team must improve next year. Webber claims first win of 2011 in Brazil . ""In terms of team work we grew a lot in 2011 and we must absolutely make this the starting point for a very different 2012,"" Alonso told Ferrari's official website. ""If I had to score our performance, I can but repeat what Ferrari president (Luca di) Montezemolo said, giving us something between a five and six, but all the same I am proud of what the team was able to do. ""We need a car that is about five or six tenths quicker: achieving that won't be a walk in the park, but I have every confidence in our engineers and in a team that dominated the last decade in Formula One and holds every possible record in this sport. ""Let us not forget that I managed to get on the podium ten times and to score more points than last year. ""Losing out on third in the drivers' championship is definitely not a big problem: first place is the only one that really counts."" Final Formula One standings . Alonso's performance at the season-ending Brazilian Grand Prix mirrored his campaign as he trailed the Red Bull pair of Vettel -- who secured the 2011 title with four races remaining -- and Mark Webber, who won his first race of the season. Alonso held third for a time before Jenson Button's McLaren proved too fast for him, and says he couldn't extract any more from his car. He added: ""Yet another race in which we did everything to perfection, from the start to the strategy and the work of the team. The final result is more down to the performance of the others than our own, because we could not have done more. ""I was not fighting closely with other drivers, but it would certainly have helped me gain a few tenths while overtaking.

"(CNN) -- An investigation is under way into a previously unrevealed incident last week in which two jetliners nearly collided over Hong Kong, aviation authorities said Tuesday. The September 18 incident reportedly did not come to light publicly until an article revealing it was published Tuesday in the English-language newspaper The Standard of Hong Kong. The two jets, carrying more than 600 passengers and crew members, came within seconds of colliding, the newspaper reported, citing a former Hong Kong aviation official. According to a statement issued by Hong Kong's Civil Aviation Department, a Cathay Pacific Airways flight that was bound for Hong Kong International Airport came within 1 nautical mile (2 km) of a Dragonair A330 airplane that was in a holding pattern for landing. The international standard for separation between aircraft is 5 nautical miles (9.26 kilometers) horizontally or 1,000 feet (304) meters vertically), the department said. The incident happened during a stormy afternoon when aircraft were stacked up for landing over Hong Kong, the department said. An air traffic controller was trying to shuffle waiting aircraft around so that the Cathay Pacific flight, which was low on fuel, could land more quickly. That's when controllers noticed the flights were too close. The pilots of both aircraft failed to respond to commands to change course at one point or another during the incident, the department said. Collision avoidance systems on both aircraft activated after the crew of the Cathay Pacific flight failed to respond to a command to climb to a higher altitude. Cathay Pacific said in a statement that ""both Cathay Pacific and Dragonair pilots had taken appropriate actions under the circumstances to re-establish standard separation between the two aircraft."" The pilots could see each other's planes during the incident and there was no risk of collision, the department and Cathay Pacific said. But The Standard quoted Hong Kong's former civil aviation chief Albert Lam Kwong-yu as saying that, based on normal speeds of the airliners involved, they were about six seconds from colliding. ""The chance of a crash is absolutely high,"" the paper quoted Lam as saying. ""The passengers really came back from hell."" The flights involved were Cathay 841 from New York to Hong Kong, and Dragonair 433 from Kaoshiung, Taiwan, to Hong Kong. The Cathay jet had 317 people aboard and the Dragonair jet had 296 aboard, according to aviation officials. Investigators have ruled out air traffic controller fatigue as a cause of the near-collision, the department said. The air controller in charge of the flights was appropriately rested and has since returned to work, the agency said. Investigators will examine air traffic procedures, staffing levels and flight crew operations, the department said. Hong Kong has been the site of four other near-collision incidents in the last 11 years. -- In September 2010, a Cathay Pacific plane taking off for London after midnight had to deviate from the runway center line at high speed because the tail of another plane was too close to its path. -- In July 2006, a Dragonair Airbus and a Northwest Airlines Boeing -- both heading for Tokyo -- were reported to be just 100 meters apart vertically while 80 nautical miles east of the Hong Kong airport. -- In September 2004, a China Southern Airlines plane leaving Hong Kong and an incoming Malaysia Airlines cargo plane came within 304 meters of each other 55 nautical miles south of the airport. -- In June 2001, a Dragonair Airbus to Shanghai and a Cathay Pacific flight arriving from Seoul were reported 210 meters apart 110 nautical miles east of Hong Kong.","An investigation is under way into a near-collision last week over Hong Kong .

"(CNN) -- Foreign ministry officials in Mali said Saturday three people from other countries were kidnapped Friday, while a fellow foreigner who was killed was probably German. The incidents in northern Mali are the latest in a series targeting Westerners in recent days, with France confirming Thursday that one person had been killed and five kidnapped elsewhere in the West African nation. Friday's abductions and killing occurred in the northern Timbuktu province of Mali. A spokesman at the German Foreign Office told CNN there was ""a high probability"" that the foreigner killed was a German citizen. ""No further German has been involved in the abductions,"" the spokesman said. Ward Bezemer, a spokesman at the Dutch Foreign Ministry, confirmed that one Dutchman had been kidnapped. And Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt confirmed via Twitter that a Swede was among those seized. ""Entire region becoming even more dangerous,"" he posted. Media reports suggest the third person kidnapped Friday is a South African who lives in the UK. A British Foreign Office spokeswoman told CNN: ""We are aware of the reports and we are urgently looking into them to establish the facts."" The British Foreign Office advices against all travel to northern Mali, which encompasses part of the Sahel region that lies south of the Sahara desert. EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton condemned the kidnappings in a statement Saturday. ""I was appalled to learn of the death of one person yesterday,"" she said. ""I offer my deep condolences to the family and friends of the victim and my solidarity with all the hostages currently being held in the Sahel. ""I call on the Malian authorities to do their utmost to ensure that the hostages are quickly and safely released.

"Washington (CNN) -- To hear Paul Ryan explain it, there's just one way to cope with becoming the Democrats' favorite man to hate: ""I gave fear up for Lent this year,"" Ryan told CNN during an extensive interview. And he's not kidding. It's probably a good idea, given the fact that Ryan's budget -- passed nearly unanimously by House Republicans -- has become the GOP Holy Grail. It includes entitlement cuts, most notably the gradual shifting of Medicare into a program dominated by private insurers. It's no surprise, then, that Democrats call it dangerous, mean and reckless -- and that's not all. ""The Ryan road map is the way to the cliff and then over the cliff,"" said Rep. John Yarmuth. D-Kentucky. ""The Ryan proposal would destroy our government,"" economist and Columbia University professor Jeffrey Sachs declared at a Democratic Progressive Caucus event. Ryan remains undeterred. ""There's a big test to this country and whether we apply our country's principles -- you know liberty, free enterprise, self-determination, government by the consent of the governed -- all of these really core principles are being tested right now,"" Ryan told CNN. ""You can't have fear if you try to fix these problems."" The 41-year-old Ryan has been on a fast track. First elected to Congress in 1998 after a stint as a congressional staffer and adviser at the conservative think tank Empower America, the Janesville, Wisconsin, native ran for the House at the ripe old age of 28. It was a long shot, but he won, convincingly. Always a fiscal conservative, Ryan made his mark delving into the nuance of federal budgets. Now he's become famous as the face of a new brand of Republican economics -- one that includes the most sweeping plan to cut government spending in decades and enact major entitlement reforms. As evidence of his growing influence in the party, the Republican National Committee on Friday tapped Ryan to be its Presidential Trust Chairman to lead its fundraising effort against President Barack Obama. Ryan had the deficit in his sights for years. At first, even Republicans steered clear of some of his more controversial budget ideas like Medicare reform. But then the economy went south and the tea party became the rage. Suddenly, the push to slash budget deficits became popular. So popular, in fact, that Ryan's budget outline overwhelmingly passed the Republican-controlled House in the spring. It cuts $6.2 trillion over 10 years in federal government spending. That's big bucks, and Ryan does it by gradually transforming Medicare into a program in which recipients receive vouchers to help buy private insurance. He also gradually raises the program's eligibility age and transforms Medicaid into a block grant program. On the tax side, the Ryan plan includes major tax reform that reduces the top rate for both individuals and corporations. The plan died in the Senate and handed the Democrats a political issue. ""...His budget would kill people. No question,"" Princeton University and Nobel Prize -inning economist Paul Krugman told CNN. ""The cuts in Medicare he's proposing, the replacement of Medicare by a voucher system would in the end mean that tens of millions of Americans would not be able to afford essential health care. So that counts as cruelty to me."" Ryan scoffs at the criticism. ""There's sort of a shoot-the-messenger strategy these days,"" he added. ""I'm the messenger, and you can't fear that if you are who you are."" It's a pattern for Ryan, who has grown in popularity by pushing the unpopular, a fairly unconventional route. Not only has he proposed major reforms in entitlements; he's also tried to end his colleagues' pork projects. When he became chairman of the House Budget Committee this year after Republicans captured control of the House, he continued to touch the untouchable-- the third rail of American politics. ""I used to say I'm like a koala bear grabbing on. So here's the problem: if you don't address these issues now, they're going to steamroll us as a country, and the issue the more you delay fixing these problems, the much uglier the solutions are going to be,"" he told CNN. ""Fifty-one percent of Medicare right now is funded with borrowed money, and so if we're going to keep the promise, you have to change it for our generation. You have to change it for those of us in the X Generation that won't have a program when we retire."" It's become the mantra of the GOP, including presidential candidates. So when former House Speaker Newt Gingrich criticized Ryan's plan as ""right-wing social engineering,"" in a television appearance in May, it created an immediate furor. Gingrich was forced to take the comments back. He called Ryan within days to say he was wrong and misspoke, according to Ryan. Apology accepted. The other GOP candidates have supported his ideas -- although with some nuances, because the notion of changing entitlements is a controversial proposition for a presidential candidate. Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who has not backed away from his comments calling Social Security a ""Ponzi scheme,"" said he and Ryan talked recently about the program and the need to reform it. Speaking at an Iowa event, Perry said he told Ryan, ""'hank you for having the courage to stand up and being, talking about this,' and I said, 'I am proud to join you in this discussion with America for clearly calling the Social Security program that we have in place today broken.'"" Last week on Laura Ingraham's radio show, Ryan said he didn't think the program is a criminal enterprise but is operating like a Ponzi scheme. ""It's a pay-as-you-go system where earlier investors, or, say, taxpayers, get a positive rate of return... and later investors, or taxpayers, get a negative rate of return,"" he said, according to a partial transcript. ""And so ... that is how those schemes work. The point is, unless you fix this problem, it's going to get much worse."" And how would Ryan make Social Security financially sustainable? By gradually raising the eligibility age, tying the benefits for more wealthy recipients to inflation and offering workers under the age of 55 the option of investing some of their taxes into personal retirement accounts. Say what you will about Ryan's willingness to take on sacrificial lambs, he is not shy about pushing controversial proposals -- and that's a rarity in Washington. ""He is a guy without guile, without pretense. He likes to hang out with actuaries for relaxation,"" conservative commentator and CNN analyst Bill Bennett said in an interview. Ryan worked for Bennett at Empower America. And there's more to Ryan than the D.C. wonk. He's also a hunter who can target elk with a bow and arrow. And he's an exercise buff -- when in Washington, he works out each morning with some of his congressional colleagues using a grueling fitness routine called P90X. One favorite pastime: trekking the Colorado Rockies. His devotion to fitness was spurred by the early death of his father at age 55 when Ryan was 16. ""I basically had to learn to sink and swim,"" he recalled. ""I did a lot of growing up very fast. And it made me take stock of who I am, what kind of person I want to be. It made me, I would say, very initiative-prone -- live life to its fullest because you never know how long it is going to last."" Ryan was pushed again this summer to run for the Republican presidential nomination by assorted GOP luminaries. His answer: No, not yet. ""I think there are other good people who can do this job,"" he told CNN. ""But there are not other good people who can raise my kids."" -- CNN's Katie Ross and Eric Marrapodi contributed to this report.","Paul Ryan's budget was passed nearly unanimously by House Republicans .

"(CNN) -- Moroccans went to the polls Friday in the country's first parliamentary elections since adopting a new constitution following mass protests over unemployment and corruption. Turnout in the North African country was 45%, the Interior Ministry said. Both Parliament and the prime minister have greater powers under the new constitution, while the monarch's sway has been slightly lessened. More than 300 international observers monitored the voting, alongside 3,500 Moroccan observers, the semiofficial Le Matin newspaper reported. Morocco's moderate Islamist Justice and Development Party (PJD) is expected to do well in the vote. Lise Storm, senior lecturer in Middle East Politics at the University of Exeter in England, told CNN the elections were important because ""they are exciting for the first time."" After years in which the results have been predictable, this time more is at stake and the outcome may signal whether the population is happy with the monarchy or not, Storm said. If people voted for the bloc of traditional loyalist parties, that would suggest they want to maintain the status quo, she said, whereas more votes for the PJD would signal a desire for greater change. ""We don't know who's going to win for once,"" she said. Zeineb, 29, a business owner in Casablanca who would give only her first name, told CNN she did not expect a great deal to change as a result of the elections. ""I don't expect this to be a historical turn,"" she said. ""I am waiting for real changes from the government. As long as parties controlled by the palace will be around, and Mounir Majidi, the king's private secretary, will dominate the economy, nothing will change for me."" She said the PJD's pledge to fight corruption was appealing but she does not subscribe to its ideology, so her vote was likely to go to the Socialist Union of Popular Forces as the ""less bad"" option. Others were less motivated to use their ballot. ""I am not going to vote for people who don't care about my fate,"" one taxi driver said. ""Today, I am not going to the polls. I am staying home."" The elections were first set for September 2012, but they were rescheduled after negotiations between the Interior Ministry, which oversees elections, and some 20 political parties. Under the constitutional changes approved in July, the country's prime minister must now be chosen from the party that wins the greatest number of votes, rather than King Mohammed VI selecting his own nominee for the job. However, he is not obliged to choose the leader of the winning party, Storm said, which gives him more room to maneuver. Also, the number of political parties involved means that a coalition government is almost inevitable, she said. The PJD is more moderate than Turkey's governing Justice and Development Party or the Islamists who won power in Tunisian elections last month, Storm said. The constitutional changes came after thousands of Moroccans took to the streets to demonstrate earlier this year, inspired by what became known as the Arab Spring. The youth-based February 20 Movement called for jobs and an end to corruption its members say stems from royal cronies. Economic reform is needed to create more jobs for the country's young people, particularly many university graduates who are unemployed, Storm said. Journalist Aida Alami in Casablanca contributed to this report.","NEW: Turnout is 45%, the Interior Ministry says .

"(CNN) -- Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner became Latin America's first female president to win a second term when she sailed to victory in Argentina's elections. With 98% of votes counted Monday, Fernandez was the decisive winner, obtaining nearly 54% of votes cast and far surpassing her closest competitor. Hermes Binner, a Socialist governor from Santa Fe, came in second place with almost 17% of the votes. Economic issues played a large role in Sunday's vote, political analyst Carlos Germano told CNN en EspaÃ±ol. South America's second-largest economy has bounced back from the brink and shaped a most unlikely recovery, driven by high commodities demand from China and a series of unorthodox economic policies that worked to help shelter Argentina from much of the economic malaise that is gripping the rest of the planet right now. Under Fernandez's leadership, Argentina's economy has enjoyed sustained growth of about 8% annually. The president points to this expansion and a low debt load as examples of how Argentina is well-positioned to weather the uncertainty in the current global markets. Fernandez's win was a sign that Argentinians want to see economic growth continue, Germano said. ""It was an overwhelming vote to preserve what we have in light of the imminence of the problems that we are seeing in the United States and Europe,"" he said. Fernandez, a center-left member of the Peronist party, went into Sunday's vote as the undisputed front-runner after handily winning the primary vote. Continuously weaving her role as the nation's leader with being the widow of former president Nestor Carlos Kirchner, who died in 2010, Fernandez said she carries her husband's ideals as she returns to office. Fernandez, 58, has said her second presidential term will be dedicated to her late husband's memory. ""Today is a rare day for me, because there are too many feelings,"" Fernandez said as results came in Sunday night. ""If I tell you I am happy, I lie, if I tell you I am sad, I lie. ... I am not speaking as his widow but as his partner in militancy for the rest of my life,"" she said. In 2007, Kirchner stepped aside so his wife, Fernandez, could run. She was elected with 45% of the vote, becoming Argentina's first elected female president. Thousands crammed into Buenos Aires' Plaza de Mayo waving flags and shouting ""Viva Cristina, Viva Peronismo!' to welcome back their charismatic leader. Entire families and groups of activists cheered as results trickled in showing the incumbent president with a considerable advantage over her opponents. But Binner and his party still had a significant showing in Sunday's election, Germano said. ""I think it's a force with the possibility of growing both in the short and long term,"" he said. Binner told supporters Sunday that he had congratulated Kirchner on her win, Argentina's official Telam news agency reported. But he vowed that his party will keep fighting for its progressive beliefs. ""We will be in the opposition. We will be the ones who make alternative proposals, but we will be relentless,"" he said, according to Telam. CNN's Guillermo Fontana and Brian Byrnes contributed to this report.","Analyst: Economic issues played a large role in the voters' choice .

"(CNN) -- With more than 5 million people suffering from Alzheimer's disease in the United States, a number that's expected to rise to 16 million by 2050, the pressure is on to find better methods of diagnosis, treatment and prevention. Around the world, Alzheimer's disease is the second most feared disease, behind cancer, according to a recent survey of five countries conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health. Yet there is still a lot of misinformation: Only 61% of Americans who responded to the survey correctly identified Alzheimer's disease as a fatal illness. Many participants also mistakenly believe there are sure diagnostic methods and effective treatments to slow the disease, but most would seek medical attention if they became aware of their own early signs. The research that came out of the Alzheimer's Association 2011 International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease, which took place in Paris last week, reflects a growing emphasis on early detection. Research suggests the best targets for exploring treatments are patients who do not have full-blown Alzheimer's disease, but experience mild symptoms. Scientists have identified biological indicators called biomarkers that seem to be associated with Alzheimer's, although they are not perfect predictors. Alzheimer's Association: 10 signs of Alzheimer's . ""Things are heading earlier and earlier. And the use of biomarkers has been really essential for helping everybody move toward an understanding of what the earliest changes are and when they can be detected,"" said Dr. Allan Levey, chair of neurology at Emory University School of Medicine. Early detection . So far, no drug has been developed to significantly slow the progression of the disease in all patients. And there's no way to halt or reverse the decline of memory and other cognitive abilities once Alzheimer's has been diagnosed. Since attempts to help patients who already have symptoms in these ways have failed, scientists must look to the earliest stages of Alzheimer's in hopes of stopping it before it begins. Studies presented at the conference reinforced the notion that signs of Alzheimer's may develop in the brain 10 to 20 years before any symptoms begin. A substance in the brain called beta-amyloid has been associated with dementia in people who have those kinds of symptoms. This is the main ingredient of plaques that build up in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. People with a rare genetic form of Alzheimer's, whose specific genetic mutations guarantee that they will develop the disease, tended to show signs of amyloid plaques in PET scans and cerebrospinal fluid 10 to 20 years before the onset of symptoms. These results come from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network project. But that represents only a small fraction of Alzheimer's patients -- 1% of cases worldwide, specifically. If you don't have the genetic form, there's no way to tell if you will go on to develop the disease, even if you have accumulation of amyloid plaques. There are some people who have them but do not show symptoms of Alzheimer's. The kinds of tests that would detect beta-amyloid levels are not widely available. And it's not clear that pulling the amyloid plaques out of the brain reverses the process of cognitive decline; this is one area of research right now. Another biomarker of interest is a protein called tau, implicated in the neurofibrillary tangles -- which basically take the shape of cells and destroy them -- that build up in the brains of Alzheimer's patients, particularly in the memory center called the hippocampus. But there's no scan to detect these tangles in a living patient. A major focus of research on early detection is patients who have mild cognitive impairment, a collection of symptoms involving difficulty with memory, language and other mental functions, but which does not interfere with everyday life. It is not necessarily a precursor to Alzheimer's disease, but it does raise the risk of progressing into that more severe illness. Understanding mild cognitive impairment is important in coming up with better treatments for dementia in general, because the brain hasn't deteriorated as much as in Alzheimer's, so it may not be too late to intervene, experts say. The brain is the primary organ the disease attacks, but a small study presented at the conference suggests the eyes may also reveal signs of Alzheimer's. Researchers looked at photos of retinal blood vessels and found some differences in Alzheimer's patients, but further research is needed to confirm this idea of using an eye exam to help diagnose Alzheimer's. The same holds for a study suggesting that falling is indicative of Alzheimer's early stages: It's a preliminary idea that needs further investigation. Identifying risk and prevention factors . Another area of focus is identifying risk factors for Alzheimer's disease. These are associations, not known direct causes. ""Age is a risk factor we can't modify, at least yet. Our genetics, we can't modify yet, which is another major risk factor,"" Levey said. ""But certainly seeking clues about ones that are modifiable is an important"" research area. At the Paris conference, researchers said 3 million cases of Alzheimer's could be prevented worldwide if lifestyle-based, chronic disease risk factors were reduced by 25%. This estimate is based on a mathematical model. In the United States, physical inactivity had the biggest association with Alzheimer's out of the risk factors studied, followed by depression and smoking. Midlife hypertension, midlife obesity, low educational attainment and diabetes are other risk factors. ""If we can demonstrate that these risk factors can be modified, and that it will lead to lower rates of Alzheimer's disease, the impact could be huge,"" Levey said. People in their 40s and 50s have still got perhaps a couple of decades to modify lifestyle to potentially lower risk, he said. There is also growing evidence that head trauma may increase the risk of dementia. One study presented at the conference in Paris found that traumatic brain injury was associated with dementia among older veterans. A study of former NFL players suggests that football players also may be at increased risk for mild cognitive impairment or similar cognitive decline, perhaps as a result of repeated head injury during these former athletes' sports careers. In fact, 75 former professional football players are suing the NFL, alleging that the league concealed information about the harmful effects of concussions on the brain for decades. There is also the idea of cognitive reserve: that keeping the mind active can at least delay the onset of dementia. It also seems that intelligence might help the brain stay in the mild phase of the disease longer, although more study needs to be done in this area as well. ""We know that highly intelligent people have more tolerance to plaque buildup and to loss of energy in their brains than people with lower levels of intelligence and less education,"" said Dr. Steven DeKosky, vice president and dean of the University of Virginia's School of Medicine, at an Alzheimer's forum at the National Press Foundation in May. ""Their brain basically fights it off and finds some other ways to get the things done."" Caregiving . One of the underappreciated effects of Alzheimer's disease is how great a toll it takes on caregivers. Caregivers are much more frequently ill and die earlier than people who do not care for someone with the disease, studies have shown. The stress of taking care of someone chronically ill is sometimes called caregiver syndrome. Caregiving is hazardous to health because of the stress of helping Alzheimer's patients, and because caregivers may ignore their own health, DeKosky said. ""Alzheimer's patients, when they get into moderate and severe stages, don't have some real sense of time,"" DeKosky said. ""They have to be watched every minute."" Patients may hurt themselves or wander off if not under constant supervision. And it's common for patients to reverse their sleeping and waking cycles, so caregivers' daily habits are likewise disrupted. The cost is staggering: Caregivers provide more than $200 billion in unpaid care, 17 billion hours each year, according to the Alzheimer's Association. Gibbons' advice to Alzheimer's caregivers: Breathe, believe and receive . Why don't we know more? Two of the biggest obstacles to finding treatments for Alzheimer's disease are lack of money and difficulty enrolling people in clinical trials, experts say. The United States spends $450 million each year in Alzheimer's research money, compared to $6 billion for cancer, $4 billion for heart disease and $3 billion for HIV/AIDS research. In spite of the money that does exist for research, Alzheimer's clinical trials are hard to fill with participants, said Dr. R. Scott Turner, director of the Georgetown University Memory Disorders Program. Sometimes people believe they're just having ""senior moments"" and don't want to acknowledge their illness, Turner said. In other cases, patients don't want to go through the hassle of the trial if they're not guaranteed to receive an experimental drug; but, in order for a scientific study to be valid, patients must be randomly assigned to either the drug or a placebo. Also, some trials don't test drugs at all, but simply look for those biomarkers that may help predict disease later or explore other early diagnostic methods. Such methods will be in high demand when an effective treatment is developed, DeKosky said. ""When the first drug is successful, let's say in symptomatic disease -- may it be so -- the crush to take advantage of what we know, while it's still in research format now, will be immense,"" DeKosky said. If you or a loved one are interested in exploring clinical trials, the Alzheimer's Association runs a system called TrialMatch to assist in finding a trial near you.

"(Rolling Stone) -- ""Like a Rolling Stone"" (Highway 61 Revisited, 1965) By Bono . That sneer -- it's something to behold. Elvis had a sneer, of course. And the Rolling Stones had a sneer that, if you note the title of the song, Bob wasn't unaware of. But Bob Dylan's sneer on ""Like a Rolling Stone"" turns the wine to vinegar. It's a black eye of a pop song. The verbal pugilism on display here cracks open songwriting for a generation and leaves the listener on the canvas. ""Like a Rolling Stone"" is the birth of an iconoclast that will give the rock era its greatest voice and vandal. This is Bob Dylan as the Jeremiah of the heart, torching romantic verse and ""the girl"" with a firestorm of unforgiving words. Having railed against the hypocrisies of the body politic, he now starts to pick on enemies that are a little more familiar: the scene, high society, the ""pretty people"" who think they've ""got it made."" He hasn't made it to his own hypocrisies -- that would come later. But the ""us"" and ""them"" are not so clearly defined as earlier albums. Here he bares his teeth at the hipsters, the vanity of that time, the idea that you had a better value system if you were wearing the right pair of boots. For some, the Sixties was a revolution. But there were others who were erecting a guillotine in Greenwich Village not for their political enemies, but rather for the squares. Bob was already turning on that idea, even as he best embodied it, with the corkscrew hair Jimi Hendrix would later admit to imitating. The tumble of words, images, ire and spleen on ""Rolling Stone"" shape-shifts easily into music forms 10 or 20 years away, like punk, grunge or hip-hop. Looking at the character in the lyric, you ask the question ""How quickly could she have plunged from high society to 'scrounging' for her 'next meal'?"" Perhaps it is a glance into the future; perhaps it's just fiction, a screenplay distilled into one song. It must have been hard to be or be around Dylan then; that unblinking eye was turning on everybody and everything. But for all the tirading, the real mischief is in its ear-biting humor. ""If you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose"" is the T-shirt. But the line that I like the best is ""You never turned around to see the frowns on the jugglers and the clowns/When they all did tricks for you/You never understood that it ain't no good/You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you."" The playing on this track -- by the likes of guitarist Mike Bloomfield and keyboardist Al Kooper -- is so alive and immediate that it's like you're getting to see the paint splash the canvas. As is often the case with Bob in the studio, the musicians don't fully know the song. It's like the first touch. They're getting to know it, and you can feel their joy of discovery as they're experiencing it. When the desire to communicate is met with an equal and opposite urge not to compromise in order to communicate -- those two things are in perfect balance -- is when everything happens with rock & roll. And that's what Dylan achieved in ""Rolling Stone."" I don't know or particularly care who this song is about -- though I've met a few people who have claimed it was about them (some who weren't even born in 1965). The real thrill for me was that ""once upon a time"" in the world, a song this radical was a hit on the radio. The world was changed by a cranky voice, a romantic spirit, somebody who cared enough about an unrequited love to write such a devastatingly caustic put-down. I love to hear a song that changes everything. That's the reason I'm in a band: David Bowie's ""Heroes,"" Arcade Fire's ""Rebellion (Lies),"" Joy Division's ""Love Will Tear Us Apart,"" Marvin Gaye's ""Sexual Healing,"" Nirvana's ""Smells Like Teen Spirit,"" Public Enemy's ""Fight the Power."" But at the top of this dysfunctional family tree sits the king of spitting fire himself, the juggler of beauty and truth, our own Willy Shakespeare in a polka-dot shirt. It's why every songwriter after him carries his baggage and why this lowly Irish bard would proudly carry his luggage. Any day. ""Mr. Tambourine Man"" (Bringing It All Back Home, 1965) By David Crosby . As far as I can tell, the Byrds' recording of ""Mr. Tambourine Man"" was the first time anyone put really good poetry on the radio. The Beatles hadn't gotten to ""Eleanor Rigby"" or ""A Day in the Life"" -- they were still writing ""Ooh, baby."" But Bob's lyrics were exquisite. ""To dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free"" -- that was the line that got me. At the time of ""Mr. Tambourine Man,"" I think he was finding himself as a poet. He was learning to be beautiful. I had seen Bob back at Gerde's Folk City in New York years earlier. Everyone was talking about him. I saw him play and thought, ""(Expletive), I can sing better than that. Why are they making all that fuss about him?"" Then I started really listening. And I almost quit, right there. Truthfully, I think the Byrds were Bob's best translators. Bob did not envision this song the way we did it. When he came to the studio where we were rehearsing and heard us do ""Mr. Tambourine Man,"" he was stoked. I think hearing our version was part of what made Dylan shift over to being a rocker. He thought, ""Wait a minute, that's my song,"" and he heard how it could be different. Copyright © 2011 Rolling Stone.","""Like a Rolling Stone"" is a black eye of a pop song .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A man who allegedly shot his ex-wife and seven other people to death in the deadliest shooting in Orange County, California, history pleaded not guilty Tuesday, prosecutors said. An Orange County Superior Court judge scheduled an April 24, 2012, preliminary hearing for Scott Evans Dekraai, 41. Dekraai is charged with eight counts of first-degree murder and a felony count of attempted murder in the October 12 shooting at the Salon Meritage hair salon in the small coastal community of Seal Beach, a district attorney's spokeswoman said. The first-degree murder charges carry the special circumstance of multiple murder. The attempted murder count is for a ninth victim who was wounded. Prosecutors said they will seek the death penalty. Dekraai is being held without bond. Dekraai and his ex-wife, Michelle Fournier, 48, were battling over custody of their 8-year-old son, and the dispute was the motive in the shooting, Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas said in October. The prosecutor called Dekraai ""a methodical and merciless killer."" On the morning of the shooting, Dekraai and Fournier got into an argument about child custody, authorities said. ""We're sort of guessing. We believe that the custody battle wasn't going well for him. We don't know the contents of their conversation or anything,"" Rackauckas said. Hours later, the gunfire rampage at the salon, just blocks from the ocean, unfolded, authorities said. ""He also considered the people who were friends and who worked with his ex-wife were enablers, and he didn't have much use for them either,"" Rackauckas said. The gunman was armed with three weapons -- a 9 mm Springfield, a Smith & Wesson .44 Magnum, and a Heckler & Koch .45 -- and was wearing body armor during the shooting rampage, Rackauckas said. He used at least two of those guns, the prosecutor said. Rackauckas summarized the mass shooting, saying Dekraai ""walked through the salon shooting anyone close enough to hit. He stopped to reload during this spree, and he continued gunning people down. He was not satisfied with murdering his intended target, his ex-wife. For almost two minutes, Dekraai shot victim after victim, executing people by shooting them in the head and chest. ""He shot eight people inside the salon. But he was not done. He then walked out of the salon and shot a ninth victim, a male who was sitting nearby in a parked Range Rover. The reason for this rampage: revenge,"" he said. ""We believe that the defendant committed this unimaginable act of violence because he wanted to kill his ex-wife over a custody dispute concerning their 8-year-old son. He was willing to end any life in his path, and he did. Clearly this two-minute murder spree could not have been about loving his son,"" the prosecutor said. While Dekraai allegedly carried out the mass murder, his son was sitting alone in the principal's office at school, waiting for his mother or father to pick him up, authorities said. ""That little boy is also a victim. He is now left to mourn the murder of his mother and grow up with the knowledge that his father (allegedly) committed a mass murder,"" Rackauckas said. ""What sick, twisted fatherly love is this?"" In addition to Fournier, of Los Alamitos, the people killed were salon employee Victoria Ann Buzzo, 54, of Laguna Beach; David Caouette, 64, of Seal Beach, who was in the vehicle outside the salon; salon employee Laura Lee Elody, 46, of Huntington Beach; salon owner Randy Lee Fannin, 62, of Murrieta; salon client Michele Daschbach Fast, 47, of Seal Beach; salon client Lucia Bernice Kondas, 65, of Huntington Beach; and salon employee Christy Lynn Wilson, 47, of Lakewood, authorities said. Dekraai allegedly shot Caouette, who was in the parked vehicle, in the head through a closed front passenger side window, authorities said. The ninth victim, Harriet Stretz, 73, of Los Alamitos was at the salon getting her hair done by her daughter, Laura Elody, who was among the victims. ""We do know that the victims were shot multiple times each,"" Rackauckas said. About 20 people were inside the salon during the shooting, and many of them were ""playing dead, hiding in back rooms, trying to get back behind things, just trying to stay out of his way,"" Rackauckas said. Police arrested Dekraai without incident as he was trying to leave the scene in a vehicle two blocks from the salon, police said. Dekraai was in possession of the three guns and ""a significant amount of ammunition in his truck,"" according to prosecutors. In the past several months, Fournier complained to Seal Beach police about Dekraai picking up their son from school earlier than the court-ordered mandate, Tim Olson of the Seal Beach police said. That matter was forwarded to family court, and Olson said he didn't know of the complaint's disposition. In 2007, in Long Beach, Dekraai's father-in-law applied for a temporary restraining order, but there was no follow-up, Rackauckas said. An online search of Orange County court records shows the couple filed for divorce in 2007. A child custody evaluator was appointed by the court in April, records show. Fournier said in court papers that Dekraai was mentally unstable, had threatened to kill himself or someone else and ""was almost manic when it comes to demanding absolute right to control our son,"" CNN affiliate KTLA said. The couple was in court the day before the shooting, and a judge had kept custody between them equal, KTLA said. In 1994, Dekraai filed for bankruptcy, according to court records. The Salon Meritage is located on the Pacific Coast Highway in Seal Beach, which residents describe as a small and ""fairly intimate"" coastal town. ""We have multiple years with zero homicides, so this obviously is an unusual and tragic circumstance,"" Seal Beach police Sgt. Steve Bowles said. The shooting is the deadliest in Orange County history. In 1976, Edward Charles Allaway shot nine people, killing seven, at California State University Fullerton. CNN's Traci Tamura, Gabriel Ramirez, Ashley Hayes and Carey Bodenheimer contributed to this report.","Scott Evans Dekraai, 41, is charged with killing his ex-wife and 7 others .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Doctors completed an autopsy of Moammar Gadhafi on Sunday, with the chief pathologist confirming the former Libyan leader died of a gunshot wound to the head. Dr. Othman el-Zentani would not disclose whether findings revealed if Gadhafi suffered the wound in crossfire or at close-range -- a key question that has prompted the United Nations and international human rights groups to call for an investigation into the final moments of the late Libyan strongman's life. Doctors performed the autopsy at a Misrata hospital in the presence of officials from the prosecutor's office, Zentani said. Autopsies were also conducted on the bodies of Gadhafi's son, Mutassim, and his former defense minister, Abu Baker Yunis. No foreign or independent officials were present, Zentani said. The autopsy report will go to the attorney general's office before it is released to the public, he said. Meanwhile, the three bodies would likely return to a cold storage unit at a Misrata meat market for public viewing, Zentani said. Long lines of people turned up all weekend long to view the corpses. Gadhafi's family issued a statement Friday calling on the United Nations and Amnesty International to push Libya's new leadership ""to hand over the bodies of the martyrs of their tribe so they can be buried according to Islamic rites,"" a pro-Gadhafi TV station reported. Gadhafi's death Thursday solidified the power of the National Transitional Council, which marked the country's liberation on Sunday in the eastern city of Benghazi, where the uprising started. But uncertainty was still swirling Sunday about the death of the Libyan leader, who Libyan and world powers wanted to capture and prosecute for war crimes. Leaders of Libya's interim government have said Gadhafi was killed in crossfire after fighters captured him Thursday. But others have questioned that account. Peter Bouckaert, Human Rights Watch's emergencies director, told CNN that fighting had ended when Gadhafi was cornered in a drainage ditch. He said crowds beat Gadhafi in what was a ""humiliating end"" for the former dictator. ""When he left the area, he was very much alive,"" Bouckaert said. ""There's no reason why he should have been subjected to this kind of mob justice."" An amateur video distributed by the Reuters news agency Sunday showed NTC fighters congratulating a man the fighters say killed Gadhafi. CNN could not independently verify that claim. The video, purportedly recorded near an ambulance carrying Gadhafi's body, shows a jubilant group of fighters pouring water on a man's head. ""He is the one who killed him,"" one man says, pointing. ""He killed him in front of me, I swear to God,"" another man chimes in. A lawyer for Gadhafi's son Saadi, who fled in September to Niger, issued a statement Sunday saying, ""Saadi Gadhafi is shocked and outraged by the vicious brutality which accompanied the murders of his father and brother."" ""The contradictory statements issued by the NTC excusing these barbaric executions and the grotesque abuse of the corpses make it clear that no person affiliated with the former regime will receive a fair trial in Libya nor will they receive justice for crimes committed against them,"" the statement said. Mahmoud Jibril, chairman of the NTC's executive board, has said Gadhafi's right arm was wounded when a gunbattle erupted between the fighters and Gadhafi loyalists as his captors attempted to load him into a vehicle. More shooting erupted as the vehicle drove away, and Gadhafi was shot in the head, dying moments before arriving at a hospital in Misrata, Jibril said, citing the city's coroner. The United Nations human rights office and activist groups like Amnesty and Human Rights Watch have called for a probe into Gadhafi's death. The United States supports those investigation requests, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday. ""As Libyans move into the future once again, they need to do so with a sense of unity and reconciliation. They need to hold each other accountable. Those who do not have blood on their hands must be made to feel safe and included, regardless of whether or not they supported Gadhafi in the past,"" she said. ""So we believe in the rule of law, and accountability, and such an investigation would contribute to that."" U.N. human rights spokesman Rupert Colville told reporters in Geneva on Friday that there were ""at least two cell-phone videos, one showing (Gadhafi) alive and one showing him dead."" ""Taken together, these videos are very disturbing,"" he said. ""We believe there is a need for an investigation and more details are needed to ascertain whether he was killed in the fighting or after his capture.","NEW: Gadhafi's son Saadi is ""outraged"" over circumstances surrounding his death .

"Cambridge, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Throughout President Barack Obama's political career, he has been dogged by insinuations or, indeed, accusations that he is not ""black enough"" to warrant strong support from African-Americans. Rep. Bobby Rush made that assertion when he successfully fended off Obama's effort to wrest from him his seat in the House of Representatives in the Democratic primary in 2000. Alan Keyes voiced that sentiment in his losing campaign against Obama for the U.S. Senate. When Obama accepted the presidential nomination of the Democratic Party, the celebrity scholar Cornel West groused that the first African-American standard-bearer for a major party had ""run from history"" by failing to mention explicitly the ""black freedom movement."" Skepticism regarding Obama's racial bona fides has continued to surface since he moved into the White House. Rep. Maxine Waters, for instance, has recently chided him for failing to craft policies that would explicitly target black unemployment and for otherwise neglecting, in her view, to evince a proper acknowledgment of the baleful and disproportionate pain being experienced in black communities on account of the economic downturn. What is one to make of this critique? First, it should not be at all surprising. Black America is ideologically diverse, just like other communities. Moreover, as I document in ""Sellout: The Politics of Racial Betrayal,"" there exists in black America a special anxiety about the loyalties of high achievers, especially when their success is largely dependent on whites and others who are not black. Every prominent black in a predominantly white setting faces, at one time or another, claims from fellow blacks that he or she is ""selling out."" Second, Obama's black detractors receive a degree of attention in the news media that is far greater than their representativeness of black America or their influence within it. The great bulk of black American voters -- upward of 90% -- supported Obama in 2008 and do so today. They do so because of his party affiliation, his liberal policy preferences, his identification with the African-American community (the offspring of an interracial couple, he calls himself black and married a black woman), his personal attractiveness -- he is uncommonly articulate, handsome, knowledgeable and gracious -- and the fact that with all of the added burdens attendant to his blackness, he was still able to climb the Mount Everest of American politics. Unlike some of Obama's most vocal detractors, the black rank-and-file have a realistic appreciation of the limits of his authority and the power of the forces arrayed against him, including a large, albeit amorphous, strain of racial resentment. Pained by the economic recession, they refrain from blaming Obama and instead direct their ire at those who not only saddled the first black chief executive with such a harrowing task of cleanup but also obstruct him relentlessly and often with barely disguised contempt. Third, even though Obama's black detractors constitute currently only a small sliver of African-American public opinion, their critique is nonetheless important in practical, electoral terms. It is often the case that a vocal, motivated minority can exercise influence that far exceeds their numbers. Enthusiasm matters. A drumbeat of complaint calling into question Obama's attentiveness to blacks might well diminish the fervency of the support he will need for his re-election effort. Furthermore, certain actions he might take to respond to the racial critique might well alienate other, nonblack, potential supporters. The race line will ensnare Obama no matter how he proceeds. It will not necessarily defeat him. His epochal victory in 2008 showed that, unlike previous eras, our own is one in which a black politician can overcome racial barriers to win the highest office in the land. Still, the sobering reality is that race remains an important, persistent force in American life despite the presence of a black family in the White House. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Randall Kennedy.","Randall Kennedy: Some black voices have said Obama isn't ""black enough""

"(CNN) -- Cameroon's high rate of teenage pregnancy is being blamed for driving mothers to use harmful traditions on their daughters -- including the unspeakable practice of breast ironing. Some mothers ""iron"" their daughters' breasts with a hot pestle to make them less desirable to men. It's a practice that's meant to stop them getting pregnant at a young age, but it leaves many girls physically and emotionally scarred. A study in 2006 found nearly one in four Cameroonian girls have been affected. But a new generation of Cameroonian women are on a mission to eradicate the practice. Among them is Georgette Taku. She believes better sex education is the key to reducing teenage pregnancy and changing attitudes to breast ironing. ""What is killing the Cameroonian girl in society is that mothers don't communicate with their daughters, they don't talk,"" said Taku. Taku works for the Association of Aunties, a national network that promotes sexual dialogue. It was her own pregnancy and the birth of her son that pushed her into a life of activism. ""They (mothers) only resort to some actions, some practices to try to help the girl,"" said Taku. ""It's better to talk to your daughter -- that's why we teach the mothers even things like puberty."" ""The mothers are ignorant, they don't know how to approach their daughters,"" she added. With the help of sponsors, the association produces television and print campaigns urging Cameroonian girls to find their voice and confront their mothers. Malawi's 'Florence Nightingale' saving babies and mothers . Workshops are also held to educate women about reproductive health. The idea is that when they graduate they'll become trusted sources of information for other Cameroonian girls. One workshop participant, Terisia, became pregnant aged 15. Her mother ironed her breasts when she was just nine years old. Terisia believes she might not have become pregnant so young if her mother had talked to her about sex instead. ""The advice could have worked better than pressing the breasts,"" Terisia said. ""Sitting with the child, giving the child advice, telling her to prevent sexual intercourse, or if you want to have (sex) you should protect yourself."" But like other mothers, Terisia's mother Grace says she ironed her daughter's breasts to stop boys looking at her. ""If you ask mothers who are doing breast ironing on their daughters, they will tell you that, 'no I'm doing it because I want to help her, I want to protect her from men,'"" said Taku. Among those working for the Association of Aunties is a former victim of breast ironing who says she regrets not speaking out about what was happening to her. Cathy Aba now hopes to save other girls by confronting mothers about the effects of their actions. ""It's not easy to approach mothers who are involved in the practice of breast ironing,"" she said. ""They consider it a cultural practice. 'My grandmother did it to me,' they tell us."" The 23-year-old still has painful scars, 14 years after her breasts were ironed. Her doctor says surgery is no longer an option. ""When you finally pass the message to them, they finally accept and decide to never do it again,"" Aba added. The campaign group says former victims like Aba really drive home its message. ""Our victims help us a lot because they talk to mothers; they make the mothers understand that they suffered from this practice,"" Taku said. ""Even though they had the breasts ironed they grew up ignorant when it came to pregnancy, HIV and other sexual diseases because the mothers were not talking with them.""","Breast ironing widespread in Cameroon, says study .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- India is in the fast lane. The trillion-plus-dollar economy, Asia's largest after Japan and China, is set to host the world's fastest sport this weekend. The subcontinent's inaugural Grand Prix comes barely a year after India earned international scorn for all the chaos and corruption allegations that plagued the 2010 Commonwealth Games staged in New Delhi. That event was marred by a host of problems including athletes' alarm over the shoddy construction and condition of their quarters, while a pedestrian bridge leading to the main Jawarhalal Nehru Stadium collapsed two days before the competitors were due to arrive. In April this year, India's federal police arrested the Games' chief organizer, Suresh Kalmadi, for suspected corruption. Kalmadi, who was involved in bringing F1 to India through his former role at the Indian Olympic Association, was jailed for allegedly buying a time, scoring and result system from a Swiss company at inflated costs. He was also suspended by the political party with which he was an MP. But promoters of India's first F1 race hope their $400 million project will repair the damage done to the country's reputation. ""The world's perception of India is going to change after the Grand Prix and people will forget what happened because of the Commonwealth Games,"" said Jaiprakash Gaur, founding chairman of Jaypee Group that built the Buddh International Circuit. A few weeks ago, a fleet of Mercedes-Benz cars whizzed media crews around the 5.125-kilometer circuit, giving them a glimpse of what Indian businesses lauded as a stirring example of their competence. ""Corporate India is completely capable, and they are capable of executing projects of world class, which has been demonstrated by the F1 track, which looks certainly as one of the best in the world,"" said Ajay Sharma, a senior director with the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India. ""This is great news for the country because the investors are also now excited that this is the country where, you know, all the happening things are happening,"" he told CNN. Sharma's lobby group predicts that investments in the motorsport infrastructure could potentially fuel overall economic prosperity by some $10 billion over the next decade. It says the arrival of global sporting bodies -- themselves seeking a foothold in emerging markets -- is an ideal opportunity for international brand-building by Indian businesses. However, not everyone is as excited about the event when so many Indians live in abject poverty. ""The contrast between the rich and the poor is very large in India,"" said Arun Kumar, a professor at the Center of Economic Studies and Planning at New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University. ""Here, about 40% of our people live in extreme poverty without even basic facilities. In a sense, it sounds very cruel that the nation is spending a large amount of its wealth on such sports."" The track complex, complete with stands and team enclosures painted in the colors of India's flag, was built by private developers on land acquired from farmers, who later alleged they were short-changed for their properties. Last week, the country's Supreme Court froze 25% of ticket revenue after a litigant challenged government tax waivers on the race. Critics are questioning the taste of putting up such high-octane shows in a country where a quarter of its billion-plus people still lives on less than a dollar a day. With organizers struggling to sell out the event, ticket prices for Sunday's race have already been slashed. The most expensive has dropped from $715 to about $300, and the cheapest from about $120 to $60. But even the lowest amount is equivalent to the monthly wages of tens of thousands of Indians. ""What do we consider to be a nation? A nation means having a concern for all citizens. In this day and age when advertising has become so large, expectations have risen and these lavish displays only increase discontent,"" Kumar said.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Tensions among Pakistan, Afghanistan and the United States jumped a notch Monday, with Pakistan's prime minister warning there would be ""no more business as usual"" with Washington after NATO aircraft killed two dozen Pakistan troops. Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani told CNN in an exclusive interview that Pakistan is re-evaluating its relationship with the United States in light of the airstrike, which NATO called a ""tragic unintended"" event. He said the South Asian nation wants to maintain its relationship with the United States so long as there is mutual respect and respect for Pakistani sovereignty. Asked directly if Pakistan is getting that respect, Gilani said: ""At the moment not."" ""If I can't protect the sovereignty of my country, how can we say that this is mutual respect and mutual interest?"" he asked. The Pakistani Taliban urged Pakistan to respond in kind to the airstrike, while a top adviser to Afghan President Hamid Karzai warned that Afghanistan and Pakistan could be on a path to conflict. In his CNN interview, Gilani highlighted incidents such as the killing of the Pakistani troops and a U.S. raid into Pakistan to kill Osama bin Laden as violations of his country's sovereignty. ""You cannot win any war without the support of the masses ... and such sort of incidents makes people move away from this situation,"" he said. Pakistan is a vital land supply route into Afghanistan for the United States and its allies, and a key partner in the battle against al Qaeda and its aligned jihadist movements. But Pakistani authorities turned back 300 trucks carrying NATO supplies and fuel into Afghanistan on Monday, and the prime minister said his government had not yet decided whether to boycott an upcoming Bonn conference on the future of Afghanistan. Details of Saturday's deadly raid remained unclear Monday, and the chief of U.S. forces in the region named an Air Force general from the military's Special Operations Command to lead an investigation. Gen. James Mattis ordered the investigating officer, Brig. Gen. Stephen Clark, to report back to him by December 23. According to two senior U.S. officials with direct knowledge of initial reporting on the incident, the probe is focusing on what coordination failures occurred before the airstrike. One of the officials said initial reports indicate U.S. and Afghan forces said shots were fired across the border from Pakistan, noting that it is a known tactic of insurgents to fire into Afghanistan from very close to Pakistan border checkpoints because they believe it will give them sanctuary. The United States believes the Pakistanis ""were called"" before NATO opened fire, the official said, but he added that ""at this point, we just don't know exactly what coordination was done."" A NATO official said Afghan troops were working with elements of U.S. Special Operations forces in a combined mission on the Afghan side of the border. Pakistani military spokesman Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas denied the reports that Pakistani troops had prompted the attack Saturday by firing on the NATO helicopters. Speaking by phone to Pakistan's Geo TV News, Abbas said NATO helicopters fired first on the Pakistani military checkpoints. Abbas said the soldiers notified Pakistani military headquarters, which informed NATO authorities immediately. The spokesman said Pakistani soldiers fired at the NATO aircraft in retaliation. Speaking in London, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, acknowledged that the U.S.-Pakistani relationship was ""troubled."" But he suggested it would survive once the two nations work through the ""real tragedy"" of the Pakistani deaths. ""We've had other moments before,"" Dempsey said. ""I'm hopeful that with the relationships we've built leader-to-leader and worked at over the past years, that we can find our way forward. But I understand the anger. I understand the concern."" The White House offered its condolences to Pakistan, while State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Washington was concerned about the impact the incident could have on relations with Pakistan. ""The relationship is vitally important to both countries. We both face a shared threat from extremists. ... We're taking this very seriously,"" he said. A U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity told CNN that Pakistan remains a ""critical"" partner in counterterrorism, ""and we do not anticipate significant changes in that relationship."" The Pakistani Taliban appeared to try to widen the rift Monday. A spokesman for the fundamentalist Islamic movement, Ihsanullah Ihsan, said in a phone call to CNN that the U.S. will infringe on Pakistan's sovereignty and continue operations on Pakistani soil in the coming days. Ihsan said Pakistan must respond in kind to the NATO attacks, and he warned that the Pakistani Taliban will continue jihad as long as Pakistan remains an ally of the United States. In Kabul, meanwhile, a senior adviser to President Karzai said Afghanistan and Pakistan may be on a course toward military conflict. Ashraf Ghani said the link between Pakistan and the assassination of a former Afghan president had united his country ""against interference."" Ghani accused Pakistan of harboring and assisting the insurgency in Afghanistan, and said his country's neighbor probably helped the suicide bomber who killed former Afghan President Burhanudin Rabbani in September. ""The assassination of President Rabbani has gelled the nation together against interference. And one or two more actions could put us in an irreversible course (toward) conflict. And we've shown through our history that we are a match for any invader,"" he said. The two nations have been trading accusations in the border regions in the past few months, with Pakistan accusing the Afghans of harboring militants and Afghanistan claiming Pakistani shells have hit Afghan territory. But on Sunday, a spokesman for Karzai urged Pakistan to come to the Bonn conference, which is being billed as a chance to start a reconciliation process in Afghanistan. ""We want Pakistan to participate in that. We want Pakistan to be part of the solution in Afghanistan,"" Aimal Faizi said. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh reported from Kabul, Afghanistan.

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- High tide on Friday sent some water pouring into the Bangkok's Chinatown area, but it receded within a few hours, while the commercial district remained largely dry. Those who have stayed in the city despite the government's pleas to leave are waiting to see if the highest tide, forecast to come Saturday afternoon, will overwhelm defenses along the city's river and many canals and bring more damaging floods. Floodwaters that drenched much of central and lower parts of northern Thailand crept Thursday into Bangkok, stressing embankments and flooding roads, parking lots, factories and markets and sending many residents fleeing for dry ground. Up to 1 meter (3.2 feet) of water was expected in some areas, said Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, as the Chao Phraya River spilled into the city of 12 million people. Several districts were under a mandatory evacuation order. ""There is water from underground coming up,"" said Pracha Promnok, chief of the Flood Relief Operations Center. ""We are unable to do anything (to stop it)."" Yingluck fielded criticism that the flood relief center had not done enough and -- with tears in her eyes -- called on the public to sympathize with emergency staff, as some of them had also become victims of the flooding. ""Many are exhausted and some problems cannot be controlled and were not caused by (the center),"" Yingluck said, according to MCOT. Thailand's government declared public holidays through the rest of the month in 21 flood-affected provinces, and appealed to Bangkok residents to head to the countryside. People flocked to bus terminals and crowded the Suvarnabhumi Airport, the main airport, in hopes of reaching higher ground. The smaller domestic airport, its runways inundated, was closed until November 1, but Suvarnabhumi was operating normally, protected by 3.5 meters (almost 12 feet) of dikes, said Toopetch Booyarith of the Airport Authority of Thailand. ""We are confident that we will not be affected,"" Toopetch said. CNNGo: Updated info for tourists . The streets of the normally bustling metropolis that is notorious for massive traffic jams stood empty Thursday, save for a few public buses and taxis that were able to navigate through. There was even water standing before the Grand Palace, perhaps the most adored of Bangkok's landmarks. In some neighborhoods vacated by people, domestic animals were left to fend for themselves. ""You'll see dogs stranded on rooftops, dogs trying to swim,"" said Marcelo Cacciola, of the Soi Dog Foundation. ""So we went to these little towns around the Bangkok area with boats and rescued the dogs."" Some hotels slashed prices to accommodate the flood-affected and some tourist areas reported full occupancies. In the resort town of Pattaya, fleeing Bangkok residents found it hard to get a room in hotels overflowing with European tourists, the Bangkok Post reported. Thanyarat Hemkittiwat said she was planning to leave Bangkok to stay with relatives outside the city. ""Some families in southern Bangkok had their house flooded,"" said the 31-year-old worker at a furniture export company, which was shut after it, too, was flooded. ""The water level is two meters (six feet) high and smells very bad,"" she said. She said the military had set up a flood relief center, ""but now even that has water coming in it."" UNICEF said it was providing $300,000 in aid that includes 20,000 insecticide-treated mosquito nets. The U.S. State Department issued a travel alert recommending against all but essential travel to affected areas. It noted that most tourist destinations, such as Phuket and Chiang Mai, were unaffected. U.S. Ambassador Kristie Kenny said the crisis was slow-moving and it was hard to know what would be hit next. The United States has already provided civilian relief resources, including water pumps, water purifiers and life vests, she said, and two U.S. helicopters are helping the Thai military determine the extent of the flooding. The floods, caused by monsoon rains that saturated rivers, have killed 373 people nationwide and affected more than 9.5 million people, authorities said. Are you there? Share photos, video but stay safe . The government has called the flooding the worst to afflict the nation in half a century and said it might take more than a month before the waters recede from some areas. The government has set up more than 1,700 shelters nationwide, and more than 113,000 people have taken refuge in them. Overall damage from the floods could exceed $6 billion, the Thai Finance Ministry said. CNN's Sara Sidner, Aliza Kassim and Elizabeth Yuan contributed to this report.

"Casablanca, Morocco (CNN) -- A moderate Islamist party appears to be heading toward victory as votes are counted in Morocco's first parliamentary elections since constitutional reforms in the summer. The Justice and Development Party (PJD) won at least 80 seats, Interior Minister Taib Cherkaoui said Saturday, with at least 288 seats out of 395 counted. The party's secretary general Abdelilah Benkirane said the party had won more than 100 seats. Even the lower figure of 80 would give the PJD more seats than any other party, according to the Moroccan government's website. The next biggest winner was the Independence Party, with 45 seats, that website reported. The number of parties involved in Morocco's multi-party system means no single party is likely to win a majority of the seats, so a coalition government would have to be formed. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton offered her congratulations Saturday ""on the successful completion"" of the elections. ""The United States stands ready to work with the new parliament and the people of Morocco to strengthen the rule of law, raise human rights standards, promote transparent and accountable governance, and work toward sustained, democratic reform,"" she said. Turnout in the North African country was 45%, the Interior Ministry said Friday. The National Democratic Institute -- which had 41 accredited observers from 21 countries that went to over 200 polling stations on Friday -- said in a press release that the elections ""were conducted transparently."" The voting process was described as ""technically sound"" and ""without fear of tampering or procedural violations."" But one institute member, Canadian Liberal Party leader Bob Rae, also pointed to the turnout and a number of invalid and spoiled ballots as negatives. ""Seeing the number of people who actively spoiled their ballots as well as those who did not participate, it is clear that the path to real change will take more effort and time,"" Rae said. Lise Storm, senior lecturer in Middle East Politics at the University of Exeter in England, said Friday that the outcome might signal whether the population is happy with the monarchy or not. The more votes for the PJD appear to indicate a desire for greater change, she said -- as opposed to votes for the bloc of traditional loyalist parties, which would suggest voters favor the status quo. Under the new constitution, approved by referendum in July, both Parliament and the prime minister have greater powers, while the monarch's sway has been slightly lessened. The changes mean the prime minister must now be chosen from the party that wins the greatest number of votes -- which, based on the preliminary results, would be the Justice and Development Party -- rather than King Mohammed VI selecting his own nominee for the job. The reforms came after thousands of Moroccans took to the streets to demonstrate earlier this year, inspired by what became known as the Arab Spring. The youth-based February 20 Movement called for jobs and an end to corruption its members say stems from royal cronies. Analysts say economic reform is needed to create more jobs for the country's young people, particularly many university graduates who are unemployed. Journalist Aida Alami contributed to this report.","NEW: The Islamist Justice and Development Party wins more votes than any other party .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A brawl between motorcycle club members at a western Nevada casino devolved into a gunfight that left one person dead and two wounded, police said Saturday. Around 11:25 p.m. Friday, a fight broke out among members of the Hell's Angels and Vagos clubs in front of the Trader Dick's bar inside John Ascuaga's Nugget, a family-owned casino in Sparks, that city's deputy police chief Brian Allen told reporters. Police in Sparks, which is just east of Reno, responded with assistance from overhead helicopters after hearing several people involved in the brawl had guns and that shots were fired. Authorities earlier reported that as many as 30 people total took part in the altercation. They came upon what Sparks police Lt. Pete Krall described earlier Saturday as a ""very chaotic scene."" That included ""multiple gunshot victims"" who were transported to area hospitals, according to Allen. One Hell's Angels member died from his wounds, while two associated with Vagos suffered what the deputy chief described as ""non-life-threatening"" injuries. No bystanders or casino employees were wounded in the incident, he added. The incident, as well a ""subsequent drive-by shooting"" elsewhere in the city, prompted the declaration of a ""state of emergency"" in Sparks, the city announced late Saturday afternoon on its website. ""Whenever you have people who enter our city with bad intentions, bad things are going to happen,"" Sparks Mayor Geno Martini said during a press conference Saturday. ""That's what happened here last night."" Sparks police have arrested ""one Hell's Angels member for his involvement in the fight and subsequent shooting,"" Allen said. ""Other law enforcement agencies made additional arrests on the outskirts of the incident, and we are coordinating to determine their ... involvement in the case."" Renown Medical Center, located in Reno, announced on its website at 1:45 p.m. Saturday that it had ""applied extra security measures and locked all exterior access to the hospital, except for (one) emergency room entrance"" because of the shooting. By 3 p.m., the hospital said it would be ""easing precautionary security measures for various entrances/exits,"" though there would be ""limited access"" for certain areas. The incident erupted in the midst of the Street Vibrations Fall Rally, an event that began Wednesday and is set to continue into Sunday in Reno. Allen said that since the 18th annual event recently expanded into Sparks, there have been no incidents such as the one Friday night. He did state that, after the shooting, Reno, Sparks and Washoe County authorities are ""increasing personnel at the event."" The event's activities in Sparks were canceled through the weekend because of the shooting, the city announced Saturday afternoon. Still, hours earlier, its mayor said the incident -- while worrisome -- shouldn't cast a negative light on all motorcycle club members. ""I hope the people out there won't judge the motorcycle community by the incident that happened last night,"" said Martini. ""I don't think it's a true picture."" CNN's Michael Martinez, Maggie Schneider and Divina Mims contributed to this report.","Gunfire breaks out in a fight between Hell's Angels and Vagos motorcycle club members .

"(CNN) -- Andrew Niccol's ""In Time"" is the winner of this year's ""Most Obvious and Pun-Filled Allegory"" competition and while it gets points for an excellent premise, some fine acting and for being, occasionally, genuinely exciting, the execution of the idea fails far more often than it succeeds. ""In Time"" is set in some future time/alternate reality Los Angeles (the locations are referred to as Dayton and New Greenwich but it's all too obviously L.A.) where humans cease aging at 25 with only an additional one year on their internal clocks, displayed as a sub-dermal, glowing digital countdown on their forearms. Everyone in the film is young and (mostly) beautiful and aside from running out of time, people can only die by acts of violence, random or otherwise -- disease is apparently nonexistent. But more time can be earned (or stolen) so those who are wealthy live, while those who are poor die. As a result, the poor take risks because they have nothing to lose, while the rich play it very safe, some refusing to take even minuscule physical risks like swimming in the ocean. The poor, those short on time, live in Dayton (downtown L.A., near the river) and if they have jobs at all, they live literally day-to-day, hoping that they can get enough work to purchase another day on their clocks. Those without jobs resort to begging or ""fighting,"" a sort of arm-wrestling for time. Many work in a factory that makes time storage devices that can be used to move time around from place to place or person to person, like a wallet with money in it. As with most films set in a poor neighborhood, the denizens of Dayton have dreams. In general, to have enough time so that they can live a decent life without having to wake up every day thinking it's their last. They are literally slaves to time, forced to either beg, steal or work at sub-standard wages simply in order to live. While this set-up should give ample opportunity for visual and emotional shock, Dayton is spectacularly clean and well organized for what's essentially a factory slum. The only indication that the locals are in any peril at all is the (very) occasional shot of a dead ""timed out"" body on the street. You'd think it would happen more often. Justin Timberlake plays Will Salas, a factory worker whose personal dream is to be able to celebrate his mother's birthday in the rich playground of New Greenwich (which looks very much like Century City and Malibu) and early on, it looks like he might have achieved that dream when he suddenly finds himself with over a century of time. In a local bar, Salas rescues Henry Hamilton, a suspiciously well-dressed stranger (""White Collar"" star Matt Bomer) from a group of time thieves called Minute Men, who ""clean the clocks"" of their victims. However, it turns out that the rescued man was trying to die. He's 105 and has simply grown tired of living. Having been thwarted in his initial attempt at suicide, Hamilton gives Will all but a few minutes of his life while the latter man is asleep, leaving him the message ""don't waste my time,"" hoping that Will will do something worthy with his new found riches. Lo and behold, before Will is able to enjoy his windfall a personal tragedy sets him on his path towards addressing the injustices of the world, by single-handedly (at first) destroying the ""monetary"" system. If it were only that easy, eh? After arriving in New Greenwich, he quickly attracts the attention of not only one of the richest men around (Philippe Weis, played by a perfectly smug Vincent Kartheiser) but also that of his daughter, Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried). Coming from the ""wrong side of the tracks,"" Will proves to be an oddity among the swells, as he knows how to live and take risks, like swimming in the ocean or driving a car really fast on the empty Pacific Coast Highway. While the setting of the film is ostensibly in the future, everyone is driving vintage Lincolns and Jaguars (although they do have the whine of electric vehicles) and people use pay phones. While of course it's perfectly OK for a future vision to have seemingly anachronistic touches, these play like prosaic failures of imagination. If you're going to ground a science fiction story in such mundane realities, at least give a reason why. Timberlake continues to prove that his prolonged hiatus from music is a well thought out decision. For all the success his recording career brought him, it's entirely possible that he has a brighter career as an actor. He is as capable here at action adventure as he was at broad comedy in ""Friends With Benefits."" I could easily see him in a musical or a straight drama. Seyfried, her doe-eyes framed with a cute bob a la Anna Karina or even more apropos, Faye Dunaway in ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" does her level best with what she's given, but her ""rich girl with a rebellious streak"" isn't as well-developed a character as it could be.It's never really clear if Sylvia's transition from slightly rebellious rich girl to full-on criminal is due to her belief in Salas' Robin Hood-esque cause or to her having the hots for him. I suspect it's both, but the former aspect isn't really fleshed out. The real crime here is that there is a potentially great movie in the premise. The concept of a brutally fascist world were time is literally money and where the poor are haunted and driven by the specter of impending death is an intriguing one. Alas, Niccol's screenplay doesn't quite nail it, giving us a flat, uncomplicated story, some rather herky-jerky character development and an endless stream of absurd plot points. Yes, there are some legitimately suspenseful moments, but not enough to make up for the rest. There is a lot of dramatic fodder in the story of a future as horrific as this one and ""In Time"" doesn't really take advantage of the opportunities. It's not nearly as menacing or terrifying as its premise suggests and it doesn't say much, except in the simplest It's-bad-when-rich-people-hoard-resources fashion. I'm curious as to what a filmmaker like Sidney Lumet, Alan J. Pakula or William Friedkin would have done with as rich of a set-up. The fact that ""In Time"" could have been an exceptional film is the most upsetting part. I would rather it have been a truly bad film than a mediocre film with the specter of greatness hovering just out of reach. ""In Time"" is rated PG-13. There's a fair amount of gun violence, death, the occasional four-letter word (and their various variants) an underwater bare bottom, and some clothed sexual suggestions.","Justin Timberlake plays Will Salas, a factory worker in a race against time .

"(CNN) -- More than 150 students at the University of California at Berkeley took over a campus building Thursday to protest a proposed 81% increase in tuition fees, university officials said. UC-Berkeley spokeswoman Callie Maidhof described the scene as ""an open occupation with people coming and going"" at Tolman Hall on the campus that has been known for decades as a hotbed of student activism and protests. The tuition increase proposed by the board of regents would be phased in over a four-year period. Maidhof added that when the protest began Thursday afternoon, campus police initially resisted the demonstrators and used pepper spray at one point. The university maintained a hands-off approach after that, but according to Maidhof the situation could change at the building's scheduled closing time of 9 p.m. (midnight ET). As evening fell, there were between 60 and 70 students occupying one of the classrooms and another group was participating in a teach-in outside on the lawn. Helicopter aerials of the scene from CNN affiliate KTVU showed a few protest banners hung from windows of the classroom building.","The university board of regents has proposed an 81% tuition hike over four years .

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- Marco Rubio is writing his life story. Now the only question is: Which life? The 40-year-old Florida senator, and Republican Party rock star, is shopping his memoir to New York publishing houses. There is sure to be a market; Republicans want to embrace a Latino conservative to shield them from accusations that their immigration rhetoric is anti-Latino, and so, for them, Rubio is the most beloved Latino since Desi Arnaz. A memoir is a good idea. Rubio may need a whole book to explain the contradictions surrounding his biography. Rubio has repeatedly said that his parents left Cuba after Fidel Castro took power in January 1959. But documents brought to light by the Washington Post and St. Petersburg Times reveal that Mario and Oriales Rubio arrived in the United States, legally on an immigration visa, much earlier -- in May 1956. So what? That's the scandal? Rubio is clearly not the only American with a bad memory. Many European-Americans are so far removed from their families' immigrant past that, not only can they not tell you when their ancestors migrated to the United States, sometimes they can barely tell you what country their family came from. ""Let's see, I'm part German, and I think I have a little Irish and some Italian. No, some French."" Apparently, if you're Cuban-American, it matters a lot. There is a pecking order in South Florida. Being a descendant of those who came as political exiles after Castro came to power supposedly carries more cachet than if your family simply came as economic immigrants before Castro took power. I don't get it. But then, I'm not Cuban-American. So I defer to two friends (and media colleagues) who are. Alfredo Estrada, publisher of Latino Magazine, is skeptical about Rubio getting the dates wrong. ""When your parents left Cuba is seared into the memory of every Cuban-American,"" he told me. Rick Sanchez, whose family left Cuba in the winter of 1962, was much harder on Rubio. In an op-ed for The Huffington Post, the former CNN host blasted the inconsistency and tied it back to the senator's immigration views. ""[Rubio] convinced Americans that he was the son of political refugees,"" Sanchez wrote, ""implying that it somehow made him different from the other Hispanics who he attacks regularly -- the ones in Arizona, Georgia and Alabama that he and others want to detain, arrest and kick out. How dare they come here looking for work and to better their lot in life? Marco Rubio made us believe he is different from them when he's not."" I understand what my friends are saying. And I understand that, as a Mexican-American and not a Cuban-American, there are some things I will never understand. Nevertheless, I thought that Rubio did a fine job of acquitting himself in an op-ed for Politico. ""The Washington Post accused me of seeking political advantage by embellishing the story of how my parents arrived in the United States,"" he wrote. ""That is an outrageous allegation that is not only incorrect, but an insult to the sacrifices my parents made to provide a better life for their children...I am the son of immigrants and exiles, raised by people who know all too well that you can lose your country. By people who know firsthand that America is a very special place...Ultimately what The Post writes is not that important to me. I am the son of exiles. I inherited two generations of unfulfilled dreams. This is a story that needs no embellishing."" That's poetry, and yet that op-ed may have backfired. National Public Radio says that it has found discrepancies between what Rubio wrote for Politico and the account that Rubio offered on one of its shows two years ago. For Politico, Rubio wrote, ""In February 1961, my mother took my older siblings to Cuba with the intention of moving back... But after just a few weeks, it became clear that the change happening in Cuba was not for the better...So in late March 1961...my mother and siblings left Cuba and my family settled permanently in the United States."" But, in 2009, Rubio told NPR's ""All Things Considered"" that his mother returned to Cuba in 1960 with his older siblings to care for her ailing father and that she wound up staying nine months because the Cuban government wouldn't let her and her eldest son, Mario, return to the United States. Eventually, she and her children were allowed to leave. Which is it? Did Rubio's mother return to Cuba in 1960 or 1961? Was she preparing to move back, or caring for a sick parent? And did she stay ""just a few weeks"" or nine months? Documents confirm that Oriales Rubio was in Cuba for just over one month. So the story that Rubio wrote in Politico was closer to the truth than the one he shared with NPR. Frankly, I don't know what to make of this story. My reporter's nose tells me there are more ""gotcha"" revelations to come. My head tells me that this whole story doesn't matter to most Americans. And my heart tells me that Rubio would not even be in hot water -- especially with fellow Latinos -- if he was not a Republican. Rubio is someone with a shot at becoming the first Latino in the White House, he terrifies the Democratic establishment. And so they want to take him out. Yet, I am quite impressed that the story of one family's exodus from Cuba more than 60 years ago has captured the attention of so many of my media colleagues. Now if I could just get them to focus on a much more important story to which many of them are turning a blind eye: the exodus of more than one million illegal immigrants from the United States, and the breaking up of hundreds of thousands of families, at the hands of the Obama administration. All of it for the sake of politics. Now that's what I call a scandal. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Ruben Navarrette: GOP ""rock star"" Marco Rubio has warring details in his life story .

"(CNN) -- Former college and pro football star Charles Aaron ""Bubba"" Smith, who went on to an acting career after his retirement from sports, was found dead at his home, the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office said Wednesday. He was 66. Police and fire officials were called to Smith's home after ""he was found unresponsive"" and pronounced him dead, said Ed Winter, assistant chief of operations and investigation for the coroner. An autopsy will be performed to determine cause of death, Winter said. However, asked if there was any reason to believe the death was due to anything other than natural causes, he replied, ""Not at this time."" An imposing 6 foot 8 and 260 pounds, Smith was considered one of the most fearsome pass rushers of his day. The No. 1 overall pick in the 1967 National Football League draft, he played nine seasons in the NFL -- for the Baltimore Colts, Oakland Raiders and Houston Oilers. Sports Illustrated gallery: The NFL goes Hollywood . He played for the Colts in two Super Bowls and was also a two-time Pro Bowl pick. Smith was one of the anchors of an overwhelming defense that was heavily favored to win Super Bowl III. Nonetheless, the New York Jets, led by Joe Namath, defeated the Colts in the 1969 championship of pro football, widely considered one of the biggest upsets in U.S. sports history. The Colts atoned for that embarrassment -- somewhat -- two years later in a 16-13 victory over the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl V, but Smith reportedly said he was so dismayed by the game's sloppiness that he never wore his Super Bowl ring. Smith was sidelined by a severe knee injury during an exhibition game in 1972, and the next season joined the Raiders. He told Sports Illustrated in 1973 that ""not playing was terrible. I didn't want to show my face in public. I don't know if it was that we were losing or what, but it almost drove me crazy."" After retiring from pro football in 1975, Smith landed small roles on TV series such as ""Good Times,"" ""Charlie's Angels"" and ""Semi-Tough,"" according to IMDb, before landing his signature role as Lt. Moses Hightower in the first ""Police Academy"" movie in 1984. He reprised the role in all six movies in the popular comedy franchise. Smith was a two-time All-America defensive end at Michigan State University. He played in what the national media dubbed ""the game of the century"" between Michigan State and Notre Dame in 1966, a 10-10 tie that resulted in the two teams' splitting the vote for that year's national championship. Smith was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1988, an event he called ""the jewel in my crown, for my collegiate days were very special to me."" Smith was born on February 28, 1945, in Beaumont Texas. His father was a high school football coach and his mother had earned two college degrees. According to his member biography on the College Football Hall of Fame website, he said he took his parents with him when he went to speak to youth groups ""to demonstrate my respect for them.""","Charles Aaron ""Bubba"" Smith, 66, was found dead in his L.A. home .

"Perugia, Italy (CNN) -- The lawyer for Meredith Kercher's family showed photos of the British murder victim's bloodied body Monday, pointing out multiple stab wounds, as he urged an Italian jury not to overturn the murder convictions of Amanda Knox and Rafaelle Sollecito. ""I show you these pictures to show you the pain of Meredith,"" Francesco Maresca said. ""She didn't have defensive wounds. It means that she was tied up, that she had more than one aggressor,"" the lawyer said. ""Given the type, number and locations of the wounds, there had to be multiple attackers,"" he insisted. He attacked as ""useless"" a review of DNA evidence that may cast doubt on the original convictions. American student Knox and her former boyfriend Sollecito were convicted of the killing in 2009 and are now fighting to have the verdicts overturned. Knox was sentenced to 26 years in prison, while Sollecito got 25. A third man, Rudy Guede, was convicted separately and is serving 16 years. Knox and Sollecito's defense teams have suggested he could have been the sole killer. Lawyers for the civil suits related to the case presented their closing arguments Monday. Knox avoided looking at the photographs of Kercher's body as they were shown. Another lawyer called Knox two-faced and ""diabolical."" ""Within her lives a double soul: one which is angelic, good, compassionate ... tender and ingenuous,"" Carlo Pacelli said. But she had another side, he said: ""And a Lucifer-like, demonic, satanic, diabolical one which sometimes leads her to borderline and dissolute behavior,"" saying that was the Knox who had killed her roommate. Pacelli sought to portray Knox as sexually promiscuous and a difficult roommate as he fights for damages for Patrick Lumumba. His closing arguments were based on earlier testimony by friends of Kercher's. Curt Knox, Amanda Knox's father, said the language used by the lawyer ""was extraordinarily hard to listen to."" ""What I find very hard to believe is how this person can start calling her that when he's never even talked to her, never met her,"" Curt Knox told CNN's Brooke Baldwin on Monday night. Knox accused Lumumba of the murder in 2007. He was arrested but released after his alibi checked out. He later sued Knox for libel, winning 40,000 euros ($54,000) in damages. Knox's accusation of Lumumba shows that she committed the crime, Pacelli argued. ""Knox told lies,"" he said, adding that she was guilty and her conviction should stand. He urged the court not to ""fall under the spell of the defendant"" but to ""stick to the proof."" Knox testified in the initial trial that comments she made to police the night of the killing were the result of stress, mistreatment by police and inadequate translation help. Lawyers are making closing arguments this week, and a verdict could come as soon as October 3. Curt Knox said the defense will begin presenting its final arguments Tuesday, ""and I think we're going to see a very different picture of what this case is all about, and so will the world."" ""What we saw and what we heard in the first three hearings is really all circumstantial evidence,"" Curt Knox said. ""When it really comes down to the nuts and bolts of this case, you're going to hear in the next couple of days there really is no forensic case."" Knox was in court Monday, wearing an off-white top and black hooded sweater as the months-long process nears its conclusion. Curt Knox said his daughter has had trouble sleeping and has lost weight in recent weeks. ""These two judges and six jurors really have her life in their hands, and these last three hearings have been extraordinarily hard,"" he said. Sollecito was also present at Monday's hearing, with his hair cut short. He wore a long-sleeved shirt with a geometric pattern. The defense has sought to discredit DNA evidence linking the two of them to the killing, in which Kercher's throat was slashed. Her semi-clothed body was found in the house they shared in Perugia, a picturesque central Italian university town. An Italian prosecutor put forward a vigorous defense in closing arguments Saturday of the DNA evidence used to find her guilty. Prosecutor Manuela Comodi rejected testimony from independent forensics experts that cast doubt on the reliability of the evidence, insisting police forensic officers had handled the DNA material properly. And she urged the court to increase Knox and Sollecito's sentences to life. Comodi's appearance came on the second day of closing arguments for prosecutors in the appeal. On Saturday, she told jurors that the original court had concluded ""beyond any reasonable doubt"" that blood from both Knox and Kercher found in the bathroom sink had been left there when Knox washed herself after the killing. The prosecutor also pointed to a partial footprint with Kercher's blood found on a bathroom mat, saying analysis had shown that it was most likely to have been left by Sollecito. He and Knox say they were at Sollecito's house on the night Kercher died, not the villa the two girls shared. But Maresca disputed that Monday, calling their claim the ""false alibi."" Under Italian law, he said, in a trial based on circumstantial evidence, a defendant's alibi that turns out to be false can be used against them. The computer from Sollecito's house showed no activity on the night in question, he said, suggesting that he and Knox were not there. Defense attorneys for Sollecito are expected to present their final arguments Tuesday, to be followed by Knox's attorneys Thursday. Knox will be allowed to address the court one more time before the jury begins its deliberations, an opportunity her father says she has been thinking about the past three months. ""This is really her final opportunity to express her heartfelt thoughts as it relates to how she's being judged and the fact that she had nothing to do with this horrific crime and that Meredith was her friend,"" Curt Knox said. Knox and Sollecito are appealing their convictions together, having been convicted in a joint trial. CNN's Hada Messia contributed to this report.","A lawyer calls Amanda Knox two-faced, with a ""diabolical"" side .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Britain condemned Iran for allowing protesters to storm its embassy and a separate diplomatic compound in Tehran on Tuesday, warning there will be ""serious consequences"" as a result. The incursion happened after about 1,000 people gathered near the embassy to demand that the British ambassador be sent home immediately. The rally began quietly, but some participants then stormed the building, breaking down the door, throwing around papers and replacing the British flag with an Iranian one. A CNN producer saw protesters -- identified as students in state news outlets -- throwing stones at the embassy's windows. They scuffled with and overwhelmed police at the embassy gate and around the compound. British Prime Minister David Cameron described the incursion as ""outrageous and indefensible"" and demanded that Iran immediately ensure the safety of all British Embassy personnel. Iranian security forces are responsible for guarding the embassy under international law, he said. ""The failure of the Iranian government to defend British staff and property was a disgrace,"" he said. He called on Iran's government to guarantee the safety of embassy staff, return property seized in the fracas and prosecute those responsible. ""The Iranian government must recognize that there will be serious consequences for failing to protect our staff,"" Cameron said. ""We will consider what these measures should be in the coming days."" By Tuesday evening, the protesters had been cleared from both sites by police, the semi-official Fars news agency reported. Police arrested 12 students as they left the diplomatic compound, called Gholhak Garden, the news agency said. British diplomats and their families and Iranian families who work for the British Embassy live at Gholak Garden, in northern Tehran. Foreign Secretary William Hague said the ""irresponsible action"" had put the safety of diplomats and their families at risk and caused extensive damage to embassy property. He had spoken to his Iranian counterpart, Ali Akbar Salehi, Tuesday to ""protest in the strongest terms,"" he said. ""While he said that he was sorry for what had happened and that action would be taken in response, this remains a very serious failure by the Iranian government,"" Hague said. ""Clearly there will be other, further, and serious consequences."" Hague will address the British Parliament Wednesday, he said. Iran's Foreign Ministry expressed its regret for the student protest, ""which turned into an out of control demonstration,"" in a statement on its website. The ministry said it would ""take action through legal channels"" against those who stormed the embassy building. The Foreign Office said it had asked the Iranian charge d'affaires in London ""to urge the Iranian authorities to act with utmost urgency to ensure the situation is brought under control."" It is now advising British nationals in Iran ""to stay indoors, keep a low profile and await further advice."" ""There has been an incursion by a significant number of demonstrators into our embassy premises, including vandalism to our property,"" the Foreign Office said earlier. ""We are outraged by this. It is utterly unacceptable and we condemn it."" The U.N. Security Council condemned the incursion ""in the strongest terms"" in New York. Its statement called on Iran ""to protect diplomatic and consular property and personnel, and to respect fully their international obligations in this regard."" The White House condemned the incident and ""urged Iran to fully respect its international obligations, to condemn the incident, to prosecute the offenders, and to ensure that no further such incidents take place either at the British Embassy or any other mission in Iran."" ""Our State Department is in close contact with the British government and we stand ready to support our allies at this difficult time,"" the White House said. The Russian Foreign Ministry also condemned the protesters' actions. ""We are expressing our support for the British diplomats. We hope that the Iranian authorities will take necessary measures to immediately restore order, investigate the incident and prevent a repeat of such incidents,"" the ministry said in a written statement. The demonstration followed a vote Sunday by the Iranian Parliament to expel the ambassador and reduce diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom in retaliation for newly imposed Western sanctions, according to Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, or IRNA. Alaedi Boroujerd, the member of Parliament who introduced the measure, was quoted by IRNA as saying the students' protest was ""the crystallization of their pure inner feelings."" ""As declared many times before, because of its behavior, Britain is hated by the Iranian nation throughout history,"" he said, according to IRNA. However, he also was quoted as saying Iran respects all international rules and the Vienna Convention, and no country or their embassies should have any further worries, including the British. The British Foreign Office called the Iranian Parliament's vote Sunday ""regrettable."" ""This unwarranted move will do nothing to help the regime address their growing isolation or international concerns about their nuclear program and human rights record,"" the office said in a written statement. ""If the Iranian government acts on this, we will respond robustly in consultation with our international partners."" Britain cut all financial ties with Iran last week over concerns about Iran's nuclear program, the first time it has cut an entire country's banking sector off from British finance, the British Treasury announced. All British credit and financial institutions were ordered to end their business relationships and transactions with all Iranian banks, their branches and subsidiaries by Monday. The move came after an International Atomic Energy Agency report highlighted new concerns about ""the possible military dimensions of Iran's nuclear program,"" the Treasury statement said Monday. ""The IAEA's report last week provided further credible and detailed evidence about the possible military dimensions of the Iranian nuclear program,"" Hague said in a statement last Monday. ""Today we have responded resolutely by introducing a set of new sanctions that prohibit all business with Iranian banks."" Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful and has called the U.N. watchdog's report ""unbalanced"" and ""politically motivated."" The British sanctions underline ""the severity of the government's concerns about Iran's activities,"" Britain's chancellor of the exchequer said. The chancellor's statement said other ""partner countries"" will make similar announcements about banking sanctions against Iran. Iran's proposal mandates the Foreign Ministry to adopt similar positions against any other countries that impose the same policies as Britain, IRNA reported. CNN's Antonia Mortensen, Claudia Rebaza, Shirzad Bozorgmehr and Mitra Mobasherat contributed to this report.","Cameron: The embassy incursion was ""outrageous and indefensible""

"(EW.com) -- The last time we saw him on our TV sets, T. R. Knight was playing ""Grey's Anatomy""'s beloved Dr. George O'Malley before he met an untimely end in 2009. In his first television role since (he's been continuing a successful stage career), Knight plays somewhat against type: George O'Malley was the bumbling, baby-faced surgeon with a nervous smile and horrible luck with women; his latest character, Gabriel Thomas from last night's ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,"" is an alleged (SPOILER ALERT!) ""power-reassurance serial rapist"" with a neck tattoo -- sure, the tat is of a yin-yang symbol -- but still, a neck tattoo pretty much never screams ""nice guy."" Gabriel sure looks like George, but that's where the similarities end. Like George, Gabriel's into blonds, but only of the submissive variety -- that would certainly exclude Izzie Stevens. It's rather inspired to cast an actor so associated with a recognizably benevolent character in such a disturbing role (sort of the effect Elijah Wood had as the expressionless, evil Kevin in ""Sin City""). Seeing Knight go from a bright-eyed family man one moment to a sinister predator who snarls, ""Tell me you love me, Mommy"" to the women he's assaulting (ick) in the next is appropriately chilling. And, as it turns out, the dichotomy makes even more sense as, in a twist typical of this long-in-the-tooth series, Knight is pulling a Sarah Michelle Gellar and playing estranged identical twins, one of whom has a seemingly charmed life whereas the other's is in serious shambles. It may be a long shot, but for fans, his appearance on ""Law & Order"" might be a sign of more T. R. to come. In the enduring spirit of cross-promotion, NBC seems to use ""SVU"" as a testing ground for future series leads. Beautiful relationships between NBC and stars often begin in that famous interrogation room. Just look at Hayden Panettiere's two roles ramping up to Heroes, and Maria Bello's significant role last season en route to Prime Suspect (which really is getting better -- save that show!). Even though Knight's return to TV was welcome in my eyes, I found his performance weirdly unsatisfying. He didn't get to sink his teeth into his role(s) as much as I'd hoped because a lot of the episode was devoted to initiating new detectives Nick Amaro (Danny Pino) and Amanda Rollins (Kelli Giddish); plus, his characters' Southern accent sounded a bit inconsistent -- anyone else notice that?

"(CNN) -- The 32-year-old Texas man who died in a shark attack over the weekend while scuba diving off Western Australia was remembered Sunday by his sisters as ""unique"" and ""one of a kind."" Sharon Wainwright of Panama City, Florida, identified the victim as her son, George Thomas Wainwright. His sisters, Brenda Wainwright and Wanda Brannon, spoke to CNN affiliate WMBB-TV. ""It's devastating. It's hard to even wrap your head around. I can't believe he's gone. I think it was just wrong place, wrong time because he was very wise. I would trust him with anything to do with being on the water,"" said Brenda Wainwright. She described her brother as ""unique ... that rare combination of incredibly intelligent, very kind, great sense of humor."" Police said Saturday the man was scuba diving with two friends near Rottnest Island, a popular tourist destination about 15 miles off the Australian mainland, when the attack occurred. The man's friends, who were not in the water at the time, noticed an abnormal amount of air bubbles rising to the surface in the area where he was diving, followed by a plume of blood, said police spokesman Michael Wear. Moments later, the man's body rose to the surface. Police said he succumbed to his injuries not long after the incident. Following a preliminary review of bite marks on the body, authorities said he is believed to have been killed by a great white shark. ""He was in the water by himself, I believe,"" Sgt. Greg True of Western Australia police told CNN affiliate Channel Nine. ""There's been some pretty massive injuries inflicted."" Sharon Wainwright told CNN her family was notified of the incident Saturday morning. Authorities said the man had been living in Western Australia. Wainright's relatives expect his body to arrive in Florida in about four days, Sharon Wainwright said. Saturday's attack was the second fatal shark attack in the past two weeks near the city of Perth, capital of the state of Western Australia. ""He was one of a kind,"" the victim's sister, Brannon, told WMBB. ""He's more than just a quick news spot. He was our brother and we loved him. He will be missed.""

"New York (CNN) -- A group of union-backed organizations joined the loosely defined Occupy Wall Street movement again Tuesday, leaving behind the confines of New York's financial district for the posh neighborhoods that dot Manhattan's Upper East Side, according to multiple group representatives. Crowds also swelled in Lower Manhattan's Zuccotti Park, where demonstrators waved placards and chanted slogans attacking corporate greed and social inequality. The union-organized march, meanwhile, took protesters past the homes of well-to-do residents like billionaire David Koch, News Corp. CEO Rupert Murdoch and JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. Organizations such as UnitedNY, the Strong Economy for All Coalition, the Working Families Party, and New York Communities for Change were accompanied by protesters typically based in Zuccotti Park, a privately owned park in New York's financial district. The Upper East Side march was ""in support"" of the Occupy Wall Street movement, but was not organized by it, said T.J. Helmstetter, a spokesman for Working Families Party, a coalition of New York community and labor groups. Protesters hopped on the subway, emerging at Fifth Avenue and 59th Street near Central Park, where organizers held a press conference that addressed both New York-centric themes, such as state taxes, and the movement's broader concerns of social inequity. ""We are the 99%,"" the group chanted, a reference to their insistence that most Americans lack the influence in their country's political and financial affairs enjoyed by the elite 1%. ""I think it's time that these people realize that people are hurting in this country and it's time to reform what's going on in Washington,"" said New York resident Lenore Silverstein, who attended Tuesday's march. Emily Monroe , a North Carolina college student and marcher, said the city's wealthiest ""are buying billion-dollar apartments and living lavishly, while we are just trying to sustain ourselves."" ""The American dream is no longer possible because these people are stealing from the middle class,"" she told CNN Radio. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, meanwhile, said authorities will defend protesters' right to demonstrate, but he doesn't appreciate ""the bashing of all of the hardworking people who live and work here."" ""Our city depends on the jobs that the financial services industry provides,"" Bloomberg said during a news conference in the Bronx. He added that he didn't understand what the picketing of wealthy and prominent New Yorkers is intended to achieve. The mayor's comments coincided with a state comptroller report released Tuesday that predicts Wall Street could lose an additional 10,000 jobs by the end of next year, raising the total number of jobs lost in the securities industry since 2008 to 32,000. Earlier, in Boston, 129 protesters were arrested during a similar demonstration Tuesday, mostly for ""unlawful assembly and trespassing,"" said police spokesman Eddy Chrispin. The group allegedly blocked traffic and refused to disperse while marching to ""areas of the city where they hadn't been previously,"" he said. Protesters have been occupying Dewey Square Park in downtown Boston, but expanded to the neighboring Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway on Monday night. Protesters were given a 1:30 a.m. deadline to move back to Dewey Square. Those who did not were arrested. The nationwide Occupy movement has been largely peaceful, though it has led to some skirmishes with police and arrests. It has also stoked fervent public debate, including among politicians. Democrats have generally offered sympathy for protesters' concerns while several Republicans, among them 2012 presidential candidates Herman Cain and Newt Gingrich, have described the demonstrations as ""class warfare."" The movement shows few signs of slowing down. Rallies and marches have been held in numerous towns and cities in recent days, with many more planned. That includes a ""Call to Action Against Banks"" planned for Saturday, which New York's Occupy Wall Street announced on its Facebook site. ""No longer will banks take our homes. No longer will banks rob students of our future. No longer will banks destroy the environment. No longer will banks fund the misery of war. No longer will banks cause massive unemployment. And no longer will banks create and profit from economic crisis without a struggle,"" according to the online message Monday. It then urges people to ""visit your local Bank of America, Wells Fargo or Chase (branches) and let them know, we will not allow business as usual."" ""We. Will. Occupy. Everywhere,"" the posting ends.

"(CNN) -- The United States are aiming to win the Solheim Cup for a fourth successive occasion when they face Europe in the 12th edition of the women's team golf tournament, which begins at the Killeen Castle Golf Resort in Ireland on Friday. The competition, an exact replica of the men's Ryder Cup, begins on Friday morning with four foursomes, where the players alternate playing the same ball, before the afternoon's four fourballs -- which sees each player playing their own ball. Saturday's two sessions then follow exactly the same format, before Sunday's 12 individual singles, which will determine the winners. With a total of 28 points up for grabs, the winning team is the first to reach 14 1/2 points, with the Americans securing 16-12 triumphs in Illinois in 2009 and Sweden in 2007. Alison Nicholas, who is captaining Europe for a second time following their 2009 defeat, has paired Maria Hjorth and Anna Nordqvist in the opening foursomes match -- with the Swedish duo lining up against Michelle Wie and Cristie Kerr. The English duo of Karen Stupples and Melissa Reid face Paula Creamer and Brittany Lincicome in the second of the foursomes, while the third sees veteran Scot Catriona Matthew and Spanish rookie Azahara Munoz against Stacy Lewis and Angela Stanford. And Friday's morning session is completed by Suzann Pettersen of Norway and Sweden's Sophie Gustafson facing Brittany Lang and Juli Inkster -- who becomes the oldest-ever Solheim Cup player at the age of 51. The United States lead Europe 8-3 overall and both Nicholas and her American counterpart Rosie Jones are aware of the need to get a good start in the competition. Nicholas told the official Solheim Cup website: ""I think I have a good blend in my team and I am very happy with the way the draw has worked out. ""Catriona, for instance, is a great leader and gets on so well with everyone. She has lots of experience and I think she will make a great pairing with Azahara. They are both steady players."" The United States come into the match as favorites to retain their title, with four of the world's top 10 amongst their ranks. ""I've put Michelle and Cristie out first because they are both good leaders,"" Jones told the official website. ""They have played a lot together and had success. I want them to get out there and put up a point."" She continued: ""I've got heavy hitters in every match. I have a master plan and I'm going to stick to it as much as possible. But you have to wait and see how the matches go and maybe adjust.""

"(CNN) -- An international footballer who played for the United Arab Emirates, and who became an internet sensation after scoring a backheeled penalty, has died following a car accident near the country's capital, Abu Dhabi. Theyab Awana, a 21-year-old winger for local club Bani Yas, was one of the country's brightest prospects after winning the 2008 AFC Under 18 Cup and was instrumental in the UAE reaching the quarterfinals of the 2009 FIFA Under 20 World Cup. ""Theyab Awana has passed away on Sunday night after a horrible traffic accident on Sheikh Zayed Road in Abu Dhabi,"" the UAE Football Association confirmed in a statement on Monday. ""God blesses his soul and wholehearted condolences to his family, friends and fans."" Last year he won a silver medal at the 2010 Asian Games after the UAE reached the final and had been picked for both senior and Olympic national teams. But it was his actions during a friendly against Lebanon in July that brought him international recognition. With the UAE leading 5-2, Awana stepped up to take a penalty. Instead of conventionally striking the ball he twisted around and backheeled the ball into the corner of the net. He was immediately substituted by then coach Srecko Katanec, who was angry at what he saw was a lack of respect for the opposition. Yet the fans didn't agree. Instead the YouTube clip of his penalty went viral. More than 1.2 million people have since viewed it. ""On behalf of AFC and the Asian football family, I would like to offer my sincere condolences to the UAE football community, family and friends of Awana,"" the Asian Football Confederation's acting president Zhang Jilong said in a statement. Awana's death comes soon after another young Emirati player Saeed al Nooby, who played for second division side Al Dhafra, also died in a car accident. ""We had just returned last night with the club officials and players after visiting the family of Saeed al Nooby and paying our condolences,"" Bani Yas' Brazilian coach Jorvan Vieira told the Dubai-based newspaper the Gulf News. ""An hour later I got a call from the club's manager informing me of the accident and I rushed to the hospital but Awana had died. ""It will take some time for the club and his teammates to get over Awana's death. We have lost a man, a player and a boy and it will be hard to replace him.""","UAE international footballer Theyab Awana killed in a car accident .

"(CNN) -- Renewable energy is generating a lot of political heat. The bankruptcy of solar-panel manufacturer Solyndra, after a half billion dollar loan from the Federal government, has set off a hot debate on Capitol Hill. And a group of American-based solar companies are demanding 100% tariffs on imports of Chinese solar panels. They charge that China unfairly competes by subsidizing the Chinese industry, which Beijing resolutely denies. All this, however, is occurring against a larger backdrop. Around the world renewable energy is going through a rebirth. It is becoming a big business. It is also becoming a more established part of the world's overall energy supply. Last year, $120 billion was spent to install renewable electricity generation worldwide. Yet it is still a relatively small business compared to the overall energy business, and one that still faces big challenges in getting to scale on a global basis. The position of renewable energy is very different from where it was even a decade ago. The modern renewable industry -- wind, solar, and other forms of energy -- was born with a great deal of excitement in the 1970s and early 1980s. But the early hopes soon crashed on the harsh reality of lower energy prices and the fact that the technologies were still immature and not yet ready for primetime. The subsequent years were tough. For many people in the renewable business, the late 1980s and 1990s are remembered as the ""valley of death"" as the pioneers struggled to hang on, often by their fingernails. But around the beginning of this century, several things came together to breathe new life into the field. Now, it was not only concerns about energy security and general environmental protection, which had stimulated the first boom. The rise of climate change as a central issue in energy policy drove governments to much more actively promote carbon-free electricity. The European Union's energy policy is now predicated on using renewables to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 80% by 2050. The other is the rapidly growing energy needs of emerging market countries such as China and India. They have turned to renewables as part of their future supply. As a senior official in Beijing told me, China used to regard the fierce winds in its northwest as a ""natural disaster,"" but now they are prized as a ""very precious resource."" But it would be a mistake, as is sometimes said, to assume that China has embraced renewables as the only solution. In order to meet its rapidly growing needs for energy, China is pursuing all options -- oil and coal and natural gas and nuclear power, as well as renewables. Over the last decade, growing support by governments for renewable energy has been critical to its development. Germany and Denmark took the lead in repowering renewables with a new system of electricity rates that blended the higher cost of renewable power into the overall price. As a result, consumers do not see the direct cost of the renewables when it comes time to pay their bills. In the United States, both federal and state governments provide tax incentives and subsidies that have been critical in stimulating demand, with the aim of increasing output and reducing costs. Moreover, an increasing number of states now require that a certain percentage of electricity must be renewable -- the so-called ""renewable portfolio standards."" The most aggressive of all is California, where about 15% of electricity today is renewable. Earlier this year, Gov. Jerry Brown signed a new law requiring that a third of California's electricity be renewable by 2020. This is considered extremely ambitious, especially given the state's difficult economic situation and a 12% unemployment rate. Renewables need to overcome two big hurdles. One is that the sun does not shine all the time, and wind does not blow all the time. As the renewable share of electric power goes up, this ""intermittency"" will be a bigger concern. One solution is more use of natural gas as renewables' ""partner"" -- to generate electricity at those times when the sun and wind are off duty. Another -- the subject of much research -- is to find some way to store electricity in large scale. Success there would be a major breakthrough for renewable energy . The other challenge is costs. Renewables are carbon free. But, without direct incentives and subsidies, renewables are still generally more expensive than competing sources. Technology also is critical. A ""great bubbling"" of innovation is at work all across the energy spectrum, conventional as well as alternatives. In the case of renewables, much of the focus is on cost reduction. And certainly the technological advance is evident. A wind turbine today is a far larger and more sophisticated machine than a wind turbine of the 1980s, and it may produce as much as a hundred times more electricity. The costs of solar energy continue to come down, and many of the new approaches under development and in the lab are aimed at further cost reductions. To achieve big impact, however, renewables still need to establish that they are competitive at large scale. And they are not there yet. Indeed, they have run into an unexpected new challenge. This comes from the recent appearance of large volumes of low-cost natural gas, known as shale gas, which is extremely competitive as a fuel for electricity generation. That adds to the cost pressures on renewable energy. In the first half of 2011, renewables constituted 9% of total U.S. energy. But over 80% of that renewable energy comes from three sources -- hydropower, which has been around a long time; wood, which has been around even longer; and biofuels, primarily ethanol in gasoline. Wind and solar are small, but they are growing. Wind today constitutes over 3% of U.S. electricity. Solar is much, much smaller. As costs go down, more solar will come into use around the world. Solar panels will proliferate both on rooftops and in generating stations. As much as 6% of the capacity installed between now and 2025 could be solar. But, in total, because of the huge size of the global electric power industry, it would only constitute 1% of total electricity supply. In other words, wind and solar have much ground to cover, and it will take time. But they have been growing fast, and in the past few years, wind has been one of the main choices of many utilities for new generation. Wind-generated electricity today in the United States is 20 times greater than it was a decade ago. Overall, renewables are destined to grow. There will be cycles, and hills and valleys to cross -- but no more ""valley of death."" Renewable will be part of a growing global business that will be measured in hundreds of billions of dollars. But how big a role will they have in keeping on our lights and powering our computers and all the other proliferating gadgets on which we depend? That will be determined by a mix of government policy, technological advance, the world's energy needs -- and by sheer economics. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Daniel Yergin.","Daniel Yergin: Solyndra failure doesn't mean renewable energy is in trouble .

"(CNN) -- Wing Bryan Habana became South Africa's all-time leading try scorer on Thursday as the Springboks thrashed Namibia 87-0 at the Rugby World Cup in New Zealand. The 28-year-old went over for the reigning world champions in the first half for his 39th Test try -- his first since a score against Italy in June 2010 -- to move clear of previous record-holder Joost van der Westhuizen. The two-time World Cup winners registered 11 other tries to extend their winning run at the four-yearly tournament to 10 matches, and also condemn Namibia to elimination at the pool stage for the fourth competition in a row. South Africa's comprehensive victory also secured an unwanted record for Namibia, who suffered a 14th successive World Cup defeat -- the worst run in the tournament's 24-year history. After an error-ridden first half, the Springboks scored six tries in the final 20 minutes in only their second encounter with their African neighbors following a 105-13 romp in a warm-up game four years ago. ""The first 40 minutes we had a few bad habits which happens as you often get different types of opposition at the World Cup,"" winning captain John Smit told the tournament website. ""It was a good chance for us to refocus at halftime, and we had better shape in the second half and got more rewards. We are making progress. Tonight was a good run-out."" Flyhalf Morne Steyn set the 1995 and 2007 champions on their way when he kicked a successful penalty after three minutes, before wing Gio Aplon went over for the game's first try three minutes later. Habana touched down for his historic score on 21 minutes, with South Africa awarded a penalty try after Namibia were overpowered in the scrum on the half-hour. Center Jaque Fourie registered South Africa's fourth and final try of the opening period after 38 minutes, before Steyn again converted to make the halftime score 31-0. Center Francois Steyn added to the tally after the break, and Morne Steyn continued his perfect record in the match by successfully converting before notching a try of his own on the hour mark. The tries kept coming for the Springboks with center Juan de Jongh coming off the bench to go over the Namibia line with 63 minutes gone, and scrumhalf Ruan Pienaar -- on as a replacement for kicker Steyn -- converted to make the score 54-0. There was a second try for the 28-year-old Aplon, before a brace from flyhalf Derick Hougaard and further scores from de Jongh and forward Danie Rossouw completed the rout. South Africa are now in a strong position to reach the quarterfinals ahead of their fourth and final Pool D match with second-placed Samoa on September 30, while Namibia face Wales, who also have last-eight aspirations, in New Plymouth on Monday. The Boks are on 14 points, eight clear of Samoa -- who like Wales, on five, have two matches to play.","South Africa thrash Namibia 87-0 at the Rugby World Cup in New Zealand .

"New York (CNN) -- For New Yorkers, a gambling fix is now just a subway ride away. The first casino in New York City opened Friday at the Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens to thousands of eager gamblers, some waiting hours to get in. ""It was such a hassle to get in, but I'm glad I'm here,"" said Carmen Beverly, who said she took the subway to the casino from her home in nearby Brooklyn. ""Not winning anything yet, but I'm having fun."" The Resorts World Casino hit capacity almost immediately after opening, organizers said. Lines stretched around the building as police struggled to contain hundreds of people hoping for opening-day luck. Backers of the casino said they hope its close proximity to the airport and the subway will make it a draw for New Yorkers and tourists alike. It is the first casino to be built in New York City since the state legislature paved the way for its construction during the post-September 11, 2001, economic slump. ""Finally New York gets money,"" said Helen Alamia, a slots player who said she would no longer travel to out-of-state casinos. ""We're giving it to Pennsylvania and Jersey, now New York gets it, I'm very happy."" Because of a technicality in the 2001 law, the casino features only video games, no live dealers. Nonetheless, Gordon Medenica, director of the New York Lottery, espoused the casino's contribution to state funds. ""This facility will probably increase our video lottery income by 50%,"" Medenica said. Video lottery is the organization's fastest-growing source of income, he said. Some customers expressed disappointment that they would not be able to gamble with a live dealer, but most seemed happy just to have a casino nearby. Billboards for the casino advertise it as being ""minutes, not hours away,"" a clear swipe at the more well-known -- and farther away -- gambling sites of Atlantic City, New Jersey, and Indian reservations such as Foxwoods in Connecticut. ""It's not competition with Las Vegas,"" said Mike Speller, president of Resorts World Casino. ""We are 10 minutes from JFK -- 55 million customers a year come in there. We are 25 minutes from Manhattan -- another 50 million tourists come in there. So we think it's going to be a very, very busy place.""","Some visitors wait hours to get in to the casino in Queens .

"(CNN) -- To be a Texas Rangers baseball fan doesn't compare to the prestige of growing up in the shadows of Yankee Stadium, Fenway Park or Wrigley Field. The pinstriped jerseys, classic uniforms and ball caps of those Major League Baseball teams are timeless and have become iconic touchstones in pop culture. It's easy to be a baseball fan if you root for teams with rich history like the New York Yankees, Boston Red Sox and both Chicago teams, the Cubs and White Sox. Baseball purists must have cringed back in 1972 when the Rangers unveiled the team logo of a baseball wearing a 10-gallon cowboy hat. Calling the Rangers your team meant you truly loved baseball. What's the power of a good luck charm? The Yankees spent decades playing in the ""House that Babe Ruth Built"" while the Rangers spent most of my childhood playing in an uninspired location. The ""stadium"" was a converted minor-league field that looked like an open-air county arena better suited for rodeos than baseball games. But it was our Ebbets Field. Just hours before Opening Day in 1975, a helicopter was brought in to hover over the wet field to dry out two days worth of rain. The result? The chopper crashed and gashed the field just beyond third base. It would take another 20 years for the Texas Rangers to taste the playoffs. But the ""Curse of the Rotor Blade"" doesn't have the same mystique as the Red Sox's ""Curse of the Bambino"" or the Cubs' ""Curse of the Billy Goat."" The Rangers team was a collection of misfit has-beens and never-would-bes who made every kid think, ""If these guys can be ballplayers, surely I can be one, too."" April 12, 1991, was my chance to impress the Rangers scouts. Before the game, I was invited to play in a fly-ball catching contest. After hearing the stadium announcer call my name, I trotted out onto the hallowed grass of Arlington Stadium. A pitching machine launched the first two fly balls toward me, and with thousands of people watching, I snagged both balls. One more catch and the entire stadium would be rewarded with a free medium soft drink from Wendy's. This is where I learned never to underestimate America's love for winning free stuff no matter how trivial it might be. The crowd came to its feet and erupted into the loudest cheers I think I've ever heard. The machine launched a major league pop fly that seemed to take forever to come down. As I started to fall over I put my glove up and felt the ball smack the leather webbing. I got up, looked into the glove and it was still there. That was the first time I was able to scream, ""Free drinks for everyone!"" I ran off the field in glory. I still have that ball. I had all my buddies with me that day autograph it, just like real ball players do. Chicago has its ""Lovable Losers"" in the Cubs. Rangers fans needed Lone Star beer to love its losers. Even the most fanatic baseball fan is hard-pressed to name the players who we called our own. Pete O'Brien, Larry Parrish, Oddibe McDowell, Jeff Russell, Gary Ward. Who? We watched a guy named Charlie Hough throw 50 mph knuckleballs and then puff on cigarettes in the dugout between innings. We went to the stadium and bought $4 outfield seats. All for the privilege of watching terrible baseball in the scorching Texas heat, suffering third-degree burns from sitting on the metal bleacher seats. In those early years, the season of hope was usually short-lived. You could count on the Rangers to be out of playoff contention by the end of May, which was fine. We had bigger things to focus on, like the Dallas Cowboys packing their bags for training camp. The losing kept the bleacher seats cheap, which was fine for most fans. One of the best days of my life was witnessing the Rangers battle the Red Sox on April 30, 1989, on my father's birthday. I still have the ticket stub. Hall-of-Famer Nolan Ryan pitched for the Rangers, and future accused steroid user Roger Clemens pitched for the Red Sox. An epic matchup that turned out to be an epic game. We witnessed poetic pitching. Ryan struck out 11 batters. I was in awe. Ryan and Clemens cruised but the Red Sox had a 1-0 lead in the bottom of the eighth inning. Until our favorite Cuban-exile came to the plate, Rafael Palmeiro stroked a beautiful two-run home run down the right field. The Rangers won 2-1. Outside the stadium after the game, I got Nolan Ryan to autograph my baseball, and then I tried to get Roger Clemens' autograph and learned a valuable lesson from my dad. Clemens was intimidating. My dad patted me on the back and said, ""Don't be afraid. Go up to him and ask him for an autograph."" With quivering hands I gave Clemens the ball. Clemens took the ball, and now I can say I'm the proud owner of Roger Clemens scribble. Most days I've spent watching Rangers baseball haven't compared to that day. But we Cubans love our baseball, and we'll take it any way we can get it. In the early 1990s, baseball started to change. The old stadium was bulldozed and replaced with a shrine more fitting of a noble baseball team. The Rangers flirted with the playoffs three times in the late-1990s. They played 10 games and lost nine. It's the kind of angst and teasing that only Cubs and Red Sox fans can truly appreciate. That brush with success didn't last long. The Rangers ushered in another decade of abysmal baseball that took the team to the brink of bankruptcy. That is until February 2008, when Nolan Ryan and the new ownership group rode into town and saved the day. In 2010, under Ryan's leadership, the Rangers made it to the World Series for the first time in franchise history. SI.com: Rangers' Ron Washington: World Series hero or goat . These modern-day Rangers are a different story. The players probably aren't as fun and crazy as the misfits who sported the long-gone logo of the baseball wearing a 10-gallon cowboy hat, but the team's manager, Ron Washington, is a throwback to the good old days. Washington dances, struts, mangles the English language in a beautiful way and frantically chomps on sunflower seeds. He is a baseball genius with the heart of a 12-year-old kid cheering the team. In Ron Washington's world, ""That's the way baseball go!"" Now the Texas Rangers are on the brink of being World Series champions. The Cardinals, Yankees, Red Sox and Cubs fans look on with envy at a franchise that spent decades as a laughingstock. No one ever imagined we could even have a World Series parade to plan. Arlington, Texas, (where the Rangers play) has a downtown not worthy of a World Series party. But there is a Six Flags amusement park next to the stadium. Instead of a parade, I think fans should ride the roller coasters with the players. That would be a fitting way to celebrate a tear-jerking relationship full of ups and downs.","The Texas Rangers are on the brink of winning their first World Series .

"(CNN) -- Back in 2006, volunteers with No More Deaths, a humanitarian organization dedicated to helping migrants along the Arizona-Mexico border, began hearing the same stories from many who had been in the custody of the U.S. Border Patrol. Thwarted would-be unauthorized immigrants spoke of being denied water or food during their custody. Others said they were beaten. The organization started properly documenting these allegations, and the stories added up to nearly 13,000 testimonies whose results were released in a report this week. The findings went beyond denial of food and water. Migrants held by the Border Patrol spoke of being exposed to extreme heat or cold, sleep deprivation, death threats, and psychological abuse such as blaring music with lyrics about migrants dying in the desert. A previous report by No More Deaths in 2008 raised the same concerns, but now the number of recorded cases point to a systematic problem. ""By this point, the overwhelming weight of the corroborated evidence should eliminate any doubt that Border Patrol abuse is widespread,"" the report states. The Border Patrol responded with a statement highlighting the fact that respect for detainees is taught in training and consistently reinforced during an agent's career. ""Mistreatment or agent misconduct will not be tolerated in any way,"" the statement said. ""We appreciate the efforts of individuals to report concerns as soon as they arise and we will continue to cooperate fully with any effort to investigate allegations of agent misconduct or mistreatment of individuals."" The interviews were conducted with migrants in Naco, Nogales and Agua Prieta, in Mexico's Sonora state who were in border patrol custody. Although No More Deaths conducted thousands of interviews, in places like Nogales they could only speak with a fraction of the migrants who crossed. This raised the issue of how representative their sample was, said Katerina Sinclair, a statistical consultant on the report. But in Naco, a smaller town, they were able to speak with enough migrants to have a representative sample. So the report stays away from making conclusions about percentages except for the subset of interviewees from Naco. But despite the difficulties with such an ambitious project, the authors say that the numbers on their own are cause for concern. Some 2,981 people reported they were denied food, and more than 11,000 said they were given insufficient food by the Border Patrol, the report states. The report found that 863 people, many of whom were already dehydrated, were denied water. There were nearly 6,000 cases of overcrowding reported, and almost 3,000 people had at least some personal belongings not returned, the report states. In addition, 869 people -- including 17 children and 41 teenagers -- reported that they were split from their families and deported separately. No More Deaths also recorded instances of sleep deprivation, death threats, and the forced holding of strenuous positions. ""There's no question that there is systematic abuse of people in Border Patrol custody,"" Danielle Alvarado, one of the report's authors, told CNN. Although the research focused on migrants in the Arizona border area, the findings are consistent with reports from Border Patrol sectors across the country, she said. ""This systematic abuse must be confronted aggressively at the institutional level, not denied or dismissed as a series of aberrational incidents attributable to a few rogue agents,"" the report states. In its statement, the Border Patrol responded that, ""on a daily basis, agents make every effort to ensure that people in our custody are given food, water, and medical attention as needed."" ""The sad reality is that between what they say on paper and the day-to-day reality there is a big disconnect,"" Alvarado said. Brandon Judd, president of Local 2544, the Tucson branch of the National Border Patrol Council, said that it is No More Deaths' report that is disconnected from reality. Border patrol agents are law-abiding citizens who believe in accountability, he said. ""If these allegations are true, these are crimes,"" he said. There are 3,000 agents in the Tucson Sector of the Border Patrol, Judd said, and one complaint every two weeks would be considered a lot. Agents also police themselves, he said. ""I can tell you that our agents are the ones who report mistreatment if they see it,"" he said. He was skeptical about the types of questions that were asked and the credibility of the interviewees who were freshly repatriated. ""There's some glaring weaknesses in the story,"" he said. But Sinclair said that care was taken to make sure that all conclusions were drawn from the Naco sample, which also happened to report the lowest rate of incidents. The questions were also phrased in a way to give credit to the Border Patrol where due. ""We gave them every benefit of the doubt,"" she said. But their research shows that ""it only gets worse from here."" ""It just doesn't ring true,"" Judd said. The reports of abuses come as the number of apprehensions along the border has decreased. Increased border enforcement and a slow economic recovery in the United States have reduced the amount of illegal traffic across the border. Also, No More Deaths reported, the demographics of those being deported have changed. A number of the migrants they interviewed were older and had been in the United States longer. One sample of 100 migrants revealed an average of 14.4 years of living in the United States before deportation. In light of its report, its authors argue for legally enforceable standards, and a tougher oversight mechanism. From October of last year to the present, about 115,000 migrants were apprehended by the Border Patrol's Tucson Sector.","Organization spoke with nearly 13,000 migrants .

"Washington (CNN) -- As Libyans in the United States cheered the death of Moammar Gadhafi, President Barack Obama on Thursday called the fate of the former Libyan leader both the end of a ""long and painful chapter for the people of Libya"" and the hallmark of a successful U.S. foreign policy. In the first official government remarks on the killing of a longtime foe who was behind terrorist attacks against U.S. citizens, Obama pledged American support as Libya builds a democratic system from the ruins of dictatorship. ""You have won your revolution,"" he said to the Libyan people. Obama also praised the efforts of U.S. military personnel who took part in the NATO-led military mission that launched thousands of airstrikes in support of Libya's rebel forces. ""Without putting a single U.S. service member on the ground, we achieved our objectives,"" Obama said in heralding a strategy that ""demonstrated what collective action can achieve in the 21st century."" In an obvious reference to Syria and the crackdown on dissent by President Bashar al-Assad, Obama noted that Gadhafi's death proved ""once more that the rule of an iron fist inevitably comes to an end."" ""Across the Arab world, citizens have stood up to claim their rights,"" the president said. ""Youth are delivering a powerful rebuke to dictatorship, and those leaders who try to deny human dignity will not succeed."" His statement, delivered in the White House Rose Garden, followed hours of silence by top government officials as initial reports that Gadhafi had been captured or killed emerged from Libya. It was a very different scene hours later outside the White House, as dozens of people waved and wrapped themselves in the Libyan flag while cheering Gadhafi's death. Many sang to the beat of a drum Thursday evening, while one celebrant held a hand-drawn sign showing a newborn baby drawn over the outline of Libya -- symbolizing a country reborn. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was in Afghanistan when she said ""Wow"" after an aide handed her a Blackberry that spoke of Gadhafi's capture. At the time, she stressed the reports were ""unconfirmed"" and noted similar stories had proven false, . Politicians were less reticent, especially as it became more clear that Gadhafi was in fact dead. Sens. John Kerry and John McCain, both foreign affairs veterans, were among several legislators who remarked about Gadhafi's death long before Obama issued his statement. McCain, an Arizona Republican who lost to Obama in the 2008 presidential election, called it a ""great day"" and said the administration he previously criticized for withholding full U.S. military capacity in Libya ""deserves great credit."" ""Obviously, I had different ideas on the tactical side, but ... the world is a better place, and the Libyan people now have a chance,"" McCain told CNN. Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat, said Obama's policy of building a NATO-led coalition for the Libya mission ""demonstrated clear-eyed leadership, patience and foresight by pushing the international community into action."" ""Though the administration was criticized both for moving too quickly and for not moving quickly enough, it is undeniable that the NATO campaign prevented a massacre and contributed mightily to Gadhafi's undoing without deploying boots on the ground or suffering a single American fatality,"" Kerry said. Rep. Mike Rogers, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, cheered the news that Gadhafi's ""brutal regime is finally over."" At the same time, the Michigan Republican stressed what he deemed an urgent need to secure ""Libya's large stockpile of chemical and other advanced weapons"" in this period of transition. Vice President Joe Biden noted that the U.S. role in the campaign cost no more than $2 billion and that no American lives were lost, saying: ""This is more a prescription about how we ought to deal going forward. ""We do not have to do it ourselves. ... The NATO alliance worked like it was designed to do,"" Biden told CNN's Candy Crowley in New Hampshire, calling Gadhafi ""one bad guy. This was real burden sharing."" According to figures from the Pentagon and State Department, the total bill as of September 30 for the U.S. role in the Libya campaign was about $1.3 billion. However, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida complained that Obama's strategy unnecessarily extended the conflict by withholding full U.S. involvement and firepower. ""If the U.S. had gotten involved early, aggressively and decisively, today would have happened months ago,"" Rubio said. ""Sometimes you don't just have to do the right thing. You have to do the right thing at the right time, and I think this administration failed to do that."" The news of Gadhafi's death marked the end of the seven-month NATO-led Libya campaign initially spearheaded by the United States to prevent Gadhafi's forces from attacking Benghazi, the opposition stronghold. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen announced Thursday, hours after Gadhafi was killed, that the alliance ""will terminate our mission"" in the North African nation. Clinton visited the Libyan capital of Tripoli this week, making her the highest-level U.S. government official to go to the country since 2008. In a CNN interview in Afghanistan as the reports of Gadhafi's death were emerging, Clinton said Libya's governing National Transition Council didn't want to begin the process of forming a new government until Gadhafi was captured or killed, fearing ""security problems."" While challenges remain for Libya, Clinton said that Gadhafi's absence -- meaning that he cannot marshal popular support, pay for mercenaries or lead a guerrilla warfare campaign -- would make ""a big difference."" ""(His death brings) a lot of legitimacy and validation and relief to the formation of the new government,"" she said. The killing of Gadhafi also raises anew the question of whether a Libyan convicted of helping bomb Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988, killing 270 people, would be forced to resume serving a prison sentence in Scotland. Abdelbeset al-Megrahi returned to a hero's welcome in Libya two years ago after his humanitarian release from a Scottish prison due to advanced cancer. He is still alive today, and some U.S. legislators have mounted a vigorous campaign for his return to prison. House Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, said the United States can be a ""willing friend and partner"" to Libya's new government if it can ""resolve all issues associated with Gadhafi's terrorism-sponsored activities."" To the brother of a victim of the Pan Am bombing, Gadhafi's death represents justice delayed but not denied. Brian Flynn said that when his brother John Patrick Flynn died, ""I promised him and myself that I wouldn't let it go, that there would be justice."" ""Today is an example that after 22 years, finally justice is done,"" Flynn said. ""I owed him that. And I feel that the Libyan people have helped me fulfill my promise to him, an example that we've been able to do that."" CNN's Alex Mooney, Kate Bolduan, Jamie Crawford, Susan Candiotti, Jill Dougherty and Adam Aigner-Treworgy contributed to this report.","NEW: Dozens outside of the White House celebrate Gadhafi's death .

"(CNN) -- Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Housing Administration own about 250,000 foreclosed properties awaiting resale. Hundreds of thousands of additional units will likely be taken over by the government and become available in the next few years. At least another 250,000 foreclosed properties are awaiting sale in the private market. This drag on the housing market is one of the reasons why housing prices continue to fall and new housing construction is stalled. All these properties could provide families with housing instead of sitting empty (and, in some cases, looking the part). To increase the use of idle government properties and recover some of the massive losses on mortgages, the Obama administration is looking mainly for proposals from firms or nonprofit organizations to buy and rent out the vacant properties. The Department of Housing and Urban Development gets a gold star for this new strategy, but pursuing another approach at the same time — helping more families become homeowners — would take us further still toward ending the housing crisis. Both approaches would reduce rents: As more renters buy vacant homes, demand for rentals will ease, and renting out vacant units will increase the supply of rental housing. Both approaches are also likely to jack up demand for idle or underemployed construction workers, who'd be needed to repair and renovate the properties. Right now, millions of families are paying more in rent than the monthly carrying costs of owning a comparable property. In 2009, 3 million families with children and annual household incomes below $30,000 were paying more than $800 per month in rent, according to the 2009 American Community Survey. If they can pay that much, they could certainly afford homes costing at least $115,000 — well above the value of homes at the 25th percentile of the price curve. With better access to financing, they could take advantage of bargain prices on foreclosed or other properties, and homeownership would immediately cut renters' housing costs and lock in great rates. Some past efforts at promoting homeownership failed when bad mortgages supported housing costs far higher than monthly rents on the expectation of home price appreciation. But that doesn't mean we can't learn from past mistakes or take advantage of the current market context to make a major dent in family housing costs by using idle housing and human resources. As we spell out in our book, ""Moving Working Families Forward,"" the government could create 1 million homeownership vouchers to cover the carrying costs of homes up to the 25th percentile of area home prices. Given today's low-home prices, such a plan would cost no more than about $3 billion per year and could be at least partially financed by phasing out the more costly and supply-oriented Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, which offers a reduction in tax liability to property owners and private investors who develop low-income housing — and is a corporate honey pot that yields high profits and relatively few units for low-income families. A second approach would use turnkey programs. Firms and nonprofit organizations would purchase homes, qualify the buyers through credit counseling and credit repair, ready buyers for homeownership, make modest renovations and repairs, and sell the properties. With this option, like the homeowner voucher, government could lay claim to a modest share of any capital gain (say 15%-20%) when the property is resold. Among others, the Neighborhood Reinvestment Group of Cleveland is already trying the turnkey approach. Starting with unused housing from the Cuyahoga County land bank, the company hired local construction workers and trained the unemployed to spiff up the units, helped renters correct and raise their credit scores enough to qualify for low interest mortgages and down payment assistance, helped them get financing, and walked the families through the sale. Some renters took classes offered in financial literacy, too. On average, the renters reduced their monthly housing expenditures by a minimum of 25%, including taxes and insurance. As the project scales up to involve scores of properties, it will create new jobs and training opportunities for underutilized construction workers. Scaling up either homeownership initiative would be a move in the right direction, and either approach would help millions of middle income and near-poor families limit their housing costs. Finally, targeting demand policies toward housing can cost-effectively reinvigorate the broader economic recovery because of the close links between construction, manufacturing, and other industries. Just as important, by taking depressed units out of the housing market, the outlook for future housing prices will improve. This will reduce future foreclosures as more homeowners will make their payments rather than walking away from their mortgage commitments.

"London (CNN) -- Singer Amy Winehouse's death this summer was the result of alcohol poisoning, an inquest ruled Wednesday, as it reached a verdict of ""death by misadventure."" A pathologist told a coroner's court in north London that alcohol toxicity was the cause of the 27-year-old's death, with her blood-alcohol levels measured at more than five times the legal limit for driving. The Grammy award-winning artist, who had battled with alcohol and drug abuse over several years, was found dead at her north London home July 23. Testimony at her inquest showed no traces of illegal drugs in Winehouse's system -- but more details emerged about her losing battle with alcohol. Winehouse's physician, Dr. Christina Romete, said she saw Winehouse at 7 p.m. the day before she died, when the singer was tipsy but still able to hold a conversation. Asked when she was going to stop drinking, Winehouse replied that she would call Romete over the weekend to discuss it, the physician said. Winehouse was determined to do things her own way, including therapy, Romete said, but was aware of the risks of alcohol abuse. The singer's personal security guard, Andrew Morris, said he last spoke to her at 2 a.m. on July 23. He said he looked in on her at 10 a.m. and saw her lying on her bed, but figured she was sleeping in, which wasn't unusual, the court heard. Morris said he realized something was wrong when he checked in again at 3 p.m. and saw Winehouse had not moved. She wasn't breathing and had no pulse, he said. Morris said the singer didn't ""drink to get drunk,"" but that he noticed she had started drinking alcohol again that week. Police who searched the flat after her death found three empty vodka bottles, the inquest heard. The pathologist's tests revealed that Winehouse's blood-alcohol level was 416 milligrams per 100 milliliters of blood. The level considered lethal is 350 milligrams per 100 milliliters of blood, and the legal limit to drive in Britain is 80 milligrams of alcohol. The pathologist found no traces of tablets in Winehouse's stomach and said her organs appeared to be normal. The verdict of misadventure means that it is judged to be an accidental death in which no law was broken or criminal negligence involved. A family statement, given by spokesman Chris Goodman, said: ""It is (with) some relief we finally found out what happened to Amy. ""We understand there was alcohol in her system when she passed away. It is likely a buildup of alcohol in her system over a number of days. ""The court heard that Amy was battling hard to conquer her problems with alcohol and it is a source of great pain that she could not win in time. She had started drinking again that week after a period of abstinence,"" Goodman said. Winehouse's father Mitch and mother Janet were among those who packed the small courtroom at St. Pancras Coroners Court to hear the evidence from key witnesses. Her family set up the Amy Winehouse Foundation last month to raise money to help young people in Britain and elsewhere, especially those suffering the effects of ill health, disability, poverty and addiction. Goodman said the ruling ""underlines how important our work with the Amy Winehouse Foundation is to us to help as many young people and children we can in her name."" Winehouse's family said in August that toxicology tests had found that ""no illegal substances"" were in her system at the time of her death but alcohol was present. The singer's soulful, throaty vocals brought her stardom in 2007, but her troubled off-stage life -- chronicled in her top 10 hit ""Rehab"" -- won her notoriety. Her death came less than two months after her latest release from a rehabilitation program and weeks after she was booed offstage by disappointed fans in Serbia. The tattooed London-born singer-songwriter's first album, ""Frank,"" debuted in 2003, when she was 19. International success came with her 2007 album ""Back to Black."" She dominated the 2008 Grammys, winning five awards that night and delivering, via satellite from London, a strong performance of ""Rehab."" Mitch Winehouse has said he plans to write a memoir, called ""Amy: My Daughter,"" to be released next summer, which he said would tell the story of the Amy that the public never got to know.","Three empty vodka bottles were found in Winehouse's home, the inquest hears .

"(CNN) -- Civilians are in hiding in the Yemeni capital as protesters and government forces struggle for control on the streets of Sanaa. Residents in Sanaa are stranded in their homes, and some even fear looking out of their windows as they are left to wonder how long the violence will rage around them. ""We can't leave our houses to get food for our children. As soon as we walk on the street we are shot,"" says Rami al-Shaibani, a Sanaa resident. Thousands protested in Sanaa's Change Square last week, but this week the square has been quiet, except for groups of youths carrying away the dead and helping the injured. Multiple witnesses and medics said dozens were killed in a violent government crackdown that started on Sunday. Protesters have used Change Square for a seven-month sit-in demanding the resignation of President Ali Abdullah Saleh. He is recuperating in Saudi Arabia from a attack in June on his palace but has vowed to return to Yemen to finish his term. Each wounded protester was carried by six or seven others -- sometimes friends of the casualty -- and taken to the medical camp in the square. Drops of blood created trails on the ground tracing the long, bloody route to a field hospital. At the medical camp, hundreds of young people were covered in blood and screaming from pain. Thousands more volunteered and donated blood for those in need. It seemed that not a minute passed without another injured youth entering the medical camp. The International Committee of the Red Cross has called for calm in Yemen, which, it said, is facing an ""unprecedented level of violence."" With the limited-capacity field hospital full of patients, doctors made a desperate call for volunteers to try to help save the injured. Dozens were killed and more than 700 were wounded -- many of them by gunshots -- over the last three days in clashes with the military, according to medical staff in Change Square. Eyewitnesses said they had seen snipers on the rooftops of buildings surrounding the square firing almost continuously. In one incident, an ambulance carrying three injured protesters flipped over when a rocket propelled grenade hit it, killing all five on board, the medical staff added. Abdul Rahman Barman, the executive director of a local human rights organization, said Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh's regime is attacking with no limits and does not differentiate between civilians, protesters or gunmen. The Yemeni government has repeatedly denied accusations of excessive use of force, and said the government is committed to establishing a peaceful transfer of power. Yemeni officials have said forces cracked down on those committing acts of violence during protests. Vice President Abdu Rabu Hadi has called for a cease-fire from all sides, state-run Saba news agency reported.","Dozens in capital Sanaa have been killed in a government crackdown since Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Color is coming to the Kindle. At least that's what the tech blogosphere expects to happen on Wednesday at an Amazon press conference. The maker of the world's most popular e-book reader is rumored to be announcing a color, touch-screen tablet device called the ""Kindle Fire,"" according to the blog TechCrunch, which claims to have seen the gadget. Here are the Kindle Fire's specs, according to that site and others: . -- 7-inch color screen, compared to 6-inch for current Kindles . -- Wi-Fi only (no 3G version) -- Touch-screen navigation . -- Glowing LED screen instead of paper-like e-ink . -- Android operating system . -- Hits stores in November . -- Current Kindle will remain on sale . The Kindle tablet is remarkably similar to BlackBerry's PlayBook tablet, says Ryan Block at the blog GDGT, and that's because both were built and designed by the same manufacturing company. Block, who cites unnamed sources, says Amazon used the design for the unpopular BlackBerry tablet as a starting point. Even though details about the device haven't been confirmed, Block and other bloggers are already throwing water on the Kindle Fire. ""Although Amazon did refresh the ID of their PlayBook derivative, I'm told that this first tablet of theirs is 'supposed to be pretty poor' and is a 'stopgap' in order to get a tablet out the door for the 2011 holiday season -- which doesn't exactly leave the best taste in my mouth,"" he writes. ""But it's also not the most uncommon story, either: when you're breaking into a new market, sometimes you have to do whatever it takes to get in the game. You may remember how crappy the original Kindle was compared to later models!"" Three major magazine companies have signed on to provide content for the new Kindle tablet, according to Peter Kafka at the blog network AllThingsD, which is owned by the Wall Street Journal. Hearst, Conde Nast and Meredith will sell digital versions of their magazines on the upcoming Kindle tablet; but Time Inc., which shares a parent company with CNN, will not settle on a deal this week, Kafka says. All of this is just conjecture for now, of course. Amazon's press conference is scheduled for 10 a.m. Wednesday in New York. Many details should become clearer then. Barnes & Noble, one of Amazon's competitors in e-books, is expected to announce a new version of its Nook color e-reader later this year.","TechCrunch: Amazon's touch-screen tablet will be called 'Kindle Fire'

"(CNN) -- Pink Floyd are not who you think they are. With effects-laden production, Hipgnosis-illustrated concept albums and expansive live shows, the band is famously associated with rock 'n' roll excess. It wasn't for nothing that the Sex Pistols' John Lydon scrawled ""I HATE"" on a Pink Floyd T-shirt (though he later admitted he loved the band). But, almost 45 years on, a closer look at the band's catalog reveals as much hardcore pile-driving (""Run Like Hell"") and wistful melodies (""Wish You Were Here"") as the long-form ""Interstellar Overdrive"" space rock with which it's frequently classified. Still, drummer Nick Mason says, it's hard to escape the pigeonholing. ""I think these labels are generally delivered by people who sometimes haven't listened to the music,"" he said in a phone interview. Longtime fans and new listeners will have another chance to size up Mason's words. The band's entire studio catalog, including the Syd Barrett-led 1967 debut ""The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,"" the Roger Waters-dominated ""The Wall"" (1979) and the career-concluding ""The Division Bell"" (1994), has been remastered and is scheduled for release on Tuesday. ""The Dark Side of the Moon,"" the band's 1973 classic, which still holds the record for longest run on the Billboard album charts, will be issued in three versions: a single CD, a two-disc ""Experience Edition"" that includes a live album, and a six-disc ""Immersion Edition"" boxed set. Mason talked to CNN about the band's evolution, the pitfalls of playing live and fantasies about being the Monkees. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: How often do you go back and listen to the old material? Mason: The answer is, I would never willingly put on one of our old records at home for entertainment. But with this project, that all changed -- and I was forced at gunpoint to listen to everything, again and again. (laughs) Actually, it's really interesting. It's a bit like a diary -- looking at old photographs. What you get is not only the music but the memories that come with it of what you were doing, and how it was in the studio, and all the rest of it. CNN: There's been the label placed on Floyd as ""space rock."" How did you guys take that label? Mason: One tends to try and reject any labeling anyway, as a matter of principle. And I think the labels tend to reflect whatever you were doing before. So we were labeled psychedelic -- well, ""Dark Side of the Moon"" was the least psychedelic album you could hope to listen to. It's terribly specific and measured and not floaty-off anywhere. I think these labels are generally delivered by people who sometimes haven't listened to the music -- sometimes by just looking at the photographs. If the band have got curly hair and flared trousers, then they're prog-rock or space rock, and if they're very, very grubby, with waistcoats and jeans, then they're an R&B band. CNN: Also, it probably has something to do with what you were smoking or doing when you were listening to the album. Mason: Yeah. Always be very careful if you're listening to country and western and doing drugs. CNN: Let's talk about ""Dark Side."" Were you aware that you were creating something different? Mason: I don't think so. My opinion was that we knew we'd done the best thing so far. But as I've told people, even if you think you've done the world's greatest record, that does not guarantee that the public will feel the same way. What happened with ""Dark Side"" was we were out touring with it and it began to come up the American charts, but we were actually on tour, so there wasn't that time to reflect and bask in the glory of being No. 1. It was much more, ""Where are we tomorrow? Dallas. OK."" We were slightly disjointed from its success. What the success really bought for us was the thing of moving up a notch. You suddenly go from playing theaters to playing arenas. And in some cases, arenas into stadiums. So that's the way things catch up with you. Sometimes they catch you out. If you're used to playing smaller venues, and you suddenly find yourself in a stadium, it's not necessarily the best place to be working. CNN: After that, you guys did play a lot of stadiums. That led to a lot of discord. Was there a time when you thought, I wish I could go back to the clubs? Mason: No. I don't think there was a wish to go back. But I think stadiums make quite a lot of bands feel a little uneasy. There is that sense that you're not really connecting with the audience as well as you would. I think arenas are fine -- I think arenas are really suited for rock concerts. But stadiums, it gets away from you a bit. There's too many people at the back not listening. CNN: How did the band change for you over the years as leadership went from Syd to Roger to David Gilmour? Mason: I've always been happy with the way it operates. I have no wish to be the fearless leader. And interestingly, I think even David found it pretty wearing when he was sort of in command on the last couple of tours. It's not always easy being the chief. I've always felt that I have my say and I am a partner in it, rather than an employee. CNN: What do you think are some of the underrated aspects of the band? Mason: To be honest, after this long and this many releases, there's not much that's been overlooked. I was telling someone yesterday, I feel like a stately home with people taking tours around me. CNN: How are you guys getting along nowadays? Mason: Fine, I think. We haven't had any fights recently. David and I pitched up for Roger's show in London. And it was really nice -- we had dinner together. There's a lot of shared stuff as well as plenty of aggro. The fact of the matter is you grow up together. The problem is when you start in a band you think it's all going to be like the Monkees -- four lovable moptops running around at double speed. But then you get married and have children, and being rock and roll often the marriages break up. People change as they grow. CNN: And here you are still with people you knew at 18. Mason: Yes, it's very unsatisfactory. (chuckles) CNN: Do you feel like sitting in with an R&B band some night? Mason: Yeah. I still really like playing music, and playing with other people is terrific. I was talking with someone about a charity record we did a year or so ago, and the rhythm track was Bill Wyman playing bass and me playing drums. I've known Bill for 35 years or something, and it was great to finally end up playing together. It's always a little bit nerve-wracking -- you're always alarmed at the prospect of f***ing up -- and if you get through it, and someone says, ""It's good,"" it's a very warming feeling.","Pink Floyd's entire studio catalog has been remastered .

"Washington (CNN) -- Law enforcement officers arrested 22 people Friday in Orlando and Tampa, Florida, as part of an effort to shut down so-called pill mills distributing illegal prescription drugs. Those arrested include five doctors and two pharmacists, federal officials said. Attorney General Eric Holder said the latest busts send ""a clear message that in Florida, which has long been an epicenter for the illegal use and distribution of prescription drugs, the days of easily acquiring these drugs from corrupt doctors and pharmacists are numbered."" The arrests were made as part of Operation Pill Nation II. Drug Enforcement Agency Administrator Michele Leonhart said the operation is part of a strategy to end ""Florida's role as an epicenter for rogue pain clinics in the United States."" In addition to Friday's arrests, federal and local law enforcement officers also executed six search warrants in the Tampa area and served orders to a doctor and a pharmacy, immediately revoking their authority to dispense or prescribe controlled substances such as pain medication, according to U.S. Attorney Robert O'Neill. Forty-nine other arrests were made earlier in the operation. Asked whether the crackdown could hamper the ability of people with legitimate needs for pain medicine to get it, Leonhart said, ""a legitimate patient going to a legitimate doctor has no problem."" Leonhart noted the ease of distinguishing real caregivers from pill mills, which run a ""cash and carry"" business and do not examine patients before prescribing drugs. Operation Pill Nation I began in South Florida in February. Forty-seven people have been arrested so far in the region, including 17 doctors and five clinic owners, according to federal officials. Seventy doctors and six pharmacies there have lost their ability to dispense controlled substances. In addition, more than $18.9 million in cash and other assets have been seized. Friday's arrests come as the DEA prepares to hold its third Prescription Drug Take Back on Saturday as part of its nationwide efforts to stop the abuse of prescription drugs. Five thousand DEA collection sites will be sprinkled around the country where people can dispose of drugs that may have expired or are unwanted. The DEA said two earlier collection drives brought in more than 309 tons of drugs.","Five doctors and two pharmacists are among those arrested .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- An English tourist kidnapped from a remote Kenyan resort is being held by Somali pirates in a remote corner of the lawless country, according to experts and security analysts in Nairobi. ""Gangs from Southern Somalia took her up the coast and then moved her several times,"" said Andrew Mwangura, a piracy expert and maritime editor of Somalia Report, an independent online publication. Judith Tebbutt was abducted by armed men from a remote safari lodge near to the Somali border earlier this month. Her husband, David Tebbutt, was killed in the attack when he resisted, according to Kenyan police. Details of the incident are still sketchy and the British government has asked journalists not to reveal the exact location of Tebbutt to avoid abduction attempts from rival gangs. Initially, it was feared that al-Shabaab, the al Qaeda-linked militant group, had conducted the operation as a revenge attack against the British nationals. But a security analyst based in Nairobi, who tracks piracy operations but is not authorized to speak to the media, also believes this is the work of pirates. ""This is not the work of al-Shabaab,"" he said, ""this is the work of Southern armed gangs and pirates."" No ransom demands have been made yet, says Mwangura. But if Somali pirates carried out the operation, it represents a marked departure in tactics. For years, pirates have attacked commercial ships in the busy shipping lanes between Europe and Asia. A cargo ship has insurance, and after months of negotiations pirates can often clear several million U.S. dollars. Some analysts believe that Somali pirates are now moving onto land because it's getting harder out at sea. ""Their inability to operate freely in the their waters is forcing them onto land,"" says Andrews Atta-Asamoah, a senior researcher at the Institute for Security Studies. ""It's significant if you place it in the context of the struggle against piracy. Since the whole push against piracy by international navies, the pirates have been looking for new territory and new frontiers."" Atta-Asamoah says that Kenya is a natural target because if its porous border with Somalia and a high number of foreign visitors and workers. The Kenyan government, prompted by their reliance on tourism for foreign exchange, says they are making every effort to secure the border with Somalia. Others say that, rather than a trend, this is a one-time attack caused by a more prosaic fact: the weather. Monsoon rains off the coast of Somalia at this time of year makes operating offshore difficult. ""This incident is a special case,"" says Mwangura.","Judith Tebbutt was taken from a Kenyan lodge earlier this month .

"(CNN) -- Orlando's police chief on Monday named a Florida man as the ""primary suspect"" in the case of the man's missing ex-fiancee, who hasn't been seen since the two appeared on an episode of ""The People's Court."" Police Chief Paul Rooney identified Dale Smith Jr., who relatives say is the father of two of Michelle Parker's children, as the lone suspect in the case. ""We had to look at every aspect of the case before we could come out publicly and state that Mr. Smith is our primary focus,"" Rooney said at a news conference. ""We will not rest until Michelle is found."" Although Rooney publicly identified Smith in the case, no charges have been filed. The woman was last seen driving near Orlando on November 17, shortly after ""The People's Court"" segment that had been taped months earlier aired. Her last known communication was a brief, seemingly innocuous text message to her brother that same day, according to the official Facebook page devoted to her case. Attempts to reach Smith by phone -- at numbers believed to be his and that of his parents -- and social media -- via Facebook e-mail, on a profile believed to be his -- for comment on Monday's developments and the case generally have thus far been unsuccessful.‬‪ ‬‪ . He has refused authorities' offer to take a polygraph test in the case, Rooney told reporters. Parker's mother, Yvonne Stewart, said in Monday's news conference that the naming of Smith as a suspect is ""huge."" She urged him to come forward more earnestly, in hopes that his information will lead to her daughter. ""This is a sad day, really, but I think it was inevitable,"" Stewart said. ""(Michelle is) so beautiful, she doesn't deserve this."" Rooney acknowledged that authorities recently searched Smith's parents' house, though he didn't ""want to go into evidence that we seized or didn't seize."" Parker's black Hummer SUV was found a day after she was last seen, according to the Facebook page. She is described as white, 33 years old, roughly 5 feet 5 inches tall with short dark brown hair. Her sister, Lauren Erickson, earlier told HLN's Nancy Grace that her sister and Smith met about five years ago. They were estranged, and ""The People's Court"" episode revolved around their dispute over who'd get a $5,000 engagement ring, with Judge Marilyn Milian eventually suggesting they split the proceeds and stay apart from one another. Erickson said that her sister was devoted to her children, whom she, her mother and the rest of the family have not seen since Parker's disappearance. ""She would never do anything to leave them. They are her world,"" Erickson said. ""They`re the reason that she was working two jobs and going to school full time -- so that she could give them a better life."" On Monday night, brother Dustin Erickson told HLN's Vinnie Politan that for all the talk about Smith, his main focus is on his sister. He and other family members urged people to continue distributing fliers, spreading the word about Parker and looking for her at every opportunity. ""My biggest thing is that I still need to search for my sister,"" Dustin Erickson said. ""She is still missing and I still need to find her.""","Dale Smith Jr. is a suspect in Michelle Parker's disappearance, a police chief says .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's mother says she's hoping Dr. Conrad Murray will get the harshest sentence possible, four years in a state prison, in the death of her son. ""I don't believe that he intended for Michael to die,"" Katherine Jackson told CNN Monday. ""He was just taking a chance."" A jury found Murray guilty of involuntary manslaughter three weeks ago, and Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor set Tuesday for his sentencing. Pastor, who sent Murray directly to jail after he was convicted this month, has a choice ranging between probation and up to four years in a state prison. But measures to relieve California prison and jail crowding could significantly shorten his time locked up. Prosecutors successfully argued that Murray's reckless use of the surgical anesthetic propofol to help Jackson sleep, without proper monitoring equipment, led to the pop icon's death. Testimony during his trial revealed that Murray gave propofol nearly every night in the two months before the singer's death on June 25, 2009, as Jackson prepared for his comeback concerts set for London the next month. Katherine Jackson and several of her children will be in court for the sentencing Tuesday, but her grandchildren Prince, Paris and Blanket will not. They'll be at school, she said. She was uncertain whether anyone from the family would speak in court, but she was interviewed by a probation officer who will include her thoughts in the report to the judge, Jackson said. Murray's elderly mother, Milta Rush, wrote a letter to the judge asking for mercy, saying ""his compassion and his soft heartedness for others led to this dilemma."" Prosecutors are asking for the maximum four years behind bars, and they want Murray to pay Jackson's children more than $100 million in restitution. Defense lawyers want probation, not prison time. Each side will have a chance to present oral arguments Tuesday, but their positions were detailed in sentencing memos filed with the judge last week. Murray has ""displayed a complete lack of remorse"" about Jackson's death, and is, ""even worse, failing to accept even the slightest level of responsibility,"" deputy district attorneys David Walgren and Deborah Brazil wrote. The prosecutors cited Murray's decision not to testify in his own defense, even while he was giving interviews for a documentary that aired days after the verdict. ""In each of these interviews, the defendant has very clearly stated that he bears no responsibility for Michael Jackson's death,"" the prosecutors said. ""Moreover, the defendant has continued to express concern only for his individual plight and portrays himself, not the decedent, as the victim."" ""I don't feel guilty because I did not do anything wrong,"" Murray said in the documentary quoted by the prosecution. ""Finally, the defendant consistently blames the victim for his own death, even going so far as to characterize himself as being 'entrapped' by the victim and as someone who suffered a 'betrayal' at the hands of the victim,"" the prosecutors said. Jackson's death came as he was preparing for a series of comeback concerts in London, which the defense argued pressured the singer to seek sleep or risk having the concerts canceled. The prosecutors contend in their sentencing memo that Murray should be ordered to pay Jackson's three children restitution for the subsequent ""wage and profits lost,"" as provided under California's ""victim's bill of rights"" law. The singer's ""estate estimates Michael Jackson's projected earnings for the 50-show O2 concert series to be $100,000,000,"" the prosecutors said. With nearly $2 million in funeral expenses and 10% interest added each year, the prosecution is asking Pastor to order Murray to pay Prince, Paris and Blanket Jackson more than $120 million in restitution. While it is doubtful that Murray, who is unlikely to ever practice medicine again, could pay much of that sum, it could prevent him from reaping financial benefits from any books, interviews or film projects in the future. Defense lawyers, in their sentencing memo, said Murray is suffering ""manifold collateral consequences"" because of the felony conviction. The memo included a biography of Murray that described him as ""a self-made man of humble origins,"" who paid his own way through medical school without scholarships or family funds. ""He was raised in a home that lacked indoor plumbing or electricity, and he walked to school barefoot for his first couple years of school,"" the defense said. He worked as a doctor for 20 years, with ""no prior contacts with the law,"" and many of his patients were elderly in low-income, underserved communities, the defense said. ""It seems reasonable that the transgression for which he is to be judged should be viewed within the context of the larger life of which it is a part,"" it said. The defense challenges the prosecution's contention that Murray is not remorseful. ""Dr. Murray wishes to make it unmistakenly clear to everyone that he deeply mourns the loss of Michael Jackson's life, and he profoundly regrets any mistakes or oversights on his part that may have contributed to it,"" the defense said. The judge should also consider ""the manifold collateral consequences that Dr. Murray has sustained as a result of his mistake,"" the defense said, including the loss of his medical career, the public disgrace and loss of privacy. ""Dr. Murray has been described as a changed, grief-stricken man, who walks around under a pall of sadness since the loss of his patient, Mr. Jackson,"" the defense said. The defense memo included a letter from Murray's elderly mother, Milta Rush. She sat in court for much of her son's trial, just a few feet away from Jackson's mother. ""I sympathize with Mrs. Jackson as a mother,"" Rush wrote in a letter to the judge. ""I sense she was very close to her son. I really wanted to approach her personally and tell her I am sorry for the loss of her son, but I was unsure if she would be receptive, and I did not want to take the chance of violating court rules. I am sorry for all her loss."" While Murray's mother told the judge her son is ""saddened and remorseful"" about Jackson's death, she said ""his compassion and his soft heartedness for others led to this dilemma."" The defense contends that Murray was trying to help Jackson, who was desperate for sleep so he could be ready for rehearsals. ""His compassionate intentions should not be overlooked,"" it said. ""The victim was a willing recipient of the medications administered,"" the defense said. ""In fact, Mr. Jackson had repeatedly begged Dr. Murray for propofol to overcome his insomnia so that he could sleep."" Murray does not pose a safety threat to the public, it said. ""The likelihood of recurrence is essentially nonexistent since Conrad Murray's medical license has been suspended."" Aside from the arguments of what Murray deserves, the defense contends that California's prison and jail crowding mean that ""neither the space nor the public funds exist to continue imprisoning nonviolent, nondangerous offenders who do not need to be incapacitated for the sake of public safety."" ""Dr. Murray is clearly such a defendant,"" the defense said. ""He is an individual who remained free on bond for more than two years prior to the jury verdict, adhering assiduously to all of the bond conditions that had been imposed.""

"(CNN) -- Egypt is on the roller-coaster of transition. It's a bumpy and hair-raising ride to a destination unknown. But the country is moving. And in that, there's hope. In Tahrir Square last Friday, I was struck by the carnival atmosphere: Vendors sold candied apples and baked yams; young boys hawked red, white and-black hats and flags; a crowd gathered to watch cartoonists chalk an oversized military general dressed as Santa Claus. Activists of all political shades shouted poetry and enthusiastic speeches, leading crowds in chanting: ""The people want the end of the military regime!"" ""The people want a civilian regime!"" ""We are all one!"" But by Saturday, Tahrir Square had become a battleground. Crowds shrunk to die-hards throwing stones and Molotov cocktails, while security forces volleyed tear gas and rubber bullets. From the 18th floor of the locked-down Intercontinental hotel (a barrage of tear gas having abruptly aborted my attempt to speak to those at the edges of the square), I watched as the square cleared out, battles moved to side streets, and then the atmosphere turned quiet. Briefly. Demonstrators regrouped. Political leaders across the spectrum aired televised condemnation of the police and support for the protesters. And people started streaming again through the streets, across a nearby bridge, and back into the square. It was a sight reminiscent of the nail-biting days of January. With such off-and-on violence, and rising numbers of dead and injured, some may wonder if democracy is worth it -- or even possible. Many Egyptians are no longer as beamingly optimistic as they were last spring. Then, they dreamed of blooming democracy and booming economies. Today, they want stability. Tourism has slowed to a trickle, and taxi drivers, hotel workers and souvenir vendors shake their heads at the demonstrators. Capital is fleeing, and foreign reserves drying up. As people speak their minds, many others -- from liberals to conservatives â€” feel uneasy. Large numbers of bearded men and covered women, demanding a regime based on Sharia law, frighten Christians and Muslims alike. Clashes between Coptic Christians and Muslims create fear that religious strife will rend Egypt's multireligious society. And women especially worry that their freedoms are at stake. Liberals, far less numerous, can also be intimidating. Many in Egypt believe they do not understand or accept ""real"" Egyptian society and threaten to corrupt it. Last month, a female blogger posted nude pictures of herself and others in a sensational appeal to expand freedom of expression. It led many to complain that too much freedom would corrupt Egyptian society. Anger against America and Israel also worry many. A 20-something Egyptian, working for a foreign corporation in Egypt, pulled me aside in Tahrir Square to explain that former President Hosni Mubarak had known where to draw the line. These people, he exclaimed, gesturing to those around him, don't understand the hadud, or limits. Like others, he said he worries they would trade Egypt's welfare for the Palestinians' cause. But even amid conflict and uncertainty, there's hope. Egyptians who desperately want to escape from nearly 60 years of military-backed authoritarian rule have what it takes to do so. Egyptian nationalism is strong. Airwaves are filled with nationalist songs, and Egyptian flags abound. Friday's calls to end the military regime mingled with expressions of nationalism. Huge crowds chanted in unison: ""Christians and Muslims, we're all Egyptians, we are all one,"" and, most directly, ""Ana Masri!"" (""I am Egyptian!"") There is also strong respect for elections. At Tahrir Square, parties and candidates took advantage of the gathering to distribute pamphlets and urge demonstrators to vote for pro-revolutionary forces. And even with the descent into violence, forces across the political spectrum have urged elections to begin as scheduled. Debates are intense. Egyptians in the square hotly contested the nature of the Egyptian military and goals for the future. The Salafi Hizb al-Nur (""Party of Light"") called for a regime based on Sharia law; the Popular Front appealed to secular nationalism; and the Muslim Brotherhood demanded a civilian, democratic regime with respect and freedoms for all. As one in Friday's crowd argued, many Egyptians may need to develop respect for diverging opinions. Yet this is true in many nascent democracies. Political forces also are well-organized. The Muslim Brothers not only can bring people onto the streets, but also send them home when the time is right. They were critical in rallying crowds last week, where they maintained a space for women to avoid being crushed and jostled by men and a pathway for demonstrators to navigate the crowd. And they were instrumental in returning crowds to Tahrir late Saturday night. Other forces, too, are gaining strength. In fact, Tuesday's crowds -- despite the Brothers' refusal to participate in the demonstrations -- show that others, too, can mobilize forces. With a strong sense of nationalism, hotly contested debates, a belief in electoral democracy and organized political forces, Egypt has what it takes to form democracy. It just won't be easy or fast. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ellen Lust.","Ellen Lust: Egypt in bumpy transition; daily Tahrir Square goes from festive to combative .

"(CNN) -- He has met the United States' former First Lady, and an audience with Barack Obama awaits, but the American that world champion boxer Amir Khan really wants to face next is proving a bit more elusive. The British fighter has set his heart on becoming the planet's best pound-for-pound pugilist, and for him that means taking on the undefeated Floyd Mayweather Jr. -- who, as a five-division champion, once laid claim to that coveted crown. Khan, 24, unified the WBA super and IBF light welterweight world championship belts in July by defeating American Zab Judah in Las Vegas in July, while Mayweather recently returned to the ring after a 16-month absence. Six-time world champion Mayweather has won all of his 42 fights as a professional, 26 by knockout, and emerged victorious from a controversial contest with Victor Ortiz on September 18. But the fight many boxing fans want to see is Mayweather against eight-division champion Manny Pacquiao -- the Filipino rated by Ring Magazine as the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world. ""Floyd Mayweather pound for pound is probably one of the best fighters in the world,"" Khan, who won an Olympic silver medal in the lightweight category at the Athens Games in 2004, told CNN. ""Me and Manny both want to fight him, but that will never happen because at the moment he doesn't want to fight either of us. But it will come to a stage when the pressure will be so much on Floyd Mayweather that he'll have to take the fight."" Khan doubts that a match-up between his Golden Boy stablemate Mayweather and Top Rank's Pacquiao will ever happen, with disagreements over drug-testing and money having previously prevented the fight. ""You've got two different promotion teams, and for them to agree on terms for a fight is very difficult,"" he said. ""Firstly, you've got Mayweather saying that Manny has to take so many drug tests and blood tests, then Manny talking about the purse. But that fight will generate about $100 million each, so it's a lot of money to say no to."" Mayweather, 34, and Pacquiao, 32, have both occupied the position of best pound-for-pound boxer in the world, and Khan is aiming to emulate the success enjoyed by the decorated duo. ""I want to be known as a legend in the sport and I want to win everything. I want to be a pound-for-pound champion of the world, and every morning when I wake up that's what drives me to the gym to train hard,"" he said. ""When I'm tired in the gym, that's what pushes me, because I want to be the best there is. And, I'm nearly there. I'm only 24, I'm the unified champion, I'm a two-time world champion, and I've done it so young. But I want to achieve more."" Khan has seen his international profile increase in the last 18 months, having fought in the U.S. on three occasions since making his American bow against Paulie Malignaggi at New York's Madison Square Gardens in March 2010. It would now appear even politicians are starting to sit up and take notice of the Bolton-born fighter, with Khan having recently met U.S. Secretary of State Hilary Clinton and now being lined up for an audience with President Barack Obama later this year. ""I was invited to go to the state building,"" said Khan. ""Hilary Clinton invited me and my team. It was an honor to be part of that event. It was about the Muslim sportsmen who were influential and who do good things in the Muslim community. ""I enjoyed it and they want me back over there in December probably to meet Obama, so it's good times. ""When they first got talking about it, I thought they were just pulling my leg, but they were quite serious about it, and I thought 'Wow'. I might never get the chance to go to the White House or meet Obama again, so I'm going to make the most of it.""","Boxing champion Amir Khan tells CNN he wants to face Floyd Mayweather .

"Cairo (CNN) -- A pipeline that supplies gas from Egypt to Israel exploded Monday in the northern Sinai Peninsula near Bir el-Adb, an Egyptian security official said. The explosion appears to be an act of sabotage, said Gen. Saleh al-Masri, the head of security in Egypt's northern Sinai Peninsula. ""It is an act of sabotage, but the army and members of Egyptian Natural Gas Company are on the scene trying to understand what happened,"" al-Masri said. The explosion has shut off the flow of gas to Israel and Jordan, said Ayman Jahin, a general manager at the gas company. It is the third such attack on Egyptian pipeline infrastructure since the toppling of Hosni Mubarak's government earlier in the year. The first two attacks resulted in a halt in the flow of gas to Israel, which receives about 40% of its natural gas from Egypt. The army cordoned off the area around the explosion, asking onlookers to return home,"" Mohamed Sabry, a freelance journalist at the scene, told CNN. He said flames could be seen shooting into the sky hours after the explosion. Firefighters were working to contain the fire, he said. Delivery of Egyptian gas to Israel came to a halt after an April attack on a pipeline in the Sinai Peninsula. The flow of gas through the pipeline to Israel was restored in early June. In February, a gas pipeline in El Arish that sent natural gas to Jordan was set on fire, shutting off the flow of gas to not only Israel but but Syria, Jordan and Lebanon as well. The issue of gas sales to Israel has become highly controversial in Egypt with various allegations circulating that Israel received below market prices for the gas and that Egyptian government officials enriched themselves on the deal. The Israeli government and Israeli investors in the pipeline have categorically denied below market pricing for the gas and last month one of the major investors released a statement expressing public frustration that the Egyptian government was not moving more quickly to get the gas flowing again and threatened to pursue legal action. The pipeline between Egypt and Israel became operational in 2008 and the arrangement represents one of the major economic agreements between the two countries. CNN's Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report.","Flow of gas to Israel and Jordan from Egypt has been shut off .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak could be executed if he is convicted of ordering the killing of protesters, Egypt's justice minister says. ""One of the charges he is facing is complicity in the killing of martyrs and issuing the orders for premeditated the killing of those people,"" said Justice Minister Mohamed Abdelaziz al-Juindy. ""This is a charge with a harsh punishment -- the death penalty."" In his first television interview since taking office, the new justice minister said last week that Egyptian courts would not shy away from sentencing Mubarak to death if he is found guilty. ""If the crime is proven, then the court will not hesitate to issue the death sentence,"" he said. ""A judge may have mercy if there is a reason for that, but I don't think in this case there is any argument for clemency whatsoever,"" the minister added, calling it ""a horrible crime, to kill 800 citizens who were asking for their rights and hoping to topple a corrupt regime that caused the ruin of Egypt."" Mubarak resigned in the face of popular protests in February after more than 30 years in power. He has been in poor health and living in the southern Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh since then. Prosecutors last month shelved plans to move him to a military hospital in Cairo, saying Mubarak's doctors said the transfer could be life-threatening. Adel Saeed, the prosecutor's spokesman, said April 26 that the Interior Ministry made the decision after Mubarak's medical team submitted a report that determined he would be at risk if he were moved. But Justice Minister al-Juindy said Mubarak's health was ""good,"" according to reports he had received. Mubarak ""suffers some heart irregularities known as atrial fibrillation, but his pulse and pressure are fine. His heart rate is 65 per minute, which is considered like an athlete,"" the official said. ""Of course he's facing questioning for the first time in his life, so this is affecting him psychologically,"" the minister added. He will be required to appear in court when the time comes, al-Juindy said. ""His appearance in court will be mandatory,"" he said. If Mubarak is too sick to appear, ""in this case, the prosecutor visits him, and this is a procedure we follow with any sick suspect. The suspect must be given a chance to put forward his defense, so that the trial can be fair."" He is also being probed on allegations of corruption and misuse of state funds. ""There are reports that the former president's wealth is in the billions, and indeed it is billions,"" the justice minister asserted. So far ""we can't ascertain the exact amount, but the investigation is underway,"" he said. Mubarak's trial will show that the rule of law is supreme in the country, al-Juindy said. ""The law is respected in Egypt and is applied on everyone without any exception,"" he said. ""This is very important because Egypt now has become a country were the law is sovereign.""","Egypt's former president is accused of ordering protesters shot .

"(CNN) -- For nearly 30 years, one man has dominated Egypt. Hosni Mubarak, 82, has survived would-be assassins and ill health, crushed a rising Islamist radical movement and maintained the peace with neighboring Israel that got his predecessor killed. His government's continued observance of the Camp David accords with Israel is the cornerstone of what peace has been achieved in the decades-long Arab-Israeli conflict. Following the revolt that toppled Tunisia's longtime strongman, demonstrators in the streets of Cairo are standing up to riot police and chanting, ""Mubarak, Saudi Arabia is waiting for you."" Experienced observers say it's the most most significant challenge to his rule yet. It's far from clear, however, that the demonstrators have the support or the coordination to bring down the man critics have called Egypt's last pharaoh. ""He's been in power a very long time, and he is very wily,"" said Juan Cole, a Middle East historian at the University of Michigan. ""He's developed all kinds of techiniques for dealing with opponents that have proven relatively successful."" But longtime observers of the region say the stability Mubarak has purchased has come at the cost of entrenched poverty and repression in the Arab world's most populous nation. ""Egypt is a broken country,"" Fawaz Gerges, a professor of Middle Eastern relations at the London School of Economics, told CNN. ""It used to be the jewel of the Middle East. It's the capital of its cultural production."" But now, Gerges said, ""Egyptians have no outlets. They don't feel that they have a sense of hope for the future."" Mubarak was a Soviet-trained pilot who was chief of staff of Egypt's air force during the 1973 Mideast war. The early success of Egyptian pilots against Israel made him a national hero, and then-President Anwar Sadat made him vice president in 1975. Six years later, Sadat died in a hail of gunfire at a military parade, killed by Islamic militants from within the army's own ranks after he took the dramatic step of making peace with Israel. Upon assuming office, one of Mubarak's first acts was to declare a state of emergency that allowed barred unauthorized assembly, restricted freedom of speech and allowed police to jail people indefinitely. He has made extensive use of those powers in the ensuing decades. The Egyptian army put down riots by disgruntled police officers in 1986, and he threw an estimated 30,000 people in jail when jihadists carried out a string of attacks on tourists. ""He pretty much wiped them out,"" Cole said. ""It's not an accident that they were in Afghanistan instead of Egypt."" And the government has also penetrated opposition movements so thoroughly that ""If five people sit down to plot something, the fifth person writes a report to Hosni Mubarak about it,"" he said. The result is ""a regime that has very little legitimacy, but presents itself as something there's no point in trying to change,"" said Nathan Brown, a professor of Middle Eastern politics at George Washington University in Washington. But Brown said the January 14 overthrow of Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, who fled to Saudi Arabia after 23 years in power, has changed the thinking of many in the region. ""I think what the events in Tunisia did was take that sense that nothing could ever change and lead a few people to question it,"" he said. Mubarak has headed off a similar movement before, in 2005, when Egyptians mounted large-scale protests to demand fundamental and widespread reform. He intimidated the leaders of the officially banned but tolerated Muslim Brotherhood, harassed middle-class demonstrators and managed to pick off the leadership of those protests, Brown said. But the current movement ""has no real leadership, so it can't be decapitated the same way,"" he said. ""If Mubarak decided tomorrow, 'I'll sit down and engage with you,' it's not clear who that 'you' is."" Mubarak won four terms as president in elections that were considered formalities. His fifth, in 2005, was Egypt's first multi-party presidential vote, but it was widely criticized as a ""sham,"" Cole said. Meanwhile, the country's economy stagnated for the first 20 years of his rule. Development has picked up in the past decade, fueled by a move away from state control and by billions in tourist dollars, but its gains have been ""very unevenly distributed."" About 40 percent of Egyptians currently live in poverty, Gerges said. The aging autocrat has escaped at least two assassination attempts, including a close call in 1995 when Islamic militants opened fire on his motorcade at a pan-African conference in Ethiopia. And in recent years, he has had several bouts of illness but has never picked a vice president. He is widely believed to have anointed his son Gamal as his successor, but no formal announcement has been made. In 2003, he collapsed while delivering a televised speech to the Egyptian parliament -- returning later to blame his illness on the flu. He had back surgery in Germany in 2004, returning in 2010 to have his gall bladder removed. He has largely withdrawn from public view in recent years and has not addressed his country during the current crisis, Brown said. His situation is being closely watched overseas, particularly in the United States. In the past decade, Egypt has been major player in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, and it contributed troops to the U.S.-led coalition that drove Iraq out of Kuwait in 1991. It gets about $1.3 billion in military aid from Washington every year, second only to Israel, and has received nearly $30 billion in economic aid since 1975, according to State Department figures. But it opposed the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 -- and while sticking with Camp David, Egypt's ties with Israel amount to a ""cold peace,"" Cole said. President Barack Obama noted Thursday that Mubarak has been ""very helpful on a range of tough issues,"" but he said he has pushed the Egyptian leader to take steps toward reform. ""You can see these pent-up frustrations that are being displayed on the streets,"" Obama said. He urged the Egyptian government to avoid resorting to violence to put down the demonstrations, adding, ""I think it's very important that people have mechanisms in order to express legitimate grievances."" Brown said Mubarak probably has to endorse some political form to survive. But he will have to do it ""extremely carefully, so it's not seen as a desperate measure of last resort."" Cole said Mubarak could bow to one of the protesters' demands and lift the state of emergency. ""Egypt does have a fairly liberal constitution and it does enshrine a lot of rights in it,"" he said. ""But it's just a piece of paper. It's sidestepped by the emergency."" If lifted, ""The judges and the courts in Egypt are very feisty, and they will take on the government."" He could also hold a free and fair presidential election this year, ""but it's asking a lot,"" Cole said. But Gerges said the Middle East has seen ""the barrier of fear"" removed since the events in Tunisia. ""Arabs really no longer feel terrified of the security apparatus, regardless of whether Mubarak remains or goes,"" he said. ""We're going to have a new era of politics.""","Hosni Mubarak has held power since 1981 .

"(CNN) -- Israel has issued a rare statement of ""regret"" for the recent deaths of several Egyptian security personnel, hours after Egypt said it was recalling its ambassador. Egypt's government posted a statement Saturday saying its ambassador would be withdrawn until Israel conducted an investigation into what it called ""indiscriminate shelling"" that led to the deaths of at least three security forces in its Sinai region on Thursday.  Later in the day, the statement was taken down without explanation. Top-level Israel security officials met Saturday with Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak, who quickly issued a statement vowing that Israel would conduct a military investigation, followed by a joint examination with the Egyptian military, of the incident. ""We regret the deaths of members of the Egyptian security forces during the terror attack on the Israeli-Egyptian border,"" Barak said. ""The Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty has great importance and much strategic value for the stability of the Middle East."" The tense situation between Israel and Egypt comes amid heightened tensions in the region following Israeli strikes in Gaza after a series of attacks in southern Israel on Thursday that targeted buses, cars and soldiers.  An Egyptian military official said Israeli forces may have been targeting militants near Egypt's border with Gaza when they struck and killed the Egyptian security personnel. On Saturday, the Mideast Quartet -- the United Nations, the United States, Russia, and the European Union -- condemned Thursday's ""premeditated terrorism"" attacks on Israel, and warned that it remains concerned about the situation in Gaza.  It also expressed concern about the security situation in Egypt's Sinai peninsula. ""Recent commitments by the Egyptian government to address the security situation in the Sinai are important, and the Quartet encourages the Egyptian government to find a lasting resolution to the issue of Sinai security,"" it said. No one in Israel's armed forces intentionally acted to harm Egyptian security personnel, Amos Gilad, a defense official involved in maintaining Israel's relationship with the Egyptian military, told Israeli Radio on Saturday.  He also stressed the strategic importance of the 1979 peace treaty between the two countries. Outside the Israeli Embassy in Cairo, hundreds of demonstrators gathered Saturday to protest the killings and demand Egypt sever its ties with Israel. Egyptian state-run TV showed protesters burning Israeli flags and chanting ""Egyptian blood is not cheap."" Israel believes that the attacks had their roots in Gaza, but were coming out of the neighboring Egyptian region of Sinai. ""The Egyptian control over Sinai is weakening and this is probably the reason that this attack that originated in Gaza has made it all the way down here,"" Barak said Thursday. The Egyptian claims of Israeli forces killing three of its security members and injuring four surfaced Thursday, the same day Israel launched airstrikes on Gaza. Senior Egyptian military and security forces told CNN that two members of the Central Security Force and one military officer were killed in clashes east of Ras Al-Naqab, 13 kilometers north of Taba. At the time, an Israeli helicopter was in the area chasing militants in the aftermath of the attacks on Israelis, said Gen. Saleh Al Masry, head of security in North Sinai Province. ""The Israeli ground troops engaged with armed militants 200 meters from the Egyptian border which may have also led to casualties on the Egyptian side,"" said Lt. Col. Amr Imam, the Egyptian army spokesman. ""We have reinforced our border guards and raised the level of alert."" The rising tensions also come as questions are being raised in Israel about the Egyptian military presence in the demilitarized zone in Sinai, which was created under the terms of the Camp David Agreement signed in 1978 between Egypt and Israel. Since the overthrow of Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak, the security situation in Sinai has deteriorated. Senior Egyptian officials said several weeks ago that more than 23,000 prisoners escaped from prisons in Egypt in late January and February because of the breakdown in regime authority. Additionally, travel between Egypt and Gaza has become much easier since the Military Council reopened the border crossing at Rafah in late May. But along with traders -- and Gazans just wanting a break from their cramped sliver of territory -- there are signs that Islamist groups are taking advantage of weaker security. The crossing is the only land passage out of Gaza not directly under Israeli control. Egypt claims it has been cracking down on terror groups in its portion of the Sinai, exchanging fire with militants on its side of the border. ""The security at border has not been affected by the revolution, and no one from Egypt has crossed through to conduct the attacks on Israel,""  said Khaled Fouda, the governor of Southern Sinai, an Egyptian province. He said the distance between where the Egyptian forces were attacked and the border of Egypt was too far to allow the sort of attack against the Israelis that sparked the strikes on Gaza.

"(CNN) -- A monument to communism, the Palace of Culture and Science dominates Warsaw's skyline. But soon the city's most prominent piece of architecture, a ""gift"" from Josef Stalin in the 1950s, will be joined by a building that will reflect the spirit of 21st century Poland. Designed by Daniel Libeskind, Zlota 44 is the star architect's first project in the country of his birth. Currently under construction the 54-story luxury apartment building that is supposed to resemble an eagle, Poland's nation symbol, is situated opposite the Palace of Culture and Science and close to one of the city's few synagogues that survived the Second World War. Explore more with Eye on Poland . Many see it as a statement of the country's desire to continue its revival and redefine its identity. ""Now this world-recognized architect is coming back to Poland and building a symbolic structure in front of the Palace of Culture, a symbolic structure of communism,"" said Alicia Kosciesza of the Zlota 44 project. Libeskind left Poland with his parents as an emigrant to the U.S. when he was 13, but he has seen his homeland transformed since his childhood. ""I grew up under the gray skies of communism, a depressed society, a totalitarian regime. A dismal period really."" he said. ""I return now and it's a new country, it's a renaissance. Skies are blue, people have light in their eyes, there's energy."" Libeskind commonly accentuates the positives and transformative affects that buildings can have. From the Jewish Museum in Berlin, to his role as Master Planner for the new World Trade Center buildings in New York, his structures have engaged and inspired many and made him one of the world's most sought-after architects. ""The re-building of Warsaw shows that despite the horrors (of the past) it's a beautiful city,"" he said. ""It wasn't rebuilt perfectly (after the Second World War), but it's a city that has always had the spirit of something positive."" Libeskind's Polish roots and formative years living in the U.S. as an immigrant are experiences that have shaped his attitude and were a direct inspiration for his plans for the World Trade Center. ""This is a place that needs to have a spiritual feeling, this isn't just a piece of real estate anymore,"" he said of the World Trade Center site. ""(When visiting 'Ground Zero') I looked South and I saw the Statute of Liberty and I saw myself arriving on that ship (when I was 13) and I thought, '""That's what America is like, that what this site is about.'

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Demonstrations that began with quiet determination on the internet more than three weeks ago erupted into riotous jubilation Friday evening, moments after it was announced that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was stepping aside. Protesters swarmed army tanks that had been deployed to keep order, banged drums, blew whistles and frantically waved Egyptian flags in celebration. They danced in circles and chanted. Processions of cars made their way down city streets, drivers honking horns and waving flags. Fireworks erupted outside the presidential palace in Cairo and in the streets of Alexandria. Some men and women dropped to their knees and began to pray. ""I did not believe it at first,""  Egyptian-American Sarah el-Helewsaid.  ""I feel complete joy."" ""Freedom!"" crowds chanted outside the white carved walls of the presidential palace. ""God is great!"" they shouted in Tahrir Square. On the front lines of the movement, protester and actor Khalid Abdallah, best known for his role in ""The Kite Runner,"" expressed complete shock at Mubarak's decision to step down, but said Egyptians now feel like ""destiny is in their hands,"" and he praised supporters of their struggle. ""Thank you to everyone who has stood in solidarity with us,"" Abdallah told CNN's Wolf Blitzer.  He said Egyptians are grateful for those who ""told our true story."" Abdallah recounted seeing and hearing the voices of children. ""Hold your head high,"" Abdallah said they chanted, ""you're an Egyptian."" Fears that the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamic umbrella group, could hijack Egypt's pro-democracy movement have made headlines during the 18 days of protests in the country, but the group has stated more than once that they are not seeking power.  On Friday, they celebrated the news of Mubarak's departure with the rest of the Egyptians. ""We are opening a new bridge now on history,"" Muslim Brotherhood spokesman Essam El Erian told CNN.  ""This is [a] critical moment.""  Erian said of the pro-democracy revolution that he said he believes will shape the future of Egypt. In Alexandria, Fatima Puskar, an American living with her Egyptian husband, Emad, said she was watching Egyptian state TV when news of Mubarak's resignation was announced. ""We could hear people, even before the end of the statement I heard people outside of the window shouting and honking their horns,"" she said. Omar Sultan of Cairo said he felt like he played a role in forcing Mubarak to resign by taking part in demonstrations. ""Everyone is very happy. No one imagined this day would come,"" he said. ""I've never been prouder to be an Egyptian."" Two of the main bridges connecting east and west Cairo were like parking lots as people got out and began hugging and dancing. ""Life is great now. I think I will have a much better future now. It is a different era,"" a 17-year-old girl named Fatima told CNN. The news of Mubarak's resignation, and the revolution that led to the announcement, has also sparked a renewed spirit and proud voice for Egyptians. ""I stopped writing -- as a journalist -- because I felt there was nothing to write about,""  said Salah Marakby, a 76-year-old retiree.  ""But I feel now that the pyramid of corruption has fallen. I want to go back to writing now!"" One of the movement's key activists, Wael Ghonim, credited ordinary Egyptians for persisting through historic and sometimes violent protests that led to the first ouster of an Egyptian leader since 1952. ""Congratulations Egypt the criminal has left the palace,"" said Ghonim, who was jailed for a week and a half by the Mubarak regime and whose emotional commentary after his release helped galvanize protesters. Addressing Mubarak and his allies, Ghonim said the country should hold them accountable for their actions, including the deaths of protesters killed during what had been peaceful demonstrations. ""I just want to say to Hosni Mubarak and to Omar Suleiman and to all those people who thought that being in power means you can oppress people, you know, hard-luck guys, you know, at the end of the day, we have a choice and we've made our choice,"" he said. ""They convinced us for 30 years that Egypt had died, that there was no more Egypt,"" he said in an interview with CNN, referring to the nearly 30 years of autocratic rule under Mubarak. ""We were all looking for Egypt and thank God we found her today."" Ghonim, who helped set up the initial Facebook page calling for protests, said it was time to celebrate, and said he has confidence that Egypt will not fall into dictatorship again. ""Today, I am telling you Egypt is going to be a democratic state,"" said Ghonim, who is on leave of absence from his job at Google. Mohamed ElBaradei, a leading opposition figure, showed his support for Mubarak's decision to step down through Twitter. ""Egypt Today is a free and proud nation.  God Bless,"" was posted by ElBaradei Friday night on the social media website. Amre Moussa, secretary general of Arab League, said he is optimistic that the country is on the right path. ""We have achieved what the people wanted,"" he said. ""Now we must build a new Egypt."" The future many Egyptians had dared to imagine seems much brighter now. ""No matter how hard things are,"" Abdallah said,  ""you can get through and you can keep dreaming."" ""Today is our time,"" a 46-year old woman told CNN.  ""We have learned that it is not too difficult to change. Sadly, some people died on the way."" Egypt's ambassador to the United States spoke with CNN Friday about the what it will take to form a new democratic government and whether future elections will be fair and open. ""Certainly the voice of the people has been heard loud and clear,"" Sameh Shoukry said.  ""It will be the ballot box and the voice of the Egyptian people that will determine the direction of any future governments.""

"Buenos Aires, Argentina (CNN) -- Marianela Galli waited 34 years for the men who killed her family to be punished. On Wednesday night, inside a packed courtroom in downtown Buenos Aires, she learned their fates. ""We have justice and these people are going to jail and I can finally walk in the streets without them,"" she said. Sixteen former Argentine military officers received sentences ranging from 18 years to life in prison for their roles in human rights abuses committed during Argentina's 1976 to 1983 dictatorship. The bloody era, when the military used kidnapping, torture and murder to silence dissidents, became known as the ""Dirty War."" The seven-year junta claimed an estimated 30,000 lives. Galli's parents and grandmother were among the victims. On June 12, 1977, 16-month-old Marianela, her mother, Patricia, her father, Mario, and her grandmother, Violeta, were kidnapped from their home in Buenos Aires. They were taken to the Argentine Naval Mechanics School, known as ESMA, the largest and most notorious of dozens of detention centers operated by the Argentine military at that time. After three days in captivity, the military released Galli and gave her to her father's family. Her parents and grandmother remained inside the ESMA, where they endured two months of torture before being drugged and then thrown alive from an airplane into the chilly waters of the South Atlantic. Thousands perished in the weekly Wednesday ""death flights,"" and most of their bodies were never recovered. ""I don't have my parents with me. I don't have my grandmother with me. They changed my life against my will and there is nothing I can do about it,"" she said. Marianela GalliÂ´s story is remarkable, but it is not unique. Five-thousand people passed through the white-washed walls of the ESMA. Most were never seen again. The conclusion of the two-year ESMA trial on Wednesday night provided a sense of closure for victims' family members and friends, thousands of whom braved chilly spring temperatures outside the courthouse to watch a judge read the sentences on a big-screen television. ""This trial took many years to happen, but thankfully our former president, Nestor Kirchner, embraced the human rights cause. That is why we are here today,"" said Tati Almeida, a member of the human rights groups Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, whose son, Alejandro, was ""disappeared"" by the military. The silent marches staged by victims' mothers and grandmothers first brought the world's attention to the atrocities taking place in Argentina in the late 1970s. They have continued their efforts to seek justice for the victims ever since. ""This is a very emotional moment for me. It will take me several days to process it. Because from the first accounts I gave years ago up until now, repeatedly testifying and testifying, we now finally have the first sentences,"" said Munu Actis, a survivor of the ESMA detention center. As Judge Daniel Obligado read out the sentences, the loudest jeers were reserved for Alfredo Astiz, a former Navy captain whose boyish looks and deceitful ways earned him the nickname the ""Blonde Angel of Death."" Astiz worked as a Navy spy, gaining the trust of human rights activists and then choosing which ones to target for disappearance. Astiz has been unrepentant for his actions, saying he was simply following orders. ""This is not justice, this is a lynching,"" he said shortly before his sentencing. Astiz received a life sentence for his role in the deaths of renowned Argentine writer and journalist Rodolfo Walsh, French nuns Alice Domon and Leonie Duquet, and Azucena Villaflor, one of the founders of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo. Mario Galli, Marianela Galli's father, had come up in the naval ranks together with Astiz before deciding to leave the military because of their increasingly violent tactics. It was a decision that ultimately cost him his life. A French court sentenced Astiz to life in prison in 1990 for the kidnapping and killing of two French nuns. But he remained free for more than a decade. For many years, an amnesty law in Argentina giving former military officials immunity from prosecution over human rights abuses protected him. Galli recalls seeing him one night in 1998 when she was working as a waitress at a Buenos Aires restaurant. Astiz walked in at 1 a.m. and ordered a coffee. ""I felt absolutely helpless when I saw him. I couldn't believe that this man who had helped kill my parents was allowed to be free,"" she said. The ESMA trial was just one of many taking place in Argentina. Amnesty laws protecting former military officers were stripped in 2005 under the leadership of the late president Nestor Kirchner. His wife and successor, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, has also been a vocal proponent of putting former officers on trial. This human rights initiative has helped bolster support for Fernandez, who was re-elected to a four-year term on October 23rd with 54 percent of the vote. ""The Kirchners are the ones who have made these trials happen, and I am eternally grateful to them for it,"" Jorge Morresi said after the sentencing on Wednesday. His cousin was ""disappeared"" in 1977. The sentencing of the officers took more than one hour to read. When it was finished, thousands outside the courthouse hugged, cried, danced and sang. As she embraced her aunt, Monica, who raised her following her parents' death, Marianela Galli reflected on the historic day that she had long hoped would arrive. ""This is a different kind of sensation. I am sad, and very happy because justice is coming, finally,"" she said.","16 former military officers are sentenced for human rights abuses .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama announced Friday that states will be allowed to opt out of certain requirements imposed by the controversial No Child Left Behind law, the landmark education reform initiative passed with broad bipartisan support a decade ago. The administration will immediately begin reviewing state applications to waive various demands imposed by the law in return for credible commitments to close lingering achievement gaps. ""Higher standards are the right goal. Accountability is the right goal. Closing the achievement gap is the right goal,"" Obama said at the White House. ""But experience has taught us that in its implementation, No Child Left Behind has some serious flaws."" Among other things, the law, which passed 2001, requires public schools to meet targets aimed at making all students proficient in reading and math by 2014 or face stiff penalties. The Department of Education has predicted that, without waivers, up to 82% of the nation's schools could miss that target and end up facing penalties including the loss of federal education dollars. Obama blasted Congress for failing to change the law, a failure that forced the administration to act on its own, the president said. ""We can't afford to wait for an education system that isn't doing everything it should for our kids,"" Obama said. ""We've got to act now and harness all the good ideas coming out of our states (and) coming out of our schools."" A senior administration official speaking to reporters on a conference call Thursday said the law ""is hurting children by denying the children most at risk the resources they really need."" Under Obama's reforms, states will be encouraged to enact accountability standards that don't treat all schools the same. Specifically, schools will have to implement new teacher and principal accountability standards. Local districts will have to set basic guidelines to evaluate a teacher's performance based on a number of factors, not simply student performance. ""The purpose is not to give states and districts a reprieve from accountability, but rather to unleash energy to improve our schools at the local level,"" Obama said in a separate statement released by the White House. One of the major criticisms of the current No Child Left Behind guidelines is that it encouraged schools to lower standards rather than improve. The new guidelines ""should reduce the pressure to teach the test and the narrowing of the curriculum,"" one administration official said. Six months ago, the administration sent Congress its plan to revamp No Child Left Behind. That legislation, however, has stalled. The administration insists it hasn't enacted the new changes alone. Instead, it has reached out and received input from 45 states that helped develop the new guidelines for opting out of No Child Left Behind standards. In addition, senior administration officials told reporters that 44 states and the District of Columbia are working to adopt a common set of state-developed college and career-ready standards. Some critics fear the new guidelines will ultimately give the federal government an even larger role in states' education decisions. Administration officials deny the accusation, instead maintaining that the new guidelines will actually give states more flexibility, including how to spend 20% of their Title I money, which funds low-income education and can account for as much as a billion dollars nationwide. Currently, No Child Left Behind requires states spend that portion of federal education dollars on tutoring. The administration says many states and school districts are already moving toward the new guidelines. States can file a request for a waiver from the requirements by mid-November and the waivers could be granted in early 2012. CNN's Lesa Jansen and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report .","President Obama says he will grant waivers from No Child Left Behind requirements .

"Moncks Corner, South Carolina (CNN) -- Every day, before sunrise, Zubaidah Gibbs wakes to pray, then spends hours more singing praises to God under a tree outside her home. She reflects on the setting and thanks God for the beautiful environment around her in this small Southern town. But this Muslim woman wasn't always at peace with herself, or her religion. Her 55 years have been a journey from wanting to be white to being proud to be black; from the urban North to the rural South; from studying religions to finding a community in Islam. As a young girl in the 1960s, ""I would have done anything in the world to be white with blue eyes and blonde hair with small lips,"" Gibbs said. ""I didn't hang out with girls who were dark like me, because I felt like they were ugly like me."" She became more comfortable with her race as a teenager, when she heard a different message: James Brown singing ""Say it loud, I'm black and I'm proud!"" ""I was, like, 'Wow, this is interesting,'"" she said. ""I started getting rid of [my relaxed hairstyle] and accepting my hair natural, and I was a little bit more comfortable with myself."" But her pride in her roots didn't fill the void she felt in her heart. She was still searching for connections that transcended ethnicity. Her mother, a Christian, encouraged Gibbs to visit various churches around her home in New York, some led by Protestants, Jehovah's Witnesses and Catholics. She was 17 when a blind date with a Muslim man ended at a mosque. ""I heard the adhan [call to prayer] playing, and I saw the people with their long garbs on, and the sisters -- and I just didn't want to leave,"" she said. That same year, she embraced Islam, attracted to the message of peace and its disregard for color. ""Islam helped me to identify with the beauty within as well as outside. ...It balanced me out because now I understand who I am as a human,"" Gibbs said. Gibbs' spiritual journey had only begun. At age 42, she moved from New York to South Carolina to escape the crowds of the city with her four children. She didn't know of a mosque in the little town where she'd settled, Moncks Corner, but was reluctant to go 30 miles south to Charleston. So, she prayed about it. One day, Gibbs said, she saw men in kufis, traditional African skullcaps, building what looked like a little house on what had once been known as the ""whites-only"" side of Moncks Corner. She discovered it was to be a mosque, just as she'd prayed for. Today, the mosque, Masjid Muhajarun Wal Ansars, is a small white brick building whose members are mostly African-American. They practice mainstream Islam, like 2.45 million other American Muslims, not Nation of Islam, a separate religious tradition associated with black Muslims. Here, they marry Islamic ritual, racial understanding and traditional southern culture. At the mosque, Gibbs met a spiritual mentor, Sheikh Harun Faye. Faye was born in Thies, Senegal, and came to South Carolina in 1994 after marrying an American. ""I belong to a very large family, and generation after generation all we have done is to lead people to the way of God,"" Faye said. ""So, when I got here, the first thing I wanted was a mosque where I can call the people to God and teach them Islam. And that is what I do."" He opened the mosque in 1996, with five people. The congregation now consists of more than 150 members. Gibbs was among its first members. She was initially attracted to the mosque's welcoming nature, open-door policy and community outreach. Over the last 14 years, the mosque has assisted thousands of people in need, many of them homeless and ex-convicts. ""Anybody, Muslim, non-Muslim, you know, African-American, non-African-American, anybody who comes and knocks on that door and said 'I'm hungry,' or 'I can't pay my light bill,' or 'I need to lay down here and sleep,' we don't care who you are, where you come from. You could be the worst crook in the world, we really wouldn't know,"" said Imam Rasheed Nurudin, the prayer leader of the mosque who fills in when Faye is absent. The mosque's fusion of black American and Islamic culture has allowed members like Gibbs to harmonize her identity and connect with a message of unity. ""When I came and listened to the sheikh and he spoke about God and the Prophet Mohammed, it wasn't about 'black power this,' and 'black man that,'"" Gibbs said. ""It was about humanity. It was about God. ""It's like you have a veil when you come into the mosque and all of a sudden the veil is lifted and you can see like you've never seen before. Everything looks different."" The center is a unique cultural crossroads in the deep South, said Anisah Bagasra, an instructor at Claflin University in Orangeburg, South Carolina, who has studied the mosque and how its members incorporate Islamic rituals into their daily lives. ""When you go for their Eid [holiday] dinners in particular, this is where you really see both Southern hospitality emerge and ... southern home cooking, but everything's halal, so it shows that religious mandating as well,"" said Bagasra. ""[It] represents a growing trend in contemporary Muslim communities in the United States in terms of that fusion of traditional cultures with the American culture, while maintaining a pride in their Islamic identity."" Gibbs enjoys the duality and expresses her culture through her clothing, head scarf and singing West African-influenced Islamic prayers, a practice uncommon in other mosques. ""It makes me feel happy. It makes me feel a serenity that words cannot describe, because I'm closer to God with the community,"" she said. ""Everyone is singing and praising God together."" For Gibbs, finding a mosque in the rural South was key to her inner peace. It fulfilled the spiritual companionship she'd been seeking for years, she said. ""This community means a family that I never had and a strength that I never knew,"" she said. ""[It] meant opening up doors that were shut in terms of my self esteem, in terms of my direction, my aim ... my destiny."" She paused to rearrange her scarf, and her eyes began to water. ""I'm happy.""","Zubaidah Gibbs struggled with her race and religious identity early in life.

"Karachi, Pakistan (CNN) -- Do not mistake eight-year-old Bilal Ahmed's skin-and-bones body, his beguiling smile and his big beaming eyes for weakness. Bilal changes when he steps into a boxing ring. When the pint-sized Pakistani fighter climbed into a shabby old ring at an outdoor youth center, his smile turned into a stone cold scowl. At the sound of the bell that marked the start of round one, his tiny fists at the end of his stick-like arms turned into pain-inflicting projectiles, pounding away at his opponent. ""I want to hit my opponent,"" says Bilal, minutes before the fight. ""All I think about is winning."" Bilal is obsessed with winning because, to him, boxing is more than a sport. It's the one chance he has to escape Lyari, one of the poorest, toughest and most dangerous neighborhoods in the sprawling southern port city of Karachi. Drug and gang violence is rampant here, killing nearly 100 people this year alone. ""There is shooting at night,"" Bilal says. ""I wake up and go to my mom. When I grow up I'm going to take my family away from here."" But for Lyari's boys, the future is often bleak. Many here blame the government for failing to keep neighborhoods safe and a broken school system for robbing children of the chance to succeed. For decades boxing has given thousands of Lyari's kids what the government has not -- a safe place to grow, learn and chase a dream. African immigrants brought boxing to Lyari in the 1940s, when Karachi was still part of British-ruled India. More than 70 years later, 22 boxing clubs, run by volunteers and private donations, have made this neighborhood Pakistan's boxing factory. ""This is the second Cuba,"" says the head of the local boxing association, Asghar Baloch, referring to the Caribbean nation that has produced some of the best boxers in the world. ""If these kids weren't here, they would be with guns and arms,"" he says. ""If we continue our positive activities, we will get positive results."" Positive results at Lyari's boxing clubs aren't necessarily trophies and victories in the ring. They're polite, healthy children who laugh and play, children who finish school. But on this night it's all about winning for Bilal, who's taking on a bigger and taller opponent at an important tournament. His opponent overpowers him in the opening round but Bilal stands his ground. Round two is too close to call but Bilal wins the third and final round with lightning quick combinations and powerful right hooks. The referee raises Bilal's arm in victory and back comes the big smile on the skinny little kid whose dream for a better life lives on.","Bilal Ahmed is from Lyari, one of the poorest and most dangerous neighborhoods in Karachi .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama spoke with Egypt's president moments after Hosni Mubarak addressed his country, telling the Egyptian that he must make good on his promises and avoid a violent response to the thousands of protesters in the streets. With parts of his capital ablaze, Mubarak said he was asking his government to resign and would soon announce a new one, pledging to address the concerns of thousand of Egyptians protesting in Cairo's streets. ""I just spoke to him after his speech,"" Obama said, ""and told him he has a responsibility to give meaning to those words, to take concrete steps and actions that deliver on that promise. Violence will not address the grievances of the Egyptian people. Suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away. ""This moment of volatility has to be turned into a moment of promise,"" Obama said. The U.S. president repeated his administration's call for the Egyptian government to restore access to the internet and cell phone service and urged ""concrete steps that advance the rights of the Egyptian people."" Obama's remarks, delivered from State Dining Room, were the strongest yet from the United States. ""There must be reform,"" he said, ""political, social and economic reforms that meet the aspirations of the Egyptian people. ""In the absence of these reforms,"" he said, ""grievances have built up over time. ""The United States will continue to stand up for the rights of the Egyptian people and work with their government in pursuit of a future that is more just, more free and more hopeful,"" he concluded. In his remarks, Mubarak was clear that he had no intentions of stepping down -- yet his resignation is what the protesters are demanding. And privately, U.S. officials fear that Mubarak may be in over his head as protests against his 30-year rule showed no signs of ending. A senior administration official said the White House saw Mubarak's address as ""hardly conciliatory and highly disappointing, but what did you expect?"" It's clear, the official said -- speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter -- that Mubarak believes he can ride this out, ""and this time, we're not so sure that is the right assumption."" Administration officials had hoped Mubarak would promise an immediate and open dialogue, the official said. Before the speech, senior U.S. officials had similar thoughts, worrying that the Egyptian government may not realize all it is up against or what the protesters are saying. Mubarak, they said, has two choices: to embrace meaningful reforms or to continue the crackdown. The United States is being very careful not to be too tough on the Egyptian leader directly, the senior officials said, because they fear that might drive the government into a survivalist mentality, causing a further crackdown. The officials said conversations with the Egyptian government are taking place across the U.S. administration, including with U.S. Ambassador to Egypt Margaret Scobey, who has participated in several videoconferences with Washington during the day. A senior State Department official said, ""our initial impression is that he emphasized security far more than reform."" ""We'll see what the implications for the government reshuffle are, but he was not particularly forthcoming in the speech,"" said the official, who couldn't speak on the record because of the sensitivity of the situation. Earlier, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the administration is ""very concerned"" about the situation in Egypt, adding that at risk could be economic and military aid from the United States. ""This is a situation that will be solved by the people of Egypt,"" Gibbs said. ""We are watching very closely the actions of the government, the police and all of those in the military."" The United States will review its ""assistance posture"" to Egypt based on events that take place in the coming days, he said. Gibbs declined to elaborate how the United States might alter relations with a key ally in the region but urged restraint as massive demonstrations have resulted in widespread property damage, including at the offices of Egypt's ruling party. That building was burned and ransacked by protesters in Cairo on Friday, Nile TV reported. A CNN witness saw the building ablaze. Gibbs said the collective consequences of the government's actions will be the subject of a review in determining whether the U.S. will alter assistance toward Egypt. ""Within that review is military"" assistance, Gibbs said. Egypt receives about $1.3 billion in military aid from Washington every year, second only to Israel, and has received nearly $30 billion in economic aid since 1975, according to State Department figures. ""The die is cast,"" said Leslie H. Gelb, the president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations. ""The administration has made clear that it leans toward the demonstrators."" Gibbs said, ""we've reach a point where the grievances of the people have to be addressed through concrete reforms"" but would not elaborate on the potential fallout if the Mubarak government -- considered a strategic ally in the region -- does not survive the protests. ""We don't know who these people are or if they are at all capable of putting a government together,"" Gelb said, cautioning of a power vacuum left by the possible collapse of the three-decade-old government. Often considered a crucial power broker in the Middle East, Egypt has played major roles in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and in controlling the Suez Canal, a strategic passageway for trade across the region. Earlier Friday, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called on Egypt's government ""to allow peaceful protests and reverse the unprecedented steps it has taken to cut off communications."" ""We are deeply concerned about the use of violence by Egyptian police and security forces against protesters, and we call on the Egyptian government to do everything within its power to restrain its security forces,"" Clinton said Friday, referring to the unfolding crisis in several Egyptian cities where tens of thousands of demonstrators clashed with state security forces. ""At the same time, protesters should also refrain from violence and express themselves peacefully,"" she said. ""As a partner, we strongly believe that the Egyptian government needs to engage with the Egyptian people immediately,"" Clinton said. ""They need to view civil society as their partner, not a threat."" Servers of Egypt's main internet provider were down early Friday, including servers for the Egyptian government's sites and for the U.S. Embassy in Cairo. Early Friday, Gibbs said that he is ""very concerned about violence in Egypt,"" tweeting that the ""government must respect the rights of the Egyptian people & turn on social networking and internet."" But at least one internet service provider, Noor, was still working. The U.S. State Department on Friday urged Americans traveling abroad to ""defer non-essential travel to Egypt."" ""U.S. citizens in Egypt should remain in their residences or hotels until the situation stabilizes,"" the agency added in a written travel alert. The agency warned that Egyptian security forces may block off the area around the U.S. Embassy as a result of massive demonstrations that have set vehicles ablaze and resulted in widespread property damage. ""U.S. citizens should not attempt to come to the U.S. Embassy or the Tahrir Square area at such times,"" the statement said, urging Americans to carry identification and a working cell phone. Delta Air Lines spokeswoman Susan Elliott said Friday that the carrier's last flight from Cairo will depart on Saturday, and all other Cairo service is indefinitely suspended as a result of the civil unrest. President Barack Obama has requested ""multiple briefings"" on Egypt, White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said Friday. He has not called Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, the target of the protesters' anger, ""but there is daily contact between the U.S. and Egyptian governments through various channels, including the embassies and other organizations in which Obama's messages and concerns are relayed,"" Vietor said. Former Clinton Defense Secretary William Cohen said Obama is likely reluctant to call Mubarak ""without it appearing that we are directing what Mubarak should do and he is responding to the control of the United States."" ""I think that, if anything, one might ask why hasn't President Mubarak called President Obama and said, 'Are you with me or against me?' I mean, that would be a call that might also be worthy of consideration,"" Cohen said. Obama has urged the government and demonstrators to refrain from violence as protests continued. ""It is very important that people have mechanisms in order to express legitimate grievances,"" he said this week. Vice President Joe Biden said on ""PBS NewsHour"" on Thursday that Mubarak should listen to protesters but rejected claims that the embattled Egyptian president is a dictator. Still, Biden said, ""violence isn't appropriate, and people have a right to protest."" Obama received information on Egypt from national security adviser Tom Donilon on Friday and is expected to receive additional updates throughout the day. He noted Thursday that Mubarak has been ""very helpful on a range of tough issues,"" but he said he has pushed the Egyptian leader to take steps toward reform. On Wednesday, Gibbs said the U.S. administration was ""monitoring quite closely the situation in Egypt and continue to do so, obviously, in Tunisia."" The protests in Egypt started after weeks of similar disturbances sparked a revolution in Tunisia and forced then-President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to flee the country. ""This is an important time for the government to demonstrate its responsiveness to the people of Egypt in recognizing those universal rights,"" Gibbs said. CNN's Elise Labott and John King contributed to this report.","NEW: Obama calls Mubarak and tells him to openly address his people's grievances .

"Washington (CNN) -- Even as he charges into his re-election battle, President Barack Obama has a festering weakness on a flank that, by all accounts, ought to be rock solid: the one held by African-American Democrats. Their support for his programs, belief in his leadership and enthusiasm for another term is softening just as he needs it most. In the past few weeks, the president has been chastised by the Congressional Black Caucus for avoiding troubled inner-city districts, peppered with tough questions on BET, and suffered plummeting poll numbers among black voters. That last item is critical. During the 2008 election, their turnout was massive and their support almost unanimous. Now, however, a Washington Post/ABC News poll finds that black voters with a ""strongly favorable"" view of Obama dropped from 86% to 58% in just five months. ""Patience is running out,"" says Reginald Daniel, a professor of sociology at the University of California Santa Barbara. Daniel has written extensively about race and politics. ""People are disappointed because I think their expectations were way too high to begin with."" Many political analysts sum up those ""expectations run amok"" this way: White voters heralded the election of a black president as a sign that long-standing racial gaps were closing, and they expected Obama to play a post-racial role; a president for everyone, who just happened to be black. Meanwhile, many African-American voters just as clearly saw his election as a great leap forward and hoped the presence of a black president in the Oval Office would bring a new level of understanding, acknowledgment, and relief for their community's problems. ""Finding a middle ground is almost an impossibility,"" Daniels says. ""It's just the worst position to be in."" The driving problem, however, is neither black nor white -- it is green. Joblessness, bad for everyone, is much worse in African-American communities, where unemployment is pushing 17%, the worst since the 1980s. That is what triggered the revolt in the CBC and those stinging questions during that TV interview. The president is pushing back, pointing out that his initiatives, such as health care reform and the recent jobs bill, especially help lower-income families, many of whom are black. On BET, he quickly dismissed talk about a dearth of specific programs for minorities. ""What people are saying all across the country is we are hurting and we've been hurting for a long time,"" the president said. ""The question is: How can we make sure the economy is working for every single person?"" He also insisted that even if black leaders are grousing, it's not really about him or his policies. ""There's always going to be somebody who is critical of the president of the United States."" And at a CBC fundraising dinner he raised eyebrows by telling members to quit complaining and start ""marching"" with him for change. But if the reaction of Rep. Maxine Waters, D-California, is any gauge, he'll have to do a lot more selling. She summed up his comments in a word: ""Curious."" To be sure, most African-Americans still support Obama. Political analysts do not expect a massive shift of their votes to the Republicans; and even the president's most adamant black critics often follow their barbs with a quick salve, saying African-American voters ultimately will not oppose him. Still, the danger for the White House is not that black citizens will vote against Obama, but that they won't vote at all. A lackluster turnout in just a few key states could tip the electoral balance against him. What's more, every moment he spends making sure black Democrats come to the polls increases his risk of alienating white voters, and is time lost winning over independents, whom he also must have. Politically, it is hard for a candidate to tiptoe through such a black-and-white minefield. For a president, it is even tougher.","In recent weeks, Obama's support among blacks has been beset by troubles .

"Paris (CNN) -- A judge placed France's richest woman, L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt, under the guardianship of her grandson on Monday, her lawyer said. Bertrand Favreau, one of Bettencourt's lawyers, said Jean-Victor Meyers, the eldest grandson of the 88 year-old woman, has been designated her guardian. ""It is a very disappointing decision that's for sure. It will be hard for me to tell her this decision because it will be unbearable for her,"" Favreau said. Last year, Bettencourt's daughter, Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers, declared in court that her mother was not mentally competent to handle her own affairs. Bettencourt-Meyers accused a photographer of bilking her mother out of a billion euros. Bettencourt was friends with the photographer, Francois-Marie Banier, and allegedly gave him the money. The daughter took the case to court in an effort to recover the funds. She later dropped the suit. In a statement Monday, Bettencourt-Meyers and her two sons, Jean-Victor and Nicolas, acknowledged the ruling. ""Their action has always been guided by the sole wish to see their mother and grandmother truly protected,"" the statement said of the three. ""It is a great relief for them today that (the judge) has recognized their position."" In an interview published Sunday in France's Journal du Dimanche, Bettencourt said she was worried about the judge's decision on Monday. ""I'm trembling, all I can do is pray. Do you think the judge will agree with my daughter?"" said Bettencourt in the interview. ""I'm not going to sleep well tonight. I have a feeling I'm going to be squashed."" Favreau plans to consult with Bettencourt on appealing the ruling and ask that its enforcement be suspended.

"(CNN) -- ""A calculated, cold-blooded predator."" That was how Connecticut Judge James Bentivegna described a then 22-year-old Joshua Komisarjevsky on December 20, 2002, when the defendant was sentenced after being convicted on 12 counts of burglary. Today, Komisarjevsky -- now 31 -- sits in a Connecticut courtroom, where a jury will weigh his guilt on murder charges, and potentially pave the way for a death sentence. Prosecutors say that on July 23, 2007, Komisarjevsky and an accomplice, Steven Hayes, invaded the home of Dr. William Petit, raped and strangled his wife, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, molested one of their daughters, and set the house on fire before attempting to flee. Hawke-Petit and her daughters -- 17-year-old Hayley Petit and 11-year-old Michaela Petit -- died in the invasion of their Cheshire, Connecticut, home. Dr. William Petit, although severely beaten, managed to escape and crawl to a neighbor's residence. Hayes was sentenced to death in December, after being convicted of 16 out of the 17 charges related to the three deaths. Both suspects had lengthy criminal records when they were arrested for the Petit invasion. Komisarjevsky's long rap sheet, in particular, suggest that he was a troubled young man with a penchant for nighttime burglary and crystal meth. Officials with the Connecticut Board of Pardons and Paroles declined to speak with CNN, citing a gag order in the case. But over 200 pages of Komisarjevsky's parole records have been released, which -- along with previous court testimony -- help paint a picture of the accused. One of his former attorneys, William Gerace, said that Komisarjevsky came from a close, religious family. But at the age of 14, he began using drugs -- the same year, he claims, that he found out that he was adopted. By 18, Komisarjevsky had found his drugs of choice: crystal meth and cocaine. He told the parole board that he stole money and electronics from upscale homes to feed his drug habit. Yet a transcript from his 2002 sentencing paints Komisarjevsky as more than just the average thief. According to a police statement read aloud in court that day, Komisarjevsky admitted that he broke into his first house when he was 14 years old. ""I always wore gloves, with the exception of one incident when I was 14. I always acted alone. Approximately a year and a half ago, I acquired night vision goggles... I used the night-vision equipment during the burglaries (over) the past year,"" he said, according to the transcript. Gerace, who was Komisarjevsky's defense attorney at the time, stressed that a need for money, to pay for drugs, drove his client. But he admitted that the way he went about it was unusual. ""Ninety-nine percent of burglaries are (committed by) junkies -- there's nothing romantic about what they do,"" said Gerace. ""That was the first time I'd seen something as exotic as that."" Komisarjevsky confessed that he only broke into homes at night and never during the day -- a point stressed by prosecutors in the 2002 trial. They said his affinity for breaking into people's homes at night showed that he wanted a confrontation, since that was the time when the residents were the most likely to be at home. Speaking during his December 2002 sentencing, Komisarjevsky appeared repentant. He addressed the court saying, ""I've turned my back on my faith in God and my family. And in doing so, I fell flat on my face and deep into hard drugs...the crimes I committed was weighing so heavily on my shoulders."" But the judge was not moved by Komisarjevsky's show of remorse, sentencing him to nine years in prison plus six years of special parole, which has greater restrictions than typical probation. In April 2007, he was paroled. And three months later, Komisarjevsky was arrested for the Petit home invasion and murders. What happened then, and what may have driven Komisarjevsky, remains a mystery to Gerace, his former attorney. ""He was a very complex young man. I don't think I've met anyone quite that complex, and I sensed there was an abundance of issues that had to be dealt with,"" Gerace said. ""I wish him well, and I hope the jury makes the right decision.""","Joshua Komisarjevsky was convicted in 2002 on 12 counts of burglary .

"(CNN) -- After an eight-year hiatus, Buffy is back! Not really, but for some fans of Sarah Michelle Gellar it's the closest they can get at this point. The actress made her highly anticipated return to TV on Tuesday night in The CW's ""Ringer."" Playing ex-stripper Bridget and her wealthy twin sister Siobhan, Gellar's characters are a far cry from her days as the now-iconic vampire slayer on ""Buffy."" But fans of the late supernatural series agree, they'd follow the actress just about anywhere: And that includes her new film noir-type soap. Though The CW's programming tends to skew a bit younger, ""Ringer,"" which was originally created with CBS in mind, maintains a more adult quality. Potentially perfect for fans of Joss Whedon's cult hit, many of whom have likely matured with Gellar, now 34. ""This is a good way for fans who loved 'Buffy' to sort of continue on with [Gellar],"" Hollywood.com's TV editor Kelsea Stahler said. ""Because they're older, I think it can appeal. We don't need vampires or werewolves or the forbidden love between her and Angel. You already love her. The drama is there."" The anticipation helps, too. Gellar went off the air on a high note after ""Buffy"" -- and stayed off. Despite a TV movie, a couple of voiceovers on popular animated series and roles in two film franchises -- ""The Grudge"" and ""Scooby-Doo"" -- the actress chose to lay low while beginning a family with husband Freddie Prinze Jr. The pair welcomed their daughter Charlotte in September 2009. ""The hiatus actually worked wonders for her,"" Stahler added. ""A lot of 'Buffy' fans were teens when 'Buffy' was first on. They grew up with her -- through 'Cruel Intentions,' 'The Grudge.' And when she went off the grid to do her family thing, people started to miss her as opposed to tossing her aside as a has-been."" Like TV bloggers and industry insiders predicted, ""Ringer"" reeled in a solid audience for The CW. However, its 2.7 million viewers don't quite compare to the 3 to 5 million viewers who tuned into The WB-turned-UPN to watch ""Buffy"" each week in the late '90s and early 2000s. But TV consumption is a different beast from when Gellar first graced the small screen. Anywhere in the 2 million viewers range is standard for programs on The CW, which spawned from the aforementioned networks. ""'Buffy' fans are incredibly loyal,"" Daniel Malen, the editor of tvaddict.com, said before the show's premiere, adding, ""They're 100% going to watch 'Ringer.' ... I'm Sure The CW will be happy with [Tuesday's] numbers."" And Gellar's involvement isn't just appealing for viewers. Her ""Ringer"" co-stars are equally as thrilled to have her aboard. ""When we knew Sarah Michelle was attached, that was the biggest draw to the project -- as much as the brilliant script that we both read,"" Ioan Gruffudd, who plays Siobhan's husband, said at Comic-Con. ""The package was just too attractive to turn down."" And as if ""Buffy"" fans weren't enough, throw in fans of ""LOST's"" Nestor Carbonell, who plays FBI agent Victor on the show. ""It's smart casting,"" Stahler said. ""They've picked people who are really going to bring [viewers] along with them."" But, as Malen says, ""It's easy to get someone to tune in, but people have to enjoy the show. Whether or not the 'Buffy' fans stick around, we'll see."" Ryan McFadden, who runs buffyfans.com, said he's sure it will take some time before he can fully separate Gellar from Buffy in her new roles, but he's thrilled to welcome her back to TV. Of course, he adds, there is a chance it won't live up to ""Buffy."" And Gellar knows it. ""You can't top 'Buffy,' "" Gellar, who is also co-executive producer of her new series, told EW prior to ""Ringer's"" debut. ""There's no reason to try. It lives in that world, so you have to do something that's interesting for both the audience and for me as an actor. And that's not necessarily the easiest thing to find after a show like that."" Get more geeky news and musings at the CNN Geek Out blog . Perhaps unsurprisingly, ""Ringer"" was met with mixed reviews. The Hollywood Reporter is among the many outlets to compare Gellar's characters to Buffy, noting, ""[Gellar's performance] hardly lends confidence that she's capable of being the cornerstone of such a show."" The consensus of most reviews being, ""give it a few episodes."" A boating scene shared by both of Gellar's characters attracted a good amount of negative criticism. Stationary clouds and calm water for miles backs the scene, which New York Magazine describes as ""the Sea of Bad Production Values."" ""They might have gotten stuck in the Comically Phony Visual Effects trade wind and been unable to navigate the difficult waters of the Fake Backdrop Strait,"" the article states. But, for ""Buffy"" fan Kelly Creamer, Gellar can do no wrong. ""I noticed [the green screen] a bit, but honestly, it was fine to me,"" she said. ""I mean, it didn't look that bad. ... It didn't affect the performance."" It's just nice to spend time with Gellar again each week, Creamer added. ""It feels like family -- the same kind of comfort.""","Gellar plays ex-stripper Bridget and her wealthy twin sister Siobhan on ""Ringer""

"(CNN) -- A hiker found the body of a skydiving instructor missing for nearly four months, police in Moab, Utah, said Wednesday. The state medical examiner's office positively identified the remains found Sunday near the west Kane Creek area as those of David Brown, 37, according to a police statement. ""It's an extremely rough area,"" Moab Police Chief Mike Navarre told CNN Salt Lake City affiliate KSL. ""It's hard to climb around in there, to walk around in there, even from the air to see something from there; it's not surprising to me that we didn't find him on those first searches."" Police are awaiting further autopsy results. ""Throughout the investigation, we have found no signs of foul play,"" Navarre said. An acquaintance who helped in the search told CNN in July that Brown left behind cash, a passport and his driver's license. Brown disappeared June 29 in the vicinity of Skydive Moab, northwest of the town, said owner Clint MacBeth. MacBeth found Brown's personal items, including an unspent paycheck. Brown's family in Halifax, Nova Scotia, filed a missing person report after he disappeared. According to MacBeth, friends initially assumed Brown had gone to Las Vegas to visit his girlfriend. But they later realized he wore only shorts, a T-shirt and sneakers, making him unequipped to deal with 100-degree-plus temperatures, MacBeth said. Moab is known for its red-rock landscapes and proximity to Arches National Park and Canyonlands National Park.","David Brown was last seen in late June near Moab, Utah .

"Washington (CNN) -- While acknowledging the hard-hit black community and budding criticisms in its ranks, President Barack Obama said in a speech Saturday night to the Congressional Black Caucus that he wouldn't give up -- and urged members of the black community to join him to jump-start the still-sluggish economy. ""I expect all of you to march with me, and press on,"" Obama said. ""... Stop complaining, stop grumbling, stop crying. We are going to press on. We've got work to do."" The unemployment rate among African-Americans is 16.7%, nearly double the national average, while 40% of black children live in poverty. Such facts have made fiscal reforms a priority for caucus members, some of whom -- most of them Democrats -- have criticized Obama for not doing enough on the issue. They include Rep. Maxine Waters, D-California, who at a caucus ""jobs' tour town hall"" in Detroit this month described the unemployment rate among blacks ""unconscionable."" She said the strategy to fix it was unclear, adding that the caucus was ""getting tired"" of waiting for one. She questioned the president's decision to focus on the Midwest during a three-day jobs bus tour in August, stating that the 3 million who live in Iowa -- and are mostly white -- are roughly equal in number to the African-Americans who are out of work. She suggested that Obama's administration seemed more keen to focus on that politically important state than on the black community. ""Are the unemployed in the African-American community, including almost 45% of its youth, as important as the people of Iowa?"" she asked in the statement she released ahead of the president's speech before a joint session of Congress in which he announced his jobs plan. In his speech Saturday, Obama called the situation for many blacks ""heartbreaking, and it's frustrating."" But he also touted achievements of his administration -- such as on the earned income tax credit, anti-foreclosure programs and consumer financial protections -- for making a difference, while admitting more work lies ahead. ""In these hard years, we have won a lot of fights (and) we've done a lot of good,"" he said. ""But we've got more work to do. People are still hurting."" As to the criticism, the president said that ""nobody feels the burden more than I do."" But in a rousing end to his speech, he said he knew addressing problems wasn't going to be easy. One of the chief lessons from the civil rights movement is that ""you can't stop"" in the face of challenges, he said. ""The future rewards those who press on, with patience and determination,"" he said. ""Take off your bedroom slippers, put on your marching shoes."" Obama promoted his recently proposed American Jobs Act during his speech, as well as his tax reform efforts to pay for the bill in part by closing loopholes and effectively having some wealthier Americans pay more in taxes than they do currently. As he did in a nationally televised speech several weeks ago, the president repeatedly used the phrase ""pass this jobs bill"" in promoting its various measures -- including efforts to bolster small businesses, rebuild schools and bridges, and hire back teachers, firefighters and police. In an apparent swipe at Republicans, he urged politicians to fight as hard ""for ordinary folks as you do for all your contributors."" ""We have to make sure that everyone in this country gets a fair shake, and a fair shot, and a chance to get ahead,"" he said. Obama insisted that having ""the folks who have benefited the most ... pay their fair share"" in taxes must be part of any solution, adding, ""This is all about fairness."" The president has proposed a $4,000 tax credit to employers for hiring long-term unemployed workers and higher credits to companies that hire veterans who have been unemployed for at least six months. He also wants to see unemployment insurance extended to prevent 5 million Americans from losing their benefits and stronger programs to help the long-term unemployed through counseling and job training. A number of caucus members -- including Chairman Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri and fellow Democratic representatives like John Lewis of Georgia and Frederica Wilson of Florida -- released statements of support for the American Jobs Act after the president's speech, as did other black leaders, such as Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter. Waters also praised the plan in TV interviews after the speech, though she said she and other caucus members wished the plan was ""even bigger"" and that she hoped the kind of help proposed would get to the people who need it most. More than anything, some black caucus members have said that it is imperative that Obama not only propose a plan, but stick to it. Some of the group's staffers have said they hope the White House learned from experiences in past bills, such as the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul, an instance in which they claim the administration did not negotiate from a position of strength. One thing that the administration appears intent on doing is not ignoring black voters, which overwhelmingly supported him in his 2008 presidential bid. Obama recently met with black journalists and with the leaders of organizations that serve the community -- the NAACP's Ben Jealous, the National Urban League's Marc Morial and the Rev. Al Sharpton from the National Action Network. He also has taped an interview with BET Networks, set to air Monday, in which he is expected to specifically address the ""increase of unemployment among African-Americans since taking office, the current economic crisis, the political landscape around the 2012 presidential election"" among other issues, according to the network. At a panel this month with black media group Interactive One, one of the president's top advisers, Valerie Jarrett, called the unemployment rate in the black community ""unacceptably high"" and said the president understood that ""inaction is not an option."" In remarks to the panel, the president said 20 million African-American workers would benefit from his jobs bill proposal to cut the payroll tax in half, a measure he said would save the average family $1,500 a year. ""It helps out-of-work Americans, including the 1.4 (million) African-American folks and their families who are out of work, by extending unemployment benefits to help support them and their families while they're looking for work,"" the president said. ""And it also reforms the training programs that are available so that they can build real skills and connect to jobs. And that will particularly help the long-term unemployed.""","NEW: Obama stresses ""fairness,"" while admitting ""we've got more work to do""

"(Parenting.com) -- When your toddler is hurt and screaming and emotions are bubbling over, it can be hard to tell if a situation is a true emergency, something that can be treated in your doctor's office or an issue you can handle at home. ""It's always better to call the pediatrician before going to the ER for anything but life-threatening emergencies,"" says Lara Zibners M.D., a pediatric ER doctor and author of ""If Your Kid Eats This Book, Everything Will Still Be Okay."" We spoke to pediatric ER doctors about the most common accidents and whether your child's doctor will deal with the issue over the phone, have you come into the office or call the ER to alert them that your child is on the way. What if your baby pulls up on the coffee table and then yanks a mug of hot tea on herself? Head to the ER if the burn covers a large part of her body; if it's on her face, hands, feet or genitals; or if it's a third-degree burn, which is pretty unlikely from a hot beverage. Otherwise, treat her at home and act fast. Since the first thing to do is get the hot liquid off the body, Dr. Zibners recommends removing the wet clothing and plunking her into a cool shower. ""If it's only a small part of the hand or arm that's been burned,"" she says, ""running cool water over the limb in the sink for 10 to 15 minutes or until the pain subsides will stop further injury and provide immediate pain relief."" Keep the area in water until it's cool to the touch, then treat the burn. At-home burn basics . If she has a first-degree burn (the skin is red), follow these tips: . DO: After the burn has cooled, cover it loosely with a dry bandage or clean cloth. DON'T: Apply ointments (or butter). This could cause infection or trap heat and make the burn deeper. Do not break any blisters. This could allow bacteria into the wound. What if your toddler topples off his changing table? The goose egg is huge, and he's hysterical. Head to the ER? For kids older than 12 months, you can take a watch-and-wait approach. Dr. Zibners says most kids who bump their heads are fine, and the size of the bump rarely has anything to do with the extent of the injury. There are loads of blood vessels in the head and face, so the swelling can be dramatic. Keep an eye on him for the next few hours to make sure he doesn't limp or favor one arm, vomit or become unusually sleepy or especially irritable. If you see any of these signs, call the doctor as they could mean something more serious. And, of course, if your child is motionless or unconscious or refuses to move after his fall, call an ambulance right away. The exception: Dr. Zibners says any child under a year of age who experiences more than a minor bump should always be checked out by a physician because injuries are harder to detect when the patient can't talk. Parenting.com: How to decode that strange rash . Diaper duty . The American Academy of Pediatrics offers these guidelines for safe diaper changing: . - Choose a changing pad with a concave middle to keep baby in place. - Always buckle the safety strap. - Keep diapering supplies within your reach (but out of baby's). What if another kid bites your baby and the skin is broken? Call your pediatrician right away. She may decide to send you to the ER, depending on the location of the bite and its appearance. (She might prescribe an oral antibiotic.) Otherwise, wash the wound immediately and thoroughly with soap and warm water and then apply an antibiotic ointment and bandage. ""Human bites are among the dirtiest of all wounds due to bacteria normally found in the human mouth,"" says Karen Frush M.D., a pediatric emergency room doctor and chief patient safety officer at Duke University Health System in Durham, North Carolina. ""Thoroughly washing the skin with soap and water is the best thing a parent can do to effectively reduce the bacteria load found in the wound."" Parenting.com: How gross is it? Your germiest situations analyzed . What if someone sideswipes your car? Your child is strapped into his safety seat, but he's upset and crying. Head to the ER? Only if he doesn't calm down after a reasonable amount of time, say 15 or 20 minutes. ""With children age 5 and under who are properly restrained in an age-appropriate car seat, the likelihood of injury is small in a non-or low-impact situation,"" says Dr. Frush. But if your child won't stop crying, bring him to the emergency room. ""That may mean he was subjected to unusual force, and a doctor can figure out if there are any injuries,"" she adds. Generally, though, if your child is moving his arms and legs, the best thing to do is remove him from his car seat, try to calm him and make sure he's OK. Warning signs . Sometimes symptoms take a few hours to appear. Call the doctor if you notice these signs: . - Blood in his urine (which could be a result of injury to the upper or lower urinary tract). - Bruising over his chest or belly from the straps. - Refusing to move or turn his head. - Refusing to bear weight. What if your toddler falls, bites her tongue and it's bleeding buckets? Head to the ER? Only if it's still bleeding after 10 or 15 minutes of applying direct pressure with a clean washcloth. The tongue is full of blood vessels, so it'll bleed a lot, which may scare her (and you!). ""With young children [applying direct pressure] is often very difficult, so it may be helpful to encourage her to suck on an ice pop, which can also provide pressure on the tongue and sometimes help stop the bleeding,"" says Dr. Frush. She adds that tongues usually heal nicely and it's very rare a child will lose enough blood from a tongue injury to become anemic. Parenting.com: 9 pediatric emergency essentials . To treat a tongue bite . DO: Dampen a clean washcloth with cool water, seat your child on your lap, then press the washcloth over the injured area of the tongue. Feed her cold foods, such as frozen yogurt. DON'T: Give your baby any acidic or salty foods while her tongue is healing because it will sting and make the pain worse.

"(CNN) -- A leading figure in French President Nicolas Sarkozy's party, the UMP, has dismissed any suggestion that ex-International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn was set up when he was arrested on charges of sexual assault in New York in May. ""To imagine that what would have happened to Mr. Strauss-Kahn would be the object of some sort of complicity from the UMP, it seems too hard to believe,"" said Jean-Francois Cope, secretary-general of the UMP party. Charges against Strauss-Kahn were dropped in August after questions were raised over the credibility of his accuser, hotel maid Nafissatou Diallo. However, the scandal ended both his career at the IMF and any hope of the leading Socialist politician challenging Sarkozy in next year's presidential election. Now an article in the New York Review of Books says Strauss-Kahn suspected a cellphone that disappeared just before his arrest had earlier been hacked. It also describes CCTV footage showing employees of the Sofitel hotel appearing to celebrate after the maid reported the alleged attack. A female friend of Strauss-Kahn allegedly warned him that an email he had sent had been read at UMP offices in Paris. If this was the case it meant, according to the New York Review of Books, ""he had reason to suspect he might be under electronic surveillance in New York. He had already been warned by a friend in the French diplomatic corps that an effort would be made to embarrass him with a scandal. The warning that his BlackBerry might have been hacked was therefore all the more alarming."" The author of the New York Review of Books story, Edward Epstein, told Agence-France Presse: ""I didn't say it was a political conspiracy but I would say that people wanted to find evidence of an indiscretion of his that could derail either his (French presidential) candidacy or even (his work at) the IMF."" One of Strauss-Kahn's lawyers, William Taylor, also told the news agency his client was possibly ""the target of a deliberate effort to destroy him as a political force."" However, Taylor did not say exactly who might be to blame. In France, right-wing politicians described the entire story as pure fantasy. ""For me, if there are facts, if there is clear evidence, of course, it goes without saying that conclusions will have to be drawn,"" said the UMP's Cope. ""As long as they are only rumors, gossip, allegations on the basis of anonymous testimony, which we know absolutely nothing about, you can understand that we remain a little more reserved and certainly not fooled."" In a television interview following his return to Paris, Strauss-Kahn confessed to a ""moral weakness"" and an ""inappropriate relationship"" with Diallo, but denied any violence or aggression. Strauss-Kahn still faces a civil suit from Diallo in New York, but he has asked a judge to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing his job gave him immunity from civil cases. The New York hotel where the alleged incident was reported also dismissed the story as ""inaccurate and speculative."" The Sofitel hotel chain released a statement saying: ""The article states that two Sofitel employees were seen 'celebrating' on tape for three minutes.

"(CNN) -- Champions League newcomers Manchester City are still waiting for their first win in the competition as a double from Mario Gomez gave in-form Bayern Munich a 2-0 Group A victory at the Allianz Arena. Bayern went into the match on the back of nine successive victories and they always looked dangerous in the first half, with Bastian Schweinsteiger volleying over the crossbar from close range in the 36th minute. However, the home side took the lead just two minutes later when goalkeeper Joe Hart did superbly to keep out shots from Frank Ribery and Thomas Mueller, but Gomez was on hand to stab home from three meters out. And the same player added a second goal on the stroke of half-time when Daniel Van Buyten's header was wonderfully saved by Hart, only for Gomez to be on hand again from close range. City could find no response after the break, and a bad night for them was made worse when manager Roberto Mancini later confirmed that former captain Carlos Tevez refused to come onto the pitch in the second half after being named only as a substitute. An angry Mancini told reporters: ""I asked him to go on and help the team. We have 11 players -- maybe he was disappointed because he didn't play from the start. If I have my way he will be out of the club."" The result leaves Bayern top of the table with a maximum six points from their two games, with Napoli second on four points after the Italian side beat Villarreal 2-0 in Naples. They opened the scoring in the 14th minute when Marek Hamsik chested down Ezequiel Lavezzi's cross at the back post, before firing home with his left foot. And Edinson Cavani added a second from the penalty spot just three minutes later after Lavezzi was fouled by Gonzalo Rodriguez in the area. Big-spending City, who are joint top of the English Premier League with five wins and a draw from their six games so far, are back in third with just a single point following their opening home draw against Napoli, while Spanish side Villarreal are bottom of the group without a point, or a goal, so far. Meanwhile, 2010 champions Inter Milan made it two wins out of two under new coach Claudio Ranieri with a thrilling 3-2 Group B victory at CSKA Moscow. Ranieri replaced Gian Piero Gasperini last week, and began his San Siro tenure with a 3-1 Serie A win at Bologna over the weekend. And Inter showed they had got their shock opening 1-0 defeat by Trabzonspor out of their system, by repelling a CSKA fightback to secure their first victory in the tournament. Brazilian defender Lucio fired Inter ahead from the edge of the box after just six minutes and the Italian side doubled their lead midway through the half, when Giampaolo Pazzini netted from close range after fine work from Yuto Nagatomo. However, the Russian side pulled a goal back on the stroke of half-time with a well-placed Alan Dzagoev free-kick and Brazilian Vagner Love levelled with 13 minutes remaining with a low drive. But, just a minute later, Mauro Zarate converted from Esteban Cambiasso's pass to give Inter a vital victory. The other group match saw Trabzonspor and Lille share a 1-1 draw in Turkey. Moussa Sow opened the scoring for the French side when he converted Eden Hazard's pass from a tight angle, but the home side earned a draw in the 75th minute when Gustavo Colman scored from the penalty spot after Mathieu Debuchy handled in the area. The result sees Trabzonspor top the group with four points, ahead of Inter on three, Lille on two and CSKA Moscow on a single point. Premier League leaders Manchester United needed a last-gasp Ashley Young goal to rescue a 3-3 Group C draw at home to Swiss side Basel, in a thrilling match that saw United squander a comfortable two-goal lead. United took a 16th minute lead when Danny Welbeck, in for the injured Wayne Rooney, was left unmarked in the area to score off the post, and the young England international added his second just a minute later when side-footing home a Ryan Giggs pass. But United took their foot off the gas and Basel pulled a goal back when Fabian Frei lashed home in the 58th minute after the United defense were slow to clear a corner. And, just two minutes later, Basel drew level when Frei's right-wing cross was superbly headed home by his namesake Alex Frei. Basel looked to have stolen a famous victory when they went ahead in the 75th minute after Antonio Valencia fouled Marco Streller in the area and Alex Frei scored the resulting penalty. But Young's late header from Nani's cross rescued a point for United, although they surrendered their 20-match winning run at Old Trafford in all competitions. Benfica beat Otelul Galati 1-0 in Romania in the other group game, which leaves Basel and Benfica level on top of the group on four points, with Manchester United third on two points after drawing their opening two matches. Real Madrid are top of Group D with a maximum six points from their two matches, after a 3-0 win over Ajax at the Bernabeu. Cristiano Ronaldo opened the scoring in the 25th minute when he converted a fine flowing move that saw five players involved. And the Spanish giants doubled their lead four minutes before the break when Kaka fired home a left-foot shot into the bottom corner of the net from Ronaldo's pass. The home side secured the points early in the second half when Kaka found Karim Benzema, who found the net from 10 yards out. Lyon are second in the table with four points after they beat Dinamo Zagreb 2-0 at the Stade de Gerland in their 100th Champions League game. Bafetimbi Gomis opened the scoring with a sublime chip and Bakary Kone sealed the points from close range. Ajax are third in the group with a single point, while Zagreb are bottom after losing their opening two matches.","Bayern Munich defeat Manchester City 2-0 in Champions League Group A .

"(CNN) -- This weekend some of the world's highest-paid sportswomen will battle for supremacy in Ireland, with the most prestigious team prize in their sport up for grabs. Golf's Solheim Cup is the female equivalent of the Ryder Cup, but it has yet to garner such a big reputation, despite a rich history and intense competition over the years. With this in mind, CNN gives the lowdown on a great sporting event that deserves your attention... From humble beginnings: . To trace the origins of the competition, we need to go back to 1959 and a garage in Redwood City, California. It was in this garage that a 48-year-old Norwegian engineer and golf lover, fed up with the putters he was using to play the game, decided to use his in-depth knowledge of science to manufacturer his own putters by hand. From these humble beginnings, the world famous PING brand of golfing equipment was born. That man was Karsten Solheim and it was he, alongside his son John and the U.S. and European ladies golf tours , who developed the concept of a women's team event between the two continents. The inaugural tournament, bearing Solheim's name, was held in 1990 at the Lake Nona club in Florida. Two teams of eight players faced each other, with the American side running out comfortable winners 11 1/2 to 4 1/2. In 1996 the tournament was increased to 12 players per side, a number that stands to this day and it has become the leading team event in women's golf, with players earning their place either through their own tour money lists, or as a captain's pick -- exactly the same as in the men's Ryder Cup. There have been 11 tournaments in total, with the United States leading 8-3, but the European team have not won any of the six competitions played on American soil. The football-loving legend: . No look at the Solheim Cup can be taken without mentioning Laura Davies. Quite astonishingly, the Englishwoman, who turns 48 next month, has appeared in all 11 previous tournaments and, once again, she is a member of the European team at Kileen Castle. Davies is a phenomenon in women's golf. As well as her achievements on the course -- which include winning four majors amongst her 81 victories -- she has been a flag-bearer for promoting the game, most notably when, in 2004, she became the first woman to compete on the men's European Tour. Davies is sports daft and is a keen racehorse owner as well as an avid follower of Liverpool Football Club. However, her love of football got her into trouble with tournament organizers in the 1996 Evian Masters, when she was fined for watching a match on a portable TV during the final round of that tournament. It didn't seem to hamper her game -- she won that particular tournament by four strokes! Swedish legend Annika Sorenstam appeared in eight Solheim Cups, winning 22 of her 37 matches, while compatriot Sophie Gustafson, another member of the current side, and European captain Alison Nicholas have also starred in eight tournaments. As for the Americans, you have to look hard to find a bigger legend than Juli Inkster. Despite reaching the age of 51 to become the oldest-ever competitior, the Californian is once again facing the European side this year, her ninth appearance in the event. Breaking the mould: . The Solheim Cup has never really seen a player like Christina Kim before. Not only is the 27-year-old Californian a lucky charm for the United States, appearing in the winning teams of 2005 and 2009 -- claiming five out of eight points in the process -- her infectious personality, undiluted enthusiasm, larger-than-life character and wacky dress sense has been a highlight of recent competitions. Kim is known for her bawdy sense of humor and occasional bouts of bad language that occasionally land her in hot water with golfing authorities. Describing her fist-pumping celebrations in the 2009 Solheim Cup, former LPGA star Dottie Pepper wrote in a column for Sports Illustrated: ""I know Christina Kim loves the galleries and is a ham, but she should be a little more respectful of the game. In the NFL, she would have been given 18 excessive celebration penalties."" Despite becoming the youngest-ever player to reach $1 million in career earnings, Kim has not won on the LPGA Tour since 2005 and last year her autobiography, ""Swinging from My Heels: Confessions of an LPGA Star"", was released to critical acclaim. Chaos and controversy: . Don't be deceived by the genteel nature of women's golf. The passion and will-to-win is as high as the men, but that spilled over into acrimonious scenes in 2003. The Barseback Golf and Country Club in Malmo, Sweden provided the setting for the eighth Solheim Cup and the first to be played away from either the United States or Great Britain. Scotland's Catriona Matthew secured victory for Europe on the 17th green, resulting in wild scenes of celebration. However, there were still quite a few singles matches still out on the course, including Norway's Suzann Pettersen against American Cristie Kerr. An excited Pettersen incurred Kerr's wrath by encouraging the crowd to make more noise in celebration as Kerr was about to putt on the 15th green. Kerr missed the putt and Pettersen won the hole. But, sensing her opponent's annoyance, Pettersen turned to Kerr on the 16th green and conceded the match, before joining the European celebrations. The same thing happened between the aforementioned Laura Davies and opponent Meg Mallon on the 14th hole but, as the match was all square, the pair both walked up to the tournament referee to concede at the same time, causing confusion. The Beth Daniel-Mhairi McKay match also came to an abrupt end with the score in the balance resulting in American captain Patty Sheehan telling reporters: ""I have never seen that before. All of a sudden, everyone just quit. It wasn't quite right."" Trophy on trophy: . Appropriately enough, as the tournament is in Ireland this year, the Solheim Cup trophy is made of Waterford Crystal glass, which originates just down the coast from the Killeen Castle resort. The urn-shaped trophy is 19 inches high, weighs more than 20 pounds and sits atop a wooden base. It was designed in 1990 for the inaugural tournament, but what makes it unusual is an engraving of the trophy on the trophy -- a panel on one side of the crystal is engraved with the Solheim Cup logo, and the logo incorporates the trophy itself. Following the men: . The competition is now a complete mirror image of the men's prestigious Ryder Cup, involving the same amount of players, format, points on offer and rivalry. But with the American team bidding for a fourth successive victory, the pressure is on for the Europeans to stop the rot, especially as another defeat will increase the clamor for the tournament to be changed to allow Asian players to compete. Asian golfers rule the roost in the women's game, with six of the world's top 10 players coming from the continent. In 1979, worried by the one-sided nature of the competition, Ryder Cup organizers decided that their biennial competition between the United States and Great Britain should be altered to make it Europe instead of Britain. The change completely altered the nature of the event, making it closer and more exciting. Another American victory, taking their overall lead to 9-3, will certainly intensify that particular debate.","The Solheim Cup takes place this weekend between Europe and United States .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- As Markus Winkelhock took to the sodden track of last week's European Grand Prix in Nuerburgring he went where one Winkelhock had been before, his father Manfred Winkelhock. Nico Rosberg (left) gets a pep talk from his world championship-winning father at this year's Monaco Grand Prix . Winkelhock junior's first grand prix -- and possibly last for some time, now that Christijan Albers' vacated Spyker seat has gone to Sakon Yamamoto -- will be talked about for years to come. His decision to run on extreme wet tires on lap three saw him leading the race by 33 seconds before the race was suspended for the second time. And, although his race ended with hydraulic failure, and future drives in Formula 1 are by no means certain, he joins the rare club of drivers who have led a grand prix on their first race. It was at Nuerburgring that his father Manfred Winkelhock raced his last Formula 1 grand prix. Never a contender -- he scored only two points from 47 starts -- he was nevertheless a popular driver with the home crowd. Sadly, eleven days after the 1985 German Grand Prix at Nuerburgring, Winkelhock was killed driving a Porsche 956 at a World Sportscar event in Mosport Park, Canada. Manfred's brothers Joachim and Thomas Winkelhock were also racing drivers; Joachim entered seven grands prix in the 1989 season but did not pre-qualify, so didn't race. ""My father did his last F1 race at the Nuerburgring and now I'm doing my first,"" said Markus last Sunday, ""that is something special."" Underneath his Spyker overalls, Markus wore a chain around his neck, as he always does when racing. On it was the wedding ring belonging to the father who died when Markus when only five years old -- a good luck talisman given to him by his mother. Formula 1's history has many such tales of sons following fathers into racing careers -- and in some cases the second generation drivers lost their fathers at an early age. Fatalities have been so rare in F1 in the last two decades that it's easy to forget quite how dangerous an activity it once was. Canadian Jacques Villeneuve had celebrated his eleventh birthday a month before his father Gilles, the legendary Ferrari driver, died in practice before the 1982 Belgian Grand Prix at Zolder. Such was his status in Canada, that his remains were returned to his homeland aboard a jet of the Canadian Air Force, on the request of the government. Knowing the dangers inherent in the sport, Villeneuve junior entered F1 in 1996. He started his first race from pole position and just missed out on the top step of the podium to his Williams team-mate, Damon Hill. In his next season Villeneuve junior achieved what his father rightly should have done, he won the World Championship. Hill too was the son of a racing legend. Graham Hill was champion in 1962 and 1968. With the dashing demeanor, and pencil moustache, of a World War 2 flying ace, he projected an image of the true sporting Brit. But, behind the scenes, he was a tempestuous man who could be both vain and reckless. Graham Hill died in 1975, when Damon was 15. It is often assumed that the sons of famous drivers who follow their fathers into the sport are drifted into their seats on a wave of nepotism and inheritance. Not true of Damon, who had to work as a motorcycle courier in London to pay for his start in motor racing. Graham Hill didn't die racing. He died trying to land a Piper Aztek airplane in fog. The plane was not properly registered or insured and Hill died along with his five passengers (including Tony Brise, who was racing for Hill's F1 team at the time). The families of the bereaved had no choice but to sue the estate of Graham Hill for compensation. Another F1 champion to sire a racing son was American Mario Andretti. He won the 1978 world championship for Lotus and also having a successful career in the US oval circuits in both Champcar and NASCAR. His son Michael entered F1 in 1993, paired with Ayrton Senna at McLaren. But, despite his success in Champcar, Andretti junior failed to make an impression in Formula 1 and was replaced, after just 13 races, by Mika Hakkinen. He would be the last American to compete in F1 until the appearance of Scott Speed in 2006. The current F1 grid contains one F1-sibling and one F1-offspring. Ralf Schumacher, of course, is brother to seven-times world Champion Michael (and living proof that driving talent isn't necessarily inherited). And Williams driver Nico Rosberg is the son of Keke Rosberg, the Finnish driver who won the world championship for Williams in 1982. Three-time world champion Jack Brabham's son, David raced for Brabham and Simtek in 1990 and 1994 without ever scoring points. And two-time champion Emerson Fittipaldi's son Christian raced for three seasons in the early 1990s, scoring a total of 12 championship points. Are there other sons-of-champions waiting in the wings? Tomas Scheckter, son of Jody Scheckter the 1979 world champion, tested for Jaguar in 2001 but was fired. He now races in the A1GP series and looks an unlikely F1 contender. 1992 world champion Nigel Mansell has supported the racing careers of sons Leo and Greg, who have both raced in single-seat racing formulae but, again, without looking obvious F1 contenders (though Greg is only 19). And four-time world champion Alain Prost's son Nicolas has had some success in the feeder formulae but, at 25, is considered old compared with young blood such as Robert Kubica and Sebastian Vettel. Nelson Angelo Piquet, son of three-time championship winner, Nelson Piquet is a test driver for Renault.

"Khartoum, Sudan (CNN) -- South Sudan's government has gained control of a remote town that had been under attack by fighters from a rival tribe, the nation's information minister said Monday. Some of the thousands who fled into the bush have begun to return to Pibor, said Barnaba Benjamin, South Sudan's minister of information and broadcasting. Earlier Monday, a military official said that roughly 4,000 army and police reinforcements were on the way to Pibor after weekend attacks. The United Nations also said it sent a battalion of peacekeepers to Pibor last week amid reports that members of the Lou Nuer tribe were marching toward the town, home to the Murle tribe, after attacking the village of Lukangol. Ethnic tensions in the South Sudan state of Jonglei have flared as tribes fight over grazing lands and water rights, disagreements that have dissolved into cattle raids and abduction of women and children. Fighters first struck Pibor on Saturday, attacking a portion that was out of the reach of U.N. peacekeepers, said Col. Philip Auger of the South Sudan army. Benjamin said there were no casualties and no direct confrontation between the two tribes there, because most of the Murle had fled when they heard the Lou Nuer were approaching. The nonprofit group Medecins sans Frontieres, also known as Doctors Without Borders, was still trying Monday to reach 117 of its 130 aid workers who fled into the bush along with the populations of Pibor and Lukangol before the attack, said Sarathy Rajendran, head of the group's South Sudan mission. Rajendran said the organization was afraid for its workers' safety and ""very concerned"" for the people of Pibor and Lukangol. ""We believe tens of thousands are currently displaced without access to water, food and health care,"" he said. ""The situation is tense. We don't know what is happening on the ground, so we are monitoring the situation."" The nonprofit's clinic in Lukangol was ""burned and looted,"" spokeswoman Emily Linendoll said, adding that its Pibor clinic ""has been targeted."" The attack on Pibor follows reports last week that Lou Nuer fighters raided Lukangol, burning it to the ground and forcing thousands to flee toward Pibor. At least 50,000 people have fled the violence in the state that began last year, said Quade Hermann, chief of radio at Radio Miraya, a U.N.-backed radio station in South Sudan. She similarly said that the town of Pibor is secure now, though the situation there remains fluid. The people who fled remain scattered, and the United Nations is working on a plan for how to distribute humanitarian aid, Hermann said. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon last week urged the groups to work with the government of South Sudan to find solutions. South Sudan's vice president, Riek Machar, is leading an initiative to bridge the differences between the Lou Nuer and Murle tribes, including encouraging the armed groups to disband and go home, the United Nations has said. The violence in Jonglei state is the latest to rock South Sudan, which officially gained its statehood in July after separating from the north.","NEW: At least 50,000 people are said to have fled from the violence in Jonglei .

"(CNN) -- Fourteen times in nine years, Sgt. 1st Class Kristoffer Domeij had left his family behind and headed out on deployment as an Army Ranger, taking part in hundreds of combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, all before his 30th birthday. His most recent tour turned out to be his last. The veteran soldier's death rattled his commanders, as well as those in his native San Diego. His former football coach, Jeff Carpenter, remembered Domeij as diligent, funny, passionate and team-oriented. ""I told my classes that I was incredibly sad to begin with and incredibly angry,"" said Carpenter, who besides being an assistant coach the past 18 years is also a social sciences teacher at Rancho Bernardo High School. ""Just the fact that it happened to someone like him -- it's hard."" Domeij, 1st Lt. Ashley White and Pvt. 1st Class Christopher Horns all died Saturday in Kandahar province when an improvised explosive device blew up near their assault force, according to a U.S. Army Special Operations Command news release. The trio's death is far from unprecedented: According to CNN's count, based on U.S. military reports, there have been 1,811 U.S. troops killed during Operation Enduring Freedom, the U.S.-led mission in Afghanistan that began in October 2001. Each person, each death, is unique. In Domeij's case, that translates to a man whom his unit commander described as ""irreplaceable"" -- on the battlefield and in life. ""He was one of those men who known by all as much for his humor, enthusiasm and loyal friendship as he was for his unparalleled skill and bravery under fire,"" said Lt. Col. David Hodne, head of the 75th Ranger Regiment's 2nd battalion. ""This was a Ranger you wanted at your side when the chips were down."" Domeij distinguished himself as a person as much as he did as a player while in high school, his former coach recalled. ""He was just a great kid,"" Carpenter said, describing his great sense of humor and engaging personality. ""And we knew, as coaches, that no matter what, this was a kid who was going to play hard and (all) out."" Carpenter said he wasn't surprised when Domeij told him he was going to enlist. ""It made all the sense in the world,"" the coach said, given Domeij's proven dedication to and ability to thrive as a member of a team. So Domeij joined the Army in July, a few months after graduating high school and not long before the September 11 terrorist attacks. Nine months later, he became part of the Ranger regiment. Domeij was based at that unit's headquarters at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state, where his role was as a joint terminal attack controller. The person in this position often advances into harm's way, directing allied combat aircraft on where and when to strike. His regiment's commander, Col. Mark Odom, called Domeij ""technically and tactically competent"" as well as critically important. ""His ability to employ fire support platforms made him a game-changer on the battlefield -- an operator who, in real terms, had the value of an entire strike force on the battlefield,"" Odom said in the news release. The military culture is very much ingrained in the Southern California culture in which Domeij grew up. Much of the Pacific fleet is based there at U.S. Naval Base San Diego. A large Marine base at Camp Pendleton is about 30 miles northwest of Rancho Bernardo High, with the famed Marine Corps Air Station Miramar about 11 miles south. The parents of many of that high school's students -- whose enrollment was about 3,000 when Domeij attended -- are in the military, Carpenter notes. Yet while multiple students enlist each year, Domeij's death is the first his coach can recall since Rancho Bernardo opened in 1990. Carpenter said he'd kept in touch with his former player since graduation, knowing full well that was in Special Operations and in harm's way. But he said neither he nor were others in the community was prepared for the news. ""This was really hard,"" Carpenter said. ""I don't know if we knew how to deal with it."" The thousands of veterans who live in the area know the dangers and trauma of war all too well. That's one reason why they have made it a priority to look out for those now serving overseas, Frank Csaszar said Friday from VFW Post 3788 in San Diego. ""The returning troops coming back home the current wars, we give them a group hug,"" said Csaszar, an Army veteran who served during the Vietnam War. ""We're right there, and we support them."" In Domeij's case, such support now will be extended to his surviving family. He leaves behind his wife, Sarah, and daughters Mikajasa and Aaliyah, both of whom now live in Lacey, Washington. He is also survived by his mother, Scoti Domeij of Colorado Springs, Colorado, and his brother, Kyle Domeij of San Diego. According to Carpenter, Domeij never relished the spotlight and probably would not want it now, upon his death. But as with other troops who have died in combat, Carpenter said, the recognition is well-deserved. ""Some of this attention would probably bother (Domeij), because he felt he was a guy doing his job, which he believed in,"" the coach said. ""But these guys are heroes.""","NEW: Coach says Kristoffer Domeij's death has been hard on community .

"Las Vegas (CNN) -- President Barack Obama traveled to Las Vegas on Monday to launch a Western trip that mixes campaigning with presidential business -- and an appearance on ""The Tonight Show."" After a campaign event at The Bellagio hotel and casino Monday afternoon, Obama met with homeowners at a private residence to announce new efforts to help homeowners with refinancing. The government's Home Affordable Refinance Program will be changed to make it easier for homeowners to capitalize on current low interest rates by refinancing old, high-interest mortgages. The new rules will allow homeowners who owe more than 125% of the market value of their homes to get the new loans. ""So let me just give you an example. If you've got a $250,000 mortgage at 6 percent interest rates, but the value of your home has fallen below $200,000, right now you can't refinance. You're ineligible,"" Obama said, according to a copy of his remarks released by the White House. ""But that's going to change. If you meet certain requirements, you will have the chance to refinance at lower rates, which could save you hundreds of dollars a month, and thousands of dollars a year on mortgage payments."" In addition, Obama told the gathering,""there are going to be lower closing costs, and certain refinancing fees will be eliminated -- fees that can sometimes cancel out the benefits of refinancing altogether."" The changes also will allow consumers to shop around for better rates beyond their original lenders, he said. Learn why the program probably won't help the real estate market . The president then traveled to Los Angeles, where he was expected to deliver remarks at two more campaign events. On Tuesday, Obama will tape an appearance on ""The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,"" according to the White House. The last time the president appeared on the show, in March 2009, he caused controversy by attempting to poke fun at his poor bowling skills -- evident during a 2008 campaign stop. He told Leno he bowled 129 in the White House bowling alley and said his bowling skills were ""like Special Olympics or something."" Before the show aired, the president called Special Olympics Chairman Tim Shriver to apologize, White House officials said, and stress his intention was not to humiliate the disabled. Shriver called Obama's apology ""sincere and heartfelt,"" but noted in a written response, ""This is a teachable moment for our country."" After the ""Tonight Show"" taping, Obama will travel to San Francisco for a fundraiser, according to the White House. On Tuesday night, he will be in Denver to push his jobs agenda. Other private fundraisers will also be sprinkled in, officials said. A Democratic official estimates the campaign will haul in more than $4 million from six fundraisers in three states. It's the second time in less than a month that Obama has headed west to push for jobs and raise campaign cash. A senior campaign official noted the importance of spending time in the region, saying the ""campaign has already established an extensive operation in Western states."" And they expect to make ""heavy investments there."" The official singled out Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico and Arizona, where the campaign has offices and field staff. In 2008 Obama won decisively in Nevada, Colorado and New Mexico, but lost to Republican John McCain in McCain's home state of Arizona. This time around the economy remains under heavy downward pressure despite efforts by the Obama administration to turn things around. In Nevada, home prices have plummeted by 53% since the peak, and according to online real estate site Zillow, 85% of the state's homeowners owe more than their homes are worth. At his fundraiser at the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas Monday, the president acknowledged that ""things are tough right now,"" but he reminded the audience of some 300 supporters of his accomplishments. ""AsÂ tough as things are right now, weÂ were able to stabilize this economy and make sure it didn't go into a great depression,"" the president said. While the campaign is targeting key Western states, officials realize every vote will be critical. ""Our goal in 2011 is to build the biggest organization possible to compete on the widest playing field possible in 2012,"" the campaign official said. CNN's Alex Mooney, Dan Lothian, Lesa Jansen and Jessica Yellin contributed to this report.","Obama announces changes in the Home Affordable Refinance Program .

"(CNN) -- Americans' clicking fingers must be sore. Analysts have begun providing their final tallies for Cyber Monday sales, which found that people piled more in their virtual shopping carts than ever before. Monday was the highest-grossing online shopping day in U.S. history, with spending reaching $1.25 billion, according to market research firm comScore. That's up 22% from the previous record, which was last year's Cyber Monday. Online shopping for the month of November has hit $15 billion, a 15% increase compared to last year, comScore says. Discounting efforts by some online retailers, including Amazon.com and Apple, in the hopes of bringing some of the mall's Black Friday magic to the Web appear to have paid off. With a 26% jump over last year, the day after Thanksgiving saw the highest increase in spending compared to 2010 than any other period in November, according to comScore. However, online spending on Cyber Monday still outpaced Black Friday by a healthy margin, the research says. Even without significantly slashing prices, some retailers saw a jump in customers coming to their websites on Monday. For example, Sony saw a dramatic increase in traffic and sales on Monday. Sony Electronics President Phil Molyneux said many Americans may have overcome some concerns about the struggling economy. ""There's a pent-up demand from consumers,"" Molyneux told a roomful of reporters in San Francisco on Tuesday. ""There's a demand, and consumers need to feel that they can spend again."" They seem to be feeling it, and their digital wallets are feeling lighter.","ComScore: Cyber Monday was the biggest U.S. online shopping day ever .

"DUBLIN, Ireland (CNN) -- Michael D. Higgins, a 70-year-old poet and politician, was elected Ireland's new president on Saturday. Considered an elder statesman, the Irish Labour Party candidate-turned-president elect is a former government minister. He is to be Ireland's ninth head of state and is scheduled to be inaugurated on November 11, one day after President Mary McAleese leaves office. McAleese has been head of state 14 years, completing two seven-year terms. The other six candidates -- including former Irish Republican Army commander Martin McGuinness -- have all conceded defeat. McGuinness's campaign had been dogged by questions about his past ties to the IRA, an armed group that fought against British authorities in Northern Ireland but has since renounced violence. He had been consistently third in opinion polls, while businessman and reality TV star Sean Gallagher had been vying alongside Higgins for the top spot. Critics blamed Gallagher's performance in the country's final televised debate for his collapse in the polls. McGuinness is expected to return to his role as Northern Ireland's deputy first minister. The long counting process started Friday with Higgins confirmed as the winner late Saturday.","Michael D. Higgins is elected Ireland's new president .

"(Rolling Stone) -- Maybe you thought since Adam Sandler is playing boy-and-girl twins in ""Jack and Jill"" that the movie would be double the fun. Ha! On a scale of 1 to 10 on the laugh meter, ""Jack and Jill"" is a negative 10. A total bust, a stupefyingly unfunny and shamelessly lazy farce packed with cringe-worthy jokes and overt product placement. L.A. ad exec Jack Sadelstein (Sandler the guy) is gritting his teeth over a holiday visit from his loudmouthed, overweight twin Jill (Sandler in drag, showing an unfailing grasp of the obvious). The siblings pick at each other relentlessly between Jill's bouts with farting and dropping chimichanga bombs. No peace, even with the help of Jack's peacemaker wife (Katie Holmes looks so trapped in this thankless role you ache to save her). It's odious to watch the movie make fun of Jill's looks, weight, and flatulence problems only to switch gears into gooey sentiment at the end and tell us we should love her. ""Jack and Jill"" wants to have its hypocrisy and eat it too. Look, I'm not a Sandler hater. He was terrific in Judd Apatow's ""Funny People"" and Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Punch-Drunk Love."" And I still treasure fun memories of ""Billy Madison"" and ""Happy Gilmore,"" made before Sandler turned cynical and contemptuous of his audience. ""Jack and Jill"" plays like the kind of crap Sandler's comedian character skewered in ""Funny People."" The plot is a stew of half-baked ideas that quickly turns rancid. Jack has problems at work; his company will go under if he can't persuade Al Pacino to play himself in a Dunkin' Donuts commercial. Watching the Oscar winner bust a move and freestyle rap while he extols the virtues of sipping a Dunkachinno is to witness desperation incarnate. Sandler and director Dennis Dugan must have something on ""The Godfather"" to make him lower himself to these depths. ""Burn it,"" says Pacino after watching the commercial Sandler creates. ""No one must ever see this."" The same goes for the movie. Rolling Stone rating: Zero stars . See the full article at RollingStone.com.

"Abidjan, Ivory Coast (CNN) -- Former Ivory Coast President Laurent Gbagbo arrived Wednesday at the International Criminal Court in The Hague to stand trial for his role in his country's post-election violence that killed thousands. ""It is exactly a year since the presidential election that led to one of the worst episodes of violence Cote d'Ivoire has ever known,"" said Luis Moreno-Ocampo, the court's chief prosecutor, using the French name for the country. ""In December last year, we put Mr. Gbagbo and the others on notice. Today, we are following up."" The former president's initial appearance is scheduled for Monday, the ICC announced. Gbagbo, 66, was flown out of the northern Ivoirian city of Khorogo, where he had been under house arrest, on an Ivoirian government airplane Tuesday evening, said his adviser, Toussaint Alain. Alain called it an illegal transfer. ""The international court has taken an illegal action. This is a political decision rather than a decision of justice,"" Alain said. The action comes a week before parliamentary elections are scheduled to be held in Ivory Coast. Three political parties in an umbrella coalition (CNRD) with Gbagbo's Front Populaire Ivoirien issued a statement saying they would boycott the elections as a result of Gbagbo's transfer. Last month, Moreno-Ocampo arrived in Ivory Coast to meet with government and opposition leaders and began an inquiry into the West African nation's post-election violence. In his application to the judges for authorization to investigate possible war crimes and crimes against humanity, Moreno-Ocampo cited sources who said at least 3,000 people were killed, 72 people disappeared and 520 others were subject to arbitrary arrest and detentions since the November 28, 2010, election that resulted in the violence. Gbagbo, the incumbent, refused to cede power even though challenger Alassane Ouattara was internationally recognized as the winner. Months of bloodshed ensued. The political stalemate was settled by Gbagbo's capture in April by forces loyal to his rival, and he has been detained in the north of Ivory Coast. Gbagbo refused to accept the results of U.N.-certified elections. Human Rights Watch issued a statement saying Gbagbo is ""the first former head of state taken into custody by the ICC."" President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan and the late Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi have also been subject to ICC arrest warrants, but al-Bashir has not come into ICC custody, nor did Gadhafi, who was killed in October during Libya's revolution, Human Rights Watch said. ""The ICC is playing its part to show that even those at the highest levels of power cannot escape justice when implicated in grave crimes,"" Elise Keppler, senior international justice counsel at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. The court charged Gbagbo with four counts of crimes against humanity, ""namely murder, rape and other forms of sexual violence, persecution and other inhuman acts."" ""This is a big day for the victims of (Ivory Coast's) horrific post-election violence,"" Keppler said. ""That Laurent Gbagbo now has to answer to the court sends a strong message to Ivoirian political and military leaders that no one should be above the law."" CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","NEW: The former president's initial court appearance is scheduled for Monday .

"(CNN) -- The St. Louis Cardinals finished their improbable run Friday night with a convincing 6-2 win, beating the Texas Rangers and giving the franchise another World Series championship. Instead of the furious comebacks the Cards have been known for this year, the Cards grabbed a commanding lead in the fifth inning Friday and held on. ""We got it. It is unbelievable,"" outfielder Allen Craig said. ""This is an unbelievable group of guys. I am just glad to be a part of this."" Craig, who caught the last out of the game, was more than a part of it. He hit a home run in the third inning of Friday's game and stole a home run from Ranger Nelson Cruz leaping over the wall to bring the ball back. Another one of the stars of Friday's game was Cardinals catcher Yadier Molina, who had two hits and knocked in two RBIs. Another St. Louis star was hurler Chris Carpenter, who continued his undefeated postseason run by stymieing the Rangers for six innings Friday. Rangers pitchers were plagued with wildness Friday and throughout the series. In the fifth inning, the Cardinals were able to get two runs and jump to a commanding 5 to 2 lead without getting a hit, capitalizing on Rangers' walks. The win gives the Cards their 11th World Series championship. The Cardinals last won the championship in 2006. Friday's win may have seemed a little melodramatic compared to the instant-classic World Series game Thursday, when the Cardinals displayed their never-say-die attitude. The Cardinals were pushed to within their last strike in the ninth and 10th innings only to come back and erase two-run deficits both times. They finished the comeback in the 11th inning beating the Rangers 10 to 9 on David Freese's walk-off home run. Freese was named the most valuable player of the series. ""This is a dream come true,"" Freese said. ""This is why you keep battling."" Cardinals Manager Tony La Russa said the fans, cheering and supporting, helped his team to the muster the strength to comeback so many times. ""It is amazing, incredible,"" La Russa said. ""This is for you, fans. Thank you so much."" Comebacks are nothing new for the Cards, who made a furious dash just to reach the postseason. The team erased a 10.5-game deficit with the Atlanta Braves in the last month of the regular season just to make it to the playoffs. They punctuated that comeback by taking the must-win last two games of the season and stealing the National League wild card from the Braves. Once in the playoffs, the Cards defeated division champs Milwaukee Brewers and Philadelphia Phillies. Both feats defied oddsmakers.","The St. Louis Cardinals win 6-2 in Game 7 .

"(CNN) -- The chaotic scene unfolded with flash-bang grenades, rubber bullets and clouds of smoke. Canisters whizzed through the air amid deafening booms. Marine Lance Cpl. Scott Olsen went down. ""Medic! Medic!"" someone yelled. Olsen, 24, had seen his share of war in two tours of Iraq as a Marine. He was lucky, returning home physically unscathed. But Tuesday evening, near the corner of 14th Avenue and Broadway in Oakland, California, Olsen went down. The video images went viral: streams of crimson flowing down Olsen's head, his black T-shirt adorned with a white dove of peace, the war veteran carried to a hospital. And with that, the Occupy movement had a face. ""We are all Scott Olsen,"" declared its website. ""It's ironic,"" said his uncle George Nygaard, that Olsen should be the poster child for this movement. Ironic, said Olsen's Marine buddy and current roommate Keith Shannon, that a young man who fought for American freedoms should be injured exercising those same freedoms at home. He was 14 at the time of the September 11 attacks and graduated in 2005 from Onalaska High School with the same sense of patriotism that drove so many young men and women to join the military. He was working at Lindy's Subs and Salads when he decided to enlist. Soon, he was in Twentynine Palms in the Mojave Desert for training and the next year on his way to war. Olsen deployed twice with the 3rd Battalion, 4th Marine Regiment to Iraq's Anbar province, site of some the war's fiercest battles. Shannon said they often encountered makeshift bombs in their 2006 tour during which 15 of their fellow Marines died. Nygaard said Olsen told him about a couple of close calls, one in which he rolled over a roadside bomb that somehow failed to detonate. Olsen had always been a quiet, shy kid, Nygaard said. A computer whiz, not a jock. And not the type of young man his friends had expected to become an activist. But war touched Olsen as it does almost everyone who comes that close. After his last tour of Iraq, he returned home with serious misgivings and gravitated to Nygaard, a former Marine himself who had returned from Vietnam feeling similarly. In small-town Wisconsin, uncle and nephew talked to each other about the larger issues of war. ""He came back thinking there were better ways to deal with things than war,"" Nygaard said. Olsen's parents, Nygaard said, didn't always understand the change in their son. But Nygaard felt an affinity for the young man. ""I am so much more proud of him now than when he was in (the Marine Corps), because he followed through on his convictions,"" Nygaard said. Those convictions led Olsen to Madison this year to join protests of a bill by Gov. Scott Walker to weaken organized labor in Wisconsin. ""Scott thought the workers were getting screwed,"" said Nygaard, who was on the streets with his nephew. This summer, Olsen's friend Shannon helped him get a job at OPSWAT, a technology firm in San Francisco. By then, Olsen had become deeply involved with Veterans for Peace and Iraq Veterans Against the War. At one event, he stood with a poster that read: ""32 veterans will try to commit suicide every day and 18 will succeed."" ""He worried deeply about his fellow brothers and sisters who are veterans,"" Nygaard said. That's what prompted him to join the Occupy movement, first in San Francisco and then across the bay in Oakland, Nygaard said. Olsen knew there were many veterans among America's down and out. For the past three weeks, he was working during the day and out all night at the Occupy protests, Shannon said. He came home only three or four times to the Daly City apartment the two shared -- mainly to do laundry. Still, the laid-back Olsen was never a screamer. He felt strongly about economic injustice and wanted to add his voice quietly to the fight. And so, Tuesday night, he was standing there, almost at parade rest, when he went down, witnesses said. He suffered a skull fracture and was in fair condition in the intensive care unit at Highland Hospital, a hospital spokesman said. Shannon and Nygaard said Olsen was conscious and communicating by writing on a notepad. Shannon said he has been told Olsen has asked to see him, but doctors have limited visitors. Olsen's parents were with him at the hospital. Meanwhile, Oakland police are investigating how Olsen was hurt. Protesters gathered for a vigil in his name. National outcry over police treatment of the protesters -- many others were injured or sickened by tear gas -- prompted Oakland Mayor Jean Quan to take responsibility for those who were hurt. And Scott Olsen became a household name. But back in Chaseburg, Wisconsin, Nygaard worried for his nephew. Concussions, he said, can come back to haunt you, even after you get over the bruises. A lot of veterans know that from Iraq and Afghanistan, where head injuries have been common. Only Olsen's luck ran out here, in America. Nygaard just hopes his nephew will recover to tell his own story. CNN's Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","Scott Olsen returned from two tours of Iraq without injury .

"London (CNN) -- Singer Charlotte Church on Monday blasted the News of the World tabloid for its decision to publish a lurid story about her father having an affair while her mother was getting treatment for mental illness. ""They knew how vulnerable she was and still printed a story like that, which is just horrific,"" she said. The former child star also spoke of her anger at finding out her phone may have been hacked by a private investigator working for the Rupert Murdoch tabloid. The investigator, Glenn Mulcaire, had details of her phone and those of her parents, friends and former boyfriends, Church said police had told her. She was testifying before a wide-ranging British government-backed inquiry into press ethics and practices in the country. Sparked by the revelation that News of the World tabloid hacked into the voice mail of a murdered 13-year-old girl in search of stories, the Leveson Inquiry has been hearing from high-profile figures for more than a week. Church described how upset she was at the leak of the news of her daughter's birth, the rifts it caused with her family and friends when she accused them of revealing the details, and her later guilt at realizing the source was probably hacking, not leaks from those close to her. And she said falsehoods published in the press were particularly damaging because readers believe there are rules to prevent that from happening, ""So if they see it in print, it must be true -- and that's not the case."" Former Tony Blair spokesman Alastair Campbell is due to testify later this week, but a written copy of his opening statement appears to have leaked online. Paul Staines, who blogs as Guido Fawkes, posted what he said was a copy of Campbell's testimony in which he speculates about the possibility that the Daily Mirror found out though phone hacking that Tony Blair's wife was pregnant. ""I think it is at least possible that this is how the stories got out,"" Campbell says in the statement published by Staines. Campbell said on Twitter Sunday he was ""genuinely shocked someone has seen fit to leak my statement to Leveson."" The Daily Mirror is not a Murdoch paper. Piers Morgan was editor of the paper at the time of Cherie Blair's pregnancy, and he now hosts the show ""Piers Morgan Tonight"" on CNN. Morgan, who has vigorously denied ordering phone hacking, is due to testify before the Leveson Inquiry at a later date yet to be determined. Celebrities who have already testified before the inquiry include ""Harry Potter"" author J.K. Rowling and ""G.I. Joe"" actress Sienna Miller, who both complained of being hounded by paparazzi. Actor Hugh Grant also appeared before the panel, and he implied that police leaked information to the tabloid press. He also accused the Mail on Sunday of hacking. Police investigating phone hacking by journalists say that about 5,800 people, including celebrities, crime victims, politicians and members of the royal family, were targets of the practice by journalists in search of stories. It involves illegally eavesdropping on voice mail by entering a PIN to access messages remotely.","NEW: People believe rules prevent falsehoods from being printed, Charlotte Church says .

"(CNN) -- Next time a friend of yours calls up asking for their spare key, they may be looking for a Facebook password. On Thursday, Facebook began testing a tool called Trusted Friends. It lets a user specify between three and five pals on the social network (no more, no less) who can be counted on to pass along a special code if the user somehow gets locked out of his or her account. It's essentially another way to regain access to your Facebook page if you forget your password. The option will show up on the ""account settings"" page for some of Facebook's 800 million users during the next few weeks, the company said in a statement. When someone who has enabled the feature is unable to login using the normal means, they can click ""forgot my password"" and request that keys be sent to their specified friends via Facebook message. The user must then retrieve all the codes, or keys, and enter them into fields on Facebook's password-recovery page to log back in, a Facebook spokeswoman said in an e-mail. This makes the process sort of like a scavenger hunt, although one with a less-than-exciting reward. The Trusted Friends feature will not be mandatory. It joins other account-recovery features such as the ubiquitous ""forgot my password"" and security questions, as well as less conventional methods, like identifying friends' faces in pictures or recovering passwords via text message. Facebook also began testing another security feature on Thursday for setting different passwords on each site that takes Facebook credentials.","Facebook has begun testing new security features .

"(CNN) -- English Premier League form side Tottenham are on the brink of going out of the Europa League after Greek outfit PAOK Salonika claimed a shock 2-1 Group A victory at White Hart Lane. Tottenham have been in superb form in recent weeks, winning nine of their last 10 league games to move up to third place in the table. However, their European form has not been as strong, and this month's 1-0 reverse at Rubin Kazan was followed by another defeat on Wednesday to leave Harry Redknapp's side needing PAOK to win their last game next month in order to help Tottenham achieve qualification through to the last 32. The visitors went ahead in the sixth minute when an unmarked Dimitris Salpingidis guided the ball home from Giorgos Georgiadis' right-wing cross. And PAOK doubled their lead seven minutes later when Stefanos Athanasiadis tapped home from close range after more suspect Spurs marking. The home side pulled one back seven minutes before the break when Luka Modric scored from the penalty spot after Konstantinos Stafylidis was dismissed for handball on the line. However, despite having a numerical advantage for the whole of the second half, Tottenham failed to find the goal they needed. The result means PAOK are top on 11 points and have qualified for the last 32 knockout stage. Russian side Rubin Kazan are second on 10 points after thrashing Shamrock Rovers 4-1 in the other group game. For Spurs to qualify, they will now need to win heavily at Shamrock in their final match, and hope Rubin Kazan are beaten at PAOK in the other tie. Also through to the last 32 are 2010 winners Atletico Madrid, after the Spanish side won 1-0 at Celtic in Group I thanks to a superb long-range strike from Turkish international Arda Turan on the half-hour mark. The other match between Rennes of France and Italians Udinese ended 0-0, a result that means Atletico have qualified with 10 points ahead of the final round of matches. Udinese are second on eight points and they will secure their place in the knockout round if they draw at home to Celtic in their final game, with the Scottish side needing a victory to progress. Group C is the only group where both qualifiers have now been decided, after PSV Eindhoven won 3-0 at Legia Warsaw. That result means both sides have gone through, on 13 points and nine points respectively. Romanians Rapid Bucharest needed to beat Israeli side Hapoel Tel-Aviv at home to retain any hope, but they were beaten 3-1. Another side to reach the knockout stage is Standard Liege, who saw off Germans Hannover 2-0 to make it three wins and two draws from their five Group B matches so far. The Belgian outfit are on 11 points, three ahead of Hannover, who need a point from their final match against Vorskla Poltava to also secure qualification. Ukrainian side Metalist Kharkov continued their impressive run of form in the competition, thumping Austria Vienna 4-1 to secure their qualification from Group G with 13 points from their five matches. Malmo and AZ Alkmaar drew 0-0 in the other match to leave Alkmaar needing to beat Kharkov in their final match to join their opponents in the last 32. However, there is all to play for in Group H, with any two of three teams still able to qualify. Last year's beaten finalists Sporting Braga beat Birmingham City 1-0, while a remarkable match in Slovenia saw Bruges of Belgium fight back from 3-0 down to win 4-3 in injury time against Maribor. That means Bruges and Braga are level on 10 points and they play each other in the final match. A draw there will see them both qualify with Birmingham, who are three points behind in third place, needing to beat Maribor in their final match and hoping the other game does not end in a draw. There was a suprise result in the English League Cup quarterfinals, where Manchester United were beaten 2-1 at home by Championship side Crystal Palace in extra time. That result means Palace now play fellow-second tier side Cardiff City in the semifinals, while Premier League giants Liverpool and Manchester City face each other in the second semifinal.","Tottenham on the brink of Europa League elimination after a 2-1 defeat by PAOK Salonika .

"(WIRED) -- Google's Maps team has made fantastic advances in surveying and mapping seemingly every square inch of navigable ground on the planet. But for mobile users, those maps have always stopped just short of indoor spaces -- until now. Google Maps 6.0 for Android launched Tuesday with a bold initiative: indoor mapping. Partnering at launch with a selection of businesses and public service structures, the new mobile Maps version allows users to see the entire layout of a mapped building, switch between floor plans if the structure has multiple levels, and locate indoor points of interest like retail stores, bathrooms and ATMs. Obviously, indoor mapping is only useful when the building you're navigating is big enough to warrant it. To this end, Google has partnered with more than 25 major businesses that handle large crowds on a regular basis -- major travel sites like San Francisco International and Chicago's O'Hare airports, as well as giant retailers like Macy's and Bloomingdale's. Considering the layers of thick concrete and steel holding up some of these buildings, it's been difficult for Google to get its location-aware technology up to snuff. ""GPS is unreliable and doesn't work well indoors,"" said Maps project manager Steve Lee in an interview. ""We used similar information to how we've implemented the navigation 'blue dot' feature in the past, and we've been able to improve the accuracy indoors, at an accuracy of about 5 to 10 meters."" While half of the initiative begins in U.S. structures, Google is simultaneously launching in Japan, covering Tokyo's massive underground subway network and retail shopping centers (an area where new visitors definitely need a map). While version 6.0 isn't covering U.S. transit, Lee says the Japanese transit coverage ""can give us a sense for what's in store for the future."" While it's just a beginning, Google has also launched a beta tool that allows businesses to upload their own floor plans to the Maps database. Slowly but surely, Google hopes to entice more businesses and major indoor areas of interest -- both small and large -- to opt in for indoor mapping. Of course, these are private spaces, not freely accessible public roads, so it's an initiative for the long haul.

"(CNN) -- The Arkansas weatherman found last week in a hot tub alongside a man's lifeless, naked body is hoping autopsy results and other evidence will soon clear his name, his lawyer said Monday. Mark Hampton said his client, Brett Cummins, resigned Friday from his position as a meteorologist at KARK, which is based in Little Rock. ""The station was getting continuing inquiries, and Brett thought it would be best if he resigned,"" Hampton said, adding that the resignation was done orally after his client contacted the station. In a statement on its website, KARK confirmed that Cummins' tenure at the station ended Friday afternoon. Authorities have not charged him, or anyone else, in the death of Dexter Paul Williams, 24. Christopher Barbour, 36, said he awoke Monday morning in his home outside Little Rock to find Williams' body at the bottom of an empty tub, his face blue and purple and a chain around his neck, a Maumelle Police Department report said. Cummins, 33, was asleep next to the corpse, whose head was lying behind the meteorologist's shoulder, Barbour told police, according to a report by Officer Gregory Roussie. The witness said he awakened Cummins, who screamed and ran to the living room, where he vomited next to the couch after noticing Williams' discolored face and cold skin. The previous night, Williams and Cummins arrived together at Barbour's house, Barbour told police. Once there, the three had drunk alcohol and snorted illegal narcotics, though Barbour could not identify the drugs, according to the report. Last week, Williams' family issued a statement through their lawyer Thomas Nichols that said, ""Dex had a very loving but trusting heart. Anyone who knew him would agree that he was easily influenced."" Hampton had identified Williams as Cummins' friend, but on Monday the lawyer said that -- heeding his advice -- the weatherman had not contacted the dead man's family. No arrests had been made, but an investigation is under way, Lt. Jim Hansard said last week. ""We don't have a crime -- yet,"" he said. ""That's part of the investigation."" Arkansas State Crime Laboratory Director Kermit Channell said Monday that Williams' autopsy examination ""should be finished up,"" anticipating that a final report will be ready ""in the next week or so."" After that, it will up to the local law enforcement agency overseeing the case -- the Maumelle Police Department -- to decide whether the autopsy results will remain confidential or be released to the public, Channell said. CNN's Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","Brett Cummins resigned Friday from his job as a meteorologist at KARK, his lawyer says .

"(CNN) -- Reports have surfaced again in the past week that Facebook is working on a phone. The latest news on the long-rumored project is that Facebook has abandoned its plan to work on both the hardware and software, as Apple does, and instead will partner with hardware manufacturer HTC. The Facebook phone's software, meanwhile, will be a modified version of Google's Android. The question is: Why? Why would a social network want to compete in the cell phone business? And how can it, given that Apple, Google and others already seem to have the market wrapped up? Does anyone want a Facebook phone? Perhaps Facebook users are clamoring for a new socially connected phone? Nope. Judging by the reaction to the news around the Web this past week, a good number of tech commentators and Facebook users aren't the slightest bit keen on the idea of Facebook releasing a cell phone. Privacy concerns are among the top objections. Facebook already has enough information about us, some people fear, and buying a Facebook phone would surely provide the social-networking giant with even more control over our personal data. In fact, an informal poll found that 80% of respondents did not want a Facebook phone. Only 7.8% said they'd consider it. If there's very little demand for a Facebook phone, then why pursue the idea? To find the answer, it helps to consider the biggest growth sectors in consumer technology. While social networking is a large-scale trend, the growth of mobile phones is perhaps a larger one. Other tech giants -- Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Google -- have all made their claims here. Facebook has not. In fact, Facebook is a laggard in mobile networking: Its iPad app launched a full 18 months after the groundbreaking tablet debuted. That's a lifetime in the fast-paced world of tech. App stores . This mobile megatrend breaks down into a series of smaller trends. Take app stores, for instance. The app store is now the dominant way to distribute software to devices: The companies that manage these stores control the future of computing. Facebook's Silicon Valley rivals, Apple and Google, own the largest app stores, while Amazon is likely to see success building its own app store on top of Google's Android. Facebook once looked to be the winner in app distribution -- the Facebook Platform showed huge promise -- but now it must go through its competitors to get its software on these devices. By building its own alternative to mobile app stores, either on top of Android or using HTML5 apps on the Web, Facebook might get back in the game. Mobile payments . What about mobile payments? It's often been said that if Facebook were a country, it would be one of the most populous in the world. Facebook would love for that ""country"" to have an economy to match, and that means having all its users embrace Facebook Credits. Meanwhile, using your phone instead of your credit card is set to be a huge trend in 2012 thanks to the addition of ""tap to pay"" technology in some handsets. It's the biggest change in payments technology since the credit card, and Facebook Credits doesn't stand a chance. Instead, rival Google is plowing ahead with Google Wallet, which when combined with Google's Android operating system could make Google a leader in this hot market. Social networking . What about social networking itself? Could the growth of mobile Web browsing undermine Facebook's leadership here? Facebook's closest competitors for the social crown are Twitter and Google+. So what would happen if Google were to put Google+ right into Android, the world's most popular mobile operating system? For Facebook, that could be disastrous. Google+ would come baked in to your phone, but getting Facebook would require an additional download. A win-win? So why is Facebook making a phone if nobody wants to buy one? Perhaps because it has to: If Facebook can't compete with Google and Apple in mobile technology, it may find itself on the losing side of some of consumer tech's greatest battles. I, for one, support the effort: If Facebook succeeds, we all benefit from more competition in the smartphone market. And if Facebook fails, we lose nothing. I'd even be willing to bet on the likely outcome. Facebook won't dominate the phone market, but it will figure out new ways to make our phones and our applications more social. That sounds like a positive outcome for all.","Informal poll: 80% of respondents don't want a Facebook phone .

"Pascagoula, Mississippi (CNN) -- A lack of screening of oil spill cleanup workers meant a sex offender got a job, and left him free to rape a colleague according to a Mississippi county sheriff. A CNN investigation into the incident reveals that basic background checks were not done on those hired to remove oil from the beaches in and around Pascagoula. Jackson County Sheriff Mike Byrd told CNN he was shocked when he met with the head of BP security for the area several weeks before the alleged rape took place. He said the BP representative told him that only drug screenings, not background checks, were being conducted on the cleanup workers. ""I said, 'You're kidding me.' He said, 'No.' He said, 'There's so many of them, we were told to do drug screens and that was it.' And I said, 'Well, that's not good at all.' "" Byrd said he told the BP official that ""you're going to have every type of person coming in here looking for a job, and you're going to have the criminal element in here, and we're not going to know who we're dealing with if we don't do background checks on these people."" ""It's sad because you got a victim now by a sex offender, and he's in our jail. Had we have known this, he would have been arrested before the crime could have been committed,"" said Byrd, who also said that if asked, his department would have done the background checks for free. Rundy Charles Robertson, 41, who faces charges of sexual battery and failure to register as a sex offender, is in the Jackson County, Mississippi, jail with bail set at $505,000. He told police that he had consensual sex with the woman. He has not yet entered a plea. Robertson has a criminal history dating back to 1991, according to police records. He was put on the national sex offender registry for a 1996 conviction for contributing to the delinquency of a minor in Louisiana. He is also on probation after being convicted in 2003 in Georgia for cruelty to children.  Read Boudreau's blog post on background checks for spill workers . Robertson had been supervising a crew of cleanup workers, including the alleged victim. She told CNN he offered to take her home one day in June because she was not feeling well. However, she said, when he dropped her off, he asked to use the bathroom in her motel room. When he came out, she said, he raped her. The woman told CNN she is scared and angry that this happened. ""If they would have ran the background checks, they wouldn't have a man like that working,"" she said. ""Emotionally, it's really, really messed me up. I get real upset at times, I go through anxiety. I feel angry, I feel dirty. I don't understand what gave him the right to take something -- or felt he could do what he wanted. ... I'm scared. I'm real scared."" She said she was laid off and is now unemployed. ""I find it unbelievable because BP and their subcontractors had relationships with all local law enforcement,"" said Adam Miller, the woman's attorney. ""They had the opportunity and the ability to clearly check all of these people that they were hiring and bringing in to ensure the safety of the public."" He said since the incident happened in June, it's been ""a living hell for her."" ""She gave up her housing where she was living to come here,"" Miller said. ""Now she's been raped, she doesn't have a job, and everybody walked away."" BP hired a company called Miller Environmental Group for the beach cleanup project. Miller hired Aerotek to find workers. In a statement to CNN, BP spokesman Robert Wine said, ""BP does conduct full checks on its employees, and under normal business conditions can make it a part of the contract for full backgrounds to be conducted by our long-term contractors. This was not done for all contractors in this response; the responsibility lies with the employing company for their own staff. The requirement on sub-contractors to BP's contractors is one further step beyond BP's scope of control."" Jeff Reichert, the general counsel for Aerotek, the company that hired Robertson, said his company was only following the contract it had with Miller Environmental Group, which did not require background checks. ""We are a staffing company. Our policy is at the client's request,"" Reichert said. He said only drug screenings and physicals were done. ""We are not liable for anything that happens,"" he said. ""Once we deliver the people to be supervised by our client, we don't have anything to do with them anymore."" He said, ""I don't know what Miller [Environmental Group's] obligation to BP is. It's BP's project. We are providing them the people they asked for per the contract."" In a statement sent to CNN on Thursday afternoon, Aerotek said that about 23 days after the incident, Miller ""informed Aerotek that it wanted criminal background checks conducted on current and future temporary employees assigned to the oil spill clean-up effort."" However, a tropical storm hit the area, and ""all Aerotek temporary workers assigned to the clean-up efforts at this site were terminated."" ""Aerotek's thoughts and support continue to go out to the alleged victim and her family,"" the statement said. CNN contacted Miller Environmental Group but did not get an immediate response. Leonard Nelson, who was Robertson's manager at Aerotek, said, ""There were quite a few, quite a few drug dealers from what I saw, people from all walks of life. There was no way that there was any kind of comprehensive background checks done. There's no way. You had guys walking in who actually had collars on, you know, the bands for house arrests. ... I don't know about you, but that strikes me as people you don't want working here."" Several other police departments on the Gulf Coast contacted by CNN said they conducted background checks. Euris Dubois, chief of police in Grand Isle, Louisiana, said he contacted BP and contractors about background checks. ""My residents in Grand Isle were concerned about these people,"" Dubois said. ""Everybody was kind of scared. So we started running background checks."" He said about one-fourth of the workers had a criminal history, but most of the crimes were misdemeanors. He said there were three registered sex offenders who were closely supervised by his officers. In LaFourche Parish, Louisiana, the sheriff's office screened about 1,500 workers and found 20 sex offenders and others with active arrest warrants, Sgt. Lesley Hill said. ""Many workers who heard of the screenings did not show up for work,"" she said. Watch Anderson Cooper 360° weeknights 10pm ET.

"Bangkok (CNN) -- More than two months of floods and 8 million people affected -- the disaster in Thailand is immense; the aid effort a challenge. Much of the effort appears to be internally driven. Thais across the country are donating food, water and clothing to help their countrymen in the worst-hit areas. Donations have far surpassed previous years. Floods happen every year here, but these are the worst in half a century and have left at least 283 dead. The Thai military and aid groups share the responsibility of distributing the life-saving supplies. In the ancient city of Ayutthara, one of the worst-hit regions, military trucks move slowly down the main street, cutting through a constant river of water, passing out aid to those who can get close. Anyone who has a boat is using it to transport aid or to help neighbors carrying their possessions as water levels rise and engulf homes. Those who don't have a boat are making do with rubber tires or even slabs of Styrofoam. There is a true sense of teamwork between the communities. The Bangkok suburb of Sam Kok is sandwiched between the overflowing Chao Phraya River and the 2.5-meter floodwalls that are so far successfully protecting the inner and commercial part of the capital. The water here has nowhere to go and levels are rising fast. La Sinsap, 60, has had to move into the local temple as his house is completely submerged. He says the situation is dire and help is not getting there fast enough to those who don't live on the main street. ""It's very bad around here,"" he told CNN. ""We don't have enough to eat."" Temples are playing a significant role in the disaster. Thailand is overwhelmingly Buddhist and many temples, although flooded themselves, have some dry floors on higher ground and have opened their doors to those in need. Monk Somkuan Thanajaro says it will take a long time to fix the waterlogged temple where Sinsap is staying. Huge Buddhas sit in stagnant water along what was once a river bank. The worry is if the water doesn't recede soon, the damage to these historic monuments could be permanent. But Thanajaro's first concern is helping his community, many of whom are now sleeping in the temple. ""Whenever we get donations, we share it all with the villagers,"" he says. The international community is responding to the disasters playing out across Thailand. China has donated $1.5 million and the United States $1 million. The U.S. is also sending 26 helicopters to help the relief effort, invaluable as more roads turn to rivers and become impassable. United Nations agencies also are on standby, activating their assessment teams and contingency planning in Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam, according to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The World Health Organization has offered emergency health kits.","8 million people are affected by the floods, which have killed 283 people .

"(CNN) -- The Professional Footballers' Association (PFA), a body which represents soccer players in England and Wales, has sent ex-professionals a guide on how to handle mental health issues following the death of Wales manager Gary Speed. Speed, who made over 500 appearances in the English Premier League during a 22-year playing career, was found dead at his home on Sunday, sending British football into mourning. Although it is not known whether Speed was struggling with depression or any mental health issues, the PFA, which is linked to a similar body in Scotland, has taken the step of making ""The Footballers' Guidebook"" available to 50,000 former players. The guide, which includes comic strip style drawings and case studies from former players, was sent to current players in July. ""Whether you're a king, a prince or a pauper, or a top sports star or the man in the street -- everybody is a human being and can have issues that they need help with,"" PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor told CNN. The issue of depression in football was highlighted by the death of German national team goalkeeper Robert Enke, who took his own life in 2009 after a long struggle with the illness. ""The PFA are going to do even more work to try and make sure that people know they can turn to somebody in such times,"" explained Taylor. ""We've got to do all we can."" ""The death of Gary is so devastating , we've got to do all we can to make sure it doesn't happen again."" Speed represented Leeds United, Everton, Newcastle United and Bolton Wanderers in England's top flight, before dropping into the second tier to play for, and later manage, Sheffield United. The former midfielder is the most-capped outfield player in Welsh history, having played for his country on 85 occasions. As a manager, Speed guided Wales to 45th in the world rankings, their highest position. A minutes applause will be held before all of this weekend's English Premier League matches in honor of Speed.","The PFA have sent 50,000 members advice on coping with mental illness .

"Niger (CNN) -- Dark shadows were lifting themselves off the sidewalk, slowly stretching, shaking the slumber from their limbs. It was 6:15 a.m. in Niger's capital, Niamey, and I was setting off on a 12-hour drive, leaving its lush boulevards for Agadez, the sands of the Sahara, the desert trails to Libya, and the chaos Moammar Gadhafi's war there is causing. The sun had yet to raise itself over the roofs but already the first hints of day were breaking the sleep of the destitute at the roadside. I have seen poverty before, but even shrouded in the predawn gray, there is no mistaking it: People with little of anything save a public place to lay their heads. Despite tough lives, the people here are warm, welcoming and hospitable. ""Bonjour,"" they say, hinting at their recent French colonial past. It seems to have overlaid, in part at least, their far earlier conversion to Islam. ""As-Salaamu Aleikum,"" the Arabic greeting, is rarely used. Long French loaves -- not Arabic flatbread -- are on sale at tiny stalls. We've already passed through the checkpoint on the outskirts of the capital before the countryside begins to take shape. Gendarmes in what look like fading French military fatigues checked the car's documents and a man in orange overalls took a few dollars' road toll for the 950 kilometers, or 600 miles, we will drive. The rope blocking our way across the road was dropped and we were released onto a strangely empty highway. Slowly the countryside began to show is colors. Gray shaded to blue, to a dark olive green. Then in an instant the sun smothers everything, washing away the stains of the night. Our journey lurches into gear, no longer feeling like we're sluggishly passing anonymous vegetation. Our momentum, at least in our minds, increases as we streak past the newly revealed rich green towering maize, the thickly leaved luxuriant trees. This land is green and fertile. Everything is vibrant in a way Timothy Leary could truly appreciate. In the villages, strange, bulging, round mud buildings - like an oversize, slightly squashed rugby ball - mingle with mud and straw shacks. They have no door, only a scant straw roof: grain stores hinting at the bounty of the land. Village after village, we pass them. The more there are, the bigger they are, the more grain is held and the more prosperous the people who own them. Lest this give an illusion of wealth, consider this: Most children we see are barefoot, and that's almost half Niger's people. Within a few hours of leaving the capital, none of the villages have electricity, running water, sanitation, a building that's not made out of mud and straw. The slightly larger towns have slightly more. But that's all. The farther we go, the villages become fewer and farther between. The muddy ponds, courtesy of the recent rains, shrink, and the striking longhorn cattle and goats jostle for a place to slake their thirst. The tarmac on the highway begins to break apart. We slam into potholes, lurching, juddering forward. The bright greens are gone, the vegetation paler and browner here. The great trees have shrunk to tiny shrubs. We are still 200 miles from Agadez. Grass covers some of the land, the grain huts are long gone, and quickly so is the road. We are no longer dodging potholes, we are driving in one big long one. The cell phone service that has surprisingly kept us company so much of the journey has also disappeared. In over a hundred miles, we pass but two tiny towns. This is what it means to be remote, where the land and sun are so unforgiving none can live, and this is where the bonds that tie a nation together begin to fray. The crowds that gathered about the car with rounded faces we saw in the morning have by afternoon given way to the thinner, lighter features of the Touareg. Those features are often hard to see, shrouded as they are by turbans that wrap around the face. By instinct, by life, by tradition, they are desert mountain people. Twice in the past two decades, they've risen up in armed rebellion against the government. Some joined Gadhafi's forces over the border in Libya. The government in Niamey worries Libya's war will create instability in Niger. Officials publicly say they fear Gadhafi's weapon stockpiles could be falling into al Qaeda's hands. Privately there's another fear, that the newly liberated guns could one day be turned on the government in another Touareg rebellion. But for now a Touareg rebellion seems the more distant possibility, because al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb is exploiting the Arab spring and every crumb of opportunity that might fall unnoticed from the battlefield. Their drug-, gun- and people-smuggling routes through the sparsely populated land we are crossing are hungry for the sustenance turmoil can bring. The more confusion and chaos there is, the easier it is to keep their networks hidden. It is these last few miles to Agadez that worry us the most. Al Qaeda has kidnapped several foreigners in this remote region in the past few years. We don't want to be unlucky names added to the list. While our driver is holding up well, almost 12 hours at the wheel, our fuel light has been on for a while. We've been running on reserve. He stops to top up the tank from a solitary liter bottle of fuel we purchased earlier in the day. There have been no milestones for a while and the sun is edging down to the dirt of the desert. We're hoping Agadez will soon come into view. How far can a four-wheel-drive off-road truck go on a liter of gas? Then we see a red-topped stone marker come into view. It reads 30 kilometers, 20 or so miles, to go. And not a soul around. We're racing the sun, our dwindling fuel and our fears. Each bend in the road I hope will be our last. Can the red light on the fuel gauge be any brighter? Probably not; it's a trick of the fading light easily worked on tense, tired eyes. Then, as if by clockwork, almost exactly 12 hours after we left Niamey, Agadez slips into view - low, dusty, dilapidated, but a delight to see. Uniformed gendarmes and a man in orange overalls greet us at the checkpoint, lower the rope and wave, their job for the day almost done; there can be few more drivers behind us. The litter-strewn streets are cluttered with vendors packing up their shabby wares. Dust and smoke cloud the air, making it hard to see much of this town. With better light tomorrow we'll get a good look at this place where Gadhafi is rumored to have spent millions paving roads, putting up lights, even building a hospital. A few hours later as I settle in to my bed, I can only wonder at the irony. Gadhafi is out there somewhere on the run, and I'll be getting a good night's sleep in the Agadez hotel he built.","Niger's goverment worries Libya's war will destabilize the country .

"(CNN)  -- Inter Milan's defense of their Serie A title may have taken a fatal blow with a 1-0 defeat at arch-rivals Juventus Sunday night. It left Leonardo's men eight points adrift of city rivals AC Milan, who romped to a 4-0 home win over Parma 24 hours earlier, but they still  have a game in hand. Alessandro Matri scored the winner for improving Juve in Turin after 30 minutes to improve their chances of claiming a Champions League spot. Frederik Sorensen's cross was missed by Ivan Cordoba and Matri headed home from close in. It was only the second defeat for Inter under their new Brazilian coach who replaced Rafael Benitez and they offered little as an attacking threat. The best chance came eight minutes from the end as Samuel Eto'o played a one-two with Wesley Sneijder but Gianluigi Buffon came out sharply to block the Cameroon star's effort. Earlier, Lazio maintained their title bid with a 2-0 win at Brescia to stay third, seven points adrift. Goals from Alvaro Gonzalez after 18 minutes and Libor Kozak just before the hour mark secured three vital points for the capital side. Coach Edy Reja asked the fans to be patient after his side have slipped in recent weeks. ""We were top and then second and then we lost a few places but there are times throughout a long season in which it's normal to have a bad spell,"" he told AFP. Udinese also kept up their pursuit of a European place with a 3-0 win at struggling Cesena. Antonio Di Natale scored a double allied to a strike by Gokhan Inler as they stay fifth. But Palermo saw their hopes nosedive with a shock 4-2 defeat at home to Fiorentina.","Juventus beat Italian champions Inter Milan 1-0 in Serie A clash .

"(CNN) -- German Bundesliga side Schalke have announced Huub Stevens as the replacement for recently-departed coach Ralf Rangnick, on the same day that former Danish international Michael Laudrup left his role as coach of Spanish club Real Mallorca. Rangnick, 53, guided Schalke to the semifinals of the European Champions League last season but left the Veltins Arena earlier this month, citing fatigue as his reason for leaving the club. Dutchman Stevens, 57, previously spent six years as Schalke coach between 1996 and 2002, guiding the Gelsenkirchen outfit to a UEFA Cup triumph against Italian giants Inter Milan in 1997. Stevens, who has also had spells in charge of Hertha Berlin, Hamburg and PSV Eindhoven, has signed a two-year deal. ""Huub Stevens, who coached the Royal Blues from 1996 to 2002, has returned to his former stomping ground with immediate effect,"" read a statement on the club's official website. ""Stevens has put pen to paper on a contract to 30 June 2013."" Schalke currently sit fifth in Germany's top division, having won four and lost three of their opening seven matches. As Schalke appointed a new coach, Laudrup ended his one-year tenure in charge of Mallorca. Laudrup, who represented Denmark on 104 occasions, announced his decision to leave the club at a press conference on Tuesday. The former Spartak Moscow coach made the decision due to his relationship with club owner Lorenzo Serra Ferrer becoming damaged beyond repair. ""This situation cannot continue like this,"" Laudrup, 47, said. ""From now on, Mallorca will be whatever it is Serra Ferrer wants."" Laudrup guided Mallorca to a 17th-place finish last season as the one-time Copa del Rey winners avoided relegation by just one point. The club sold star midfielder Jonathan de Guzman to Spanish rivals Villarreal in August and Laudrup saw his assistant Erik Larsen sacked on Monday. ""Yesterday one of my assistants was fired,"" he said. ""Once again, it is very difficult -- if not impossible -- to find the peace required to work here. ""The team is hurt by this situation. What we need is calm and I cannot go home every night, angry, disappointed. I have a family."" Laudrup's final game in charge was a 2-1 win over Real Sociedad on Sunday, and his former charges travel to Osasuna on Saturday.","Huub Stevens hass returned to Schalke after departure of Ralf Rangnick .

"Cairo (CNN) -- The much anticipated trial of former Egyptian Interior Minister Habib El Adly has been postponed until August 3 -- the same day Egypt's ousted president is scheduled to stand trial. El Adly and former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak face charges of killing pro-democracy protesters during the revolution that started six months ago. El Adly's trial at a Cairo court was expected to be carried live on state television Monday. This is second time the trial was postponed amid frustrations among protesters in Tahrir Square who demand speedy trials and swift judgments for detained officials from Mubarak's regime. Judge Adel Abdel Salam Gomaa announced the postponement to a court room packed with people -- many of whom had already learned about the decision on Egyptian State TV. ""The decision was leaked by the lawyers before the hearing and broadcast before the defendants and judge even entered the court -- which was a big mistake, "" said Aly Hassan, a judicial consultant with the Ministry of Justice. El Adly appeared with a blue uniform because he had been sentenced to 12 years for corruption charges. Six of his former assistants, who were also set to stand trial for allegedly killing protesters, appeared in white suits. The authorities asked all journalists to leave the court except for Egyptian TV staff in charge of broadcasting the trial. ""Do they expect us to believe that Mubarak will appear with Adly in two weeks at a court when he has been in Sharm el-Sheikh for six months?"" said Noor Noor, an activist and son of presidential candidate Ayman Noor. The 83-year-old ex-ruler fell into a coma earlier this month, Mubarak lawyer Farid El Deeb told CNN. He later regained consciousness, said Mohamed Fathalla, the head of the Sharm el-Sheikh facility where Mubarak was recuperating. Hassan said Mubarak and El Adly are expected to be tried in the coastal city due to security issues. More than 800 protesters were killed during the Egyptian revolution when pro-democracy protests forced Mubarak to step down on February 11. CNN's Amir Ahmed contributed to this report.","Former Egyptian Interior Minister Habib El Adly faces charges of killing protesters .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- As some opposition groups met with the Egyptian government in an effort to find a diplomatic solution to its political crisis, reports continued to surface of security forces detaining journalists and human rights activists. On Sunday, an Al-Jazeera English correspondent was detained by the military on Sunday, though Egyptian leaders insisted that journalists and others were free to carry out their work in Egypt. He was released later that night, Al-Jazeera said. Al-Jazeera English's Cairo-based correspondent, Ayman Mohyeldin, was detained from early Sunday afternoon until night, network producer Tristan Redman told CNN. Another correspondent, Sherine Tadros, was held at a military checkpoint near the television station, but released within the hour, he said. Mohyeldin was near Tahrir Square, the focal point of protests against the Egyptian government, when he was detained. Egyptian Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq told CNN that authorities have been told ""not to bother"" human rights activists and journalists working at anti-government protests. If there have been such problems, they are ""not intended,"" Shafiq told CNN's Candy Crowley. Arrests of journalists and human rights activists ""are not allowed at all."" A U.S. embassy spokesperson in Cairo told CNN that the American government has raised the issue of the treatment of journalists with the Egyptian government ""consistently, and will continue to do so."" Sameh Shoukry, Egypt's ambassador to the United States, also said the Egyptian government is opposed to violence against journalists of human rights workers. ""The government has denied its involvement in acts of violence and has promised a full and wide investigation that will be transparent and that will find those responsible,"" he said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" Sunday. All forms of violence have been condemned, he said. Asked whether the government had ordered a crackdown on journalists, Shoukry said, ""I think that whatever the case, we must resort to a full investigative process."" He said that such accusations were based on ""assumptions"" and not proof. A leading international human rights group says military police raided the offices of Hisham Mubarak Law Center late last week and arrested some 35 journalists and human rights activists documenting the crisis in Egypt. They were freed Friday after nearly two days in military custody, Amnesty International said. ""We welcome the news that these activists have been freed, but we are outraged that they were detained in the first place and by the manner in which they have been treated,"" said Malcolm Smart, Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa director. He said the whereabouts of several other activists detained in separate incidents are unknown. ""The Egyptian authorities must now carry out an urgent independent investigation into why human rights activists monitoring protests in Cairo were targeted in this way, and who gave the orders for it,"" Smart said. In recent days, some have accused President Hosni Mubarak of orchestrating the assaults to suppress international coverage of bloodshed by pro-government operatives against peaceful protesters in Cairo's Tahrir Square. Journalists attempting to cover unrest in Egypt also reported being beaten, arrested and harassed by security forces and police on Thursday, leading to sharply limited television coverage of the protests. Along with Al-Jazeera, other news outlets -- including the BBC, Al-Arabiya, ABC News, the Washington Post, Fox News and CNN -- said members of their staffs had been attacked or otherwise targeted. Besides Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch also reported that staffers were detained. U.S. State Department officials told CNN earlier that they had information that Egypt's Interior Ministry was behind the journalist detentions, citing reports from the U.S. Embassy in Egypt.

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Wednesday challenged Republicans to ""fight as hard for middle-class families as you do for those who are more fortunate,"" telling a Pennsylvania crowd to push Congress to extend the payroll tax cut enacted a year ago. Obama met with a family in Scranton, the birthplace of Vice President Joe Biden, then spoke at a nearby high school in what will be a battleground state in next year's presidential election. Sounding the populist themes of his re-election bid so far, Obama complained that congressional Republicans were out of touch with mainstream American support for his jobs bill that included an extension of the payroll tax cut. He noted Senate Republicans previously blocked debate on the plan, saying that ""their actions lately don't reflect who we are as a people."" A loud cheer erupted when Obama described the Democratic proposal to extend and expand the reduced payroll tax rate by saying: ""It is paid for by asking our wealthiest citizens to pay their fair share."" Noting the hard-line Republican opposition in deficit reduction negotiations to any tax increases for the wealthy, Obama urged the audience to ask its elected representatives ""are you willing to fight as hard for middle-class families as you do for those who are more fortunate?"" ""Send your senators a message,"" Obama said to cheers. ""Tell them don't be a grinch. Don't be a grinch. Don't vote to raise taxes on working American during the holidays."" Economists say the payroll tax cut -- part of a congressional spending deal negotiated last December -- has contributed to the nation's economic recovery. Congressional Republicans have indicated support for extending the lower payroll tax rate for another year, but differ with Obama and Democrats on covering the more than $200 billion price tag. A Democratic bill under consideration by the Senate would assess a 3.25% tax on income above $1 million a year to cover the cost. Republicans reject any tax increases and offered their alternative later Wednesday, calling for a freeze of federal salaries, reducing the federal workforce and preventing millionaires from getting food stamps and unemployment benefits. ""Republicans will put aside their misgivings and support this extension, not because we believe as the President does that another short-term stimulus will turn this economy around ... but because we know it will give some relief to struggling workers out there who continue to need it nearly three years into this presidency,"" Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said Wednesday on the Senate floor. The Democratic surtax would hit wealthy Americans who create jobs, McConnell added, arguing such a strategy made no sense. The debate, he said, is about ""whether we should help those who are struggling in a bad economy by punishing the private sector businesses that the American people are counting on to help turn this economy around."" The White House pushed back against the Republican argument. Spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters traveling with Obama to Pennsylvania that the White House was open to Republican ideas on the legislation. At the same time, Earnest noted that Republicans have defended Bush-era tax cuts for millionaires but now raised questions about helping ease the tax burden of working-class Americans. On Tuesday, the new chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, Alan Krueger, told reporters that the proposed surtax on incomes above $1 million ""would hit very few small businesses."" ""The vast majority -- one figure I saw was 99% of individuals with small business income -- would not be affected by this,"" Krueger said. According to the non-partisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 121 million families have benefited from the payroll tax break, with an increase in take-home pay of $934 for the average worker. Moody's Analytics estimated in August that letting the tax cut expire would reduce growth by as much as 0.5%. It called extending the cut one of the ""most straightforward"" ways to ""reduce some of the coming fiscal restraint."" The Democrats' bill would extend and expand last year's tax break. Payroll taxes, cut to 4.2% from 6.2% last year, would be lowered to 3.1% to provide middle class families with up to $1,500 more in their paychecks next year, Democrats said. Their measure also would partially extend the break to employers, hoping that might spur hiring. The price tag of the bill is about $265 billion, paid for by the 3.25% surtax on annual income above $1 million, according to Democratic aides. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada noted Tuesday that polls show a majority of Republican voters think wealthy Americans should pay more in taxes. ""The only place in America that people don't want a fair system is Republicans here in the Senate,"" Reid said. By contrast, the Republican plan would continue the 4.2% payroll tax rate for a year and pay for it by imposing a three-year freeze on federal salaries and reducing the federal workforce by 10% through replacing workers when they quit or retire. In addition, the plan would require Americans earning $750,000 a year or more to pay higher premiums for Medicare, and also prevent millionaires from getting food stamps or unemployment compensation. According to a Republican aide, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office found that the Medicare, food stamp and unemployment provisions would save $9 billion over 10 years, mostly from the Medicare part. A statement by Reid spokesman Adam Jentleson said the Republican plan would never pass i the Democrat-controlled Senate, ""but now that Republicans have reversed their position on the middle-class tax cut, we look forward to working with them to negotiate a consensus solution."" Obama's trip Wednesday was his 17th to Pennsylvania since taking office. Obama won the state by a 10-point margin in 2008, but Pennsylvania is seen as largely in play in the 2012 contest. A Franklin and Marshall College poll taken in early November indicated Obama ahead of potential Republican rivals in Pennsylvania in hypothetical 2012 general election showdowns. However, many voters surveyed said they hadn't yet made up their mind about whom to support in the presidential election.

'I make my own baby food' My mom bought me this amazing baby-food maker, the Beaba. (Says mom Kris Jenner: ""Who knew she would be that excited about a baby-food maker? I bought her a million handbags, and I never got that reaction."") I steam and puree fruits and vegetables, and they last for like four days. Mason pretty much loves everything. I gave him red beets, and it got all over his face, which made the funniest picture. He also loves sweet potatoes, carrots, and yams. Sometimes I mix pureed peaches, pears, bananas, or apples with plain yogurt or an all-natural organic jelly. I have this great book called ""Super Baby Food"" that's full of ideas. I should be on this Mason diet! Parenting.com: Adorable outtakes from Kourtney and Mason's New York photo shoot . 'I have no desire to go out' Unless I'm working, I can't be away from him without feeling guilty. It doesn't feel good or natural to be, so it's a struggle. My friends keep saying, ""You and [boyfriend Scott Disick] should go out and eat or do something."" Recently my sister Kim watched Mason so we could go to dinner. It took so long -- actually, it probably didn't take so long, but to us it felt like it took long -- we were like, should we just get pizza and go home? Scott says he doesn't need to wine and dine me anymore. We would be just as happy having a slice of pizza sitting in bed with our son. 'Mason sleeps in bed with me' If I've had a long day, then I have that time at night, which is really important to me. Mason did fall on the floor once by mistake. It was the worst moment. I freaked out and looked online [to research the dangers associated with a baby falling off the bed]. He was fine but crying, so I e-mailed the doctor at four in the morning. He wrote me right back, yet I stayed up all night to watch him sleep to make sure he was okay. I've since lowered our mattress to the floor. I put pillows all around the floor, too. I am doing the best that I can, and I feel really confident in that. Unless someone has walked in your shoes, you really can't judge. Everyone needs to make the best choice for their life.

I need to have energy for my son, and I haven't worked out since. I take Mason on a lot of walks. Carrying him around is like carrying 20 pounds all day.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Jonathan Hanson and Katina Wright are determined to give their infant daughter a bright and stable future despite the cloud of uncertainty they face after years without steady work. Once successful real estate agents making six figures, Hanson and Wright are now living on the poverty line. ""We made some good money,"" Hanson said. ""But with new regulations in real estate and different laws and just the amount of foreclosures on the market, it literally took our business away."" The last few years have been a downward spiral, says the Atlanta couple, who have been living off their savings. They've sold jewelry and cars, and now they're trying to sell their home to survive. Every day, they are faced with a tough decision. ""You have to pick and choose what you want to do,"" Hanson said. ""It's either eat that day or pay a bill."" They're not alone. Millions of American families have slipped into what the U.S. Census Bureau defines as poor. About 46.2 million people are considered to be living in poverty, 2.6 million more than last year. ""Those that are in dire need, they'll sell all their personal belongings to survive,"" said Sal Dimiceli, one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2011. Through his weekly newspaper column, Dimiceli hears from dozens of people each week who are facing hard times. And for decades, he has made every effort to help them get back on their feet. Through his nonprofit, The Time Is Now To Help, Dimiceli has provided about 500 people a year with food, rent, utilities and other necessities. ""We get them back on a track (so) that ... their pride is given back to them,"" Dimiceli said this year. ""They can catch up."" There haven't been this many Americans living in poverty since 1993, according to the Census Bureau. More than 15% of the population is now considered poor. The rate is 22% for children, meaning at least one of every five U.S. kids is living in poverty. ""If you qualify as being in poverty today, then you're really in deep poverty,"" said Mark Bergel, founder and executive director of A Wider Circle, a Maryland-based charity that provides furniture and other basic necessities to needy families. Bergel told CNN's Lisa Sylvester that the numbers used to define poverty today are extremely low and ""based on an outdated formula from the '60s."" The Census Bureau defines an individual as poor if they make less than $11,139 a year. The dollar amount rises for every member added to the household. For example, the average family of four is considered poor if they make less than $22,314. For a family of three like Hanson, Wright and their daughter, the threshold is just a little more than $17,000. ""There's a lot of people suffering,"" said Karen Lee, a financial planner and author of several books, including ""Simple Steps to Help People Get Unstuck Financially."" Lee said it's important for people who've never faced poverty to keep a positive outlook and believe that things can get better. ""I have seen people go from riches to rags to riches to rags,"" she said. ""You can rebuild, and you can completely change careers and rebuild."" That's what Hanson and Wright are doing. Hanson is betting on a new business he started: building security cages for air conditioners to prevent copper theft. Wright is teaching herself Web development. ""I literally threw my Rolodex away, because it was all real-estate-related,"" she said. ""It's no longer of any use to me. So being able to let go is going to be a person's biggest advantage.""","Poverty levels are the highest since 1993, according to the U.S. Census Bureau .

"(CNN) -- A first-half hat-trick by Lionel Messi helped Barcelona to a 5-0 win over Mallorca at the Nou Camp on Saturday. The Argentina international opened the scoring after 13 minutes with a spot kick after Emilio Nsue had handled the ball in the penalty area. Eight minutes later he tapped in after a miscue from Adriano before completing his hat-trick on the half-hour mark, expertly guiding home a cross from Dani Alves. Twenty-year-old Issac Cuenca scored his first senior goal for the club five minutes into the second half, while Alves rounded things off with a superbly taken goal in injury time. A ninth-minute goal from Argentina striker Higuain earned Real Madrid a 1-0 win at Real Sociedad on Saturday night. The win puts them one point ahead of Barcelona at the top of La Liga with 25 points, although Levante will depose them if they win at Osasuna on Sunday. Two goals from Frenchman Sofiane Feghouli and one for Aritz Aduriz earned fourth-placed Valencia a 3-1 win over Getafe, while Villareal were comfortable 2-0 winners over Rayo Vallecano -- Bruno Soriano and Borja Valero scoring goals in either half. Meanwhile in Italy, Juventus remain top of Serie A after a 2-1 win at Inter Milan on Saturday. All the goals came in an action-packed first half with Juve taking an early lead thanks to a 12th minute strike from Mirko Vucinic. Maicon equalized for the hosts in the 28th minute, but it wasn't long before the visitors were back in front -- Claudio Marchisio scoring in the 33rd minute. The win gives Juve a two-point lead at the top of Serie A, but that will be reduced to one point if Udinese beat Palermo on Sunday. Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored twice as AC Milan beat Roma 3-2 at the Stadio Olimpico to send the reigning league champions up to second in the table. The Swedish striker opened the scoring in the 17th minute before Nicolas Burdisso equalized for the home side in the 28th minute. Alessandro Nesta restored Milan's lead two minutes later before Ibrahimovic made it 3-1 in the 78th minute to all but clinch three points. Bojan Krkic pulled one back for Roma three minutes before the end but it wasn't enough to deny the Rossoneri vital away points. Napoli lost ground with the league leaders as they went down to a 2-1 defeat at Catania. Edinson Cavani had given Napoli the lead after just 27 seconds, but goals from Giovanni Marchese in the 25th minute and Gonzalo Bergessio three minutes after the break were enough to earn the home side all three points. Napoli played half the match with 10 men after Mario Santana was sent off shortly before half time.","Messi scores hat-trick inside 30 minutes in 5-0 mauling of Mallorca .

"(CNN) -- Clashes were reported Friday in Bahrain's capital on the eve of parliamentary elections in the country. Security forces were sent to rallies to deal with what the Interior Ministry called ""illegal acts which resulted from demonstrations,"" the state news agency reported. The ministry said that saboteurs and outlaws stormed the City Center mall in Manama Friday afternoon, ""intent on sowing chaos and terrorizing shoppers,"" according to the Bahrain News Agency. Those arrested will face legal action, officials said. The ministry blamed the rallies on ""instigative calls posted on social networking sites."" Unspecified arrests and injuries were reported in the clashes. It was not clear late Friday how many involved pro- or anti-government protesters. There also were unconfirmed reports of tear gas used by security forces on demonstrators. City Center was back to normal late Friday, according to the Interior Ministry. A march on the Lulu Square area of Manama brought a halt to traffic in much of the capital. A heavy police presence was evident as people prepared to vote Saturday. Residents of some villages have vowed to boycott. The elections are being held to replace 18 seats that were vacated by Al-Wefaq, the country's largest opposition party. The party vacated the seats to protest the treatment of demonstrators during February's unrest in Bahrain. An opposition group called The February 14 Coalition said it planned to launch protests on Friday and Saturday in the newly named Martyr's Square, the site formerly known as Pearl Roundabout. ""Just like all other freedom-loving people living in real democracies across the globe, we, the people of Bahrain have the right to choose the way in which we are governed,"" the group said. The Youth Coalition of February 14 announced it would be holding a sit-in demonstration at the same location. Addressing an opposition rally in Tubli, a village south of Manama, Thursday, Sheikh Ali Salman, head of the Al-Wefaq party said, ""when we talk about democracy we want democracy like that of Westminster, France, and America, not the democracy of Saddam Hussein, nor the democracy of Zine El Abidine, nor the democracy of Gadhafi."" Shaikh Fawaz bin Mohammed Al Khalifa, president of Bahrain's Information Affairs Authority, said he expected voter turnout to be encouraging Saturday, according to the state-run Bahrain News Agency. Bahrain's King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa was attending the U.N. General Assembly in New York. On Thursday he spoke about the need for reforms ""aimed to provide decent living conditions, security and tranquility in a society of peaceful coexistence.""","NEW: Clashes reported in capital of Manama .

"(CNN) -- Iranian media outlets have ""systematically stirred up"" widespread contempt toward the country's 300,000-strong Baha'i religious minority, the group says. The Baha'i International Community issued a report Friday entitled ""Inciting Hatred: Iran's media campaign to demonize Baha'is."" The report ""documents and analyzes more than 400 media items over a 16-month period."" The result, the Baha'is say, is an ""insidious state-sponsored effort"" to discredit the Baha'is with ""false accusations, inflammatory terminology, and repugnant imagery."" Iranians officials at the United Nations and in Tehran could not be reached for comment. Among ""recurring themes"" in media coverage about Baha'is, the report said, is that they are ""anti-Islamic,"" a ""deviant"" and ""cult-like"" sect, agents of Zionism, spies for Israel and the West, morally corrupt and an influence in the shah's government, toppled in 1979. New themes have emerged in recent months, the report says. The report says the Baha'is have instigated opposition to the regime, influenced ""anti-regime"" Iranian human rights activists, including Nobel Peace Prize winner Shirin Ebadi, controls or influences foreign broadcasters, such as the BBC and Voice of America, and helped plan and participated in the 2009 Ashura protests against the presidential elections earlier that year. The group also said the media ""uses brainwashing to entice Muslims away from their faith,"" and ""security attractive young women to lure converts."" ""This anti-Baha'i propaganda is shocking in its volume and vehemence, its scope and sophistication,"" said Bani Dugal, Principal Representative of the Baha'i International Community to the United Nations. ""It's all cynically calculated to stir up antagonism against a peaceful religious community whose members are striving to contribute to the well-being of their society,"" she said. ""The parallels between the campaign of anti-Baha'i propaganda in Iran today and other state-sponsored, anti-religious campaigns of the past are undeniable. History shows us that such campaigns are among the foremost predictors of actual violence against religious minorities -or, in the worst case, precursors of genocide."" The Baha'i faith, founded during the 19th century in Iran and now with 5 million to 6 million adherents worldwide, is a monotheistic religion that focuses on the spiritual unity of humanity. But Iran's Shiite Muslim ruling ayatollahs regard the faith as blasphemous because its founder, Bahaullah, declared himself to be a prophet of God. Muslims believe the Prophet Mohammed was the last prophet of God. The group said the anti-Baha'i messages are ""originates with and are sanctioned by the country's highest levels of leadership, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei."" Iran, however, claims that international media are an arm of a Baha'i conspiracy. Those claims are ""both ludicrous and funny, if it wasn't so sad,"" said Mohamed Abdel Dayem, the program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists' Middle East and North Africa program. ""Any international media outlet that carries news that is not identical to the Iranian government's line is accused of being an agent of fill in the blank: The Baha'is, the Americans, the Mossad."" The U.S. Commission for International Religious Freedom -- an independent, bipartisan federal agency -- regularly documents the Iranian regime's actions toward the Baha'is. A USCIRF official said the Iranian government's media campaign to denigrate and vilify the Baha'i community is part of its long-standing policy to not only incite violence against Baha'is but also to seek a slow death of the community's very existence in the country. ""The longer you wear down a community by demonizing them, intimidating them, depriving them, and arresting and imprisoning them - the hope is that you achieve your goal of total eradication,"" said Dwight Bashir, deputy director for policy and research at USCIRF. The Baha'i report cities more than 200 ""specious and misleading articles"" by the semi-official Kayhan newspaper. USCIRF also singles out Kayhan. ""Among those responsible for this media initiative has been Hossein Shariatmadari, managing editor of the government-controlled Kayhan newspaper, who was appointed by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei himself,"" Bashir said. ""Kayhan's articles about the Baha'i community have been a combination of vitriol and falsified information that has served to justify many of the egregious actions taken by the government against members of the community. As a consequence, USCIRF has urged the U.S. government to add Shariatmadari to its sanctions list of Iranian officials responsible for severe violations of human rights, including religious freedom,"" said Bashir. Faraz Sanei, Iran researcher with the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch, said rights groups have long documented the government's ""systematic campaign, both in law and practice, to target Baha'is and ""deprive them of of their ability to freely manifest the beliefs and teachings of their faith."" Sanei said the ""report provides valuable insight into the mechanics of a less documented and more insidious element of this campaign - anti-Baha'i propaganda propagated by official and semi-official media outlets, and the degree to which hate speech further exposes an already vulnerable minority group to discrimination and attacks by private actors.""","The Baha'is say Iranian media are demonizing them .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Six months after the improbable revolt that toppled one of the world's longest-serving rulers, protesters are once again camping in Cairo's Tahrir Square to demand speedy change. The president they ousted, Hosni Mubarak, faces a possible death sentence if he survives a variety of ailments that have left him hospital-bound since April. The tourists who once flocked to the pyramids of Giza and the beaches of the Red Sea have yet to return, and the joblessness and poverty that fueled the protests is deeper than before. The result is a revolution that remains incomplete, with the coalition that formed in Tahrir Square splintering over different visions of a post-Mubarak future. But few dispute that the uprising launched on January 25 has changed an ancient nation in a fundamental way. ""I am optimistic about the future. We can't go back,"" said Lillian Wagdy, a photographer who was taking part in the protests. ""The wall of fear has fallen, and the people will now demand their rights and stay on the streets."" And Fawaz Gerges, director of the Middle East Center at the London School of Economics, said Egyptians have undergone a ""psychological rapture"" since the revolution. ""The psychology of the citizen has changed,"" he said. ""Millions of voiceless people have regained their voices ... It's changed the relationship between sons and fathers and fathers and daughters."" The protests lasted 18 days, growing despite clashes with police and pro-Mubarak gangs. The armed forces refused to intercede on Mubarak's behalf, and he handed over power to a council of generals on February 11. The generals suspended Egypt's constitution and named a civilian caretaker government, but remain the final authority in Cairo. That's one of the things that rankles the protesters who have made camp in Tahrir Square since a fresh round of protests in June. ""For me to leave Tahrir, the ruling generals need to listen to our demands and take action to ensure them,"" said Mustafa Sadek, a 16-year-old high-school student taking part in the protests last week. ""We also want a clear schedule, a path to elections and reform. We want a plan that lays out the future."" Rajia Omran, a lawyer and human rights activist, said the revolution ""isn't going too bad."" But she said patience will be needed for months or even years to come. ""It will take 5 to 10 years to evaluate the revolution,"" said Omran, whose group helped organize the first protests. ""Nobody can evaluate it now. Any evaluation now is premature."" With liberals, nationalists, leftists and Islamists now split over whether elections or constitutional reforms should come first, Gerges said the protesters are realizing an old lesson: ""Revolutions are messy."" But those debates are ""a healthy sign that civil society is still alive."" ""My worry is the cleavages are much deeper than we think, and the question is, will there be a government that will be able to govern in the next two or three years?"" Gerges said. ""If you don't have a consensus on what the future is, you won't be able to govern."" Jumana Shehata, a former media consultant at the National Council for Human Rights, has been critical of the path the revolution has taken. She said secular political parties need more time to organize as a counterweight to the long-suppressed Muslim Brotherhood. ""Right now, the Muslim Brotherhood is the only strong party, and we need more diversity,"" she said. But Gerges said the Brotherhood has its own divisions, with younger members ""closer to the nationalists and the liberals and the leftists than the old guard."" The military's decision recent decision to delay parliamentary elections until November is a concession to the secular groups, said Shadi Hamid, an analyst at the Qatar-based branch of the Brookings Institution. Hamid said that vote ""will clarify matters,"" demonstrating which of the competing factions ""have the support and capability to push things forward and challenge the military's hold on power."" Shehata took part in the January protests at Tahrir Square and said most Egyptians still support the revolution, but are ""fed up"" with the new demonstrations. ""I understand the chaos after a revolution, but I don't see the people in Tahrir now as revolutionaries,"" she said. And Hamid called the renewed protests a ""frightening turn"" in post-revolutionary Egypt. ""More and more, the military staff is being portrayed as an enemy of democracy and an enemy of the transition, at least among the people in Tahrir Square,"" Hamid said. Neither side appears willing to back down, ""and it increasingly looks like the interests of both sides are in some ways impossible to reconcile."" Egypt's military has been the backbone of the state since 1952, when Col. Gamal Abdel Nasser led a coup that toppled the country's monarchy -- and the generals will likely try to keep much of that influence in any new government, said Nathan Brown, a Middle East analyst at George Washington University. ""There's no question the military does not want to be responsible for collecting the trash and running the schools and the health-care system and the economy, which is a mess,"" Brown told CNN. ""They don't want civilian oversight when they do go back to the barracks, and they don't want to lose a privileged position in Egyptian political and social life."" But that sort of privilege may be harder to come by in the new Egypt. During the March referendum on changes to the country's constitution, Brown said, newspapers carried stories about VIPs who showed up at polling places where long lines had formed, expecting to be allowed to vote ahead of the hoi polloi. ""Every time this happened, they were told, 'Wait a minute, this is a different country now. You've got to wait in line,'"" he said. ""It's a less deferential, less hierarchical place than it used to be."" Hamid said the most realistic outcome is that the military will keep ""some control"" over international affairs and defense policy in a new government, as well as its extensive economic interests. But he said the generals appear to be boxing in the debate over their own authority in advance. At the same time, Egyptians are awaiting a reckoning with Mubarak and some of the leading figures in his former regime. Mubarak and his ex-interior minster, Habib al-Adly, are accused of ordering police to use live ammunition on protesters -- a charge that could carry a death sentence upon conviction. Several other figures, including Mubarak's two sons, face public corruption charges. And Wagdy said some of the generals need to be in the dock as well. ""The main generals were part of the Mubarak regime and part of the corruption,"" she said. ""We need to dig into their files and prosecute them."" Gerges said the show trials that followed the 1952 coup ""did a great deal of damage to the whole question of justice,"" and warned that similar treatment of Mubarak would be ""horrible for Egypt."" ""I do hope that the Egyptian judicial system and Egyptians resist the temptation for vengeance and give Mubarak and his cronies a day in court and due process,"" he said. And Shehata said what Egypt needs is a process like South Africa's post-apartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission, in which those responsible for human rights abuses became eligible for amnesty if they came forward and testified truthfully about their actions. ""I don't believe it is right to call everyone who worked in the old regime as corrupt,"" she said. ""You either agree in the system and let the law decide about the people, or you take matters into your own hands and act like they are acting.""

"Rome (CNN) -- Seven people have died and seven others are missing after rains triggered severe flooding in northern Italy, civil protection officials said Friday. Especially hard hit was the tourist-popular Cinque Terre region on Italy's northwest coast. The Italian Council of Ministers declared a state of emergency in the flood region, which means 65 million euros ($91 million) will be put aside to deal with the disaster, the Corriere della Sera newspaper reported. A special cabinet meeting was called Friday to discuss the situation, the Italian government said. Heavy rains continued to fall Thursday night in Milan and other spots across the southern European nation, according to the Servizio Meteorologico, Italy's official weather agency. The agency gave an alert about intense, widespread rainfall -- potentially with strong wind gusts and hail -- in the regions of Calabria and Basilicata in southern Italy, as well as the eastern part of Sicily. Meanwhile, Monterosso al Mare -- between Genoa and Pisa in the Cinque Terre region of Liguria -- has been ""isolated, accessible only by sea"" because of earlier rains and floods, Mayor Angelo Betta told the news agency ANSA. So, too, is the nearby town of Vernazza, with even bulldozers and cranes still not able to reach it. That said, Betta reported some progress Thursday thanks to round-the-clock efforts by emergency workers and volunteers to clean up the town. One volunteer in that community died in the flood Wednesday. ""The situation is much better compared to yesterday,"" Betta said. Italy's Defense Ministry noted Thursday on its website that 348 military personnel have deployed to the provinces of Massa Carrara and La Spezia to assist in the wake of flooding here. Three people were killed after a house collapsed in La Spezia, an ANSA report said. ANSA also reported that prosecutors have opened a manslaughter investigation related to the deaths of two people from flood-related injuries in Aulla. Authorities are assessing whether their deaths had anything to do with faulty work that may have caused the Magra River to overflow. The weather has also caused major travel headaches throughout the region. A mudslide that trapped a truck driver, who was eventually freed, has caused the A12 highway in Liguria to be blocked since Tuesday. Train services in Liguria have been halted, too, due to mud and debris on the tracks. CNN's Hada Messia and Marilia Brochetto contributed to this report.","NEW: The death toll rises to seven and a state of emergency is declared .

"Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt (CNN) -- The arduous Middle East peace talks continued on Tuesday in Egypt, where officials from Israel and the Palestinian Authority ""have begun a serious discussion on core issues,"" a top U.S. diplomat said. ""They have agreed to begin first on working to achieve a framework agreement for permanent status. That work is now well under way,"" said U.S. special envoy George Mitchell. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas attended the sessions, along with Mitchell and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Officials met for an hour and 40 minutes in bilateral and multilateral meetings. Mitchell briefed the media after the session and said the goals remain a two-state solution, condemnation of violence and working toward security, and a resolution of all issues. He reiterated the Obama administration's position that Israel should extend the moratorium on settlement construction in the West Bank, a hiatus scheduled to end later this month. ""We believe we are moving in the right direction overall,"" he said. The parties are aiming toward resolving all core issues within the next 12 months in a process that kicked off recently during a meeting between Netanyahu, Abbas and Clinton in Washington. Issues separating both sides include Jewish settlements in the West Bank, the future of Palestinian refugees, Israeli security, and the status of Jerusalem. Clinton and Mitchell are expected to continue talks with the leaders in Jerusalem on Wednesday. Tensions are growing over the issue of possible new Israeli settlements in the West Bank. Netanyahu is under pressure from the Palestinians and the Obama administration to extend a 10-month moratorium on building Israeli settlements in the disputed West Bank territory. That moratorium is set to expire September 26. Palestinians have said the construction would torpedo the talks, but Israel says some construction is likely. Acknowledging that the settlement issue is sensitive in Israel, Mitchell said both sides have a responsibility to continue the meetings and he called on Abbas to take steps to advance the talks. ""All issues ultimately must be resolved by the parties themselves,"" Mitchell told reporters. ""The United States will, as we've said on many occasions, be an active and sustained partner throughout the talks and will, when necessary and appropriate, make proposals and provide encouragement to the parties. In the end, matters must be resolved by parties themselves and we hope and expect that they will do so."" Mitchell said he wouldn't divulge many details about the talks, noting the importance of confidentiality and sensitivity. But he did say ""our vision is for a two-state solution."" ""That includes a Jewish, democratic state of Israel living side by side in peace and security with a viable, independent, sovereign and contiguous state of Palestine. But of course, this is one of many sensitive issues the parties need to resolve themselves and that's the point of negotiations. The parties will reach agreement on all major issues."" Prior to arriving in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, on Tuesday morning, Clinton said if there are no negotiations, there will be no security for Israel and no state for the Palestinians. This isn't Clinton's first time to participate in an attempt to secure a two-state solution. As first lady, though not a principal negotiator, she traveled to the Middle East to meet with Israeli and Palestinian leaders in support of President Bill Clinton's policies on the issue. The president eventually hosted Israeli and Palestinian leaders at Camp David, Maryland, for what proved to be unsuccessful final-status talks. Now, as secretary of state, Clinton has a second chance and a more direct platform to help the parties reach a comprehensive settlement. Should Clinton help shepherd an agreement, it would ""fulfill a longtime desire to succeed in this area,"" said Ned Walker, who was U.S. ambassador to Israel during part of President Clinton's second term. ""She has something of a long history of being involved"" in the region, said Walker, who also used to be an assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs. ""This would be a great fulfillment for her personally and for the administration and the country."" CNN's Ben Wedeman, Jason Hanna and Laurie Ure contributed to this report.","NEW: Israeli and Palestinian leaders meet in Egypt .

"Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt (CNN) -- Former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, under investigation in the deaths of protesters, remained Saturday in a Sharm el-Sheikh hospital where he has been receiving treatment since Tuesday, officials said. Earlier, a military official told CNN that Mubarak had been transferred to a military facility in Cairo. However, later in the day, an official with the military in Cairo said the former leader is still in the hospital in the Red Sea resort town. Hospital and police personnel had insisted that Mubarak was still being treated at the facility and hadn't moved from a heavily guarded section of the building. ""As long as Mr. Mubarak is here, we will stay here,"" said police Capt. Karim Yusuf, one of the dozens of riot police standing in a human chain outside the Sharm el-Sheikh hospital. Justice Minister Mohamed Abdel Aziz had earlier said that when the former leader's health improves, he will be imprisoned. Despite his health issues, Mubarak has been questioned and been under investigation by the Egyptian prosecutor-general's office since Tuesday. He is being investigated in connection with the deaths of hundreds of activists during the recent uprising that led to his departure from office February 11. He is also under investigation for allegations of corruption and misuse of state funds. Mubarak has been treated at the hospital since Tuesday for heart palpitations and blood pressure problems and is listed in stable condition, officials said. He and his sons were taken into 15-day detainment Tuesday, according to a Justice Ministry spokesman. His sons are in custody in Cairo. Aziz also said Mubarak's wife, Suzanne, will be questioned by the ministry's Office of Illicit Profiteering. CNN's Ivan Watson, Mohammed Fadel Fahmy and Dina Amer contributed to this report.","NEW: A military official says Mubarak is receiving treatment at hospital .

"(EW.com) -- Henry Winkler is often called the Nicest Man in Hollywood, but now he's also known as an Honorary Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE). He was awarded the honor from the Queen this week in recognition of his services to children with dyslexia and special educational needs. According to the British Embassy in Washington, he's spent much of the last two years touring the U.K. to educate about dyslexia and other learning difficulties. Winkler, who was diagnosed with dyslexia as an adult, is also the author of 17 children's books centered on Hank Zipzer, a boy with dyslexia who overcomes his struggles at school and with bullies. There are two things I love about the press release: One, that ""Happy Days"" the show is never actually mentioned, although Sheinwald sneaks in a reference (""Henry Winkler is living proof that difficulties can be overcome and that for those suffering disability and self-doubt, happy days can nevertheless lie ahead""). And two, the sense of formality that insures you will also not see the words ""the Fonz"" or ""Fonzie"" (""Mr. Winkler's portrayal of Arthur Fonzarelli garnered him two Golden Globes and three Primetime Emmy nominations""). What I love about this in general is that it's just another wonderful, unexpected line on Winkler's rÃ©sumÃ©. It's kinda like the first time you read that he was an executive producer on ""MacGyver"" or heard that he saw the short film that ""Better Off Dead""... writer/director Savage Steve Holland had made about having suicidal thoughts after his high school girlfriend dumped him for the captain of the ski team and gave him an office so he could write it as a feature. It's easy to just think of Winkler as ""The Fonz"" instead of as a man who's also done multiple Adam Sandler movies, ""Arrested Development,"" and ""Childrens Hospital"" among other things (like wear orange shirts on ""Royal Pains""). Every now and then we like to stop and remember. See the full story at EW.com. CLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly . © 2011 Entertainment Weekly and Time Inc.

"(CNN) -- Football's world governing body FIFA has called for greater security to be provided after three players from Algeria's national football team were injured when Egyptian fans threw stones at the team bus as it arrived in Cairo on Thursday. The north African arch-rivals meet on Saturday in a crucial World Cup qualifying game in the Egyptian capital, as the group-leading Desert Foxes aim to qualify for the tournament for the first time since since 1986 at the expense of the reigning African champions. FIFA delegate, Walter Gagg, witnessed the incident and told reporters: ""We saw that three players had been injured -- Khaled Lemmouchia on the head, Rafik Halliche above the eye and Rafik Saifi on the arm. ""These weren't superficial injuries. With the stitches needed, we will have to see if these players can play. The team doctor has still to make a decision on that."" Gagg confirmed Algeria's goalkeeping coach had been concussed after the windows of the coach were smashed by stones thrown by fans. FIFA announced their concerns following the incident in a statement on their official Web site which read: ""FIFA's Organizing Committee for the FIFA World Cup have asked the Egyptian Football Association and the highest national authorities ... to confirm the implementation of the necessary additional safety and security measures at any time for the Algerian delegation. ""Last week, FIFA had officially written to the Football Associations of Algeria and Egypt to express its firm wish that the preliminary competition for the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa ends as it began, in the spirit of fair play with the necessary cooperation of all the parties."" The two north African neighbors have a history of intense competition -- the two sides locked horns in 1989 in a final qualifier for the World Cup hosted by Italy, a match that was followed by riots. Egypt, despite winning the last two Africa Cup of Nations, are on the brink of failing to qualify for the World Cup that will be held on African soil for the first time in 2010. The Pharaohs need to win by three-goals to book their place in South Africa, a two-nil win will leave the teams equal on goal difference forcing another play-off to take place on neutral ground.","Three of Algeria's players are injured as Egyptian fans throw stones at the team bus in Cairo .
