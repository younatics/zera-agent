"They may look fragile but a video has shown just how fierce and nimble the praying mantis can be. The clip shows a 'wandering violin' mantis being antagonised by its owner's thumb. It stands on its rear legs, weaves like an experienced fighter before delivering multiple strikes in an attempt to take down its human prey. Scroll down for video . The clip shows a wandering violin mantis (pictured) being antagonised by its owners thumb.

The video was uploaded by a Polish YouTube user known as Marcin Zając and begins with the mantis balanced on the edge of a hand. The insect - also known as Gongylus gongylodes - is stood on its back legs with its tibial spines tucked close to its body. When the thumb strokes the spines the mantis reacts and lifts them and its front legs above its head. It attacks the thumb twice in quick succession and when the thumb moves from left to right, the mantis ‘weaves’ in time before attacking it again. The insect, also known as Gongylus gongylodes, is stood on its back legs with its tibial spines tucked close to its body. When the thumb strokes the spines the mantis lifts them and its front legs above its head (shown) This weaving movement is also used in the wild to make the insects mimic leaves swaying in the wind. The insect in the video is believed to be a female of the wandering violin mantis species, also known as Gongylus gongylodes. It gets its name from the fact it resembles a violin, and the species is typically found in Southern India and Sri Lanka. The insects are distinctive because their ‘prothorax' or neck is more elongated and narrow than other species. When threatened, praying mantids make themselves taller and spread their appendages to make them appear larger and more imposing. In the case of the wandering violin mantis, females have wings that only cover a quarter of their abdomen. When threatened, praying mantids make themselves taller and spread their appendages to make them appear larger and more imposing. Many fan their wings and open their mouths too, and this is particularly seen on mantids who have brightly coloured or patterned wings. If they continue to feel threatened they strike to attempt to pinch and bite. Mantids do not develop wings until the final molt, while some don’t develop wings or have small flightless wings. In the case of the wandering violin mantis, which gets its name because it resembles the musical instrument, females have wings that only cover a quarter of their abdomen. Males have larger wings because they use them as part of the mating ritual when a female emits pheromones. It is believed the mantis in the video is a female. The species is distinctive because of its ‘prothorax' or neck is more elongated and narrow than some other species. They are typically found in Southern India and Sri Lanka. The movements of mantids have inspired a range of martial arts, and the Praying Mantis move was made famous in the 1984 film The Karate Kid (pictured) The mantis attacks the thumb and when the thumb moves from left to right, the mantis ‘weaves’ in time before attacking it again.

"A blame game over the ‘lacklustre’ No campaign is under way before the votes have been cast in the Scottish independence referendum. David Cameron was yesterday accused of ignoring warnings from senior officials about the chances of a Yes vote. There is also growing unease at Westminster at the last-ditch offers being made to Scotland to persuade it to stay in the UK. Scroll down for video . David Cameron, pictured,  is facing intense criticism over his handling of the Scottish independence campaign . The three main party leaders have committed to agreeing a package of further devolution, including powers over tax, spending and welfare, within six weeks of a No vote. One senior MP said: ‘It all smacks terribly of panic. Worst of all, it’s all being dictated by Gordon Brown.’ A former minister said: ‘It’s crisis politics. This is the worst example but it’s part of a pattern. The whole thing has been a total shambles.’ And Conservative MP Andrew Rosindell became the first to suggest publicly that Mr Cameron might have to consider resigning in the event of a Yes vote. He said: ‘I hope Scots vote to stay; if it goes wrong... the Prime Minister will have to decide what the honourable thing is to do.’ With frantic last-minute efforts being made to tell Scots that backing No is a positive vote for giving more powers to Edinburgh, senior figures in all three main parties are saying privately that a third option of ‘devo max’ should have been offered. Scotland’s First Minister, Alex Salmond, initially wanted a three-option ballot, but Mr Cameron insisted on a straightforward Yes/No question. Alex Salmond had wanted a three-question ballot but David Cameron insisted upon a simple Yes or No vote . Mr Salmond won concessions, rejecting the argument that expat Scots should get a vote and insisting that 16- and 17-year-olds, seen as more likely to back independence, took part. Princess Anne, right, caused speculation on a visit to Shetland yesterday – by wearing the colours of the Scottish Saltire. Dressed head to toe in white and blue, she opened a new wing of Shetland College, as part of her role as chancellor of the University of the Highlands and Islands. She has not voiced her opinion on independence, but is known to adore Scotland and often holidays there. In January 2012, Mr Cameron said the referendum should take place ‘sooner rather than later’, but Mr Salmond demanded it was put off until now. The Prime Minister sought to deflect criticism of his handling of the referendum, telling BBC2’s Newsnight on Monday: ‘I think it was right to have one question, because, of course, if Scotland wants more devolution, and I think Scotland wants more devolution, you have to answer the prior question: “Do you want to stay in the UK?” ‘Of course, that wasn’t just my view, that was the view of the leaders of other UK parties who all thought it was important, let’s settle the question of separation and then look at devolution.’ Meanwhile, the Financial Times yesterday reported claims that senior civil servants attempted to raise the alarm about the risks of the break-up of the UK. Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood and his predecessor, Lord O’Donnell, are both said to have warned that while Mr Salmond’s sole focus for two years has been building support for independence, there was a danger that Westminster would concentrate on other matters. Some Conservative backbenchers are angry that the plan to save the Union is relying on Gordon Brown . But a Downing Street source said it was ‘complete and utter nonsense’ to say that a No vote had been taken for granted, pointing out that Mr Cameron had made ten campaign visits to Scotland and the Government had published dozens of papers about the potential risks of separation. The Cabinet Office said it was ‘simply not true’ that Sir Jeremy had given such warnings. Labour leader Ed Miliband is also expected to face a leadership crisis in the event of a No vote. He agreed that the Better Together campaign should be led by former chancellor Alistair Darling, parachuting in Shadow Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander in the closing months amid concerns about its effectiveness. While more than 95 per cent of Conservative voters in Scotland are planning to vote No, working-class Labour voters are supporting independence in growing numbers. ‘There is a real battle going on for Labour votes, and it is down to Labour to win it,’ said one Government source. ‘It is up to Ed Miliband to deliver his voters.’","Tory backbenchers are concerned about the 'shambolic' no campaign .

"A U.S. university has told its students to avoid all 'offensive' costumes during this year's Halloween celebrations. In a letter from Dean of Students Christina Gonzales, students at the University of Colorado Boulder were told to consider the impact their costumes could have on others. 'White Indian': This bizarre costume is made of faux suede with a faux-fur hood and boots . Among the themes students were asked to avoid were anything that portrays a particular culture as 'over-sexualized' including Japanese geisha costumes or dressing up as a 'squaw' (indigenous woman). Also on the list were 'crude . stereotypes' such as cowboys and Indians, any costume with a sombrero, . 'white trash' and 'ghetto' associated costumes. Gonzales also asked students not to host parties that may offend others, including those with 'crime or sex work' themes. 'Making . the choice to dress up as someone from another culture, either with the . intention of being humorous or without the intention of being . disrespectful, can lead to inaccurate and hurtful portrayals of other . people's cultures,' wrote Gonzeles. According to Fox News, . University spokesman Bronson Hilliard said that while the school . condemns such costumes, students would not be punished for wearing them. 'When you dress up as a cowboy, and . you have your sheriff badge on and a big cowboy hat, that's not a . representation of a cowboy, that's not a representation of people who . work on a ranch that's not a representation of people who live in the .

Poor taste: Officials at Colorado Boulder are hoping not to see cowboys, Indians or any costumes involving a sombrero this Halloween .

"The ‘vow’ by David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband, in the left-wing Daily Record newspaper yesterday, amounts to Westminster capitulating to demands made by the Scottish left-wing establishment in recent years. Yet, despite having huge constitutional and financial implications for everybody in the UK, the three party leaders cooked them up behind closed doors without any proper debate – and with Gordon Brown at the fore. Here, Home Affairs Editor JAMES SLACK examines the ‘bribes’ which have been offered north of the border in a desperate attempt to sway tomorrow’s referendum. Scroll down for video . Desperate: The Yes vote has had a strong final push and almost all polls have the two sides neck and neck . A financial sweetener that perpetuates a system by which Scotland gets £1,623 – 19 per cent – more expenditure per head than England. The Barnett formula, devised in the 1970s by then Labour Chief Secretary to the Treasury Joel Barnett, was meant as a temporary measure to solve rows in the Callaghan government over how much money should be allocated to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. But politicians have repeatedly ducked the challenge of reforming it – mostly for fear of provoking a row with the Scots. The decision is yet another U-turn by David Cameron who said in 2008 the formula ‘cannot last forever’. The idea of resources shared ‘equitably’ will raise a hollow laugh across the rest of the UK, given the capitulation over Barnett. Unlike those living in England, Scots are already able to enjoy free social care for the elderly and free student tuition. Wales claims the decision to preserve Barnett will leave the country £300million a year poorer than if money was allocated fairly. Deal: Alex Salmond and David Cameron in 2012 signing the agreement which led to tomorrow's referendum . A counter to claims by Alex Salmond that the NHS is under threat from Westminster. The running of the health service north of the border is already the responsibility of Holyrood. But new powers – expected to allow Holyrood to vary the income tax rate by at least 15p in the pound – would allow extra money to be raised for healthcare. With Scotland in charge of every aspect of its own NHS, there is little or no justification for allowing Scottish MPs to continue to vote on the running of the NHS in England. A statement seemingly tossed out without consideration of the constitutional implications. The Scottish Parliament is the result of legislation enacted by Westminster, which could be repealed. No Parliament can bind its successor – yet the leaders are promising to do exactly that. Experts say the only way to make Holyrood permanent would be to introduce the UK’s first ever written constitution – a task that could take Parliament years to achieve. Cameron, Clegg and Miliband have no agreement among their parties to give new powers to the Scots or change the constitution. The deal has been hatched behind closed doors, with Brown taking a lead role. Mr Cameron can expect a rebellion by Tory MPs who want an English parliament in which Scots can not sway the vote on issues with no effect on their constituents. What is certain is that, in the event of a No vote, the last nine months of the current Parliament will be dominated by the fallout. There is already resentment that the vow was made in a Scottish newspaper, without any warning.","Three main parties promised £1,300 more than average spent on every Scot .

"New pictures show what life is like inside London's cat cafe, which offers stressed out city folk a unique way to unwind with a cup of tea and a chance to spend time with some chilled-out moggies. Lady Dinah's Cat Emporium is marketing itself to the many people in the city who live in small flats and who are unable to keep pets, but want a little bit of relaxing animal attention. Cat cafes first took off in Japan 10 years ago, and have since been established in areas across the UK, but this is the first to set up shop in the capital city. Scroll down for video . Lady Dinah's Cat Emporium is named after Alice's cat in Lewis Carroll's 'Alice Wonderland' book . A cat lies on the floor by a table in the newly opened Lady Dinah's Cat Emporium in London . Visitors are charged £5 for two hours of feline company in the cafe, which is an old English tea room . Named after Alice's cat in Lewis Carroll's 'Alice in Wonderland', Lady Dinah's Cat Emporium is an archetypal English tea room in east London, serving afternoon tea, sandwiches, cake and scones. However, the main draw of the cafe is the 'feline company', which costs £5 for two hours of company with some of the cafe's in-house cats. In a city where many people live alone in cramped high-rise apartment blocks that don't allow pets, making feline friends has become popular therapy for lonely or anxious workers. One customer, Sara Lewis, who spoke while stroking a cat, said: 'I can see how this would be good for someone lacking company.' Cafe owner Lauren Pears raised money for the cat emporium through crowd-funding on the internet . The cafe cost just over £100,000 to set up, and was funded largely through donations via crowd-sourcing from interested people . The cafe had a series of hiccups when setting up, including delays in planning permission of over a year . Other delays included figuring out how to manage health and safety standards in a cafe that is both serving food, and full of cats . The cafe opened last month, and is now fully booked until the end of June. It was established raised through a crowd-funding campaign on the internet, where the owner Lauren Pears racking up a massive £109,000 in donations to get it up and running. The set-up was not easy though, as Pears had to contend with figuring out how to maintain health and safety standards in a cafe serving food that is riddled with almost a dozen cats. The cafe is not the first to open in the UK, but is the first to open in London, currently set up east of the city's financial district . The idea for the cafe originally came from Japan, where animal cafes are a relatively common occurance . Cat cafes became incredibly popular in Japanese cities because many single people live in small high-rises where they can't keep pets - the cafes were a chance for feline company . The idea of the cafe is to give stressed-out Londoners who can't own pets a bit of animal therapy . The cafe currently has eleven cats in residence, all of which were given to the establishments by people leaving the country who couldn't take their pets with them . While space is dominated by a cafe setting, there is also a great deal of room employed purely for people to play with cats, and to let the cats play themselves with toys . On top of that, Pears encountered almost a year of planning permission delays, but she says the hard work has all been worth it. The 11 resident cats were donated by people leaving the country who could no longer look after them. Cat welfare in the emporium is paramount, with staff on hand who have been trained by in cat care by animal behaviorists, and the resident felines getting regular breaks away from people. Animal care is paramount at the cafe with all employees undergoing training in animal care before they start . Cat cafes are now opening up across the UK, in places like Paris, Vienna, and San Francisco . Pet therapy is becoming common in very urban areas, with many people craving relaxation from time with animals, but being unable to own them . The trend of 'animal cafes' is set to keep going, with a dog cafe planned to open in London later this year . The cat cafe has proved incredibly popular in its first month, and is now completely booked with cat visits until June . Lisa Vann brought her 8-year old daughter, who has learning difficulties, to Lady Dinah's for a playdate. Vann said: 'She's delighted to be here.' Meanwhile, across the world, animal cafe craze shows no signs of slowing down, with new establishments now open in other parts of the UK, Vienna and Paris. A dog cafe, House of Hounds, is scheduled to open in London later this year.

"Chauffeur: David Smith was found dead yesterday as he was due to stand trial for sex crimes . A former BBC driver found dead in an apparent suicide ahead of his child sex abuse trial has  'cheated' his victim of justice, a leading lawyer has today said. The body of David Smith, 67, chauffeur to disgraced DJ Jimmy Savile and other celebrities during the 1980s, was found at his south-east London home, on Monday - the eve of his court appearance. It has emerged the former driver was a prolific sex offender with a string of previous convictions for sexual offences against young boys, dating back to 1966, on his criminal record. Alan Collins, a leading child abuse lawyer, acting for about 60 of Savile's victims, told the Evening Standard: 'This was the chance for the client to be vindicated and be believed, and he will feel cheated of that. 'It is a major blow for the victim, he doesn't get to see justice being done. 'Victims have a misplaced sense of guilt, for this to happen does have a major psychological impact.' Mr Collins, of Pannone solicitors, said victims often have to psych themselves up to face their abusers at court. He said something like the suicide of the accused could leave a victim grappling with mixed emotions, feeling a sense of guilt about what has happened. Meanwhile Fiona Ellis, co-founder of Survivors in Transition, a group which aims to help people rebuild their lives in the wake of historic child sex abuse, said: ‘He was a coward and will never face justice. ‘He will never have to experience court or face judgement. ‘His victim is likely to have had to endure many difficult and painful interviews. ‘It is so rare that a case actually makes it to court and therefore a feeling of injustice is a big issue for the survivors of childhood sex abuse. ‘Quite often they have experienced layers of injustice throughout their life leading to deep-rooted issues around validation and belief.’ Police officers were called to Smith’s address after receiving a court summons on Monday at 1pm, when he failed to appear for trial. A team of detectives discovered his body in his third-floor council flat in Lewisham, south-east London, shortly after breaking in at 2.20pm. Last night a spokesman said: ‘Police attended a private address in Effingham Road, Lewisham on Monday 28 October as a man had failed to appear at Southwark Crown Court today. ‘At approximately 2.20pm officers entered the address and found the body of a man. A forensic medical examiner attended and pronounced the man dead at the scene. Next of kin are being informed. ‘Whilst officers believe they know the identity of the deceased, they await confirmation of formal identification.’ The cause of death is not yet known and the results of a post-mortem are expected imminently. Smith, of Effingham Road, Lewisham, failed to turn up at Southwark Crown Court for the start of his trial yesterday. He faced two counts of indecent assault, two of indecency with a child, and one of serious sexual assault, all relating to a 12-year-old boy, between June 1 and July 21, 1984. At a court appearance in July, Smith pleaded not guilty to all offences. Judge Alastair McCreath today ordered that the file on the case should be closed. He heard from Detective Constable Michael Wallace, the officer in the case who identified the body, that it was the same man as charged in the indictment. Probe: Smith was the first person to be charged under Operation Yewtree, the national investigation prompted after claims were made against disgraced TV presenter Jimmy Savile (pictured) The former driver was registered as a . full-time carer for his 95-year-old mother. It is understood she was not . at the flat at the time police made the discovery. She was told . of her son's death last night. It was initially thought the bad weather resulting from the violent St Jude's storm which tore across southern . England yesterday morning, could have caused Smith's no-show at court at 10.30am yesterday. A . warrant was issued for his arrest after defence barrister Sandy . Canavan raised concerns that her client had not appeared, without any . explanation and despite repeated attempts to contact him by phone. She . said: ‘He has been regularly in contact, I am concerned at the lack of . contact. He is the sole carer for his very aged and very unwell mother, . that may have affected why he’s not here today.’ Judge McCreath said: ‘He needs to be here, if his mother’s poorly or not.’ He . issued a bench warrant, backed for bail, with the condition that he . surrender to the court by 9.30am today, with the case to be listed for . 10am. Smith was the first person to . be charged under Operation Yewtree, the national investigation prompted . after claims were made against disgraced TV presenter Savile. Convicted: David Smith had a string of past sexual offences against young boys  on his criminal record . He was due to be the first of those arrested under the operation, which was launched in October last year, to face a jury. It was said Smith met his victim at a swimming pool and invited him back to his flat where he sexually abused him. He also took the boy on a visit to the BBC studios at White City in west London. The boy claimed he was indecently assaulted during the journey. Smith was arrested on December 10, last year, after his victim's partner . contacted police after she saw his response to the ITV documentary . Exposure: The Other Side Of Jimmy Savile - broadcast on October 3, 2012. He was later bailed and 11 days later the case was passed to the Crown Prosecution Service. On April 3, following further police inquiries requested by the CPS, Smith was charged. A . previous attempt to snare Smith in 2002 had failed when police could . not find him, despite the fact he was in prison at the time. Smith was a prolific sex offender. His criminal record reveals 22 convictions for sexual offences against young boys dating back to the first in 1966, the BBC reported. Scotland Yard has led the probe, separating its investigations into three strands. The first focuses on Savile's crimes, while a second relates to allegations against Savile and others. The third strand - the one under which Smith was being investigated - concerns accusations which have emerged as a result of the publicity surrounding Savile, but which are unconnected to the pervert DJ. Operation Yewtree was launched by police after the ITV documentary interviewed victim's of Savile's abuse. The programme led to 600 people coming forward with information about historic cases of abuse - three-quarters of which related to Savile, who was 84 when he died in 2011. Savile's crimes spanned 54 years and the scale of abuse was 'believed to be unprecedented in the UK'. At the time of Smith's arrest, BBC News reported that he had worked as a driver for the broadcaster and possibly other employers. But a BBC press office spokesman said she was unable to confirm whether he had been formally employed by the organisation, as the Corporation's records do not go back as far as 1984. A BBC spokesman said: 'On searches carried out to date, we have not found any record of David Smith being employed by or working for the BBC. 'We have been assisting the police in relation to David Smith and will continue to do so.'","David Smith, 67, was chauffeur to Savile and other celebrities in 1980s .

"People who have lucid dreams have superior problem-solving skills, scientists claim. Researchers say that people who can recognise that they are dreaming while being sound asleep, can solve problems in the waking world better than those who remain unaware of the dream until they wake up. This is because they are have an extra level of insight, according to a new study. Researchers say that people who have lucid dreams - those who can recognise that they are dreaming while being sound asleep (stock image) - can solve problems in the waking world better than those who remain unaware of the dream until they wake up . The concept of lucid dreaming was thrust into the spotlight in the 2010 film Inception, where dreamers were able to spot incongruities within their dream. Experts believe that some people have lucid dreams because they have an extra level of insight. This means that their brains detect they are in a dream because events would not make sense otherwise. This cognitive ability translates to the waking world when it comes to finding the solution to a problem, by spotting hidden connections or inconsistencies, according to scientists at the University of Lincoln. The concept of lucid dreaming was thrust into the spotlight in the 2010 film Inception, where dreamers were able to spot incongruities within their dream. A screenshot of the film, starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt is shown . Lucid dreams suggest that a person has superior problem solving abilities when they are awake, according to this latest study. And the content of dreams has been interpreted since the ancient conisations of Egypt and Greece, where dreaming was considered a supernatural intervention. In Ancient Greece, dreams were considered prophetic or omens. A 16th century Chinese book on dreams raised the question of lucidity - how we know we are dreaming and how we know we are awake, . In his famous book, The Interpretation of Dreams, Sigmund Freud argued that the motivation of all dream content is wish-fulfilment and that the root of a dream is found in the events of the day preceding the dream, which he called the 'day residue.' He suggested that adult dreams could not be easily interpreted by the individual who had them, but that the dreams expressed latent thoughts in their subconscious. Later, Carl Jung said that dreams shed light on the unconscious of a person and their world and could contain hidden symbols. The study, published in the American Psychological Association’s journal, Dreaming, is the first empirical study to demonstrate the relationship between lucid dreaming and insight. ‘It is believed that for dreamers to become lucid while asleep, they must see past the overwhelming reality of their dream state, and recognise that they are dreaming,’ said Dr Patrick Bourke, senior lecturer at the Lincoln School of Psychology. ‘The same cognitive ability was found to be demonstrated while awake by a person’s ability to think in a different way when it comes to solving problems.’ The study examined 68 participants aged between 18 and 25 who had experienced different levels of lucid dreaming - from never to several times a month.

"Two men have been arrested as part of a police investigation into an alleged VIP paedophile ring at a care home and guest house in south-west London. Officers from the Metropolitan Police swooped on a home in St Leonards-on-Sea in East Sussex this morning and arrested 70-year-old John Stingemore, who formerly worked for Richmond council. Another man, a 66-year-old from Norfolk, was also arrested on suspicion of sexual offences, according to the Met, and both are currently in police custody. The two men were taken to Belgravia Police Station in London for questioning. Arrests: 70-year-old John Stingemore, left, and a 66-year-old man, right, have been questioned by police over an alleged paedophile ring dating back to the 1980s . Peter Spindler, head of the Specialist Crime Investigations, said: 'This is a complex multi agency investigation supported by the NSPCC, CEOP and Richmond Social Services involving non-recent allegations of sexual assault against children.' Stingemore is believed to be a former deputy of head of Grafton Close children's home in Richmond, which is at the centre of the abuse allegations. Operation Fernbridge was launched with the help of Labour MP Tom Watson to investigate claims that a group of senior 'Establishment' figures sexually abused . boys in council care throughout the 1980s. Former . ministers, senior MPs, top police officers and those with links to the . royal household are alleged to have indecently assaulted vulnerable, . under-age males at a care home and nearby guest house. Carer: Stingemore is believed to have been deputy head of Grafton Close children's home in Richmond . Questioned: The 66-year-old man is rumoured to be a Roman Catholic priest . Raid: Child sex allegations centre around the former Elm Guest House in Barnes, pictured; the claims do not relate to the current occupants of the building . It is claimed that boys living at Grafton Close were taken to Elm Guest House in nearby Barnes where they were subjected to appalling sexual abuse. One frequent visitor to the guest house is said to have been Liberal MP Cyril Smith, who is widely believed to have abused the teenage boys who lived in a hostel run by him. A . spokesman for Richmond Council, which ran the care home, said: . 'Richmond Council considers the safeguarding of all children and young . people as an utmost priority and we take any allegations of abuse very . seriously. 'As such we . are offering our full support and co-operation to the police during . their investigation. As the investigation is ongoing, it would be . inappropriate to comment further at this time.' Director . of the NSPCC helpline Peter Watt said: 'We are assisting the police on . Operation Fernbridge and are asking anyone with information to come . forward. 'We will . assist the police in gathering evidence and supporting those who come . forward. It's important we recognise the massive impact abuse has on . children and young people, often well into their adult life.' Responding to a report that the man . arrested in Norfolk is a Catholic priest, Father Mark Hackeson from the . Diocese of East Anglia said: 'The church diocese takes safeguarding of . children very seriously and so we will be co-operating fully in any way . with the police investigation.' Detectives . launched the probe after they obtained a . list of ‘prominent people’ who allegedly stayed at the guest house in . the 1980s, compiled by a veteran child protection campaigner. Visitor: Liberal MP and suspected paedophile Cyril Smith is said to have been to the guest house . Allegations of child abuse in the early 1980s at the Elm Guest House, in Barnes, London were made by Tom Watson MP in the House of Commons . Grafton Close shut more than 20 years ago and police have stressed . that the abuse claims are historic and are not linked with the current . occupants of Elm Guest House, which has been converted into flats. Allegations over Elm Guest House first emerged at a 1990 inquest into the suicide of its German manager Carole Kasir. Child protection campaigners said at the hearing that in 1988 she told . them boys from council-run Grafton Close had been taken to the . guesthouse and abused. Mrs Kasir had a 1982 conviction for running a brothel. But campaigners . said the manager had no idea at the time of the child abuse. Arrest: Officers from the Met have arrested two men as part of an investigation into an alleged paedophile ring . Officers working on the probe are liaising with Mr . Watson, who told the Commons in October that politicians belonging to a . paedophile network had used their powerful connections to escape . justice. He sensationally claimed a ‘senior aide of a former prime . minister’ had links to a member of a child sex ring. He added that a file of evidence used to convict a man called Peter . Righton of importing child pornography in 1992 contained ‘clear . intelligence’ of a sex abuse gang. In a statement, Scotland Yard said Operation Fernbridge would be led by the Child Abuse Investigation Command. It added: ‘The allegations under Operation Fernbridge were initially . assessed under Operation Fairbank which was information passed to police . by MP Tom Watson. Operation Fernbridge reached the threshold for a . criminal investigation.’ Scotland Yard are still seeking further leads on the investigation, and have urged anyone with information to call the NSPCC on 0808 800 5000 or contact their local police force.

"Some United Airlines flight attendants will soon be getting some seriously fat pay checks now that the struggling, over-staffed air carrier has reached a severance deal with its employee union. United spokeswoman Megan McCarthy said Monday that the airline hopes that at least 2,100 of its 23,000 flight attendants will accept an offer that could be worth as much as $100,000. All for just walking away and never looking back. The agreement comes six years after United, which employs more than 23,000 stewards, retired a number of its planes, leaving the company 2,000-plus flight attendants above capacity. Letting them go: United spokeswoman Megan McCarthy said Monday that the airline hopes that at least 2,100 of its 23,000 flight attendants will accept an offer that could be worth as much as $100,000 . While some 1,450 were still on unpaid leave for the company this month, United said Monday that it now is recalling all of its attendants so they may apply for the separation payment or return to work. The Association of Flight Attendants, which represents United's stewards, lauded the high-paying severance as 'virtually unprecedented in the airline industry.' United's cooperation with AFA bodes well for contract negotiations that have been going on since the carrier merged with Continental Airlines in 2010. The relative seniority of each carrier's flight attendants has yet to be determined, and despite a single operating certificate, United and Continental stewards have not yet integrated. 'Recalling furloughed flight attendants and aligning our staffing to match our flying schedule will further facilitate the company and AFA reaching a joint collective bargaining agreement,' said Mike Bonds, United's executive vice president for human resources and labor relations, in a statement. 'It's another positive step in what has become a productive relationship with AFA.' The deal also has the potential to cut United's costs if the carrier replaces senior flight attendants who accept the severance with junior ones hired at a lower pay grade, according to industry consultant George Hamlin. Overstaffed: The agreement comes six years after United, which employs more than 23,000 stewards, retired a number of its planes, leaving the company 2,000-plus flight attendants above capacity. Still, Hamlin offered a word of caution. 'Why did it take so long to get to this?' he said, adding that United and Continental 'still have to come up with a way to deploy all (of their) flight attendants as one entity.' The airline has made separate collective bargaining agreements with its pilots, fleet service and passenger service groups. Chicago-based United, the nation's second-biggest airline operator behind American Airlines Group Inc., has been shrinking slightly - about 3 percent in passenger-carrying capacity since 2011, not counting United Express flights. United announced last year that it planned to cut spending by $2 billion per year to boost earnings. Operating expenses were $37 billion last year. United's stock fell almost 1.7 percent Monday to close at $49.56 per share. The announcement came out after the close of New York trading .","Chicago-based United is looking to get rid a chunk of its over 23,000 flight attendants .

"Wind farms will never be able to ensure the nation’s lights stay on because they are ‘expensive and deeply inefficient’, it is claimed today. Confirming the long-held fears of many critics, a new study published by the right-leaning Adam Smith Institute and the Scientific Alliance argues the green energy revolution has been an expensive folly. Researchers found that, on average, wind farms produce 80 per cent of their potential power output for less than one week annually – and they manage 90 per cent output for only 17 hours a year. Ineffective: Thousands of turbines are useless in low winds and they are turned off to prevent damage if the speeds are too high. Above, file image of Carno wind farm, Wales . Thousands of turbines are useless in low winds and they are turned off to prevent damage if the speeds are too high. Families and businesses have paid billions of pounds to subsidise the building of wind farms, both on-shore and off-shore, through their energy bills, sending tariffs soaring. The schemes are key to the Government’s promise to switch to green energy, reducing the nation’s carbon emissions in line with British and EU targets to tackle man-made global warming. The study, entitled Wind Power Reassessed: A review of the UK wind resource for electricity generation, recommends pushing ahead with nuclear power and gas-fired power stations. Ben Southwood, Head of Policy at the Adam Smith Institute, said: ‘Wind farms are a bad way of reducing emissions and a bad way of producing power. ‘They are expensive and deeply inefficient and it seems like they reduce the value of housing enormously in nearby areas. Promise: The Conservatives have already pledged to end subsidies for new wind farms as Britain is set to meet EU targets, which decree that 15 per cent of energy is generated by renewable sources by 2020. (File image) Defending turbines, trade body RenewableUK claimed: ‘Wind power has been quietly powering millions of homes and providing a robust response to detractors.’ The Conservative party has already pledged to end subsidies for new wind farms as Britain is set to meet EU targets. The EU Renewable Energy Target decrees that 15 per cent of all energy in the UK - or 30 to 35 per cent of electricity - is generated by renewable sources by 2020. The Department for Energy and Climate Change said the country needs a wide mix of energy sources. It said: ‘We're preventing a predicted energy crunch by turning round a legacy of underinvestment and neglect. ‘To deliver this, we need a diverse energy mix that includes renewable sources like wind and solar alongside nuclear and technologies like carbon capture and storage so we can continue to use fossil fuels in a cleaner way.’","Wind farms produce 90% of potential power output for only 17 hours a year .

"President Barack Obama is losing the war of words when it comes to radical Islam, experts warn, and he may want to abandon his campaign to separate terrorists in the Middle East from their religion. Obama has been adamant that the religion of militants affiliated with ISIS is irrelevant even as other world leaders have labeled them Islamic extremists. Bombarded by criticism, the U.S. president dedicated speeches at the White House counter-terrorism summit on Wednesday and Thursday to defending his administration's stance. But even the name of 1600 Pennsylvania's confab - the Summit on Countering Violent Extremism - suggests the militants are more than just terrorists - they're religious 'extremists,' Obama's critics say, and it's 'self-deception' to pretend otherwise. Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama speaks at the White House Summit to Counter Violent Extremism at the State Department on Thursday. He again tried to explain his administration's stance on violent extremism in his remarks . 'Obama’s reaching a point where he may have to ditch this almost scholastic position,' Akbar Ahmed, chairman of Islamic studies at American University, told the New York Times. 'He sounds like a distinguished professor in the ivory tower, and he may have to come down into the hurly-burly of politics,' Ahmed warned. Peter Wehner, deputy director of speech writing for President George W. Bush, told the Times that part of what Obama is facing is 'a semantic battle, but it’s a semantic battle that goes to deeper issues.' 'Self-deception is not a good idea in politics or international affairs. We’re lying to ourselves, and the world knows it,' Wehner, now a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, added. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani on Wednesday appeared to question Obama's patriotism over the matter. 'I do not believe, and I know this is a horrible thing to say, but I do not believe that the president loves America,' Giuliani said during a dinner for conservatives at 21 Club in Manhattan, according to Politico. 'He doesn’t love you. And he doesn’t love me. He wasn’t brought up the way you were brought up and I was brought up through love of this country.' Giuliani, a 2008 candidate for the Republican nomination to the presidency, said Obama has 'to be able to criticize Islam for the parts of Islam that are wrong.' Referring to remarks Obama made at a prayer breakfast several weeks ago, he charged, 'You criticize Christianity for the part of Christianity that is wrong.' 'I’m not sure how wrong the Crusades are,' Giuliani mused. 'The Crusades were kind of an equal battle between two groups of barbarians. The Muslims and the crusading barbarians. 'What the hell? What’s wrong with this man that he can’t stand up and say there’s a part of Islam that’s sick?' he asked. Giuliani backtracked on Thursday morning and said he is 'not questioning [Obama's] patriotism.' 'He’s a patriot, I’m sure,' Giuliani said on Fox and Friends. 'What I’m saying is, in his rhetoric, I very rarely hear the things that I used to hear Ronald Reagan say, the things that I used to hear Bill Clinton say about how much he loves America.' But he stuck to his guns on the need for Obama to 'connect the dots' when it comes to radicals and Islamism. 'If you refuse to say that there are extremist members of the Islamic religion, well then, it sounds like you’re living on Mars,' he said. On Fox News Wednesday night Texas Sen. Ted Cruz blasted Obama as an 'apologist for radical Islamic terrorists.' Cruz accused the administration of having a 'false moral relativism' and invoked Obama's prayer breakfast speech. 'Now last I checked, the Crusades began a millennia ago, and I don’t think it’s too much to ask the president to stay in the current millennium,' Cruz said, per Politico. The freshman senator and probable Republican presidential candidate said Obama should look to Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, a Muslim who has spoken out against violent fundamentalists associated with his religion, as a model. 'Why don’t we see the president of the United States demonstrating that same courage just to speak the truth about the face of evil we’re facing right now?' Cruz asked. A demonstrator stands in front of the White House during the White House counter-terror summit on Wednesday holding a sign criticizing President Obama for his refusal to call label violent extremists by their religion . The president spent the better part of a 30 minute speech on Wednesday explaining that, in his administration's view, it only legitimizes Al Qaeda and ISIS to acknowledge their religious affiliation. 'They try to portray themselves as religious leaders - holy warriors in defense of Islam,' he said. That's why ISIS wants to be called the 'Islamic State.' Furthermore, 'they propagate the notion that America - and the West, generally - is at war with Islam. That’s how they recruit. That’s how they try to radicalize young people,' Obama asserted. 'We must never accept the premise that they put forward, because it is a lie. Nor should we grant these terrorists the religious legitimacy that they seek. They are not religious leaders -- they’re terrorists,' he said to applause. 'And we are not at war with Islam. We are at war with people who have perverted Islam.' Obama dug in his heels in remarks at the summit on Thursday, saying the world cannot give in to terrorists 'especially their attempt to use Islam to justify their violence.' 'These terrorists are desperate for legitimacy, and all of us have a responsibility to refute the notion that groups like ISIL somehow represent Islam,' Obama said during a speech at the State Department. 'Because that is a falsehood that embraces the terrorist narrative.' Obama chastised the media for not portraying Muslims in a more positive light. Because many Americans don't personally know a Muslim, they go off what they see in the news, he contended. And 'given the existing news cycle, that can give a very distorted impression.' 'A lot of the bad,' he said, 'like terrorists who claim to speak for Islam, that's absorbed by the population, and not enough of the good. Muslim-American Mahroh Jahangiri, left, joins a group of protesters gathered in front of the White House on Wednesday during a rally to bring awareness of how  the White House's Countering Violent Extremism summit and measures single out Muslims, regardless of whether it calls militants radical Islamasists . Even as the president has been hit from the right for not drawing a strong enough time between ISIS and Islamism, he has also been hit from Muslim communities over summit speakers' focus on acts of terror committed by groups with roots in Islam. A group of Muslim-Americans protested outside the White House on Wednesday in the bitter cold to bring awareness to their argument - that the Obama administration is unfairly singling out Muslims in its fight against ISIS. The White House admitted on Wednesday that it was 'very mindful' of the fact that a 'particularly virulent strain of extremist ideology has tried to insert itself in the Muslim community.' 'There’s no question about that,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said. 'That's true in the United States; that's true in other places around the world. And that will be the subject of extensive discussion at the summit.' Obama said Thursday that the coalition against ISIS must also acknowledge that radicals are 'deliberately targeting their propaganda' at Muslim communities, particularly young people of that faith. Muslims need to refute the notion 'that we are the cause of every ill in the Middle East,' Obama argued, because that narrative has also become a foundation for ISIS to try to justify its violence.'","Obama dedicated speeches at the White House counter-terrorism summit on Wednesday and Thursday to defending his administration's stance .

"'Teleporting' physical objects over distances instantaneously  - like the transporter in Star Trek - has been brought a step closer thanks to a new prototype that uses a 3D printer. The device, dubbed 'Scotty', digitises an object in one place, destroying it in the process, and rebuilds it in another location. Named after the operator of the transporter in the hit sci-fi TV series, Scotty scans an object layer by layer and sends its encrypted digital blueprint to a 3D printer for it to be reassembled. Scroll down for video . The prototype teleporter scans the object  using a digital camera, destroying the original object in the process by slicing it apart layer by layer . Users merely have to place an object into the device, select a recipient, and press the 'relocate' button, and the object will be sent to a new location to be reconstructed. 'Scotty is a simple self-contained appliance that allows teleporting inanimate physical objects across distance,' said the researchers, who are based in  the Hasso Plattner Institute in Germany. The original object is destroyed in order to preserve its 'uniqueness', rather than simply copying it. This enhances the emotional value of physical objects shared between friends, according to the researchers, as the transported item is no longer just a copy, but the only version in existence. A hand crafted pendant is dipped in black paint to increase the contrast for the digital scan before being placed into Scotty. The sender presses a single button to initiate the 'teleportation' process . Scotty uses a digital camera to scan the item, before shaving off a layer using a built-in milling machine. It then repeats the process, until the original is destroyed. But as it slices and scans on one end, the layers are sent via encrypted connection to the 3D printer at the item's destination, where it is rebuilt by 'printing' the layers in plastic. So far Scotty can only 'teleport' one type of material - plastic - so we are still a long way from beaming ourselves to other planets. But in destroying the original, Scotty also attempts to solve another  tricky problem. The device has been named 'Scotty' after the head engineer aboard the Star Ship Enterprise in classic sci-fi series Star Trek. Scotty operated the transporter, which 'beamed' the crew onto planets . The original object is scanned as Scotty slices it apart, destroying it in the process. The digital blueprint is then sent to be printed in another location over an encrypted connection . Star Trek-style 'beaming up' through space could become a reality sometime in the far future. Nothing in the laws of physics fundamentally forbids the teleportation of large objects, including humans, researchers claim. Professor Hanson, from Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, was able to transport an atom 9.8ft (three metres) with 100 per cent accuracy in May 2014. In Professor Hanson's experiment, three entangled particles - a nitrogen atom locked in a diamond crystal and two electrons - were used to transfer spin information. 'What we are teleporting is the state of a particle,' Proffesor Hanson said. 'If you believe we are nothing more than a collection of atoms strung together in a particular way, then in principle it should be possible to teleport ourselves from one place to another. As 3D printing technology advances, leaked designs of a printable item could lead to physical objects being pirated and copied in much the same way as digital music. By destroying the original, the researchers hope to address this concern, potentially allowing trinkets bought on eBay to be sent instantaneously. 'When the seller sends the object through Scotty, the system guarantees that the seller’s object ceases to exist the moment the buyer receives it,' said the researchers. 'Scotty allows transferring objects quickly without infringing on designers’ rights to be paid for their designs,' they added. While Scotty sounds impressive, there are limitations to the prototype teleporter. Scotty can currently only print in plastic and in one colour, and objects must be painted black in order to maximise the contrast for the digital camera to 'scan' it. But as 3D printing technology becomes more refined, the range and resolution of what 'teleporters' like Scotty can send and receive will only improve. Nasa engineers created this helpful guide and cartoon to explain the complex system: . How quantum teleportation works is complicated, but an analogy for the principle behind it may help: Let's say there are two people, Alice and Bob. Alice wants Bob to have a photon that's in the same 'state' as her photon, which we'll call photon P. For the sake of this analogy, we'll pretend that the 'state' is a colour, and photon P is yellow. A third person named Charlie sends out two entangled photons, photon A to Alice and photon B to Bob, which behave as if they are part of the same whole. Both of these photons start out as blue. Alice's two photons, P, which is yellow, and A, which is blue, 'collide.' Alice measures the photons as they annihilate one another. Although P and A are destroyed in the crash, P's yellow colour is preserved. Because photon A and photon B are entangled, the yellow colour is 'teleported' to B. But in order to get photon B to become yellow, as photon P originally was, Alice needs to send Bob two bits of information to B the 'classical' way - for example, by sending pulses of light over an optical fibre. 'When Alice measures the state of her photon, Bob's photon changes state as well, as if flipping a switch,' Marsili said. 'But Bob cannot know how the switch flipped unless Alice sends him the bits of information classically.' Bob does not know that his photon has changed to yellow without that additional information.","Device dubbed 'Scotty' scans objects  to be 'teleported' at click of a button .

Retinitis pigmentosa is a rare hereditary condition affecting 10,000 people in Britain - it gradually destroys the retina, the light- sensitive layer at the back of the eye. The condition causes permanent changes to vision but how quickly this happens and how it changes differs between people. In most of the more common forms of retinitis pigmentosa, the first symptoms occur between childhood and the age of 30. The first symptom you is people with the condition find it difficult to see in poor light, such as outdoors at dusk, or in a dimly lit room. This is often referred to as 'night blindness'. While most people find it takes their eyes about 20 minutes to adapt to dim light, a person with the condition will find it will either take much longer or it won't happen at all. A second symptom is the loss of some o peripheral vision or peripheral visual field. This means that when the person is looking straight ahead they become less able to see things either to the side, above or below. Currently, there is no known cure or treatment for RP or associated retinal disorders. Source: RNIB .

"A father has revealed in a brutally honest interview how he came to love the daughter with Down Syndrome that he had tried to get his wife to abort. Heath White, a pilot-turned-FBI agent from Waskom, Texas, said that his five-year-old daughter Paisley - one of three children - is now 'the light in the darkness' and an inspiration to his family. But this was not his sentiment in 2007 when he learned his wife Jennifer was carrying a baby with Downs, which was totally at odds with his image of a perfect family. Speaking to ESPN, he explained that he had always aimed for perfection - playing for sports teams throughout college, achieving a 4.0, enrolling in law school before coming a pilot - and the girl threatened to ruin that. Scroll down for video . A father's love: Heath White has revealed how he wanted his wife to abort their daughter, Paisley, who has Down Syndrome. In a brutally honest interview, he revealed how he came to love her . 'My main concern was what people would think about me - what weakness inside me caused that,' he said. 'Learning you're having a child with Downs . is like experiencing a death, that's what I felt like. Like I was . getting a broken baby.' He explained he did everything he could to try to force Jennifer to have an abortion and, while she said he was never abusive to her, she acknowledge he was not supportive. She described her own turmoil that the love of her life didn't want the child that she knew she wanted so much - and she made it clear to him that it was the baby or a life without them. Paisley was born on March 16, 2007, joining her big sister and her parents. But while he smiled in photographs, White said he did not feel connected to his daughter. He remembered how his mother commented that the little girl looked like she didn't even have Downs - and how he felt it was a lie. At odds: White explained that he had always aimed for perfection, so when his wife Jennifer, right, told him the baby had Down Syndrome, he did everything he could to get her to have an abortion - but she said no . Expecting: The couple, who already had one daughter, are pictured before Paisley's birth in March 2007 . New addition: Jennifer said the minute she began feeding Paisley for the first time, she knew she was perfect . It was only months later that he realized Paisley was no different from any other child. 'The turning point - I had her down and I tickled her and she laughed and giggled at me and tried to push me away,' he remembered. 'Her laughing and smiling and reacting with me, that's when I realized she's just like any other kid - she's my kid.' He realized that he wanted to show the world just how proud of being her father he was. Before her birth, he had taken part in competitive races for years, but stopped when she arrived. He realized it was something they could do together - him running and pushing her in a special stroller. Their first race took place just before her first birthday and they continued to achieve medals over the next five years - taking part in nine marathons as well as numerous 5K and 10K races. 'It was just me and her, nothing between us,' White said. 'Looking back on the pictures of running with her, that's a good memory.' Inner battle: He said he immediately saw his daughter had Downs and could not bond with her . Realization: But he said when she was a few months old, he tickled her and she laughed and pushed back - and he realized she was like every other kid. 'She's my kid,' he said . Happy together: He said he wanted to show how proud he was of his daughter so came up with a plan . Footage from the races shows Paisley giggling with glee and waving to spectators - or simply sitting back an enjoying the ride - as her father carries them to the finish line. As she turns five, he has now decided to let her run for herself - and knows she will have no problem doing so. Together, they ran 321 miles in races - which is significant as Down Syndrome is the 3rd copy of the 21 chromosome. The couple went on to have another girl and are again pregnant - with their fourth daughter. When Paisley was 18 months old, White began writing a letter to Paisley, he shared with ESPN, detailing his conflicted feelings about her birth and how he now loves her beyond words. He said that, while he knows the letter could upset her in the future, he hopes it also shows her just how much he loves her - and that it tells other worried parents that they are not alone. Team: For years, they ran marathons and road races together, with White proudly pushing Paisley . Joy: He said that when she was five, he realized she no longer needed him to carry her places . Big sister: Paisley is pictured with her two sisters. The family is now expecting a fourth girl . 'Nobody knew the way I felt before she was born, and if I can keep one family, one person from having to live with the guilt and almost making the mistake that I almost made, it's going to be worth the pain that Paisley will feel later in life knowing the way that I felt,' he said. He added that while he has not read the letter to her yet, he does plan to. 'It was just my way of repenting,' he said. 'Chances are that she never would have known the way I felt before she was born. That could have been my dirty secret that I kept with me forever. 'But I didn't want it to be a secret, I wanted her to know that she was everything to me... My love for Paisley is perfect.' Jennifer White also spoke of the change she had seen in her husband. 'Initially Heath had said, ""I don't want to take care of somebody for the rest of my life"",' she told ESPN. 'I think now he looks at it and says, ""Oh my goodness, I may not get to take care of her the rest of her life"".' See below for video .","Heath White, a pilot and FBI agent, said he had always sought perfection - and a Down syndrome child did not fit into that picture .

"A blustering winter storm that dropped nearly 2 feet of snow just north of Boston, shut down major highways in New York and Pennsylvania and forced U.S. airlines to cancel thousands of flights nationwide menaced the Northeast on Friday with howling winds and frigid temperatures. The brutal weather - which brought plummeting temperatures to some areas that forecasters predicted could see highs just above zero and wind chill readings of minus 10 degrees and colder by early on Friday - dumped 21 inches of snow in Boxford, Massachusetts, by late Thursday and 18 inches in parts of western New York near Rochester. Up to 7 inches fell in New York City by Friday morning. The snowfall, frigid cold and stiff winds extended the holiday break for some students for a second day while posing the first test for New York City’s new mayor and perhaps the last challenge for Boston’s outgoing one. U.S. airlines canceled around 4,000 flights because of the snowfall and low visibility.

"A cancer surgeon was found slumped at the wheel of his car with a half empty bottle of vodka on what would have been his 10th wedding anniversary - two years after losing his wife to the very disease he specialises in. A passer-by found bowel cancer specialist Nicholas Harrison, of Coven, Staffordshire, slumped in his car parked on double-yellow lines with the engine running last month. The 43-year-old lost his wife and mother-of-three Gemma Harrison to a neuroendocrine tumour of the bowel, a rare form of cancer which spread to her liver and lung. The 34-year-old died in August 2012, four months after she was diagnosed. Cancer surgeon Nicholas Harrison was found slumped in his car on what would have been his 10th wedding anniversary. His wife Gemma Harrison, a mother-of-three, died two years ago from a form of the disease he specialises in . Police officers administered a breath test and found Harrison was more than three times the drink drive limit. Magistrates at North Staffordshire Justice Centre heard he was heartbroken after the death of his wife. Harrison's lawyer Paul Kay told magistrates: 'This is an exceptional case with a tragic background. He had drunk to numb the pain of a tragic day.' Now the 43-year-old surgeon at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire has been hit with a 12-month driving ban. At an . earlier hearing, Kay told the court: 'It would be a devastating blow to . anybody, but he was a specialist in the very cancer she was suffering . from.' Mrs . Harrison, a nurse who met her husband through work, had started organising a fund-raising event for the . Royal Free Hospital in London where she was treated before she died. Her . friends and family set up a charity called Remember Gemma Always, which . has raised £20,000 for the hospital, which specialises in . neuroendocrine tumours. Runners line up for a charity fundraising event in Mrs Harrison's memory . Tribute: A balloon release organised by a charity set up in Mrs Harrison's memory, which has raised more than £20,000 to combat the cancer that killed her . Mrs Harrison's friend Sally Miles heads the charity. She said: 'We met through our children and clicked instantly, so watching her so poorly was hard.' The charity's website states: 'Gemma’s relatives and friends want to remember her for her positive influence on so many lives and fulfil her desire to fund research into this rare cancer and provide support to both patients and their families suffering with this wicked illness.' Mourner Louise Neale posted on a death notice in the Express and Star: 'Such a wonderful lady and a very special friend. You will always be in our hearts.' Lee Wedge added: 'A beautiful woman who will be sadly missed by family and friends. Deeply saddened.' The court also heard Harrison, a graduate of the University of Birmingham, was well-liked at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire where he works. Hospital officials declined to comment on the case. Officials at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire, where Harrison works, refused to comment . Neuroendocrine tumours are cancers that grow in hormone producing tissues, usually in the digestive system. They are rare. The endocrine system is a network of glands and organs in the body that produce hormones. The tumours usually develop slowly over a number of years. Many people don’t have symptoms at first. It is not unusual for people to find that a neuroendocine cancer has already spread to another part of the body when they are diagnosed. There is some debate among doctors about how neuroendocrine tumours should be grouped and what they should be called. Although they develop from the same types of cell, they develop in different organs in the body. They also behave in different ways, for example some are slow growing while others are faster growing.Source: Cancer Research UK .","Nicholas Harrison was three times over the limit when found by a passer-by .

"Shock: Clean-living grandmother-of-two Melanie had no idea how she could have contracted Hepatitis C . Hepatitis C can seem like a disease other people get. The virus is traditionally associated with tattoos and intravenous drug use, and Keith Richards and Pamela Anderson are amongst those who have suffered with it. Imagine, then, how clean-living grandmother-of-two Melanie Dymock felt when she discovered she had it, following blood tests after a heart operation in 2010. 'My GP was dumbstruck and so was I,' says Melanie, 50, from Dagenham, east London. 'I've never used drugs or had any tattoos and I had no symptoms - I felt fine. I had no idea where I could have got it from.' Hepatitis C is contracted by blood to blood contact, and once in the body, the virus causes liver cirrhosis and failure. It raises the risk of liver cancer, too, because it kills cells, causing a high turnover of new cells, meaning more chance of mutation. However, it takes 30 years on average after infection for cirrhosis to set in, and frighteningly, it is symptomless until then. 'My doctor asked if I'd ever had a blood transfusion,' says Melanie, a GP receptionist who lives with her long-term partner. 'And I had - I was born with a heart defect and so I'd had an operation on it when I was 16. I also had a transfusion when I had my daughter in 1982, because I lost a lot of blood. 'He said it must be that, because they only started screening blood used in transfusions in 1992. It was pretty scary that I'd had it all that time without realising. The doctors said if it hadn't been picked up, within five years I'd have had cirrhosis of the liver.' Experts are warning that the UK is about to see an explosion of cases like Melanie's, where people who caught hepatitis C during its peak in the 1970s and 1980s are only now discovering they have it. New diagnoses of the virus shot up by a third between 2010 and 2012 in England, according to Public Health England. Intravenous drug use and blood transfusions are the most common causes, but the virus can be caught through medical procedures, including dental work, and tattoos and piercings. This is less of a risk now in the UK, but it's still a major threat if you have such procedures in certain countries where sterilisation standards are poor. It can also, more rarely, be passed from one to another through sharing toothbrushes (if the gums bleed) and razors. Frightening: One of the early symptoms of Hepatitis C is tiredness, a symptom that many people disregard . This summer it was revealed that thousands of women in England were at risk of hepatitis C after it emerged that a retired gynaecologist had practised for years while unknowingly carrying the virus. Two patients are already confirmed to have been infected although the risk is very low, since it would need to involve the doctor scratching him or herself during an operation. The condition is curable, so doctors are urging those who may be at risk - including anyone who had a blood transfusion before 1992 - to get themselves tested. Although all donated blood is now screened for hepatitis C, it wouldn't show up if you were having a routine blood test for something else. You'd need to be specifically tested for the hepatitis C virus to find out. 'The liver has an an extraordinary repair capacity, so it can take decades for any problems to develop,' says Graham Foster, professor of hepatology at Queen Mary University of London. 'It's like the petrol tank in your car - it will run at 100 miles per hour but then when the final drop of petrol goes, it suddenly stops. 'It was pretty scary that I'd had it all that time without realising. The doctors said if it hadn't been picked up, within five years I'd have had cirrhosis of the liver.' 'About 30 per cent of people with hepatitis C already have cirrhosis by the time they are diagnosed.' Hospital admissions for hepatitis C-related end stage liver disease and liver cancer in England have increased from 574 in 1998 to 2,266 in 2012. 'The trouble is the earliest symptoms will be feeling unwell and tired,' says Charles Gore, chief executive of the Hepatitis C Trust. 'And these people may think, “I'm 50, it's normal.” ' Professor Foster says this group could also have unwittingly passed it on to their children and grandchildren - around one in 20 mothers with hepatitis C will infect their baby. Luckily, Melanie's daughter was not affected. Experts say the rise in diagnoses may also be partly due to new infections. Last month, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence warned that diseases such as hepatitis C were becoming a growing problem among people injecting tanning drugs, dermal fillers such as Botox, and steroids. Another concern is home tattoo kits which could cause problems if needles are shared. 'I do have particular concerns about people going abroad to have cheap dental treatment,' adds Professor Foster. 'Romania, for example, has a huge problem with hepatitis C, and Egypt too.' The cause: Melanie, pictured with her daughter, contracted Hepatitis after receiving a blood transfusion when giving birth. This was before doctors started screening blood used in transfusions . Melanie's treatment involved a weekly injection of the drug interferon, which stimulates the immune system to fight the virus, and a daily tablet of ribavarin, which stops the virus spreading. Six months of treatment worked for Melanie, who is now clear of hepatitis C, but the side-effects, including nausea, insomnia, flu-like symptoms and poor concentration, can be debilitating. 'The only thing I could keep down was soup,' says Melanie. 'They had to stop the treatment in the fifth month because I was too ill - I'd lost two stone.' Treatments for hepatitis C cure 75 to 80 per cent of patients, but new options, including tablets that will replace interferon injections, are on the way with improved success rates and fewer side-effects. Undoubtedly, the sooner a patient is diagnosed, the better their chances of recovery. 'If it weren't for the fact I had it picked up after my surgery, I'd still be walking round with hepatitis C, oblivious,' says Melanie. 'If there's any chance you could have it, go and get tested.' hepctrust.org.uk .","Hepatitis C is contracted by blood to blood contact .

"Organisers of the 2015 Rugby World Cup put out a photograph yesterday purporting to show the ‘world’s biggest scrum’. Pah! It looked a tame affair compared to what we had in an Edinburgh shopping centre early teatime. Ooof, crrrump, thwock, splatt went a surging, throbbing meteorite of humanity. Somewhere in its core was Ed Miliband, leader of the Labour party, grinning so goofily it looked as if someone had stuck an ironing board in his mouth. Scroll down for video . Mobbed: Ed Miliband was caught up in the centre of a barging, shouting group of campaigners yesterday . Welcome to modern electioneering, complete with the bouquet of acidity that has characterised this Scottish referendum. Mr Miliband sneaked in by a back door. Cue a stampede of people who had been waiting by the shopping centre’s main entrance. By the time they reached Mr Miliband, he was at Ruby Reds Nails and Beauty Bar, where a zoned-out Yes voter was shouting through a megaphone ‘do what Ed says – he is your imperial master’. A melee formed and soon acquired an energy field all of its own. It contained perhaps 150 steaming bodies, many of them shouting, barging, struggling to keep their balance. The group would move 20 yards, then stop, then set off again at an angle. The TV cameramen had to walk in reverse. At least one toddler’s pushchair was flattened. The scrum contained No-vote supporters, Yes-vote protesters, a blinking American, political aides, and a few shoppers who had only been trying to get to jewellers H Samuel. Plus: HM Leader of the Opposition. A woman entrusted with the task of holding a ‘No’ poster just behind Ed’s head was on the short side. She kept jumping on her tiptoes. Limbs flew, leaflets fluttered. The background noise was of squawked complaint and minor flesh wounds. Scrum: Mr Miliband was grinning goofily at the centre of the mob, writes Quentin Letts . While having an elbow jammed up my left nostril and a stranger step on my ankle, I copped a clear view of Ed Mil’s eyes. They were two liquorice gobstoppers, rotating slowly in different directions. ‘You’re a f****** liar, Miliband!’ screamed a Yes-vote larrikin. ‘Call yerself a socialist?’ offered another sceptic. ‘Shame on you, ****! You’re a scaremonger! Disgrace!’ No one could hear what Mr Miliband himself was saying, if anything. One of the ladies holding No-vote posters put a hand to her sore ears and sighed ‘Oh, do stop shouting’. Whereupon she was informed ‘You’re a liar as well!’ Hounded: Most of those around Mr Miliband had their right arms raised, to take snaps with their telephones . Mr Miliband is tall. Each time he set off, his tweezered, hairsprayed coxcomb led the way. Follow that fringe! Arc lights glowed, flashbulbs pinged, red balloons popped. ’Waaaaaa!’ went a child. Or was it Mr Miliband’s handsome young gofer James, whose composure has been unravelling by the day, poor love? Most of the people had their right arms raised, to take snaps with their telephones. An evil pong of B.O. was soon brewing. The Socialist Workers’ party, always so helpful, turned up. The melee nearly drove over a metal bench on which a faintly puzzled old gent was sitting. And then, just as quickly as it all started, the Mili-maul ended, with our hero vanishing down a car park lift and legging it round the street corner. Lunacy. Ferocious: Gordon Brown pictured making one of his booming speeches in Glasgow on Tuesday . Threats: In his speech, Mr Brown argued that if Scotland leaves the UK, ‘inequality will last until Doomsday’ In other developments, Gordon Brown made one of his booming speeches in Glasgow. It took half an hour for my hearing to recover. He made a ferocious denunciation of Alex Salmond’s ‘lies’ on the NHS and noted that Mr Salmond’s main supporters were ‘North Korea’s Jim Kong Yoo, and Rupert Murdoch’. He perhaps meant Kim Jong-Un, but heck, this was Clydebank, so Jim it duly became . Mr Brown argued that if Scotland leaves the UK, ‘inequality will last until Doomsday’ and the worst-affected will be the poor, for the economy will not prosper with the Union. He may well be right. But Labour has cried wolf on poverty for too long. It has told the Scots they were badly off when, in fact, they were being richly subsidised. If working-class voters refuse to believe Mr Brown, he and his Labour mates may have only themselves to blame.","Ed Miliband sneaked into an Edinburgh shopping centre by a back door .

"U.S. officials are investigating the possibility that Russian hackers were responsible for attacking unclassified White House computer systems this week, forcing tech teams to take several systems offline. The Obama administration has described the impact as an 'inconvenience,' as staffers temporarily lost access to some digital resources. But the thought of a stealth cyberattack by Russian President Vladimir Putin – or by his industrialist cronies – is sending shock waves through Washington. Putin is, by all accounts, furious at the United States for a regime of punishing economic sanctions designed to pressure him to disengage his military from armed conflict in Ukraine. The New York Times reports that FireEye, a Silicon Valley cybersecurity firm, found that Russian hackers were behind a series of cyberattacks striking governments in Georgia, Poland, Hungary, and Mexico, along with NATO and several Eastern European nations – and their militaries. Hackers attacking the White House? It makes sense, experts say, given the havoc they could cause if they ever seized control of government computers . The Russians also allegedly targeted the computers of journalists whose reporting focuses on issues that the Putin government considers top-of-mind. 'This is no smash-and-grab, financially motivated Russian cybercriminal,' FireEye threat intelligence manager Laura Galante told the Times. 'This is Russia using their network operations to achieve their key political goals.' White House officials have confirmed that the attack on their computer infrastructure didn't accomplish anything approaching digital vandalism. No data was destroyed and the intruders were more akin to peeping Toms than to arsonists. 'The activity of concern is not being used to enable a destructive attack,' National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan told the Times. The administration won't directly address the possibility that Russians are to blame. 'It would be unwise, I think for rather obvious reasons, for me to discuss from here what we have learned so far,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Wednesday during a briefing. 'So what I can tell you as a general matter, though, is something that will not be particularly surprising to you. There are many people around the world who would love to gain greater insight into the activities of the United States government by collecting information from the White House network.' Earnest also said the computer network at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is 'subject to daily cyberattacks, or at least efforts to infiltrate it.' 'We take these kinds of activities very seriously,' he added. Equally serious is the fact that a country described as a 'friendly ally' alerted the White House that its computers may be under attack. Surveillance detection in the U.S. government's computer systems apparently failed. It's not clear if the Obama administration's unwelcome computer guests took anything, or if the foreign-government tipster was alerted by the presence of American material suddenly appearance on computer servers that typically host illicit data. Hacker-in-chief, maybe: Russian President Vladimir Putin's government is suspected of being behind repeated efforts to infiltrate the Obama administration's computers . Another possibility is that hackers – like burglars casing a building, looking for security cameras, and casually trying to open doorknobs and windows – were trying to assess the White House's capacity to protect its computer systems. The intruders may haev been trying 'to test what the security culture is, or to get valuable information about the security posture at the White House,' said Armond Caglar, a cybersecurity expert at the TSC Advantage consultancy. This week's revelations aren't the first episode of organized, stealthy hackers from Russia targeting American interests. In 2014 U.S. cybersecurity firms spotted a digital espionage campaign that appeared to target more than 1,000 computers at oil and gas companies in the West. In addition to industrial secrets, experts believe the criminals were searching for a way to control the computers – and the physical systems they control – from thousands of miles away. They covered their tracks by encrypting their communication and disguising their location, but the Times reports that small bits of Russian-language code was found in streams of data they left behind, along with other telltale signs like timestamps that established when the attacks were launched – in this case, during regular working hours in Moscow.","White House acknowledges daily attempts to intrude on its computer networks .

"Have you ever wondered what might happen if you leave the tap running for too long at home? This astonishing frozen waterfall was created out of a building in Jilin city in Jilin province, north-east China, after seventh-floor resident Wen Hsu, 58, left the hot tap on all winter. He had lived for 35 years in the property scheduled for demolition to make way for a new shopping centre - and when developers managed to buy all the other flats, he was left as the only resident. As winter approached, Mr Hsu was worried that the uninsulated water pipes running up through the unused and unheated flats below him would freeze, leaving him without running water. Amazing: This spectacular frozen waterfall was created out of a building in Jilin city in Jilin, China, after the owner left the hot tap running . So in order to keep the temperature of the pipes above freezing he simply switched on the tap - and then diverted the warm water to flow down the side of the building. He said: ‘The water running into the pipe is from underground where it is above freezing and that is stopping the water pipes in my house from freezing. If that had happened I really would have had to move out. They want me to move. 'But what they were offering was not enough for me to get another place so I'm refusing to leave.

The engines would tilt 45 degrees meaning the plane could land on runways anywhere in the world. It was created by Spanish designer Oscar Vinals . Capacity: 755 passengers . Wingspan: 88m . Length: 77m . Decks: 3 . Classes: Tourist class with sky views, business class and first class . Other features: Self-healing wings, engines that tilt 45-degrees making it possible to take off on the spot, double fuselage and virtual reality windows. Every passenger would additionally have virtual reality windows to keep themselves entertained on long flights. The AWWA Sky Whale was created by . Spanish designer Oscar Viñals and is so big it was  described . by Dvice as looking 'more like something thought up for the . Transformers movie franchise than a legitimate aircraft'. The tilting engines would make it possible for the Sky Whale to take off on the spot - and, according to the plans, if it crashes the passenger section would separate from the wings to reduce the loss of life. The craft matches advances in technology with a huge capacity of 755 passengers, making it economically viable for an airline. The plane would seat 755 passengers, making it economically viable for an airline, such as Iberia, pictured in this concept illustration. Passengers would be divided into three classes: 'tourist class', the equivalent of economy, 'tourist class with sky views', or business class, and 'first class' The Sky Whale, pictured, would be built out of advanced new materials made up of ceramic or fibre composites. It would also have advanced 'active wings' powered by a hybrid turbo-electric propulsion system making them much more efficient than today . The Sky Whale would have a wingspan of 88m compared to 80m for an Airbus A380 and 64m for a Boeing 747. The three classes would be ‘tourist class’, the equivalent of economy, ‘tourist class with sky views’, or business class, and finally ‘first class’, which would also have sky views and ‘all conceivable luxuries’. It is not clear how passengers would be able to look at the view, though given the size of the craft it is likely to have larger windows than those fitted to the back of current plane seat ones. Those in economy would not be without, though - their windows would be fitted with virtual reality screens so passengers could see whatever they want. According to Vinals' concept plans, the giant aircraft would be powered by three Harrier-style jets and feature a double fuselage, meaning it could go longer without refuelling. There would also be micro solar cells on the wings that could draw power from the sun . The Sky Whale, pictured top, would have a wingspan of 88m compared to 80m for an Airbus A380, pictured bottom, and 64m for a Boeing 747, pictured in the centre . The Sky Whale would also be longer than current commercial aircraft at 77m. By comparison, the Airbus A380 is 67.9m long while the Boeing 747 is 76m long, pictured . Viñals, who is based in Barcelona, said the Sky Whale would be built out of advanced new materials made up of ceramic or fibre composites. It would have advanced 'active wings' powered by a hybrid turbo-electric propulsion system making   them much more efficient than today. The Sky Whale would have a double fuselage meaning it could go longer without refuelling and would have micro solar cells on the wings so that it could draw power from the sun. According to Viñals, the engines could tilt to up to 45 degrees meaning they could land on tiny runways anywhere in the world. They would be controlled by a fly-by wire system that is assisted with active sensors located through the plane’s surface. In addition to being able to land on small runways, the tilting engines would also make it possible for the plane to take off on the spot. These engines would be controlled by a fly-by wire system assisted with active sensors located through the plane's surface . If the Sky Whale has to make a crash landing, the passenger section would separate from the wings to reduce the loss of life. The effect of all the technology is to reduce drag, fuel consumption and weight, making it one of the greenest aircrafts imaginable . Writing about the way the plane could break up, Viñals said: ‘The disposition of the wings and its architecture separates from the airplane’s fuselage like a security measure, that in a hypothetical fatal case of an emergency landing, these could auto-break up to reduce the damages on the passengers section.' The effect of all the technology is to reduce drag, fuel consumption and weight, making it one of the greenest aircraft imaginable. In his proposal Viñals said the Sky Whale 'is a concept about the future ‘green’ aircraft designs for the regular airline’s planes of the 21st century… . ‘...Is a mixture between today’s airplanes and future concepts based in blended wing body or hybrid wing body architecture.’ Designer Vinals has not announced any plans to build the concept aircraft, pictured .

"A firsthand account of the Navy SEAL raid that killed Osama bin Laden contradicts previous accounts by administration officials, raising questions as to whether the terror mastermind presented a clear threat when SEALs first fired upon him. Bin Laden apparently was hit in the head when he looked out of his bedroom door into the top-floor hallway of his compound as SEALs rushed up a narrow stairwell in his direction, according to former Navy SEAL Matt Bissonnette, writing under the pseudonym Mark Owen in 'No Easy Day.' The book is to be published next week by Penguin Group (USA)’s Dutton imprint. Bissonnette says he was directly behind a 'point man' going up the stairs in the pitch black hallway. 'Less than five steps' from top of the stairs, he heard 'suppressed' gunfire: 'BOP. BOP.' The point man had seen a 'man peeking out of the door' on the right side of the hallway. Scroll down for video . Target: A member of Seal Team Six shot and killed Osama bin Laden during the elite squad's daring raid of his compound in Abbotabad, Pakistan . Commando: A photo purported to be of Matt Bissonnette was published by Business Insider on Thursday . The author writes that bin Laden ducked back into his bedroom and the SEALs followed, only to find the terrorist crumpled on the floor in a pool of blood with a hole visible on the right side of his head and two women wailing over his body. Bissonnette says the point man pulled the two women out of the way and shoved them into a corner and he and the other SEALs trained their guns’ laser sites on bin Laden’s still-twitching body, shooting him several times until he lay motionless. The SEALs later found two weapons stored by the doorway, untouched, the author said. Bin Laden as wearing a white t-shirt, loose-fitting tan pants and a tunic. In the account related by administration officials after the raid in Pakistan, the SEALs shot bin Laden only after he ducked back into the bedroom because they assumed he might be reaching for a weapon. Tension: The raid of bin Laden's Abottabad compound was watched by President Obama and his closest advisers in the Situation Room of the White House . Watching: In this undated image from video seized from bin Laden's compound, the Al-Qaeda chief watches a TV programme showing an image of President Obama . It took approximately 15 minutes to find -- and kill -- Osama bin Laden in his Abottabad compound. Involved in the mission in the early morning hours of May 2, 2011 were 79 commandos that arrived in off in military helicopters from Jalalabad, Afghanistan. The first helicopter foundered above Bin Laden’s compound and crash-landed in the outer courtyard. The other helicopter landed outside the house. The SEAL team forced their way into the compound by blowing the door with explosives. The commandos shot three men and a woman -- whom U.S. officials said had lunged at them -- as they went up floor-by floor. On the third level, three of the Navy SEALs saw bin Laden standing at the end of a hallway as they reached the top of the steps. Two women in the room took positions in front of the terror leader to protect him. One of the soldiers grabbed the women and shoved them away while one of the SEALs behind him fired at bin Laden. The al-Qaeda boss was shot once in the chest and once in the head. Code-word ‘Geronimo’ is sounded to White House Situation Room, a signal that their target is dead. The SEALs then photograph the body for identification. On their way out of the compound, the soldiers blow up the broken-down chopper. The teams fly back to Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. Bin Laden’s body was then flown to a waiting naval ship, that buried at sea. White House spokesman Tommy Vietor would not comment on the apparent contradiction late Tuesday. But he said in an email, 'As President Obama said on the night that justice was brought to Osama bin Laden, ""We give thanks for the men who carried out this operation, for they exemplify the professionalism, patriotism and unparalleled courage of those who serve our country.""' 'No Easy Day' was due out September 11, but Dutton announced the book would be available a week early, September 4, because of a surge of orders due to advance publicity that drove the book to the top of the Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble.com best-seller lists. The Associated Press purchased a copy of the book on Tuesday. The account is sure to again raise questions as to whether the raid was intended to capture or simply to kill bin Laden. Bissonette writes that during a pre-raid briefing, a lawyer from 'either' the White House or Defense Department told them that they were not on an assassination mission. According to Bissonnette, the lawyer said that if bin Laden was 'naked with his hands up,' they should not 'engage' him. If bin Laden did not pose a threat, they should 'detain him.' In another possibly uncomfortable revelation for U.S. officials who say bin Laden’s body was treated with dignity before being given a full Muslim burial at sea, the author reveals that in the cramped helicopter flight out of the compound, one of the SEALs called 'Walt' -- one of the pseudonyms the author used for his fellow SEALs -- was sitting on bin Laden’s chest as the body lay at the author’s feet in the middle of the cabin, for the short flight to a refueling stop inside Pakistan where a third helicopter was waiting. This is common practice, as troops sometimes must sit on their own war dead in packed helicopters. Space was cramped because one of the helicopters had crashed in the initial assault, leaving little space for the roughly two dozen commandos in the two aircraft that remained. When the commandos reached the third aircraft, bin Laden’s body was moved to it. Bissonnette writes disparagingly that none of the SEALs were fans of President Barack Obama and knew that his administration would take credit for ordering the May 2011 raid. One of the SEALs said after the mission that they had just gotten Obama re-elected by carrying out the raid. But he says they respected him as commander in chief and for giving the operation the go-ahead. Bissonnette writes less flatteringly of meeting Vice President Joe Biden along with Obama at the headquarters of the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment after the raid. He says Biden told 'lame jokes' no one understood, reminding him of 'someone’s drunken uncle at Christmas dinner.' Terror house: Bin Laden's compound has since been torn down . Mission: Bin Laden was killed during the 40-minute operation by the elite Navy SEAL Team Six in his Abbottabad, Pakistan, compound, seen here . Beyond such embarrassing observations, U.S. officials fear the book may include classified information, as it did not undergo the formal review required by the Pentagon for works published by former or current Defense Department employees. Officials from the Pentagon and the CIA, which commanded the mission, are examining the manuscript for possible disclosure of classified information and could take legal action against the author. In a statement provided to The Associated Press, the author says he did 'not disclose confidential or sensitive information that would compromise national security in any way.' Bissonnette’s real name was first revealed by Fox News and confirmed to The Associated Press. Jihadists on al-Qaida websites have posted purported photos of the author, calling for his murder.

"It may not look that spectacular, but fans of The Only Way is Essex are flocking from around the world to experience the Brentwood set of the hit TV series. Visitors are paying £22 each to see where the show is filmed - and £18 for children under 15 - more than the cost of a ride on the London Eye, a tour of the Tower of London, and not much cheaper than a studio tour of Harry Potter. Remarkably, tourists are travelling to Essex from as far afield as Australia in the hope of meeting stars of the ITV2 show, which is now coming into its seventh series. Fans of TV series The Only Way is Essex are travelling from around the world to see the set of the show. Pictured is popular nightclub The Sugar Hut in Brentwood .

"When a pole dancing society opened at a university, dozens of women signed up to get fit. But the club has now been  disbanded after Swansea University’s students’ union objected because of the pastime’s links  to the sex industry. In a statement, it said: ‘Activities such as pole fitness contributes to an atmosphere where women are viewed as sexual objects  and where violence against them is acceptable. ‘Evidence shows that young women aged 16 to 24 are the group who experience the most domestic and sexual violence. The Swansea Student Pole Fitness Society was initially allowed to become an official society of the union, but the decision was later revoked . 'This is the age of a large group of . our female students. This activity is inextricably linked to the . multi-million-pound sex industry and upholds and bolsters sexist . attitudes and behaviours.’ The Pole Fitness Society was due to hold twice-weekly sessions before the union intervened. Club . president Beth Morris said: ‘Lap dancing occurs in gentlemen’s clubs. Pole fitness is strictly for fitness. Since the classes are purely for . fitness, there is therefore no link between it and the sex industry.’ Heidi Muir, its treasurer, added: ‘There are union societies that encourage binge drinking and have done naked calendars. ‘But a fitness class which encourages a healthy lifestyle, body confidence and self-esteem doesn’t fit into these policies.’","Keep-fit classes were a big hit with the women at Swansea University .

"'Extreme speeches': Tariq Ramadan . David Cameron is facing embarrassment over the close links between a Government adviser on religion and an Islamist group placed under urgent investigation. The Prime Minister last week ordered the security services to look into the Muslim Brotherhood amid fears its leaders, exiled from Egypt, are plotting terrorist attacks from London. He said the inquiry would establish ‘the complete picture’ of the Brotherhood including its possible involvement with ‘violent extremism’ and its ‘presence here in the UK’. But the investigation is likely to lead to red faces in Whitehall, as a scion of the Muslim Brotherhood’s founding family is a senior ministerial adviser. Tariq Ramadan is one of 14 members of the Foreign Office’s Advisory Group on Freedom of Religion or Belief, chaired by Tory peer Baroness Warsi. He is Professor of Contemporary Islamic Studies at Oxford University, and was a member of a taskforce set up by Tony Blair after 7/7. But Prof Ramadan, 51, is grandson of the Muslim Brotherhood’s founder Hassan al-Banna and his father Said Ramadan was a leading light. The Swiss citizen was for several years banned from the US for ‘providing material support to a terrorist organisation’ and only let in after a long legal battle in which he argued that no link with terrorism existed. He was kept out of France in the 1990s over supposed links to Algerian terrorists. He lost two posts at Dutch universities for hosting a chat show on a TV channel backed by the Iranian regime and became notorious for refusing to say stoning to death should be banned outright, although calling for a moratorium. Prime Minister David Cameron last week ordered the security services to look into the Muslim Brotherhood amid fears its leaders, exiled from Egypt, are plotting terrorist attacks from London . Critics repeatedly accuse the smartly dressed, well-spoken scholar of seeming to be moderate when speaking to Western audiences but giving more extreme speeches in Arabic. Douglas Murray, associate director of the Henry Jackson Society think-tank, said: ‘David Cameron should be deeply embarrassed by this. Tariq Ramadan is extremely loyal to his father and grandfather and he does not, by any means, speak out against the Muslim Brotherhood.’ A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘Prof Ramadan has written and taught extensively on issues relating to Islam, and therefore has plenty of  relevant experience to bring to  the group.’Prof Ramadan’s office in France declined to comment.","PM facing embarrassment over links between adviser and Islamist group .

"With a manic glare and chilling cackle, Chucky terrified 1980s cinema-goers as he committed a series of horrific murders. But according to Emma Kivell, the four-foot-tall killer doll is 'just so cute'. Miss Kivell, 31, fell in love with the voodoo-obsessed character from the slasher franchise Child's Play when she saw the first film in 1988. Fan: Emma Kivell, 31, fell in love with the 'living dead doll' Chucky after watching Child's Play 1 in 1988 . Now, she has transformed her room into a shrine to the terrifying figure. Her pillow is a giant Chucky face, and her bed is lined with soft toy versions of Chucky. She also owns a nodding doll, a beanie doll, and the full DVD box set - which she has confessed to watching 'about 1,000 times'. On Halloween, Miss Kivell, an air hostess, has dressed up as her flame-haired idol. For her birthday, she had a custom-made cake fashioned to look like the character's face. Obsessed: She has dressed up as Chucky for Halloween and requested a Chucky cake for her birthday . She has confessed to watching each of the six Chucky films - spanning 35 years - thousands of times . Birthday: She requested a Chucky cake for her birthday - complete with a bloody message on his neck . Child's Play is a series of six slasher movies that follows a murderous four-foot-tall doll, Chucky. Once a killer called Charles Lee Ray, he is murdered in a toy shop and his soul is transferred into the body of a doll. A murderous rampage ensues. It is based on Robert The Doll, a toy belonging to US artist Robert Eugene Otto in the 1940s-70s, which was supposedly possessed. Chucky is voiced by character actor Brad Dourif, famed for his role as Billy Bibbit in One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, and later as Grima Wormtongue in Lord Of The Rings. Miss Kivell, from Stockport, said: 'I just love him, he is so funny and cute, watching the films you just wouldn’t expect a voice to come out of a doll.' 'I sleep with my soft doll and my chucky pillow of a night, which has freaked out boyfriends in the past. 'One actually wanted it out of the bed before he would sleep in it.' Child’s Play is about a voodoo-obsessed . serial killer called Charles Lee Ray, known as the Lakeshore Strangler, . who is killed by a police officer in a toy shop. But as he takes his dying breath, he swears revenge and transfers his soul into a Good Guy doll and begins his murderous rampage. The first installment was released in 1988 and the six film, Curse of Chucky, was released in 2013. But rather than the original, Miss Kivell's favourite film in the series is the 1998 edition Bride of Chucky, which saw the franchise take a more tongue-in-cheek tone. She said: 'Chucky becomes a funnier character and some of the one liners in the film are great. 'I like the films because there so much detail that goes into them and they’re classics.

"Russian hackers have stolen 1.2 billion user names and passwords in a series of Internet heists affecting 420,000 websites, according to a report published Tuesday. The thievery was uncovered by Hold Security, a Milwaukee firm that specializes in exposing security breaches. The identities of the websites that were broken into haven't been revealed yet. Concerns: Besides filching 1.2 billion online passwords, the hackers also have amassed 500 million email addresses that could help them engineer other crimes . The breaches were reported by The New York Times, which said nondisclosure agreements required Hold Security to keep some information confidential. The reported break-ins are the latest incidents to raise doubts about the security measures that both big and small companies use to protect people's information online. Security experts believe hackers will continue breaking into computer networks unless companies become more vigilant. 'Companies that rely on usernames and passwords have to develop a sense of urgency about changing this,' Avivah Litan, a security analyst at the research firm Gartner told the Times. Retailer Target Corp. is still struggling to win back its shoppers' trust after hackers believed to be attacking from Eastern Europe stole 40 million credit card numbers and 70 million addresses, phone numbers and other personal information last winter. Alex Holden, the founder and chief information security officer of Hold Security, told the Times that most of the sites hit by the Russian hackers are still vulnerable to further break-ins. Besides filching 1.2 billion online passwords, the hackers also have amassed 500 million email addresses that could help them engineer other crimes, according to Hold Security. So far little of the information stolen in the wave of attacks appears to have been sold to other online crooks, according to the Times. Instead, the information is being used to send marketing pitches, schemes and other junk messages on social networks on Twitter, the newspaper said. The breadth of these break-ins should serve as a chilling reminder of the skullduggery that has been going undetected on the Internet for years, said John Prisco, CEO of another security firm, Triumfant. 'This issue reminds me of an iceberg, where 90 percent of it is actually underwater,' Prisco said in an emailed statement. 'That's what is going on here... So many cyber breaches today are not actually reported, often times because companies are losing information and they are not even aware of it.' Candid Wueest, Principal Threat Researcher from Symantec Security Response, said that despite the huge volume of data stolen by the Russians, there's no cause for panic. He told MailOnline: 'There's no need to run around and panic. It's not the first or last data breach - just a very large one. Plus, there's still speculation about just how old this data is.' Mr Wueest explained that using robust passwords is the key to keeping personal details safe from intruders. He said: 'Use strong passwords, it's a no brainer. We've been teaching that for 10 to 20 years - and some people still use '12345' as a password. Having said that, it doesn't have to be really cryptic. For example, you could go for 'ireadthedailymailonceaday'. And make sure you use different passwords for every service, so that losing one password doesn't compromise too many accounts. It's fine to use the same one if it's not linked to something sensitive. 'If you can't remember your passwords, use an app like 'password manager'. This means you just need to remember one master password that unlocks all of them.' Gary Newe, Senior Systems Engineering Manager for F5 Networks, said: 'It is worth noting that these hackers, unless they are specifically interested in a specific company for espionage, will move onto a new target if their chosen one is too difficult to compromise. So in terms of protecting yourself, you only have to make your apps more difficult to compromise than your neighbours and you will be in a better position than you are today.' He added: 'As we have seen in the news, especially with the European Central Bank Hacking, these types of attacks and the market for this information is growing and is almost becoming legitimised in some circles.' The news follows claims by a Berlin-based hacker that he's found a way to infiltrate communication systems on planes through Wi-Fi and inflight entertainment systems. Ruben Santamarta, a consultant with cyber security firm IOActive, is scheduled to explain his method at this week's Black Hat hacking conference in Las Vegas. Exposing threats: Cybersecurity researcher Ruben Santamarta says he has figured out how to hack the satellite communications equipment on passenger jets through their WiFi and inflight entertainment systems . Details are still sketchy about how the plane hack was done. Mr Santamarta, however, has revealed that one vulnerability in equipment from all five manufacturers was the use of 'hardcoded' log-in credentials. These are designed to let service technicians access any piece of equipment with the same login and password. The problem is that hackers can retrieve those passwords by hacking into the firmware, then use the credentials to access sensitive systems, Mr Santamarta said. If his claim is confirmed, it could prompt a serious review of aircraft security. 'These devices are wide open. The goal of this talk is to help change that situation,' Mr Santamarta, 32, told Reuters. The researcher said he discovered the vulnerabilities by 'reverse engineering' - or decoding - highly specialised software known as firmware, used to operate communications equipment. This equipment is made by companies including Cobham Plc, Harris Corp, EchoStar Corp's Hughes Network Systems, Iridium Communications Inc and Japan Radio Co Ltd. In theory, a hacker could use a plane's onboard Wi-Fi signal or inflight entertainment system to hack into its avionics equipment, potentially disrupting or modifying satellite communications. This could interfere with the aircraft's navigation and safety systems, Mr Santamarta said.","The identities of the websites that were broken into haven't been identified .

"Russian hackers with links to Vladimir Putin's government were behind an enormous cyberattack on JP Morgan Chase this summer, security officials believe - and they could have targeted as many as nine other banks. The huge security breach, which went on for months and affected 83million accounts, took place last June and let hackers see the names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses of customers. Accounts belonging to 76million households - and a further 7million small businesses - were hit by the breach, which insiders have now said was even bigger than first feared. Scroll down for video . Data breach: The New York-based bank have filed a report to the Securities and Exchange Commission saying 76 million customers could have been hit by the latest breach . Sources who had been briefed on the attack told the New York Times's Dealbook column they believe the attacks came from Russia - and were a possible revenge for economic sanctions levied on the country. Others said it was a warning shot designed to show Wall St how vulnerable their systems are. They also revealed that JP Morgan Chase - the biggest U.S. bank - was not the only target, and that nine other financial institutions were also in the hackers' sights. Links: Sources briefed on the attack said the hackers could be associated with the Russian government of Vladimir Putin . It is not clear which companies were hit by the attack, or whether it was as severe as the one on JP Morgan. The main attack began in June, and continued undiscovered until late July. It then took the bank's security experts until August to boot the hackers out completely. No money was taken from anybody's account in the attack, and there has yet to be any evidence of fraud. The bank filed a report on the incident to the Securities Exchange Commission on Thursday revealing the true extent of the attack. As well as giving the intruders access to records, it also impacted internal data held by the New York-based bank relating to users. However the firm says there is no evidence that account information, such as account numbers, passwords or Social Security numbers, was stolen, meaning customers' money is safe.

"Hillary Clinton's legacy as secretary of state is thin, judging from a press conference Tuesday in which the State Department's chief spokeswoman couldn't articulate any of the future presidential candidate's achievements on the job. She's not alone, with experts of all political stripes finding it difficult to bolster Clinton's resume as America's top diplomat. The former secretary of state herself had trouble articulating any lasting achievements from her tenure, during an April 3 appearance at the Women of the World Summit in New York City. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . State Department press secretary Jen Psaki seemed blindsided by a reporter who asked her to name a Hillary Clinton achievement that stemmed from the agency's 2010 internal review . CNN?s afternoon panel erupted in laughter at Psaki's gaffe, saying the question shouldn't have come as a surprise . State Department Press Secretary Jen Psaki was flummoxed, too, when asked about a 2010 State Department Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) that summarized then-Secretary Clinton's goals and accomplishments. 'Can you, off the top of your head, identify one tangible achievement that ... resulted from the last QDDR?' asked an Associated Press reporter during the daily briefing. 'I am certain that those who were here at the time, who worked hard on that effort, could point out one,' Psaki replied through a forced smile. 'I’m sure there are a range of things that were put into place that I’m not even aware of,' she offered moments later. 'I won’t hold my breath,' the reporter shot back. Video of the exchange rocketed across the Internet and quickly found its way to network television, bringing guffaws from a CNN panel . 'Given Hillary Clinton’s obvious ambitions that we continually talk about, although she’s not giving us much to go off of, it should not have been a surprising question,' said Politico reporter Juana Summers, a guest appearing with chief national correspondent John King. The question stumped Clinton herself on April 3. 'When you look at your time as Secretary . of State, what are you most proud of?' the Women of the World Summit moderator asked. 'And what do you feel was . unfinished, and maybe have another crack at one day?' “Well, I really see – that was good – that’s why he wins prizes,' Clinton dissembled. Asked in April to name her own crowning achievement as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton talked only about the collaborative 'relay race' of setting policy . Searching for a Hillary Clinton fan: Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt thinks she was 'the most consequential secretary of state since Dean Acheson,' Harry S. Truman's legendary global emissary . Hillary Clinton will likely be back to kissing babies on the campaign trail as she prepares to run for president in 2016 -- but she suffers from an 'achievement gap' from her time as secretary of state . 'Look, I really see my role as secretary, in fact leadership in general . in a democracy, as a relay race. When you run the best race you can run, . you hand off the baton. Some of what hasn’t been finished may go on to . be finished, so when President Obama asked me to be Secretary of State I . agreed.' She ultimately took credit for vaguely 'setting the values, setting the standards' of American global leadership. Lanny Davis, the former Clinton White House counsel in Bill Clinton's administration, said Hillary has succeeded in becoming 'the most popular woman in the world' 'I just don’t want to lose that because we have a dysfunctional political situation in Washington. Then of course, a lot of particulars, but I am finishing my book so you’ll be able to read all about it.' Clinton may be left with an embarrassing bit of unfinished business to explain in 2016: a whopping $6 billion in State Department funds that went missing because of improper contracting procedures. Contract files worth $2.1 billion, according to an Inspector General report, 'could not be located at all.' 'The failure to maintain contract files adequately creates significant financial risk and demonstrates a lack of internal control over the Department’s contract actions,' the report added. Talking heads, including some Clinton partisans, have struggled to name any of her achievements at the helm of State. America Rising, a political action committee that is among the leaders of the pre-emptive anti-Hillary movement on the political right, assembled a list on Wednesday. 'You think Hillary has an ""accomplishment problem"" ahead of her book release?' the group jabbed. 'Yikes.' The top-ten list is ripe for GOP mocking. Lanny Davis, the White House counsel during the Bill Clinton administration, told radio host Hugh Hewitt on January 29 that the former first lady's chief accomplishment was encouraging 'goodwill around the world.' 'This is a secretary of state – is the most popular woman in the world, and restored relations with everyone,' said Davis. Politico searched in December for insiders who would echo Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt's claim that Clinton was 'the most consequential secretary of state since Dean Acheson' in the Harry S. Truman administration. But 'even many of her most ardent defenders recognize Hillary Clinton had no signal accomplishment at the State Department to her name,' the newspaper concluded, 'no indelible peace sealed with her handshake, no war averted, no nuclear crisis defused.' 'There are few Eric Schmidts out there still willing to make the case for her as an enormously consequential figure in the history of Foggy Bottom.' Politico tracked down David Gordon, who was in charge of State Department policy planning in the George W. Bush administration. He said Clinton's 'great weakness was avoiding serious diplomacy.' 'It is hard to avoid the conclusion that for Clinton, the SecState role was substantially about positioning her to run for president,' Gordon told the newspaper, 'especially in terms of looking ""tough"" on some of the big issues: Iran sanctions, reassuring Asian allies.' 'Not taking on the big diplomatic challenges made that toughness easier to maintain even as she devoted so much of her actual time in office to ""soft"" issues like education, women’s empowerment, etc.'","Jen Psaki, the State Department's chief spokesperson, seemed blindsided by a question about Clinton's accomplishments .

"CENTURIES OF CHANGE by Ian Mortimer (The Bodley Head £20) People can get by without laptops but not without buttons, introduced in the 1330s, which transformed the way people looked, from loose hanging garments to tight-fitting ones . This original and fascinating book sets out to discover which of the ten centuries from 1000 to 2000 saw the most change in the human condition. Surely, most of us would say, it can only be the 20th century? Flying, mass motoring, space travel, advanced weapons, atomic power, telephones, radio and television, computers and iPads — what more change do you want? Ah, says the historian Ian Mortimer, history is not just a matter of inventions. More important are changes in the conditions under which we live and, above all, in the ideas that are ruling at any one time. Many crucial inventions are ones we take for granted. People can get by without laptops but not without buttons, introduced in the 1330s, which transformed the way people looked, from loose hanging garments to tight-fitting ones. The moon landing was a giant step for mankind but it did not affect daily life as much as the invention of glass mirrors around 1500. For the first time they enabled you to see what you looked like. Think of the consequences. People could see themselves as individuals, not just units in a group. It led to a demand for painted portraits, self-portraits, autobiography and general self-consciousness. Think of how life indoors was transformed in the 1500s with the coming of efficient chimneys to take the smoke out and glass windows to let the light in (but not the cold). Or the coming of gas light in the streets in the 1820s and soon afterwards in the home with the boon of a gas cooker instead of the coal-fired range from 1834. Electric light bulbs (1870) led to all kind of electrically powered appliances — kettles, toasters, fans and sewing machines by the end of the 19th century. And the Great Exhibition of 1851 unveiled the flushing lavatory which soon led to dedicated bathrooms for the well-to-do. Public clocks on towers (from about 1400) became domestic in late 1600s — Charles II was very proud of his — but you had to wait till the 19th century to tell the time by your wrist watch. Columbus discovered the New World in 1492 but America’s existence made little difference to life for the average European except for the novelty of potatoes, tomatoes and tobacco. Most people would say the 20th century saw the most advancement with the rise of new technologies . Tea, coffee and chocolate did not appear till the 17th century, along with Dutch gin, French brandy, champagne and humble lemonade. Knowledge of the world was greatly expanded by the explorers of the 16th century, including Francis Drake the circumnavigator. But amazing new worlds were opened up by Galileo and Kepler, who invented the telescope and microscope from 1610. Even more mind-changing was not the discovery of what the surface of the moon actually looked like — which turned out to be bare and boring — but the photograph taken by an astronaut from moon orbit of the shining, blue and white Earth rising out of black space. Mortimer calls it ‘probably the most important photograph ever taken’. Nothing so vividly brought home to earthlings how small, how vulnerable and how exceptional among heavenly bodies our planet is. It is a planetary ride which Mortimer offers us in his tour of ten centuries. It is exhilarating to time-travel with him, free of the complexities of dynasties, wars and politics that normally clutter up history. The 11th century, for example, can be summarised as a century of building castles. After Hastings, William, Duke of Normandy, found conquering England a pushover — towns had no walled defences. He promptly built the Tower of London and his followers on their newly acquired lands followed suit. The 14th century was devastated by the Black Death. As it sped across Europe it turned into the most traumatic event in history up to that time — and perhaps ever since . The moon landing was a giant step for mankind but it did not affect daily life as much as the invention of glass mirrors around 1500 . The 14th century was devastated by the Black Death. As it sped across Europe it turned into the most traumatic event in history up to that time — and perhaps ever since. Sweeping over England in 1348-9, it killed 45 per cent of the population in seven months — to kill the equivalent number now you would have to drop two atom bombs (of Hiroshima size) every day for seven months. The plague was to recur in the 1360s and 70s and about every ten years for three more centuries. In 1563, it cost London 20 per cent of its population. Yet society did not collapse. One consequence was a general pay rise for labourers because they were now so scarce. The 18th-century Enlightenment elevated reason over superstition, putting paid to the savage persecution and hanging of so-called witches. Rousseau and Tom Paine persuaded men to think of themselves as free and equal, leading to American Independence and the French Revolution, both much aided by the new newspapers dispensing free speech and free thought. Mortimer debates whether people’s thinking was most changed by Darwin or by Karl Marx. He opts for Marx for introducing the dream of a classless, equal society — the kernel of socialism . The 19th century probably produced the most inventions that changed lives through the industrial and transport revolutions, using steam power. The population of England soared faster than anywhere else in Europe. People flocked to the cities looking for work. ‘Cities sucked the life out of rural England and the railways were the straws by which they did it,’ writes Mortimer memorably. Reform Bills increased the voting population but even after the third, in 1888, the electorate was only five million out of a population of 22 million. They were all men, of course. The serfdom of women began to be lifted when they were allowed to keep their own property when married. But men were still free to beat their wives or even to sell them at country fair auctions. Mortimer debates whether people’s thinking was most changed by Darwin or by Karl Marx. He opts for Marx for introducing the dream of a classless, equal society — the kernel of socialism. So which century brought the most change? That depends on the field of change that you reckon most important. The 16th and 19th century probably caused more radical change in ordinary people’s lives by increasing how much food, heat and shelter was available. As a result the population grew far more than in other centuries. But the 20th century brought the biggest increase in life expectancy and personal wealth (GDP per head), sexual equality and crime reduction. Does the rise of liberal democracy as the goal of most western societies mean that we have reached stability and the ‘end of history’? No, answers Mortimer, because our present prosperity is unsustainable. Endless growth is impossible. The Earth’s limited resources are being exhausted ever faster by ever-increasing numbers of humans. In a sombre last chapter on ‘Why it matters’, he predicts the future, beginning in this very century of declining civilisation as supplies of oil, gas, water and land begin to be exhausted.Unless we manage to reduce consumption to sustainable levels, the future will be one of anarchy —the war of the rich holding on to what they’ve got against the poor who will get ever poorer. The outlook, he says, is fearsome. Can we believe in human progress? If we do, it may not be for much longer.","People can get by without laptops but not  buttons, introduced in the 1330s .

"U.S. health officials are warning a widespread drug used to treat gonorrhea has been rendered ineffective, leaving only one drug option to defend against one of the most rampant sexually transmitted diseases in America. The bacteria that causes gonorrhea has become resistant to antibiotics used to treat the condition, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC's announcement echos concerns raised by the World Health Organization (WHO) earlier this summer, that sounded the alarm that a widespread treatment for the disease was not longer viable. Dwindling treatment options: Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the  bacteria that causes gonorrhea, has become resistant to antibiotics used to treat the condition, according to a new report from the CDC . Roughly 700,000 cases of gonorrhea occur in the U.S. annually, of the estimated 106 million people each year who are infected worldwide. In the U.S., it is most prevalent among African Americans and sexually active teenagers and young adults. Since 2007, the Atlanta-based agency has recommended cefixime, an oral medication under the brand name Suprax, as the first line of defense to combat the spread of the infection. But now the CDC believes cefixime is not adequately treating the condition and patients can no longer rely on it as a viable option. The CDC will review potential treatment alternatives but fear research and development for gonorrhea drugs will be a tough sell to pharmaceutical companies . With cefixime no longer being recommended, only one . treatment is left available to those suffering from the disease, . commonly referred to as 'The Clap.' Instead, patients with the condition are advised to receive an antibiotic delivered by injection, known as ceftriaxone. Gonorrhea . is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhea and spreads through . sexual activity, but has been known at times to spread from an untreated . mother to her baby during childbirth. The . sexually transmitted disease (STD) can grow easily in the warm, moist . areas of the reproductive tract, including the cervix, uterus, and . fallopian tubes in women, and in the urethra in both women and men. Those . infected, particularly women, can show no symptoms. Symptoms for men . include a burning sensation when urinating, or colored discharge. Complications . from the disease can include infertility and chronic pelvic pain in women and in men. In . most patients, a urine test can be used to test for gonorrhea. This change could become problematic because the shot is not typically stocked in a doctor's office and usually only found in STD clinics. Patients also tend to prefer pills to injections and might be less likely to seek the injectable option. With only one treatment deemed effective, health officials also fear the infection will eventually develop a resistance against ceftriaxone. 'Gonorrhea is becoming a major public health challenge, due to the high incidence of infections accompanied by dwindling treatment options,' Dr Manjula Lusti-Narasimhan, from the Department of Reproductive Health and Research at WHO, said in a statement in June. 'The available data only shows the tip of the iceberg. Without adequate surveillance we won't know the extent of resistance to gonorrhea and without research into new antimicrobial agents, there could soon be no effective treatment for patients.' The CDC and National Institutes of Health will review potential treatment alternatives but fear research and development for gonorrhea drugs will be a tough sell to pharmaceutical companies.","An estimated 700,000 cases of gonorrhea occur in the U.S. annually, of 106 million people each year who are infected worldwide ."
"Gruesome CCTV footage has surfaced of a New Zealand man with what appears to be a large rod lodged in his head making a plea for help inside a service station. The 23-year-old man is believed to have been attacked while sitting in his car late on Friday night in Katikati, south-east of Auckland. The scene inside Katikati Caltex store was so shocking that the owner, Lester Gray, suspected it was a prank, reports 3 News. Gory CCTV footage has surfaced of a New Zealand man with  a large rod lodged in his head . Store owner Lester Gray said he was in a state of disbelief. 'I was like, 'Man is this a TV show? Is this guy for real?' he said. 'It looked like a Halloween stunt where people where those Halloween costumes over their head. But it was pretty real when he turned around and blood was coming down the side of his head.' Police say the 23-year-old was attacked while sitting in his parked car in a suburban street. He was punched in the head then struck with the rod. Incredibly, not only was he was able to drive about four blocks to the petrol station, he arrived in a composed state.

"White supremacists are gathering today in Leith, North Dakota, the tiny town that a neo-Nazi leader hopes to turn into a white-only haven for racism. But Leith's only black resident is defiant and say's he's staying put. The other residents of the dwindling town of 24 people are planning a counter-protest to oppose the meeting of white supremacists. Leaders from across the state are joining forces in an effort to show the hate groups that they aren't welcome. 'We are deeply disturbed that one of the residents of our small community has invited hate groups to our town and to the state of North Dakota. One of these hate groups, the National Socialist Movement, is planning to hold a meeting in our city hall on Sunday afternoon, and raise neo Nazi flags on property around our town,' the town of Leith said in a statement. Defiant: Bobby Harper, the only black resident of Leith, North Dakota, says he isn't leaving - even though white supremacists are moving into his tiny town. He is pictured here with his wife, Sherrill . Supremacist's paradise: Craig Cobb, 61, has invited dozens of neo-Nazi leaders to Leith to start to haven for racist hate groups . 'The values of our town include safety and acceptance for everyone. We stand firmly against the bigoted views of this group, and will not be participating in their events.' Craig Cobb, a self-described white supremacist, had already bought several homes and properties in Leith when he moved to the town 75 miles southwest of Bismark last year. He had bought at least a dozen properties and given several of them to leaders of major neo-Nazi hate groups. Often, he paid just hundreds or a few thousand dollars absentee owners who had long ago fled Leith and left their properties in disrepair. He has grand visions for the town and is determined to revitalize it. He told National Public Radio: 'It would be extraordinarily beautiful when people enter the town, particularly at night because we will have floodlit flags from both the bottom and the top of all the formerly white nations of the earth. 'We will probably have the National Socialist hunting flag with stag horns and a very small swastika in the center, very discreet.' Ramshackle: Leith has just 24 residents. It has been in a slow decline for decades. Cobb bought most of the properties for just hundreds or a few thousand dollars . He plans parks and monuments and a municipal swimming pool, all named after white-power activists. But the Cobb and his white supremacist ilk have one immediate obstacle to their all-white paradise in Leith: Bobby Harper, the town's only black resident. 'I'm not leaving,' Harper told NPR. 'They gotta do something very, very drastic to me to make it unsafe and uncomfortable for me. Right now, I don't see it happening.' The U.S. National Socialist Movement, America's largest white  supremacist group, is joining forces with Cobb and is calling its members to Leith for a meeting on Sunday and Monday. 'We have every intention of legally assuming control of the local government,' Socialist Movement leader Jeff Schoep said in a statement. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, Cobb wants to set up a 'Pioneer Little Europe.' In an interview with WXMB-TV in Bismarck, Cobb said he had gotten a lot of offers to buy up land from what he termed like-minded people who believe white people should not be punished for wanting to live near each other. Video source KXNET.COM . Cobb moved to Leith from Montana and has purchased about a dozen homes and vacant parcels of land . 'It's fine for all these other minorities, but not us,' he said in the televised interview. 'If you merely speak about it, you're going to be defamed in this country.' Schoep said that the visitors would inspect the new property, raise ceremonial flag poles, and hold a town meeting and a news conference. 'We know that opinion is divided in the town and in the media,' Schoep said in the statement, adding that the trip was 'a symbolic gesture of good will and faith.' Schoep will be met by a grassroots group organized through social media to protest the National Socialists' presence in the time. Organizers are hoping several hundred will attend. 'We are planning a true grassroots peaceful protest to demonstrate that we are united in a stance against hatred, violence and prejudice,' reads a statement by UnityND, an anti-racism group organizing the protest, on its website. 'Join us as we take to main street rural America to fight against racism.' Sheriff Bay said does not expect any trouble to break out among the 350 people expected at the event and protest, but he is prepared. He has his officers, members of the North Dakota Highway Patrol and others coming to Leith on Sunday to help in crowd control. 'Both sides say they plan on having their demonstrations,' Bay said. 'They have both indicated to me that they will be peaceful demonstrations. They may be a little loud, but peaceful.'","U.S. National Socialist Movement, the largest neo-Nazi group in America, is planning Sunday rally in Leith, North Dakota .

"Nasa is backing plans to potentially put astronauts in a deep sleep during manned missions to Mars. The proposal would see a crew ‘hibernate’ for up to 180 days, allowing them to make the journey of 350 million miles (560 million km) with a reduced need for food and water. The crew would be kept alive through intravenous feeding, before being woken at their destination by inhalation of a coolant gas. Scroll down for video . A scientist at the International Astronomical Congress in Toronto has said a 'therapeutic torpor' could make a manned mission to Mars more feasible. Putting a crew into deep sleep means they would need less food and water. Shown here is what the stasis system might look like. An 'arm' helps care for the astronauts . Dr Mark Schaffer from SpaceWorks Enterprises in Atlanta suggested the proposal at the International Astronomical Congress in Toronto last week. He explained how astronauts could be put in ‘therapeutic torpor’ - a state of reduced physiological activity - to reduce their needs for the 90- to 180-day mission to Mars. Electrical impulses would stimulate the muscles of the astronauts while hibernating, ensuring that when they woke from their slumber they were not significantly weakened. To put astronauts in stasis, a system called RhinoChill would be used, which reduces body temperature by about one degree per hour by supplying coolant through the nose. At a temperature of between 32°C (89°F and 93°F), which takes six hours to reach, the crew would enter stasis. Stopping the flow of coolant would then wake the crew when they arrive at their destination. This means that on the journey to Mars, they could be placed in a fairly small capsule. Therapeutic torpor has been around, in theory, since the 1980s and since 2003 it has been a staple for critical care trauma patients in hospitals. It is not typically used for longer than a week. This would mean that, en route, the crew could be crammed into a smaller area with less cargo, meaning the spacecraft would not have to be as big as those referenced in other proposals. ‘Therapeutic torpor has been around, in theory, since the 1980s and really since 2003 it has been a staple for critical care trauma patients in hospitals,’ said Dr Schaffer, reports Discovery News. He added: ‘We haven’t had the need to keep someone in [therapeutic torpor] for longer than seven days. ‘For human Mars missions, we need to push that to 90 days, 180 days. 'Those are the types of mission flight times we’re talking about.’ Torpor reduces the metabolic needs for a human, essentially placing them in 'hibernation'. To put them in stasis, a system called RhinoChill would be used, which reduces body temperature by about one degree per hour by supplying coolant through the nose. Dr Schaffer says  the RhinoChill system, shown here, could put astronauts into a deep sleep. It is currently used to keep patients stable who have gone into cardiac arrest. It involves pumping coolant into their nose to lower their body temperature, decreasing their bodily functions until proper treatment can arrive . Some proposals suggest the habitat could also spin, providing artificial gravity and reducing bone and muscle loss for the astronauts. In this case the habitat might be a cylinder, shown, with the astronauts on one side to experience the force of gravity . Putting a crew in hibernation means the spacecraft designed to take them there could be smaller (illustration shown), cutting weight requirements from 400 tons to 220 tons. The crew would be put to sleep for the 180-day journey to Mars by lowering their body temperature through their nose . Getting to Mars is difficult due to the vast distances involved. The distance varies dramatically depending on where Earth and Mars are in their orbits. At their closest they are as little as 36 million miles (58 million km) apart, but at their furthest they can be 250 million miles (400 million km). The way to get to Mars using the minimum energy involves launching in a specific window when the two planets are aligned in such a way that a craft can catch up to the red planet when launched from Earth and enter orbit. This launch window opens approximately every two years and two months, which is why mission to Mars often launch and arrive at similar times – such as India’s recent Mars orbiter and Nasa’s Maven mission. The next window opens in April 2018, when Nasa’s next Mars mission – Insight – will launch towards the red planet, while the as-yet unnamed Mars 2020 rover will do the same when the next window opens in July 2020. At a temperature of between 32°C (89°F and 93°F), which takes six hours to reach, the crew would enter stasis. Stopping the flow of coolant would then wake the crew when they arrive at their destination. This means that on the journey to Mars, they could be placed in a fairly small capsule. In fact, the study by SpaceWorks suggests it could be five times smaller than a comparable spacecraft in which the astronauts weren't in stasis. And they would need three times less cargo including food and water to survive. In total, this could cut the weight requirements of such a mission from 400 tons to about 220 tons. Upon arriving they would perform the key science of their mission, before being put in stasis again for the journey home. Some proposals suggest the habitat could also spin, providing artificial gravity and reducing bone and muscle loss for the astronauts. An alternative would be to have the crew on hibernation ‘shifts’, with one person staying awake for two or three days before hibernating for 14 days. More research is needed before the proposal is accepted as a viable option by Nasa. In the future, it a crew would go to sleep in Earth orbit - and wake up 180 days later in orbit around the red planet. The crew will likely be taken to and from a future ship to Mars aboard the Orion spacecraft (illustrated). In December this year Orion will complete its first unmanned test flight. Nasa intends to use it to take humans to an asteroid in the 2020s and to Mars in the 2030s . During interplanetary transit, the crew would receive low-level electrical impulses (illustrated) to key muscle groups to prevent muscles wasting away while in hibernation. An optimal crew size for a mission to Mars may be six people, as seen here, with the future Orion spacecraft likely able to carry a crew of this size . Once they had performed their scientific objects, potentially on the surface (illustration shown), they would be put to sleep again for the return home. The study was backed by Nasa but the agency has not yet decided if it will use such a technique on future manned missions to Mars or not .","Expert claims 'therapeutic torpor' could make mission to Mars more feasible .

"A traffic warden is fighting for his life in hospital after claims he was savagely beaten by a driver because he gave the man a parking ticket. The warden, who is in his 40s, is understood to have been hit over the head with a piece of wood in Bounds Green, north London, just before 4.45 yesterday afternoon. Police say they arrested a 29-year-old man on suspicion of GBH half an hour after the attack, while the victim remains in a 'serious but stable' condition. Scroll down for video . A traffic warden, who is in his 40s, was rushed to hospital after apparently being beaten unconscious with a wooden plank in Bounds Green, London, yesterday in a row over a ticket (file picture) Onlookers described a 'running battle' along busy Myddelton Road as both men hit out at each other before the parking warden collapsed. An anonymous source who spoke to the Evening Standard said: 'I broke them up but the warden continued to fight as well. At one point the warden picked up the man and threw him. 'At another stage the warden was on the ground and the man was repeatedly punching him in the face. It was really sickening. He is lucky to be alive.' Meanwhile another witness, Afroulla Yiannopoulou, 48, told the paper that a first aider and a passing nurse stopped to help before an ambulance arrived. A London Ambulance Service spokeswoman said the traffic warden was taken as a priority to hospital with a head injury, while a second man was also injured. The attack happened on Myddleton Road, in Bounds Green (pictured) and witnesses describe a 'running battle' up the street, with both men hitting out at each other . A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'Police were called to Myddleton Road, Bounds Green, shortly before 4.45pm on Tuesday to reports of an assault. 'Officers and London Ambulance Service attended and found two injured males. 'One, a traffic warden, had suffered a serious head injury after being struck with a blunt object. He has been taken to an east London hospital where his condition is serious but stable. 'A second male sustained a non-life-threatening eye injury and was taken to a central London hospital for treatment. 'Around an hour after the incident a 29-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of GBH and taken into custody at a north London police station. Officers from Haringey are investigating.'","Traffic warden, in his 40s, taken to hospital in 'serious but stable' condition .

"The Pennsylvania state Supreme Court has suspended Justice Seamus McCaffery on full pay while he is investigated over claims that he exchanged 'hundreds' of pornographic emails with the state's Attorney General's Office. McCaffrey is also facing claims that he authorised the payment of cash to his wife from personal injury law firms for referring them potential clients. Four of the members of Pennsylvania's Supreme Court voted to suspend McCaffrey, one dissented while two others - including McCaffrey - recused themselves. He has been suspended on full pay while the investigation continues. Pennsylvania Supreme Court Justice Seamus McCaffrey, pictured, is accused of sending or receiving 234 pornographic or sexually explicit emails between late 2008 and 2012 as well as other misconduct . Justice McCaffrey, top left, has described the investigation as 'a vindictive pattern of attacks' by Chief Justice Ronald Castille, bottom centre, who branded his colleague as 'sociopathic' and the 'focus of ethical lapses' Chief Justice Ronald Castille described McCaffrey's attempts to blame others for his behaviour as bordering  on the 'sociopathic'. In his written opinion, Castille wrote: 'No other justice has failed to live up to the high ethical demands required of a justice of this court or has been the constant focus of ethical lapses to the degree of Justice McCaffery.' McCaffrey was not available for comment immediately after his suspension, although he had previously apologised for sending the emails which have been described as  'sexually explicit'. Earlier McCaffrey described the investigation as a 'cooked-up controversy' and part of 'a vindictive pattern of attacks' by Chief Justice Castille. A review of McCaffrey's computer showed he had sent or received 234 emails containing either sexually explicit material or pornography. Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane launched the investigation after pornographic emails were discovered in emails belonging to staff in her office from the time of her predecessor Tom Corbett . He wrote: 'I want to reiterate my apology for my lapse in judgment with respect to the offensive emails, personal emails that were made public by the outgoing chief justice,' McCaffery concluded. 'It was wrong, and I am sorry.' The 64-year-old Judge was elected to the high court seven years ago and earlier served as a Philadelphia police officer and the US Marine Corps. He said: 'Coarse language and crude jokes' were part of his life as a police office and as a Marine. 'That's not an excuse, just a fact,' McCaffery wrote. Four former employees of the attorney general's office have left government jobs in recent weeks following an investigation by new Attorney General Kathleen Kane. The emails were sent between late 2008 and early 2012 when Governor Tom Corbett was the state's attorney general. He denies any knowledge of the emails. Corbett's environmental protection secretary, Chris Abruzzo, and a lawyer in the department, Glenn Parno, both resigned after they were named as email participants. Rick Sheetz, who led the criminal division of the attorney general's office under Corbett, has resigned as a deputy prosecutor in Lancaster County, and Randy Feathers, who supervised investigators in the Jerry Sandusky molestation case, has announced he will soon retire from his appointed position on the state Board of Probation and Parole. Former Attorney General Tom Corbett, pictured, who is now governor of Pennsylvania denies all knowledge of the pornographic messages allegedly sent between his staff and Justice McCaffrey between 2008 and 2012 . The suspension, with pay, will last until the state Judicial Conduct Board decides whether to bring formal charges against McCaffery under an expedited review process expected to take 30 days. He was elected as a Democrat to the Supreme Court in 2007. Possible further disciplinary action could include removal from the bench and loss of his license to practice law. The main issue cited by the court in its decision was that McCaffery exchanged 'hundreds' of pornographic emails with lawyers in the Pennsylvania attorney general's office during the years that Tom Corbett, now the governor, was attorney general. Corbett himself has not been linked to the porn emails and in recent weeks has forced several former lawyers from the attorney general's office who were implicated in the scandal to resign their current state jobs. The porn emails, which the court called 'highly disturbing,' came to light during an investigation by the current attorney general, Kathleen Kane, into how Corbett handled the child sex abuse allegations against Jerry Sandusky, the former assistant football coach of Pennsylvania State University. Also mentioned in the court's opinion was an allegation, first reported last year by the Philadelphia Inquirer, that McCaffery authorized hundreds of thousands of dollars in referral payments by personal injury law firms to his wife and chief aide, Lise Rapaport, for sending them clients. The court also cited an alleged action by McCaffery to have the Philadelphia Traffic Court fix a ticket his wife received, as well as allegedly improper attempts by the justice to influence assignment of judges in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas. McCaffery denies any wrongdoing in both these cases.","Judge Seamus McCaffrey sent or received 234 explicit email messages .

"The stepfather of a woman held by police for three days over the shooting of two burglars said last night: 'I'd have blown their bloody heads off.' John Towell said Tracey Ferrie and her husband Andy who was also arrested had faced a gang of four men at their isolated cottage in the early hours. He said: 'Four of them came in. Andy and Tracey did what anyone would have done.' He said the law must now be changed to protect property owners who act to defend their land when it is burgled. 'Shoot their legs? I'd have blown their bloody heads off,' he declared. It comes as one of the group, Daniel Mansell, 33, from Leicester, pleaded guilty at Loughborough Magistrates' Court today  to the burglary at the farmhouse in the early hours on Sunday. Held in isolation: 'Hard-working' Andy and Tracey Ferrie, from Leicestershire, were held by police for three days over the shooting of two burglars . He was remanded in custody and will be sentenced at Leicester Crown Court on September 25. Joshua O'Gorman, 27, who is also charged with burglary, gave no indication of plea and was remanded in custody to appear before magistrates on September 14. Mr and Mrs Ferrie were arrested after dialling 999 to tell police they had shot at a gang trying to break in to their 200-year-old cottage near Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire. Mr Ferrie, 35, told police he grabbed the gun and fired it, hitting two of the men and forcing the others to flee. Four men were arrested at Leicester Royal Infirmary on suspicion of aggravated burglary. Last night police said Mr and Mrs Ferrie had been released on bail 'pending further inquiries'. But supporters of the ‘hard- working’ couple told of their outrage at their arrest on suspicion of causing grievous  bodily harm. Mr Ferrie's aunt Kathleen Merry said her nephew, who runs a caravan repair business, would have acted to protect his home and wife. Mrs Merry, from Leicester, said: 'What was Andy supposed to have done, wait to see if the men attacked him or Tracey, or worse?' It is thought Mrs Ferrie, 43, a country sports enthusiast and former model, held the licence for the shotgun used to fire at the alleged intruders. Analysis: Leicestershire Police cordoned off the stone cottage, which had reportedly been burgled several times already . Taking notes: Police were first called to the property shortly after midnight on September 2, by homeowner Mr Ferrie . Last night her mother Hazel, 63, who is married to Mr Towell, said her daughter was a keen clay pigeon shooter and confirmed she owned a gun. Mrs Towell said her daughter called from the police station, where she was  being held in isolation from her husband, on Monday. She said: 'I was so relieved to talk . to her. She phoned, saying: ''Don't worry about me''. They've had . break-ins before over there. It's remote. It must have been planned.' Mr and Mrs Ferrie's MP, Tory Alan . Duncan, has spoken out in their support and described them as 'victims' who should be free to defend their property. A Facebook group set up to support them had attracted more than 3,200 supporters by yesterday evening. Kathleen Merry said that even if the . couple were ultimately released without charge, their arrests could . impact on their plans to emigrate to Australia next year. 'Andy's life . could be ruined because a gang tried to burgle him,' she said. 'It's all . wrong.' Mr Ferrie, a keen musician, sang as . half of a guitar duo called Useless Wooden Toys who were at one time a . regular on the pub circuit in and around his home town of Melton . Mowbray. A friend of the couple said they met in a village pub when Mrs . Ferrie turned up to watch him perform. Police examine a shotgun after attending reports of a shooting at the 200-year-old property . At the time she was estranged from her first husband. The Ferries married two years ago after a short courtship. A friend of the Ferries, who asked not . to be named, recalled how the couple 'ran away to a register office' to . tie the knot without telling their friends. She added: 'They are a hard-working . but private couple who do not deserve what has happened to them. Andy . isn't a violent person – he doesn't like guns or killing animals and . isn't into country sports, although Tracey grew up in the country and is . a keen shooter.' Mr and Mrs Ferrie were held after suspected burglars were shot at their home . Police stand at the front door of the property as they attend the scene of the shooting at Melton Mowbray .

They were remanded in custody to appear at Loughborough . magistrates' court today. Two other men, aged 31 and 33, arrested on . suspicion of aggravated burglary, have been bailed pending further . inquiries. The case has reignited the debate . about the rights of householders to defend themselves and their homes . from intruders and comes as the Government prepares to introduce . legislation this autumn to clarify the law on the issue. The debate . first rose to prominence in 1999 when Norfolk farmer Tony Martin shot . dead 16-year-old Fred Barras at his remote home. Barras and accomplice Brendon Fearon . had disturbed Martin in the middle of the night. The farmer was jailed . for life at Norwich Crown Court in April 2000 for murder, but his . sentence was reduced by the Appeal Court to five years for manslaughter . and he was released in 2003. Fearon, who was wounded in the leg, was jailed for three years for conspiracy to burgle. * A Second World War veteran was being hailed a hero in America yesterday after he shot dead a burglar who broke into his home with two other men. Earl Jones, 92, wasn't arrested and is unlikely to be charged in Kentucky after shooting the raider dead with a single rifle bullet to the heart. 'These people aren't worth any more to me than a groundhog,' the pensioner said after the shooting in the early hours of Monday. Mr Jones claimed he was perfectly within his rights to defend his life and his home on a 500-acre farm. Kentucky, like at least 24 other states in the US, has a 'castle' doctrine enshrined in its laws which gives residents the right to protect their homes with deadly force if necessary to prevent criminal trespass, robbery or burglary.

"Heroin overdose deaths across the country are spiking as a deadly new variant of the drug mixed with a powerful painkiller is spreading from New Hampshire to Washington State. The lethal combination of heroin and fentanyl, an opiate used to soothe the pain of cancer patients, is blamed for about 100 deaths from coast to coast. It is variously labelled as ‘bud ice,’ ‘income tax’ and ‘theraflu,’ authorities say. The hardest hit states in the epidemic are Maryland, with more than three dozen deaths since September, and Pennsylvania, with almost two dozen this month alone, according to reports. Deadly: Investigators found 49 empty bags stamped with 'Ace of Spades' and 'Ace of Hearts' inside the actor's Manhattan apartment, according to officials. They usually contain a lethal mix of heroin and fentanyl - also known as 'Bud Ice' (above) Risk: The lethal concoction - also referred to as 'Theraflu' - has been linked to more than 100 deaths in the US . The killer drug cocktail first gained national notoriety last week when Pittsburgh-area officials said it had killed 22 people since only January 16, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane is so concerned about the deaths she announced a task force comprised of state, county and local police departments dedicated solely to eradicating it from Western Pennsylvania. Though Pennsylvania’s cases have so far . been the highest profile, Maryland’s medical examiner says 37 people in . the state have died in the last five months from injecting the poisonous . potion, CBS DC reported. The deaths were spread throughout the whole state, with 10 occurring in drug-ravaged Baltimore. A further 22 people died of heroin-fentanyl overdoses in Rhode Island during the first two weeks of this year, officials told the Providence Journal. 'People believe that they’re shooting heroin but the substance does not look like heroin and they’re shooting it and they’re dying,' a rehabilitation expert told the paper. Police in Portsmouth, NH, responded . to three overdoses in a single 24-hour period one day last week alone, . one of those people died, an official told Portsmouth Patch. Authorities in Nassau County, a Long Island suburb of New York, say the deadly dope has recently killed at least five people, Newsday reported. Other deaths linked to fentanyl-laced heroin have also been reported in Louisiana and Washington State. People are overdosing because the combination of fentanyl and heroin is recent trend, and results in a much more powerful high than users have seen before. Fentanyl is an opiate up to 100 times more powerful than morphine, Dr Karl Williams, the Allegheny County (PA) Medical Examiner told CBS News. The people who died from overdose were all discovered to have taken the lethal combination. ‘They found almost exactly the same substance in those stamped bags, a fifty – fifty mixture of heroin with Fentanyl,’ he said, adding the opiate provides a higher high than heroin by itself. Deadly: Fentanyl is up to 100 times more potent than morphine, and is being blamed for the rash of recent deaths . A Pittsburgh addict who declined to be identified told CBS News of his close brush with death after taking ‘bud ice.’ His dealer told him to ‘be careful,’ which he said is the first time he’d ever been warned. ‘I . go home, lock myself in my bathroom and I do [the drugs], and within 20 . seconds I was out,’ he recalled, saying his mother broke down the door . to revive him. Maryland’s chief medical examiner told CBS Baltimore the heroin variant kills people by shutting down their respiratory system. ‘Both substances slow down your breathing and can eventually slow it down to the point of death.'Officials in Louisiana, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Washington State have also blamed the drug for overdoses in their regions, according to CBS. Fentanyl-heroin combinations have reared their ugly heads in the past, most notably during the spring of 2006 in Chicago and Detroit – almost 300 people died from February to June while using the drug between the two cities, according to the Washington Post. Not like normal heroin: The killer heroin has a white color (pictured), far from the yellow tinted heroin most often found on the street . Authorities say that the easiest way to spot the more lethal heroin cocktail is because it is white. Heroin usually has a yellow tint to it. Even more scary, one expert told CBS News, is that dope slingers appear willing to let the drug kill some addicts because it will attract more business from junkies chasing a more potent high. ‘They're willing to lose four or five people to a drug overdose death to maybe attract 30 or 40 new customers and that's just the cost of doing business,’ said Dr. Neil Capretto of Gateway Rehab. First major bust: Tywon Newby is the first suspected dealer arrested for slinging the tainted dope . Sobering reality: The arrest of Tywon Newby (left) took a significant amount of the tainted dope of the streets, but also showed investigators dealers may have already started re-branding it to evade targeted enforcement . Pennsylvania authorities may have finally started making progress in their fight against the deadly blend. A slate of arrests has been announced over the past 24 hours of people charged with distribution. Tywon Newby, 39, of Clairton, was found with 2,000 bags of heroin, 48 more bricks of heroin, and more than $8,500 in cash, authorities said. Other arrests resulted in the seizure of thousands more bags of the lethal mixture, the Pittsburgh Tribune reported. The arrest of Mr Newby also brought forth a sobering discovery, he had begun labeling the heroin-fentanyl blend ‘sky high.’","The killer dope is a 50/50 blend of heroin and fentanyl .

"High street chain WHSmith openly advertised titles with disturbingly graphic content on its website, right next to children's literature . WHSmith was last night accused of profiting from the sale of vile books glorifying violent pornography, rape, incest and bestiality. The high street chain openly advertised titles with disturbingly graphic content on its website, right next to children’s literature. Typing the word ‘daddy’ into the search box, for instance, brings up disturbing fictional accounts of bondage and sexual humiliation, as well as collections of bedtime stories for youngsters. After The Mail on Sunday alerted WHSmith to the appalling content freely available on its website, executives took the unprecedented decision to take the whole site offline while the explicit ebooks were removed from sale. ‘We will tighten our processes to . ensure that this error can never happen again and sincerely apologise to . our customers for any offence caused,’ the company said in a statement. The . Mail on Sunday investigation found that pornographic ebooks – the . majority of which are self-published by their authors – are also . available through Amazon, Waterstones and Barnes & Noble. Yesterday afternoon more than 60 were available on the WHSmith site. Some . included graphic descriptions of incest, with titles such as Pregnant . With Daddy. Elsewhere, there were stories about disturbing sex attacks – . one described the rape of a ‘teen  virgin’ by three teachers at school. Politicians, charities and campaigners reacted with disbelief last night. John . Whittingdale, chairman of the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Select . Committee said: ‘It is disgusting that WHSmith, one of the country’s . most respected retailers, is selling hardcore pornography alongside . children’s books. ‘Retailers have a responsibility to . families and it is unacceptable that anyone could access this material . within a click of a mouse.’ The National Crime Agency warned yesterday that material appearing to legitimise child abuse ‘might feed the fantasies of  paedophiles and in some cases encourage child sexual abusers to commit contact offences.’ Justine Roberts of the parenting website Mumsnet said the books ‘glorified’ rape and incest, adding: ‘You would not expect to be able to access so easily hardcore pornography alongside children’s books.’ The scandal follows a pledge David Cameron made in July to make the internet safe for children and crack down on online pornography. Culture Secretary Maria Miller has warned of its ‘pernicious effect’ while charities say children as young as 11 are becoming addicted, giving them ‘unrealistic expectations’ of sex. Booksellers are thought to take a 30 per cent cut of all sales of ebooks under £6.60 and a 35 per cent cut of more expensive titles. WHSmith has a partnership deal with ebook company Kobo, with which it shares the profits for ebook sales. The high street chain has hailed its link with Kobo as being ‘a big driver’ of its profits. Within minutes, any author can sell their books via Amazon’s Kindle Direct Publishing service and set their own price. None of the titles carries any age restrictions, which means they can be downloaded by children on to their e-reader devices. Depravity on mainstream web stores: The National Crime Agency warned . yesterday that material appearing to legitimise child abuse ‘might feed . the fantasies of  paedophiles and in some cases encourage child sexual . abusers to commit contact offences’ Almost all the titles on Amazon and WHSmith’s website appear to violate the terms and conditions booksellers set themselves. Some of the material is filtered by Amazon, but the online retailer also sells an ebook instructing users on which search terms to use to find the more extreme material. Many of the titles feature cynical caveats, such as assurances the girls involved are over 18 and that rapes are never carried out by ‘blood relations’. In most of the ‘incest erotica’ books the perpetrator is a stepfather, though invariably referred to as ‘daddy’ in the text. WHSmith said last night: ‘We were made aware last week that a number of unacceptable titles were appearing on the Kobo website that has an automated feed to ours. This is totally unacceptable and we in no way whatsoever condone them. After The Mail on Sunday alerted WHSmith to the appalling content freely available on its website, executives took the unprecedented decision to take the whole site offline while the explicit ebooks were removed from sale . ‘We are urgently working with our ebook partner, Kobo, to remove them from our websites as soon as possible. We will tighten our processes to ensure that this error can never happen again and sincerely apologise to our customers for any offence caused.’ It is understood Amazon began  selling the ebooks in 2011 and WHSmith a year later. Barnes & Noble said its offensive titles were also ‘in the process of  being removed’. The company added: ‘When there are violations to the content policy that are brought to our attention, either through our internal process or from a customer or external source, we have a rapid response team in place to appropriately categorise or remove the content in accordance with our policy.’ Waterstones said: ‘As with other bookselling websites, Waterstones takes a feed from central databases of book publications, notably Nielsen. Any of these titles can then be ordered by a customer. We do not stock in our shops or in our warehouses for internet supply any of these titles and we have never had any ordered from us in the past. ‘Now that we are aware of the  theoretical ability of a customer to order such titles by fact of their  listing by Nielsen, we will investigate with them how this might  be avoided.’ When contacted by The Mail on Sunday, Amazon claimed: ‘These books are not available on Amazon.co.uk’, in reference only to works that had already been brought to  its attention. The retailers would not provide sales figures, however the authors of one book, entitled 10 Sexy Stories, an anthology featuring ‘reluctant sex’ scenes claims its writers sold more than 300,000 copies in 2012. Last night the Ministry of Justice said the retailers would be liable for prosecution if a judge deemed that the ebooks breached the Obscene Publications Act. The National Crime Agency said: ‘There is a need to think about criminalising the paedophilic written word in the same way as child abuse imagery and virtual images of children. ‘In the meantime, businesses who are aware that they are involved in the sharing of potentially paedophilic material can of course look to their consciences or consider the impact on their reputation.’","High street chain openly advertised .

"The cost of an average home will be close to £800,000 by the year 2040, it has been revealed today. The figure was produced using a formula based on government data which included housing forecasts and future housing inflation. It predicts that a child aged six today would have to pay out an average of £780,000 to get the keys to a new property in 26 years time. Scroll down for video . The cost of an average home will be close to £800,000 by the year 2040, according to an influential think tank . The statistics were produced by the think-tank The Policy Exchange which based its calculations on how much a house currently priced at £244,000 would set a buyer back in 2040 - given the average age of a first time buyer is currently 32. The Telegraph reports this morning that the organisation produced the figures as part of its claims that extra homes needed to be built in ‘garden cities’ around Britain. It comes after the think tank backed the Wolfson Economics Prize where architects were encouraged to submit proposals for garden cities. The house price forecast for 2040 was inspired by the fact a six-year-old boy had entered the competition, which was eventually won by design consultancy Urbed. The organisation's head of housing and planning, Chris Walker, told the Telegraph: ‘House prices are on average ten times higher than earnings in Britain. ‘This widens the gap between rich and poor, young and old, north and south. The situation is socially divisive and economically dangerous. ‘Even those who have enjoyed seeing the value of their home increase are now beginning to worry about how their children will be able to afford a home.’ It comes on the day that a banking body warned soaring house prices would mean a generation of buyers will only be able to buy a fraction of their home. A banking body has warned soaring house prices would mean a generation of buyers will only be able to buy a fraction of their home . The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) said many buyers will be forced into shared ownership deals, where the rest of their property is owned by housing associations or local developers. They then have to pay rent on the part they do not own. These deals are already common in parts of the country where house prices are high. But a report from the organisation said in future this could be a way of life for many. A CML spokesman said: ‘Affordability pressures may mean that, for some, full ownership is not an option, even in the long term.’ The CML added that more action was needed from the Government to solve the housing crisis. Paula Higgins, of the Homeowners Alliance, said: ‘This is a wake-up call for the Government to help those frozen out of the housing market. Owning a fraction of a home is not the solution, instead it is storing up problems for the future. 'It will be deeply sad for parents to see their children unable to afford to buy a home of their own even when they are in their 30s and 40s.’ Housing minister Brandon Lewis said home ownership was at its most affordable since 2007. ‘Shared ownership is just one of many options available to aspiring homeowners,’ he added.","A child aged six today will have to pay £800,000 for average home in 2040 .

"A men’s clothing store in India is being asked to change its name after the chosen 'Hitler' unsurprisingly upset the local community. Proprietor Rajesh Shah claims he was unaware that the name may cause offence as it derives from a nickname given to his business partner’s grandfather. The ‘Hitler’-store has provoked outrage among residents and the small Jewish community in Achmedabad in the Gujarat province. Rajesh Shah poses in a Mahatma Ghandi t-shirt outside his shop Hitler in Ahmedabad earlier today . Mr Shah says no harm was intended when they named the shop. ‘Frankly, until the time we applied for the trademark permission, I had only heard that Hitler was a strict man, he told the Times of India. ‘It was only recently that we read about Hitler on the internet.’ He says Hitler was a nickname given to his business partner Manish Chandani's grandfather due to the man’s strict nature and has nothing to do with the German dictator. But local Jews disagree and say the owners knew exactly what the name meant. Mr Shah claims he did not know who Hitler was until recently when he searched for the German dictator on the internet . Mr Shah shows a business card for his clothing shop, complete with a swastika in the dot over the i in Hitler . A . member of the Jewish community visited the store last week and told the . newspaper that the pair had researched the dictator 'right from the . dress to his cufflinks'. 'We had suggested a separate design, but the proprietors claimed that the name brings good business since its launch.' After a visit by Jews from the local synagogue expressing their concern, Mr Shah has said he is willing to change the name but only if he is compensated as he and his business partner has run out of money. Mr Shah claims all their funding of 40,000 rupee ( £454) had been spent on signs, business cards and advertising for ‘Hitler’ and that someone would have to pay for the re-branding of the clothes shop.

"The fate of three-time NASCAR champion Tony Stewart now rests in the hands of a grand jury, which will decide whether or not to charge him in the August death of a fellow driver. Ontario County District Attorney Michael Tantillo said Tuesday he made the decision to present the case to a grand jury after reviewing evidence collected by sheriff's investigators. Tantillo could have determined there was not enough evidence to support charges and dropped the case, but instead announced his decision more than a month after Stewart's car struck and killed Kevin Ward Jr. at a dirt-track race August 9. Scroll down for videos . A grand jury will decide whether NASCAR champion Tony Stewart will be charged in the death of fellow driver Kevin Ward at a sprint car race in upstate New York in August . In a statement, Stewart said he respects the time and effort authorities have spent 'investigating this tragic accident.' 'I look forward to this process being completed, and I will continue to provide my full cooperation,' he said. Ontario County District Attorney Michael Tantillo  made the decision to present the case to a grand jury after reviewing evidence in the case . Stewart-Haas Racing said Stewart will race in Sunday's NASCAR event at New Hampshire Motor Speedway.  Stewart spent three weeks in seclusion before returning for the final two races of the Sprint Cup season. He did not make the Chase for the Sprint Cup championship field, and finished 18th in the first Chase race Sunday at Chicagoland. County Sheriff Philip Povero spent weeks investigating the accident at the small track in Canandaigua, several times saying investigators did not have any evidence to support criminal intent by Stewart. Ward had spun while racing alongside Stewart and then the 20-year-old climbed out of his car and walked down the track, waving his arms in an apparent attempt to confront the 43-year-old NASCAR veteran. 'Upon my review of all of the information contained in the entire investigation,' Tantillo said, 'I have made the determination that it would be appropriate to submit the evidence to the grand jury for their determination as to what action should be taken in this matter.' He said the law prevented him from saying when the case would be scheduled or who would be called as witnesses. Experts have said Stewart could be charged with second-degree manslaughter under New York law if prosecutors believe he 'recklessly caused the death of another person,' with negligent homicide another possibility. The sheriff asked in the days after Ward's death for spectators to turn over photos and videos of the crash as investigators worked to reconstruct the accident. Victim: Kevin Ward Jr, 20, died August 9 after being struck by Stewart's car at a dirt-track race in upstate New York . Among the things being looked at were the dim lighting, how muddy it was and whether Ward's dark firesuit played a role in his death, given the conditions. In submitting his findings to the district attorney last week, Povero said they included a 'forensic video enhancement' from state police. After Ward's death, NASCAR announced a rule that prohibits drivers from climbing out of a crashed or disabled vehicle — unless it is on fire — until safety personnel arrive. Stewart, who has 48 career Cup wins in 542 starts, is one of the biggest stars in the garage. From the small town of Columbus, Indiana, he has long been one of the most proficient drivers in racing, winning in every kind of series, from sprint cars to the elite Sprint Cup Series. He has for years taken part in little races in nondescript towns because he loves the thrill of the high horsepower, lightweight cars skidding around the dirt. Cooperative: Stewart, left, pictured Saturday with Danica Patrick, responded to the grand jury announcement saying that he looks forward to the completion of the investigation . He rarely made his schedule public, popping up when he pleased, and he was welcome at the clay track at Canandaigua Motorsports Park the night before the NASCAR race in nearby Watkins Glen. NASCAR spokesman Brett Jewkes said the series was closely following the case. ""We are aware of the completed investigation and the announced next steps,"" he said. ""We will monitor this process and stay in close contact with Stewart-Haas Racing. It would be inappropriate for NASCAR to comment on this case so we will continue to respect the process and authorities involved."" Over the weekend, the No. 13 car belonging to Ward returned to racing at the Canadian Sprint Car Nationals at Ohsweken Speedway in Ontario. The car was driven by Ward's best friend, Dylan Swiernik, who finished 14th out of 30.  Afterward, Ward's father said he would sell the sprint car that his son drove. 'Life,' Kevin Ward Sr. told Canadian Press, 'just isn't the same without him.'

"'My name is Monica Lewinsky - though I've often been advised to change it.’ That is how the bete noire of the late 90s introduced herself to a large crowd of millennials at Forbes’ Under 30 Summit in Philadelphia Monday morning, marking the beginning of Ms Lewinsky’s first public speaking engagement in more than a dozen years. By the time Lewinsky concluded her emotional presentation on the perils of public humiliation in the digital age, the Twitter-sphere was abuzz with excitement over Lewinsky’s apparent comeback, showering her with praise for her courage. Scroll down for video . In her own words: Monica Lewinsky, 41, delivered a speech about bullying in the digital age at Forbes' Under 30 Summit . Rare appearance: This is one of Monica Lewinsky's few public speeches, she last  spoke publicly 13 years ago . Not ashamed: Lewinsky told a crowd of more than 1,000 she fell in love with President Clinton as a 24-year-old woman straight out of college . Lewinsky, 41, joined Twitter less than two hours before taking the stage at the Forbes conference, where she was invited to speak about the ‘scourge of harassment in the digital age.’ ‘Overnight I went from being a completely private figure to a publicly humiliated one. I was Patient Zero, the first person to have their reputation completely destroyed worldwide via the Internet,’ Ms Lewinsky told a rapt crowd in a room where, according to multiple eyewitness accounts shared on Twitter, one could hear a pin drop. Lewinsky, best known worldwide for her sordid affair with President Bill Clinton, did not mince words when addressing that part of her biography. ‘Sixteen years ago, fresh out of college...I fell in love with my boss,’ Lewinsky declared from the stage in Philadelphia, before launching into an impassioned speech about the price she had been forced to pay for her youthful indiscretion. Sequel: For her second tweet, Lewinsky shared her excitement about taking part in Forbes Magazine's 30 Under 30 Summit in Philadelphia . Inaugural tweet: Monica Lewinsky joined Twitter Monday, sending out the hashtag 'HereWeGo' as her first-ever message . ‘I lost my public self, or had it stolen,’ she said of her ruthless treatment at the hands of journalists and late-night comics. ‘In a way, it was a form of identity theft. ‘In 1998, ""public Monica, that Monica, that woman"" was born. I was publicly identified and someone I did not recognize.’ Looking back on her experiences, Lewinsky explained to the 20- and 30-somethings in the audience that while there was no social media back in the 90s, there were 'gossip, news and entertainment websites' that latched onto the Clinton scandal, relishing each detail with gusto. 'Of course, it was all done on the excruciatingly slow dial up. Yet around the world this story went,' she recalled, according to Forbes. 'A viral phenomenon that, you could argue, was the first moment of truly ""social media.”' Fighting back tears, Ms Lewinsky talked about how her mother was devastated by the suicide of bullied Rutgers University freshman Tyler Clementi in 2010. ‘She was back in 1998...when she might've lost me,’ Lewinsky confided in the audience, referring to the year when Drudge Report broke the news of her affair with the president online. In the months that followed the bombshell revelations, an emotional Ms Lewinsky said she was constantly tormented by thoughts of suicide. Despite overwhelming odds, Lewinsky said she somehow managed to survive the bullying, relentless harassment and public humiliation, but her outlook for the future is tinged with pessimism. ‘There is a compassion crisis, an empathy deficit,’ she pointed out. ‘There's no way to wrap your head around when it will end.’ Lewinsky used her first foray into the public sphere in more than a decade to announce her plan to launch a 'cultural revolution' against cyber-bullying. The 41-year-old said she was inspired by Tyler Clementi's story to share her own tale of hardship and perseverance in a bid to prevent the next tragedy. 'Having survived myself, what I want to do now is help other victims of the shame game survive, too,' she said. 'I want to put my suffering to good use and give purpose to my past.' At the conclusion of her remarks, the audience gave Ms Lewinsky a roaring standing ovation. Guests at the summit took to Twitter, describing Lewinsky’s speech as both ‘courageous’ and 'inspiring.’ The three-day conference hosted by Forbes Magazine opened  in Philadelphia Sunday. According to the description of the event on Forbes' website, the summit brings together more than 1,000 members of Forbes '30 Under 30' list of 'business leaders and mentors'. 'Lewinsky, who last talked publicly 13 years ago, will offer a singular perspective on what happened to her, and the scourge of harassment in the digital age,' Forbes explained in a statement. Besides Ms Lewisnky, speakers at the summit will include this year's Nobel Peace Prize recipient Malala Yousafzai, musician Questlove and model-turned-philanthropist Petra Nemcova. With the hashtag #HereWeGo, Lewinsky joined the Twitter community Monday just after 9am Eastern time, drawing more than 1,400 followers in the first 40 minutes. By 10.15am, Lewinsky, 41, already had 6,000 followers, and counting. After firing off her first tweet, Lewinsky quickly got the ball rolling, writing less than an hour later: 'excited (and nervous) to speak to #Under30Summit.' Ms Lewinsky became a household name – and the butt of countless late-night jokes - after her affair with President Bill Clinton was leaked to the press in 1998, ultimately resulting in Clinton's impeachment. After living in relative obscurity for more than a decade, Lewinsky penned an explosive tell-all article for Vanity Fair in May about the Clinton scandal and its destructive aftermath, describing her relationship with the married president as 'consensual.' 'Sure, my boss took advantage of me, but I will always remain firm on this point: it was a consensual relationship. Any ‘abuse’ came in the aftermath, when I was made a scapegoat in order to protect his powerful position,' Lewinsky wrote. Claim to fame: Lewinsky, pictured left next to Bill Clinton during her time as a White House intern, became a household name after her affair with the president  was leaked to the press in 1998 . 'The Clinton administration, the special prosecutor’s minions, the political operatives on both sides of the aisle, and the media were able to brand me. And that brand stuck, in part because it was imbued with power.' She has since written several opinion pieces for the publication, including a blog post about cyber-bullying published in July, in which she talked about her reaction to 'Monica' jokes on the hit Netflix series Orange is the New Black. She also recently weighed in on the ongoing controversy surrounding hacked nude photos of female celebrities, writing in a personal essay that she felt outrage at the gross violation of privacy and compassion for the likes of Kate Upton and Jennifer Lawrence.","Lewinsky, 41, spoke at Forbes' Under 30 Summit in Philadelphia Monday .

"A new survey has revealed that many probiotic drinks and supplements are likely to have no health benefits . Many probiotic drinks and supplements are likely to have no health benefits, according to a survey. In a number of them, the ‘good’ bacteria said to aid digestion barely even made it to the ‘target’ area, the small intestine. Scientists at University College London put eight probiotic products through three tests and found only one passed them all. Study author Dr Simon Gaisford, of UCL’s School of Pharmacy, said: ‘Just swallowing them is no good if the stomach then kills everything.’ Researchers investigated whether products contained as many live bacteria as claimed, whether the bacteria survived passing through the acidic stomach environment and whether they then flourished in the small intestine. Four – Align, Biobalance, Bio-Kult and Probio 7 – did not pass a single test. Yogurt drink Yakult contained enough bacteria but failed on the next two stages, while rival Actimel fell short on the number of bacteria surviving the stomach. Only water-based barley drink Symprove passed all three challenges. Bacteria in the product VSL#3 survived the stomach and flourished in the small intestine. However, it contained fewer live bacteria than stated. The study, using pig stomach fluids, will be published in the journal Beneficial Microbes. It adds to the debate about the benefits of probiotics. Research earlier this week suggested a daily dose of friendly bacteria could stave off colds. Bio-Kult said its capsules have been comprehensively researched. Yakult said independent studies showed its bacteria survived through the human gut at a high level. Six in ten UK households regularly buy probiotic drinks and supplements, which claim to be bursting with health-boosting ‘friendly bacteria’. The probiotic market is estimated to be worth £19.7 billion globally. Dr Gaisford, said probiotics in liquid form performed better than capsules and recommended anyone using a probiotic should take it on an empty stomach after waking. Dr Rob Hicks, a GP and media doctor, said probiotics were a ‘phenomenon’ and the ‘astonishing’ results should help shoppers make better decisions . Waiting at least 10 minutes afterwards before eating will help reduce the chance of the beneficial bacteria being killed by stomach fluids, he said. Dr Rob Hicks, a GP and media doctor, said probiotics were a ‘phenomenon’ and the ‘astonishing’ results should help shoppers make better decisions. ‘Some people take them as a form of health insurance and some take them for chronic disorders such as IBS and are often not particularly satisfied with conventional medicine,’ he said . ‘Lots of products claim to work but the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) have basically said there’s not enough scientific evidence for probiotics to make health claims.’ Symprove weren’t involved in the research but did provide funding to write up the results.","Scientists put eight probiotic drinks through three tests to asses health benefits .

"An emaciated boxer dog - its bones clearly visible beneath its fur - stares sadly into the camera after being rescued. He is one of two boxers, two-year-old brothers, which were rushed to a veterinary centre run by the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ISPCA) for life-saving treatment. They feature in a new episode of TV3-show Animal A&E, which investigates the 'epidemic' of unwanted and discarded dogs in Ireland. Scroll down for video . Malnourished: The ribs on this neglected boxer dog can be clearly seen through its fur after it was rescued by the ISPCA . The dogs were filmed being treated by ISPCA staff, as the show's presenter Andrea Hayes and the team look on. The horrifying state of the animals reflects the plight of a growing 'epidemic' of discarded dogs that are dealt by the ISPCA's officers. The programme, which airs tomorrow at 7.30pm also features a small terrier named Memphis which had been dumped over the eight foot-tall security fence at Ireland's Dog's Trust charity - despite the building being open to the public at the time. Ms Hayes said: 'We went to the ISPCA . centre in Longford and we got a call to say two boxer dogs had been brought in. They were . among the most severely neglected dogs the inspector had seen. 'They were completely anaemic and severely malnourished. It would have taken quite a lot of time to get them so starved. Sad: Inspectors said the two dogs, which are two-year-old brothers, were amongst the most malnourished they had seen . 'They had sores on their body which showed their skin was a closed to the bone as it could get.' ISPCA Inspector, Conor Dowling said . 'irresponsible' dog ownership is a 'major animal welfare issue in . Ireland with far too many owners not embracing concepts such as . neutering and microchipping. 'We produce far too many puppies in Ireland,' he said, 'and this is reflected in the cases of canine cruelty and neglect that we encounter on a daily basis and the numbers of dogs discarded in our pounds.' Mark Beazley, executive director of the Dogs Trust said: 'Unfortunately, we are seeing over 1,200 stray and abandoned dogs coming through our doors every year. 'People are still taking on the responsibility of dog ownership without enough consideration of what it entails,' he said, 'a dog is for life. 'We hope that by working with organisations such as TV3 and the ISPCA we can highlight this issue and inform the public to really think about what is involved in owning a dog for life.' The two boxers featured on the show have recovered from their ordeal and are due to be re-homed.","Inspectors said dogs were amongst most emaciated they had ever seen .

"Hero: Ray Ellis was the last surviving veteran of the 'Battle of Knightsbridge' - one of the most celebrated acts of bravery in the Royal Artillery's history . The last soldier to fire on advancing German troops in one of the Second World War’s most important battles has died aged 94. Ray Ellis, who died in Nottingham, was also the last surviving veteran of the famous 'Battle of Knightsbridge' in 1942. The battle - one of the most celebrated acts of bravery in the Royal Artillery’s history - saw the 107th Regiment of the South Nottinghamshire Hussars virtually wiped out. Former Hussar Captain Gil Aldridge hailed Mr Ellis as the last soldier to fire on the Germans at the end of the battle. Ordered to 'fight to the last man and the last round', they stuck to their guns as their comrades fell around them. For three days, the band of Desert Rats suffered relentless Panzer attacks and mounting casualties as they held the line in North Africa from German Field Marshal Erwin 'Desert Fox' Rommel's advancing tanks. Their heroism during one of the bloodiest battles of the Second World War was later immortalised on canvas. Mr Ellis was captured and taken to a prisoner of war camp, but launched a daring escape and found shelter with a sympathetic family. He was shipped from Libya to the camp in Italy but escaped by marching out of the main gate as if on a work party and hid in the mountains for a year. A young girl discovered him and led him to the farming family who sheltered him. Mr Ellis named one of his daughters, Nerina, after her, and has returned regularly to the hill village of Massa Fermana, near Ancona, to visit the family who kept him alive. Describing the events of the last day of the battle on June 6, 1942, Mr Ellis told how he remained at his 25-pounder gun and witnessed the death of the shirtless comrade beside him. He said: ‘My regiment had been given the order to fight to the last man and the last round and not to retire, and this painting shows our position after a long day's battle. I fought in that battle. ‘The regiment was almost wiped out - but by some miracle, I was the last man virtually, and I fired the last round. That round, which was at about six o'clock at night, hit a Mark IV tank. Dead at 92: Mr Ellis wrote a book about his experiences in the Battle of Gazala in 1942, called Once a Hussar, which was published last year. He is pictured with the Italian version of the book . Battle of Knightsbridge: For three days in 1942, the men suffered relentless Panzer attacks and mounting casualties. Their heroism was later immortalised on canvas in this 1978 war painting by Terence Cuneo . 'Then the man standing at the side of me . was killed because a German tank had come up behind us and fired its . machine gun, almost point blank. And I took a deep breath and waited . for mine. 'For some . reason the tank didn't fire and I survived and am still here. You feel . guilty for having survived. I found my comrade Jim Hardy lying nearby. He had been cut in two. 'I took his water bottle and drank his water. I was in tears when I was taken prisoner.' Mr . Ellis was among 90 men from his regiment who were captured at the . Battle of Knightsbridge, ironically named - possibly by a homesick . soldier - because it was a barren desert crossing.

Decorated: Ray Ellis was captured and taken to a prisoner of war camp during the Second World War, but launched a daring escape and found shelter with a sympathetic family. He is pictured with actor Michael Palin . The location of the Battle of Knightsbridge, which took place in 1942, was ironically named because it was a barren desert crossing. The three-day fight  formed part of the Battle of Gazala - fought from May 26 to June 20, 1942 - which was seen as German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel’s (above) greatest triumph. The British army suffered relentless Panzer attacks and mounting casualties as they held the line in North Africa from Rommel’s advancing tanks. They had been ordered to delay the Germans at ‘Knightsbridge’ to protect the 8th Army as it withdrew. The climax of the attack came at Knightsbridge, near Bir Hacheim in Libya, as Rommel hit back upon every British counter-attack and destroyed the British forces. Some 90 men from 107th Regiment of the South Notts Hussars (badge above) were captured - including Mr Ellis - while the rest of the regiment were killed. The rest of the regiment, which had already served in the nine-month Siege of Tobruk the year before, were killed. Captain Aldridge said yesterday: ‘I believe he was going to marry a girl who was part of that Italian family but it didn't happen, although I understand he went back and visited them every year. ‘He was a man who definitely had his wits about him but he was a gentleman, and that is what everyone said about him.’ Mr Ellis wrote a book about his experiences in the Battle of Gazala in 1942, called Once a Hussar, which was published last year. He was also invited to the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst to talk to recruits about his experiences. His bravery was praised by Lieutenant Colonel David Young, president of the South Notts Hussars' Association, whose uncle, Col Billy Seely, was commanding officer and died at the Battle of Knightsbridge. He said: ‘Ray Ellis was a true and proud South Notts Hussar. ‘His exploits during the last war, from . his joining the regiment in 1939, his survival at Knightsbridge, his . imprisonment and ultimate escape from a PoW camp in Italy, so valuably . recorded in his book Once a Hussar, have become a valuable archive as to . what happened to a volunteer soldier.

'You feel guilty for having survived. I found my comrade lying nearby. He had been cut in two' Ray Ellis . ‘His recent lectures at Sandhurst are an acknowledgement of the respect and high regard with which he was held within the Army as well as being an inspiration to both students and instructing staff alike.’ Mr Ellis, a former sergeant, died last Tuesday at the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham. Col Tim Richmond, Honorary Colonel of the South Notts Hussars, said: ‘We regarded Ray and all those who fought as a band of brothers at Tobruk and Knightsbridge as heroes and the sacrifices that they made will never be forgotten.’","Ray Ellis, who died in Nottingham, was last surviving veteran of 1942 battle .

"A man with one arm has been told he cannot have a disabled parking permit - unless he loses another limb. Roy Sowerby, 58, was refused a blue badge for his vehicle by Middlesbrough Council 'because he has two legs'. The father-of-five has been registered as disabled since losing an arm after it was crushed in an industrial accident 11 years ago. Scroll down for video . 'Not disabled enough': Roy Sowerby, 58, was told by Middlesbrough Council that he would need to lose another limb to qualify for a Blue Badge parking permit . He has used a Blue Badge permit for his car for the last three years but when he recently went to renew it, he was told he no longer qualified. Mr Sowerby, from Middlesbrough, finds pushing a shopping trolley extremely challenging and claims he needs to park closer to the supermarket to make it easier. He said: 'I'd like the council to tell me how I am not disabled. They said if I lost another arm or a leg then I would qualify for one. 'So do I have to cut off my legs or my arm or my head to qualify for one? 'They said I can't have one because I can carry a bag but I can't carry anything bulky or heavy or big.' The Blue Badge scheme allows drivers to park in spaces closer to their destination and is recognised in most European countries. Outraged: The father-of-five is appalled that he is not able to renew the disabled parking permit after three years of using it . Middlesbrough Council said Mr Sowerby is no longer eligible under new rules drawn up in 2012 by the Department for Transport (DfT). The authority said Blue Badges are issued for three years and applications for permits are 'required to undergo independent assessment to determine their eligibility'. A spokesman said: 'Those applying for a discretionary Blue Badge must have a severe disability in both arms or a permanent and substantial disability that causes inability to walk or very considerable difficulty in walking.' 'The criteria for eligibility in the first instance are that the applicant has a severe disability in both arms, regularly drives an adapted or non-adapted motor vehicle regularly, and also considerable difficulty in operating parking meters. New rules: Middlesbrough Council claim new rules introduced in 2010 require 'a severe disability in both arms or a permanent and substantial disability that causes inability to walk or very considerable difficulty in walking' 'To qualify for a Blue Badge all three criteria must be met. The DfT state that ""in no circumstances should anyone who does not satisfy all three of the conditions set out above receive a badge"". 'The guidance adds that ""in particular, a badge should not be issued to a person who travels solely as a passenger or a person who has difficulty carrying parcels, shopping or other heavy objects such as luggage"".' In 2010, a woman with one leg was also told she was 'not disabled enough' to claim a blue badge, because she could walk with difficulty for more than 30 yards. Julia Pearson, from Worcestershire, said at the time: 'It's made me feel pretty sick with it all, and it has upset me. I don't know what to do now.'","Roy Sowerby, 58, had his arm crushed in an industrial accident 11 years ago .

"Defamation: Boyle is to use the money awarded in his libel action to help Mr Aamer sue the intelligence services . Controversial comedian Frankie Boyle has pledged to donate £50,000 he won in a libel victory to help a British resident languishing in Guantanamo Bay sue the intelligence services. The television comedian, known for jokes about Rebecca Adlington, Katie Price's disabled son and the Queen, has pledged to help the legal action by Shaker Aamer, the last remaining British resident in Guantanamo. The Glaswegian comic has joined forces with charity Reprieve, which has represented inmates at Guatanamo and is helping Mr Aamer sue the intelligence services over accusations they have defamed him. Boylr said: 'I can’t even call it a . miscarriage of justice, because he’ s never even had a trial. We just . want to see him back home.' The entertainer, known for his time as a panelist on Mock The Week, was awarded more than £54,000 damages in October after a High Court jury found he had been libelled by a newspaper which described him as 'racist'. According to The Independent, Boyle is now to use the money to help Mr Aamer take his action forward. Aamer is the only British resident left in the centre in Cuba after being arrested in Afghanistan in 2001. He has been cleared for released under both the Bush and Obama administrations and yet remains imprisoned. The UK government says it wants Aamer to return 'as a matter of urgency', but he is still to be handed over by the US authorities. The director of Reprieve Clive Stafford Smith said: 'They [the security services] go around saying all these awful things about him, which aren’t true. 'And say that this doesn’t infringe his good character. 'It’s just laughable. All we want is our day in court, where these allegations would never stand up.' Detained: Mr Aamer has remained imprisoned by the US since 2001, despite twice being cleared for release . A Foreign Office spokesman said it could not comment on ongoing legal proceedings. The spokesman said: 'Mr Aamer’s case remains a high priority for the UK Government and we continue to make clear to the US that we want him released and returned to the UK as a matter of urgency. 'Ministers and senior officials continue to raise Mr Aamer’s case with their US counterparts. 'However,  any decision regarding Mr Aamer’s release ultimately remains in the hands of the United States Government.' Watched: Detainees in orange jumpsuits sit in a holding area under the watchful eyes of Military Police at Camp X-Ray at Naval Base Guantanamo Bay . Aamer came to the UK from Saudi Arabia in 1996. In 2001, he took his family to Afghanistan to work with Islamic charities. But the CIA alleges that he was a member of Al Qaeda who was known to Osama Bin Laden. When the American-led forces invaded Afghanistan later that year, Mr Aamer was picked up by a local militia and handed over to US troops. He was detained for three months at the US-run Bagram airbase and an American prison in Kandahar before being flown to Guantanamo. Green MP Caroline Lucas, who supports the action, said: 'The defamation of Shaker Aamer is evidence of the immense power of the security services to say whatever they want behind the backs of an accused man, to devastating effect.'","Scottish comic to help last remaining Briton inmate sue MI6 for defamation .

"A mother who was told to have an abortion because her baby’s chance of survival was so low has given birth to Britain’s only ‘double dwarf’. Nathan Phillips, who is three months old, was born healthy and fit to Laura Whitfield, 24, and her fiancé, Nathan Phillips, 34, both of whom have restricted growth. Both of the parents have different forms of dwarfism and the new arrival has stunned medical experts by inheriting both types. As a result, his mother has hailed him a 'double dwarf'. Baby Nathan Phillips is believed to be the only person in the UK with two forms of dwarfism. His parents, Nathan and Laura, both have different types of dwarfism and the baby inherited both . Though doctors do not yet know what impact it will have on the baby they say there is no reason to believe he won’t lead a relatively normal life. Ms Whitfield, from Sunderland, said that his safe arrival was a huge relief after she was advised early in the pregnancy that the baby may only survive half an hour, if born alive. Doctors told her to consider an abortion after irregularities in scans caused professionals to worry the youngster had inherited a deadly combination of genes. But Ms Whitfield, who had complications throughout the pregnancy, ignored advice and decided to carry on with the pregnancy. Nathan's parents were advised to abort him as doctors feared he would not survive for more than an hour after his birth, if he survived the birth . Mr Phillips and Ms Whitfield refused to abort their baby and Nathan is now a healthy three-month-old . She was then told that both she and the baby would need special care after the birth - if he survived. The mother prepared herself for the prospect of not seeing her newborn baby after having a C-section under general anaesthetic. Doctors say they are not aware of any other babies in the UK who share Nathan Phillips' combination of dwarfism. Dr Michael Wright, a consultant clinical geneticist at Newcastle upon Tyne Hospital Trust said: 'Nathan has achondroplasia and pseudoachondroplasia and although the two have similar names they are two very difference and distinct conditions. 'They are a combination I have personally seen before - but only in a child in the U.S. in 1997. 'It is a very rare condition and I am not aware of anymore children in our region with it, and I have sought advice from other colleagues in other parts of the country, and they too are not aware of any other children who have both.' Dr Wright, who is Nathan's consultant, added: 'It is not a common combination.' Dr Anand Saggar, a consultant in clinical genetics at London’s St George's Hospital and also in Harley Street, told MailOnline it is rare for a child to have two different forms of dwarfism. He said that both pseudoachondroplasia and achondroplasia are both dominant genetic conditions. This means that if a couple who each have a different form of dwarfism have a child, that child will have: . A 25 per cent chance of inheriting neither condition, a 25 per cent chance of inheriting both conditions and a 50 per cent chance of inheriting one but not the other. He explained that children with two different form of dwarfism are likely to have 'poorer outcomes' than those that just have one type. This is because they can develop symptoms associated with each of the two conditions. But she was amazed when she woke from the operation to find her fiancé sitting at her bedside with the newborn by his side. Ms Whitfield, who has appeared in a number of films such as Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, said: ‘I was having scans once a week because they were a little worried there could be complications. ‘It wasn’t until 24 or 25 weeks that things started changing. They noticed that his measurements weren’t quite what they should be. ‘They thought that he had inherited two rare genes that could have been dangerous. ‘I was told to consider abortion and told that if he had these genes he would probably die within half an hour of birth. ‘I didn’t even think about abortion . at any point - I don’t believe in abortion. I could feel him moving . around inside me - he was a little wriggler. In my head everything was . fine. ‘When I went down . to theatre to have him I was so worried - they had been very cautious . with us and said that there was a high chance we would need special care . after he was born and that I might not see him. ‘When I woke up Nathan was stood next to me with little Nathan in a cot. I couldn’t believe it - I just cried.’ Ms Whitfield, who is the only person . with dwarfism in her family, has achondroplasia - meaning she has . shortened limbs as well as a curvature of the spine - causing serious . pain. Mr Phillips, who lived in Bristol . before meeting Ms Whitfield, has a different form of dwarfism - . pseudoachondroplasia, which means his bone growth is stunted and he has . weak hips. Experts fear . that baby Nathan may inherit back and hip problems due to having both . strands of dwarfism, but it is not yet known if he will have either. His mother said that she hopes Nathan will be able to live a normal life, much like herself, despite his condition. She . added that while she was sure Nathan was the only person in the UK to . become a 'double dwarf', the condition had been heard of elsewhere in . the world. Ms Whitfield (centre) is an actress who has appeared in Channel 4's Seven Dwarves (pictured) as well as in one of the Harry Potter films . Doctors do not really know what impact the 'double dwarfism' will have on Nathan but they believe he has every chance of leading a relatively normal life . She said: ‘Nathan has inherited both forms of dwarfism and is therefore a double dwarf. ‘The doctors have never come across it before. They have heard about it but they really don’t know much - they have no idea what the problems caused will be or anything. ‘At the moment they are watching him quite carefully because they don’t really know what to expect. ‘The problem is that because of his dwarfism big Nathan has very bad hips, which causes him to walk a little unusually. ‘My dwarfism means I have a curvature of the spine and am often in a lot of pain. Ms Whitfield said: 'I didn't even think about abortion at any point - I don't believe in abortion. I could feel him moving around inside me - he was a little wriggler. In my head everything was fine' Mr Phillips and Ms Whitfield (left) hope their baby will lead a relatively normal life, as they do . ‘We are hoping that little Nathan will get my hips and his dad’s spine so that he can avoid both these problems but I guess ultimately he might end up with both. ‘I am hoping that he will have a fairly normal life like I have had. ‘My family are all normal size so nothing was ever really adapted for me - I would just have to work around it. ‘I’m not sure he is the only person in the world with the condition but he is certainly the only person in the UK. ‘Doctors have heard a bit about it before so it might be that people in America or something have had it before.’ Mr Phillips has problems with his hips and Ms Whitfield has a curved spine which causes her a lot of pain. Doctors are worried that Nathan might develop both of these problems . Ms Whitfield (pictured during the countdown to the Olympics) used to be a swimmer who swam for England . Mr Phillips and Ms Whitfield met in December 2012 whilst performing in pantomime on the Channel 4 documentary Seven Dwarves. The pair got engaged in March 2013 and Laura became pregnant in April 2013, though they had not been trying for a baby. Despite the new arrival delaying marriage plans, the couple hope to tie the knot later this year or early next year. Though they are not quite sure what . is in store with baby Nathan they say they will remain patient in the . hope he will lead a life as enjoyable as theirs. Ms Whitfield said: ‘I wouldn’t have been able to cope if little Nathan hadn’t made it. ‘We . really aren’t sure what we can expect to happen with little Nathan now, . doctors have said he probably won’t start learning to walk until he is . at least 18 months. Ms Whitfield (centre) and Mr Phillips (far left) now plan to get married. They are pictured with their friends from Channel 4's Seven Dwarves . ‘I guess we will just have to be patient and make sure we don’t pick him up or discourage him in any way.’ Doctors today confirmed they were not aware of any other babies in the UK who shared Nathan Phillips' combination of conditions. Dr Michael Wright, a consultant clinical geneticist at Newcastle upon Tyne Hospital Trust said: 'Nathan has achondroplasia and pseudoachondroplasia and although the two have similar names they are two very difference and distinct conditions. 'They are a combination I have personally seen before - but only in a child in the States in 1997. 'It is a very rare condition and I am not aware of anymore children in our region with it, and I have sought advice from other colleagues in other parts of the country, and they too are not aware of any other children who have both.'

"Property prices in London are soaring beyond the means of many would-be homeowners. But if you are willing to look further afield, you could become lord of a magnificent country manor for a fraction of the price of a simple apartment in the capital. Estate agents Foxtons say the average price of a two-bedroom flat in the very heart of London has now risen to almost £1.1million. A typical example in Kensington - not far from Hyde Park - boasts just one reception room and a bathroom, in comparison to the roomy, remote locations on offer outside of the capital. Yet if you don’t need to commute, you could buy a substantial historic home in Shropshire or Dorset for about half that price. Here is our pick of some of the properties currently available... West Yorkshire: If you like people, the 1830s-built High Gables outside Leeds has eight bedrooms, ideal for guests. If you don't, it's surrounded by trees at the end of its own gravel drive, so you can remain a recluse. But beware: the decor is more dated than a Bruce Forsyth joke . Suffolk: A Victorian church in the village of Culford Heath has been converted into a three-bedroom home, with stained-glass windows intact.  And what home is complete without double cart lodge, as this one boasts? Berwickshire: Man the battlements. The five-bedroom Georgian-built Stoneshiel Hall near Berwick-upon-Tweed has a distinctive crenellated roof. It's also near to the beach... but it is a Scottish beach, so take your cagoule. Worcestershire: With eight bedrooms, Pickersleigh Court could house several adults... or several million woodworm if you don't keep the timber frames treated. A Malvern landmark, dating from the 15th Century, it has a music room, drawing room, and even a formal rose  garden. The adjoining paddock has planning permission for four detached houses, should it not yet be quite big enough for you . Dorset: If you're prepared to tackle the upkeep of a thatched roof, this picture-postcard 1800s cottage (originally built as a pair) has four bedrooms and more charm than you could want. It's not all old, though, as there's a newly refurbished conservatory with underfloor heating . Shropshire: More property, vicar? Originally dating from 1588, this  three-bedroom house was once the village vicarage for Lydbury North - and it boasts barns, a stable block and a vegetable and fruit garden. There's also a small orchard . Berwickshire: If you fancy yourself as the next Basil Fawlty, this 1757-built, seven-bedroom country house eight miles from Berwick-upon-Tweed could be converted into a guest house. It comes with an acre of land and great views, too. Kensington: Instead of any of the above rural gems, a two-bedroom flat in this building not far from Hyde Park, Central London, would set you back £1.1million . Argyll and Bute: Something of a commute from anywhere - it's 19 miles to the nearest station (Oban) then three hours to Glasgow - the 16th Century Kilmartin Castle, which has three bedrooms and two towers, was once owned by the Campbell clan . East Yorkshire: A special bargain, this seven-bedroom Edwardian house  in Elloughton Dale comes with eight acres, a billiard room and an orangery. Nine months ago it was on the market for £1.7million - now agents are asking 'just' £950,000 . Warning: Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said that the UK must build new houses to avoid boom and bust . The . Governor of the Bank of England has issued a stark warning that the . booming housing market is now the biggest single threat to the economy – . and said that the country must build more houses if it wants to avoid . further catastrophic boom-and-bust cycles. Mark . Carney said not enough homes were being constructed to meet demand, and . that there were signs that an increasing number of buyers were . beginning to borrow heavily again. His warning comes as house  prices soar in some parts of Britain – although in other areas they remain stagnant. Mr . Carney said: ‘The biggest  risk to financial stability, and therefore . to the durability of the expansion – those risks centre in the housing . market, and that’s why we are focused on that.’ Contrasting . Britain with his native Canada, he added: ‘The issues around the . housing market in  the UK… [are] that there are not sufficient houses . built in the UK. ‘[There . are] half as many people in Canada as in the UK, [but] twice as many . houses are built in Canada every year than in the UK.’ Official . figures show 112,000 homes were constructed in England in the 12 months . to March and that the number of new properties being started is rising. But the figure is still far below the 177,000 houses built in 2007. Mr . Carney – who issued the warning in an interview with Sky News’s Dermot . Murnaghan, to be broadcast today – also revealed there was a risk that . home buyers are borrowing heavily once again, with signs that loans of . four times a person’s salary or more were starting to increase. ‘We . don’t want to build up another big debt overhang that is going to hurt . individuals and is very much going to slow the economy in the medium . term,’ he said. ‘We . would be concerned if there were rapid increases in high  loan-to-value . mortgages across the banks... we’ve seen that creeping  up and it’s . something that we are watching closely.’ The . Bank of England has kept interest rates at a record low of 0.5 per . cent, despite pleas from some economists that action is needed to calm . the bubble emerging in some regions. Last . week, Mr Carney said the Bank judged the economy was still fragile and . indicated rate rises were unlikely in  the near future. When they came . they would be ‘limited’: ‘The recovery is neither balanced nor . sustainable,’ he said. The Bank is widely expected to use tools other than an interest- rate rise to stem excessive borrowing. Under . new powers granted to it as part of an overhaul of financial . regulation, it could require banks to set aside more capital reserves . against home loans or tighten rules on lending. The . Bank’s Financial Policy Committee, which is chaired by the Governor and . is in charge of the stability of the financial system, is expected to . outline how it might use those powers next month. Estate agents are forcing desperate buyers to stump up thousands of pounds in unexpected fees to secure a home in Britain’s increasingly heated property market. A probe has now been launched into the ‘borderline illegal’, but increasingly widespread, practice. Typically levied at two to 2.5 per cent of the sale price, the charge is paid by buyers who win a ‘sealed bid’ tender process, and means  the agent is making money from both buyer and seller. Property Ombudsman Christopher Hamer said he was ‘very concerned’ over the practice, which is most common in the hotspots of the South East. He told The Mail on Sunday  he was seeking legal advice, adding: ‘The agents’ clear legal obligations are to the seller and entering into a contract with prospective buyers may well compromise that, and be seen as a conflict of interest.’ HomeOwners Alliance chief Paula Higgins said: ‘It allows the agents  to cream even more money from both sides at a time when houses are practically selling themselves.’ But agents who impose the fees insist they are acting in a legal and transparent way which brings more buyers to the market. The entire South Devon hamlet of Bantham is going on the market on Friday, complete with beach, boathouses, golf course and pub. All 728 acres have been owned by the same family for generations, and will have an asking price of £10million. The . sleepy settlement - which has one pub and and a village shop - was . bought up by a military commander in 1922, and most residents rent their . properties. Scenic: The view over Bantham, a sleepy hamlet which is on sale for £10million . And now - thanks to a dispute over a food van - its 21 homes and other properties will be sold to the highest bidder. When . Gillian Goddard - one of the estate's five directors - allowed a . 'gastrobus' to sell food and drink to visitors, she was deluged by . complaints from locals attacking her act of 'commercialisation'. This, according to The Times, . caused her to change her mind about bequeathing the estate to the . visitors, and she amended her will to demand the village be put on the . market. Picturesque: The view over the bay from Bantham in South Devon . Unspoilt: The Bantham cliffs, which could soon be sold off to developers . She . died in November, triggering the sale, which is being run by estate . agents Strutt and Parker. If no single buyer emerges, they intend to . split the village into six separate lots. The prospect of a new landlord has alarmed residents - many of whom rent their homes. Rod . Seymour, the landlord of the Sloop Inn pub in the hamlet, said: 'The . same families have lived here for generations. We came here five years . ago and since then only one property has been sold.' Another . said: 'People are nervous, of course they are. We’re worried that . someone from London will see an ‘opportunity’. They’ll kick the tenants . out and turn the cottages into a ""boutique hotel"".'","According to recent estimates, a two-bedroom flat in central London will now set buyers back by around £1.1million .

Then, as the newsreader says 'he admits shooting Reeva Steenkamp' screams are heard in the background followed by what sounds like laughing. During the trial that day in Pretoria, prosecution . witness Michelle Burger told the court she had heard 'bloodcurdling' screams on the night of Ms Steenkamp's death. Pistorius admits shooting his 29-year-old girlfriend, but denies murder, saying he mistook the model for an intruder. The blooper happened at around 1pm on Monday on during the Vic Minett show. At the end of the broadcast, the DJ says: 'Apologies as well for a couple technical problems during that news bulletin. A few odd things sneaking in there.' The BBC later said the blunder had been the result of a 'technical mistake' after sound effects being put together in another studio for a different programme were 'accidentally broadcast over the new bulletin'. A spokeswoman said: 'There was a technical mistake where sound effects being prepared in another studio for an unrelated item were accidentally broadcast over the news bulletin.

"While millions of Brits swap sun hats for brollies today, this resourceful little frog was snapped sheltering from the rain - using a leaf as an UMBRELLA. Photographer Penkdix Palme, 27, caught the tiny tree frog sheltering from the rain in his neighbour's back garden. The aqua-phobic amphibian clung on to the stem of the green leaf for an impressive 30 minutes as it was lashed by wind and rain. This tiny little frog was snapped clinging to a leaf to shelter from the rain in a downpour in Jember, East Java, Indonesia . In this fascinating series of photographs, the two-inch high frog appears to angle the makeshift umbrella towards the direction of the downpour. Large droplets of water gather at the bottom of the leaf and surrounding branch while the clever frog remains protected. Penkdix, who only took up photography six months ago, said he was shocked when he stumbled upon the unusual scene in his hometown of Jember, East Java, Indonesia. The clever little amphibian clung to its 'umbrella' leaf for 30 minutes as the rain fell all around him . He avoided taking a battering by the rain drops, which instead collected on the leaf above him .

"A radical new kind of airship funded by the US military is about to make its first test flight - and it looks uncannily like the Thunderbird 2 craft from the classic TV show. The Aeroscraft airship will carry three times as much as the biggest military cargo planes over thousands of miles, use a third of the fuel, and it doesn't even need a landing strip. It could also have major implications for cargo haulage, and almost everything now laboriously transported across the planet's surface by boat, train and lorry could within years be carried through the skies, its makers claim. International rescue: The silver-skinned Aeroscraft prototype sits in its hangar, where green light reflecting from it makes it look uncannily like Thunderbird Two . A concept of the airship on the battlefield, where it could be used to transport tanks and soldiers directly onto the front line . The radical design has been likened to that of Thunderbird 2 . California-based aviation firm Aeros, with heavy backing from the U.S. military, has been developing their revolutionary Aeroscraft for several years, and they say the airship is now in its final stages. They have built a prototype which they hope will finally prove the concept works in practice and allow them to fine tune their systems. At 77m (250ft) in length, it is just half the size of the final model, but has been built with the same rigid structure, flight control systems and landing gear. Now all that needs to be done is for it to demonstrate the vertical take-off and landing that will make possible the point-to-point delivery features that will make it perfect for the commercial market. The finished version of the Aeroscraft - expected to be ready in three years - will carry a payload of 66 tons at a speed of 120 knots, upto 18,000ft with a range of 3000 nautical miles. That could revolutionise air transport, opening up remote areas where there is practically no other means of access. It could carry relief supplies for victims in disaster areas, heavy oil-extraction equipment to northern Canada's tar sands, huge turbines to remote wind farms and, of course, heavy military equipment to battlefields worldwide. Fill 'er up: At 77m (250ft) in length, the prototype Aeroscraft is just half the size of the final model, but has been built with the same rigid structure, flight control systems and landing gear . The 'skeleton' of the airship being built in California . The key breakthrough has been the development of an internal system for managing ballast. Previous airships have been held back by the need to weigh them down or tie them up while cargo is unloaded, lest they are suddenly carried away on the breeze. But the Aeroscraft's internal ballast management system gives its operators the ability to control the aircraft's buoyancy by compressing the helium inside its tanks to make it heavier than air and bring down to the ground. Once cargo has been loaded, the airship can rise by re-releasing the compressed helium into its containment tanks, making it again lighter than air, then using turbo-prop engines to control its diretion. Because of this revolutionary system, Aeroscraft needs no airfield to operate, only a cleared area large enough for it to vertically take off and land, and enough labour on hand to unload the cargo. Limited: Conventional airships are held back by the need for infrastructure that can enable ground crews to fill them with ballast as they are unloaded to stop them from floating away on the breeze . Internal ballast: The Aeroscraft, by contrast, is able to control its buoyancy using an internal ballast management system which means it can land anywhere that there is space to touch down . Aeros's founder and CEO Igor Pasternak, 48, told Gizmag: 'The advantage is you don’t need ground infrastructure. You can fly anywhere, you can land anywhere, you don’t need any ballast, you don’t need any ground crew.' The airship has long been known as a 'dream machine' for visionary inventors. Count Ferdinand Graf von Zeppelin built the first airship in 1900 as a weapon for Germany. The 'Graf Zeppelin' was developed by Dr Hugo Eckener, who flew it around the world in 21 days in 1929. This powerful symbol of German might was adopted by the Nazis, who funded the creation of the largest airship yet, the Hindenburg. However, on May 6, 1937, the Hindenburg burst into flames on a trip to the US, having been filled with patriotic German hydrogen instead of American helium. But Ukrainian-born Mr Pasternak says that his design for a rigid airship is miles apart from the disastrous versions of the early 20th Century. He told Gizmag: 'From the structure stand point, all of us are familiar with the Hindenburg and Zeppelin designs. 'This is different. We built a space frame that sits inside of the vehicle and around the frame we built a rigid cell. The function of the rigid cell is to have it work with the aerodynamic laws. It’s a very simple approach. 'It also allows us to build vehicles very rapidly. When you’re talking about the production of vehicles, you need the ability to build number of them in a short term and with the frames you can do this.' The future: An artist's impression shows how the Aeroscraft might look as it picks up cargo from a distribution centre. Finished models will carry 66 tons over a distance of 3,000 nautical miles at 120 knots . The ship could also be used for major construction projects such as building large pipes, as it does not require a runway to land . The U.S. military has been a key player in the development of the Aeroscraft, with the Pentagon and Nasa giving Aeros a total of $36million towards its research. 'Without the initial funding of the Ministry of Defence it would not be possible to bring such a project to roll,' Mr Pasternak told FT Deutschland. Accordingly, the first operational versions have already been earmarked for 'intra-theatre airlift', Defense Transportation Journal reports, with each carrying the payload of three C-130 transport planes, but with the fuel cost of just one.","The Aeroscraft can carry three times more than the biggest military cargo planes over thousands of miles .

"Homeowners are being routinely duped into handing over thousands of pounds in hidden fees to estate agents, it has emerged. An investigation by the HomeOwners Alliance raises fears that firms are rushing to cash in on house prices rising at their fastest rate since the financial crisis in 2007. Over the last 12 months they jumped by 7.9 per cent, the Halifax said yesterday. February alone saw prices rise by £4,136 – equal to £147 every day – to an average of £179,872. Dubious practices: Estate agents rushing to cash in on the housing boom are routinely duping homeowners into handing over thousands of pounds in hidden fees, it has emerged . The investigation by the Alliance, which champions the interests of homeowners, revealed evidence of dubious practices in one in six telephone calls to estate agents. These included hidden charges of up to £500 for items such as marketing fees, registration charges and prime listings on property search engines. Some firms locked sellers into contracts of up to five months even if the property did not receive any interest. Others demanded sellers pay the estate agent at least £1,500 commission if a deal collapsed because a buyer pulled out. One agent was collecting a fee from both the seller and the buyer, when usually only the seller pays. Paula Higgins, chief executive of the HomeOwners Alliance, said: ‘Estate agents are handling the biggest transactions in most people’s lives, yet they can’t give a clear upfront answer to the questions “What are your fees and how much will you cost me?”.’ Only 2 per cent of the 49 firms questioned published their fees and commission rates on their websites. Sly: Hidden charges of up to £500 are being made for items such as marketing fees, registration charges and prime listings on property search engines . One in three agents refused to give even an indication of fees, which can be up to 2.5 per cent of the sale price, when prospective sellers first contacted them by phone. Britain has 500,000 estate agents who are not required to hold any formal qualifications. Mark Hayward, of the National Association of Estate Agents, said: ‘It is disappointing to hear of these practices. While they are the exception and not the norm, we have long called for better regulation of the industry to prevent any unfair or unclear fees.’ ÷ Stamp duty distorts the market by taxing buyers a disproportionate amount for going £1 over pre-set thresholds, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors says. It wants a graded system which would work like income tax, abolishing the thresholds’ harsh effect.","House prices now rising at fastest rate since the financial crisis in 2007 .

"A Thalidomide victim who is blind in one eye, partially deaf and can barely walk is being stripped of welfare payments - because officials say she is not 'disabled' enough to be out of work. Martine White, 50, was left severely disabled after her mother took the anti-sickness drug while pregnant with her during the 1960s. She can barely dress herself or even brush her hair, uses a wheelchair and will undergo spinal surgery later this year. Disabilities: Thalidomide victim Martine White of Burnley, Lancashire is blind in one eye, partially deaf and can barely walk. She has had benefits taken away because welfare officials say she is fit enough to work . Mrs White and her late husband Michael (pictured on their wedding day, right) were believed to be the first Thalidomide victims in Britain to get married. She now needs a carer to help her carry out simple tasks . But despite her disabilities the . Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) has written to Mrs White saying . she will lose her her £110 a week Employment and Support Allowance as . she cannot prove she is unfit to work. The former care assistant from . Burnley, Lancashire, has now been served with court papers and must . attend a tribunal where she will have to prove her disabilities to a . judge. In a report a DWP . inspector said: 'She is not entitled to the support component on the . grounds that she does not have limited capability for work related . activity.' Today Mrs White, . a widow who pays the mortgage on her adapted house herself plus council . tax,  said: 'Visually you only need to take one look at me to know . there is no chance I can possibly go to work. 'If I was to get a job I would need my . carer to go with me full time. I need to be aided even to go to the . toilet and I don't think a prospective employer would even employ me . knowing that I had to have a carer with me. Happier times: Mrs White on her Wedding day with her late husband Michael in 1980. As well as her other disabilities, she has also undergone brain surgery and will undergo spinal surgery later this year . Help: She needs a special lift to get up and down the stairs of her property because of her disabilities . 'I have been having a lot of . accidents lately and I keep falling over because I am unstable on my . feet and go dizzy quickly,' she said. 'I wouldn't be fit or safe to work. I have to . have someone to get me up in the morning and help get me dressed.' Mrs White, who needs a wheelchair to . get around, has to use a stair lift, while her carer helps her make tea . and brushes her hair. 'Because . of my Thalidomide, like so many others, I have arthritis,' she said. 'It is . because of the way I have had to manipulate my body over the years in . order to try and live a normal life.' 'What . anyone else finds a normal chore has killed us because we have had to . use our bodies in a different way. I'm sure the judge will take one look . at me and say 'why are you here?'' Fears: Mrs White with her son Carl, one of her four children. She says she does not want to rely on her family for help . Mrs White was one of 10,000 children . born with disfigurements after the thalidomide anti-sickness drug was . given to pregnant women in the 1950s and 1960s. She married her late husband Michael . who was also a Thalidomide victim in 1981 - the first Thalidomide couple . to be married in Britain. In 2004 she underwent surgery to remove a . brain tumour and retired from her job as a result. She now requires a carer seven days a . week, needs a lift to help her up the stairs and is permanently on . medication to help relieve  constant pain. Trouble with her benefits . began last year after Mrs White received a letter notifying her of a . changeover from incapacity benefits to Employment and Support Allowance. Just a few weeks later, in July, she . received another letter saying she was no longer entitled to benefits . and she must go on a work training course. The family appealed and the . decision was overturned. But last October she was re-contacted . by the DWP and told once again she should not be claiming benefits. A . further appeal was rejected, although she can still continue claiming £154 a week . in Disability Living Allowance. Mrs White, who has four children and . five grandchildren, added: 'I can't sit for a long time because it is . uncomfortable. I am blind in one eye, I have an artificial hip and I am . waiting for spinal surgery. I am unsteady with my balance and I am deaf . in both ears and need hearing aids. 'It . is like no one has looked at these medical reports from my past - I . even have a full adapted automatic car which you can only get on . mobility. I have no teeth either because I have had to open things . with my teeth. 'I have . also got arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis - you name it. As a . Thalidomide [victim] we have to use our bodies in a different way and this has . set in.' Mrs White said she cannot sit for a . long period of time so would be no good in the office and cannot hear properly so a job in . telecommunications would be 'out of the question.' Mrs White said was 'disgusted' by the DWP's decision and labelled its officers 'jobsworths.' 'If the . support is taken away from my full-time carers I would have to rely on . family,' she said. 'I have three boys and a girl. I can't ask the boys to help me . shower - it is undignified,' she said. Fighting the decision: A letter from HM Courts & Tribunals Service confirming Mrs White's appeal . Her son Carl White, a joiner, 32, said: 'This country has too much red tape and not enough common sense. The DWP are just idiots - I just can't . understand what they are doing. It's an insult.' A DWP spokesman said: 'The old incapacity benefits system condemned too . many people to a life on benefits with little hope of moving back to . work. Now people who can work will be given help to find a job while those who need unconditional support will get it. 'A decision on whether someone is well enough to work is taken after . consideration of all the supporting medical evidence provided by the . claimant, but everybody has the right to appeal a decision if they . disagree with it.' The Government's crackdown on disability benefits will accelerate in April, when Disability Living Allowance will gradually be . replaced by the Personal Independence Payment (PIP), which is being . introduced in an attempt to cut the nation’s benefits bill. To get the PIP, people must have a face-to-face assessment, rather than simply filling out a form. In the past decade, the number of people receiving DLA has soared by more than a third, from 2.4million to 3.3million. The cost to the taxpayer is now £13billion a year. An astonishing seven out of ten claimants – 71 per cent – have been offered the benefit for life without any checks to see if they still need it, according to the Department for Work and Pensions.","Martine White, 50, needs help to perform simple domestic tasks .

"They were written to teach children colours and strange words but distorted versions of bouncy Sesame Street songs have been used to torture Guantanamo Bay prisons for days, it has been claimed. The staggering assertion has been made in a documentary from Al Jazeera and follows previous claims in 2008 that heavier tunes such as Metallica’s ‘Enter Sandman’ and Drowning Pool’s ‘Bodies’ were played incessantly to prisoners at the naval base in Cuba.

Christopher Cerf, the man behind the distinctive Sesame Street theme tune and a further 200 songs used in the show over the years, says he was shocked to discover that his music which was intended for good was used as a form of torture. Speaking in the film he says: ‘'My first reaction was ‘this can't possibly be true, this is just too crazy’ it was just absurd.’’ ‘I didn't really like the idea that I was helping to break down prisoners, but it was much worse when I heard later that they were actually using the music in Guantanamo to do deep interrogations to inflict long-term pain on prisoners so that they would talk.’ Painful note: Big Bird performs a song with youngsters on Sesame Street.

The 41-year-old man was held in the car park of an Asda supermarket near Manchester City's Etihad Stadium after reports of a drone flying over a stand during Saturday's match against Tottenham Hotspur. The man, from the Nottingham area, was arrested on suspicion of breaching the air navigation order and bailed for two months while police make further inquiries. A 41-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of flying a drone over Manchester City's win vs Tottenham . The incident happened on Saturday as City (left) hosted Tottenham in the early Premier League kick-off . Sergio Aguero (right) scored all four goals in City's thumping 4-1 victory against Spurs . Greater Manchester Police released a photograph of the small white drone. It was not clear what it was used for. Chief Inspector Chris Hill said: 'The drones could pose a threat to crowd safety and potentially cause alarm in crowded areas. 'Even small drones can weigh up to seven or eight kilograms and could cause damage or injury if they fall from height. Thankfully, no one was hurt. 'People may see this as a minor offence but it is a breach of the Air Navigation Order which is prosecuted by the Civil Aviation Authority.' A drone carrying the contentious issue of Kosovo was flown during Serbia's Euro 2016 qualifier vs Albania . Serbia player Stefan Mitrovic pulled the drone down which led to nasty scenes in Belgrade last week . More than 45,000 people attended the Premier League match, which Manchester City won 4-1. It comes just a week after a drone carrying a contentious banner caused Serbia's Euro 2016 qualifier with Albania to be abandoned. Operating rules for drones - also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) - state that they must never be flown beyond the normal, unaided line of sight of their operator. UAVs fitted with cameras must always be flown at least 50 metres away from a person, vehicle, building or structure. They must not be flown within 150 metres of a congested area or large group of people, such as a sporting event or concert. Mitrovic's actions led to a mass brawl between players and fans as the game had to be abandoned . The Civil Aviation Authority has concluded two cases involving a breach of rules on drone flights this year. In April, a man became the first person in the UK to be successfully prosecuted for dangerous and illegal flying of an unmanned aircraft. He was fined £800 after flying a device in restricted airspace over a nuclear submarine facility. In May, another man was fined £300 after he was accused of flying a quadcopter device over a number of rides at theme park Alton Towers in Staffordshire. The incidents took place in August and November last year respectively. Magistrates can fine culprits up to £5,000.","City beat Tottenham 4-1 in Saturday's early Premier League kick-off .

"Her name is Wounda, but her name says it all. In the Congo it means 'close to dying' - and that is exactly how she was found when she was taken in by the Jane Goodall Institute's Tchimpounga Chimpanzee Rehabilitation Center in the Republic of Congo. And when she was finally released after being nursed back to health, she repaid the kindness by hugging the well-known animal activist as realised she was free again. In the time since Wounda was found, it has taken years of care and dedication to nurse her back to health, until finally she was strong enough to be released into the outdoors once again. Scroll down for video... Never forget: Wounda hugs her caregiver and rescuer Dr. Jane Goodall on an island in the Congo . Special bond: The love felt by Wounda towards Dr. Goodall is clear to see as she is released into the wild . Can we have a moment? The image is both touching and tender as the two hug for a final time . So long! Dr Jane Goodall watches as Wounda begins to explore the island sanctuary and take in her new found freedom . Suffering from a number of illnesses and losing weight fast, it was a race against time to help save her life. Each morning, Wounda received a liter of milk. The caregivers at the center saw that she was recovering and making good progress. Eventually, the day came when it was time for her to live her life free from human interference. She was put into a crate and driven to her new home - a sanctuary site on Tchindzoulou Island in the nearby Kouilou River, the country’s second biggest river after the enormous Congo. The waters were calm and dark.  Dr. Rebeca Atencia, head of the Jane Goodall Institute-Congo, kept a careful eye on Wounda inside her box. Video courtesy of Jane Goodall Institute/Fernando Turmo. Watch the full video here. Touch me: Wounda prods her fingers through the slits in the wooden box . The journey beging: Wounda is placed into a box and loaded on the back of a pick-up truck for her journey to the santuary. You can see Wounda's fingers coming through the slits . It has been 20 years since the Tchimpounga Chimpanzee Rehabilitation Center opened in the Republic of Congo. Dr. Jane Goodall founded the sanctuary to provide care and hope to the . chimpanzee victims of the illegal commercial bushmeat and pet trades. Today, . many of the chimpanzee residents are adults who need to explore and . expand their horizons beyond the boundaries of the existing facility. Recognizing . this need, the Jane Goodall Institute put a great deal of effort into . creating a more natural environment for the Tchimpounga chimpanzees. It is to this new island sanctuary that Wounda was taken. New home: Through dense, lush vegetation, Wounda is carried onto the island . River wild: The sanctuary is on an island on Tchindzoulou Island in the nearby Kouilou River . Sailing: The JGI Congo team and Jane Goodall transport chimpanzee Wounda on the Kouilou River for her release on Tchindzoulou Island . The Jane Goodall Institute was provided the use of Tchindzoulou island by the Congolese government to help create new space for chimpanzees. The island is more wild than the enclosures at the sanctuary proper and the chimpanzees still have access to the care of staff. They even have facilities such as a dormitory that gives them a safe place to spend the night. The journey involved traveling by road on the back of a pick-up and then after 20 minutes of sailing down the river, the group reach a magical wild place: an island composed of hundreds of hectares of pristine and mysterious tropical forest surrounded by river water. During her journey, Wounda reaches in through the wooden slits in her box. Dr. Goodall places her hand on top of Wounda. Soon, it is time to let the chimp go. Dr Jane Goodall: It's a proud moment for Dr. Goodall as she tells the story of how Wounda a female chimpanzee has been reintroduced in the wild on the island of Tchindzoulou after staying at Tchimpounga sanctuary when she was rescued . Baby steps: Wounda takes her first step out into the lush green vegetation of the Congo jungle . King of the jungle: Wounda sits on top of the box she was transported in and takes a look around . One hug says it all: Wounda embraces Dr Goodall in a heartfelt moment of thanks and love . Wounded: Wounda was living up to her name when she was found a couple of years ago. She was desperately ill and close to dying . Step by step: Wounda was nursed back to health by a team of caregivers at the Jane Goodall Institute in the Congo . The long road to recovery: Dr Jane Goodall and Dr. Rebeca Atencia (right) discuss what the future holds for Wounda . 'This is a really exciting moment for me,' Ms Goodall says to the camera. 'Wounda nearly died but thanks to Dr. Rebeca Atencia she came back from the dead. Now she has a will to live and is about to come into paradise and became the 15th chimp to be released here.' The dense forest of Tchindzoulou Island is now home to 15 chimpanzees transferred from the original Tchimpounga sanctuary site over the last eighteen months. Life has changed dramatically for these chimps. Today, they can roam freely, feeling the wet earth under their feet, smelling the scents from the lush vegetation and listen to the island’s mysterious sounds while they explore their new surroundings. On the island, there are a variety of trees that offer the chimpanzees large quantities of fresh, ripe fruit. To get to the fruit, the chimps often have to climb to great heights, which is a perfect workout for their muscles and brains as they balance on unstable branches. One day, the aim is for some of the chimpanzees to be released in Conkouati-Douli National Park in northern Congo. We've come a long long way togetherL In 2012 Wounda was gravely ill. She was nursed back to health at the JGI Tchimpounga Chimpanzee Rehabilitation Center . Go forth and prosper! Jane Goodall and Rebeca Atencia watch orphan chimpanzee Wounda after her release on Tchindzoulou Island . Lazy Days: Wounda relaxes with friends on Tchindzoulou Island a month after her release . As the door to Wounda's box is opened, she scampers around but stays close to her human caregivers. She stands on top of her box and sits down to take in her new surroundings. Then, without thinking, she turns and hugs Dr. Goodall in a moving moment of tenderness between human and chimpanzee. The embrace between the two appears to last for several minutes. No words are spoken but it seems clear what both are feeling. Slowly and cautiously, Wounda wonders into the new undergrowth that lays before her. Dr. Goodall follows her a little way as she watched Wounda munch on the fresh green grass. The delight on her face is clear to see. Then, without so much of a look back, Wounda heads off into her new life on Tchindzoulou Island.","Video documents the story of Wounda, one of the more than 160 chimpanzees living at the Jane Goodall Institute in the Republic of Congo .

"Since he took a chunk out of Michael Bloomberg's finger in 2009, clairvoyant groundhog Chuck has never had the smoothest relationships with New York mayors. But now mayor-groundhog tensions appear to have taken an even more sinister turn, after it was revealed that  Bill de Blasio could well be responsible for the animal's death. In February this year, current mayor Mr de Blasio dropped the Staten Island groundhog in front of a crowd of spectators after the animal predicted six more miserable weeks of winter. Scroll down for video . Sources have suggested that New York mayor could be responsible for the death of groundhog Chuck . In February this year, current mayor Mr de Blasio dropped the Staten Island groundhog in front of a crowd of spectators after the animal predicted six more miserable weeks of winter . But what Staten Island Zoo officials kept rather quiet was that just a week after the incident, Chuck died of internal injuries. According to the New York Post, the zoo - which gets nearly half of its $3.5 million in annual funding from the city - told the staff to keep the mayor's office in the dark about the groundhog's sad death. In a further twist, it appears that Chuck was not in fact Chuck at all, but was actually a female imposter named Charlotte, sources told the newspaper yesterday. It is thought that Charlotte was brought in as an emergency measure because the zoo feared the volatile Chuck would bite Mayor de Blasio, as he did Mayor Bloomberg five years ago. The plot thickens as it appears that Chuck could in fact be stand-in groundhog Charlotte . The zoo does not make public that it has stand-in groundhogs to protect the 'groundhog brand,' insiders said. The female stand-in was found dead in her enclosure at the Staten Island Zoo on February 9 and a necropsy determined she died from 'acute internal injuries,' sources said. She had fallen nearly six feet when the mayor lost his grip during the Groundhog Day photo-op exactly seven days earlier. Sources said her injuries were consistent with a fall. 'Chuck and my predecessor didn’t always get along, let’s be honest about that. But I’m hoping we can start a new day, a new relationship here,' Mr de Blasio joked at the time. 'I’m reaching out a hand to chuck and I hope he will consider shaking it rather than doing other things.' But the mayor had no such luck and the animal wriggled from his hands and leapt to the ground . 'Now Chuck, what about this winter thing, Chuck? We can work something out, can’t we?' the mayor added. A zoo spokesperson tried to downplay the mayor's role in Chuck/Charlotte's death, saying the animal was examined after the fall and seemed fine. 'It appears unlikely that the animal's death is related to the events on Groundhog Day,' the spokesperson said . Bill de Blasio was hoping to forge a better relationship with groundhog Chuck than his predecessor . Groundhog handler John Griffiths holds up Punxsutawney Phil. The furry rodent is one of a small group of groundhogs said to forecast the weather, including Chuck in Staten Island . Assemblyman Matthew Titone told the New York Post: 'I was told he died of old age, that he went to that big farm in the sky.' The mayor's office only heard the news of the groundhog's death when approached by the paper. 'We were unaware that Staten Island Chuck had passed but are sorry to hear of the loss,' said spokesman Phil Walzak. According to zoo sources, there are plans to pull the same groundhog switch next year by using the groundhog couple's young daughter - also named Charlotte - in the role of Chuck. Punxsutawney Phil is held by Ron Ploucha after emerging from his burrow. Legend has it that if the animal sees his shadow, winter will last another month-and-a-half. If he doesn't see it, spring will come early . Chuck/Charlotte is one of a small group of groundhogs said to forecast the weather, the most famous being Pennsylvania's Punxsutawney Phil. Legend has it that if the furry rodent sees his shadow on February 2, winter will last another month-and-a-half. If he doesn't see it, spring will come early. The annual event - made world famous by the 1993 Bill Murray comedy 'Groundhog Day' - draws thousands of tourists from as far afield as Australia and Russia. A version of Punxsutawney Phil has been making weather predictions since 1887, but since the release of the popular movie crowds of up to 30,000 have made their way to Pennsylvania to witness the ceremony. Groundhog handler Ben Hughes holds Punxsutawney Phil in February this year at the annual  celebrations .","Bill de Blasio dropped Staen Island groundhog Chuck in February .

"The family of a 15-year-old honors student who was gunned down in Chicago just a week after she performed at Obama's inaugural events have sobbed as they pleaded with the public to find her killer. Hadiya Pendleton had been let out early from school on Tuesday after an exam and was . huddling under a canopy in a South Side park to escape the rain when she . was shot in the back. A . witness said around 10 students in the park scattered when a man opened . fire. Hadiya and another teen collapsed a block away in front of one of . the upscale homes lining . Oakenwalk Avenue. 'It's very painful to see your big sister get slaughtered,' ten-year-old Nathaniel Pendleton Jr. told the Chicago Tribune about Hadiya's death, as tributes flooded in for the popular star student. Sorrow: Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy offers the city's condolences to the Pendelton family, Nathaniel Jr., Nathaniel Sr., and Cleopatra during a news conference seeking help from the public . 'I'm not worried about where she is . going, but I miss her,' his father Nate Sr. added. 'A whole . section of my heart is gone. Get the guns out of the hands of people that don't need to have them.' The grieving family, including Hadiya's mother Cleopatra, wiped away tears at a news conference in which Chicago Police . Superintendent Garry McCarthy appealed for any information. Police said gang members were at the park where Hadiya was killed but she was not a gang member. Instead, they believe she was an 'unintended target' when the gunman ran to the park and opened fire at 2.20 p.m. He then jumped into a waiting car and drove away, police said. 'As . usual, the bad guy aims, but he never hits the other bad guy. He hits . the one that hurts the most to lose,' Chicago Police Officer and . attorney Damon Stewart, 36, Hadiya's godfather, told Fox32. Heartbreak: Father Michael Pfleger , left, consoles Cleopatra Pendelton during the news conference . Pain: Cleopatra Pendelton, left, is consoled by her sister Kimiko Pettis, the day after her daughter was killed . Another student from her school was shot . in the leg and is in serious condition in hospital. He has been . identified by friends as 17-year-old Lawrence Sellers, DNAinfo reported. The tragedy comes days after Obama, . whose Chicago home is only a mile from the murder scene, announced plans . to ban assault weapons as part of a drastic overhaul of gun laws. As more details of Hadiya's death emerged, former Arizona Democrat Gabrielle Giffords, who herself survived being shot at point-blank range in 2011, spoke determinedly  at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on how to curb gun violence on Wednesday. The . battle for gun control comes after Chicago endured its most deadly . January for ten years, with Hadiya's death bringing the total killings . in the city since the start of the year to 42. Tragic: Hadiya Pendleton, 15, was shot dead as she stood in a Chicago park with friends on Tuesday. It comes a week after she performed as part of her school band (pictured left in uniform) at Obama's inauguration . Missed: Hadiya with a friend in Washington D.C. last week after she performed at inaugural event . The shooting occurred just a few blocks from the teenagers' elite school, . King College Prep, and a mile from the president's lavish Chicago home on Greenwood Avenue. 'The school is good but the neighborhood . is not,' student Anta Nije told Fox. 'When we step outside the school, . anything can happen to us.' In fact, relatives said Hadiya's mother was intending to move away to ensure her daughter's safety and a good education. 'Believe . it or not, her mom was just looking to move to Naperville,' Hadiya's . cousin, Shatira Wilks, said. 'Her mom wanted her to take her kids to an . even better community and make sure her education is number one. Her . daughter has never ever given her mother a problem, this girl was . literally a walking angel.' Performance: The King College Prep band is pictured in D.C. Hadiya also performed with the drill team . Loved: Hadiya is pictured (third from left) with her fellow Majorettes teammates at the elite school . Top student: One friend uploaded this photo of Hadiya taking part in the school band and drill team . Hadiya's death brings Chicago homicides this month to 42 - making it the most deadly January in Chicago in 10 years. The last time there were as many murders was in January 2002, when there were 45. It also comes after there were more than 500 killings in the city in 2012. This weekend, a Chicago mother lost her fourth child to gun crime. Shirley Chambers had previously lost two sons and a daughter in shootings stretching back 18 years, but on Saturday her only surviving child, Ronnie Chambers, was shot in the head while sitting in a parked car in the west side of the city. While there are strict gun laws in the state and city, police are finding more weapons on the streets of Chicago than much larger cities. They seized 7,400 guns in crimes or unpermitted uses in Chicago last year, compared with 3,285 in New York City, the New York Times reported. Authorities have confiscated 574 guns since the start of the year - 124 of them last week alone. Hadiya, a sophomore at King's, had attended the inauguration and performed at inaugural events with the school band and the Majorettes dance team, the Tribune reported. Friends added that she was a volleyball player for the school and well-liked - and even had plans to go on a French-exchange program. 'She was working on some sort of exchange program, where she was going to go to school in Paris,' her godfather said. 'She was a great student.' Hadiya had aspirations to become a pharmacist or a journalist and had interest in attending Northwestern University, relatives told the Tribune. 'There were a lot of good opportunities that were coming her way. She was just taking them all,' Lakeisha Stewart, 37, Hadiya's godmother said. 'She was the kid who you had to say, 'Slow down, you can’t do everything"". 'I've known this little girl her . entire life. I can't think of a moment that this child did anything . wrong. She always strived to do the right thing.' Her cousin added: 'She's a huge reader, loves stories and . novels and was naturally smart, always on the honor roll. She was caught up in the violence of the city.' Fellow student Janai Bates, 17, said she didn't know of anyone who had any problems with either of the victims. Scene: She was at this South Side park with friends when a man ran towards them and opened fire . Location: The shooting took place just a mile from the Chicago home of President Obama . 'Lawrence and Hadiya aren’t the type of people to get in a conflict with . anybody,' she said. 'Everybody loved them, they joked with everybody, . they give out that warmth.' Students wore red to school in remembrance and were pictured taking part in a prayer circle. Police confirmed she had no arrest history and 'by all indications the female victim was an unintended target'. But their statement added: 'Preliminary information indicates that most of the members of the group were gang members.' Loss: Hadiya, pictured, died an hour later, while the other teenage victim remains in hospital . Popular: Friends said that the talented student was well-liked at school and 'gave out warmth' Teenagers at the park were not . cooperating . with police on Tuesday night and investigators do not have any detailed . descriptions of the attacker or his vehicle, the Tribune reported. As of Tuesday evening, no one was in police custody in connection with the shooting. Roxane Hubbard, who has lived in the neighbourhood for 19 years, told DNAinfo she has never heard of a shooting on her block. 'President Obama's house is like three blocks from here, so this is not typical,' she said. Students . in the marching band from the school went to Washington, D.C., to take . part in the Presidential Inauguration Heritage Music Festival. Remembrance: Fellow students wore red and formed a prayer circle for Hadiya on Wednesday . They also performed at a presidential brunch and at a political event at Howard University, ABC30 reported. The drill team also performed and 200 students from the school attended in total. When asked about Hadiya's death, presidential spokexman Jay Carney called it a 'terrible tragedy' for someone to be killed when they had 'so much of their life ahead of them'. 'The president and first lady's thoughts and prayers are with the family of Hadiya Pendleton,' he said. 'All of our thoughts and prayers are with her family.' Curbing gun violence across the city has been a major priority for Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Obama's former chief of staff. On Wednesday, he became emotional as he paid tribute to the murdered teenager. Grief: A photograph on Twitter shows photos, notes and toys placed by the teenager's locker . 'She is what is best in our city,' he said. 'A child going to school, who takes a final exam, who had just been to the inaugural.'You look at her, you look at how she talked about her future. She took her final exams. She had dreams. And this gang-banger, this punk took that away from Cleopatra. They took it away from Hadiya. And in my view, they took it away from the city of Chicago.' He added: 'If anybody has any information, you are not a snitch. You’re a citizen.' The city's police superintendent . Garry McCarthy also spoke out about violence in the city on Tuesday after returning from a meeting with the . president in Washington. He said he discussed the . 'reasonableness' of gun laws as he met Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, . Attorney General Eric Holder and Department of Homeland Security . Secretary Janet Napolitano. 'There seems to be a consensus now . among law enforcement, and as this consensus among Americans that the . reason ability of the gun laws has to be examined,' McCarthy said.

"A multi-millionaire tech-entrepreneur, who was once named one of America’s ‘most eligible bachelors’, has avoided jail time despite allegedly beating and kicking his girlfriend 117 times in a 30 minute attack. Gurbaksh Chahal, 31, was charged with 45 felony counts over the incident, which took place in his San Francisco apartment in August last year. Police obtained CCTV which allegedly show Chahal, who ironically describes himself as ‘die hard’, kicking his then-partner in the head multiple times and attempting to smother her. Scroll down for video . Multi-millionaire tech entrepreneur Gurbaksh Chahal - pictured on the balcony of his San Francisco penthouse  was allegedly filmed hitting and kicking his then-partner 117 times over half an hour last year. He has now filed a police report against another woman claiming she is obsessed and harassing him . Police were called to Chahal’s Infinity Towers penthouse apartment after a 911-call about domestic violence on August 5, 2013. Chahal, who made his millions through online advertising startups and currently heads $100million-a-year RadiumOne, is alleged to have threatened to kill his girlfriend several times, according to a police report. Chahal faced 45 felony charged and two misdemeanour charges based on the security footage San Francuisco police pulled from his bedroom. The 45 counts also included Assault With a Deadly Weapon (not a fire arm), which in this case is cited as a pillow. However, as the court case proceeded, a judge ruled the video inadmissible as the San Francisco Police Department had obtained it without a warrant. Chahal’s girlfriend also withdrew her testimony and refused to cooperate . Chahal - pictured with President Obama - pleaded guilty to one charge of domestic violence battery and one charge of battery and was sentenced to just 25 hours of community service, three years probation and a 52-week domestic violence training course after beating his girlfriend in 2013 . Eligible bachelor? Police were called to Chahal's penthouse after a 911-call about domestic violence on August 5, 2013, which later saw him face 45 felony charges based on the CCTV footage taken by cameras in his bedroom . In the end, on April 16, Chahal pleaded guilty to one charge of domestic violence battery and one charge of battery and was sentenced to just 25 hours of community service, three years’ probation and a 52-week domestic violence training course. Despite the incident in August, the recent court case and guilty plea, Chahal remains in charge of RadiumOne, working as a motivational speaker and lecturer and continues to publish 'inspirational posts' on his social media channels. These have recently included: '15 Things Leaders Never Do', 'If you’re looking for a role model. Don’t look outside, just look inside.' and 'When you want to succeed as bad you want to breathe, then you’ll be successful'. He allegedly smothered his girlfriend for 20 seconds. ‘She stated she was unable to breathe,’ San Francisco Police Officer Anh Nguyen, told the court during a preliminary hearing last month, San Francisco Business Times reports. 'She stated that he said, “I’m going to kill you” four times. She stated she was in fear for her life.’ Still in charge: Despite the court case and guilty plea, Gurbaksh Chahal, pictured with two promo girls at a bachelor party, has remained Chairman and CEO of RadiumOne, a company valued at more than $500million . Indian-born Chahal moved to California with his family when he was four and founded his first start-up in his bedroom after dropping out of high-school. Aged 18 he sold ClickAgents, an online company making revenue from performance-based advertising, for $40million. Four years later, he formed BlueLithium which was one of the first companies to track users online habits to tailor advertising - a system now found all over the internet. He sold id to Yahoo! in 2007 for $300million in cash. Chahal has also made numerous TV appearances, including a lengthy interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2009, a philanthropic stint on Secret Millionaire and was named America's most eligible bachelor by Extra TV five years ago. His autobiography, released at the age of 27, is called The Dream: How I Learned the Risks and Rewards of Entrepreneurship and Made Millions. The San Francisco District Attorney's Office, issued a statement after the guilty plea on Thursday which said: ‘We disagree with the judge’s suppression of the video. The judge’s ruling substantially weakened the evidence we had for prosecution. ‘Though it is not the outcome we had hoped for, the case has reached a resolution where the defendant acknowledges guilt, is placed on domestic violence probation and has to take domestic violence classes.’","Multi-millionaire Gurbaksh Chahal, 31, charged with 45 felony counts .

"'Shaman': Juliette D'Souza persuaded a woman to have an abortion by claiming the unborn child was evil and seriously deformed, a fraud trial has heard . A witch doctor persuaded a woman to have an abortion by claiming the unborn child was evil and seriously deformed, a fraud trial has heard. Juliette D’Souza pretended to be a shaman who could cure terminal illnesses and help women conceive babies, it was said. The phoney faith healer tricked the woman into parting with £170,000 after she became increasingly desperate to fall pregnant, the jury was told. The victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told Blackfriars Crown Court in London yesterday that she had been unable to conceive for three years. She was introduced to D’Souza in 2005. The witch doctor told the woman she had to start paying money to her to stop ‘terrible things’ from happening and to help her become pregnant. But when the woman unexpectedly became pregnant, D’Souza allegedly told her to have an abortion at a Marie Stopes Clinic because ‘the baby was evil’ and ‘he would be in real trouble’ if she gave birth. Breaking down in tears in the witness box, the woman said: ‘She told me that the baby was very deformed, ill and sick. She said that I should get rid of the baby. ‘I flew on the day it was terminated. I asked to be at the back of the plane because I just cried the whole way. I was in so much pain. It was just so awful, the whole thing.’ She said D’Souza, 59, was the ‘cruellest and most evil person’ she had ever met. Asked why she gave her so much money, the woman said: ‘Because I wanted to be a mother and I thought maybe this would change my whole life situation because it was not very good.’ Case: D'Souza pretended to be a shaman who could cure terminal illnesses and help women conceive babies, Blackfriars Crown Court (pictured) was told. She allegedly tricked the woman into parting with £170,000 . By the autumn of 2007 she began to suspect D’Souza’s act was a scam and told officers at Hampstead Police Station in North-West London. But officers ‘practically laughed in our faces’, she said. Eventually she broke into one of D’Souza’s rented properties in Hampstead and discovered a treasure trove of ‘voodoo black magic’ items, the court heard. These included drawings of an ‘evil eye’, burned photographs half buried in earth, seven freezers filled with rotting meat and a monkey in a cage on the first floor, it was alleged. D’Souza is accused of persuading 11 people to part with cash ‘sacrifices’ of £30,000 or £40,000 at a time. They believed the money was flown to Suriname in South America where it would be hung from a magical tree in the Amazon rainforest where it would solve whatever problems they faced. Instead, the money was allegedly used to fund a ‘lavish lifestyle’. D’Souza denies 23 charges of obtaining property by deception and fraud. The trial continues.

"Anti-Semitism is still prevalent in Germany with some 19 million adults harbouring negative sentiments towards Jews, according to a new study . Anti-Semitism remains prevalent around the world, with one in four adults expressing anti-Jewish sentiment, according to a new study. The Anti-Defamation League's Global 100 Index found someone to be anti-Semitic if they answered 'probably' or 'definitely' true to six or more of 11 stereotypes about Jews offered on the survey. The highest level of anti-Semitism was found in the Palestinian territories of West Bank and Gaza at 93 per cent. Greece . was the most anti-Semitic country in Western Europe, with 69 per cent of . the adults surveyed expressing such opinions. Meanwhile, Sweden, with 4 per cent, was the least. In the United States, 9 per cent of adults . were found to harbour anti-Semitic views; while the figure for the UK was 8 per cent. The study, which the ADL called 'the broadest survey of anti-Jewish attitudes ever conducted', found the lowest level of anti-Semitism in Laos, with just 0.2 percent of the adult population expressing such views. 'Our findings are sobering but sadly not surprising,' said ADL National Director Abraham Foxman. 'We can now identify hotspots, as well as countries and regions of the world where hatred of Jews is virtually non-existent.' Foxman said findings about Greece had already led to an invitation from that country's prime minister to discuss possible remedies. 'Jews are more loyal to Israel than to this country/to the countries they live in,' was the most commonly accepted stereotype with 41 per cent of respondents surveyed across 101 countries and the West Bank and Gaza saying that it was at least 'probably true'. The highest level of anti-Semitism was found in the Palestinian territories of West Bank and Gaza at 93 per cent . The second most accepted stereotype, held by 35 per cent of respondents, was: 'Jews have too much power in the business world.' The survey also found that only 54 per cent of those polled had heard about the Holocaust, a figure Foxman called 'disturbingly low'. West Bank and Gaza (93%) Iraq (92%) Yemen (88%) Algeria and Libya (both 87%) Tunisia (86%) Kuwait (82%) Bahrain and Jordan (both 81%) Morocco, Qatar and UAE (80%) Lebanon (78%) Oman (76%) New Zealand, Australia, Canada (all 14%) Czech Republic and Thailand (both 13%) Tanzania (12%) U.S. and Denmark (both 9%) UK (8%) Vietnam (6%) Netherlands (5%) Sweden (4%) Philippines (3%) Laos (0.2%) The Anti-Defamation League's Global 100 Index found someone to be anti-Semitic if they answered 'probably' or 'definitely' true to six or more of 11 stereotypes about Jews offered on the survey.

According to the survey, 49 per cent of Muslims hold anti-Semitic views compared with 24 per cent of Christians. But Jeffery Liszt, who oversaw the survey for Anzalone Liszt Grove Research, said that anti-Semitic views conformed more closely to region than religion with 75 per cent Muslims in the Middle East and North Africa holding anti-Semitic views while only 18 percent of Muslims in sub-Saharan Africa expressed similar sentiments. The Middle East and North Africa region was found to be the most anti-Semitic and the Oceania region the least, followed by the Americas. Anti-Semitic attitudes were relatively low in English speaking countries at 13 per cent compared with 30 per cent for Spanish-speaking countries, the report found. The survey also found that among the 74 per cent of those surveyed who said that they had never met a Jewish person, 25 per cent nonetheless harbored anti-Semitic attitudes. The survey interviewed 53,100 adults across 102 countries with funding from New York philanthropist Leonard Stern. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 0.97 percentage points for results across all nations surveyed and varies for results from individual nations. The survey also found that only 54 per cent of those polled had heard about the Holocaust.

"These dramatic images show a young lion fighting for his life after a two-hour battle with an older male. In the incredible series of pictures, the bloodied lion bares his teeth and raises its claws in an attempt to take on the older male in Cheetah Plains, South Africa. But the youngster's opponent is too strong for him - landing blow after blow with his enormous claws. Savage: A male lion stands on his back legs and shows his teeth during a vicious fight in Cheetah Plains, South Africa . Agression: The younger male, determined to put up a good fight, stands his ground and roars at his opponent . Pounce: The younger male, who is covered in blood and has numerous deep wounds to his chest, launches at the older lion . The two stand on their hind legs, almost like humans, and wrestle chest to chest. At one point, the young lion launches himself at his opponent - but his attack seems to have little benefit. Despite inflicting a series of deep wounds, the older male is unrelenting - and the newcomer appears to be moments from defeat. But just as the youngster prepares for one last stand, two females swoop in and come to his rescue. Keeping watch: Two females arrive but keep their distance just as the older male, right lands a heavy blow on his young opponent . The cavalry: The females from the young lion's pride begin to circle the fighting pair who continue to take swipes at one another . In on the action: The females edge closer to the action, and growl at the wrestling males . In need of a hand: The young male, looking tired and on the edge of defeat, cowers at his opponent stands tall . The female duo first circle the fighting pair, as if to assess the situation. Then one launches into the action, and swipes her claw at the youngster's opponent. At one point, the young lion and the two females stand in a row and all show their teeth during the dramatic showdown. Eventually, the two males calm down and the four seem to rest for just a moment. The male then walks off and takes a drink at a watering hole. Involved: One of the females strikes out at the older male, while the other appears to be moments from pouncing . Pick on someone your own size! The three lions outnumber the older male and roar at him in unison . The young male is part of a pride of two adult females, two sub-adult females and another sub-adult male. The lone male had been mating with the . two older females, but the area is surrounded by other male coalitions . - some six-strong - who could easily sweep him aside. Photographer Justin Glanvill described the action as 'spectacular'. He said: 'The sounds were overpowering and the pure aggression and the sustained onslaught from the older male was amazing to witness. 'But the amount of heart the young . male lion had was also unbelievable - he stood up to a much older and . stronger male and fought with all his might. 'There was lots of growling and snarling and then all hell broke loose. 'The . older male caught the young male and proceeded to hit him with a . barrage of shots. Then he had him on the ground where he inflicted more . damage to the young male's belly. Defeat: The trio force the male to stand down, although tensions still seem to be high . Calm: In a less frantic photo, the male looks at his young opponent as if to see if he is ok . 'The females then came to the rescue, attacking the older male.' However, Mr Glanvill, 29, believes that far from wanting to kill, the larger lion may have been trying to form a coalition. Mr Glanvill, a field guide at Cheetah Plains Private Game Reserve, in South Africa, added: 'Forming a coalition with the younger males would make sense, as otherwise he doesn't stand a chance.' But judging by these photographs the roaring younger male was driving a hard bargain and only time will tell if they will form a bond. It's all over: The older lion eventually walks off to a nearby watering hole and takes a drink after his fight .","Young lion takes on opponent, but is soon struggling for his life during savage fight in Cheetah Plains, South Africa .

"Prolific: Danny York owned up to 50 break-ins around Colchester, stealing £25,000 of property . A prolific burglar had a crisis of conscience in prison - and owned up to 50 break-ins. Danny York, 27, was given an extra jail terms of two years and five months after coming clean to officers about a seven year crime spree in Colchester, Essex. Police admitted they had no evidence linking him to the crimes, and said they would have remained unsolved without his confession. York stole £25,000 of property, mostly from garages, to fund his drug habit. He decided to come clean while he was already serving a nine-month sentence for three burglaries, Chelmsford Crown Court heard. He asked to see police and the result was officers solved another 48 break-ins plus two house burglaries and the theft of two expensive bikes from a garage. Judge Patrick O’Brien said: 'You seem to have taken a hard look at yourself and got rid of your drug habit and decided to wipe the slate clean.' The judge jailed him for a total of two years five months after he admitted two burglaries, a theft and asked for another 48 matters to be considered. Mark Lakin, prosecuting, told the court York, of no fixed address, was in jail when he decided to tell police what he had been doing. One burglary was traced back to May 2005 with the others carried out in Colchester over the next seven years, Mr Lakin said. Televisions, jewellery, laptops, phones and bikes were among the items taken to pay for his drugs, the court heard. Clare Ashcroft, mitigating, said: 'He wants to wipe the slate clean and make a fresh start. 'He’s now drug free and is making good use of his time in prison.' York’s sister Clare York, 23, said he is no longer part of the family but hopes he would stay true to his word to honour his mum, Tina York, who died in October. She said: “I hope one day he’ll sort himself and his life out for the sake of our mum who passed away in October. Confession: York was sentenced at Chelmsford Crown Court and later admitted a seven-year crime spree while in prison . 'But he has a long way to go before he is forgiven for the trouble he’s caused.' Police have admitted York’s crimes would have gone unsolved had it not been for his confession. Detective Constable Jim Finnigan said: 'I can confirm that if York had not made the decision to voluntarily engage with the police and take this bold step, these offences would have remained unsolved. We knew nothing, we had no evidence.' Detective Constable Finnigan said the confession would also provide reassurance to his victims, many of which were homeowners. He said: 'We are now going to be able to go back to these victims and we can offer them some reassurance that it wasn’t personal, they weren’t targeted, they weren’t watched - the majority of York’s offences were opportunist. The judge picked up on that.' He added: 'York was formerly a drug user. He now wishes to do all that he can to reassure that upon his release, he does so in the knowledge that he has been brought to justice for every crime he has ever committed and look forward to a crime-free life. 'He is also keen to demonstrate to his family this part of his life is completely behind him and is doing all he can to re-build their trust.'","Danny York, 27, came clean while already serving nine month sentence .

"Sore, watery, uncomfortable eyes can be hugely debilitating. One of the most common causes is dry eye syndrome – which affects nearly five million Britons over the age of 45 and, despite its name, actually leads to more tears. The condition can be triggered by everything from the weather to hormonal changes, and also can be a symptom of an underlying health problem. Here the experts reveal what could be causing your eye trouble – and explain the ways to tackle it... Hopeless: Sore and watery eyes can be an indication of dry eye syndrome . TEARS MATTER . When the eyes aren’t producing enough tears, or the tears evaporate too quickly, we are said to be suffering dry eye syndrome. Symptoms include sore, irritated eyes, blurred vision, the feeling of having something in your eye and the eyes becoming very watery. They can also become red, but not always. About 20 per cent of people in the UK suffer from dry eye syndrome, rising to 50 per cent in those over  65. Rosie Gavzey, an optometrist and trustee of The Eyecare Trust, explains: ‘As we get older the constitution of tears is just not quite  as strong so the eyes become dry.’ Hormonal changes associated with ageing can also take their toll on the quality of our tears, she says. ‘Some women find that when they hit the menopause they can no longer tolerate contact lenses. The same thing can happen when they take the pill or become pregnant.’ Surprisingly, sufferers of  dry eye syndrome often  find their eyes look watery, says Warwickshire-based optometrist Francesca Marchetti. ‘The eye is dry and so  it overproduces tears, but it doesn’t help because the tears don’t contain the right lubricants.’ Eye drops can help, and in the case of menopausal women, supplements such as evening primrose oil too. Blink and you'll miss it: Screen time, be it tablets, computers or televisions, can result in forgetting to blink - drying out your eyes . ARE YOU A BAD BLINKER? Regular blinking is crucial for healthy eyes, says Gavzey. ‘Every time you blink, you’re keeping your eyes refreshed and clearing the cornea, the transparent front part  of the eye.’ The problem is that when we’re concentrating on something, particularly a screen, we tend to forget to blink – meaning the eyes become dry. Studies have shown that on average, we blink about 22 times a minute, but when we concentrate on a computer screen or smartphone, or even while driving, the rate goes down to between five and seven blinks per minute. Many people also get into bad blinking habits, says Gavzey. ‘It’s a reflex action – but a good way to make sure your eyes stay fully lubricated is to blink slowly and deliberately every so often. ‘One way to check you’re doing it correctly is to hold the tips of your index fingers on the outer corners of the eyelids. You’ll notice that when you blink normally, your fingers will be pulled in. If you do it slowly and carefully – as if you are going to sleep – your fingers won’t move as much. It might feel quite unnatural at first.’ A study published in the journal Optometry And Vision Science found that reading from a smartphone can cause eye strain because the eyes have to point in the right direction as well as focus on the small text, meaning they have to work harder. Unnecessary: 'Eye brightening drops' are mostly a waste of time and could even give you allergies . When using a computer, smartphone or tablet for long periods, remember the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look up for 20 seconds at something at least 20ft away. Or here’s a tip from Ali Mearza, consultant ophthalmologist at Imperial NHS Trust: ‘Think of the Enter or Return key as a “blink’’ key. Every time you hit it, remember to blink.’ WINTER IS THE WORST SEASON FOR DRY EYES . Cold weather won’t worsen dry eyes – it’s turning on the central heating that causes the problem, says Marchetti. ‘Central heating can make the atmosphere very dry so your eyes might feel worse.’ And if you’ve ever wondered why your eyes water during a winter walk, it’s because the wind has dried them out, she says. ‘It’s that reflex action again. The eyes are overproducing tears because they’re so dry.’ A NIGHT ON THE TILES WREAKS HAVOC . As if a hangover wasn’t bad enough, excessive drinking can cause sore eyes because of its dehydrating effect on the body, says Shamina Asif, from the College of Optometrists. And for women, if you do have a late night, don’t forget to take off your eye make-up. ‘If you leave it on, it can cause and aggravate blepharitis, a common condition where the rims of the eyelid become red, swollen and itchy and the eyelashes crusty. Everyone should also make sure they give the area around the eyes a good wash when washing their face to prevent the condition.’ Blepharitis can be caused by a bacterial infection, or it can be  a complication of a skin condition such as seborrhoeic dermatitis. ‘If the symptoms persist, you should see an optometrist,’ says Asif. DON’T WASTE TIME ON  EYE-BRIGHTENING DROPS . There are myriad eye drops for dry eyes, but always choose a preservative-free product, says Marchetti. The preservatives can, over time, cause you to develop an allergy and make dry eye syndrome worse. If a product is preservative-free, it should be stated on the pack. Some people can find it difficult to put in eye drops. However, there are products that can be sprayed on to a closed eye, allowing the drops to be absorbed through the margins of the eye. ‘Experts are divided as to whether or not they work, but a lot of my patients – especially those with shaky hands – find they are better than nothing,’ says Marchetti. If you do use eye drops, make sure you use them at least four to six times a day, she adds. ‘Eye drops usually give instant relief but usually folk don’t use them often enough, so they don’t think they work. And they should be seen as a long-term treatment.’ Speak to your pharmacist in the first instance, but if eye problem persists for more than two weeks, it might be worth visiting your GP. And don’t bother with drops that promise to brighten the eyes, Marchetti says. ‘These contain ingredients that work by constricting the blood vessels, making them look less red. But they won’t give any relief against dry eyes.’","Dry eye syndrome affects nearly five million Britons over 45 .
Not blinking enough, cold weather and hangovers can cause dry eyes ."

Art form: Thanks to the internet, the graffiti on girls artwork as become a real art form . The 'graffiti on girls' trend requires either a friend or boyfriend to do the artwork while the female exposes her flesh. Some girls also put tags on themselves, but can't get into hard to reach places such as their back. Water-based markers like those for outside are used to add the attractive design in a range of colours across the girls' legs or torso.

"A 16-year-old stowaway has miraculously survived flying halfway across the Pacific in the wheel well of a flight from California to Hawaii - despite temperatures of -81F (-62C) at 38,000 feet. The teen was discovered on the tarmac at the Maui airport on Sunday carrying no ID or belongings - apart from a comb - and told the FBI he had run away from home after an argument with his parents. 'Kid's lucky to be alive,' FBI spokesman Tom Simon in Honolulu said on Sunday night. Among those skeptical about his journey, medical experts said his body would have had to fall into a hibernation-like state - with his heart beating only a couple of times a minute - for him to survive. Scroll down for video . Amazing: This is the first picture of the 16-year-old boy who traveled from San Jose, California to Maui, Hawaii on Sunday . Miracle at Kahului Airport: The 16-year-old boy managed to survive for almost 6 hours in freezing temperatures at 38,000 feet during his stolen flight . But Simon said security footage from the San Jose airport verified that the boy, who is from Santa Clara, California, hopped a fence to get to Hawaiian Airlines Flight 45 on Sunday morning. Simon said when the flight landed in Maui, the boy remained unconscious for about an hour, but eventually hopped down from the wheel well and started wandering around the airport grounds. 'He was unconscious for the lion's share of the flight,' Simon said. The flight lasted about 5 1/2 hours. Hawaiian Airlines spokesman Alison Croyle said airline personnel noticed the boy on the ramp after the flight arrived and immediately notified airport security. A picture of the teen being taken away for medical care, looking awake and alert, was provided to the MailOnline by The Maui News. Plane: This is a 767-300 aircraft - the same model that the teen boy managed to stow himself away in . Staggering: The 16-year-old somehow survived unharmed while stowed in the wheel well . The boy was not charged with any crime and has been handed over to child protective services. 'Our primary concern now is for the well-being of the boy, who is exceptionally lucky to have survived,' Croyle said. Simon said the boy was medically screened and found to be unharmed. The . sheer physical stresses on the body any stowaway climbing inside the . landing gear faces are incredible. Most are simply fatal. According . to the Federal Aviation Administration's Civil Aerospace Medical . Institute, the chances of survival of a wheel-well stowaway on a . commercial aircraft are around 24 per cent. Avoiding . being crushed when the undercarriage retracts is the first challenge . faced and then in quick succession, hypothermia, hypoxia and ultimately . falling when the doors reopen. Obviously the landing gear well has no heat or oxygen supply and is not pressurized. At 18,000 feet, the oxygen supply becomes so depleted that the stowaway is likely to lose consciousness. Anywhere . above 33,000 feet, the stowaway's lungs would be in need of artificial . pressure to be able to expand and contract normally. Mount Everest is 29,029ft and only 5 per cent of the 3,000+ who have made that ascent have done so without oxygen . At 38,000 feet, the temperature would be no more than -81f, which usually would prove fatal within minutes. And . as the plane comes into land, assuming the stowaway is even conscious, . they would have to avoid being crushed again or falling thousands of . feet to their death. 'Doesn't even remember the flight,' Simon said. 'It's amazing he survived that.' But news of the survival was met with suspicion, as most wheel-well stowaways don't survive the freezing temperatures and lack of oxygen. Among the skeptics was ABC News aviation consultant John Nance, who said: 'This is a first in medical science and a first in physiology. I just don't believe it.' Dr. Richard Besser, ABC News' chief health and medical editor, said to survive such conditions, the body has to fall into a hibernation-like state, with the heart only beating a couple of times a minute. 'It's near impossible, almost miraculous, and maybe there's more to the story,' Besser said. Another aviation expert, Peter Forman, said that he was staggered the boy survived. 'The . odds of a person surviving that long of a flight at that altitude are . very remote, actually. I mean, you are talking about altitudes that are . well above the altitude of Mt. Everest. And temperatures that can reach 40 degrees below zero,' Forman said. 'A lot of people would only have useful consciousness for a minute or two at that altitude. 'For . somebody to survive multiple hours with that lack of oxygen and that . cold is just miraculous. I've never heard of anything like that before.' His misadventure also raised security questions. A Congressman who serves on the Homeland Security committee wondered how the teen could have got onto the airfield at San Jose unnoticed. 'I have long been concerned about security at our airport perimeters. #Stowaway teen demonstrates vulnerabilities that need to be addressed,' tweeted Rep. Eric Swalwell, a Democrat who represents the San Francisco Bay Area's eastern cities and suburbs. A call and email message to a Mineta San Jose International Airport spokeswoman were not immediately returned. Officials . at Kahului Airport referred questions to the State Department of . Transportation, which did not return a phone call seeking comment. Take-off: The 16-year-old boy sneaked onto the plane at San Jose airport in California (pictured) Hawaiian . Airlines Flight 24 to Oakland, California, was delayed nearly three hours . Sunday due to the incident. The flight was scheduled to leave Kahului at . noon and finally departed at 2:51 p.m. A male passenger who declined to be . identified said that he was seated on the plane to Oakland with his . family before he was notified of the delay. He said that flight . attendants were told to disarm the doors and that the flight would be . delayed 10 to 15 minutes. A Transportation Security Agency spokesman who declined to be named referred questions to the FBI and airport authorities. In August, a 13- or 14-year-old boy in Nigeria survived a 35-minute trip . in the wheel well of a domestic flight after stowing away. Authorities . credited the flight's short duration and altitude of about 25,000. Others stowing away in wheel wells have died, including a 16-year-old . killed after stowing away aboard a flight from Charlotte, North Carolina, to . Boston in 2010 and a 26-year-old man who fell onto a suburban London street from a flight from Angola in 2012. September 2012: . A 26-year-old Mozambique national flying from Angola to Heathrow . Airport in London was found dead in a suburban street under the flight . path after presumably falling to his death as the undercarriage opened. August 2012: . Another man was found dead in the landing gear bay of a Boring 747 when . it landed at Heathrow from a flight from Cape Town, South Africa. June 2010: . A 20-year-old Romanian man survived -41f temperatures for 100 minutes . during a flight from Vienna to Heathrow. He survived because the plane . stayed at 25,000 feet due to thunderstorms. 2006: .

"A letter written by a passenger on the Titanic describing the 'wonderful passage' - hours before the ship hit an iceberg - has sold at auction for £119,000 ($200,000). Auctioneer Andrew Aldridge said the handwritten note was bought by an anonymous telephone bidder at an auction in Devizes, western England, on Saturday. The price, which includes a fee known as the buyer's premium, topped the pre-sale estimate of £100,000 ($168,000). Last missive: The envelope of a letter written by Esther Hart and her seven-year-old daughter Eva as they sailed aboard RMS Titanic in April 1912, shortly before the ship struck an iceberg and sank in the North Atlantic Ocean . The letter was written by second-class passenger Esther Hart on April 14, 1912. 'The sailors say we have had a wonderful passage up to now,' she said in the note to family in England. Hours later the passenger liner described as 'practically unsinkable' hit an iceberg and sank, killing more than 1,500 people. Hart was among about 700 survivors. Sinking feeling: The 'unsinkable' ship sunk after hitting an iceberg on the same day Esther Hart penned a letter to her mother . Survivors: Esther and Eva Hart survived, and so did Esther's letter, because her husband put the letter inside the pocket of his coat which he gave to his wife to keep warm, giving exquisite details about the voyage aboard the ill-fated Titanic . The handwritten note on White Star Line notepaper was tucked inside the pocket of a sheepskin coat Hart's husband Benjamin gave her as he put Esther and their daughter Eva in a lifeboat. The family had been traveling from England to Canada, where they planned to settle. The letter was intended for Esther Hart's mother in Chadwell Heath, east London. In it, Hart wrote that the family was enjoying the journey, and that they expected to arrive at their destination early. According to auctioneer Andrew Aldridge, it's the only known letter to have been written aboard the ship on the day it hit the iceberg. The letter includes a postscript from Eva Hart, then aged seven: 'Heaps of love and kisses to all from Eva.' Benjamin Hart was among passengers and crew killed when the ship sank. Esther and Eva were rescued, along with some 700 others. Memorabilia: The handwritten letter was expected to sell for up to 100,000 pounds (US $168,000) but fetched even more at 119,000 pounds (U.S. $200,000) Esther Hart died in 1928. Eva Hart, who died in 1996, became a prominent Titanic survivor, critical of attempts to salvage the ship, which she considered a mass grave. She described the voyage, and her mother's letter, in an autobiography, 'Shadow of the Titanic.' Auctioneer Andrew Aldridge said the letter was 'quite simply the jewel in the crown of Titanic manuscript ephemera.' Fascination with the Titanic remains strong a century after the disaster, and prices for memorabilia from the ship have soared in recent years. In October a violin believed to have been played as the doomed vessel sank sold for more than £1 million.","A letter penned aboard the Titanic just before it hit an iceberg and sank has sold at action for £119,000 ($200,000)

"Councillors have slammed a £1.8million planned gypsy site as a 'glorified mod-con holiday camp' - and even a gypsy leader thinks it's too expensive. The revamp of a 13-pitch site near Bath will include driveways, street lights, soundproofing, landscaping and a permanent building next to each caravan with a kitchen, shower, toilet and living room. Each pitch is expected to cost around £140,000. But Conservatives and a national gypsy leader alike criticised the cost of the scheme, which could eventually rise to £2.5million, as too much of a burden on taxpayers. Holiday camp? Officials plan to revamp this traveller site near Bath - but its £1.8m cost has been attacked . Idyll: An artist's impression of how the site could look once work is completed next year. Conservative councillor Tim Warren said: 'It is costing a fortune and I just don't understand why' Tim . Warren, opposition group leader on Bath and North East Somerset Council, said: 'When the . plans first emerged I said it would be cheaper to buy 13 houses with . drives, now they are building the houses as well as the plots. 'It is costing a fortune and I just don't understand why. I have seen the plans, the buildings are really expensive. 'I think it's like the Hilton, it's just a glorified mod-con holiday camp. I agree that we need to address the travelling problem and make a site for them but this is over the top.' The council currently has £1.72million set aside for the revamp of the site, which is on the outskirts of the historic city and subject to a planning application. Officials will also be handed a £750,000 grant for the work by the government's Homes and Communities Agency if they include all the facilties, which are part of the government's standard requirements for new traveller sites. Each plot must have an amenity building, which will include a . minimum of hot and cold water, an electricity supply, heating, and space . for a cooker, fridge-freezer and a washing machine. The current site. Joseph P Jones, leader of the national Gypsy Council, told MailOnline: '[£140,000 per pitch] sounds quite high - you could build a two-storey house for less than that, let alone a small brick building' Plan: A view of how the site could look. The facilities must be included to obtain government funds . It . must also have a separate toilet and sink, a bath or shower room, a . kitchen or dining area, storage space, and ideally a living room. The proposed single-storey buildings are designed to be around the same size as a static caravan each and are thought to measure 33ft by 6ft. The site must also have water and waste drainage, lighting and fencing between the pitches. The final cost of the site has not been confirmed. Officials on the Liberal Democrat-run council currently say it will be around £1.8million - but some councillors claim that could rise to £2.5million. Those who live on the site will be charged rent of around £5,800 per pitch per year. But chairman of the national Gypsy Council Joseph P Jones told MailOnline the cost sounded too high. He said: . 'A concern that we've had for a long time is the inability of most local . authorities to deliver projects at a cost-effective price. 'Their contractors seem to charge so much more money than anyone else that I don't even understand where the funding goes. Tory councillor Tim Warren said: 'I agree that we need to address the problem but this is over the top' 'If it was someone from the community they could probably deliver the whole site for a fraction of that. 'It . sounds quite high - you could build a two-storey house for less than . that, let alone a small brick building with some hardstanding to park a . car. 'Those day rooms might still be just a bit bigger than a normal garage.' However, he insisted the buildings themselves were necessary. He said: 'It's quite . normal for gypsy sites to have a dayroom where people can spend time and . make sure they can keep themselves clean and tidy and prepare their . meals. 'It's a government . recommendation, a pitch should have a dayroom... That's the 21st . Century, that's what we live in, we don't expect to be living in tents . any more. 'Gypsies and . travellers have been forced into the situation they're in today inasmuch . as they're supposed to live on sites rather than having a travelling . lifestyle. The least the council can do is make sure the sites are . decent. 'If the local . councillors are complaining because these are bigger than what they've . seen in the past then they should look at where they live.' A . report set to go before the council's resources policy development and . scrutiny panel next week said the site will be developed and managed . by a unknown 'registered provider', whose job it will be to collect rent from the residents. Detailed: Full plans for the site, which could be completed by March next year. Mr Jones said: 'Contractors seem to charge so much money, I don't even understand where the funding goes' But Cllr Warren added the rent charges themselves could put many travellers off. 'Although it is addressing the . problem the people currently living on the site say they will be leaving . once it is done because it will be too expensive for them,' he said. 'It will just be shifting the problem else where. It is unbelievable, the money is ridiculous. 'The . budget for the whole thing would probably equate to, or be in excess of . every bit of council tax collected in the ward of Twerton, where it is . going to be based, in a year.' Bath and North East Somerset Council has a statutory duty to identify a certain number of gypsy and . traveller sites each year, and said the development work was necessary to stop . unauthorised traveller sites being set up around the area. Ben Lownes, a spokesman for the Homes and Communities Agency, said the body had agreed to provide funding for the gypsy site but the details were up to the council. He said: 'The traveller pitch funding programme which supports these projects is set up to provide new and improved pitches for travellers across England. 'We will have agreed to fund the programme as part of a national programme of activity. 'In terms of detail of what is provided, that is for whoever is bidding to the scheme to decide.' The HCA provides £60 million for projects to fund gypsy and travelling sites.","Cost of revamping 13-pitch traveller site near Bath could rise to £2.5million .

"Eric Abidal believes that Ligue 1 giants Paris Saint-Germain are a club with enough resources and ambition to lure Barcelona forward Lionel Messi away from the Nou Camp. The former France defender, who played club football with Messi at the Catalan side  between 2007 and 2013, told Telefoot, 'As he has won everything at Barcelona, he would perhaps consider a new challenge in order to win new things . 'It's possible. PSG has recently forged a group of players with determination and big objectives to reach. It may be a club that could please Messi.' Barcelona forward Lionel Messi has enjoyed huge success with the Catalan club . However, former France and Barcelona defender Eric Abidal feels Messi could do with a new challenge . Abidal suggested that Ligue 1 giants PSG could be a suitable destination for the 27-year-old . Since making his debut for Barcelona in 2004, Messi has won 20 trophies with the club, including six league titles and the Champions League three times. Individually, he is also Barcelona's all time leading goalscorer and a four-time winner of FIFA's Ballon d'Or. In recent months, it has been speculated that Messi's relationship with Barca manager Luis Enrique has broken down, intensifying talk of a move. However, Abidal insists that if Messi were to leave Barcelona, it would be for purely footballing reasons and not because he is a disruptive figure in the dressing room. Rather, he has commended the forward's consistently dazzling performances that have helped to keep the club challenging for honours, even amid off-field politics and transfer controversy. 'His influence on Barca is total. With his goals, he masks tensions, administrative or legal problems. He carries the team on his shoulders and allows it to live peacefully. He's part of a group of deciders,' Abidal said. Financed by foreign owners, PSG, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic, are one of the growing powerhouses in Europe . During his time at Barcelona, Messi has won FIFA's prestigious Ballon d'Or award four times . Messi has won 20 trophies with Barca, including three Champions League titles, the last coming in 2011 . Abidal has dismissed reports of a fallout between Messi and Barcelona manager Luis Enrique . Messi has been in superb form for Barcelona so far this season, scoring 37 goals in 34 games . 'I've never seen Leo ask for anything. Even regarding the team selection.' Of course, any club that does move for Messi will likely have to pay a world record transfer fee. The current record stands at £86million, set by Real Madrid's signing of Welsh winger Gareth Bale from Tottenham in 2013. Real Madrid broke the world record transfer fee in 2013, when they shelled out £86m to sign Gareth Bale .","Lionel Messi has enjoyed huge success  with Barcelona .

"Chicago is no stranger to corruption so perhaps it's unsurprising that recently released emails show how CNN worked with city officials to portray Mayor Rahm Emanuel in a positive light for 'unscripted' documentary series 'Chicagoland'. The Chicago Tribune obtained more than 700 emails that reveal how the CNN production team filming the eight-hour series worked with the mayor's office to develop storylines - getting their input on details like camera angles and the wording of press releases for the show. The emails are made all the more inflammatory by the fact that Emmanuel is currently running for re-election in 2015, and the documentary appears to be reinforcing his campaign. Exposed: Recently released emails show how CNN worked with Chicago city officials to portray Mayor Rahm Emanuel in a positive light for docu-series 'Chicagoland'. Emanuel is pictured above in a trailer for the series . Reality? Mayor Emanuel was prominently featured in the eight hour docu-series which premiered March 6 on CNN and was produced by Robert Redford . 'Make no mistake: This is Rahm Emanuel's story, his re-election campaign vehicle. This is the boss of Chicago selling his heroic narrative to American voters,' Tribune columnist John Cass wrote following the report. The pandering starts as early as October 2013, when director Marc Benjamin writes Emanuel's director of communications, asking for more access to the mayor in the series, which was shot the following spring. 'I know I am needy but we want more of Rahm in the series, I know I sound like a [broken]record, but in the Feb '14 broadcast, Rahm will look good making ""his"" points,' Benjamin writes. By February, CNN seems to have struck a deal with Emanuel when executive producer Marc Levin sends off an email to a press aide, saying he is 'thrilled that City Hall and the Mayor have agreed to assist our production team, help steer us to strong stories and participate directly in the CNN series.' When they started filming the series, Emanuel was planning on closing 50 public schools, the largest school closure in the city's history. Profile in leadership: When the crew started filming the series last spring, Emanuel was in the process of closing 50 Chicago public schools and they used that moment to 'highlight the Mayor's leadership'. Emanuel pictured above visiting a school during the education crisis . The 'star' of the show: Executive producer Marc Levin said in one email that they wanted to 'present' Emanuel 'as the star he really is' The CNN producers hoped to take advantage of that moment to 'highlight the Mayor's leadership,' going into detail on exactly what kind of shots they needed - such as the mayor talking on his phone in the car. More conflict of interest: Emanuel previously served as President Obama's chief of staff before running for mayor. He is the brother of Hollywood talent agent Ari Emanuel, who represents two of Chicagoland's producers. Above, the president and Emanuel together in October 2010 . 'I know we still have time to round out the mayor's story and present him as the star he really is,' Levin writes in another email. The mayor's press office was so involved in the production that they even edited news releases prepared by CNN to announce the show, as shown in one email. The press office also helped the team gain access to the Blackhawks hockey team. Episode two of the series largely followed the team on their road to the Stanley Cup. Besides the shady staging of Emanuel in the documentary, there are some other noted conflicts of interests. Producers Levin and Benjamin are both represented by William Morris talent agency, which is run by Ari Emanuel - the mayor's brother. When reached by the Tribune for comment, Levin said that everything Emanuel does is 'stage-managed'. 'That is the way he operates, so I'm not going to dispute that,' Levin said. 'I would be the first to acknowledge that you don't get into Chicago...and get access without having to do a certain dance.' CNN reinforced that message in a statement to Mediaite Friday. 'The mayor’s office was never granted editorial control over the content or the press communications for Chicagoland, and no agency was ever granted authority to offer the mayor’s office editorial approval for the content or the promotional materials for the series.' Chicagoland premiered March 6 on CNN after being showcased at the Sundance Film Fesitival in January. It was produced by Robert Redford.","Over 700 emails obtained by the Chicago Tribune show how CNN worked with the mayor's office to make him look good in a documentary series .

"Labour’s deputy leader Harriet Harman finally broke her silence yesterday over her links with a paedophile group. Miss Harman, her MP husband Jack Dromey and former Health Secretary Patricia Hewitt have been under mounting pressure to explain the connections to the Paedophile Information Exchange while holding key roles in the National Council for Civil Liberties. The pressure group granted ‘affiliate’  status to PIE, a notorious group of  predatory paedophiles. Last night Miss Harman dismissed the revelations as a ‘politically-motivated  smear campaign’ and offered no apology over the NCCL’s extraordinary relationship with the PIE. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Scandal: After six days of questions over her links to a paedophile group, Labour's Harriet Harman has finally expressed regret but not a full apology . That is despite the fact that Shami Chakrabarti, current director of Liberty – the new name for NCCL – has previously issued an apology for the links with PIE. In a statement Miss Harman said: ‘They have accused me of being an apologist for child sex abuse, of supporting a vile paedophile organisation, of having a relaxed attitude to paedophilia and of watering down child pornography laws. ‘These are horrific allegations and I strongly deny all of them.’ The Mail discovered that during the 1970s and 80s, the NCCL described PIE – granted formal ‘affiliate’ status from 1975 to the mid-Eighties – in glowing terms as ‘a campaigning/counselling group for adults attracted to children’. NCCL archives showed how the pressure group lobbied Parliament for the age of sexual consent to be cut to ten if the child consented and ‘understood the nature of the act’. It also called for incest to be legalised in what one MP called a ‘Lolita’s charter’. The NCCL – now the respected  Liberty – filed a submission to Parliament claiming that ‘childhood sexual experiences, willingly engaged in, with an adult, result in no identifiable damage’. Miss Harman, as NCCL legal officer, tried to water down child pornography laws. NCCL lawyers acted for PIE members who were questioned by police over their disgusting behaviour. Silence: Until now Miss Harman has said only that the Mail's story is 'untrue and ridiculous' but refused to answer any questions, as did her husband Jack Dromey (pictured) and Labour colleague Patricia Hewitt . Miss Hewitt was general  secretary of the NCCL from 1974-83, Miss Harman was a newly qualified solicitor when she became its legal officer in 1978 until 1982, when she entered Parliament. Mr Dromey sat on the NCCL executive committee from 1970 to 1979. Police are investigating PIE as part of Operation Fernbridge, launched after the Jimmy Savile affair, with one source saying there is evidence that PIE  members were abusing children ‘on an industrial scale’. Former health secretary Patricia Hewitt was general secretary of the NCCL from 1974-83 . The Home Office is also  carrying out a ‘thorough,  independent investigation’ into shocking claims that the Labour government of the 1970s may have helped finance the notorious group. Ever since December, when The Mail first investigated the NCCL’s links to the paedophile lobby, we have been sending detailed questions to Miss  Harman, Miss Hewitt and Mr Dromey about their links to PIE and whether they now regret supporting such a group. Miss Hewitt has still to respond but Miss Harman – after initially dismissing the story as ‘untrue and ridiculous’ – and her husband finally issued a statement via the Labour Party yesterday. Miss Harman denied allegations that she supported lowering the age of consent to ten or opposed the law on incest – despite the Mail investigation never having made such a claim. Instead this newspaper stated that the NCCL, which she joined in 1978, had controversially lobbied on these issues two years earlier. Miss Harman also denied having opposed the law on incest – again, an allegation the Mail did not make. This was, nevertheless, the NCCL’s  position when she became its  legal officer. Miss Harman also said that an allegation that she sought in 1978 to water down a proposed ban on child pornography was untrue – although her name is on the NCCL’s four-page submission to MPs urging that ‘images of naked children should only be considered pornographic if it could be proven that the subject had suffered’. 1978 briefing: The NCCL legal officer Harriet Harman wrote this briefing paper on the Protection of Children Bill, which sought to ban child pornography. She argued that it would lead to an 'increase in censorship' Argument: The second page contains a paragraph saying that a picture should not be considered indecent if the model was not harmed . Recommendations: Miss Harman's briefing went on that the NCCL would argue that the Bill to protect children should be amended . Signed: The Labour Deputy Leader's name is carried at the bottom of a briefing that argued that a pornographic picture of a naked child should not be considered indecent unless it could be proven that the subject had suffered . Responding to the NCCL’s decision to grant ‘affiliate’ status to the notorious paedophile group, Miss Harman said: ‘The Mail have tried to make me guilty by way of guilt by association. When I was at NCCL there were around 6,000 members and nearly 1,000 affiliated organisations of which PIE was one. I was aware that because NCCL opposed censorship and supported gay rights, paedophiles had sought to exploit that and use NCCL as a vehicle to make their arguments. ‘But by the time I came to work for NCCL this vile organisation had already been vigorously challenged within the organisation.’ She added: ‘The reason I decided to go to work for NCCL was because I actively supported the work they had done and in particular the work of their women’s rights committee on the Equal Pay Act, on the introduction of the Sex Discrimination Act and for greater protection of victims of domestic violence and against race discrimination.’ Last night Miss Harman gave an interview to Newsnight on BBC2 but still repeatedly failed to apologise. She refused eight times to accept that the connection with PIE was a mistake. Mr Dromey said: ‘During my time on the NCCL executive, I was at the forefront of repeated public condemnations of PIE and their despicable views. ‘The accusations of the Daily Mail are untrue and beneath contempt.’ Labour leader Ed Miliband defended his deputy: ‘Harriet Harman is somebody of huge decency and integrity. I know she has a long and proud record of being on the right side of all of these issues.’ Last night the Mail said: ‘For ten weeks now the Mail has repeatedly asked three leading Labour figures to answer questions about the involvement of the NCCL, a body in which they played leading roles, with a vile paedophile group whose actions are currently being investigated by the police. ‘The belated statements today of Miss Harman and her husband – full of pedantry and obfuscation – fail to answer the Mail’s central points and deny allegations the Mail has not made. ‘More pertinently they have failed to utter a word of contrition or sorrow about the NCCL’s closeness to the notorious Paedophile Information Exchange, an organisation that validated the activities of a monster like Jimmy Savile.  Nor do they utter a word of apology to the victims of PIE. ‘In stark contrast, Shami Chakrabarti, the director of Liberty, which took over the NCCL’s mantle, has condemned the historic links with PIE as a “source of continuing disgust and horror”. As for smears, it is a newspaper’s job to ask awkward and controversial questions – questions that in this instance are still awaiting a satisfactory answer.’","Labour’s deputy leader Harriet Harman finally broke silence .

"Newcastle United have put no timescale on Siem de Jong’s return to action after he underwent surgery on a collapsed lung - raising the possibility that he will miss the remainder of the season. The 26-year-old was initially ruled out for eight weeks but head coach John Carver says the former Ajax captain will only return when he is ready. De Jong also suffered a collapsed lung at the beginning of last season in Holland and has been plagued by injury since making his £6million move to Newcastle in the summer. And Carver said: ‘It's a huge blow, but more so for the boy himself because he is such a great lad. We have not given a guideline on coming back - the most important thing for me is his health, and he will decide when he is ready to come back. Former Ajax star signed for Newcastle last summer for a £6million fee but has struggled with injuries . ‘He will be under no pressure. We will do everything right to make sure everything is done for him properly. ‘I went to see him in hospital and he was in good spirits, but obviously it's a huge operation that he has had. ‘But they say once you have had the operation then it shouldn't happen again, so that's good news. ‘He’s had a tough time though,' Meanwhile, Carver confirmed that Paul Dummett’s season could also be over after he picked up a knee injury during last week’s 1-1 draw at Crystal Palace.

"A group of soldiers in the Central African Republic lynched a man they suspected was a rebel minutes after hearing the new president's promise to restore security at a ceremony to reinstate the divided country's armed forces. About 20 uniformed soldiers accused a member of the crowd of having belonged to Seleka - the mostly Muslim rebel group that seized power in a coup last March, before stabbing him repeatedly until he was dead. A soldier stamped on the lifeless body, which was then dragged nearly naked through the streets as residents looked on and took photographs. Violence: A Central African Army soldier stabs the man who was accused of joining the ousted Seleka rebel group . Ten minutes earlier the new interim president, Catherine Samba-Panza, stood just 20m away where she addressed a crowd of at least 1,000 soldiers. The Army effectively disappeared during nine months of Seleka rule. She told the gathering at a training ground in the capital Bangui: 'Within a month, I would like to fully secure the greater part of the country and I aim to stick to my word.' Seleka disbanded after Samba-Panza's inauguration last month and is deeply resented by the Christian majority after months of lootings and killings. WARNING GRAPHIC VIDEO . Members of the Central African Armed Forces (FACA) lynch a man suspected of being a former Seleka rebel . A soldier stabs the lifeless body, which was then dragged nearly naked through the streets . The violence spawned the creation of Christian 'anti-balaka' militias, meaning 'anti-machete' in the local Sango language, and more sectarian blood-letting. About one million people, a quarter of the former French colony's population, have fled their homes. The presence of 1,600 French soldiers and 5,000 African troops has so far failed to stop the tit-for-tat violence which the United Nations says has already killed more than 2,000 people. Newly enlisted FACA soldiers kick the face of a suspected Muslim Seleka militiaman moments after Central African Republic Interim President Catherine Samba-Panza addressed the troops in Bangui . Peter Bouckaert, emergencies director at Human Rights Watch in Bangui, tweeted that the corpse of the lynched man had been burned. He posted a photograph showing a man holding up a severed limb next to a bonfire, as an armed French soldier gestured in the background. Samba-Panza, appointed by parliament two weeks ago after coup leader Michel Djotodia stepped down under intense international pressure for failing to stop the violence, made clear it would take time to restore order. Central Africa Republic's interim president Catherine Samba Panza addresses members of the Central African Armed Forces (FACA) before the man was lynched . 'At a certain point, everyone will be held responsible for their acts, I am warning troublemakers who continue to sow disorder in the country.' She also urged former soldiers to report for duty, saying those who did not would be considered deserters. Central African Republic, one of Africa's poorest countries despite mineral riches, has a history of instability, and has seen five coups and several rebellions since winning independence from France in 1960. According to a timetable established as part of a regionally brokered peace deal agreed last year, elections are supposed to be held by February 2015.","20 uniformed soldiers accused member of crowd of belonging to Seleka .

"Police say they walked into a bloody, chaotic scene the night two former Auburn University football players and another man were shot to death at a party. The officers testified Friday as the trial opened for the man charged in the killings, 24-year-old Desmonte Leonard. Prosecutors are after a death sentence. Desmonte Leonard enters the courtroom before opening statements on Friday as prosecutors asked jurors in opening statements to convict him of capital murder . Police described getting reports of multiple gunshots at an apartment clubhouse on June 9, 2012, and arriving to find one former player dead in a flower bed. Another man was dead on a sidewalk, and a third man was fighting for life in a pool of blood. The dead have been identified as former Auburn players Ed Christian and Ladarious Phillips and Opelika's DeMario Pitts, reports AL.com. Prosecutors told jurors in opening statements that Leonard began shooting after a verbal dispute escalated into a fistfight. Leonard shot as many as nine rounds into the group, AL.com reports. He then fled the scene. The defense concedes Leonard was the gunman but says he fired in self-defense. They're citing Alabama's 'stand your ground' law. 'Mr. Leonard thought he was going to die,' said his attorney, Jeff Duffey. He continued in opening statements: 'This is a case where Mr. Leonard was assaulted himself, he was attacked, and he defended himself. There was no premeditation.' Leonard's defense claims he has a 'heightened sense of awareness' to threats after being shot in the abdomen in 2008. The trial's first witness, Auburn Police Sgt. Darrell Downing, described the scene as 'mass chaos.' As the first officer on the scene, he saw people scattering in all directions and the dead in pools of their own blood. He agreed that Alabama state law would allow someone to use deadly force if they believe their own lives are threatened. 'That is really what this case is about, the Stand Your Ground law,' he said.","Accused gunman Desmonte Leonard's attorneys say he's innocent under 'Stand Your Ground' law .

"Scroll down for video . The Ferguson police officer who was shot in the arm was released from the hospital as the search for the shooter continues, police say. The officer was shot during a routine patrol near the new Ferguson Community Center and away from the protests related to the death of Michael Brown. The body camera worn by the officer was off at the time, though officials do not know why. Officials say that the officer saw the suspect standing behind the community center and gave chase after he fled. The suspect turned and fired at the officer, striking him in the left arm. The New York Times reported that the suspect fled into the woods, but that an hour and a half search by Ferguson and other departments turned up empty. The reports revised earlier statements that there were two shooters and that the officer was responding to a burglary. St Louis County Police spokesperson Sgt Brian Schellman said that the officer was wearing a body camera that was turned off for an unknown reason at the time of the shooting. Ferguson police began wearing body cameras in August that had been donated by two security companies. The officer was treated for non-life threatening injuries and officials believe he will live after being released from the hospital. Another shooting, this of an off-duty St Louis Metropolitan Police officer, happened hours later, though there are no indications it is related to events in Ferguson. An earlier press conference by St Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said police are hunting for the suspect and he did not think the shooting was related to protests over Michael Brown’s death at the hands of white police officer Darren Brown. Shooting: Missouri State Highway Patrol troopers stand posted at the corner of Chambers Road and West Florissant Avenue on Saturday in Ferguson as police search for a suspect in the shooting of a police officer . Location: Police have set up a staging area  on West Florissant Road in Ferguson, Missouri, according to local news station KMOV . Crime scene: A police officer takes pictures outside the Ferguson Community Center at 1050 Smith Avenue on Saturday night after the shooting . Police line: St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar, left, and Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson gather together over the search for the suspect  who shot an officer . Show of force: Officers line up with helmets on in front of a crowd which gathered in Ferguson Saturday night . The center is located  away from where the protesters had gathered and Belmar said he did not think the shooting was related to protests over Brown’s death. 'I don’t think it is,' he said. 'It didn’t happen within the proximity of the protest area. This is a fairly secluded area. I wouldn’t have any reason to think that it was linked in any way, shape or form. At the original press conference, Belmar said officers chased two suspects, and as he closed in on one of them, the second suspect pulled out a gun and fired at the officer, who was shot in one arm before returning fire. Officials have not released the officer’s name or said how long he had been on the police force. Mike O'Connell, communications director for the State Emergency Management Agency, said authorities were looking for the suspect. He said: 'A search is underway for the suspect in the shooting of the officer.' Search: Police officers from various forces have gathered in the area to deal with the aftermath of the shooting . Police from various different forces  responded to the scene  and set up a staging area on West Florissant Road, KMOV reported. Reports indicate that the suspect fled on foot into a neighborhood near West Florissant Avenue and Stein Street. Officers and police helicopters canvassed the area in an attempt to find the shooter. There were conflicting reports over the reason for the shooting which appears not to be linked to protests over the death of Michael Brown by a white police officer. NBC News reported an officer interrupted a burglary at a business on Saturday night and was shot in the arm once before the suspect ran off. Crowd: A small crowd of people have gathered near police close to the staging area . Scene: Police from various different forces along with helicopters have responded to the scene . Earlier on Saturday, an eyewitness told NBC News: 'Everybody was fine, they said, police stay back and then all of a sudden a black guy came pushing everybody, when I was right behind the chief.' Antonio French, an Alderman of the 21st ward in St. Louis tweeted: 'Police are being instructed to get in riot gear.' According to several eyewitness accounts on Twitter, Captain Ron Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol told protestors: 'I'm going to ask you to leave and I'm only asking you one time.' In a video posted on social media Johnson then told protesters that the officer was the only person who was shot. Meanwhile, a small, peaceful crowd of local residents gathered near the police staging area on West Florissant Road. Crowd: A police car drives past a small peaceful crowd of local residents as officers hunt for the suspect . Eyewitness: This unnamed eyewitness told NBC News everything was calm until 'a black guy came pushing everybody' Suspect: Chief Jackson said police are hunting for the suspect and he did not think the shooting was related to protests over Michael Brown’s death at the hands of white police officer Darren Brown . Vice News reports that a St Louis Metropolitan Police officer was injured when a black sedan crossed two lanes of traffic and fired into his personal vehicle on Interstate 70. An unknown number of shooters produced handguns and fired at the vehicle. The driver of the vehicle was injured by the shattered window. Officials say the officer was wearing the pants of his St Louis Metropolitan Police uniform, but not the shirt or jacket. The incident is being investigated and it is unclear whether it was a targeted attempt on the officer's life. The shootings came just days after Ferguson police chief Tom Jackson issued a video apology to Brown's parents following weeks of heavy criticism and calls for him to resign. In the video released on Thursday Jackson apologized to the parents for taking so long to remove the body of their son from the street. Sorry: Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson released this video apology on Thursday to the family of  Michael Brown and apologized for leaving the teenager's body in the street for so long . Dead: Police took more than four hours to remove Brown's body from the street where he was shot August 9 . Shot and killed: Michael Brown, left, was unarmed when he was shot dead by Police Officer Darren Wilson . 'I want to say this to the Brown family: No one who has not experienced the loss of a child can understand what you're feeling. I am truly sorry for the loss of your son,' Jackson said. But his apology was not well-received among some and led to reported protests hours after it was issued. The grieving parents of Michael Brown said they were unmoved by the apology made by the Ferguson police chief - over a month after their unarmed teenage son was shot dead by an officer. Michael Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, called for Chief Jackson to be fired and his father, Michael Brown Sr., said rather than an apology, he would like to see Officer Darren Wilson arrested. Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager was fatally shot by Officer Darren Wilson on August 9, despite several eyewitness accounts which suggested he had his hands up in a 'don't shoot' position. His death sparked days of protests, some violent and many peaceful, in the predominately black neighborhood of Ferguson Missouri where racial tensions reached boiling point.

In the video apology, Jackson apologized for the heavy handed response from his officers towards the peaceful protesters. But earlier this week, police officers from the St. Louis County Department were spotted wearing ‘I am Darren Wilson’ bracelets whilst on duty. Residents from Ferguson complained about the black bracelets - which had stark white lettering on them with the words 'I am Darren Wilson' emblazoned across them - during a meeting with federal officials.","St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said he does not believe the shooting was connected with the two protests occurring at the same time .

"Often carefree, cash-rich and keen to hang on to their youthful vigour, Britain’s over-50s have been dubbed the ‘Superboomers’. Wealthier, healthier and more active than their predecessors, a report says this generation are leading subtle shifts in society. Having climbed the career ladder when the economy was booming, this group has a respect for life experience and the insights that come with age, it is said. Scroll down for video . Living life to the full: According to the report, Britain's over-50s are more active and outgoing than ever . Fitter than ever: The report showed that over-50s stay active for longer - and peak gym attendance age is 66 . The Superboomers are following their dreams. They keep fit, set up their own businesses, get online, travel and re-enter the dating game. The report says: ‘They may have accumulated a few more wrinkles, but revolution is in their nature. They are healthier, fitter and wealthier than those who have gone before them, and are no longer constrained by what people think.’ The Baby Boomer generation, born after the war, forms nearly a quarter of the UK population and controls more than three-quarters of the nation’s wealth. Over-50s spend more on beauty products, luxury travel and culture than younger people, with women in this group spending £2.7billion a year on clothes, shoes and accessories. As a result, companies are keener to win the Superboomers’ custom, says research by consultants The Future Laboratory commissioned by technology firm Huawei. Major fashion brands are choosing older women and men to front advertising campaigns as grey hair is reclaimed as a sign of a ‘hip, defiant, pro-age’ attitude. The report claims: ‘With fitter bodies, more active minds and entrepreneurial power, this group is increasingly becoming the face of British fashion, beauty, design and media.’ The Superboomers are nearly as technology-savvy as their children and grandchildren, with eight out of ten having internet access and two-thirds using online shopping. But they take a more cautious approach to handing over personal details to websites and social networks than younger people. New online dating services aimed at older people are springing up, but this generation is more wary about the privacy implication of sites like Google and Facebook, which are free but make their money by employing users’ data to sell advertising. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the vast majority of Superboomers are strongly opposed to the idea of having to give up their independence in their final years. Fewer than one in five of those aged 60 to 65 would consider moving to a care home if they became frail in old age. The report concludes: ‘The centre of social, cultural and economic gravity is clearly going to shift to the Superboomers. ‘While youth once symbolised everything that was to do with innovation, freedom, fun and adventure, this group has the money and time to enjoy a boundaryless existence.’ Tom Savigar, chief strategy officer of The Future Laboratory, said: ‘The Superboomer is redefining what it means to be older in British society and culture. ‘This generation of over-achievers climbed the career ladder when the economy was booming, house prices were soaring and opportunity was everywhere. Retirement offers them the chance to rev up rather than slow down.’","Over-50s control majority of Britain's wealth - and are making the most of it .

"North Korean authorities say are holding a U.S. tourist after he apparently tried to claim asylum in the pariah state. The 24-year-old was arrested for improper behaviour while he was bring processed to enter the Communist dictatorship as a tourist, state media reported. The arrest was announced as Barack Obama issued a stark warning to North Korean despot Kim Jong-un of fresh economic sanctions over his nuclear ambitions. The U.S. President said he would stand 'shoulder to shoulder' with South Korea in opposing the North's plans for a fourth nuclear test. Sunan International Airport, Pyongyang: An American who came to North Korea on a tourist visa then tried to claim asylum in the pariah state has been arrested for improper behaviour, North Korean media reports . The American arrested by officials in North Korea was identified as Miller Matthew Todd - possibly putting his surname first. The official North Korean Central News agency said he had entered the country on April 10 with a tourist visa, but then tore it up and shouted that he wanted to seek asylum there. The brief report said he chose the North 'as a shelter'. In Washington, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters that the U.S. is aware of the report, but she did not confirm an American was being held. She said the department is in touch with the Swedish Embassy which handles consular cases for the U.S. because Washington does not have diplomatic relations with Pyongyang. 'There is no greater priority to us than the welfare and safety of U.S. citizens. We don't have additional information to share at this time,' Ms Psaki said. A large number of foreign tourists were in North Korea in mid-April to see events held for the anniversary of national founder Kim Il Sung's April 15 birthday. North Korea has been trying to boost tourism recently to generate income, but it also continues to be highly sensitive about the activities and conduct of foreigners who are allowed in. It remains ostracised internationally for its insistence on developing nuclear weapons. As the country threatened new nuclear tests Obama said it may be time to consider further sanctions. Stark warning: Addressing a joint news conference alongside South Korean President Park Geun-hye (left), Obama said threats by North Korea will get it 'nothing except further isolation' from the global community . Testing times: He made the comments hours after North Korea made its feelings on his visit clear, sending two DPRK patrol boats into South Korean waters, violating the maritime border and forcing its neighbour to respond with a series of warning shots. Finally the vessels withdrew . Nuclear ambitions: Kim Jong-un is threatening its fourth nuclear test - a move that has rattled nerves across south-east Asia, in particular Japan and South Korea . But Obama acknowledged there are limits to what impacts additional penalties can have on the country. 'North Korea already is the most isolated country in the world by far,' Obama said.

We have to make sure that, in strong concert with our allies, that we are continuing to press North Korea to change its approach,' Obama said, presenting a united front in the presence of Park. The White House said it was keeping close tabs on activity at North Korea's nuclear test site, where commercial satellite imagery this week showed increased activity. Park said the assessment of her government is that North Korea is 'fully ready now' to conduct another nuclear test. 'This is a very tense situation,' she said.

He added that those women deserve to be heard and respected and that there should be a clear account of what happened. As he addressed historical tensions between U.S. allies Japan and South Korea, he said the Japanese people and their prime minister understand the past must be recognized honestly.

"Edward Snowden, the former CIA analyst behind the NSA leaks, has claimed that the U.S. government has been hacking Hong Kong and Chinese networks for at least four years. In his first interview since he revealed himself on Sunday, the 29-year-old whistleblower told the South China Morning Post that the NSA has hacked the country's universities, businesses and politicians. He claimed the agency had hundreds of targets - including the Chinese University of Hong Kong - from as far back as 2009, but that these were just a fraction of the 61,000 NSA hacking operations carried out globally. He added that none of the documents revealed any information about Chinese military systems. Scroll down for video . Defiant: NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden has spoken in an exclusive interview with a Chinese newspaper and said he will remain in Hong Kong and fight any extradition bid from the U.S. 'We hack network backbones – like huge internet routers, basically – that give us access to the communications of hundreds of thousands of computers without having to hack every single one,' he explained. The hour-long interview, which took part in a secret location on Wednesday, came after Snowden fled to Hong Kong from his home in Hawaii on May 20 after leaking sensitive documents about the NSA. His actions have been both praised and . condemned globally, with some hailing him a hero while others, including . House Speaker John Boehner, calling him a traitor. But in the exclusive interview, he said: 'I'm neither traitor nor hero. I'm an American.' He . said he will stay in Hong Kong to fight any extradition bid from the . U.S, and he hit back against people who have called his choice to flee . to Hong Kong a gamble. Sighting: A woman believed to be the mother of Snowden's girlfriend, Lindsay Mills, is pictured outside her home in Annapolis, Maryland on Wednesday morning . Distraught: Miss Mills, whose mother is pictured outside her Maryland home on Wednesday, has not been seen since her boyfriend Edward Snowden revealed himself as the whistleblower . 'People who think I made a mistake in picking HK as a location misunderstand my intentions,' he said. 'I am not here to hide from justice; I am here to reveal criminality. 'My intention is to ask the courts and people of Hong Kong to decide my fate. I have been given no reason to doubt your system.' It is believed the U.S. is pursuing a criminal investigation against Snowden, and on Tuesday, sources said officials were preparing to bring charges against him. No extradition request has yet been filed. In another clip of the interview Snowden said he has heard from a reliable source that the government is 'trying to bully the Hong Kong government into extraditing me'. 'I will never feel safe,' he said, adding that he has also not contacted his family because he fears their safety too. 'Things are very difficult for me in all terms, but speaking truth to power is never without risk,' he said. 'It has been difficult, but I have been glad to see the global public speak out against these sorts of systemic violations of privacy . His interview comes two days after Snowden checked out of a Hong Kong hotel where he was interviewed by the Guardian newspaper, which first published the story. Since then, he has been nowhere to be seen. Left behind: Lindsay Mills, Snowden's girlfriend, is said to be 'barely holding on' after he left abruptly . In the Guardian interview, he had . said he wanted to avoid the media spotlight, noting he didn't want 'the . story to be about me. I want it to be about what the U.S. government is . doing'. With . little new information to report on Snowden or his whereabouts, focus has instead fallen on his American girlfriend, Lindsay Mills, a dancer who posted partially nude . photographs of herself online before she also apparently disappeared. Reporter . Ewen MacAskill of Britain's the Guardian newspaper, who interviewed . Snowden for exclusive stories about his revelations, wrote late Tuesday . that 'it is thought' Snowden was now in a private home in Hong Kong, but . offered no details.

New information: Journalists film outside the headquarters of South China Morning Post in Hong Kong as the paper began to publish its interview with the whistleblower . Where is he? Snowden's whereabouts are unknown after he checked out of this hotel in Hong Kong on Sunday . The country has been divided in . praising or condemning Snowden after he leaked information about a . global eavesdropping operation, Prism, put in place by the government. 'He's . a traitor,' Boehner told ABC on Tuesday. 'The disclosure of this . information puts Americans at risk.  It shows our adversaries what our . capabilities are. And it’s a giant violation of the law.' Also . on Tuesday, Snowden's employers, Booz Allen Hamilton, announced that it . has terminated his contract 'for violations of the firm’s code of . ethics and firm policy'. It . said that the claims he had leaked information were 'shocking' - and . revealed that he was earning $122,000 rather than the $200,000 he told . The Guardian he was paid. As . for his future prospects - although Hong Kong has an extradition treaty . with the U.S., the document has some exceptions, including for crimes . deemed political. Keeping quiet: Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald, who broke the story and interviewed Snowden at his Hong Kong hotel, has not revealed where the whistleblower is or what his future plans are . Any negotiations about his possible handover will involve Beijing, but some believe China is unlikely to want to jeopardize its relationship with the U.S. over someone of little political interest to them. Snowden also told The Guardian that he may seek asylum in Iceland, which has strong free-speech protections and a tradition of providing a haven for the outspoken and the outcast. And even Russia has stepped up to say it would consider offering him political asylum if he sought it. 'We will take action based on what actually happens. If we receive such a request, it will be considered,' said the Russian president's official spokesman Dmitry Peskov.","Edward Snowden spoke with the South China Morning Post on Wednesday .

"Rats scurrying to escape rising floodwaters in New York could spread diseases as they infest new areas, according to a nature expert. A 13ft wall of water caused by the storm surge and high tides have caused severe flooding to subways and road tunnels in the city and torrents of water poured into city streets. The rising water will force rats out of their underground lairs and into contact with humans, according to Rick Ostfeld of the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Milbrook, New York, speaking to The Huffington Post. Scroll down for video . Vermin: Stock picture of rats in New York. Rats could come into contact with humans as they seek safety from the flood . He says rats are expert survivors and will escape the floods and head for safer ground, such as apartments and other buildings inhabited by humans. He said: 'Rats are incredibly good swimmers and they can climb.' According to Ostfeld, this could result a rise in infectious diseases carried by urban rats, including leptospirosis, hantavirus, typhus, salmonella, and even the plague. 'One of things we know can exacerbate disease is massive dispersal,' he added. 'Rats are highly social individuals and live in a fairly stable social structure. If this storm disturbs that, rats could start infesting areas they never did before.' Rats don't need to bite a human to transmit the diseases as rodent faeces and urine can spread conditions like hantavirus. Flood: A flooded Midtown Tunnel in New York City after Sandy hit the US East Coast on Monday night . Rats could be forced into contact with people by the rising waters . However, Ostfeld suggested that the huge volume of water Sandy has brought should dilute the pathogens, reducing the risk to the public. There are precedents for rats being displaced by floods and forced into buildings. In the UK this summer washed out rats began infesting homes. 'It's not just about the high winds and rain,' said Ostfeld. 'A rat disturbance is something we should be concerned about.'","Rats escaping New York floods could infest homes .

"A high-profile homeowners association scandal in Nevada claimed more victims when two key figures in the case were found dead this week. Attorney David Amesbury, 57, who had cut a deal with federal investigators in a far-reaching investigation, was found dead from apparent hanging at his brother's home in Grass Valley, California. Amesbury's brother found him hanging in a shed. His death comes just days after Nancy Quon, 51, a construction defect lawyer, committed suicide in the bathtub of her Henderson, Nevada condominium. Her body was found by a relative. Tragedy: David Amesbury and Nancy Quon, both implicated in a federal homeowners association probe, died of apparent suicide this week . Nancy Quon (left)  and former boyfriend William Ronald Webb (far right) appear in court Sept. 1, 2011. The two pleaded not guilty to multiple felonies in an arson-suicide-murder scheme . The investigation had already claimed two other lives. Former police lieutenant Chris Van . Cleef shot himself dead in 2008 shortly after an FBI raid in the . investigation, and Robbie Castro, a Visitana, Nevada, homeowners . association board member, also died from a drug overdose in 2010. A U.S. Justice Department investigation . alleges that, starting in 2008, Amesbury and nine other defendants . helped take over homeowner association boards through rigged elections . and then steered legal and construction contracts to specific firms. Quon, a single mother, was a major player in the scheme, federal officials say, but had not yet been indicted by prosecutors. Autopsy results for Quon won't be made . public until blood toxicology test results are known, according to the . Clark County Coroner's office. Quon had previously tried to commit suicide, police say. 'I know of no specific reason why he would have done this,' Frank Cremen, Amesbury's defense lawyer, told ABC News. 'I know his family doesn't believe it was suicide,' he added. Another defense attorney in the federal case says the recent deaths are creating anxiety among those named in the probe. The U.S. Justice Department alleges 10 defendants found 'straw purchasers' to . buy condominiums and run for seats on the homeowner boards. The . 'straw buyers,' who were elected board members by forging documents and . digging up dirt on other board candidates, pretended to be legitimate . buyers but were colluding with other defendants in the case. Once on the boards of these homeowner associations, members lobbied for construction defect lawsuits against builders and then steered legal and construction contracts to preferred firms. 'Some of the witnesses are extremely . concerned about their well-being and safety,"" the defense lawyer told . the Las Vegas Review Journal. Amesbury and Quon are the third and fourth victims connected to the homeowners association scandal. ""All of these deaths are just too much . of a coincidence,""  Wanda Murray, a former Vistana board member,' told the Review Journal. 'None of them make sense to . any of us.' Amesbury, 57, a Las Vegas attorney, had pleaded guilty to mail fraud and bank fraud charges . Federal officials claim Amesbury received $3,000 from other conspirators to help rig homeowner board elections by creating fake ballots that would allow their candidate to win. Amesbury reached a deal with federal authorities on Oct. 24, pleading guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, according to U.S. Justice Department documents. Shortly after the plea agreement, Amesbury was found shirtless and with his pants at his ankles on a Henderson, Nevada, street. He had been severely beaten. 'He was really beaten to a pulp,' the source close to the investigation said. 'He had two broken ribs, and both his kneecaps were shattered. He also had a variety of facial injuries.' Amesbuey, who had 30 Valium pills on him at the time, told police officials that he 'planned to commit suicide or try to,' according to ABC News. Amesbury also admitted to prosecutors that he had previously participated in a separate scheme that involved defrauding banks while seeking refinancing as owner of a Clark County courthouse cafe. Quon and her former police officer boyfriend, William Ronald Webb Jr., were also fighting a legal battle against state prosecutors over criminal drug conspiracy, arson and insurance fraud charges, according to the Review Journal. Prosecutors say the two were involved in a botched arson-murder-suicide scheme that fell apart after Quon was found unconscious in her burning home in October 2010. Ten defendants have pleaded guilty in the homeowners association case so far, and prosecutors plan to name up to 20 new defendants soon, according to federal documents.","Attorney David Amesbury, 57, found hanged at brother's home .

"This map of Britain reveals the 'workshy' spots around the country where people claiming incapacity benefit claimants are actually fit enough to work. The Government introduced tough new health tests for those who claimed to be too unwell to get back into employment two years ago. Since then some 203,000, 30 per cent, out of 700,000 receiving the old Incapacity Benefit . were declared fit to find work. The Department for Work and . Pensions (DWP) said Birmingham had the biggest number of claimants capable of work. Of 14,640 claimants, 5,180 were fit.

In Glasgow, 3,950 of the 15,720 who received incapacity benefit were found to be well enough to work. And in both Liverpool and Manchester more than 3,000 are no longer eligible for the benefit. Mark Hoban, Minister for Employment, said they will now get long term help from Jobcentre Plus and the Work Programme to find work. He said: 'The old system condemned far too many people to a life on sickness benefits with little help to move back to work. 'This is a huge waste, but now people who can work will be given the long term help they need to find a job which is right for them, while those who need unconditional support will get it.' Incapacity Benefit has been replaced by Employment and Support Allowance as part of an overhaul of the welfare state spearheaded by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith. Under the old system people were allowed to claim incapacity for a variety of ailments such as acne or obesity. Hundreds of thousands are still waiting to be assessed by the system. The Government has said the new programme will support those who are genuinely unfit to work. It comes after it was revealed one million people who are fit to work have been claiming out-of-work benefits for three of the last four years. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said that more than four out of ten work-related benefits are claimed by the long-term unemployed. A third of those claiming incapacity benefit claimants are fit enough to work, it has today been revealed. It comes after an overhaul of the welfare state introduce by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith . Ministers have come under fire from Labour for capping total benefits at £26,000 a year per household and forcing those on Incapacity Benefit and its replacement Employment Support Allowance to undergo health tests to assess their readiness for work. TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: 'It’s tragic to see the Work and Pensions Secretary once again peddling myths about benefits in order to provide cover for more austerity and his own failure to tackle rising unemployment. 'The fact is that the majority of the million benefit claimants that he believes are ‘fit to work’ have either been declared not-yet fit-to-work by his own department, or are lone parents with children below school age, who will struggle to find work given the high cost of childcare. 'The Work and Pensions Secretary should spend less time wasting taxpayers’ money on bogus benefits propaganda and more time getting to grips with the real issue of rising unemployment, particularly the one million young people currently struggling for work.'","Birmingham has most claimants capable of work - 5,180 .

"For singletons, approaching strangers they’re attracted to in a public space can be nerve-wracking. After all, their personalities are a mystery - and they could have criminal tendencies. However, a new facial recognition app soon to be available for Android and iOS is claiming that it’s going to make life much easier for those in the dating game who’ve spotted someone they like while they’re out and about. Called NameTag, it blurs the lines between online and offline dating by allowing smartphone users to simply glance at someone nearby, or take their photo, and instantly see that person's name, occupation and even visit their Facebook, Instagram or Twitter profiles in real-time. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Appy days for daters? NameTag allows smartphone users to photograph strangers' faces to learn more about them .

FacialNetwork.com, the developer of NameTag, is also creating technology to allow the scanning of profile photos from dating sites such as PlentyOfFish.com, OkCupid.com and Match.com. For added peace of mind, the user can also cross-reference the photos against more than 450,000 entries in the National Sex Offender Registry and other criminal databases. Keeping it real: NameTag takes online dating offline . NameTag's creator Kevin Alan Tussy said: ‘I believe that this will make online dating and offline social interactions much safer and give us a far better understanding of the people around us. ‘It's much easier to meet interesting new people when we can simply look at someone, see their Facebook, review their LinkedIn page or maybe even see their dating site profile. Often we were interacting with people blindly or not interacting at all. NameTag can change all that.’ NameTag is currently available on Glass for Beta testers – meaning that the developer is letting people outside the company examine how it works to help iron out bugs and glitches. However, Google will not allow the app to be used for Glass beyond this as it contravenes its privacy rules. Tom Wiggins, Deputy Editor of tech mag Stuff, thinks the app is a good idea, but that users should exercise caution. He said: 'It could be very handy if you're not afraid of scaring people off with your creepy app. It's evidently pretty clever but I think most people would find it quite invasive. And isn't the point of dating to find out more about people? This kind of defeats the object.

"Pope Francis warned the 'idolatrous' global economic system 'cannot take it anymore' Pope Francis has launched a scathing attack on the global economic system, warning it is near collapse because of a 'throwaway culture' of greed and the 'atrocity' of youth unemployment. The Roman Catholic leader openly blasted the 'idolatrous' economy for disregarding the young, which he says has led to shocking levels of youth unemployment and will lead to a lost generation. The 77-year-old also criticised the economy - which he said had 'fallen into a sin of idolatry, the idolatry of money' - for surviving on the profits of war. The Pope's damning message came amid comments he made about the break-up of countries such as Scotland and Catalonia, which came as a huge blow to the Scottish Yes campaign. In an interview with Spanish newspaper La Vanguardia, he said: 'Our world cannot take it anymore. Our global economic system can’t take any more. 'We discard a whole generation to . maintain an economic system that no longer endures - a system that to . survive has to make war, as the big empires have always done. 'The economy is moved by the ambition of having more and, paradoxically, it feeds a throwaway culture.' The pontiff expressed particular concern over the 'worrisome' statistics of youth unemployment. He said: 'The rate of unemployment is very worrisome to me, which in some countries is over 50 percent. That is an atrocity. 'Young people are thrown . away when their natality is limited. The elderly are also discarded . because they don’t serve any use anymore. 'In throwing away the kids and . elderly, the future of a people is thrown away because the young people . are going to push forcefully forward and because the elderly give us . wisdom.' The pope said the high rate of youth unemployment was an 'atrocity' caused by the economy disregarding the younger - and older - generations . During the interview, Pope Francis - who . has not shied away from speaking out since he took over as the head of . the church - denounced the influence of war and the military on the . global economy. He said: 'Since we cannot wage the Third . World War, we make regional wars. And what does that mean? That we make . and sell arms. 'And with that the balance sheets of the idolatrous . economies -- the big world economies that sacrifice man at the feet of . the idol of money -- are obviously sorted. 'This unique thought takes away the wealth of diversity of thought and therefore the wealth of a dialogue between peoples.' 'Our global economic system can’t take any more. We discard a whole generation to . maintain an economic system that no longer endures' Pope Francis . The Pope said the economy's flaws had stemmed from humankind's obsession with money. He said: 'At the centre of all economic systems must be man, man and woman, and everything else must be in service of this man. 'But we have put money at the centre, the god of money. We have fallen into a sin of idolatry, the idolatry of money.' Pope Francis, who was elected in March 2013 . after the resignation of former Pope Benedict, has been trying to reform the finances of . the Vatican for the past year. Earlier this month, he sacked the five-man board of the Vatican's financial watchdog, the Financial Information Authority, to pave the way for drastic change. In the past, he has also made several public comments about the economy, most notably in November last year when he denounced 'the new idolatry of money' in a screed. He has also faulted the Catholic church for its negative obsession with homosexuals and birth control and has spoken out about climate change. In the same interview with the Spanish newspaper, he also touched on the issue of Scottish Independence. He said: ‘Independence of people through secession is a dismembering. Obviously, there are peoples with cultures so diverse that they cannot be connected. The Yugolsav case is very clear, but I wonder if it’s so clear in other cases, with other peoples who have been united up until now.’","Roman Catholic leader warned that the economy 'cannot take it anymore'

"Utah prosecutors announced Monday that officers were justified in fatally shooting a young man who was wielding a sword as part of a Japanese anime costume. Two Saratoga Springs officers feared for their lives and the safety of others in the bustling shopping center where the encounter occurred when they fired seven shots at 22-year-old Darrien Hunt September 10, Utah County Attorney Jeff Buhman said Monday in a news conference. The shooting has prompting accusations from Hunt's family that he was treated differently because of his race and that his actions didn't warrant deadly force. Hunt was black and the two officers are white. Shot dead: Utah prosecutors announced Monday that officers were justified in fatally shooting 22-year-old Darrien Hunt on September 10 . Exhibit A: Utah County Attorney Bureau of Investigations Bureau Chief Jeff Robinson holds the sword carried by Darrien Hunt as Utah County Attorney Jeffrey Buhman addresses the media Monday . The Hunt family plan to file a civil rights and wrongful death lawsuit, said attorney Bob Sykes, who told reporters Monday that a jury would disagree the finding that the shooting was justified. The fatal encounter was triggered by somebody calling in a report of a suspicious person walking with a sword in Saratoga Springs, a middle-class city south of Salt Lake City. Police Cpl. Matthew Schauerhamer and Officer Nicholas Judson spotted Hunt and began having a normal conversation with him, Buhman said. Hunt said he wanted a ride to a nearby city but when they asked him to give up his sword, he refused and his demeanor changed. That's when he swung the 3-foot metal sword at them, Buhman said. 'This happened so quickly, violently and without provocation the officers had to use what was most immediately available to them, which was their firearms,' Buhman said. He said the investigation uncovered no trace that race or ethnicity played a role in the incident. The findings of the investigation were based on interviews with the officers involved and three witnesses, he said. Buhman said after Hunt was initially hit by gunfire, he fled and disobeyed orders to drop the sword. 'It would have been a matter of seconds before he could have reached someone else,' he said. Sykes disputed that account, saying it was unlikely that Hunt was aggressive. Officers stand at the scene of the September 10 shooting in Saratoga Springs. Police deny Hunt's race had anything to do with the shooting . Heartbroken: Susan Hunt, pictured here holding a family portrait depicting her son Darrien (second right), plans to file a civil rights and wrongful death lawsuit. She said Darrien wouldn've been shot were he white like her . 'I think it's a whitewash. I think it's an exaggeration. I think they ignored good hard evidence to the contrary,' he said. The Hunt family hope a lawsuit would bring changes in police training, he said. 'So many young men and young women are being shot down and killed by police officers improperly using deadly force,' he said. He said the sword Hunt used was decorative, but Buhman argued could have hurt someone. At the news conference in Provo, officials showed the narrow, metal, 3-foot long sword. 'The tip is sharp and the blade, maybe it's not sharpened to Ginsu or chef standards, but it's sharp enough to cut,' Buhman said. 'It is not dulled.' Investigators don't know why Hunt had the sword or swung it at officers, Buhman said. A search warrant released last week showed that Hunt had been fired from his job after he didn't come to work, and his mother had told him he needed to get a job or leave the house by the end of the week. Armed: Officials argued that Hunt's narrow, metal, 3-foot long sword was sharp enough to hurt someone . Unanswered questions: Utah County Attorney Jeff Buhman said Investigators don't know why Hunt had the sword or swung it at officers . His brother told investigators Hunt had been making and using a hallucinogenic drug and was 'obsessed' with a girl on Facebook who wasn't interested in him, according to the warrant filed in state court. The morning of his death, a friend said he posted a message on Facebook saying, 'I have a sword and I'm going to get shot,' investigators wrote. An autopsy shows Hunt didn't have drugs in his system when he died of multiple gunshot wounds, including several to the back of his body. Saratoga Springs Police Chief Andrew Burton said in a statement he's pleased with the findings, while recognizing that the ruling may not bring closure to the Hunt family. 'It is our hope that the community can now move forward in the healing process,' Burton said.","Darrien Hunt, 22, was gunned down by two Saratoga Springs police officers September 10 .

"A 'Star Trek' assistant that can translate any language, answer any question, and never needs to be taken out of your pocket has been hailed as Google's future by one of its leading engineers. Amit Singhal, Google vice-president and senior search engineer, and the man who wrote the firm's search algorithm, said that the company has been inspired by sci-fi series Star Trek to develop the 'ubiquitous computing' concept, where gadgets woven into users' daily lives seamlessly respond to questions. 'Why should someone stop their conversation because they're missing a tiny piece of information that you need to take that conversation further?' said Mr Singhal. Scroll down for video . Google Glass, the firm's augmented reality glasses, is set to firm an integral part of Google's plans for a computer that is always connected, yet never needs to be taken out of a user's pocket. 'You have to pull out your phone, you have to unlock the phone, you have to type -  Already you have lost valuable seconds and the conversation has become unnatural and awkward. 'I would make a bold prediction that in the next three to five years you will have a Star Trek assistant, with a lot more capability than your phone has now. 'We have built baby steps of this already. 'In future, answers to questions could be delivered to users through devices for the living room and kitchen appliances that respond to spoken commands. 'What if I ask a question and the answer pops up, on my Google Glasses or on the TV or maybe even on the family refrigerator?"" he said. 'Then we can go on with the conversation. 'It will make the conversation richer. Zoe Schoon from Christie's auction rooms, London, displays a Tricorder Prop from Insurrection, a Star Trek film. The iconic TV show predicted a range of technologies which are already being developed, such as universal translation and advanced medical scanners. It featured replicators, which can make a perfect copy of anything - not unlike the 3D printers that are already available and expected to become commonplace. Ships in the series often used cloaking devices to shield themselves from prying enemy eyes - a technology which is slowly becoming reality. The show also predicted the emergence of smartphones - with the famous 'tricorder' being a handheld, internet connected computer. It also featured human-like robots, which are already being used in some environments, and are expected to become common[place in the coming years. However, many more of Star Trek's inventions,  including 'warp speed' space travel and teleportation are yet to arrive. However, earlier this year, Nature reported that photons had been teleported 89 miles, between La Palma and Tenerife in a groundbreaking experiment that could one day lead to the iconic phrase 'Beam me up, Scotty,' being used for real. Singhal, who describes his job as 'being in charge of the world's . search', has previously said he has a simple dream - to built the Star Trek . communicator he saw on his family's black-and-white TV while growing up . in India. 'The key to this is when you can have a . Star Trek Googlephone, where you can say, 'Google, tell me how Alfred . Nobel made his money?,' he told the Evening Standard. 'You can seek any knowledge on demand. 'How much more productive would . humanity be if we can achieve this? 'Today I feel more excited about my . dream, it is almost within grasp,"" says Singhal. However, Google is not the only firm hoping to develop a personal assistant. Apple's iPhone assistant Siri can perform many functions of the mobile phone - including sending text messages - simply by responding to the user's voice. The iPhone and iPad maker also has a patent on a head-mounted display system using a pair of glasses fitted with small screens. Mr Singhal said that there were still hurdles to overcome, and that computers will need to understand the intricacies of conversational speech. He gave the example of a discussion of football, with someone asking 'How are they doing?'. While a computer would be baffled, humans understand it refers to the team. The inspiration for Google Glass? Star Trek's Lt Geordi La Forge. Today the firm said Star Trek is the inspiration behind much of its work.","Firm hopes to make its head mounted Google Glass project part of vision .

"The average house in the UK now costs £250,000, after doubling in just 12 years. It means half of buyers now have to pay 3 per cent stamp duty, raising fears about the impact on the property market. Prices in London are up more than 13 per cent in a year, but outside the capital and the South East there was a more modest rise of only 3.8 per cent. The average UK house price hit £254,000 in January, while prices in London topped £450,000 . London is powering ahead of the rest of the country, with prices up 13.2 per cent in a year . In a further blow to those struggling to get on the property ladder, prices are rising faster for first-time buyers as demand for starter homes outstrips supply. In particular, the government's Help to Buy scheme aimed at people wanting to own their first home, has seen thousands of people flood the market, driving up prices. In January prices for those buying their first home were up 7.6 per cent, compared with 6.5 per cent for owner-occupiers, the Office for National Statistics said. House prices grew by 7.1 per cent in England, 6.9 per cent in Wales, 1.4 per cent in Scotland and 2.7 per cent in Northern Ireland. The average price in the UK now stands at £254,000. In England the average home costs £264,000, £166,000 in Wales, £132,000 in Northern Ireland and £183,000 in Scotland. The ONS said: ‘London continues to be the English region with the highest average house price at £458,000 and the North East had the lowest average house price at £147,000. ‘London, the South East and the East of England all had prices higher than the UK average price of £254,000. ‘Excluding London and the South East, the average UK mix-adjusted house price was £196,000.’ House prices are now well above the pre-crash peak, raising fears of a new bubble . In January 2014 the average price paid . for a house by a first-time buyer was £190,000, while people already on . the property ladder paid £291,000. It also emerged today that in February mortgage lending leapt by around 50 on a year ago. High street banks said they had seen rising confidence and a broadening appetite for loans. Gross . mortgage borrowing of £11.5 billion recorded during the month was 47 . per cent higher than in February 2013 and at the highest level since . August 2008, according to the British Bankers' Association (BBA). Some . 47,550 mortgages worth £7.7 billion were approved for people buying a . home last month, which is a 53 per cent increase on the same month last . year, the BBA's report said. The . latest number of approvals for house purchase is slightly down on a . six-year high of over 49,000 recorded in January, but it is still the . second highest monthly figure recorded since October 2007. The BBA said that mortgage support schemes are continuing to free up more housing chains and prompt further bursts in activity. Average rises of 6.8 per cent are the highest for three years, but still below peaks seen in 2010 . The Help to Buy scheme was launched last year to help credit-worthy people to move on or up the housing ladder with deposits as low as 5 per cent. The Government announced last week that the first phase of Help to Buy, which is an equity loan scheme launched last spring to specifically support people buying a new-build home, will be extended to the end of the decade. BBA chief economist Richard Woolhouse said: ‘These encouraging figures show that the demand for finance is broadening out across both the consumer and commercial markets, with mortgage approvals and lending to many types of business on the up. ‘Mortgage lending has leapt 50 per cent since this time last year, whilst we are now beginning to see growth in net lending to manufacturers and retailers. ‘This shows that the banks are helping businesses who are looking to invest as well as ordinary home buyers as part of their sustained support for recovery across the economy.’","Prices in January were 6.8% higher than in 2013, new figures show .

"With no political experience and little knowledge of economics, performing arts professor Vladimir Franz was already an unlikely candidate for the Czech Republic presidential election. The fact that 90 per cent of his body is covered in tattoos makes it even more surprising that not only is he standing for election - he currently stands third in the polls. One in nine voters are believed to be planning on backing the 53-year-old opera composer and painter in this weekend's presidential elections after a £15,000 election campaign that didn't even include posters. Scroll down for video . Avatar kingmaker: Professor Vladimir Franz is third in line in the run-up to the Czech presidential elections - despite little to no political experience and a body covered in tattoos . He's tipped to win around 11 per cent in the first round of votes on Friday and Saturday, which is not enough to go through, but may make him kingmaker. Leading candidates Jan Fischer and Milos Zeman, both former prime ministers, ought to be keen to benefit from his following if the vote goes to a second round. And Mr Franz, a Professor at Prague's Academy of Performing Arts, is not short of admirers. In a country where voters are increasingly tired of corrupt politicians who, they say, fail to keep promises more than two decades after the fall of communism, Mr Franz's agenda of promoting human rights, democracy and green energy policies has made an impact. ‘The (political) system is so enchanted with itself that it has lost the ability to self-reflect,’ he said in an interview yesterday. 'Czechs are fed up with this c**p.’ Double figures: Vladimir Franz, seen smiling prior to a rehearsal of his opera 'War with the Newts' at the State Opera in Prague, Czech Republic yesterday, is predicted 11 per cent in the first round of voting this weekend . Competition: Both Jan Fischer, left, and Milos Zeman, right, are former prime ministers of the Czech Republic . Mr Franz says he only threw his hat in . the ring after a group of admirers established the Franz for President . initiative and begged him to shake up the race through his shock factor. But he's stirred up such goodwill that a leading economist offered his . services for free and his campaign workers are also volunteers. He's only spent £15,575 ($25,000) from donations on his campaign and hasn't put up any posters. Changes; Vladimir Franz says Czechs are fed up with the current political system . Franz burst onto the political scene with an eye-catching 88,000 signatures from the public at the end of 2012 - far more than the 50,000 required by law. Not affiliated with any party, he has campaigned mostly on a platform highlighting graft, the importance of education and the nation's moral standing. He's proven particularly popular with young voters - and those not yet eligible to cast a ballot. In a mock presidential election at 441 high schools across the country a month before the vote, Franz won by a landslide, garnering more than 40 per cent of some 60,000 votes. And, perhaps surprisingly, few take issue with his tattoos. ‘Personally, . I wouldn't vote for him - but (the tattoos) are not a problem at all,’ said Tomas Pistora, a 33-year-old IT specialist from Prague. ‘The young . people prefer him because they don't have a better choice.’ ‘The . tattoo doesn't make any difference,’ said Jakub Fisera, a student in . Prague, adding a lack of experience in politics was more an issue. For the first time, the Czech . president will be elected in a popular vote - a new system that makes it . possible for independent candidates like Franz to run for the largely . ceremonial post. Vaclav . Klaus, the incumbent, opposed the change, calling it ‘a fatal mistake’ and said he feared the likes of Franz might succeed him. A total of nine candidates are . running. Unlike the Euro-skeptic Klaus who attacked the EU at every . opportunity, the favorites, Zeman and Fischer, have a more moderate . approach to the bloc which the country joined in 2004. Zeman, the leftist premier in 1998-02, . leads the polls with about 25 per cent support. Fischer, a centrist and . a former state bureaucrat, gained significant popularity when he led a . caretaker government in 2009-10. He polls at about 20 per cent. Back to basics: Classical music composer, painter and opera singer Vladimir Franz has little knowledge of economics, but promotes human rights, democracy and renewable energy . Disapproval: Incumbent president Vaclav Klaus called the introduction of a popular vote and allowing independent candidates such as Mr Franz, was a 'fatal mistake' As . the campaign approached its end on Tuesday, eight candidates were busy drumming up votes. The ninth - Franz - had other matters to deal with: a . final rehearsal of his opera, War With The Newts, at the State Opera. Torn between art and politics, Franz cut short his appearance at an election debate to return to the opera house that is part of Prague's National Theater. But he committed to staying to the end of Thursday's final televised debate. It wasn't an easy choice, but he realized his credibility demanded that he take part. ‘For a Czech composer to have a world premiere in the National Theater is something extraordinary. I had to make a choice between a service to the public and the fulfillment of my life-long dream. I've made the choice and will be at the debate.’","Tattooed presidential candidate Vladimir Franz may become kingmaker .

"Search teams looking for two missing airmen from a Turkish jet shot down by Syrian forces have discovered two helmets - but have yet to find the pilots themselves. The Turkish F4 air force jet was shot down by Syrian authorities over the Mediterranean Sea last week in an act which has escalated tensions between the two countries. After Syria admitted shooting the plane down for flying 'over Syrian territorial waters', investigators have found two helmets and two pairs of boots in the wreckage, but are yet to recover the pilots dead or alive. Missing: An F4 Phantom Turkish fighter jet was shot down by Syrian security forces yesterday over 'Syrian territorial waters' Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said no parachutes have been found but the flyers' boots were discovered days before. Experts have speculated that the two pilots could have ejected from the plane after it was hit - but that they would not have survived the wind blast if they did so. Former fighter pilot and ABC News Consultant Steve Ganyard told ABC the plane which was hit was likely to have been a reconnaissance F-4 Pantom fighter, capable of flying at over twice the speed of sound. Mr Ganyard told ABC the pilots would have died instantly in the wind blast from ejecting from the plane, or would have been killed on impact when the aircraft hit the water 'as if it were concrete'. Unclear: Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said there has been no confirmation of what happened to the two pilots . Turkey and Syria continue to argue about what led to the F4 jet being shot out of the sky in the first place. The Turkish government wrote a letter to the UN earlier this week, claiming the unarmed plane had been flying in international airspace when it suddenly came under fire from Syrian air defenses. The letter stated that after being hit, the Turkish plane turned into Syrian airspace before crashing. Turkey has since promised to respond 'determinedly' after the Syrian military admitted shooting down the warplane. A day after the letter was sent, a top Syrian official told the Syrian State News Agency the aircraft had 'blatantly' violated the country's airspace, adding that the shooting was a defensive and sovereign act. Jihad Makdessi, a spokesperson for Syria's Foreign and Expatriates Ministry, said the jet had gone deep into Syrian airspace before it triggered an automatic air defense system. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan last week led a two-hour security meeting on the crisis. In a statement issued after the meeting, the government said it 'will determinedly take necessary steps' in response, without saying what they would be. It comes after the Syrian military confirmed it had brought down the plane over the eastern part of the sea, southwest of the Turkish province of Hatay, which borders Syria. 'Our air defences confronted a target that penetrated our air space over our territorial waters pre-afternoon on Friday and shot it down,' a statement by the military circulated on state media said. 'It turned out to be a Turkish military plane.' Defection: The host of top Syrian army officials have turned up in Turkey . The incident threatens to worsen relations between the two countries, which have already become strained in recent months. Turkey has joined nations such as the US in saying that Syrian President Bashar Assad should step down because of the uprising in his country. Turkey also has set up refugee camps on its border for more than 32,000 Syrians who have fled the fighting. Erdogan confirmed that the plane went down some eight miles (13km) from the Syrian town of Latakia over the Mediterranean Sea. Left: The F4 Phantom jet had taken off from Erhac airport in the eastern province of Malatya shortly before all contact with the aircraft was lost last week (file picture) Continued protests: Demonstrators protest against Syria's President Bashar Assad in Dael near Deraa . He said: 'Four of our gunboats and some Syrian gunboats are carrying out a joint search there.' Ilter Turan, a professor of political science at Istanbul's Bilgi University, told NTV that Syria's action was clearly 'hostile,' even if it violated its air space. 'They could have either sent their planes to confront it or force it to land, it is a hostile act by any standard,' Turan said. Turan, however, predicted that Syria will try to avoid escalating tensions further . This latest incident could further threaten relations between the two countries already at bitter odds over a 16-month-old revolt against Assad. Syria and Turkey have expelled each other's ambassadors and Syria has accused Turkey of supporting Syrian opposition and even allowing Syrian rebels to operate out of Turkish soil.","Investigators also find two pairs of boots in wreckage .

"President Barack Obama is moving ahead with his push to close the Guantanamo Bay prison despite the uproar over the exchange of five Taliban prisoners for a captured American soldier, an administration official said Thursday. The Periodic Review Board has determined that more former 'forever prisoners,' including one who says he has been reformed by practicing yoga and another who was a bodyguard for Bin Laden but now wants to start a 'milk and honey farm' are fit for release to their homelands or repatriation. Ghaleb Nasser al Bihani, 35, told a . parole board in April that he had read the biographies of Dr Martin . Luther King Jr and the Dalai Lama and aspired to live 'an ordinary . life.' Scroll down for video . Imminent release: In this photo reviewed by a U.S. Department of Defense official, a prisoner walks through a communal pod inside an area of Guantanamo Bay known as Camp 6, an area for prisoners who are considered 'highly compliant' with the rules on Saturday, June 7, 2014 . Intelligence compiled for the board described Bihani, a Yemeni, as a troublemaker in the prison who showed 'ill intentions to the U.S.' and was 'almost certainly' a trained former member of al-Qaeda whose own brothers were jihadists with the group, reports the Miami Herald. His lawyer says that he was only an assistant cook for a group that was affiliated with the Taliban and no longer exists. Slated for release: Ghaleb Nasser al Bihani is now a yoga practitioner who aspires to 'live a normal life' upon his release . He suffers diabetes, says the lawyer, and needs medical care. Bihani now practices yoga and reads self-help books, and wants to start a family when he is released, he told the board. He plans to distance himself from family members who are known to be extremists. Mahmud Abd al Mujahid, 33, another Yemeni, has also been cleared for transfer. According to the New York Post, his lawyer described the suspected Osama bin Laden bodyguard as 'a peacemaker' who 'requires no rehabilitation' when he is returned to Yemen. A detainee who was called as a character witness told the board that Mujahid wants to start a milk and honey farm. Mujahid told the board that as a child, 'we were taught politeness, respect and human being [sic].' Ali Ahmad al-Razihi, 33, is suspected of having been part of what U.S. intelligence officials called the 'Dirty 30' security detail around bin Laden, a founder of al Qaeda who was killed in 2011 by U.S. forces in Pakistan. He told the board that he plans to focus on returning to Yemen, marrying and helping with the family fruit and vegetable business. His representative described him as 'a peaceful man,' and the board cited his 'positive attitude,' but a profile by the Defense Department said he has been uncooperative and has avoided interviews since 2010. He was captured in 2001 while he fled bin Laden's hideout in Tora Bora, Afghanistan. In 2010, a parole board recommended he remain in prison. Making plans: Mahmud Abd al Mujahid (left) wants to start his own milk and honey farm while Ali Ahmad al-Razihi wants to help in his family's fruit and vegetable business . The White House official said a 'significant number' of prisoners are on their way toward release, but he declined to say precisely how many or when they would leave Guantanamo. The remarks were made on condition of anonymity amid fierce criticism in Congress over the decision to swap the five Taliban for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. The U.S. holds 149 men at Guantanamo. Most have been there without charge since the detention center opened in January 2002 to hold prisoners suspected of links to al-Qaida or the Taliban. Among the total are 78 who have been cleared for transfer to their homeland or repatriation to another country if the U.S. can get required security assurances. Obama came into office pledging to close the detention center within a year but was thwarted by Congress, which adopted restrictions on transfers abroad and a ban on transferring prisoners to the United States for any reason. Last year, Congress eased the restrictions on transfers abroad but left in place a 30-day notice requirement that the Obama administration chose to skip in exchange for rescuing Bergdahl from captivity after five years. Exchange: President Barack Obama shakes hands with Bob Bergdahl as Jani Bergdahl stands at left, during a news conference in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington about the release of their son, U.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl in exchange for five enemy combatants . Several Republicans in Congress are determined to keep Guantanamo open and bar Obama from transferring any prisoners. Senator Kelly Ayotte, a Republican from New Hampshire who is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a chief proponent of keeping the prison operational, said the Bergdahl swap represents a 'real-case example' that she and other lawmakers can use in arguing for tougher restrictions on Guantanamo detainees. She said Bergdahl's case highlights 'the risk that we take when we're transferring high-risk detainees to third-party nationals that we can't necessarily account for their security and ability to get back into the fight.' Another member of the committee, Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, has said he will introduce legislation next week to prohibit any transfers from Guantanamo until Congress learns more about the Bergdahl case.","78 Guantanamo inmates have been cleared for transfer to .

"Denied: Kayla Reyes claims that when she interviewed for a position at Macy's she was told that her service in the Army made her ill-suited for the job . A 21-year-old Afghanistan veteran claims she was denied a job in Macy's specifically because of her service in the war-torn nation. Kayla Reyes says she interviewed for a job on the sales floor at Fresno's Fashion Fair mall in February but was told that she wouldn't be able to relate to customers because she had seen combat. Reyes, who enlisted in the military at the age of 17, claims that the interview took a turn for the worse when her 4-year army career came up and that the hiring manager said, 'Being that you've been over there, you wouldn't really know how to approach people.' Stunned, Reyes said the manager continued and said that having spent a year dealing with IED's and the Taliban, 'Once a customer's in your face, you wouldn't know how to do it. You wouldn't know how to react.' Collecting herself, Reyes said that when she realized the hiring manager had serious misconceptions, she tried to object. However, Reyes said that instead of listening, the Macy's manager insisted that a role in store security was probably better suited for her. 'She's like, 'Well I've been here 15 years, I know you wouldn't be able to do good here.' She's like, 'There's another job in loss prevention,' and she was like, 'That's what you're good for--that's what you do,' Reyes said to CBS. Scroll Down for Video . California: Reyes has said that when she applied for a job at Fresno's Fashion Fair mall in February the interviewing manager said that an army career did not mean she was qualified for a sales position on the floor . Having returned from her deployment to enlist in the National Guard, Reyes said that she was disappointed by her treatment and took to Facebook to share her experience. 'It kind of shocked me because I'm with her almost every day. I talk to her on a daily basis, and she's the most social person I know,' said Justine Williams, Reyes's best friend, in reaction to the response Reyes received. Her update was shared tens of thousands of times and Reyes received messages of support from across the country. Macy's released a statement regarding the incident last month. 'Employing veterans is a priority at Macy’s, and we have proudly hired thousands to work within our stores and corporate organization,' said Betsy Nelson, Macy's vice president of media. 'Our commitment to veterans is strong, as we recognize that veterans possess leadership skills that we find are essential in a dynamic department store environment. 'Ms. Reyes’ application for a position with Macy’s is, in fact, still under consideration as we continue to consider the types of retail jobs that may be available. 'We are actively looking for an appropriate open position that would be best suited for her skills and experience level, as we do with all prospective employees.' Discrimination? Reyes took to Facebook to express her frustration and the posting was shared thousands of times - leading to a response from Macy's . Service: Kayla Reyes joined the army when she was 17 and recently . returned to civilian life and attempted to apply for a job at Macy's in . Fresno . Reyes claims that a Macy's representative contacted after her story was shared across the Internet and offered her job. However, Reyes claims that she turned the job down and accepted a position with the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. At a Fresno military recruitment office, Navy veteran Megan Newman told CBS that those with army experience have many transferable skills. 'They set you up to guide employers and see you not just as a member of the military but as someone with transferable experience,' said Newman. Seeking to clarify the situation, Macy's posted again on Friday to their own Facebook page to deny discrimination against Reyes. Afghan veteran: When Macy's executives discovered that they may have inadvertently offended a member of the military they offered Reyes (seen here in Afghanistan) a job. She turned them down . 'As a company that stands for inclusion in the workplace and our stores, we do not tolerate discrimination of any kind. 'We proudly employ thousands of veterans within our organization, as we know that veterans possess leadership skills that are an asset in a dynamic department store environment. 'As with any prospective employee, we actively looked for appropriate and available positions that would be best suited for Ms. Reyes’ skills and experience level, and, in fact, identified and offered her a job at our store. We were disappointed when she declined.' Reyes replied to this stating, 'Correct. A few weeks after the interview and after this story went viral, I did receive an email for a job there. 'I was very respectful in my response to them. I did not feel comfortable working in a store where a job was offered to me because of the way this has all turned out.

'This year, we’re looking forward to . turning iPlayer into an entertainment destination, with a relentless . focus on making iPlayer as easy and enjoyable as television.' A separate study of UK viewing habits, by broadbandchoices.co.uk, revealed a third of the 2,000 people polled (33 per cent) would rather watch programmes on a tablet, smart-phone or laptop than on a traditional television set. Researchers also found more than a third of adults watch catch-up TV online, while a quarter watched less TV on a standard set in 2012 than in 2002. And experts predict that within five years the ordinary television set will be replaced as the primary viewing device in most British homes thanks to the rise of 'on demand' TV. The survey also revealed more than one in four of those polled (26 per cent) watch less TV through a standard telly than they did 10 years ago. Recent Ofcom statistics highlight that traditional television viewing among 25 to 34-year-olds fell from an average of 3.5 hours to 3.3 hours per day from 2005 to 2011. On-demand availability has been a major factor in the shift away from traditional telly habits, with an increasing number of viewers choosing to catch up online and not be dictated to by a rigid TV schedule. More than a third of UK adults with home internet (37 per cent) now watch online catch-up TV - a leap of 14 per cent compared with just three years ago, while one in five adults says they now watch catch-up TV at least once a week. The survey found that Brits are actually watching an average of 90 minutes extra video, film and television content a day than they were 10 years ago - more than 500 hours a year. Dominic Baliszewski, telecoms expert at broadbandchoices.co.uk, said: 'It’s not surprising that the old-fashioned television is losing its crown as king of the living room. 'With so many different ways for people to view films and programmes over a broadband connection, modern devices such as tablets allow viewers far more flexibility to choose where and when they watch their favourite shows. 'We could see the ordinary TV set replaced in most homes as the primary viewing device in less than five years. 'The ability to stream and download content has changed the landscape of home entertainment and put the end viewer in charge of their entertainment schedule.

"The electric car being showcased as a replacement for horse-drawn carriage rides in New York's Central Park has been revealed. The Horseless eCarriage, a classic looking motor with leather seats, running boards and green livery, was shown off at the New York International Auto Show on Thursday. Although it is advocated as a humane alternative to the horses that have been taking tourists round the park for decades, the eCarriage has not yet won over critics. Horseless carriage: The electric car, designed to look like a classic motor, is being offered as an alternative . The prototype of the car was commissioned by campaign group NYCLASS, which claims horse-drawn carriage rides in such a busy city are cruel. The group's proposed alternative is an open-top car that can seat eight people and is made to look like it is from the early 20th Century, with plenty of brass trimmings and over-sized wheels. Its creator, Jason Wenig of car restoration business The Creative Workshop, said the selling price could be between $150,000 and $175,000. Wenig called the car 'a homage' to an earlier time, with a body shape that 'reflects and celebrates an era that's of amazing historical significance to this city'. But before the cars could make their way to the streets around Central Park, legislation banning the carriage horses would have to be passed. Parp! Parp!: The brass trimmings and green livery make the eCarriage look like something Toad of Wind in the Willows would drive . Crafted: Dials and knobs on the dashboard are in keeping with the classical theme . Mayor Bill de Blasio wants to ban the . horses. But carriage-horse operators and their allies - including actor . Liam Neeson - have opposed the plan, and the council has not yet . introduced the legislation. Neeson, who has lived in the city for 20 . years, defended the 'proud' workers and their spotless . record for looking after their animals. In . a strongly-worded piece in the New York Times recently, he stated that . 'an entire way of life and a historic industry are under threat'. The . actor went on to defend the safety record of the handlers and their . horses, saying: 'New York’s horse carriages have made an estimated six . million trips in traffic over the last 30 years. 'In that time, just four horses have been killed as a result of collisions with motor vehicles, with no human fatalities.' Driver's seat: Jason Wenig designed the eCarriage for NYCLASS which is campaigning to ban horses from Central Park . Iconic: The eCarriage was designed to evoke an historically important era in New York City . The Central Park Conservancy, a nonprofit that oversees the park in partnership with the city, was also against the idea of bringing more cars into the popular place. 'Forty million people visit Central Park each year, including runners, bicyclists, kids and dog owners,' Doug Blonsky, president and chief executive of the conservancy, said. 'Adding vehicles to the mix will make the park less safe for all of them and increase congestion.' Wenig said the cars would be able to go up to 30mph outside of the park, but would be kept electronically from going more than 5mph inside it. Asked about the conservancy's opposition, de Blasio said he thought it was a 'misunderstanding' of what's being proposed. Controversial: Mayor Bill de Blasio's campaign to end horse-drawn carriage rides has met criticism . Moving on: Those backing the campaign say the eCarriage, which will not travel faster than 5mph, is a safer and more humane way to take in views of the park . 'Right now, besides the fact that the horse carriages are not humane - there have been a number of accidents involving carriages - the routes we're talking about would be the same as our existing routes,' he said. 'You're talking about electric cars for tourists that go slow on purpose because they should go slow and because tourists want to see things. 'That's very different from other issues about cars in parks, and it is a cleaner, better, more humane approach, that obviously will also provide employment opportunities and will be good for our tourism industry.' He had previously called the rides cruel and outdated, and said they should no longer be 'a part of the . landscape of New York City'. City Councilmember Daniel Dromm said legislation was still being crafted, with the specifics of how those who hold licenses for the carriage horses could get the vehicles and how it would be paid for still to be determined. He insisted there were enough votes for legislation to pass.","Prototype of electric motor was on show at New York's Auto Show .

"A rare dummy parachuted into occupied Europe to bamboozle the Germans on D-Day and draw their forces from the actual invasion has been found in a garden shed. At least 500 of the 3ft stunt puppets were dropped along with SAS soldiers at four spots away from the Normandy beaches to take the enemy away from genuine drop zones. Sent in the middle of the night, these canvas 'paradummies' - nicknamed Ruperts - were designed to burst into flames when they landed so the Germans could not find them. But one has survived combat and has been . discovered at the bottom of a British garden along with some once top . secret maps and documents. Rare finds: A dummy parachutist that was one of 500 dropped over France on D-Day to confuse the enemy has been found in a garden shed with a number of maps, documents and artefacts . Six SAS soldiers were parachuted in . with the dolls, with equipment playing the sounds of a loud battle to make . the subterfuge even more realistic. Although they were half the size of a human, they would have . appeared lifelike to those looking up from the ground on a dark night. Meanwhile thousands of Allied airmen . landed elsewhere during the early hours of June 6, 1944, . ahead of the invasion from the Channel. The 'paradummy' was discovered at the bottom of a garden along . with a set of RAF maps for a team tasked with spotting the results of . the Royal Naval . bombardment of the German defences on D-Day. Subterfuge: 500 of the dolls were dropped into France on the night of June 6, 1944 at the time of the Allied landing in Normandy . Skillful: The dummies fell in areas away from the beaches and genuine drop zones used on D-Day (pictured) to draw away German forces . Inspiration: These dolls were featured in The Longest Day (pictured), a 1962 hit film about the D-Day landings . The artefacts were found by . a woman who was clearing out her late grandparents' belongings and it . is not known how the item made its way back from Normandy to Britain. The Allies tried all they could to confuse the enemy on D-Day and used top secret inventions to gain the upper hand. On the eve of battle planes flew back and forth across the Channel to drop bundles of 'window', now known as chaff, to disrupt enemy radar. Just ten bombers used the technique to make the enemy believe hundreds of 'ghost' aircraft were above them. The bombers then jammed German radio over Northern France to hide the 1,000 aircraft that were on their way to drop parachutists behind enemy lines. When the beach landings happened men used rocket-propelled grappling hooks attached to ropes and ladders to climb the steep Normandy cliffs in minutes rather than hours. They were then followed by 'Donald Duck' Sherman tanks, which floated and used the engine to drive through water and up onto the beaches. Kevin . King, of Buckinghamshire-based auctioneers Marlow's which has sold it . for £900 said: 'It is quite rare to come across previously . unknown paradummies now. 'Back in the 1970s a whole batch of them were found on an airfield and some of them are in museums now. 'The woman vendor was having a bit of a clear out of her grandfather's shed when she found it.' The deception, known as 'Operation Titanic', did draw German . troops away from the Normandy beaches. The Ruperts were made from hessian cloth and would have been filled with sand and straw at the time. They featured in the famous 1962 D-Day movie The Longest Day. Mr King said: 'If the paradummies were any bigger than not that many of them would have fitted on the aircrafts. 'When . an object is high up in the air it is very difficult to get a proper . perspective of it from the ground, especially in darkness.' During the war the Americans also dropped their own dummies and called them Oscars. It was an idea stolen from the Germans, who had used the technique when it attacked the Netherlands in 1940. They have also been used in the Vietnam war as well as the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.","500 dolls were dropped to draw Germans from beaches and drop zones .

"Apple has joined the likes of Facebook and Google by releasing figures showing how many times governments around the world have requested personal information about its customers. From 1 January to 30 June this year there were almost 3,000 data requests made from 31 countries - with the U.S and UK topping the list. Apple said the most common requests related to ‘robberies and other crimes’, requests from law enforcement agencies searching for missing people or hoping to prevent a suicide, and data about the owners of lost or stolen phones. From 1 January to 30 June this year there were almost 3,000 data requests made from 31 countries. This table shows the countries that requested data, listed in alphabetical order. The U.S has forbidden Apple from declaring exact figures, but the tech giant said it received up to 2,000 requests across various states . 1. U.S - between 1,000 and 2,000 requests about 2,000 to 3,000 accounts . 2. UK - 127 requests about 141 accounts. Amount granted: 37 per cent . 3. Spain - 102 requests about 104 accounts.

The firms said it assesses every data request it receives ‘carefully’ and did not grant all requests for information it received in the first half of this year. The U.S has forbidden Apple from declaring exact figures, but the California-based tech giant said it received between 1,000 and 2,000 requests from law enforcements across various states. It granted between zero and 1,000 of these requests. The UK made 127 requests for personal information concerning a total of 141 accounts. Only 37 per cent of these were granted. Third place went to Spain with 102 requests made about 104 accounts, with 22 per cent of these granted. Surprisingly, Germany – renowned for its strong stance on privacy – was in fourth place asking for information about 93 accounts and receiving data on six per cent. According to the report, responding to an account request usually involved providing information about an account holder’s iTunes or iCloud account, such as a name and address. Apple said in very rare cases it was asked to provide stored photos or email and considered each request on a case-by-case basis.

Germany   2,068                 37 per cent . France     1,598                  39 per cent . Countries not featured in the report have not not made any requests to Apple for personal customer information. Apple, along with other technology companies, is only allowed to report data request numbers in increments of 1,000 in the U.S. The figures must also be a mixture of law enforcement and national security requests, making it impossible to know exactly how many are security-related. The company registered its opposition to these rules earlier this week: ‘We feel strongly that the government should lift the gag order and permit companies to disclose complete and accurate numbers regarding FISA (Federal Intelligence Surveillance Act) requests and National Security Letters,’ Apple said in its report. 'We will continue to aggressively pursue our ability to be more transparent.’ Responding to an account request involved providing information about an account holder's iTunes or iCloud account, pictured. Apple said that in very rare cases it was asked to provide stored photos or email and considered each of these requests on a case-by-case basis . Tech companies are keen to push for, or at least be seen to be pushing for, transparency in their dealings with U.S. intelligence agencies. Facebook published its first . Transparency Report in August which revealed the amount of requests . similarly made by governments for the personal information of its users . during the first half of this year. Like with the Apple report, the U.S . government topped the list, requesting information on 21,000 users, . while India asked for data on 4,144 users in second place, and Britain . came in third with 2,337 requests. However, . not all of these requests were granted; Facebook handed over . information in only 79 per cent of U.S requests, half of India's . requests and 69 per cent of the demands from the UK. The . report shows which countries requested information from Facebook about . its users, the number of requests received from each of those countries, . the number of users/user accounts specified in those requests and the . percentage of these requests in which we were required by law to . disclose at least some data. A study by Big Brother Watch found 70 . per cent of UK adults say British companies should publish reports on . how often they receive requests for customer data from the police and . security services. While 66 per cent of British adults want the government to publish more data about how surveillance powers are used. The research, carried out by ComRes . on behalf of the privacy website, said companies like BT, Sky, .

"A pro-Russian separatist fighting in eastern Ukraine has admitted rebel forces shot down Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, it has been claimed. The militant, who has not been identified, reportedly said fighters blasted the Boeing 777 out of the sky - killing all 298 people on board - after mistaking it for a Ukrainian government cargo plane. He said the rebels only realised their mistake when they began searching the crash site for the parachutes of military crew who may have bailed out the aircraft, only to find the bodies of children. Scroll down for videos . [caption] . The rebel - who worked locally as a miner before joining pro-Russian separatists - told a reporter for Italian newspaper Corriere Della Sera that officers initially told him MH17 was a government plane. 'We shot down a Kiev plane, our superiors told us. We thought we were looking for baled-out Ukrainian pilots but instead we found dead civilians,' he was quoted as saying. 'All those poor people with baggage that certainly wasn’t military... I was looking for a parachute and found the body of a little girl,' he added. His sensational admission that rebel forces shot down MH17 is in stark contrast to other pro-Russian forces in the area, who remain insistent that the plane was taken down by government troops. This morning Alexander Borodai, prime minister of the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic, described evidence suggesting rebels had possession of a BUK missile launcher as 'fake'. A pro-Russian militant holds up a stuffed animal as others look on at the site of the MH17 crash. 298 people were killed when the plane was apparently blasted out the sky by a surface to air missile . Gun wielding: Pro-Russian rebels, followed by international observers, walk by plane wreckage as they arrive for a media briefing at the crash site of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 this week . The 31-year-old fighter, who said he . could not be named in the article but was happy to pose for photographs, . is understood to be from the Oplot combat unit, which was operating in . the area around the Hrabove crash site at the time MH17 was shot down. The newspaper claims they spoke to him at Torez railway station on Tuesday, where he posed for photographs standing alongside one of the refrigerated train carriages containing the bodies of 200 MH17 victims. Ten of his rebel colleagues are said to have stood guard while he spoke. Just hours later these bodies were transported to Khirkiv airport, from where 40 of them were yesterday flown back to Eindhoven in the Netherlands to begin the process of identification - something that is expected to take several months. The wife of a South African helicopter pilot killed in the MH17 disaster has been forced to cancel his credit cards because they have been used since the plane went down in Ukraine last week. Reine Dalziel's husband Cameron, a South African with a British passport who recently moved his family of four to Malaysia, was on board the Malaysia Airlines jet when it was struck by a missile fired by pro-Russian rebels. As it emerged that heartless rebels are using victims' credit cards, answering their phones at the crash site and stealing their belongings - including sentimental items such as jewellery - Ms Dalziel's brother Shane Hattingh told CNN his sister was stunned to see activity on her husband's account. South African helicopter pilot Cameron Dalziel and his wife Reine recently moved to Malaysia with their two children . 'People are abusing it in the Ukraine... They have no respect for each other, look what they're doing,' Mr Hattingh told CNN. 'It's no surprise that they were treating the remains of people like that. It made me angry beyond words.' The claims comes as a series of disturbing new allegations emerged that added further weight to claims pro-Russian rebels looted the MH17 crash scene to sabotage the investigation and cash in on the disaster. Desperate relatives revealed how they had called the mobile phones of their loves ones - only for them to be answered by strangers with 'eastern European-sounding voices'. After the initial shock, they immediately called the phone companies to shut down the accounts to prevent them being used, according to reports. Evidence of looting? The image appears to show a rebel fighter handling a gold ring amid the wreckage . Wreckage: A man looks at the debris scattered at the crash site of the downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, in a field near the village of Hrabove in the rebel-held Donetsk region of Ukraine . Tragic: A child's shoe is seen among the wreckage of MH17. A week after the disaster took place, the crash site is still littered with debris and, in some cases, body parts . Describing . the confusion in the minutes after the crash, the rebel was quoted as saying: 'Our commanders ordered us to get into the lorries . with our weapons and plenty of ammunition. Perhaps 10 minutes earlier, . there had been a huge explosion in the sky.' The men were allegedly told that white objects had been seen falling from the plane as it plummeted to the earth. These were wrongly assumed to have been parachutes and as such the men were told to prepare to fight to round up the military personal they mistakenly believed had been on the flight. 'All of a sudden, I saw scraps of material in a clearing,' he was quoted as saying. 'Underneath I found the body of a little girl, who can’t have been more than five. She was lying face down. It was awful,' the militant added. 'That was when I realised it was a civilian plane. Not a military one. And all these dead people were civilians. A heap of burst suitcases confirmed it,' he went on to say. Care: Coffins containing the remains of MH17 are removed from a transport plane at Eindhoven airport. The dignified reception was in stark contrast to the treatment of the victims' remains in eastern Ukraine . Remembrance: Stewardesses at Schiphol airport observe one-minute of silence in remembrance of the victims of flight MH17 . Yesterday Queen Maxima of the Netherlands broke down in tears alongside members of the Dutch royal family as the first bodies of those killed in the MH17 crash arrived back in Holland during a poignant and emotional ceremony attended by relatives of the victims. The remains of around 40 international victims of the Malaysia Airlines tragedy left Ukraine's Kharkiv airport on two military planes, ahead of a painstaking identification process. The dignified reception at Eindhoven airport is in stark contrast to the treatment of the victims' remains in eastern Ukraine in the days after the crash, where pro-Russian rebels left corpses to decay in the summer heat in body bags dumped around the crash site. Among those attending the solemn ceremony were King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima of the Netherlands, who held on to each other's hands as the bodies were removed from the transporter aircraft. At several points the Dutch Queen was seen wiping tears from her face.

"Police in northern Ohio have charged a woman who was seen on a surveillance video taking a stuffed animal from a child's grave. Ontario police say 54-year-old Frieda Kay Shade turned herself in Wednesday after the cemetery surveillance video was widely viewed on the Internet and TV news. Shade told authorities that she took a stuffed toy duck from the grave of 14-month-old Hayden 'Tank' Cole Sheridan on Saturday because a dog was running loose in the area, and she didn't want it to destroy the toy. Gravesite robber: Frieda Kay Shade was caught on camera stealing a stuffed duck from the grave of 14-month-old 'Tank' Sheridan . Grieving family: Since their son's death, the Sheridan family has noticed items disappearing from his grave . Her attorney said she'll plead not guilty to one count of theft, a first-degree misdemeanor. Shade is accused of taking the stuffed animal hours after the child's family left it for Easter. Hayden Sheridan died in 2007. According to Fox 8, it's not the first time items have disappeared from the boy's grave. After the family buried Hayden Sheridan, they began to notice items, such as toys and solar night lights, that they left on his grave would disappear. Other regular visitors to the graveyard also contacted police about missing items. The parents of Tank Sheridan finally went to the police about the issue in 2012, and a surveillance camera was set up to monitor the grave site. Caught on camera: The surveillance camera has been in place since 2012, but this Easter was the first time it captured a clear enough image of the thief . Grieving family: The repeated thefts made the Sheridan family's grief that much harder to bear . It was only on April 19 that the camera was able to capture a clear picture of the thief. 'I mainly want to know why,' mother Jaclyn Sheridan told WKYC. 'What gave you the right to think it was OK to do it? What made you do it? Why my son?'

"A father got a nasty  shock when he tried to unplug his little girl’s iPad charger – only for it to explode in his hand. Tim Gillooley, 34, was thrown across the room and suffered burns to his fingers when he removed the plug from the wall socket. He said the electric shock would have killed his daughter Chloe, eight. The incident took place at Mr Gillooley’s mother’s house. Shock: Tim Gillooley and his daughter, Chloe, 8, with the Apple iPad and charger, which exploded as he unplugged it giving him a massive electric shock . ‘There was a massive bang and I felt a huge jolt up my arm, and I was thrown completely across the room,’ he said. ‘I was in total shock. Chloe burst into tears and everyone was stunned. ‘This . has very serious safety implications. I am pretty angry because nine . times out of ten, Chloe would have gone to get it herself. ‘I . think it would definitely have killed her. The shock I received was . massive.’ Mr Gillooley, from Warrington, bought Chloe the iPad Mini for . her birthday last November from the Apple Store in Liverpool. Some . months later it began to develop problems while charging, and he . returned to the shop – but was told there was nothing wrong with the . charger or the device. Frazzled: The remains of the iPad charger which Mr Gooley said had exploded in his hand . Instead he purchased a new cable in the hope it would solve the charging problems – but saw no improvement. The . former trader, who is now a full-time carer for his mother, said: ‘We . were big fans of Apple, but I won’t let my daughter near her iPhone now . because it could be a ticking timebomb.’ Apple . is yet to comment on Mr Gillooley’s claims. It has asked him to send it . the iPad and remains of the charger for examination. Mr . Gillooley, who has split custody of Chloe, said he is particularly . upset by the incident because he used the gadgets to keep in contact . with his daughter when she stays with her mother. The . incident follows reports that a  23-year-old Chinese air stewardess, Ma . Ailun, was killed by an electric shock when she answered a call on her . iPhone 5 while it was charging. The tale prompted a wave of criticism of Apple among China’s millions of iPhone users. The victim’s sister said: ‘I want to warn everyone else not to make phone calls when your mobile phone is recharging.’ Miss . Ma, who was due to marry this month, was said to have bought her iPhone . in December from an  official store in her home town in Xinjiang . province. Her brother said . the phone had been handed to the Chinese authorities for examination, . while Apple said it had launched a full investigation into the claims. In . another incident earlier this year, New York marketing manager Shibani . Bhujle claimed the battery of her iPhone 4S spontaneously melted, oozing . acid that destroyed the handset. In January, firemen in Oregon blamed a . fire in a block of flats on an overheated battery for an Apple MacBook . laptop, which had dropped on to a mattress. In . November 2011, Apple recalled its iPod Nano music players amid fears . that the batteries in older  models were prone to overheating and . catching fire.","Tim Gillooley was 'thrown across the room' when he went to unplug device .

"A man, who has fathered nine children by eight different women, has been jailed for headbutting his ex-girlfriend in a row over a cheese toastie. Keith Macdonald, 27, was jailed for 20 days after he was found guilty of assaulting his former girlfriend Stephanie Jubb at their home in East Rainton, County Durham. Miss Jubb was left with a bloody nose and two black eyes in the attack. Keith Macdonald, left, was jailed after for headbutting ex-girlfriend Stephanie Jubb, right, and stealing from her . Macdonald had already been convicted in his absence on June 13 when he had failed to appear at Sunderland Magistrates' Court. Charges of theft and criminal damage were also proved in his absence and on Thursday, he admitted a charge of absconding for not appearing at the earlier court . hearing. . A warrant was issued for his arrest . and he eventually handed himself into police earlier this month. The court heard the couple argued on March 1 when Macdonald, who had been drinking, went to go upstairs to eat a toastie where Miss Jubb had just vacuumed. Former love: Keith with one of his ex-girlfriends, Kelly Bonner . Giving evidence in June, Miss Jubb said: 'He came back and I could smell alcohol on his breath and his eyes were quite bloodshot. 'He was fine he was chatty, he made himself a toastie and went to go upstairs to eat it. 'I told him 'you're not eating that upstairs, I've just hoovered. 'He then threw the toastie and the plate on the kitchen table and shouted 'F**k it!'' She ripped the plug from his X-Box console and Macdonald then threw her Nintendo Wii across the room and assaulted her. He then stole £80 and a Sony Ericsson . mobile phone belonging to Miss Jubb. The 24-year-old then fled to a neighbour's house and said she has been 'angry and upset' since. The pair had previously been in an on-off relationship which ended in 2009, but he contacted her again at the end of 2011 and they reconciled before moving in together in February this year. Show-off: Keith Macdonald shows off Claire Bryant's engagement ring . Jobless Macdonald, from Millfield, Sunderland, fathered his first child at just 15-years-old and met most of his conquests at bus stops.

'He shows in relation to a number of issues a motivation to change. 'Since the incident he has significantly moderated his drinking. 'He said he used to have a drink first . thing in the morning, but since he has been living away from the area . he doesn’t drink at all during the week and has two or three drinks on a . weekend.' Mr Sword said his client had intended . to travel from his then home in Stoke-on-Trent, but lost a train ticket . which he could not afford to replace. Macdonald was sentenced to 20 weeks in prison, minus 14 days already spent on remand. Chairman of the bench Peter Cowling . also made Macdonald the subject of a restraining order for 24 months, . banning him from contacting Ms Jubb or going near her home. Mr Cowling said: 'We feel that only a custodial sentence can be applied.' Baby trail: MacDonald, with Rebecca Wright who gave birth to his child, Clio in 2011 .

"A star footballer is to go on trial accused of torturing and killing his mistress, then feeding her dismembered body parts to his pet dogs. Married Bruno Fernandes de Souza, 27, a goalkeeper once tipped to play for Brazil, is alleged to have turned model Eliza Samudio 'into a human sacrifice' to preserve his reputation after she gave birth to his love child. He is already serving a four-and-a-half-year prison sentence after being convicted of assaulting and abducting Ms Samudio, 25, but will be tried for her murder later this year. On trial: Footballer Bruno Fernandes de Souza, pictured in red shortly after his arrest in 2010, is alleged to have fed model Eliza Samudio's remains to his dogs to avoid paying child support after she had his love child . 'Killed': Brazilian model Eliza Samudio went missing months after she posed for these photographs to show the early signs of her pregnancy. Prosecutors at Bruno's trial will allege that part of her dismembered body was fed to the footballer's pet rottweilers . Prosecutors allege that Bruno planned Ms Samudio's kidnap and murder with eight others, including his wife Dayane, a teenage cousin and former detective Luiz Santos, all of whom have been charged with murder, conspiracy to murder and kidnapping. The goalkeeper, who played for Brazilian club Flamengo, is said to have watched as Santos committed 'barbaric tortures' on Ms Samudio before helping the former detective dismember her body. Parts of the woman's body are alleged to have been fed to Bruno's dogs while the rest was buried in concrete. Bruno is accused of ordering his wife to tell people that his love child, who was four months old at the time of the killing, had been adopted by them from a poor relative. Model: Eliza Samudio is believed to have met Bruno at a party held by another footballer. She later presented a report (right) to police against the footballer, claiming he had made her pregnant . It is also claimed that Bruno told police Ms Samudio was 'a whore who will not be missed by anyone'. A Brazilian newspaper has reported that the prosecution at the trial will allege that Bruno attacked a supporter, smoked cannabis and attended orgies with fellow players. Edson Moreira, a detective who investigated the case, told the Sunday Express: 'An idol like Bruno, from such a major team, has turned out to be a monster. 'We have witnesses who will testify that he turned this girl into a human sacrifice merely to try to protect his reputation.' The trial is expected to hear that Bruno met Ms Samudio at a party held by a teammate. 'Unfortunately for her, they slept together that night and she later discovered she was pregnant,' Mr Moreira said. 'When she approached de Souza and told him he was the father, he became enraged.' Claims: Prosecutors will allege that Bruno organised the abduction and murder of Ms Samudio with eight others . Prosecutors will allege that Bruno planned Ms Samudio's murder after she told him she would take legal action to prove he was the father of her child. In a statement to police, his cousin claimed that, led by Santos, they kidnapped Ms Samudio from a hotel in Rio de Janeiro on June 4, 2010. He said they drove her some 220 miles to a property in Belo Horizonte which the footballer and his wife used occasionally as a weekend retreat, where Ms Samudio was tortured. It is claimed that Santos played loud music on the stereo to drown out the woman's screams. Bruno, whose contract with Flamengo has been suspended, also faces charges of kidnapping, hiding a body and forming a criminal gang with intent to murder. He has maintained his innocence throughout, claiming he has a 'clear conscience'.

"Researchers at the University of Colorado found students think they have been marked more harshly if it is written in red ink . Teachers should stop using red pens to mark homework and tests because it could upset schoolchildren, U.S researchers say. A study showed students think they've been assessed more harshly when their work is covered in red ink compared to more neutral colours like blue. Sociologists Richard Dukes and Heather Albanesi from the University of Colorado told the Journal of Social Science: 'The red grading pen can upset students and weaken teacher-student relations and perhaps learning.' In 2008, hundreds of schools banned . teachers from using red ink to correct work because they considered it . 'confrontational' and 'threatening'. But . Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, slammed . the findings saying: 'In my own experience of 35 years in teaching is . that children actually prefer teachers to use red ink because they can . read comments more easily. 'I . think this research is misguided. The problem with using a colour like . green or blue is that it's not clear. 'A lot of schools seem to have a . culture where they don't like critcising children but actually this . helps them. 'It's not intimidating children want to see where they've made a mistake. I think it's a rather silly idea.' Red associated with 'warning, prohibition, caution, anger, embarrassment and being wrong' according to researchers from the University of Colorado. To test their theory, 199 students were shown one of four different versions of a fictitious student's essay which had been marked, graded and commented on by a lecturer. Some got a high quality essay, given an A grade, complete with positive and negative comments in either red or a 'blue-green' pen. The other volunteers got an essay that clearly was not as good and was given a C grade, again with both positive and negative comments from a teacher writing in either red or blue-green. But for both the high and low quality essays, the volunteers were more likely to think the teacher writing in red was harsher than the one in blue - even though their grades and comments were identical. Red is associated with 'warning, prohibition, caution, anger, embarrassment and being wrong' according to researchers from the University of Colorado . Asked to grade the essay themselves, the students reading those marked in red would raise the good quality essay score by an average of 3.4 per cent. Those reading essays marked in blue would raise the score of the better essay by an average 2.9 per cent. But the gap was bigger among those given the lower grade essay to review. The students reading the one with comments in red would raise the score by 5.6 per cent. But those reading the one with comments in blue-green ink would only raise it by 0.7 per cent, . The volunteers also associated the teachers writing in blue-green as more likely to be 'nice, enthusiastic and have a good rapport with students.' The difference may be small but was described as 'statistically significant' by the researchers. And it tallies with other research suggesting teachers become more aggressive when they write in red ink, while pupils feel more hard done by when they see red on their homework. The researchers reported: 'Results suggest that instructors should use a grading pen of a neutral colour. 'In the context of communication, writing in red seems to shout in the same way as writing in all caps or writing which is underscored. 'That is, writing in the color red is loaded with emotion, and this additional emotional loading of messages on the grading of student assignments may not be a tactic that teachers should use to convey constructive, critical comments to students. 'The main effect of pen colour on the expressive evaluation of teaching is moderate but statistically significant. There appears to be a worthwhile benefit is using an 'aqua' (blue-green) grading pen as opposed to a red one. 'And since this change is an easy one to implement, instructors should consider making this change.'","Students think they are being marked more harshly if it's written in red .

"Roman Abramovich is about to lose his title as the owner of the world's largest private yacht - after this incredible vessel was spotted for the first time. The £400million mega-yacht, known only as Project Azzam, will measure a staggering 590ft (180m) - longer than some cruise ships - when it is completed. This will make the super-secretive yacht around 54ft (17.5m) longer than the Eclipse, which is Chelsea-owning oligarch Abramovich's current flagship vessel. Scroll down for video... Ousted: But Mr Abramovich is about to lose his title as the owner of the world's largest private yacht - after this incredible vessel was spotted in Germany last month . On the move: The yacht, which was minus its bow section, was quickly taken to the larger 220-metre dock so engineers could continue the awesome project . Huge: Eclipse, owned by Chelsea Football Club owner Mr Abramovich, has two swimming pools, two helipads, a gym, hair salon, dancefloor and a 007-style submarine . It is rumoured the boat, which is longer than some cruise ships, has been commissioned by the Saudi Royal Family. Stunned . photographers captured the vessel as it was transported out of the . 170-metre dry dock at German shipbuilder Lurssen's yard because it had . become too large. The . yacht, which was minus its bow section, was quickly moved to the larger . 220-metre dock so engineers could continue the awesome project. Peter . Seyfferth, from TheYachtPhoto.com, said: 'The photographers who took . the pictures of Azzam were overwhelmed by the size of it. Super-secretive: The £400million megayacht, known only as Project Azzam, is rumoured to have been commissioned by the Saudi Royal Family . Rumours: There has been suggestions that the boat, which will be longer than some cruise ships, has been commissioned by the Saudi Royal Family .

The Eclipse has two swimming pools, two helipads, a gym, hair salon, dancefloor and a 007-style submarine. Both yachts are confined to just a handful of areas in the world that can accomdate a boat of such size, including Monaco and Antibes. 'It is difficult to say at this stage but I think it will be a very elegant yacht and more interesting looking then Eclipse. 'There appears to be a special propulsion system which should make it one of the fastest yachts out there. 'In terms of length, we think it will be around 180-metres which makes it longer than some cruise ships. 'If it has been commissioned for the Saudi Royal Family it is unlikely it will leave its dock very often. It is more of a question of prestige, to have the world's largest yacht.' Official details on megayachts such as Project Azzam and Abramovich's Eclipse are notoriously sketchy due to confidentiality agreements set up between the builders and their customers. But they are known to have incredible security systems and it is not uncommon for them to be flanked by smaller yachts and submarines which help make up a billionaire's flotilla. It is thought a yacht this size will . cost its new owner around £400million - and that is just the initial . payment with the yacht having astronomical running costs.

"It looks like something straight out of Middle Earth – and the story behind it is almost as fantastical. This cottage cost just £150 to build, using only natural or reclaimed materials, and is now rented out for a fee of fresh milk and cream. And with no mains electricity, gas or water, the bills don’t come to much either. Scroll down for video . Cob house: Michael Buck built this house at the bottom of his garden for just £150 using natural or unwanted materials he found in skips . Interior: Mr Buck rescued the floorboards from a neighbour's skip and used the windscreen of an old lorry to create several of the home's windows . Inside: Although the cottage has no electricity it does have free running water from a nearby spring and walls painted with a chalk and plant resin mixture . Homely: The cottage has a kitchen and dining area, along with a bunk-style bed to maximise space below . Smallholder Michael Buck spent eight months constructing the house using the ancient technique of  cob – building with a mixture of sand, clay, straw, water and earth. He taught himself the method by reading a book, even shaping the walls without a single power tool. He also made the simple wooden roof frame and thatched it himself with straw from his fields. The 300 sq ft of floor space features floorboards rescued from a skip, while an old windscreen from a lorry provided glass for the windows. With no central heating, you might think it would be a bit chilly, but he says the cob walls and thatched roof make it incredibly well insulated – and the ceiling is stuffed with sheep’s wool from a nearby farm to help keep the heat in further. Resourceful: Mr Buck, pictured outside the cob house, said he wanted to challenge the notion that paying for a house should take a lifetime . Thatched roof: Former art teacher Mr Buck taught himself how to thatch in order to create the cottage's intricate roof . Welcoming: Cob houses are built according to a method thought to date back to prehistoric times which uses only earth, clay and straw . Isolated: The cottage, situated in the Oxfordshire countryside, even has its own thatched outhouse complete with composting toilet . There is also a woodburning stove, strategically placed beneath the mezzanine level double bed to ensure residents stay ‘nice and toasty’ at night, while candles and lanterns provide light. The water supply is free as it comes from a diverted natural spring which gurgles out of a pipe outside, while the ‘natural’ fridge is a shallow well a few yards away from the front door and hidden from view by towering cow parsley. The WC is a composting lavatory in a separate thatched outhouse with a panoramic view of the Oxfordshire countryside, and the ‘bathroom’ is a tin tub hanging on the wall outside which can be brought in and filled as needed. Hard at work: Mr Buck spent two years gathering materials and contructing the house at the bottom of his garden . Site: Mr Buck intended to build the cottage for no cost at all but after 'some things went wrong' he ended up spending £150 on it . Taking shape: Mr Buck said he wanted the house to 'fit in with the landscape rather than intrude upon it' Development: The cottage is built from locally-sourced materials which, apart from the glass, are biodegradable, Mr Buck has said . Natural materials: Mr Buck said that a house 'does not have to cost the Earth - you only need earth to build it'. The property boasts free running water from a nearby spring (right) Retreat: The house features the names of all the people who helped in building it written on the wall, including three cows who provided the dung to help build the walls . Return to where it came from: Mr Buck says while the house could last forever with proper maintenance, it could also one day disappear back into the Earth if it was left . Tradition: English cob was traditionally made by mixing a clay-based subsoil with sand, straw and water before using oxen to trample it . Despite the somewhat Spartan arrangements, Mr Buck is renting out the unusual property. But there isn’t a hobbit in sight – and the current tenant is a worker on a neighbouring dairy farm who pays for her lodgings in milk and cream. Cooking can be done on the woodburner, but she has installed a small gas stove in the kitchenette. Yesterday father of three Mr Buck, 59, who lives in a more conventional home nearby with wife Sheila, 57, said: ‘I wanted to show that houses don’t have to cost anything. We live in a society where we spend our lives paying our mortgages, which many people don’t enjoy.’ Mr Buck originally aimed to build the house for nothing, but miscalculated the amount of straw needed so had to buy more. He also had to buy nails to keep the thatch attached. Friends pitched in to help with the build and their names are written on the wall, along with the names of three cows – Marigold, Crystal and Mist – whose dung was used to make plaster. Mr Buck, a former art teacher, drew the plans for the house on the back of an envelope and did not need planning permission as it was classed as a summer house. Homely: Heat is provided by a wood-burning stove - and thanks to the cob walls and thatched roof the house is surprisingly well-insulated .

"South African prosecutors on Tuesday filed an appeal against the conviction and sentence of star Paralympian Oscar Pistorius, who last month was imprisoned for five years for the culpable homicide of his girlfriend. The National Prosecuting Authority said: 'Today, we announce that the NPA filed the application for leave to appeal both the conviction and sentence. The appeal on conviction is based on the question of law.' The athlete was tried for killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, whom he shot four times through a locked toilet door in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013. Scroll down for video . Oscar Pistorius, pictured, was found guilty of the culpable homicide of Reeva Steenkamp at his home . Reva Steenkamp, pictured, was gunned down in the house she shared with Pistorius on Valentine's Day 2013 . Prosecutors want to overturn the culpable homicide verdict to retry the case for a stiffer jail sentence . Pistorius admitted to shooting Ms Steenkamp, 29, at his upmarket Pretoria home, but told the court he had mistaken her for an intruder. The state sought to prove Pistorius deliberately shot Ms Steenkamp. Pretoria High Court Judge Thokozile Masipa found there was not enough evidence to convict the 27-year-old Paralympic and Olympic athlete of premeditated murder. He was found guilty of culpable homicide, a charge equivalent to manslaughter, after a seven-month trial. Now, prosecutors want to overturn the culpable homicide verdict and instead retry the entire case. If successful, Pistorius could face another marathon murder hearing. The date for the appeal hearing has not been set. NPA spokesman Nathi Mncube said: 'The merits of the NPA's argument in this regard are contained in the papers that were filed with the registrar of the North Gauteng High Court today. 'This means that the matter is now officially sub judice and consequently the NPA will not be able to discuss the matter publicly until judgment is delivered by the court.' Reva Steenkamp's parents June, left, and Barry, right, want Pistorius hit with a far stiffer jail sentence . Prosecutors believe judge Masipa erred in law by returning a culpable homicide verdict and instead should have found the sprinter guilty of premeditated murder. A premeditated murder conviction carries a mandatory life sentence with a minimum jail term of 25 years. Pistorius is currently serving his sentence at a hospital section of a Pretoria prison. The appeal sets the stage for another instalment of a legal battle that has gripped millions around the world. Pistorius was last month jailed for five years for the culpable homicide of Ms Steenkamp, although it is expected that he will only serve a maximum of ten months in custody. Judge Masipa's decision to rule out murder was criticised by legal professionals and the Women's League of the African National Congress as an erroneous interpretation of the law.","Prosecutors lodge court papers seeking to retry Pistorious for murder .

"Islamist militants fighting in Iraq and Syria are producing a weekly English language magazine designed to recruit and radicalise would-be jihadists in the West. The magazine, which is professionally designed and edited, is published by AlHayat Media Center - the propaganda wing of ISIS, the Sunni militant group whose brutal campaign to establish an Islamic state in the Middle East has been branded too extreme even by Al Qaeda. ISIS already make extensive use of social media to keep in near-constant contact with supporters in the West - even selling branded merchandise such as T-shirts, baseball caps and cuddly toys. Scroll down for video . Communications: The professionally designed and edited Islamic State Report is published by the AlHayat Media Center - ISIS' propaganda wing. It is put out once a week, with four editions already released in June . ISIS' weekly magazine is titled 'The Islamic State Report' and is published every seven days. Now on it's fourth edition, the first was printed on June 1. A fifth edition is expected to be released on Saturday. The fourth edition features a slick front page with the headline 'Smashing the borders of the Tawaghit: The Battle of Asadulla Al-Bilawi', and has a photo of masked militants freely crossing the border between Syria and Iraq. All of Iraq's western borders with Syria - which ISIS call Sham - and Jordan are now under the control of the fanatical Islamist militant group, which aims to establish an undemocratic Middle Eastern state. Wide appeal: The magazine uses tabloid-style headlines in its account of ISIS' execution of 1,700 Shi'ite soldiers (pictured). The description of ISIS' takeover of Mosul is written-up in the style of a football match report . Propaganda: The magazine opens with several pages describing the history of Middle East and attempts to justify ISIS' actions as a mission to correct the carving up of the region after the First World War . Many of the ISIS militants active . on social media encourage would-be jihadists in the West to contact them . privately using the smartphone messenger system Kik. Several - including Abu Abdullah Al Britani, who gives regular  jihad advice on social network Ask.Fm - even list their Kik usernames in their Twitter biography. Abu Abdullah has previously told supporters there is no mobile phone signal in the area in which ISIS is fighting. However, he has repeatedly stated that the group are still able to communicate using smartphone messenger services. As such, it would appear ISIS are employing Kik in much the same way as troublemakers used Blackberry's BBM messenger to privately organise themselves during the 2011 UK riots. ISIS has previously developed its own app for Android phones, The Dawn of Glad Tidings, which leveraged Twitter users’ accounts to share tweets related to the group. The app has now been removed. Kik has not yet responded to MailOnline's request for a comment. The magazine opens with several pages . describing the history of Middle East and attempts to justify the . establishing of a caliphate as a mission to correct the carving up of . the region by Allied forces in the aftermath of the First World War. It goes on to boast that in a number of border crossings in western Iraq, ISIS has partially restored the geographical boundaries in place before the famous Sykes-Picot agreement. After dedicating several pages to ISIS' views on 20th Century history, the magazine moves on to a picture-led account of the so-called Battle of Asadullah Al-Bilawi, written with tabloid headlines in the style of a football match report. Sunni followers of ISIS claim the battle, which took place earlier this month and led to the fall of Iraq's second largest city Mosul, led to the execution of 1,700 Shi'ite soldiers. The . publication of the magazine is just the latest in ISIS massive . propaganda campaign, which includes dozens of accounts such as Twitter, .

"A new line of smart toys powered by the supercomputer, IBM Watson, could allow children to have personalised conversations with their toys. The 'CogniToys' are designed to aid a child's development, allowing them to ask questions and receive an age-appropriate reply within a matter of seconds. The company behind the design is now hoping to launch its range of supercomputer-powered dinosaur toys using a crowd funding campaign. Scroll down for video . A new line of smart toys powered by the supercomputer, IBM Watson, could allow children to have personalised conversations with their toys. Pictured is a prototype of one of a 'smart' dinosaur . The dinosaur range has been created by New York-based group, Elemental Path, who is currently attempting to raise $50,000 (£32,500) on Kickstarter to take the toys into production. The toy's chest features a large button that, when pressed, begins the interaction. In a recent focus group in Pennsylvania, children asked the toy questions like, 'How far away is the moon?' and 'Who is Barack Obama?', according to the New York Observer. 'Each toy will get to know the child and grow with him/her, interacting directly with them to create an experience around each child's personal interests,' the company writes on Kickstarter. These 'CogniToys' are designed to aid a child's development, allowing them to ask questions and receive an age-appropriate reply within a matter of seconds. The company behind the design is now hoping to launch its range of smart dinosaur toys that supports full speech recognition and is also able to tell jokes . They don’t need feeding, cleaning or taking for a walk - they are the robotic pets for a generation of children raised on tech and tablets. A new era of sophisticated robotic pets, from lifelike jumping pug dogs to the most talkative of parrots, has been launched by Britain’s toy industry. The techno-pets offer the advantage that they will not make a mess on the carpet or demand they are taken for a walk, making them a more practical option than a puppy or kitten for busy families. Roland Earl, director general of the British Toy and Hobby Association said: ‘There a lot of virtual pets, even the intelligent robots we are seeing might be seen as a pet substitute. ‘They are something to interact with that does not need feeding or cleaning up after. 'Some of the toys are incredibly clever. One of the most popular toys of last year was a parrot that you could talk to and it would then repeat back the words. That was endless fun. Kids really enjoyed that.’ 'The toy will explore favourite colours, favourite toys, interests and use these to customise engagement. 'Even better, the toy has a personality of its own that changes over time.' Elemental Path was put together after they won a developer competition which allowed them access to the IBM Watson technology. The supercomputer originally rose to fame after beating quiz show champion Ken Jennings at Jeopardy . With the IBM Watson-powered system, the toy can respond to questions within a second, the company claims. Within the dinosaur, there is a speaker, microphone, battery pack, and a small piece of hardware that connects to the cloud. The toy is also designed to become smarter the more it is used. For instance, questions that have previously been asked, will be responded to faster the second time. Prototypes of the CogniToys dinosaur are already being created using 3D printing system. The current design is aimed at children aged four to seven, and the system can be customised to include information such as the child's name and age. Early adopters can order the toy on Kickstarter for $99 (£65). The toys are expected to begin shipping on November 1st.

"A student in Taiwan who kept a pair of disposable contact lenses in her eyes for six months has been left blinded after a microscopic bug  devoured her eyeballs. The tiny single-cell amoeba ate away at undergraduate Lian Kao's sight because she didn't take out and clean the contacts once during that time. According to a warning issued by doctors the case was a particularly severe example of a young person under pressure who did not take the time to carry out basic hygiene on their contact lenses. A student in Taiwan kept a pair of disposable contact lenses in her eyes for six months and has been left blinded (file picture) As well as being regularly cleaned, contact lenses should also be removed when swimming and washing. The general advice is to avoid wearing contacts for more than eight hours a day. Yet apparently 23-year-old Kao had even kept her contact lenses in at all times, even at the swimming pool. Medics were horrified when they removed the contact lenses to find that the surface of the girl's eyes had literally been eaten by the amoeba that had been able to breed in the perfect conditions that existed between the contact lens and the eye. An acanthamoeba, which can survive  underneath contact lenses and burrow down through a person's cornea . Warning: If not clean properly, disposable contact lenses can cause red, irritated eyes . Acanthamoeba bugs stick to contact lenses and can then burrow their way through the cornea, causing acute pain. It's only at this stage that a sufferer would be aware they had a problem. Prescription drugs may be able to treat the bug in the early stages, but specialists say it is very difficult to get rid of. In serious cases, the patient needs a corneal transplant but these have a high failure rate, resulting in sight loss. Other steps to prevent the infection include never swimming or using a hot tub or shower when wearing contacts. Each year, infections cause around 6,000 cases of a severe eye condition known as microbial keratitis - inflammation and ulceration of the cornea that can lead to vision loss. Contact lens wearers are at a higher risk, since bacteria can get trapped in the lenses . The director of ophthalmology at Taipei's Wan Fang Hospital, Wu Jian-liang, said: 'Contact lens wearers are a high-risk group that can easily be exposed to eye diseases. 'A shortage of oxygen can destroy the surface of the epithelial tissue, creating tiny wounds into which the bacteria can easily infect, spreading to the rest of the eye and providing a perfect breeding ground. 'The girl should have thrown the contact lenses away after a month but instead she overused them and has now permanently damaged her corneas.' He said that she had been diagnosed with acanthamoeba keratitis, which although rare was always more common in the summer. He confirmed and spoke about the girl's case as a way of urging others to be more careful if they had to use contact lenses. The problem is the condition can build up over several years - it's only when it gets to an advanced stage that contacts wearers become aware of a problem, as that's when it will cause red, irritated eyes, by which time it may be too late.","Single-cell amoeba ate away Taiwanese pupil Lian Kao's sight .

"A mysterious circle on a grainy scan, this is what scientists are claiming is finally evidence that Earth has been visited by aliens. Researchers have claimed the fuzzy outline is a flying saucer that ended up 300ft down on the ocean floor between Sweden and Finland. They were stunned when sonar scans taken while searching for a century-old wreck showed up the shape against the dirt. Scroll down for video . UFO? Sonar scans taken while searching for a century-old shipwreck on the ocean floor between Sweden and Finland showed up this fuzzy outline . The ocean exploration team which found it claims that the earth around the craft has been scarred, suggesting it has tried to move around. Lead researcher Peter Lindberg also suggested that another explanation could be that it was 'a new Stonehenge'. The 'discovery' has sparked a flurry of speculation by UFO watchers and bloggers. Some have even suggested it resembles the Millennium Falcon from the Star Wars series, with its distinctive front forks and round shape. Newspapers in Sweden have put the story on their front pages and asked if this is really the first sign of extra-terrestrial life. The shape was found at the bottom of the Gulf of Bothnia during a search for a sunken wreck which contained several cases of champagne. The shape was found at the bottom of the Gulf of Bothnia during a search for a sunken wreck which contained several cases of champagne . The crew of the Ocean Explorer found the 'UFO' while searching for a shipwreck . Mr Lindberg said it was large and about 60ft in diameter and clearly visible on the sea bed. 'You see a lot of weird stuff in this job, but during my 18 years as a professional I have never seen anything like this. The shape is completely round,' he said. He added that the scars on the earth surrounding it could show where the craft landed and skidded along. Now, however, his team do not have the money or resources to examine the shape further. If it does turn out to be a UFO it will be priceless, but if it is just a shape, it will be worthless. Such claims have been made many times in the past, the most famous of which was the 'Bimini Road', a rock formation in the Caribbean which looked like a road. Located 55miles east of Miami in Florida, the formation has been linked to the lost city of Atlantis although geologists have said it was naturally formed. Experts have also pointed out that even the idea of a flying saucer as a round object might be wrong - the first sighting of such a craft later turned out to be a reporting error. Some enthusiasts have compared the shape to the Millennium Falcon from the Star Wars series, with its distinctive front forks and round shape .",Unidentified object is sitting on the ocean floor between Sweden and Finland .

"British Muslim clerics are willing to carry out sharia marriages involving child brides as young as 12, an investigation has found. Two imams said they would be prepared to officiate at the wedding of an underage girl to a man in his twenties, despite fears the pair would later have sex. The revelations have led the Home Office to confirm that such ceremonies will be examined in the Government’s forthcoming Bill to outlaw forced marriages. Secret marriages: Some Muslim religious leaders consent to marry a girl of 12 if she consents - and her parents keep it a secret (stock image) Child bride: An Imam at the Husaini Islamic Centre in Peterborough agreed to the marriage of a 12-year-old girl - but only if she consented to the nuptials . More than 1,000 of the 8,000 forced . marriages of Britons each year are believed to involve girls of 15 or . under, with one case last year allegedly involving a girl of five. The clerics were approached by man . posing as the father of a 12-year-old  who wanted her to marry to . prevent her being tempted into a decadent Western lifestyle. Imam . Mohammed Kassamali, of the Husaini Islamic Centre in Peterborough, . stressed the need for secrecy with such a ceremony. He allegedly said: ‘If it (the . marriage) was not possible, I would  have told you straight away... I . would love the girl to go to her husband’s houses (sic) as soon as . possible, the younger the better. ‘Under sharia (Islamic law) there is . no problem. It is said she should see her first sign of puberty at the . house of her husband. ‘The problem is that we cannot explain such things (the marriage) if the girl went tomorrow (to the authorities). ‘The other thing is the underage . thing and if tomorrow the girl is,  let’s say coerced or forced into . this, and she goes and reports it to the police then she will put all of . us into the problems.’ Campaigners argue that children can't decide whether they want to be married (posed by model) He also urged the father to encourage the newlyweds to ‘delay the togetherness’, meaning postpone  having sex. Abdul Haque, a retired imam who still . officiates at weddings at Shoreditch mosque, East London, reportedly . agreed to carry out the ceremony after evening prayers on Wednesday. ‘Tell people it is an engagement but it will be a marriage,’ he told an undercover Sunday Times reporter. ‘In Islam, once the girl reaches . puberty the father has the right, the parents have the right, but under . the laws of this country if the girl complains and says her marriage has . been arranged and she wasn’t of marriageable age, then the person who . performed the marriage will be jailed as well as the mother and father.’ He explained how the Prophet Muhammad . had married a seven-year-old girl before adding: ‘We are his followers, . and that is what you have to explain (to your daughter).’ It is not illegal for clerics to perform Islamic marriages, even when one or both of those marrying are under 16. Such marriages are not recognised in British law, so civil formalities can take place only if both are over 16. Islamic law allows a couple to have . sex after marriage but, as the legal age of consent is 16, a husband can . be prosecuted for rape if he has sex with an underage girl.

"Ukip's hopes of a significant breakthrough at the general election have been dealt a blow by polling showing it is not on course to win any of a series of key target seats. Detailed constituency polling commissioned by Lord Ashcroft in Ukip targets found the party behind the Conservatives in all of them. They include Boston and Skegness, where Ukip won its biggest majority in last year's council elections. Scroll down for video . Polling by Tory peer Lord Ashcroft in four Ukip target seats found the party behind the Tories in all of them . Ukip Leader Nigel Farage receives a Whitstable Bay Beer from local landlady Aileen O'Leary during a walkabout in Sandwich, Kent . With pollsters suggesting the Eurosceptic party's vote is likely to be squeezed between now and May, the findings suggest it will struggle to win more than the two seats it already holds. Ukip strategists have privately set a target of winning at least six constituencies in order to hail a major breakthrough. In Boston and Skegness, identified as Ukip's best chance of gaining a seat at May's election, the party is polling 35 per cent, three points the Tories, on 38 per cent. In North East Cambridgeshire, where the Tories have also been alarmed by Ukip's success in local elections, the party is a commanding 21 points ahead. In South Basildon and East Thurrock, despite a 16 per cent swing from the Conservatives to Ukip, the former is six points ahead. Ukip's best hope appears to be in Castle Point, where former Conservative MP Bob Spink defected to Ukip, becoming the party's first MP. Lord Ashcroft's polling put the party just one point behind the Tories. He has previously polled Thanet South, where Nigel Farage is bidding to become an MP, and also found Ukip one point behind. Detailed constituency polling commissioned by Lord Ashcroft in Ukip targets found the party behind the Conservatives in all of them . David Cameron received a boost today after polls showed the Tories ahead in key marginals Boston and Skegness, North East Cambridgeshire, South Basildon and East Thurrock and Thanet South . Ukip insiders predict that Mr Farage will be ousted as party leader if he fails to become an MP but Clacton MP Douglas Carswell, who defected from the Conservatives, hangs onto his seat. Lord Ashcroft said that over the marginal seats as a whole, 22 per cent of 2010 Conservative voters said they intended to vote for Ukip in their constituency in May. However, the vote appears soft – with only 51 per cent of Conservative-Ukip switchers said they ruled out going back to the Tories by election day. More than one fifth - 21 per cent - of 2010 Labour voters also said they would switch to Ukip, as did 23 per cent of 2010 Lib Dems. Most voters in these constituencies were optimistic about the economy over the next year, both for the country as a whole and themselves and their families. However, there were some striking contrasts: 83 per cent of Conservative voters expected Britain's economy to do well overall, compared to 48 per cent of those who said they would vote Ukip. Two thirds of voters in these seats said they either that they were satisfied with David Cameron as Prime Minister - 35 per cent - or that they were dissatisfied but preferred him to Ed Miliband, on 31 per cent. The proportion preferring Mr Cameron included 67 per cent of Ukip voters and nine out of ten Conservative-Ukip switchers. When it came to the election result, 44 per cent of Ukip voters said they wanted to see the Conservatives in government either alone - 31 per cent - or in coalition - 13 per cent - while just over three in ten preferred to see Labour in office, 22 per cent with an overall majority. Despite the Tory lead, Lord Ashcroft cautioned: 'Uip appear to have the edge in these seats in the ground campaign. The battle seems most closely fought in South Basildon and East Thurrock, but the difference is most marked in Castle Point, where people were more than twice as likely to say they had received literature, letters, visits or phone calls from Ukip as from the Conservatives.'","Polls by Tory peer Lord Ashcroft show Ukip trailing in four target seats .

"Americans say they invented them, but the Dutch disagree and have long claimed the squidgy, sugary treats as their own. But it would now appear they are both mistaken, because the humble doughnut was actually invented by the Britsh. Until now the earliest known doughnut recipe dated from 1847 when American Hanson Gregory claimed to have invented them aboard a lime-trading ship when he was only 16. Heritage: The doughnut was invented by the British, not the Americans or Dutch as had been previously thought . But documents have been found showing the wife of a society doctor in Hertford, England, recorded her own recipe for them back in 1800. Baroness Elizabeth Dimsdale’s recipe for 'dow nuts' were taken from a local cook, known only as Mrs Fordham. Her ingredients included sugar, eggs, nutmeg, butter and yeast, which are made into a dough which is rolled out and cut into 'nuts'. The nuts are then deep-fried in 'hogs-lard' before being covered in sugar and left by the fire to rise. Originators: A new doughnut recipe, predating earlier examples, has been discovered in an recipe book written in 1800 by Baroness Dimsdale, the wife of Baron Thomas Dimsdale (right) Baroness Dimsdale perfected her 'dow-nuts' in the kitchen of  her home - Cowbridge House in Hertford, England . Historian Dr Heather Falvey uncovered the 213-year-old recipe book when she was alerted to its potential by a US food historian. Ingredients: . A quarter of a Peck of Flower / A . pound of moist Sugar /  10 Eggs (Yolks & Whites) /  One Nutmeg (grated) / 3/4 of a pound of fresh butter /  A quarter of a pint of Yeast. Technique: . The Baroness, wife of smallpox pioneer Baron Thomas Dimsdale, compiled a collection of 80-plus household hints and 700 recipes. Dr Falvey, historian for the Hertfordshire Record Society, believes even with an eight year margin for error the Baroness can claim to be the original queen of the doughnut. She said: 'The American food historian had come to the conclusion that doughnuts originated in Hertfordshire and the first record he found was in 1810. 'He wondered if anyone in the association knew about it and that struck a bell with me as I remembered doughnuts from the book. 'It’s not clear who the recipe is from, which is frustrating, but she started writing it just after 1800 and the last entry was in 1808.' Dr Falvey added: 'She doesn’t give a lot of instructions on how to do it. 'It’s more what to use. I’ve tried a few of the sweet recipes and they’ve turned out okay.' Researchers previous believed doughnuts originated among 19th Century Dutch settlers in the US. Rival theories suggested they were imported into the US in the 19th Century by Dutch settlers on the East Coast. Dr Falvey has published the first ever doughnut recipe in 'The Receipt Book of Baroness Elizabeth Dimsdale c1800', which was released last week. Other recipes include different soups, fish, pies, meats and desserts. Baron Dimsdale was bestowed with the title of Baron Dimsdale of the Russian Empire by Catherine the Great after he helped a member of her family who smallpox. The family’s records were given to the Hertfordshire Record Society by one of their descendants, Robert Dimsdale, who now lives in Switzerland.

"Jules Verne might have written the classic 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea, but now one British photographer has created his own hilarious version of what a life beneath the waves might entail. Underwater photographer, Jason Isley, 42, originally from Essex, decided to have a bit of fun for a change with some of the smaller colourful reef fish in Borneo and Indonesia.

"Brutal: Human rights lawyer Samira Salih al-Nuaimi (pictured) was publicly executed in the Iraqi city of Mosul after she criticised ISIS on Facebook . ISIS terrorists have publicly executed a human rights lawyer in the Iraqi city of Mosul after she criticised the group on Facebook for destroying religious monuments. Samira Salih al-Nuaimi was seized from her home on September 17 shortly after she allegedly posted messages on Facebook that were critical of the militants' destruction of religious sites in the city. According to the United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq, al-Nuaimi was tried in a Sharia law court for apostasy, before being tortured for five days and eventually being sentenced to public execution. News of al-Nuaimi's shocking death emerged after a coalition of American and Arab forces carried out a third night of deadly airstrikes against ISIS targets which have already killed scores of militants. Al-Nuaimi was killed on Monday, according to a statement released by the UN mission today. Her Facebook page appears to have been deleted since her death. 'By torturing and executing a female human rights' lawyer and activist, defending in particular the civil and human rights of her fellow citizens in Mosul, ISIL continues to attest to its infamous nature, combining hatred, nihilism and savagery, as well as its total disregard of human decency,' Nickolay Mladenov, the UN envoy to Iraq, said in a statement, referring to the group by an alternative name. The militant group captured Iraq's second largest city Mosul during its rapid advance across the country's north and west in June, as Iraqi security forces melted away. The extremists now rule a vast, self-declared caliphate straddling the Syria-Iraq border in which they have imposed a strict interpretation of Sharia law which they claim justifies massacring opponents. In the once-diverse city of Mosul, the group has forced non-Muslims to convert to Islam, pay special religious taxes or face execution -  a policy that has caused tens of thousands to flee. The militants have also enforced a strict dress code on women, going so far as to veil the faces of female mannequins in store fronts. Scroll down for video . Radicals: ISIS supporters slogans as they carry the group's flags in front of the provincial government headquarters in Mosul, Iraq. Samira Salih al-Nuaimi was executed for criticizing ISIS' governance of the city . Strong presence: Military leaders have said about two-thirds of the estimated 31,000 Islamic State militants were in Syria. The U.S. has also been increasing its surveillance flights over Syria, getting better intelligent on potential targets and militant movements . In August, the group destroyed a number of historic landmarks in the town, including several lavish mosques and shrines, claiming the locations promoted idolatry - the practice of worshiping objects or icons  instead of God. It appears to have been this campaign of destruction that led al-Nuaimi to post the critical Facebook messages that ultimately resulted in her death. The Gulf Center for Human Rights yesterday said that al-Nuaimi had worked on issues relating to poverty and the rights of detainees while living and working in Mosul. The Bahrain-based rights group said her death 'is solely motivated by her peaceful and legitimate human rights work, in particular defending the civil and human rights of her fellow citizens in Mosul.' Residents buy bread from a bakery in Tel Abyad on the Syrian-Turkish border yesterday. The area, which is in the heart of the Raqqa countryside, has been the subject of numerous coalition airstrikes . Defiant: A fluttering ISIS flag is flown over a hill in Tel Abyad, on the Syrian-Turkish border yesterday. The area, which is in the heart of the Raqqa countryside, has been the subject of numerous coalition airstrikes . Extreme violence against women who do not conform to the group's primitive ideals is a hallmark of ISIS' approach to governance. In the nearby town of Sderat, militants broke into the house of a female candidate in the last provincial council elections, killed her and abducted her husband, according to the UN. On the same day, another female politician was abducted from her home in eastern Mosul and remains missing. ISIS' brutally oppressive treatment of its four million citizens, as well as the sickening filmed murders of two American journalists and a British aid worker, eventually prompted the US to launch airstrikes against the group in western Iraq last month, and in its Syrian stronghold earlier this week. The U.S. Air Force has worked alongside a coalition of five Arab nations - Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, Qatar and Jordan - in an effort to degrade and eventually destroy the Islamist terror group. Desperate militants are believed to have freed 150 prisoners in the group's de facto capital Raqqa overnight, in the hope it will convince America and its Arab allies to end the airstrikes. The militant stronghold is widely thought to be a base for the group's senior figures - including leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi - and where British hostages Alan Henning and John Cantlie are being held. The prince was joined in the skies by the United Arab Emirate's first female air force pilot, Major Mariam Al Mansouri (pictured), 35, whose F16 fighter was one of several from a group of Arab nations that are blitzing Isis . Force: A handout picture made available by the US Department of Defense today shows a formation of US Navy F-18E Super Hornets refueling having carried out airstrikes on targets linked to ISIS . The news came as a fresh wave of airstrikes from the United States and its Arab allies hit ISIS oil refineries overnight, killing at least 14 militants and striking at the heart of the terror group's funding. ISIS generates up to $2million a day from the sale of oil, employing highly trained engineers to extract thousands of barrels a day from the vast swaths of Syria and Iraq under the terror group's control. Nearly a dozen countries have also provided weapons and training to Kurdish peshmerga fighters, who were strained after months of battling the jihadi group. In other developments Thursday, German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen visited northern Iraq for talks with Kurdish leaders about the fight against Islamic State extremists and Berlin's efforts to help with arms deliveries. Thursday also marked the start of German arms deliveries to the semi-autonomous Kurdish region, with the ultimate goal of supplying 10,000 Kurdish fighters with some 70 million euros ($90 million) worth of equipment.","Samira Salih al-Nuaimi was taken from her home after criticising ISIS online .

"Freak accident: Miles O'Brien, a former science and space correspondent for CNN, lost his left arm after developing a medical condition caused by an injury . When a heavy piece of luggage toppled onto him, hurting his forearm during a recent reporting assignment to Asia, veteran journalist Miles O’Brien was not overly concerned - it was just a nasty bruise, after all. But what the 54-year-old independent science and aerospace reporter did not know is that the injury would ultimately cost him his left arm as a result of a potentially deadly medical condition. In a wry blog post that appeared on his site Tuesday, Mr O'Brien, formerly a reporter for CNN, detailed his ordeal that ended on the operating table nearly two weeks ago. Mr O'Brien, who has two children and lives with his partner in Maryland, explained that on February 12, he had concluded his extended trip to Japan and the Philippines, where he reported on three dimensional printing for a segment on PBS' NewsHour. He was packing up his heavy recording equipment when one of his cases slipped from a bungee cord and fell onto his left forearm. 'Ouch! It hurt, but I wasn't all '911' about it,' Mr O'Brien wrote. 'Maybe a little bit of denial?' His injured limb was painful to the touch and swollen, but O'Brien believed there was still no cause for alarm. The following night, however, the sore arm appeared to be getting worse. The next morning, the veteran correspondent and amateur pilot rushed to a doctor. Scroll down for video . Fateful trip: Earlier this month, O'Brien traveled to Japan and the Philippines to report on 3D printing when the accident occurred . Just a flesh wound: O'Brien, 54, a father of two, wrote on his site that he was loading his TV equipment when one of his cases slipped and fell onto his left forearm, leaving it swollen and sore . 'The look on his face when he saw my forearm got me a little more nervous,' Mr O'Brien recalled. The physician diagnosed him with an acute compartment syndrome: a condition where excessive pressure builds up inside an enclosed space in the body as a result of bleeding or swelling after an injury. According to WebMD, the dangerously high pressure in compartment syndrome impedes the flow of blood to and from the affected tissues. O'Brien was admitted into a hospital, where his injured forearm became discolored and turned numb. The treating physician recommended an emergency fasciotomy: a gruesome procedure that involves long incisions through the skin and the fascia layer underneath to release excessive pressure. ‘It was getting real,’ O’Brien wrote. ‘Of course I wasn’t awake for the action but I was told later that things tanked even further once I was on the table.’ Tough guy: O'Brien, an amateur pilot, initially didn't think his injury was serious, but when his condition worsened, he went to a doctor and was diagnosed with acute compartment syndrome - a condition that involves high pressure buildup inside the body . While under anasthesia, Mr O'Brien lost blood pressure due to complications from compartment syndrome, forcing the surgeon to amputate his arm just below the elbow. 'He later told me it all boiled down to a choice… between a life and a limb,’ O’Brien said. O'Brien awoke in a hospital room to phantom pains from the missing limb and concerns for the future, but said that he was grateful to be alive. ‘Life is all about playing the hand that is dealt you,’ O’Brien quipped in his droll blog entry. ‘Actually, I would love somebody to deal me another hand right about now – in more ways than one.’ Tough choice: The well-regarded aerospace reporter emerged from surgery with his left arm amputated below the elbow after his doctor made the call to sever the body part in order to save his life . A Graduate of Georgetown University, O'Brien had spent 17 years of his 30-year career in the news business as a science and space correspondent for CNN. In 2008, O’Brien left the news network and struck out on his own, producing segments for PBS, Discovery Science and National Science Foundation.","Miles O'Brien, 54, suffered from acute compartment syndrome: a condition where pressure builds up in enclosed space inside the body .

"Russian academics are calling for a scientific probe into claims of a 'Siberian Loch Ness monster' in one of the world's remotest lakes. Researchers using underwater scanners have found evidence of 'Nesski' - measuring up to 33 feet in length - in the deep waters of Lake Labynkyr, says a new report. Intriguingly, the evidence is at a lake where native Evenk and Yakut people have long claimed an underwater creature lurks. Proof: This photograph, said to be the head of the underwater beast, is being used as evidence to prove the existence of a Siberian Loch Ness monster . The evidence includes a picture which, it is claimed, shows the monster, says the Siberian Times. Known as ‘the Devil', testimony dating back to the 19th century says the monster has enormous jaws. Associate Professor Lyudmila Emeliyanova, of Moscow State University, told The Siberian Times that on her own scientific mission to Labynkyr she recorded ‘several seriously big underwater objects’ with sonar readings. Images have also recently emerged from a 2006 scientific trip to the lake when strange objects - one of 21ft 4in (6.5 metres) in length - were recorded on a Humminbird Piranha MAX 215 Portable fish-finder at a depth of 138 to 197 feet. Territory: Lake Labynkyr in Siberia, the alleged home of a giant 'Nesski' monster . Based on the sonic readings, researchers drew how the creature might look in real-life on the fish-finder's screen. ‘It was our fourth or fifth day at the lake when our echo sounding device registered a huge object in the water under our boat,"" said Dr Emeliyanova of her own close encounter. It was clearly alive and too large to be one of the dozen or so known fish species in the lake. ‘The object was very dense, of homogeneous structure, surely not a fish nor a shoal of fish, and it was above the bottom,"" she said. ‘I was very surprised but not scared nor shocked, after all we did not see this animal, we only registered a strange object in the water. But I can clearly say - at the moment, as a scientist, I cannot offer you any explanation of what this object might be.’ Lady in red: The echo device shows a mysterious shape and the scientists made a drawing, right in red, of what Nessie's Russian cousin might look like . Nesski caught: The device, normally used to find and trace fish movements discovered a strange dense object in the lake . Artists impression: The scientists have made a drawing of a not-so-happy monster on the screen . Other similar findings since her 2002 mission mean that a new scientific mission to discover the truth is essential, said Dr Emeliyanova, a biogeographer. ‘I believe there is a mystery in this lake because there is no smoke without fire,’ she said. She was told an account of two fishermen who were ‘in a 10 metre long boat when suddenly the bow began to rise as if somebody was pushing it from under the water. 'It was a heavy boat, only a huge and strong animal can do such a thing. The fishermen were stuck by fear. They did not see anything, no head, no jaws.’ Another 'sighting' came when a group of Russian geologists were fishing in the lake. ‘Suddenly those in the boat started screaming - apparently they saw a huge head of some creature. Others, who were waiting for them on shore, started shooting, and scared the creature away,’ said a witness. Monster or myth?: The local population have given testimonies on the monster they call 'the Devil' since the 19th century . A 1953 sighting of a 'monster' in neighbouring Lake Vorota by respected Soviet geologist Viktor Tverdokhlebov was initially covered up by the Soviet authorities. But now Dr Emeliyanova wants to investigate a theory that the two lakes are linked by underground tunnels. Strangely, despite being close to Oymyakon, the coldest inhabited town on Earth, the lake does not freeze completely in winter. There has been speculation in Russia  that Labynkyr and Vorota might be inhabited by a school of ichthyosaurs, prehistoric marine reptiles resembling dolphins or sharks, or  plesiosaurs, a popular theory concerning 'Nessie' in Scotland which is often depicted with a long neck. Another version is that relic killer whales could have become marooned in Labynkyr when it was attached to the sea. Some accounts even suggest the 'creature' makes a hideous primeval cry as it attacks its prey. ‘Personally, I do believe that when the information about something strange circulates among local people for so many years, it just can't be groundless, it means something is there,’ said Dr Emeliyanova. ’I know the local people very well - they are ingenuous but they do not lie.’ She stressed: ‘There are many lakes in Yakutia and around the Indigirka River, hundreds of them, big and small, their shores are more or less populated, but all the talk is about Labynkyr and Vorota lakes, and it has gone on for many dozens of years. 'It makes us think about it. And these stories about the local monster are older than those about the Loch Ness monster.’","Giant underwater monster rumoured to be living in remote Siberian lake .

"From a lunar base to alien spaceships, the dark secrets hidden in the moon's surface have long been a source of fascination for conspiracy theorists. Now one YouTube user believes he has made the ultimate find on images from Google Moon - an alien figure lurking in the satellite’s deep craters. Wowforreel's video shows what he says could be an alien figure walking along the surface and it has already been viewed more than two million times in less than a month. However, the most likely explanation for the sighting is a psychological phenomenon called Pareidolia, which is the brain's response to seeing faces and other significant objects in random stimulus. Scroll down for videos . What is this mystery figure on the moon? The image was spotted on the Google Moon site by web user Jasenko. Nasa announced the shape is simply 'dust, an eyelash [or] scratch on the negative' of the film that took the image . Seeing familiar things in random objects is nothing new.

The strange shape can also be seen on Google Moon at 27°34’26.35″N 19°36’4.75″W. Tom Rose, a paranormal explainer, wrote in the Examiner the figure bears an uncanny resemblance to what the ancient statue, 'The Colossus of Rhodes', is thought to have looked like before it was felled a massive earthquake in 226 BC. Wowforreel said he started investigating the shadow after receiving an online tip from another web user named Jasenko. ‘An irregularly shaped dark spot he noticed on Google Moon looks like it could be a cast shadow from a massive standing object, or figure,’ Wowforreeel told UFO Sighting Daily. ‘At first I thought maybe it was something drawn into the picture but after going to Google Moon, whatever it is or isn't…uh, is there.’ The images used to create the lunar images for Google's moon series come from Nasa. However, the space agency has yet to comment on exactly what they believe the image shows. 'An irregularly shaped dark spot he noticed on Google Moon looks like it could be a cast shadow from a massive standing object, or figure,' Wowforreeel told UFO Sighting Daily . This isn’t the first time that Wowforreel has spotted strange objects after ploughing through Google’s moon series. In January, the user highlighted controversial images which showed what some people believed could be a secret alien base or spaceship on the moon. The triangular anomaly, spotted on Google's map of the moon, had rows of seven light-like dots along its edge. Tom Rose, a paranormal explainer, wrote in the Examiner that the figure bears an uncanny resemblance to what the ancient statue, 'The Colossus of Rhodes', is thought to have looked like before it was felled a massive earthquake in 226 BC . 'Is it just a weird looking crater? or is it something else?,' he asked. 'It is really there, not faked and I have no clue what it is. I found nothing else like it in any of the other craters.' According to website Tech and Gadget News: . 'The gigantic shape actually looks like the leading edge of an immense, . triangular space ship, similar to, so far, super secret stealth . aircraft technology, but is much larger than any airplane ever built on . Earth. 'The regularly spaced, circular . promontory shapes which make up the seven points on the perfectly formed . triangle wedge seem to be intelligently designed. This triangular anomaly with rows of seven light-like dots along its edge has been tracked down on the Google Moon viewer . The two-sided, triangular feature on the lunar surface, was uncovered paranormal researcher WowForReeel. It can be found on the Google Moon viewer at coordinates 22042'38.46N and 142034'44.52E . Google Moon works in a similar way to Google Earth. It was launched in 2009 on the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 lunar landing. The landing site of each of the Apollo . missions is shown on the satellite image, providing more information on . each mission as the user zooms in. The first version of Google Moon only included low-resolution satellite imagery of the entire moon, and when zoomed in too close, a Swiss cheese pattern would appear. 'To date, no other feature has ever been discovered which matches this shape on the moon, or any other planet observed by satellite or exploratory rover. 'The anomaly is so huge, it's possible it is some sort of moon base used as a facility for storing and launching alien UFO spacecraft.' The same YouTube user also claims to have found a similar mystery structure on Earth, nestled under the ice in Antarctica. 'It is also a triangular shape, measuring 125 by 90mtres. 'It is unique in the area,' he said. Tricks of light in space photography have led to a number of excited reports about alien life in our solar system. In November, paranormal researchers found what they believed to be evidence of a  fossilised iguana on the surface of Mars. The mysterious object was spotted by UFO Sightings Daily who uncovered the photograph in Nasa’s archives. Earlier this week a 'human face' was pointed out by the German Aerospace Centre's youth portal, DLR_next, on the Rosetta's comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko . ‘This is not the first animal found on Mars, actually there have been about 10-15 to date,’ Mr Warring told news site agoracosmopolitan.com. ‘I even found a rock that moved four times in four photos...then vanished on the fifth.’ More recently, a 'human face' was pointed out by The German Aerospace Centre's youth portal, DLR_next, on the Rosetta's comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.

"International condemnation: Turkey's prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been strongly criticised after branding Zionism 'a crime against humanity' Turkey's prime . minister, has been strongly criticised after branding . Zionism 'a crime against humanity.' Recep Tayyip Erdogan told a United Nationals forum this week: 'As with Zionism, anti-Semitism and fascism, it is inevitable that Islamophobia be considered a crime against humanity.' New U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is expected to take Turkey's prime minister to task for the 'objectionable' comments during his visit to the country. Kerry, on his first trip to a Muslim nation since taking office, is meeting Turkish leaders for talks meant to focus on Syria's civil war and bilateral interests from energy security to counter-terrorism. But comment by Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan at a U.N. meeting in Vienna this week, condemned by his Israeli counterpart, the White House and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, has clouded his trip. 'This was particularly offensive, frankly, to call Zionism a crime against humanity ... It does have a corrosive effect (on relations),' a senior U.S. official told reporters as Kerry flew to Ankara. 'I am sure the secretary will be very clear about how dismayed we were to hear it,' the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said . Criticism: U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry arrives in Ankara, Turkey - he is expected to take Turkey's prime minister to task for the 'objectionable' comments during his visit . 'To state the obvious, it complicates our ability to do all of the things that we want to do together when we have such a profound disagreement about such an important thing.' Washington needs all the allies it can get as it navigates the political currents of the Middle East, and sees Turkey as the key player in supporting Syria's opposition and planning for the era after President Bashar al-Assad. But the collapse of Ankara's ties with Israel have undermined U.S. hopes that Turkey could play a role as a broker in the broader region. 'The Turkey-Israel relationship is frozen,' the U.S. official said. 'We want to see a normalization ... not just for the sake of the two countries but for the sake of the region and, frankly, for the symbolism,' he said. 'Not that long ago (you) had these two countries demonstrating that a majority Muslim country could have very positive and strong relations with the Jewish state and that was a sign for the region (of what was) possible.' Unwelcome: The comments were condemned by his Israeli counterpart, Benjamin Netanyahu, left, the White House and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, right . Erdogan's caustic rhetoric on Israel has won applause from conservative supporters at home but raised increasing concern among Western allies. 'Erdogan's comments about Israel have become progressively more worrying,' said Moshe Kantor, President of the European Jewish Congress. 'This type of rhetoric is pushing Turkey further away from the West and Europe and closer to Iran.' Ties between Israel and mostly Muslim Turkey have been frosty since 2010, when Israeli marines killed nine Turks in fighting aboard a Palestinian aid ship that tried to breach Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip. In recent weeks, there has been a run of reports in the Turkish and Israeli media about efforts to repair relations, including a senior diplomatic meeting last month in Rome and military equipment transfers. Refusal: Washington has given $385 million in humanitarian aid for Syria but U.S. President Barack Obama has so far refused to give arms . The reports have not been confirmed by either government. Turkey's relations with the United States have always been prickly, driven more by a mutual need for intelligence than any deep cultural affinity. And Erdogan's populist rhetoric, sometimes at apparent odds with U.S. interests, is aimed partly at a domestic audience wary of Washington's influence. But the two have strong common interests. Officials said Syria would top the agenda in Kerry's meetings with Erdogan and President Abdullah Gul, building on the discussions in Rome between 11 mostly European and Arab nations within the 'Friends of Syria' group. After the Rome meeting, Kerry said on Thursday the United States would for the first time give non-lethal aid to the rebels and more than double support to the civilian opposition, although Western powers stopped short of pledging arms. 'We need to continue the discussion . which took place in Rome ... in terms of the main goals there is no . daylight between us and the Americans,' a senior Turkish official said. 'A . broad agreement was reached on supporting the opposition. Now our sides . need to sit down and really flesh out what we can do to support them in . order to change the balance on the ground,' he said. Turkey has been one of Assad's fiercest critics, hosting a NATO Patriot missile defence system, including two U.S. batteries, to protect against a spillover of violence and leading calls for international intervention. It has spent more than $600 million sheltering refugees from the conflict that began almost two years ago, housing some 180,000 in camps near the border and tens of thousands more who are staying with relatives or in private accommodation. Washington has given $385 million in humanitarian aid for Syria but U.S. President Barack Obama has so far refused to give arms, arguing it is difficult to prevent them from falling into the hands of militants who could use them on Western targets. Turkey, too, has been reluctant to provide weapons, fearing direct intervention could cause the conflict to spill across its borders.","Comments made by .

"Parents of toddlers are wasting more than £500 a year on specialist children’s milk, despite ordinary cow’s milk being healthier and cheaper, say consumer watchdogs. The milk is marketed as providing all the nutrients needed by children aged one to three, with some brands adding iron and omega 3 and 6 fatty acids to promote growth. However, consumer group Which? has found that some brands have less calcium and more sugar than cow’s milk. Which? found some brands of specialist toddler formula have more sugar and less calcium than cow's milk . The study found mums waste up to £500 a year buying formula when cow's milk is cheaper and healthier . It added that although toddler milks do contain more iron and vitamin D than ordinary milk, such nutrients can be obtained from a normal diet and a multivitamin supplement. A spokesman said: ‘A daily recommended serving of most toddler milks doesn’t meet the calcium requirements of a one- to three-year-old, unlike a 300ml serving of cow’s milk.’ Conventional milk has 122mg of calcium – important for growing bones and teeth – per 100ml, while products from Aptamil and Cow & Gate have just 86mg per 100ml. The Hipp Organic Combiotic Growing Up milk powder has 7.9g of sugar per 100ml, while full fat cow’s milk has just 4.7g. Government advice says children can safely drink cow's milk from the age of one . The Government recommends giving children aged six months to five years a multivitamin containing vitamins A, C and D. It also advises that toddler milk is unnecessary because children can safely drink cow’s milk from the age of one. However, 46 per cent of parents buy powdered or ready-made milks from manufacturers such as SMA, Aptamil, Cow & Gate and Hipp. In calculating the cost, Which? used SMA’s recommended daily consumption of 500ml of its ready-to-drink toddler milk, which worked out at £1.63 a day or £593.53 a year. The Government advises that children should drink 300ml a day of full fat cow’s milk, at 17p a day or £62 a year. Richard Lloyd, executive director of Which?, said: ‘When so many household budgets are severely squeezed, parents could be saving hundreds of pounds on toddler milks that the Government says are unnecessary. ‘Ministers should make their advice much clearer and introduce guidance on the ingredients of toddler milks, including the level of sugar and calcium.’ However, Roger Clarke, director of the British Specialist Nutrition Service, which speaks for manufacturers, said: ‘Toddler milks contain around half the amount of protein in cow’s milk, 60 per cent less sodium and less saturated fat than cow’s milk.’ A spokesman for Hipp Organic said: ‘The only form of sugar in Hipp Organic Combiotic Growing Up milk is lactose, naturally occurring milk sugar. No other sugars are added.’","Watchdog said some brands have less calcium and more sugar than cow's .

"Kangaroos may be nature's most elegant hoppers, but their walk is anything but graceful. When foraging for food, these usually majestic creatures look ungainly and awkward as they attempt to balance their heavy bodies. But now researchers have discovered that appearances may be deceiving, and there cumbersome movements are in fact helped by a fifth ‘limb’; their tails. Scroll down for video . Scientists from Colorado, Sydney and Burnaby in Canada discovered that a red kangaroo’s tail provide as much driving force as their front and hind legs combined. Pictured is the tail skeletal structures with corresponding photo of a red kangaroo . Scientists from Colorado, Sydney and Burnaby in Canada discovered that a kangaroo’s tail provide as much driving force as their front and hind legs combined. 'We found that when a kangaroo is walking, it uses its tail just like a leg,' said Associate Professor Maxwell Donelan of Simon Fraser University in in Burnaby, Canada. ‘They use it to support, propel and power their motion. In fact, they perform as much mechanical work with their tails as we do with one of our legs.' The researchers began the study thinking the tail was mainly used like a strut, a balancing pole, or a one-legged milking stool. Red kangaroos are the largest of the kangaroo species in Australia. When grazing on grass, they move both hind feet forward 'paired limb' style while using their tails and front limbs together to support their bodies . 'What we didn't expect to find was how much power the tails of the kangaroos were producing. It was pretty darn surprising,’ said Associate Professor Rodger Kram at the University of Colorado Boulder. Red kangaroos are the largest of the kangaroo species in Australia. Red kangaroos are the largest of the kangaroo species in Australia. Their legs work much like a rubber band. The males can leap over 30 ft (9 metres) in one leap. This species is a very large kangaroo with long, pointed ears and a squared-off muzzle. The creatures primarily eat green vegetation, particularly fresh grass, which makes up 75 per cent to 95 per cent of their diet. When grazing on grass, they move both hind feet forward 'paired limb' style while using their tails and front limbs together to support their bodies. A red kangaroo can increase its metabolism by 50 times during exercise. A kangaroo’s tail provide as much driving force as their front and hind legs combined. The kangaroo tail also boosts balance when male kangaroos grab each other by the chests or shoulders to assert dominance. When grazing on grass, they move both hind feet forward 'paired limb' style while using their tails and front limbs together to support their bodies. 'They appear to be awkward and ungainly walkers when one watches them moseying around in their mobs looking for something to eat,' said Professor Kram. 'But it turns out it is not really that awkward, just weird.' In human movement, the back foot acts as the gas pedal and the front foot acts as a brake, which is not especially efficient, said Professor Kram. Professor Donelan said no animal other than the kangaroo uses its tail like a leg. ‘Their tails have more than 20 vertebrae, taking on the role of our foot, calf, and thigh bones.' The research project had its beginnings in 1973 when a Harvard Professor Richard Taylor coaxed a small group of kangaroos to hop and walk on a large motorised treadmill, with a goal of measuring the energy costs of locomotion at varying speeds. This study showed that a kangaroo can increase its metabolism by 50 times during exercise. The kangaroo tail also boosts balance when male kangaroos grab each other by the chests or shoulders, then rear back and kick each other in the stomach in an attempt to assert dominance for the purpose of reproduction. Professor Donelan said no animal other than the kangaroo uses its tail like a leg. ‘Their tails have more than 20 vertebrae, taking on the role of our foot, calf, and thigh bones,' he said . For the study the team videotaped five red kangaroos in Dawson's Sydney lab that had been trained to walk forward on a force-measuring platform with Plexiglas sides. The platform's sensors measured vertical, backward and forward forces from the legs and tails of the animals. The kangaroos had been taught that walking forward on the platform resulted in being rewarded with sweet treats. ‘This was a study we just could not let go of,' said Professor Kram. 'It was just too much fun. It's a real wonder of nature, how these kangaroos move about and what they are able to do.' He likens the evolution of the kangaroo tail to a roll of duct tape in the back of a truck. 'You know you are going to use it, you just don't know when,' he said. 'I'm envious of kangaroos,' said Professor Kram, a competitive master runner in the mile and 1,500 metres. 'When they hop faster, they don't use energy at a faster rate. The have the ability to move faster and not get tired, the ultimate goal of a runner.’ A kangaroo can increase its metabolism by 50 times during exercise.

"The woman beheaded by a Muslim convert was a grandmother who had lost her home in a tornado, it emerged today. Alton Alexander Nolen, 30, is accused of killing Colleen Hufford, 54, and stabbing Traci Johnson, 43, who apparently were attacked randomly at the Vaughan Foods facility in Moore on Thursday, after he was fired from his job . Hufford, who had been married for 25 years, had lost her family home in the Moore tornado. Alton Alexander Nolen, 30 (left), is accused of attacking and killing his co-worker Colleen Hufford and injuring another Traci Johnson, (right), on Thursday at Vaughan Foods in Moore, Oklahoma, after he was fired from his job . Hufford, 54, who had been married for 25 years, had lost her family home in the Moore tornado . Her neighbours described her as 'quick to smile' and said her husband picked her up from the food processing plant every night and he was outside when he found out she had been killed. Today it was revealed that Nolen had served less than two years of a six-year prison sentence for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, reports News OK. According to records he went to prison March 10, 2011, to start a two-year sentence for marijuana possession and another two-year sentence for assaulting a highway patrol trooper, the website reported. He began his six-year sentence for cocaine possession April 26, 2011, records show - due to plea agreements with prosecutors, he was allowed to serve the three prison sentences at the same time. Salute: Alton Alexander Nolen, 30, attacked Colleen Hufford and Traci Johnson after he was sacked from Vaughan Foods in Oklahoma, police said. Above, Nolen (center) apparently performs ISIS's one-finger salute . 'Killer': The suspect  reportedly beheaded Colleen Hufford, 54, and stabbed Traci Johnson, 43, before he was shot and wounded by off-duty sheriff's deputy and firm CEO Mark Vaughan. Above, Nolen reads the Koran . Because of credits, he was able to complete all three prison sentences in just two years and he was released on March 22, 2013, records show. 'Our intent was to incarcerate him much longer than a year and 11 months,' Oklahoma County District Attorney David Prater said Friday. 'This case perfectly illustrates the problem with the Department of Corrections. 'If it's not an 85 percent crime, we have no idea how long a person will actually spend in prison,' Prater said. Nolen was shot by sheriff's deputy Mark Vaughan, who is also the firm's CEO. In prayer: It has emerged that Nolen (seen praying) apparently celebrated terrorism, promoted Islam and disparaged non-Muslims in a series of posts on Facebook in the months leading up to the alleged killing . At work: Meanwhile, in another, he uploaded a photo of the Joker with a message criticising the 'wicked' U.S. for not helping the people of Gaza against Israel. Above, Nolen is pictured loading food onto a shelf at work . In custody: Over a one-year period, Nolen also apparently posted images of Osama bin Laden, deadly weaponry, a poster reading 'Islam will dominate the world' and children learning how to shoot guns . Islamic convert: Other posts saw Nolen reading the Koran, donning Muslim religious clothing (pictured), praying in a mosque and seemingly performing the one-figure salute of the Islamic State terror group . He has now regained consciousness and was interviewed by detectives Saturday. Police Sgt. Jeremy Lewis said that Nolen will be charged Monday with first-degree murder and assault and battery with a deadly weapon and that he may also face federal charges. Meanwhile, a spokesman for an Oklahoma City Islamic group said Saturday that Nolen was a frequent worshipper at a mosque the group maintains and that he remembers the suspect as 'a little weird.' 'He was a nice, quiet, low-key guy,' said Saad Mohammed, director of information for the Islamic Society of Greater Oklahoma City. Scene: On Friday, 911 calls revealed the panic of employees, with a caller telling the dispatcher: 'They're in the office, front office of the building. Yeah, we can hear a lot of screaming. Above, the scene at Vaughan Foods . Heroic: Mark Vaughan, pictured above, shot the suspect multiple times to put an end to his killing spree. Mr Vaughan is the former president of the company, left, and a reserve sheriff's deputy, rig . 'He acted a little odd,' Mohammed said, though he added that Nolen's behavior never raised any 'red flags.' Mohammed said Nolen began worshipping at one of the group's mosques in May. He says Nolen wasn't outgoing and that his behavior didn't raise any red flags. He also said that Nolen attended services where sermons were delivered against beheadings like those committed by Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, militants, reports CBS News. Lewis said Nolen was fired right before the attack, and that he then drove from the building that houses the company's human resources department to its main distribution center. Once inside, he attacked 54-year-old Colleen Hufford with a knife in the center's administrative office area, eventually severing her head, according to police. Nolen then repeatedly stabbed 43-year-old Traci Johnson before Mark Vaughan, a reserve sheriff's deputy and the company's chief operating officer, shot him, police said. Johnson was treated for her injuries at the University of Oklahoma Medical Center, where she was released Saturday, said Varina Shellman, clinical coordinator for the medical center. Emotional: Employees and friends wait behind a tape for word of loved ones as police investigate on Thursday . Sadness: Workers stand in silence outside Vaughan Foods as they wait to leave following the grisly attack . Overwhelmed: A worker from Vaughan Foods reacts after her colleague was beheaded during the attack . Lewis said Johnson was also interviewed Saturday. Police learned Nolen was fired for 'numerous reasons' involving 'personnel issues,' Lewis said, adding that he didn't know the specifics. Police asked the FBI to help investigate Nolen after co-workers told investigators he had recently started trying to convert several employees to Islam. Lewis said police asked the FBI to look into Nolen's background because of the nature of the attack, which followed a series of high-profile videotaped beheadings by Islamic State militants. Mohammed said Nolen had attended services where sermons were delivered condemning such attacks. 'In no way, shape or form did he represent Islam in this foolish act,' Mohammed said. In a statement, FBI Special Agent in Charge James E. Finch said the motive for the attack had not been determined, but that there is no reason to believe there was a threat to anyone else. 'We don't have any reason to believe there is any danger to the area,' Lewis said. According to Oklahoma Department of Corrections records, Nolen served time in prison and is on probation for assault and battery of a police officer. He also was convicted of cocaine possession with the intent to distribute in 2011. The records show that Nolen has what appear to be religious tattoos, including one referencing Jesus and one in Arabic that means 'peace be with you.'","Alton Nolen, 30, allegedly killed Colleen Hufford, 54, in Moore, Oklahoma .

Stunning: Photographer Ted Grambeau captured beautiful photographs of 36-year-old Hannah Fraser swimming with whales in the wild to promote their conservation . Inspired: Hannah, an Australian who now lives in LA, made her first mermaid tail at the age of nine, after seeing the film Splash with Daryl Hannah . Hannah can hold her breath for up to two minutes and swim to depths of 45 feet, allowing her to move like a real mermaid, without the restraints of diving gear. In these images she is seen swimming with humpback whales off Vava'u Island, Tonga, to promote marine conservation and oppose whale hunting. Hannah and her then husband Dave Rastovich, a surfer, were upset and frustrated after International Whaling Commission meetings where whaling nations were allowed to continue their slaughter under the guise of 'scientific research'. 'It was depressing and we wanted to go somewhere to connect with the whales and to raise awareness,' said Hannah. Fish out of water: Deep sea swimmer Hannah Fraser has been fascinated with mermaids since she was three years old and can swim to great depths using her homemade tail. Now Hannah works as a model, actress and performer, swimming with whales, dolphins, stingrays and sharks . Feisty fish: Hannah has been confronted by sharks while underwater, but says she scared them off with a frightening face . The couple flew to Tonga with photographer Ted Grambeau, who was able to capture beautiful images of humpbacks swimming with Hannah, in scenes documented by filmmaker Bali Strickland. 'A baby humpback was curious and actually came up to me,' said Hannah. 'The whales were singing so loudly and the baby whale was squealing, which sounds even louder under the water. It was a very powerful experience.' Many photographs for anti-whaling campaigns show brutal acts including harpooning and whales being winched onto ships, which can be too horrific for ordinary observers. But Ted's images appear in the children's book, The Surfer and the Mermaid, and aim to inspire whale conservation. He added: 'All the shots of Hannah are really poetic - really just surreal, beautiful shots.' In 2007, Hannah swam in the sea in Taiji, Japan, with 30 surfers, celebrities and musicians, in an attempt to halt the ruthless slaughter of thousands of dolphins by local fishermen. Hannah remembers: 'Half of the dolphins had been caught and the others were roped off in the middle of the bay to be herded towards the fishermen. Impressive: Underwater images show Hannah swimming with dolphins and whales, which she says gravitate towards her . Deep blue: Hannah is seen here swimming with humpback whales off Vava'u Island, Tonga, to raise awareness of marine life and oppose whale hunting . Spreading her message: Filmmaker Rob Benavides is currently shooting a documentary about Hannah, which will feature her work as a mermaid and sea-life campaigner . 'Instead of being frightened, the dolphins were trying to come closer to us in their net, as if they knew we wanted to help them. 'But at this point the fishermen were hitting us with sticks and moving their boat propellers towards us. We couldn't get any closer and we couldn't save the dolphins. 'It was indescribable to see this happening and have to abandon them. I cried for hours afterwards. It was hard to be part of the human race at the point.' Two years later, in 2009, Hannah swam in her tail with 14ft Great White Sharks off Guadalupe island, Mexico. 'I thought if I was going to be a professional mermaid I'd have to face my fear of sharks,' she admitted. After trying out the shark-infested waters in scuba gear, Hannah was about to put on her mermaid tail, when one of the sharks became trapped in the diver's cage. 'Luckily the shark freed itself in time. But it made me realise it was safer not to use the cage,' she said. 'I got my tail on and got into the water. I was supposed to be surrounded by divers, but in the mermaid tail I swim much faster than anyone else. I realised I was on my own, but I stayed calm.' She added: 'Another time a shark turned round and came towards me, so I made a scary face and screamed at it in the water. Amazingly I scared it off. I felt invincible for months afterwards.' Filmmaker Rob Benavides is currently shooting a documentary about Hannah's life, which will feature her work as a model, diver, and sea-life campaigner. 'One of the imperative messages in marine conservation right now is overfishing,' she said. 'We should be asking countries to better regulate their fishing industries. 'We shouldn't be eating any fish, but if any it should be only little ones. Large fish take years to grow and reach maturity. If we continue taking them from the ocean it will be a long time before stocks are replenished.' Hannah Fraser is featured in a new children's book Last Night I Swam With A Mermaid by Kimberley Muller.

"A former polygamist kicked out of the Fundamentalist Mormon church by 'prophet' Warren Jeffs is fighting in court for custody of his more than a dozen children. Lorin Holm was excommunicated from the sect two years ago for being 'unfaithful' and shortly after sued for custody of his children by wives Lynda and Patricia. Holm was one of the 7,500 members of the FLDS church settled in an area between southern Utah and northwestern Arizona. The members of this sect practice plural marriage, which the mainstream Mormon religion abandoned in 1890. Holm still lives with first-wife Helen and their 12 children in Colorado City, Arizona, but his other two wives remained faithful to the sect and now share a new husband who happens to be imprisoned-leader Jeffs' nephew. Scroll down for video . Suing for custody: Former polygamist Lorin Holm is fighting for custody of his children with former wives Lynda and Patricia Peine. His children were taken from him when he was kicked out of the Fundamentalist Mormon church in 2011 . Woman of faith: Holm's former wife Lynda Peine (right) testified in court on Tuesday, saying she fears Holm is a bad influence on their children ever since he was excommunicated from the church . Protection: Holm fears his children will be the victims of sexual abuse, child labor or abandonment if they remain with two of his former wives . Holm is arguing that his children will be the victims of sexual abuse, child labor or abandonment if he isn't awarded sole custody. Holm certainly isn't the first man to be kicked out of the FLDS church and kept from his family. In addition to gaining custody of all 25 of his children, Holm hopes this case will help other men in his position rescue their children from the grasps of the strict sect. 'There’s thousands of families, thousands of children that this will affect,' Holm told Fox 13. 'I want every father and every mother to have their children.' All together: Holm proudly hangs a picture of his united family at his home in Colorado City, Arizona . Standing by her man: Holm was kicked out of the FLDS church in 2011 for being 'unfaithful' and his wives were assigned a new husband. However, first-wife Helen (left) eventually left the church to rejoin him and the two live together with their 12 children . Dad time: Holm has been allowed custody visits with his children from former wives Lynda and Patricia, and he treats them to swimming, pancakes and toys . Loved ones: Holm poses with some female family members in this photo shared on his Facebook page . Meanwhile, Lynda Peine told a judge Tuesday that she doesn't want her children to be around Holm, who she believes is a bad influence, as she fights to retain her custody rights. Holm's attorney Roger Hoole grilled Peine about her religious beliefs, seeking to prove that her faith could come lead to dangerous parenting decisions. 'You’ve also testified that you understand marrying 12-year-olds or 13-year-olds is against the law,' Hoole said. 'If there is a conflict between the laws of God given by Warren Jeffs and the laws of the land, which is supreme in your mind? Which would you follow?' 'The laws of God,' Peine replied. Hoole continued to ask her whether she believed it was OK for an adult male to have sex with an underage girl, as Jeffs preached. 'He never said that, in my hearing,' Peine said. 'I don't believe it.' When Jeffs' sister was brought to the stand to testify about how she had been sexually abused by the prophet when she was just 14, Peine refused to listen - plugging her ears with her fingers. Jeffs is currently serving a life sentence in Texas prison for  sexually assaulting two underage girls he called his 'brides' but he is still the de facto leader of the sect. The prophet: Holm was kicked out of the church with an edict written by de facto leader Warren Jeffs who is currently serving a life sentence in prison. Jeffs recently returned to prison after being hospitalized earlier this month . It was while he was in jail that Holm was excommunicated, per his written edict. Holm received the edict just as he was sitting down for Sunday dinner some three years ago and was told he needed to go to the church for a meeting. At the church he was told he no longer belonged to his family and wasn't allowed to contact them, as they now belonged to Jeffs. Jeffs nephew moved into Holm's 14-bedroom house, took over his business and was named the new husband and father to Holm's three wives and 25 children. But Holm didn't follow the church's orders and returned to his home, where he got a cold welcome. Church leaders informed the family that he was evil and that even talking to their dad would send them to hell. The future: Lorin and Helen Holm hope getting custody of the children will help other ex-fundamentalists in future custody cases . Eventually, his first-wife Helen left the church to be with him, bringing their 12 children, but his other two wives refused to betray Jeffs' orders. In court on Wednesday, Lynda said that while she teaches her children to follow Jeffs' orders, she also tells them to respect Holm and she doesn't know why they call him an apostate. Jeffs himself was called to testify in the custody case, but wasn't allowed to leave his prison in Texas to attend court. Instead Holm's attorney visited Jeffs in prison where he collected a deposition. Hoole described Jeffs as looking 'gaunt, thin, and ashamed'. 'He looks at the ground when you ask him questions about his conduct,' Hoole said. The judge in the custody case is still deciding whether Jeffs' deposition will be allowed in court. Hoole's meeting happened right before Jeffs was transferred to a hospital earlier this month for an illness. True love: Holm shared a romantic picture of he and wife Helen on his Facebook page . It was announced today that Jeffs has been transferred back to prison after his extended stay at a Galveston medical facility. Holm was allowed visitation every other weekend last year when he was interviewed for VICE. While he showed reporters the home he used to share with his three wives, Holm talked about the kids' visits and how they would make pancakes, bounce balls, ride bikes and swim. 'The minute the door shuts they gotta go back across the Berlin wall and pray and read, and read and pray, and that's all they can do,' he said. 'Warren Jeffs isn't a prophet and never was one,' Holm added. 'Warren is not dad. Warren doesn't run my home. I'm the father of my home and God gave me this family. And I'm not going to have a thief take it.' While custody is being decided, the judge has ordered that none of the minor children may marry without the court's consent.","Lorin Holm was kicked out of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ and Ladder-Day Saints in 2011 .

"It's a photo that never fails to shock new visitors to an Australian pub. A man swallowed by a shark has managed to force his arm through the creature's gills and is desperately stabbing it. Presumably still alive inside the shark's stomach, he is able to plunge the knife into the its head in a desperate fight for survival. Scroll down for video . Desperate fight for survival? A picture appears to show a man swallowed whole by a shark frantically trying to release himself by forcing his arm through the creature's gills and stabbing it in the head . In fact the photo has proved to be quite stomach-churning for all who see it for the first time when they walk into the Metung Hotel, in the Gippsland region of Victoria. But all is not as it seems. The unnamed fisherman did catch the shark and he did end up in its stomach. But first he made sure the shark was very dead before he gutted it and then crawled inside its body to prepare for a prank photo that would be taken by one of his friends. The dramatic part came when he then pushed his tattooed arm out through the shark's gills and pretended to be fighting for his life by stabbing the killer fish in the head. Locals, said radio host John Burns of Melbourne's 3AW, who was sent a copy of the photo, refer to the fisherman as the Shark Slayer. 'This fellow has decided as a jape to climb inside the shark with a knife, put his hand through the gills of the shark and pretended to stab it between the eyes,' Mr Burns told his listeners today. Open wide... Of course sharks - even ones as big as the Great white shark pictured here, are better known for biting large chunks off humans they come across rather than swallowing them whole . He then went on to describe the reaction of one pair of visitors. 'An American couple have turned up at the Metung Hotel to see this photo (on the wall) and their immediate response from the wife was ""Did he survive?"",' said Mr Burns. The fisherman happened to be standing behind the couple at the time. Although his response is not known, the Americans might have had the shock of their lives if he'd said: 'Yes, I did!'",The photo hangs in a hotel in the Gippsland region of Victoria .
"For all the facts and stats from the match at Anfield go to our brilliant Match Zone . No longer the circus clowns, Chelsea returned to Anfield as the ringmaster running the show. Jose Mourinho famously refused to accept the bit-part role here back in April, when Chelsea’s 2-0 win at Anfield derailed Liverpool’s title ambitions. Then, the Chelsea manager said he had the suspicion his team were being disregarded as something akin to a peripheral comic turn in Liverpool’s prospective title celebration. He duly sent out an under-strength side to defend assiduously, won the game and hauled down Anfield’s Big Top.

Ratings by DOMINIC KING at Anfield . But seven months on Chelsea are a different proposition. They are now the Premier League’s dominant force - 15 points clear of Liverpool now - while it is Brendan Rodgers who suddenly appears a little exposed. When last week he gambled by leaving seven players out at the Bernabeu – all seven returned  – he appeared to have escaped ignominy with an honourable 1-0 defeat. But on Saturday, when he removed Philippe Coutinho and Emre Can on 70 minutes, boos resounded around Anfield. Rodgers has built up enough goodwill here to survive a brief outburst of frustration but perhaps a slither of belief has been eroded. But Mourinho was able to assume the role to which he is suited: that of dominant alpha male. ‘It was fantastic performance and an expression of ambition,’ he said. ‘In the second half, against Liverpool, at Anfield, every team accepts a point as a good result. 'My team didn’t accept that, so the way they performed in the second half was an expression of that ambition and self-belief they have at the moment. Sometimes you get points and you don’t deserve but this is the case where the best team won.’ Gary Cahill did almost threw away their good work, leaning into a Steven Gerrard shot on 87 minutes with his arm when, when, for the second time in the afternoon, he somehow managed to avoid conceding a penalty. Referee Anthony Taylor did not have one of his finest afternoons. In reality though, by that stage it was rare moment of un-ease for Chelsea even if it understandably irked Rodgers. ‘It’s bitterly disappointing for us,’ he said. ‘It’s a big decision in a big game which we didn’t get and it wasn’t even in doubt, it was a clear, clear handball and the referee had a clear look. My players gave everything today and if they weren’t going to get it from open play they certainly deserved it from the penalty spot. It is a difficult moment for us as we’re not getting the results and it’s been a tough week.’ Yet even when Chelsea fell behind here - and how Anfield roared when they did, hoping that the spirit of 2013-14 could be revived - you never felt that they had lost control of this game. Liverpool were a side seemingly always on the verge of a defensive breakdown, while their visitors appeared to be simply to biding their time to seize victory.

They were better than they have been, especially in those opening exchanges, when they energy of their game did hark back to last season and temporarily disrupted Chelsea’s progress. They started in a frenzy. Emre Can’s first-minute shot was deflected wide by John Terry but when he tried again on nine minutes, Gary Cahill got in the way and diverted it past his keeper and Anfield once again roared with kind of belief that so energised the team last season. This being Chelsea though, they were not swept away by the whirlwind. Cesc Fabregas, who like Ramires was playing with an injury which Mourinho said may cost them games later in the month, took the corner on 14 minutes which was met by Diego Costa who flicked on for John Terry to head from close range. Simon Mignolet produced a superb reaction save and seemed to have done the same from Cahill’s scuffed shot from the rebound. But the goal-line technology showed the ball over the line. Of course, it all occurred in front of the Kop, scene of Luis Garcia’s ghost goal of folklore. This time, however, there was no debate. ‘Everyone knows this is truth and that is fantastic for us as professional and for the crowd, as they know it’s true, and for the referees,’ said Mourinho. The same could not be said for the contentious decisions that followed. Raheem Sterling's mis-hit was stopped by the arm of a diving Cahill on 26 minutes but referee Taylor missed that and Alberto Moreno’s block with his arm on 36 minutes, another clear penalty of the three he should have awarded in the game.

Skrtel (second left) is ushered away by Fabregas at half-time after another clash with Costa (third right, partially obscured) Moreno’s misdemeanour came within an extraordinary spell of Chelsea pressure in which Liverpool simply could not get out of their half. Frustration reached a climax when Gerrard attempted to clear only to collide with Jordan Henderson and Anfield howled with indignation for, at the moment, it felt respite would never come. Blocks from Glen Johnson- at least three – and Dejan Lovren were responsible for holding Chelsea at bay. All the while, Diego Costa and Martin Skrtel were conducting a battle that appeared to be a cross between heavyweight boxing and hand-to-hand wrestling. If ever a team needed half time, it was Liverpool. But they did emerge for the second half somewhat calmer. True they needed a Lovren header to prevent Eden Hazard’s lovely chipped pass reaching Costa. But equally, when Sterling cut inside Ivanovic on 54 minutes, he forced a sharp save from Courtois. The breakthrough came on 66 minutes when Cesar Azpilicueta admirably refused to give up on a lost cause and – just – kept the ball in when chasing down the left wing. He then brushed Philippe Coutinho aside on his way to goal. Mignolet deflected his cross but only into the path of Costa who, inside the penalty area, finished as expected.

"A compound built for notorious cult leader, polygamist and child abuser Warren Jeffs has been turned into a bed and breakfast. Fittingly for a property built for a man who once made the FBI’s list of 10 most wanted fugitives, the guesthouse in Hildale, Utah has been renamed Most Wanted Suites. Construction of the ranch began in 2010 while Jeffs was awaiting trial in Texas for sexual assault and aggravated sexual assault of a child in the hope he would cleared of his crimes and could live there with his wives and children. But the leader of Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints was convicted in 2011 and sentenced to life in prison plus 20 years, with the ranch subsequently seized by the government. Bed and breakfast: Fittingly for a property built for a man who once made the FBI's list of 10 most wanted fugitives, the guesthouse in Hildale, Utah (pictured) has been renamed Most Wanted Suites . Sick: A compound built for notorious cult leader and polygamist Warren Jeffs (pictured left and right) while he was awaiting trial in Texas for sexual assault and aggravated sexual assault of children . After Jeff’s conviction, the newly-built compound was seized by the U.S. government and later put up for auction. The winner of that auction was Willie Jessop – a former member of the church and a confidante of Jeffs, who later sued the group and won. Jessop purchased the ranch with a bid of $3.6million during an auction in April 2013, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. Now he says he is using the guesthouse as a way of helping the local community to come to terms with the past. ‘The initial intent of the [the compound] was to be something exclusive, and the bed and breakfast concept made it something inclusive,’ he told the newspaper. The cost of a stay at Most Wanted Suites is not listed on the company website, but each room comes with a private bathroom, and breakfast will either be served on site or at the Merry Wives Café down the road. Jessops says the best room – a large circular space once intended as a bedroom for Jeffs himself – will be off limits for some time as it is currently being used to house a family whose property recently burned down. Renewal: After Warren Jeff’s 2011 conviction for sexual assault and aggravated sexual assault of children, the newly-built compound was seized by the U.S. government and put up for auction . Women in the sect: The brides of polygamist cult leader Warren Jeffs. He was sentenced to life in prison for the sexual assault of underage girls . The presence of the controversial church is never far from the ranch however, as both Hildale and neighbouring Colorado City in Arizona have high rates of membership. Indeed the opening of the twin towns’ first bed and breakfast is part of a state-sponsored drive to boost a local economy hit by rising unemployment caused by rapidly dwindling membership of the church since Jeffs was jailed. Most Wanted Suites has also already been used for a local function – albeit a reunion for former pupils of a high school run by Jeffs’ church. Jeffs himself was born into the FLDS church, with his father Woodruff Steed the former leader. He was one of at least 60 children of Steed, who was survived by approximately 20 wives. The Utah-based church believes polygamy brings exaltation in heaven and arranged marriages  sometimes involve underage girls. Upon Steed’s death Jeffs married all but two of his wives and instructed them to act as if his father was ‘still alive and in the next room.’ When Jeffs rose to lead the FLDS himself, he was given the title President and Prophet, Seer and Revelator’, and was also referred to a ‘President of the Priesthood.

A 2008 raid on the stronghold revealed the polygamous community which included pregnant child brides in pastel prairie dresses with elaborate braided hairdos . As the sole individual allowed to conduct marriage ceremonies, Jeffs is believed to have been responsible for arranging hundreds of marriages between members. Running the towns as a form of overlord, Jeffs even expelled 20 men – including the mayor – from Colorado City, before ‘reassigning’ their wives. Much of the FLDS’ activity took place on the Yearning for Zion ranch, which is located just outside the town of Eldorado in Texas. It was home to at least 500 members of the controversial church until as recently as April 2014, when the state of Texas seized it on suspicion the property was being used ‘to commit of facilitate certain criminal conduct’.

Jeffs himself was placed on the FBI’s most wanted list in May 2006 after he took flight while facing charges relating to arranging illegal marriages between adult male followers and underage girls. He was arrested three months later in Nevada and hit with eight additional charges, including sexual conduct with minors and incest. Following years of court cases – including a 10-year conviction for rape as an accomplice which was subsequently overturned – Jeffs was finally found guilty of sexual assault and aggravated sexual assault of children and sentenced to life in prison plus 20 years.","Ranch in Hildale, Utah was built while Jeffs awaited child sex abuse trial .

"the State Department set aside a staggering $11,519,617 on hotels and ground transportation costs for President Obama and his entourage to attend Nelson Mandela's memorial service last week, it was revealed today. One contract letter budgeted more than $8.2 million for 'passenger vehicles, SUVs, vans, and buses, as well as supplies and goods vehicles such as pickup trucks, box trucks, and larger capacity vehicles,' according to documents first posted online by the Weekly Standard. Two more authorized State to spend in excess of $3.2 million on hotels from December 6 to January 20, including costs for a whopping 5,730 'hotel room nights' overall – a number that works out to represent more than 127 separate rooms. It's unclear how much the State Department actually spent. But the president, it turned out, spent less . than 13 hours on the ground in South Africa on December 10 – arriving . and departing on the same day. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The shot worth $11m: While Obama gave an address at Mandela's memorial it will always be remembered for this picture. It emerged today for that publicity, the Obama administration was prepared to pony up $11.5 million . The 'beast,' a one-of-a-kind armored SUV that ferries the president around while he's overseas, was brought to South Africa for him -- and its operating costs weren't included in the travel estimates . No-shows: The Obamas did not attend Mandela's actual funeral on Dec. 15, and The Clintons -- who were on the guest list -- never turned up either . It's also unclear whether he or anyone else checked into either of the two hotels named in the contracting documents. Neither Europcar, the rental agency slated to receive the millions for vehicle rental, nor the two hotels named in the State Department authorizations – the Radisson Blu Gautrain and Michaelangelo hotels – would comment on whether they provided services to the U.S. government, or how much they were paid. The State Department also declined to answer questions about the costs of Obama's trip, referring them to the White House. An administration official told MailOnline that it was 'highly unlikely that anyone will be commenting about the president's travel arrangements, considering all the security precautions involved.' When President and Mrs. Obama traveled to South Africa for the Mandela memorial this month, they traveled with administration officials, dignitaries, Secret Service details, a U.S. Air Force contingent and dozens of journalists: . The Clintons returned on their own after Air Force One departed for Washington; media organizations pay for their correspondents' travel lexpenses. Twenty-three members of Congress also attended. While they traveled on a separate plane, their expenses on the ground were reportedly covered by the State Department. 'But federal procurement procedures are what they are, and that's just a system everyone has to work with.' Those procedures are notoriously complex and often involve outlining worst-case scenarios, but it's unlikely anyone would have needed hotel rooms in Johannesburg through the middle of January. Two State Department procurement officers failed to respond to requests for comment about how many taxpayer dollars were actually spent on the excursion. But they also identified four other hotels that met the security and meeting facility requirements of the White House. They included a second Radisson, a Park Inn and a Holiday Inn, all in central Johannesburg near Nelson Mandela Square. None of the awards was open to competitive bidding; the State Department cited 'security concerns' that 'prohibit sufficient advanced notification of VIP travel to allow for sufficient time to conduct full and open competition.' While Mandela's death and memorial service unfolded less than a week apart, the South African anti-apartheid icon was in ill health for more than a year, providing State ample time to plan ahead for contingencies. The contract award document for ground transportation noted that the State Department conducted a 'limited market survey' in 2012, anticipating that it would need logistical support when Mandela finally succumbed to his illnesses. Pricey! When Air Force One took off for South Africa from Andrews Air Force Base, it cost the Defense Department nearly $180,000 per hour to operate -- costs that also weren't included in the $11.5 million travel budget .

Spitting distance: Thamsanqa Jantjie, the mentally unbalanced and violent phony sign-language interpreter, got close enough to President Obama to do him harm . Mandela was laid to rest at his . family home near the South African town of Qunu on December 15. The . Obamas were not slated to attend, but Bill and Hillary Clinton were: . They were ultimately no-shows. Rev. Jesse Jackson, a long-time civil rights movement icon and one-time U.S. presidential candidate, was the most prominent American guest at the . ceremony. The contracts were not open to competitive bidding due to the last-minute nature of travel to a foreign country for a head of state's funeral. The president's unique security requirements when traveling also tend to disqualify most hotels and car services. Obama's armored limousine and emergency helicopter, for instance, typically travel on a military cargo plane that accompanies Air Force One. The president's flagship aircraft itself costs $179,750 per hour to operate, according to a Congressional Research Service report published in May 2012. Somehow the Secret Service's security concerns didn't keep Thamsanqa Jantjie, the infamous fake sign-language interpreter, from standing just feet away from the president during his remarks at Mandela's widely broadcast memorial service. Jantjie, who was hospitalized following a reported nervous breakdown on Thursday, had a history of mental illness and violent crime leading up to his global moment of fame translating Obama's words as 'rocking horses' and 'shrimp' as millions of deaf people looked on in disbelief.","Obama arrived and departed on the same day, spending less than 13 hours on the ground in South Africa for Nelson Mandela's memorial service .

Last week a student provoked complaints by parents after taking a photo of her paltry school meal of lunch meat, a couple crackers, a slice of cheese and two pieces of cauliflower. Kaytlin Shelton, 17, who is eight months pregnant, took a photo of the $3 meal at a Chickasha school  and showed it to her father who said it was not satisfactory. Her father Vince Holton said: 'I can go pay a dollar for a lunchabe and get more food in it. Schools are responsible for children while they're at school.'

"We all know that smoking can cause lung cancer - but did you know it can also trigger women to go grey, grow facial hair and men to have sluggish sperm?

"A convicted sex offender has been arrested for allegedly molesting two sisters, aged 13 and 15, after breaking into their home and threatening them. Rithy Mam, 33, who was previously found guilty of child stalking, had removed his GPS ankle monitor in September before entering the girls' home in Stockton, California. He was later arrested in a public park and is now in custody on felony child molestation charges. Mam committed the crime after being arrested three times in two months last year  on similar accusations. However, he was later released because California's legislation on parolees has been relaxed due to overcrowding in prisons. Beating the system: Convicted sex offender Rithy Mam broke off his GPS device and allegedly molested two sisters in Stockton, California before being rearrested . He is one of thousands of child molesters and rapists . on parole who are getting away with new crimes after disabling their GPS . trackers because they no longer fear lengthy jail time, recent figures . have shown. In the past 18 months, there have been 3,400 . arrest warrants in California, mostly for known sex offenders, after it . was decided that parole violators should be put in county jail and not . state prisons which are bursting to capacity. Although . the study is based solely on California prison statistics, across the . U.S. federal prisons are faced with the constant pressure of . overcrowding, suggesting that similar measures could be introduced . elsewhere. America's prison system is at breaking point - with overcrowding in the nation's jails at its highest for eight years in 2012. There are currently more than two million Americans behind bars. The worst hit state is California which houses 140,000 inmates when its 33 adult prisons are only designed to hold a maximum of 80,000. Overall, the Bureau of Prisons Network is around 39 per cent over 'rated capacity' - their highest level since 2004 - with that figure expected to soar to 45 per cent above its limit by 2018. Before the change to the system, . parolees in California who re-offended were sent to state prison where they could be held up to a year - now many are freed within days or hours of . arrest. The Supreme Court declared California prison overcrowding . unconstitutional in 2011, immediately putting 30,000 convicted criminals up for transfer or release. Repeat offender: Fidel Tafoya, 48, was charged with sexual battery for assaulting a female student at Fresno State University last year. He had been released twice earlier in 2012 on similar accusations . Jack Wallace, from the California Sex Offender Management Board, told the LA Times this week that with little to stop them, 'parolees certainly are feeling more bold'. California law requires that sex offenders wear a GPS device for . life - however there have already been horrifying breaches of the . system. According to the current wanted list . posted online by the California Department of Corrections and . Rehabilitation, there are dozens of offenders who have violated the . conditions of their parole by tampering with GPS monitors. Alarms go off when snapped, smashed or when a sex offender gets too close to a school or playground. In Fresno County, 42 sex offenders broke parole in the last 18 months. In one incident, sex offender Fidel Tafoya, 48, was arrested on a college campus for assaulting a female student in the library. Little threat: Now that California is no longer placing parole violators in state prison, many no longer have prison time to fear and are cutting off GPS ankle monitors (stock picture) He was arrested on November 14 last year but had been released twice in 2012 on similar allegations. The repeat offender remains in custody charged with sexual battery to which he has pleaded not guilty. Proposals have been put forward by lawmakers that would require parolees who damage their GPS bracelets to go back to jail for three years. However critics, point to the fact that there are simply no cells in the prison system to hold these offenders.","Supreme Court declared California prison overcrowding .

"The report by Hope Not Hate, said Anjem Choudary, above, should be considered a 'major player' in international Islamism . Groups linked to hate preacher Anjem Choudary have been labelled, the 'single biggest gateway to terrorism in recent British history'. The radical Islamist has been identified as the link between groups who encourage the safe passage of British and European Muslims into Syria where they join Al Qaeda-linked forces. According to a study by Hope Not Hate, organisations affiliated with Choudary have encouraged in the region of 80 young British Muslims to join the fighting in Syria. They may also have had a hand in the recruitment of 300 more on the continent, the report said. As well as highlighting Choudary role in encouraging young Muslims to fight in Syria, the report also established a connection between the preacher's al-Muhajiroun network and high profile terrorists, including those repsonsible for the 7/7 London bombings. The report recommends that Mr Choudary should be considered a 'serious player' in the promotion and recruitment of young Muslims to terrorist cells. Previously, the father-of-four from Leytonstone in East London has made statements about how he would like to see the Prime Minister David Cameron and the American President Barack Obama killed. Despite his bile-filled speeches and controversial views, the 46-year-old has only ever been fined £500 by the authorities. That action came after he organised a protest outside the Danish embassy in London over cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed. But the latest investigation will raise fresh questions about Choudary's influence in the radicalisation of British Muslims who go on to carry out acts of terrorism. Speaking to The Independent, a spokesman for Hope Not Hate, said supporters of the preacher were currently in Syria 'in numbers'. They said: 'Al-Muhajiroun supporters from London, Birmingham, Luton and Stoke-on-Trent have all definitely gone. Choudary has previously made hate-filed statements in which he said he would like David Cameron to be killed . 'While painted by some as a figure of fun, an extremist crackpot whose media stunts are rightly ridiculed, Anjem Choudary has become a serious player on the international Islamist scene . 'Perhaps it is time to start concentrating on his role as a facilitator of terror. Al-Muhajiroun has quite simply been the single biggest gateway to terrorism in recent British history.' Choudhary has previously been identified as a leading British influence for the Al Qaeda-linked . terrorists who carried out the Kenya shopping mall atrocity. He featured significantly in a video issued by the East African group and was was lauded as a ‘Caller to Islam’, marking the first time that he has been publicly endorsed by Al Qaeda. It suggested that he and a militant colleague based in North-West London are the main points of contact for Muslims eager to wage jihad in Somalia or Britain. In the clip, Choudary is seen blaming British foreign policy for terrorist attacks in the UK and warning of more attacks. Speaking in the video, thought to be taken from the internet, he says: ‘The Government want people to swallow something that is completely nonsensical, it doesn’t make any sense: their foreign policy has had a direct impact on the streets of London.’","Investigation finds the London-based extremist encouraged Brits join cells .

"At least 42 people were killed and another 11 taken to hospital after their plane crashed and caught fire while trying to make an emergency landing in stormy weather on a small Taiwanese island. 'We have found 42 bodies and some body parts so far,' an official from the Penghu county fire department told AFP. Taiwanese Transport Minister Yeh Kuang-shih was quoted as saying the flight, operated by Taiwan's TransAsia Airways, was carrying 58 passengers and crew members. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Scroll down for video . Rescue workers next to the wreckage of TransAsia Airways flight GE222 which crashed while attempting to land in stormy weather on the Taiwanese island of Penghu . At least 42 people were killed and another 11 taken to hospital after the plane crashed and caught fire while trying to make an emergency landing in stormy weather . 'There were 58 people on board including four crew members, four children,' he told reporters earlier. The government's Central News Agency news agency had earlier quoted a local fire brigade chief as saying that 51 people had been killed. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade confirmed no Australians appear to have been on board the plane,  based on initial advice. Two French nationals were on board the plane and the de facto French embassy had been notified, Yeh said. Flight GE222, a twin-engine turboprop ATR-72 aircraft, was heading from the southern port city of Kaohsiung to the island of Penghu in the Taiwan Strait, according to the Taiwanese news agency. Flight GE222, a twin-engine turboprop ATR-72 aircraft, was heading from the southern port city of Kaohsiung to the island of Penghu in the Taiwan Strait, according to the Taiwanese news agency . Firefighters damp down the wreckage of the jet . It crashed outside the airport in Xixi village, with pictures in local media showing firefighters using flashlights to look at wreckage in the darkness. 'It's chaotic on the scene,' Jean Shen, director of the civil aviation authorities, told Reuters. 'The fire department was putting out the flames. They will give us the number of casualties very soon.' Penghu is a lightly populated island that averages about two flights a day from Taipei. The flight left Kaohsiung at 4.53 p.m. for Magong on Penghu, according to Shen. Visibility as the plane approached was 1,600 meters (one mile), which met standards for landing, and two flights had landed before GE222, one at 5.34 p.m. and the other at 6.57 p.m., the agency reported. But it appeared that heavy rain reduced visibility and the plane was forced to pull up and make a second landing attempt, the report cited the county fire department as saying.

A portion of the wing lies amid houses in the village on Penghu island . At 7.06 p.m., after saying it would make a second attempt at a landing, the plane lost contact with the tower. It failed to reach the runway, crashing onto houses in a village. First reports from eyewitnesses described a huge ball of fire erupting when the aircraft hit. Typhoon Matmo slammed into Taiwan on Wednesday with heavy rains and strong winds, shutting financial markets and schools. The flight had been delayed earlier by bad weather as the typhoon pounded the country. Shen said the plane was 14 years old. TransAsia Airways is a Taiwan-based airline with a fleet of 23 mostly Airbus aircraft, flying chiefly on domestic routes, but with some flights to Japan, Thailand and Cambodia among its Asian destinations. There were no immediate reports of casualties on the ground after the plane smashed into houses in the village of Sisi, a couple of kilometres from Magong airport. Firefighters battered by rain and heavy winds carry a woman away from the crash site . An injured passenger is helped by rescuers to get into an ambulance . 'I heard a loud sound and my instinct was that it's a plane crash,' a villager surnamed Wang was quoted as saying by the Apple Daily Newspaper website after the plane crashed next to his home and damaged his house. Wang said he smelt gasoline and saw some passengers with blood on their faces and bodies brought out of the plane. Shen earlier said 51 were feared dead in the crash, but later revised the figure to 47. 'The control tower lost contact with the aircraft soon after they requested a go-around (second attempt to land),' Shen told reporters. Local fire chief Hung Yung-peng told TVBS there were 11 survivors, with all others on board feared dead. 'The weather was bad and some witnesses said there were storms and lightning when the plane went down,' said Hung. 'We rushed 12 people to hospitals soon after our arrival. One died at the hospital. We kept searching for the other passengers from the wreckage but with more and more bodies pulled out, I'm afraid the rest of them might be dead,' Hung said.

TransAsia Airways president Chooi Yee-choong bowed in front of television cameras to apologise for the accident. An airline official speaking on local television identified the pilot as 60-year-old Lee Yi-liang and co-pilot Chiang Kuan-hsin, 39, saying they had both accumulated more than 20,000 flight hours. 'He worked so hard to become a pilot, who can give me my brother back,' Chiang's sister was quoted as saying by the Central News Agency. French-Italian aircraft manufacturer ATR said the plane was manufactured in June 2000. 'At this time, the circumstances of the accident are still under investigation,' it said in a statement, adding that the Aviation Safety Council of Taiwan would be in charge of the probe. A scooter makes its way through heavy rainfall as Typhoon Matmo hits Taiwan, in Fuzhou, Fujian province, today . President Ma Ying-jeou's office said it was a 'very sad day in Taiwan's aviation history'. 'All Taiwanese people feel the sorrow and will provide the survivors and families of the deceased the biggest support and assistance,' it said in a statement. 'President Ma Ying-jeou is very saddened... and has instructed relevant units to clarify the case soon.' Chinese President Xi Jinping was 'deeply grieved' and extended his condolences to relatives of the victims, the official Xinhua news agency reported. Beijing also offered to provide assistance to its neighbour, and former bitter rival.

"Germany would rather see Britain leave the EU than allow David Cameron to tear up its rules on free movement of labour, Angela Merkel has said. The Chancellor warned the Prime Minister that he is reaching a ‘point of no return’ by pushing for reform of the bloc’s sacred free movement system. The threat has forced Mr Cameron to tone down his ambitions for any deal to curb EU immigration. Scroll down for videos . Germany would rather see Britain leave the EU than change rules on free movement of labour, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said . The pair clashed at a summit in Brussels last month, German magazine Der Spiegel said. Citing senior officials, it said Mrs Merkel told Mr Cameron he was nearing a ‘point of no return’ with plans to introduce quotas for the number of EU workers who can come to Britain. She threatened to abandon her efforts to keep Britain in the EU unless he backed down. One government insider was quoted on Radio Bavaria saying: ‘The time for talking is close to over. ‘Mrs Merkel feels she has done all she can to placate the UK, but will not accept immigration curbs from EU member states under any circumstances. It has come to a Mexican stand-off and it is now a question of who blinks first.’ Mrs Merkel was confident of winning the battle of wills, the insider added. It came amid reports that Mr Cameron is ditching his quota plan to appease Berlin. Ministers will focus on making the existing rules work better for Britain. A source said Mr Cameron’s plans – to be outlined before Christmas – would stretch EU rules ‘to their limits’. Nigel Farage said David Cameron could not win significant renegotiation from Brussels because the German Chancellor would block him . National Insurance numbers (NINOs) have been handed out to more than 420,000 people from the EU, up from 285,000 in the year before the coalition was formed . One proposal would ban EU migrants coming to Britain unless they had a job to go to. Anyone unable to support themselves would be deported after three months. It is thought the Prime Minister will seek Mrs Merkel’s approval before announcing any changes. Government sources did not dispute the Spiegel reports last night. They stressed that Mrs Merkel is still publicly voicing support for both the EU’s free movement rules and Britain’s membership of the EU. A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘The Prime Minister will do what is right for Britain, as he has repeatedly made clear.’ But critics said Mrs Merkel’s warning demonstrated the weakness of Mr Cameron’s position. Eurosceptic Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said: ‘It is looking increasingly unlikely that it will be possible to get a successful renegotiation. The chart shows the monstrous bill handed to the UK by the EU in comparison with other member states . 'I’m afraid it leaves me very suspicious about what the Prime Minister is trying to do. Signing up to the European Arrest Warrant raises questions about whether he even wants a successful renegotiation. ‘On immigration I think there is a question about whether he is making statements he can actually deliver.’ Ukip leader Nigel Farage said: ‘The only logical next step is to abandon the renegotiation and announce an immediate referendum.’ Former Tory minister Kenneth Clarke said Mr Cameron ‘knows perfectly well’ that free movement is essential to the EU. He told the BBC’s Sunday Politics: ‘All our companies, multinational companies, will go spare if you start interfering with that.’ Meanwhile, a study found that the UK is the most ‘prosperous’ major EU country – but still less successful than Norway and Switzerland, outside the bloc. The Prosperity Index by the Legatum Institute think-tank ranks 142 countries on economic and social factors. The UK came 13th, just ahead of Germany. Norway was top overall, beating Switzerland and New Zealand . Labour should apologise for lifting border restrictions on eastern European immigrants, a former aide to Gordon Brown has said. Ian Austin, a minister in Mr Brown’s government said Labour should ‘be honest’ and ‘say sorry’ for opening the borders to Eastern Europeans in 2004. He said: ‘If you make a mistake, you should say sorry. Let’s be honest about it. ‘It was a mistake. I said so at the time. I did not think it was the right thing to do. ‘What we have to do now is understand people’s concerns and come up with ideas that will address that.’","Germany would rather Britain leave the EU than change rules on migration .

"Mitt Romney lost the election after an ‘extraordinary’ collapse in support among white men, the very group the Republicans counted on to turn out for him. As the official inquest into the defeat got underway, the former Presidential candidate’s own pollster revealed his lead among white males was cut from 27 points to as low as 12 points. Staff revealed that nobody had even read Clint Eastwood’s speech at the Republican National Convention which caused them deep embarrassment. Failed campaign: Mitt Romney's staff found that he lost an 'extraordinary' number of white, male votes during the election - traditionally key supporters of the Republican party . And in another blow, Romney’s own campaign manager also admitted that his infamous 47 per cent comment was ‘the epitome of low during the campaign’ - from which they never recovered. After his defeat Romney was rounded on by the Republican party which blamed him for his defeat to President Obama by a margin of 332 to 206 electoral college votes. The President lost just two states compared to his landslide in 2008. Romney has spent the last month in solitude at his beachfront mansion in La Jolla near San Diego in California as he reflects upon what went wrong. Now Neil Newhouse, his campaign pollster, has begun to sift through the data to determine what the key factors were. He said that he had to give ‘credit’ to the Obama campaign for getting out the Latino and African- American vote, and praised the President’s so-called ‘ground game’ for being extremely effective. He said: ‘We weren’t surprised by racial composition; we were surprised by the partisan composition...The . real hidden story here on our side, the number of white men who didn’t . vote in this election compared to four years ago was extraordinary. On good terms: The President and Mitt Romney shake on it after their grueling election campaigns ended with Obama back in the White House . ‘And . these white men were replaced by white women. We were taking a group we . won by 27 points and replacing them with a group we won by 12-14 . points.’ Speaking to ABC News, Romney strategist and RNC director Russ Schrieffer admitted that Eastwood’s speech had not been cleared. The . Dirty Harry star went on to make a bizarre, rambling appearance in . which he talked to an empty chair, pretending it was President Obama. The speech was much lampooned and overshadowed Romney, who came on stage immediately afterwards. Schrieffer said: ‘I said [to . Eastwood] are you going to do what we talked about, are you going to . talk about what you talked about at these fundraisers. And he looked at . me and said.. ‘Yep.’ ‘It’s Clint Eastwood, you argue with him.’ Rambles: Clint Eastwood's bizarre speech at the Republican National Convention in August, where he addressed a chair as Obama, overshadowed Romney's appearance, staff said .

"Google Now has added an alarm feature (pictured) that automatically calculates when a user needs to alight public transport . Most people have fallen asleep on a train or bus after a long day at work or a party, only to find they have missed their stop and face a hefty taxi fare home. But a new feature on Google Now could put an end to such misery and enable people to take a nap without worrying about the consequences. Google has added an alarm to its service that already voluntarily offers people information about the weather, their journey and upcoming appointments. And the new system means the service can now automatically calculate when to set an alarm based on saved locations such as home and work, plus public transport information, Android Police reported. The alarm ‘knows’ how long the journey should last and when the users should get off the bus or train. By tapping the screen, the alarm will wake them  up in time for their stop. and save a long walk home or that costly taxi ride. The . service is only available in select areas where transport information is available, and works for users of Android . smartphones and tablets as well as iPhones and iPads. This update follows the release of public transports routes across the UK last month. Google updated its Maps service to include an extra 17,000 public transport routes nationally. Google Maps with Public Transport now shows routes, departures and interchanges for buses, trains, tubes, trams and ferries across the UK, pictured. The recent update added 17,000 new comparable routes to make it easier to decide whether walking, driving or taking the bus is quicker . The app sums up activity, such as how far the user has walked. It checks traffic ahead of any appointments they have in their phone's calendar. It reminds them about restaurant reservations, events and birthdays. The alarm feature stops users missing their bus or train stop. The app can suggest destinations they might like, suggest photo spots and translate languages. National rail data and public transport information is already available on Google Maps in cities, including London, but this latest update extended it to the rest of the country. Google Maps for Public Transport now features route details for buses, trains, tubes, trams and ferries. It shows real-time departures and reveals how many interchanges there will be. For each journey, the app compares all the available routes via the different transport modes, including walking and driving, to see which is the quickest or easiest.","The Google Now feature automatically calculates when to set an alarm based on saved locations such as home and work .

"Billions poured into foreign aid by Britain is doing harm, casting doubt on the PM's pledge to spend 0.7% of national income on overseas aid . The billions Britain pours into foreign aid are actually doing harm by making corruption worse in many parts of the world, a damning report reveals. It says projects funded by UK cash are increasing opportunities for bribery. In some areas, they are even pushing poor people ‘towards corrupt practices’. After we spent millions on a scheme to tackle police bribery in Nigeria, locals said they were even more likely to have to pay backhanders, the report found. It concluded that huge amounts of UK aid money is being wasted because we are either funding corrupt programmes directly or not doing enough to tackle the culture of bribery in many countries. The findings come just days after it emerged human rights abuses in Ethiopia – where security forces are accused of burning, torturing and raping citizens – had got worse during a four-year period when the UK gave the country more than £1billion. They will be hugely embarrassing for David Cameron, who has repeatedly been forced to defend his controversial commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on overseas aid despite fierce opposition from his backbenchers. The report was carried out by the Independent Commission for Aid Impact, the watchdog set up to scrutinise the Department for International Development. Giving DfiD a poor ‘amber-red’ rating, it criticised the fact that only £22million of its £10.3billion aid budget was targeted specifically at fighting corruption. The study found the department was not ‘up to the challenge’ of tackling corruption and, in many cases, help was not effectively targeted at the poor. In Nepal, it said the poor were being ‘pushed towards corrupt practices’ by having to pay bribes or forge documents to receive funding through a local governance project backed by British aid. Labour accused Justine Greening, the Secretary of State for International Development, of being ‘asleep at the wheel’. Graham Ward, chief commissioner at the ICAI, said: ‘We saw very little evidence that the work DfID is doing to combat corruption is successfully addressing the impact of corruption as experienced by the poor.’ The Coalition has massively increased Britain’s aid budget in recent years in a bid to plough 0.7 per cent of national income into overseas development. This happened despite savage cuts to public services at home and opposition from Tory backbenchers. The ICAI report found corruption blights the everyday lives of the very poorest and thwarts global efforts to lift countries out of poverty. It said while DfID claims to recognise the need to tackle corruption, it ‘has not delivered an approach equal to the challenge’. The study also found the department was often lax in tackling corruption as it was worried about offending local politicians. ‘DfID’s willingness to engage in programming that explicitly tackles corruption is often constrained by political sensitivity,’ it said. Labour accused Justine Greening, the Secretary of State for International Development, of being ‘asleep at the wheel’ ‘In Nigeria, petty corruption touches virtually every aspect of life and is accepted throughout society as normal and necessary. We heard stories of parents paying bribes to teachers in order to educate their children; students paying bribes to administrators to take exams; workers paying bribes to get jobs and to receive their salaries; and pensioners paying bribes to receive pensions.’ The report found that in Nepal, there is a ‘growing sense of acceptance of corruption across society’. Where once bribes were paid out of sight, they are now paid openly. Britain gives money direct to the Nepalese government, despite the risk of corruption.The report said: ‘This degree of engagement with a host government can be challenging, given the extent to which issues of corruption touch the government.’ It added: ‘Very few of DfID’s activities we reviewed in Nepal, Nigeria and elsewhere explicitly focus on the everyday corruption experienced by the poor.’ The report added: ‘Disappointingly, we found that at least one programme supported by DfID appears to have increased the opportunities for corruption in society.’ Alison McGovern, Labour’s spokesman for international development, said: ‘This damning report should send shockwaves through David Cameron’s government. Justine Greening should have zero tolerance of corruption – especially when it is hitting the poorest – but instead the Independent Commission has found her asleep at the wheel.’ A DfID spokesman said: ‘We have anti-corruption and counter-fraud plans for each country that we give bilateral aid to. ‘Additionally, DfID funds UK police units and crime agencies to investigate the proceeds of corruption by foreign officials through the UK.’","Projects funded by billions of UK cash increase opportunities for bribery .

"A mother-of-three and fitness instructor could be on track to become the first black female member of Congress. Mia Love, who is also a Mormon and mayor of a small town in Utah, has stunned political analysts by winning her primary election. If she wins her congressional election, the 36-year-old will make political history as the first black Republican woman to serve in Congress. 'Unprecedented': Political analysts have described Mia Love's achievements as 'astonishing' Love's victory in the primaries has stunned many in Utah, not least because it is a state in which only three women have been elected into Congress and has an African American population of less than 1 per cent, latest census figures show. She is taking on six-term congressman Jim Matheson, who currently holds the distinction of being a Democrat representing one of the most Republican districts in the country. Their political battle has become one of the most closely-watched congressional contests in the U.S. According to The Root, Tim Chambless, an associate professor of political science at the University of Utah's Hinckley Institute of Politics, described Love's feat as 'astonishing' and 'unprecedented'. One High School teacher who met Love said that she was impressed with her stance on 'dismantling entitlements', the Daily Herald reported. Roots: Love was born in Brooklyn and raised in Connecticut before settling in the state of Utah (pictured) 14 years ago . Elaine Grant said she was switching political allegiance from Matheson to Love after meeting the candidate. She told the Daily Herald: 'There's . this perception that there aren't any African Americans in Utah and a . mis-perception that there are no African American Mormons. 'She dispels some of that. That's a good thing.' Love was born in Brooklyn and raised in Connecticut before settling in Utah 14 years ago. She met her future husband, Jason Love, in college while he was on a Mormon mission in Connecticut. When she moved to the state she left the Catholic Church and joined the Church of the Latter-Day Saints.",Mormon and small-time mayor could make history as the first black Republican woman in Congress .
"President Barack Obama came out swinging on Wednesday just 14 hours after a Republican wave swept over the U.S. Congress in an election that largely repudiated his policies. 'Congress will pass some bills I cannot sign,' he said, threatening to dust off a veto pen that he has used only twice in nearly six years. And he hinted at executive orders that will enrage conservatives. 'I'm pretty sure I'll take some actions that some in Congress will not like,' he said. 'That's natural. That's how Democracy works.' Much of reporters' tussling with the president focused on executive orders related to immigration reform – what some tea party Republicans call an 'amnesty' – which he plans to implement this year. He acknowledged that the GOP won Tuesday's elections, but framed the results as a mandate for Republicans to work with him, instead of the other way around. 'Obviously the Republicans had a good night,' he said. Scroll down for video . STUNG BUT SWINGING: Obama insisted that he won't budge on immigration and other key issues despite Republicans' 'wave' election on Tuesday . FULL HOUSE: Reporters crowded into the White House's East Room to hear President Barack Obama react to his party's Tuesday night electoral drubbing . NEW COLD WARRIOR? Kentucky Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell (left) seized control of Democrats' previous congressional stronghold on Tuesday, but Obama behaved as though his party won . But he said he would principally work with them 'if there are ideas that the Republicans have that I am confident will make things better for ordinary Americans.' 'I want to just see what works,' he said. 'The American people sent a message,' he claimed, 'one that they've sent for several elections now.' 'They expect the people they elect to work as hard as they do. They expect us to focus on their ambitions, and not ours.' He then rattled off a list of economic indicators that he said buttressed his case that Republicans should accept his point of view. 'More Americans are working. Unemployment has come down,' he claimed, glossing over the part-time employment shift that the Obamacare law's employer mandate has ushered in. 'Our economy is outpacing most of the world. But we've just gotta keep at it. Much of that will take action from Congress. And I'm eager to work with the next Congress.' He cited infrastructure building projects and international trade as areas where he thought his agenda overlaps with the GOP's. Responding to hot-button questions about the fate of Obamacare in the age of a Republican Congress, the president didn't budge. He said he would only work with Republicans if they seek to 'make responsible changes' to the law. 'I'm going to be very receptive to hearing those ideas.' 'Despite all the contention,' Obama claimed, 'we now know that the law works.' And he pledged to avoid last year's chronic website snafus the next time around. 'We're really making sure the website works super well before the next open enrollment period,' he said. 'We're double- and triple'checking it.' Addressing his relationship with the new Senate majority leader, Obama chuckled at a question about whether he might sit down with him for a drink. 'I would enjoy having some Kentucky bourbon with Mitch McConnell,' the president said. 'He has always been very straightforward with me. To his credit, he has never made a promise that he couldn't deliver. And he knows the legislative process well. He obviously know his caucus well.' 'What I'm not gonna do is just wait,' Obama said, pledging to take executive action on immigration by year's end . McConnell, he told reporters, has 'always given me realistic assessments of what he can get through his caucus and what he can't, so I think we can have a productive relationship.' Obama also announced that he has sent Congress a funding request for $6.18 billion in new funds to fight the Ebola crisis at home and in Africa. And he surprised many by saying he would ask Congress for a new Authorization for Use of Military Force to help him prosecute a flagging war against the self-described Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS), the terror army that has slaughtered indiscriminately in its quest for a regional caliphate. The move is a 180-degree turn from he administration's previous position that a George W. Bush-era congressional permission slip was more than adequate to deal with turmoil in Iraq and Syria. 'We now have a different type of enemy,' Obama said Wednesday, echoing Republicans' objections months ago. 'The strategy is different.' ''It makes sense for us to make sure that the authorization from Congress reflects what we perceive to be not just out strategy over the next two to three months,' he said, but also our strategy moving forward. The president also challenged the lame-duck Congress, with a Senate still run by the election-wounded Nevada Democrat Harry Reid, to 'pass a budget for the rest of the fiscal year' in just five weeks, and to do it in a 'bipartisan, drama-free way.' And he didn't budge on immigration, despite the second midterm election shellacking of his presidency. What landslide? Obama didn't acknowledge a single policy where he would shift his point of view to align with the new Republican congressional majority . 'I have consistently said that it is my profound preference and interest to see Congress act on a comprehensive immigration reform bill,' Obama said. That sort of bill passed the Senate in 2013 but was dead on arrival in the House. With a larger Republican majority in the House and a newly minted Senate majority as well, that plan seems even less likely to succeed now. Obama pledged to 'do everything I can in my executive authority' to take 'whatever lawful actions that I can take that I believe will improve our immigration system.' And he dared the GOP to see things his way. Executive orders, he said, 'will be replaced and supplanted by a bill from Congress.' 'You send me a bill that I can sign and those executive actions go away. But he cautioned: 'What I'm not gonna do is just wait.'","'Congress will pass some bills I cannot sign,' the president warned .
He has only vetoed  two minor bills since his inauguration in 2009 .
And 'I'll take some actions that some in Congress will not like,' Obama added, referring to threatened executive orders .
Those include a bold move on immigration 'before the end of the year'

"These are the faces of six of the thousands of innocent Yazidi children who have suffered harrowing ordeals in Iraq this month. Up to 3,000 women and girls have been kidnapped by Islamic State jihadis in the north of the country in just a fortnight - and hundreds of men who refuse to convert have been shot dead. The kidnappings appear to have happened in villages where residents took up arms against IS - and the women are being held separately from the men in IS-controlled Tal Afar, east of Mount Sinjar.

Some 200,000 people escaped to safety in Iraq's Kurdish region, but others remain on the mountain. Donatella Rovera, Amnesty International's senior crisis response adviser, told the Agence France-Presse news agency: ‘The victims are of all ages, from babies to elderly men and women.’ ‘It seems they took away entire families, all those who did not manage to flee. We fear the men may have been executed.’ Two women - Leila Khalaf and Wadhan Khalaf - were among those kidnapped from Mujamma Jazira village, said their relative Dakhil Atto Solo. He added that the abductions happened after residents tried to resist the IS attack, telling AFP: ‘Of course we tried to defend our villages, but they had much bigger weapons. ‘All we had were our Kalashnikovs. They executed 300 men, and took the women to their prisons.  Only God can save them now.’ Their children, said Mr Solo, were rescued by the family.

Now, the children cry for their mothers all the time. ""Mama, mama,"" they wail. But there is no mama, we tell them.’ His comments on the dire situation came as Islamic extremists shot dead scores of Yazidi men, lining them up in small groups and opening fire with assault rifles before seizing their wives and children. 'The victims are of all ages, from babies to elderly men and women. It seems they took away entire families, all those who did not manage to flee. We fear the men may have been executed' Donatella Rovera, Amnesty International . A Yazidi politician cited the mass killing in Kocho as evidence that his people were still at risk after a week of US and Iraqi air strikes on the militants. Meanwhile, warplanes targeted insurgents around a large dam that was captured by the IS extremist group earlier this month. US Central Command said the strikes were launched under the authority to support humanitarian efforts in Iraq, as well as to protect US staff and facilities. Central Command says the nine air strikes conducted so far had destroyed or damaged four armoured personnel carriers, seven armed vehicles, two Humvees and an armoured vehicle. The US began strikes against IS a week ago, in part to prevent the massacre of tens of thousands of Yazidis in northern Iraq. Yazidis fled the militants by scrambling up a barren mountain, where they became stranded . Displaced Iraqi Christians and Yazidis settle at the Diocese of Zakho, 300 miles north-west of Baghdad, Iraq . They fled the militants by scrambling up a barren mountain, where they became stranded. Most were eventually able to escape with help from Kurdish fighters. IS fighters surrounded the nearby village 12 days ago and demanded that its Yazidi residents convert or die. On Friday afternoon, they moved in. 'All we had were our Kalashnikovs. They executed 300 men, and took the women to their prisons. Only God can save them now' Dakhil Atto Solo, relative of kidnapped women . The militants told people to gather in a school, promising they would be allowed to leave Kocho after their details were recorded, said an eyewitness and the brother of the Kocho mayor, Nayef Jassem. The militants separated the men from the women and children under 12. They took men and male teens away in groups of a few dozen each and shot them on the edge of the village, according to a wounded man who escaped by feigning death. The fighters then walked among the bodies, using pistols to finish off anyone who appeared to still be alive, the 42-year-old man said from an area where he was hiding. ‘They thought we were dead, and when they went away, we ran away. We hid in a valley until sundown, and then we fled to the mountains,’ he said. Displaced Yazidis who fled the violence in the Iraqi town of Sinjar march in a demonstration at the Iraqi-Turkish border crossing in Zakho district of the Dohuk Governorate of the Iraqi Kurdistan province . Demonstrators demanded protection and evacuation from Iraq to safer areas such as Europe and the US . A Yazidi politician, a Kurdish security official and an Iraqi official from the nearby city of Sinjar gave similar accounts, saying Islamic State fighters had massacred many Yazidi men on Friday after seizing Kocho. 'They thought we were dead, and when they went away, we ran away. We hid in a valley until sundown, and then we fled to the mountains' Man who escaped from militants . All said they based their information on the accounts of survivors. Their accounts matched those of two other Yazidi men, Qassim Hussein and Nayef Jassem, who said they spoke to other survivors. It was not clear precisely how many men were killed. Iraqi and Kurdish officials said at least 80 men were shot. Yazidi residents said they believed the number was higher, because there were at least 175 families in Kocho, and few were able to escape before the militants surrounded their hamlet. Yesterday Britain deployed a US-made spy plane over northern Iraq to monitor the humanitarian crisis and movements of the militants. The converted Boeing KC-135 tanker, called a Rivet Joint, was monitoring mobile phone calls and other communication.","Innocent Yazidi children have suffered harrowing ordeals in northern Iraq .

"An Islamic group shot dead a Syrian 14-year-old boy in front of his parents for blasphemy after overhearing him say he 'wouldn't even give the Prophet a free coffee.' Mohammad Qataa was shot in the face and neck a day after being seized by members of an Al Qaeda-linked Islamist group in the northern Syrian city of Aleppo, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. A photo released by the Observatory . showed Qataa's face with his mouth and jaw bloodied and destroyed as . well as a bullet wound in his neck. Scroll down for video . A picture taken from a video uploaded on YouTube by the Aleppo Media Centre allegedly shows 14-year-old Mohammad Qataa (right) who was killed by insurgents for apparently insulting the Prophet Mohammad . An image grab taken from Syria's official television channel al-Ikhbariya reportedly shows the body of 14-year old Mohammad after he was shot dead . Today it emerged Qataa was working as a street vendor in the al-Shaa district of Aleppo when three members of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, a militant . group that started off known as the Nusra Front, overheard him arguing with a friend over a bill. It is thought the boy had given his friend a coffee which the friend wanted to pay for later. 'Mohammad Qataa was working at his street trolley and remarked to his friend that even if the Prophet Mohammad came down he would not give him credit,' said Rami Abdulrahman, who heads the UK-based human rights group, told The Times. The three fighters overheard and accused the teenager of blasphemy and insulting the prophet. The . gunmen took Qataa on Saturday . and brought him back alive in the early hours of Sunday to his wooden . stand, with whiplash marks visible on his body. This picture from a video released by the Aleppo Media Centre reportedly shows Mohammad's parents who watched as their son was shot dead in the street by an Al Qaeda-linked group . Qataa's parents said the youth had taken part in pro-democracy demonstrations in Aleppo . The gunmen belonged to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, a militant group that started off known as the Al-Nusra Front (file picture) The United Nations refugee agency is talking to Germany about resettling up to 10,000 Syrian refugees, UNHCR spokesman Adrian Edwards said on Tuesday. UNHCR was also working with other European governments to find ways to resettle some of the 1.6million Syrians who have fled the country, a number the United Nations expects to reach 3.45million by the end of 2013, Edwards said. The UN agency plans to hold a meeting on the subject with governments around the end of June in Geneva, but details and the participants were not yet known, he said. Specific numbers had not yet been discussed with other countries. However, resettlement is only an option for the most vulnerable cases and the bulk of the refugee burden will still fall on four of Syria's neighbours: Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and Iraq. People gathered around him and a member . of the fighting brigade said: 'Generous citizens of Aleppo, disbelieving . in God is polytheism and cursing the prophet is a polytheism. Whoever . curses even once will be punished like this.' 'He then fired two bullets from an . automatic rifle in view of the crowd and in front of the boy's mother . and father, and got into a car and left,' the report said. Abdulrahman . said the boy's mother had pleaded with the killers, whose Arabic . suggested they might not be Syrian, not to shoot her son. 'The Observatory cannot ignore these . crimes, which only serve the enemies of the revolution and the enemies . of humanity,' said Rami Abdulrahman. Qataa's parents said the youth had taken part in pro-democracy demonstrations in Aleppo. Since . last year, large parts of the city have fallen under the control of . Islamist brigades, including the Al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, as well as . other rebel units. Britain and France worked together last . month to lift a European Union embargo on arms shipments to Syrian . rebels, giving them the flexibility to send weapons to forces against . President Bashar Assad. Foreign Secretary William Hague said on . Sunday that no such decision had yet been taken and promised for the . first time to give lawmakers a vote in parliament if and when it was. But . Prime Minister David Cameron's government is split on the issue, with . some ministers fearing such a move could worsen the bloodshed and drag . Britain into a protracted conflict. It also raises concerns that weapons could be used by Islamist extremists to commit atrocities like this most recent execution. And in a surprising development today, Russian President Vladimir Putin admitted al-Assad could have avoided the bloody civil war by responding more quickly to demands for change. In comments to Russia's English-language state television network RT, Putin repeated that Russia is not acting as an advocate for Assad but broadly blamed the West for violent upheaval in the Middle East. Meanwhile, two suicide bombers hit a . central Damascus square today, killing at least 14 people, activists and . the state media reported. Activists said one of the explosions took place inside the police station there and that many among the dead were policemen.

The official said another 31 were wounded. The state-TV Ikhbariya TV station showed footage of broken shop facades and mangled cars in the central square as ambulance workers were seen carrying the wounded on stretchers. The attacks in the capital are the first since government troops, backed by fighters from Lebanon's Shiite group Hezbollah, captured Qusair, a strategic town in the central province of Homs, the linchpin linking Damascus with the regime strongholds on the Mediterranean coast. Following the capture of Qusair, Syrian state-run media and the Hezbollah-owned Al-Manar TV have said the regime is preparing an offensive reportedly named Operation Northern Storm to recapture Aleppo.","Mohammad Qataa was shot in the face and neck by Al Qaeda-linked gunmen .

"A Navy diver died at the bottom of a Maryland pond last year after refusing to leave his trapped fellow sailor to drown alone. Petty Officer 2nd Class Ryan Harris, 23, and Petty Officer 1st Class James Reyher, 28, were sent to dive in the Aberdeen Proving Ground on February 26 2013, but their lifeless bodies were pulled to the surface just 31 minutes after they started the dive. No one knew what had befallen the pair until an investigation, completed last year but only recently released, pieced together the final 31 minutes of the young men's lives. Hero: An investigation found that Navy Petty Officer 2nd Class Ryan Harris could have saved his own life, but exhausted his oxygen trying to free his fellow sailor trapped under water . A series of difficulties: The odds were stacked against Petty Officer 1st Class James Reyher on the day he and Harris embarked on a training exercise that would claim both their lives . The investigation, conducted more than 16 months ago, was finally released last week to The Virginian-Pilot under the Freedom of Information Act. It appears the dive, a pre-deployment training exercise, was doomed from the beginning. It was not a single act, but a series of failures that contributed to the training accident. According to the Pilot, the men were supposed to locate a sunken helicopter 150 feet underwater using a breathing apparatus called a Mark 16, but some of the equipment wasn't working. A barge that would have supplied limitless surface air and audio communication while to the men while submerged was blocked by a barrier set up for another training exercise. Experienced divers: Ryan Harris (left) and James Reyher (right) were among their unit's most capable divers . Young family: Ryan Harris and his wife Deanna had two daughters aged three and one . Broken family: Deanna and Ryan Harris were high school sweethearts . The leaders of the expedition were reluctant to call their commanding officer to seek permission to change the day's training plan, so they decided to have Harris and Reyher use scuba gear and estimated that a single canister of air would be enough for the two to complete the task. The investigation, which called the leaders' actions 'multiple points of failure and decision making' found that the limited air did not allow for the divers to deal with any unforeseen difficulties. Harris and Reher were among their unit's most experienced divers, but the men faced a series of difficulties with their equipment, communication with the surface was patchy and finally, Debris beneath the murky water trapped Reyher 150 feet underwater. Harris and Reyher were connected to each other and the boat. Harris could have cut the cord connecting him to Reyher and swim free, but he didn't. Training day: The two men died during a training day at Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland . 'Harris exhausted himself in an attempt to save Reyher,' the investigator concluded. 'Both divers resisted the natural instincts of self-preservation, in order to expel his last breaths in an effort to save each other.' Harris will posthumously receive the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for his actions. The award is typically given to members of the Navy and Marine Corps who demonstate heroism during non-combat situations. Harris was married to his high school sweetheart, Deanna Favoroso Harris, and the pair had two young daughters. Reyher was also married, to Diana Kafury Reyher, whom he 'loved to spoil and aggravate,' according to his obituary. The deaths resulted in at least five members of personnel being disciplined. Four were charged with dereliction of duty, and the commanding officer who was unreachable was fired for being 'unapproachable and disengaged.'","Petty Officer 2nd Class Ryan Harris, 23, died along with Petty Officer 2nd Class James Reyher, 28, last February .

"Texas gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis refused to apologize on Monday for a controversial ad her campaign released last week that targets her wheelchair-bound, Republican opponent Greg Abbott. The Davis ad uses an empty wheelchair to criticize Abbott, the Lone Star state's partially paralyzed attorney general, for his handling of other victims' legal claims as a government official. The spot has been widely cast as the most negative political ad of the election cycle, and Davis has been skewered by conservatives for preying on Abbott's disability. David stood by the ad today at a news conference, telling reporters 'this ad is about one thing and one thing only: It is about Greg Abbott's hypocrisy.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . At a press conference on Monday to address criticism of an ad attacking her wheelchair-bound opponent, Wendy Davis was flanked by disabled supporters, some of whom were in wheelchairs . Texas Republican Attorney General Greg Abbott's wheelchair is the centerpiece of an attack ad from his opponent for the governor's mansion, Democratic legislator Wendy Davis . Davis, a rising star in the Democratic Party, shot to fame with a 13-hour filibuster last year to protest legislation that restricted abortions . Republican Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott has been a wheelchair-bound paraplegic since a tree fell on him during a run three decades ago . Flanked at the press conference by disabled supporters in wheelchairs, Davis said Abbott 'deserved justice for the terrible tragedy he endured.' 'But then he turned around and built his career working to deny the very same justice he received to his fellow Texans rightly seeking it for themselves,' she charged. The two pols are locked in a bitter struggle to succeed Gov. Rick Perry. Abbott, 56, has been a paraplegic since age 26 when he was paralyzed by a falling tree during a run. The Davis ad uses an empty wheelchair to symbolize her disapproval of his policies. 'A tree fell on Greg Abbott. He sued and got millions,' the ad's narrator says. 'Since then, he's spent his career working against other victims.' 'Abbott argued a woman whose leg was amputated was not disabled because she had an artificial limb,' the ad alleges. 'He ruled against a rape victim who sued a corporation for failing to do a background check on a sexual predator. He sided with a hospital that failed to stop a dangerous surgeon who paralyzed patients.' Abbott's campaign fired at Davis, a state senator, with both barrels after the ad went viral for all the wrong reasons. 'It is challenging to find language strong enough to condemn Sen. Davis' disgusting television ad, which represents a historic low for someone seeking to represent Texans,' the campaign's deputy communications director, Amelia Chasse, said in a statement. 'Sen. Davis' ad shows a disturbing lack of judgment from a desperate politician,' she said, 'and completely disqualifies her from seeking higher office in Texas.' In an interview on Fox News on Monday evening Abbott said it is Davis' 'prerogative' to 'attack a guy in a wheelchair.' 'As for me, I’m running a different type of campaign. I am running a campaign that’s focused on solving the problems of Texans,' he told Fox host Sean Hannity. Abbott said the 'irony' of Davis' ad is that 'all of those things' she claimed 'are equally false because there’s no one who has a stronger track record for protecting victims of rape as I do. 'I created an entire new unit at the Office of the Attorney General where I have arrested more than 4,500 sex offenders and put them behind bars,' he said, according to Politico. The three most recent published polls show Abbott leading the race by an average of 11.3 percentage points, according to Real Clear Politics. Davis stepped away from a backbench in the Texas legislature in 2013 when she spent 13 hours filibustering a law written to limit the number of clinics in the state that could perform abortions. After she successfully ran out the clock on the legislative session, Gov. Perry called lawmakers back for a special session to pass the bill anyway. The pink sneakers she wore during the marathon as supporters flooded the capitol rotunda became a rallying cry for the state's liberal minority, and she was quickly urged to run for governor. A right-wing pundit labeled her 'Abortion Barbie' weeks later. That epithet has stuck. It appeared on 20 posters that showed up in Hollywood, California, in May when Davis traveled there to raise money. A Republican donor paid for the posters, designed by street artist Sabo – the same anonymous man who created posters mocking Barack Obama and actress Gwyneth Paltrow this week when the president spoke a a fundraiser she hosted at her expansive Los Angeles home. Lightning rod: Davis' May 2014 fundraising trip to California brought political jabs out of the woodwork, including this mocking poster . A star is born: Abortion rights activists packed the state capitol to congratulate Davis after her 13-hour filibuster . The wheelchair ad has attracted slings and arrows from both the right and left. Republican National Committee spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski called it 'ridiculous.' Fox News Channel co-host Bob Beckel, a liberal voice who managed the 1984 presidential campaign of Walter Mondale, offered some of the harshest words. 'This isn't a Hail Mary,' he said during a broadcast of 'The Five.' 'This is a Hail Mary to lose. This is like running the other way with the ball.' 'This is the kind of thing that you never, ever do, is take advantage of some of your opponents physical or mental ... conditions,' Beckel said. 'It's almost certain to backfire in every direction you could possibly imagine.'","State Sen.

"This is the heartbreaking moment a female macaque monkey cradled her dead baby in her arms. The grief-stricken mother spent days carrying around the tiny newborn at Tangkoko Nature Reserve and National Park in Sulawesi, Indonesia. She could be seen tenderly cradling her baby - before fending off a male macaque who tried to reach out and touch it. Heartbreaking: A female macaque cradles her dead newborn baby in her arms at an Indonesian national park . The poignant moment was caught on camera by wildlife photographer Andrew Walmsley, 31, who described it as 'very hard to watch'. Both mother and newborn are crested black macaques, which are classified as Critically Endangered due to hunting and habitat loss. Footage shows the female macaque spending days looking after her baby, who passed away just a few weeks after its birth. She can be seen pressing her child tightly against her chest, before grooming, sniffing and gazing mournfully at it.

She even fended off a male macaque who tried to reach out and touch the baby (pictured) Tragic: The poignant moment was caught on camera by wildlife photographer Andrew Walmsley, from Oxford . She even pushes away another male macaque who tries to reach out and touch the baby, while baring her sharp teeth at him. Mr Walmsley, from Oxford, said he and a team of researchers had first spotted the grief-stricken mother clutching the baby to her chest at around 11am. 'I . first saw the mother walking past me and noticed that she was clutching . something to her chest, but that the legs were dragging against the . ground, not gripping her belly,' he said. 'She sat alone, cradling her baby, looking down . at it and not moving for maybe 15 minutes. Endangered: Both mother and newborn are crested black macaques, classified as Critically Endangered . 'Occasionally she would . actually hug him, groom him slowly then return to cradling him between . her legs. 'A short while later, a young male approached and . tried to touch her baby. But the mother bared her teeth and grabbed his . wrist, thrusting it away time and time again.' He added: 'It was very hard to watch really. We were . with her for about an hour, just sitting there watching her. It is a . mother whose child has died, it’s almost irrelevant what species it is. 'You realise there’s so little difference between us and them when you . see that kind of behaviour.' After Mr Walmsley left the national park, the macaque continued to carry her dead newborn for two days, before finally letting go of it. Tangkoko Nature Reserve and National Park is the main stronghold for the remaining population of crested black macaques. The main threat to the species is from humans hunting them for bush meat, which is considered a delicacy in Indonesia for special events such as Christmas and Easter.","Female macaque was spotted cradling her dead newborn baby in arms .

"Texting with Google Glass is just as distracting and dangerous for drivers as using a smartphone. Research has discovered that using the tech giant’s hands-free headset makes motorist delay slamming on their brakes to avoid a collision. And this delay is similar to that caused when drivers use more traditional mobile devices. A study carried out by the University of Central Florida asked 40 people in their 20s to drive in a car simulator. The participants were wearing using Google Glass (pictured), or using smartphones. Their reactions were recorded when a ‘vehicle’ ahead stalled . However, the Glass wearers were able to recover control of their cars faster and more effectively afterwards. The study, carried out by the University of Central Florida, asked 40 people in their 20s to drive in a car simulator either using Glass or smartphones. Their reactions were recorded when a ‘vehicle’ ahead stalled. If you are sending a text, watching the TV or listening to the radio, you may want to stop and give this your full attention. Multi-tasking shrinks the brain, research suggests. A study by the University of Sussex found that men and women who frequently used several types of technology at the same time had less grey matter in a key part of the brain. The finding follows research which has linked multi-tasking with a shortened attention span, depression, anxiety and lower grades at school. The researchers compared text-messaging participants’ reactions on each device to times when they were just driving without multitasking. Psychologist Ben Sawyer, of the University of Central Florida, said: ‘Texting with either a smartphone or Glass will cause distraction and should be avoided while driving. ‘Glass did help drivers in our study recover more quickly than those texting on a smartphone. We hope Glass points the way to technology that can help deliver information with minimal risk.’ The research is the first scientific study to look at using Google Glass to text while driving. Distracted motorists are a renowned menace, with research in the US showing mobile phone use leads to at least 1.6 million crashes a year. With the emergence of Glass and competitors, several states are considering banning drivers from wearing those technologies. Mr Sawyer added: ‘As distractive influences threaten to become more common and numerous in drivers’ lives, we find the limited benefits provided by Glass a hopeful sign of technological solutions to come. Both activities caused motorists to delay slamming on their brakes, suggesting that the hands-free device was as distracting as texting. But Glass wearers returned to driving normally more quickly than those who were using the phone at the wheel (stock image pictured) Google Glass gives drivers the option of using head movements and voice commands to view and respond to text messages, avoiding clumsy thumbs, texting with the technology still causes distraction. But, the researchers state it should not be used as a replacement for phones . ‘While Glass using drivers demonstrated some areas of improved performance in recovering from the brake event, the device did not improve their response to the event itself. ‘More importantly, for every measure we recorded, messaging with either device negatively impacted driving performance. ‘Compared to those just driving, multitaskers reacted more slowly, preserved less headway during the brake event, and subsequently adopted greater following distances.’ While Glass gives drivers the option of using head movements and voice commands to view and respond to text messages, avoiding clumsy thumbs, texting with the technology still causes distraction. He said the bottom line was not to trade a smartphone in for Google Glass in the belief it will make texting safer behind the wheel because it will not, at least for now.","The study was carried out by the University of Central Florida .

"Some people won't touch food or drink that's just a day or two past its best-before date. But when some divers found a 72-year-old bottle of coffee beans in a ship wreck, they couldn't resist brewing up with them – and they were amazed that they made a hot beverage with one hull of a taste. The beans were brought up from the wreck of the Sulina, a Romanian cargo ship which was sunk in Black Sea after being struck by a Soviet torpedo during the Second World War. Water discovery: Divers found a bottle of coffee beans in the wreck of the Sulina, a Romanian cargo ship which was sunk in Black Sea after being struck by a Soviet torpedo during the Second World War . Examination: A diver holding the bottle of coffee beans that had been brought to the surface from the wreck . Despite the ship's violent end, the bottle of beans was salvaged with the stopper still in place. Not content with making the extraordinary find, the divers who explored the 545-foot-long vessel decided to open the bottle and brew up the cup of coffee the world had waited 72 years to experience. Photographer and diver Andrey Nekrasov, 42, said: 'We brought up a dark green bottle, which had been floating near the ceiling of the mess cabin. 'We could hear something moving around inside the bottle, like beads. When we opened it up, we could smell the bitter aroma of coffee. Brewing up: Coffee beans from the wreck being poured into a coffee grinder (left) and being distributed, ready to be put to the test (right) Taste test: Two divers slurp some of the coffee, which they described as being 'remarkably fresh', 'very rich' but with a taste that was 'overcooked' 'We ground the beans and made coffee with them. The coffee was remarkably fresh, despite its age. The taste wasn't perfect but it was one of the most memorable coffee breaks of my life. 'The coffee smelled very rich. The fact it had been underwater in a sealed jar meant it came with an amazing backstory, so the taste was unique and very special. I would describe the taste as overcooked, as if it had been left to stew for a long time.' The Sulina is so perfectly preserved due to its depth. It lies at 72 feet below the surface - the height of four double-decker buses - protecting it from the impact of waves. Other ships from the same period which were scuppered at a depth of 40 to 50 feet have been broken apart in winter storms. Divers also found lightbulbs from the forsaken vessel which they managed to hook up to an electricity supply and bring back to life. A diver examines a bench on the deck of the sunken ship . A diver peers through a porthole in the ship's cabin . Mr Nekrasov said: 'Many of the products found in the ship serve as excellent advertisements for the companies which produced them because they are still in good shape today. 'We brought some of the lightbulbs up from the wreck, cleaned them of salt and connected them to a light fitting. They still light up, despite having been under a pressure two or three times that of the atmosphere for more than seven decades.' Although the Sulina was primarily a cargo ship there were 16 first-class cabins on board and it had a well-stocked wine cellar. Toilets in the wreck: According to the divers the flush and other faucets still worked . A sink on the floor of the wreck, which still had taps that turned easily, according to the divers . Mr Nekrasov said: 'When we discovered the wine cellar we rubbed our hands in anticipation. 'My co-divers dug in the silt for days, only to be rewarded by several broken or empty bottles which smashed when it sank. The bottles we did manage to salvage had not aged well and now contained a strong grape vinegar.' The Sulina, which was built in 1939 in Palermo, Italy, sank on May 29 1942 after joining the Romanian naval fleet at the start of World War Two. The cargo ship was part of a convoy of Romanian and German ships travelling from Constantsa, Romania to Nikolayev, Ukraine. The Sulina was carrying coal and ammunition. A diver examines the crest on the ships bow, which rests 72 feet beneath the surface near the port of Odessa . The ship was hit at 9.30pm by a torpedo fired by a Soviet submarine. The captain, Victor Mikhu, had previously been alerted to foam trails in the water thought to be from a submarine periscope. The Sulina tried evasive manoeuvres but the ship was struck below the waterline on the starboard side. Water flooded into the engine room so quickly that three mechanics on watch drowned before they could leave their posts. In total 31 Romanians and 56 Germans were rescued from the vessel before it finally sank seven miles from the port of Odessa.","Divers found coffee in the wreck of the Romanian ship Sulina, sunk during World War Two by a Soviet submarine .

"A soldier was allegedly kidnapped and sexually assaulted by four women for nearly a week before being stoned and dumped in a mountain range. The 25-year-old victim's ordeal started when he took up the offer of a lift to the city of Mutare in Zimbabwe. Two women and a man were in the car, a Mercedes Benz, and, after driving for about an hour towards the city, the driver diverted from the route. Ordeal: A 25-year-old soldier was abducted by four women and sexually assaulted for four days before being dumped and stoned in a mountain range behind the Zimbabwean city of Mutare (pictured) When the victim complained, he was threatened with a knife. Manicaland police spokesman, Assistant Inspector Nuzondiwa Clean, told Zimbabwean paper NewsDay: 'After diverting from the route, the complainant asked where they were heading to and they told him they were going to get some food. 'The soldier requested to be dropped, but the driver produced a knife and threatened him with it. One of the female passengers blindfolded the complainant with a black cloth.' According to Mr Clean, they then took the complainant to an unknown house where they undressed him and took away his phone and $35. Horror: The Zimbabwean solider (not pictured here) reported his ordeal and police have launched a hunt for the suspects . The suspects ordered the man to be intimate with one of the women on several occasions and he was held between April 19-23. He was then blindfolded again and dropped in the Dangamvura Mountains when, according to police, he was stoned on his left foot, causing a serious injury. The suspect then drove off. The soldier made a report at Sakubva Police Station, prompting investigations, and the suspects are now being hunted.","Man, 25, wanted a lift to city of Mutare, Zimbabwe .

"Manchester United have added Tottenham's Kyle Walker to their list of potential defensive targets for the summer.

"Lucky her! The Queen has received hundreds of gifts in her Diamond Jubilee year - from jewellery to a Corgi dog bed in the shape of a crown . She is, surely, the woman who has everything. So just what should one  have given the Queen for her  Diamond Jubilee? The answer, it turns out, is  anything from 60 pieces of onyx  and ancient Yemeni silver jewellery to a dog bed for her corgis in the shape of a crown. There was also a 1950s Tiffany compact from US president Barack Obama and his wife Michelle, two park benches courtesy of the Royal Engineers Association – and a baby llama, which is now happily residing in a zoo somewhere. The details were included in a list, obtained by the Daily Mail, of gifts presented to members of the royal family last year. While some given to the Queen were distinctly weird and wonderful, two presented to Prince Andrew  are likely to raise eyebrows for the wrong reasons – a valuable ornamental sword and a box of caviar, courtesy of  the billionaire despot who rules Azerbaijan. The prince formed close links with president Ilham Aliyev through his role as a trade envoy. The disclosure will add to growing disquiet over the prince’s relationships with leaders of dubious regimes. While Andrew resigned from his post as a trade ambassador in 2011, he attended several previously arranged engagements last year – and received some generous gifts as a result. Prince Faisel Bin Abdullah bin Mohammed of the Saudi royal family gave him a painting, while the president of Mongolia gave him an ornamental gold string instrument. Giving and receiving gifts is considered to be an important part of the royal family’s work in developing good relations with other countries. Courtiers are supposed to discourage the offering of presents of high monetary value – although this often doesn’t work in reality. Last year, as befitting her Diamond Jubilee celebration, the Queen received several lavish pieces of jewellery and valuable trinkets. But many of the hundreds of gifts she received came unsolicited from members of the public, including a wickerwork throne and a model of the state coach made from an ostrich egg. Not your usual birthday presents: Elizabeth II was given a box of Olympic medals by President of IOC Jacques Rogge and a baby llama by a member of the public . In all, according to Buckingham . Palace, members of the public gave her 436 books, 235 CDs and DVDs, 81 . pieces of embroidery or knitting, 78 self-portraits, 40 digital . photograph books, 28 wall hangings, 19 tea towels and nine jigsaws. The Duke of Edinburgh didn’t miss out, . either. He received – rather oddly – a set of Swarovski binoculars for . his 91st birthday, among other gifts. The lists released yesterday do not . include those of Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall or the Duke and . Duchess of Cambridge, who compile theirs separately. From the President of Mongolia there was an ornamental gold string instrument and from the President of Kuwait three boxes, once again descriptions of which are not included. Feather headdress and a gold sword: The Countess of Wessex, left, and Duke of Edinburgh were also lavished with gifts - but royals are now strictly barred from selling or exchanging presents . Helpfully, given his love of the game, . he was also gifted a golf pitch repairer from an admiring member of the . public and a luxury Aspinal iPad case  worth around £250. The . Queen receives dozens in the course of her official duties but most are . of historical value or small, well-meaning gifts from members of the . public. Last year, as . befitting her Diamond Jubilee celebration, she received several lavish . pieces of jewellery and valuable trinkets including two silver café au . lait pots from Mappin and Webb, a Jaeger-LeCoultre wrist watch and a . boxed set of gold, silver and bronze Olympic medals – as well as her own . laminated Olympic park security pass. Many . of the hundreds she received, however, came unsolicited from members of . the public including her own wickerwork throne, a model of the state . coach made from an ostrich eggs, and a knitted tea cosy featuring . herself and the corgis. In all, according to Buckingham Palace, members of the public gave her: 436 books, 235 CDs and DVDs, 81 pieces of embroidery or knitting, 78 self-portraits, 40 digital photograph books, 28 wall hangings or bunting, 19 tea towels and nine jigsaws. Other gifts included honorary ownership of a baby llama and the adoption of a baby Asian elephant. The Duke of Edinburgh, bizarrely, got a set of Swarovski binoculars for his 91st birthday, while Princess Anne received, among hundreds of relatively small gifts, a set of spurs and a horse blanker. The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester picked up an I Play The Songs CD by Dick Clark on a trip to San Francisco and complimentary membership of  Godalming Leisure Centre in Surrey. The Countess of Wessex, who the Mail revealed was controversially given two lavish sets of jewels by the despotic Bahraini royal family in 2011, was once again on the receiving end of some fabulous pieces. The Amir of Kuwait gave her a necklace, earrings and a ring last November while her husband, Prince Edward, was given a designer watch. Officially, the jewels are not considered to be her personal property, even if she wears them regularly. If they were, she would have to pay tax on them. On her death they must, ostensibly at least, be passed on to the monarch, who will then decide whether they should be handed over to the Royal Collection or lent to her successors. Regulations regarding the classification of royal gifts were brought in after it emerged that Prince Charles had personally pocketed £23,000 from secretly selling on a number of the gifts he received from wealthy benefactors through his trusted valet Michael Fawcett, dubbed Fawcett the Fence. It also emerged that he regularly handed over less valuable items to members of his household, who also went on to profit from them. Since then, members of the Royal Family have been barred from selling or exchanging gifts. Each one received must be logged and either used by the receiver, displayed in one of the Royal palaces or stored in one of their warehouses and should be traceable at all times.

"Confessed: Eldon G. Samuel III said that his father abused him and shoved him twice while holding a gun on the night before Eldon shot him four times . A 14-year-old Idaho boy accused of murdering his father and brother cited the stress of having a disabled child in the household when asked to explain his actions. Eldon Gale Samuel III's 13-year-old brother, Jonathan Samuel, had autism, which Eldon told authorities caused his father, 46-year-old Eldon Samuel Jr., to develop an addiction to painkillers, and for his mother to leave the family. 'Eldon, when asked why he did what he did, said ""If [his brother] wasn’t there … . we’d be a happy family,’” Magistrate Judge Barry Watson told reporters on Friday. Previously, Eldon told investigators that he thought it was cool how the character in the violent video game Grand Theft Auto relieves his stress by shooting people. He has been charged as an adult in the March 24 murders. Eldon described 'hating Jonathan for about five years,' the Spokesman-Review reports. He told authorities that he loved his father, but that he acted crazy when he was under the influence of drugs. 'He just beat me. I loved him, but the next time he came after me …,' Samuel told police officers in a report quoted by Watson. 'That’s self-defense, right?' Samuel initially was charged with first-degree murder in both deaths. However, . Watson said he was changing the charge to second-degree murder in the . father's death after the younger Samuel said his father abused him. The judge says there's a stronger case for premeditation in the brother's death. He . allegedly shot his father four times with a pistol before using a . shotgun to shoot his younger brother once before attacking him with a . knife and machete. Eldon . said that his father had been taking unspecified medication and talking . about zombies the night of the murder, and that he he went outside and . fired a .45 caliber pistol into the air. When . the boys' father went back in the house, he got into an argument with . Eldon and the boy said that his dad shoved him twice in the chest. At that point, Eldon says he took the gun and shot his father in the stomach. His father did not die immediately following that shot, and was reportedly crawling to his other son's room. Scene: The two boys and their father lived in this temporary house (pictured at an earlier date) and that is where the 13-year-old and 46-year-old were found dead on Monday . Eldom . told police that he feared his father was 'coming after him,' which is . what prompted him to fire three additional rounds, two in the cheek and a . final time in his temple. He then reportedly switched firearms and got a shotgun to shoot his brother who was hiding under his bed. Eldon then stabbed his brother Jonathan with both a machete and knife. 'Eldon physically demonstrated the manner in which he held and used the machete,' the investigators wrote in their report. 'The demonstration showed a violent and ‘severe’ action used on his brother.' Eldon's . father's drug use has been well documented, and it appears that his . eldest son was often the one who had to take care of him when he would . take too much. In August, . police were called to the Kooteni Hospital, where Eldon's father was . unconscious, after hospital staff became worried about Eldon and his . brother. Police noted at the time that Eldon was calm and didn't seem . shocked that his father was unconscious and in the hospital. Police also noticed that Eldon seemed to be used to taking care of his little brother - but was frustrated. Just . four days later, police were summoned to the Samuels' home, where the . boys' father was found slumped over, inebriated and incoherent in the . front yard. Eldon had called police because he was worried his father . would try to drive. His brother was found hiding under the bed. The . night of the murders, neighbors reported hearing a single gunshot about . 7:30 p.m., which seems to corroborate Eldon's story about his father . firing the gun outside of the home. After punching and pushing him, Eldon says his father dropped his .45-caliber pistol, but that he often carried another gun. 'I felt scared, like he was going to kill me. I didn’t know if he had the 9 mm on him,' Samuel told the officers. That's when Eldon picked up the gun and shot his father in the chest. The boy's trial is scheduled to resume this week.","Eldon Samuel III, 14, arrested and charged with murdering his father, 46, and brother, 13 .

"A Briton has been killed fighting in Syria, according to reports. The man was named in reports as Abu Daigham al Baritani or Abu Daigham al-Britani - the suffix which has been adopted by those who have travelled from the UK to fight in the country. He is said to have been part of the Rayat al-Tawheed, a collection of British combatants linked to the rebel group Islamic State of Iraq and al Sham, or ISIS. Abu Daighum al Britani, pictured left with Abu Abdurrahman al Britani , was from London and became a member of Rayat al Tawheed, an ISIS faction that communicates in English . A statement apparently issued on the Rayat al-Tawheed Instagram account said the man was killed 'in a battle a few nights ago'. It added: 'May Allah accept him.' Shiraz Maher, senior fellow at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation (ICSR) at King's College London, said on Twitter that the man, who was reportedly from London, has 'featured regularly in Rayat Tawheed vids'. The Foreign Office was unable to confirm the death. British fighters in Syria have been posting disturbing images of themselves on social media . A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said: 'The UK has no representation in Syria, and we are not able to provide consular services. While we look into reports we receive of British nationals being killed or injured in Syria, these are often very hard to verify because we have no in-country presence.' Around 400 Britons are believed to have gone to Syria over the last two years to fight, with an estimated 20 having died. Last month 18-year-old Abdullah Deghayes, from Brighton, whose uncle is a former Guantanamo detainee, died in the war-torn country.","Man killed in Syria is named as Abu Daigham al Baritani from London .

"California has an estimated 15.4 billion barrels of crude oil beneath its fertile farmland - and now companies are scrambling to get their hands on it, putting the lush landscape in danger. While the 'Monterey Shale' has long been believed to be under 1,750 square miles of central and southern California, technology is finally able to extract it, potentially sparking a huge oil boom. But the oil could also prove a . massive area of conflict between the oil companies and the state's . powerful environmental interests, as campaigners protest against the use . of fracking to extract it. There . are also fears that the fertile landscape will be taken over by looming . drills and oil sites, pushing out vineyards, endangering rare species and flattening the rolling hills. Reserve: The Monterey Shale is believed to be under 1,750 sq miles of central and southern California . But amid the concerns, companies are staking their . claim on the shale, quietly buying up mineral rights and . carrying out tests across the state - all behind a veil of secrecy. If . companies can extract it, it will turn the state from the third biggest . producer of oil to the first - as the Monterey Shale has four times as . much oil as Texas, currently the biggest producer. Companies have be unable to reach the oil before now because tectonic activity folded the rock and pushed oil into layered pockets that are expensive to reach. The oil is also 6,000 to 15,000 feet beneath the surface, while in other areas, like Midway-Sunset in California, companies need only drill up to 2,000 feet. Fertile: The vineyards of Hames Valley near Bradley, . where a battle for mineral rights is underway. The area is home to . several endangered species - but also one of the largest deposits of . shale oil in the country . Bleak future: Companies are buying up mineral rights to public land and carrying out test drills . In December, Exxon Mobil Corp. predicted that the U.S. will become an oil exporter by 2025, due to an . increase in production and energy efficiencies. Texas is the top producer of crude oil and its on the increase; in . September, the state's crude-oil production reached two million barrels per day, while production in 2011 was 1.5 million barrels per day. North Dakota produced 728,000 barrels of oil a day in September, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. California takes the third place for production, with 524,000 barrels of oil a day in September. Despite this central role in oil production, it has some of the highest gas prices in the nation. Alaska is the fourth largest producer, with 502,000 barrels a day in September, and Oklahoma produced 250,000 barrels, putting it in fifth place, according to the EIA. Source: Market Watch . But technological advances have now made extracting the Monterey Shale more likely, the New York Times reported, and old and new companies are swooping in to stake a claim. Mineral rights to public lands are being sold by the Bureau of Land Management and plots have soared from $2 an acre to more than a thousand dollars each. The successful bidders have 10 years to develop a working oil well on the land or the lease expires, NBC News explained. The government receives 12.5 per cent of revenues from the oil. 'It's good for us,' Gabe Garcia, an assistant field officer for the Bureau of Land Management, told NBC. 'Last year we brought in $190 million.' Companies have begun drilling holes northwest of Bakersfield to see if they hit the jackpot, keeping quiet about what, when and how they're exploring - as well as what they find. 'Our companies are not forthcoming on . their business plans,' said Tupper Hull from the Western States Petroleum Association, which represents companies including Occidental and Venoco. 'These are pretty smart people, they're pretty good at what they do. They're pretty competitive out there.' And while little has been revealed about the success of the searches, still they continue. Destruction: A gas flare burns at a fracking site in rural Bradford County, Pennsylvania . 'There are billions of barrels of oil . buried in the Monterey Shale, and as far as I know, nobody's been able . to find it yet,' Neil Ormond, the president of Petroleum Land . Management, told the Times. 'But I think there's going to be more . people looking for it. You can't let a few dry holes discourage the . whole thing, because if you find oil, you make money.' But as well as exciting oilmen, the Monterey Shale has also sprung environmentalists into action. To extract the oil, companies would use hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, which is the drilling technique used in booms elsewhere - but campaigners deem unsafe for the environment. The geological formation means the . fracking will also have to be more intensive in the area, which is . dangerous because of the various tectonic plates beneath California, . environmentalists say. Anger: Protestors hold signs against fracking - the method by which the oil is extracted - during a demo outside of the California Environmental Protection Agency Headquarters in Sacramento last year . While there is currently no legislation against fracking in California, the State Department of Conservation released a draft of fracking rules, starting the process to set regulations. But not every large company is getting involved with the process; Chevron has drilled into the area but has 'not been encouraged by the results', it told NBC in a statement. Others aren't giving up just yet. 'I don't really know what the break point . is for the companies,' Tupper Hull, from the petroleum association, . added. 'That's what our members are trying to figure out right now.'","Oil is under 1,750 square miles of central and southern California .

"The Daily Mail reported that  Princess Beatrice will not be boarding the Virgin Galactic spacecraft . At least 24 of the wealthy investors who signed up to be among the first space tourists with Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic programme have given up their tickets. The 800 passengers have stuck with Branson's venture for 10 years despite numerous set-backs and hiccups. But the crash of SpaceShipTwo in California's Mojave desert last Friday that killed one pilot and left another in hospital finally prompted three per cent of the 'future astronauts' to pull out. Peter Ulrich von May, an asset manager based in Switzerland, told The Independent he no longer wishes to travel into space with Virgin Galactic and he has demanded his money back. He said: 'I want out. I subscribed seven years ago at 63, am still an active private pilot and in good health but who knows how long it will now take. I have already informed VG of my wish - no reply yet.' The Daily Mail reported two days ago that one of the program's highest-profile customers, Princess Beatrice, will not be boarding the Virgin Galactic spacecraft after the disaster last week. 'Beatrice was excited by the idea of space tourism, but there is no way she will be going on one of the flights, if they are ever allowed to take place,' a source close to Buckingham Palace revealed. Tonight, the Telegraph understood 24 have officially filed for a refund. Galactic Chief Executive George Whitesides told the Telegraph the news was ‘unsurprising’ but his resolve remains 'unshaken'. He told the paper: 'A few people have asked for a refund. I don’t think that’s surprising and I think what is relevant is that the vast majority have said ""don’t give up, keep going, we’re with you"".' An anonymous source told The Independent that a group of more than 30 people had been talking about asking for a refund, a move that could cost Branson millions. 'Before this tragic event happened I had been thinking of pulling my money anyhow because there had been various reports saying it doesn't stand a chance of getting into space,' the source added. 'I am giving serious thought to pulling out.' More than 700 people - including Hollywood A-listers Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt, Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio - have bought tickets for Virgin Galactic space voyage flights, which sell for $250,000. Ashton Kutcher was one of the first celebrities to book his ticket - and the 500th person overall - and he has since been joined by Katy Perry,  Justin Bieber, Russell Brand and Lady Gaga. Actress Victoria Principal bought a ticket in 2009, but her representative Alan Nierob told USA Today that she withdrew from the program in 2012. Scroll down for video . The crash of SpaceShipTwo in California's Mojave desert on Friday, which killed one pilot and injured another, has reportedly caused many of the millionaire clients of Virgin Galactice to rethink a flight into space . Virgin chief Sir Richard Branson insists Virgin Galactic can 'move forward' and has vowed to travel on a space flight with his relatives once safety tests have been completed . On Friday, Branson announced on the Virgin Galactic site that refunds would be available following the tragedy and a spokesperson  said that a number of people have asked for their money back. 'We can confirm that less than three per cent of people have requested refunds,' the spokesman said. But the anonymous source also told The Independent some people are 'die-hard Richard Branson supporters and they will go on it whatever'. Igor Kutsenko, who runs an advertising agency in Moscow and plans to go into space with his parents, said: 'We were all shocked and disappointed by the tragic news. We are in the project from very beginning. More than 700 people - including Hollywood A-listers Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt - have bought tickets for Virgin Galactic space voyage flights, which sell at $250,000 . Tom Hanks (left) and Leonardo DiCaprio (right) also shelled out for tickets on the spacecraft . 'My parents are getting older and I'm only worried that their physical ability to participate in this obviously challenging adventure is deteriorating. But we stay firm in our desire to make this suborbital flight.' Branson had previously said, 'Everybody who signs up knows this is the birth of a new space program and understands the risks that go with that.' Since Friday's crash the billionaire tycoon has insisted Virgin Galactic can move forward' and vowed to travel on board the space flight with his relatives once safety tests have been completed. He told Sky News: 'We've spent many, many years building a spacecraft, a mothership, a space port, that I think can do the job and do the job safely. Actress Victoria Principal bought a ticket in 2009, but her representative Alan Nierob told USA Today she withdrew from the program in 2012 . Ashton Kutcher (left) was one of the first celebrities to book his ticket and he has since been joined by Katy Perry (right) 'We will not start taking people until we've finished a whole massive series of test flights and until myself and my family have gone up, and until we feel that we can safely say to people 'we're ready to go'.' He added: 'All I can say is we will not fly members of the public unless we can fly myself and family members. 'We need to be absolutely certain our spaceship has been thoroughly tested - and that it will be - and once it's thoroughly tested and we can go to space, we will go to space. 'We must push on.

"A newly-released document has revealed that after the top secret mission to kill Osama bin Laden the head of U.S. special forces ordered all photos of his body be either turned in or destroyed. The e-mail was sent by then-Vice Admiral William McRaven two weeks after the secret seek and destroy operation found the Al Qaeda leader. A conservative campaign group which requested its release has claimed the e-mail, which is almost entirely redacted, 'may have been in violation of the law'. Dated May 13, 2011, it said: 'One particular item that I want to emphasize is photos; particularly UBLs remains. At this point -- all photos should have been turned over to the CIA; if you still have them destroy them immediately or get them to the [redacted.]' Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, along with with members of the national security team, receive an update on the mission against Osama bin Laden in the Situation Room of the White House . Osama bin Laden was killed in a special forces raid on his hideout in Abbottabad in Pakistan . CNN reports the e-mail was obtained by Judicial Watch, which has called for the public release of photos of the raid in Pakistan that killed the al Qaeda leader. The e-mail, which was almost entirely redacted, was released under a Freedom of Information Act request. Days before McRaven's instructions, Judicial Watch had filed a request for such photos, and hours before, they filed a lawsuit, according to the group's president, Tom Fitton. 'Despite there being multiple requests for this information, and a lawsuit for this information, there was a directive that was sent out, to who knows who, to destroy records,' he said. 'It may have been in violation of the law,' he said. It is not clear whether any photos of bin Laden's remains were actually destroyed. Through a spokesman, McRaven declined to comment, CNN reported. Retired General James 'Spider' Marks, a CNN military analyst, says if McRaven ordered photos deleted, he may have been trying to protect operational secrets, sources and methods and trying to make sure no commandos kept any photos or video of the covert raid that they were not authorized to keep.

'It wouldn't be surprising if they shook them down, and they said 'OK, I want to make sure you don't have something that's hidden away someplace,' ' he said. In the days after the raid, President Barack Obama said he would not authorize the release of any images of bin Laden's corpse, saying it would create a security risk. 'It is important for us to make sure that very graphic photos of somebody who was shot in the head are not floating around as an incitement to additional violence, as a propaganda tool,' the president told CBS news magazine '60 Minutes.' People gather in Times Square New York shortly after the announcement from the President  Obama announced that Al Qaida mastermind Osama bin Laden was dead and the United States has his body . Former FBI Assistant Director Tom Fuentes said he would have similar concerns if photos of the terrorist's body were made public. 'You would see those images forever on television,' he said. 'That could lead to more recruitment of future al Qaeda members, making him a martyr.' Fitton is not persuaded by that argument. 'Americans' right to know about what their government is up to should be circumscribed because we don't want to offend terrorists and their sympathizers? That to me is unbelievable,' he said. 'This is a historic raid. People have a right to this information.' But so far, the courts have not sided with Judicial Watch on that question, and the Supreme Court declined to hear the organization's appeal.

"Bargain holidays for Westerners looking to get a bit of sunshine and a drink by the pool in the winter could be a thing of the past on Egypt's Red Sea coast. The Muslim Brotherhood, which won success in the first round of parliamentary elections last month, is set on turning Egypt into a 'sin-free' holiday resort. But the end of sun worshippers flying to resorts like Sharm el-Sheikh could spell disaster for an economy that has already been battered by this year's political unrest. On the way out? Tourists lap up the sunshine at Naama Bay, Sharm el-Sheikh. Islamist parties want to stop Westerners drinking alcohol and wearing skimpy beachwear . Tourism magnet: Some 1.4million Brits travel to Egypt every year - the vast majority of them heading for its Red Sea beach resorts . Azza al-Jarf, a candidate for the Muslim Brotherhood, told supporters: 'Tourists don't need to drink alcohol when they come to Egypt; they have plenty at home. 'They came to see the ancient civilisation, not to drink alcohol.' Since its success in the first round of elections on November 28 and 29, the Brotherhood and the even more fundamentalist party of Salafi Muslims called Al-Nour have been under pressure to define their stance on a wide range of issues - including Islamic law, personal freedom and tourism. Al-Nour has said it seeks to impose strict Islamic law in Egypt, while the Muslim Brotherhood says publicly it does not want to force its views on an appropriate Islamic lifestyle on Egyptians. The unrest that saw former president Hosni Mubarak ousted has hit the economy hard and shaken investor confidence. Unrest: The overthrow of former president Hosni Mubarak earlier this year and continued violent clashes has badly hit the Egyptian economy and driven tourists away . On Sunday, interim prime minister Kamal el-Ganzouri broke down in tears as he said the state of the economy was 'worse than anyone imagines'. Turning around the decline in tourism is key to breathing life back into the economy. The industry was also hit by two fatal shark attacks in Sharm el-Sheikh last year. The Muslim Brotherhood came in first and Al-Nour second in the first round of voting. The Salafis, who follow the Wahhabi school of thought that predominates in Saudi Arabia, are clear in their opposition to alcohol and skimpy beachwear. They are also undecided on whether unmarried couples should be allowed to share hotel rooms, or the display of ancient Egyptian statues like fertility gods. Attractions: Two Islamist parties finished top of voting in the first round of parliamentary elections last month and the Egyptian tourism industry could face big changes if they get a majority . But the Muslim Brotherhood has sent more mixed messages, reflecting it is more inclined to leave tourism alone for the sake of the economy. Influential cleric Yasser Bourhami has called for 'halal tourism' - which includes restrictions on Westerners. Speaking to private television network Dream TV, he said: 'A five-star hotel with no alcohol, a beach for women - sisters - separated from men in a bay where the two sides can enjoy a vacation for a week without sins. 'The tourist doesn't have to swim with a bikini and harm our youth.' Tourism accounts for roughly 10 per cent of Egypt's GDP, employs an estimated 3million people and is one of the pillars of its economy. Huge swathes of the country, including the Red Sea coast with its stunning coral reefs and Nile Valley cities like Luxor, with its ancient temples and tombs, are solely dependent on tourism. There are around 15million visitors to Egypt every year and analysts say bookings for its beach resorts - mostly far from the unrest - have recovered faster than areas in the centre of the country where most pharaonic ruins are found. A total of 1.4million Brits visited the country last year - with 70 per cent (around one million) heading to the beach resorts. This year, tourist arrivals fell more than 35 per cent in the second quarter because of the unrest, and Egypt expects to earn around $9billion from tourism in 2011 - down by a third.","1.4m Brits head to Egypt every year on holiday - 70% of them to Red Sea beach resorts .

"Exactly a century after it became the first ship to be sunk by a U-Boat torpedo, the HMS Pathfinder has been marked with a wreath at its underwater resting place. Divers swum 220 feet (68 metres) down off Scotland's east coast to commemorate the anniversary - filming the touching event on a GoPro camera. They made their way through the murky waters off St Abb's Head, before coming across the rusted remains of the once great warship. Scroll down for video . The HMS Pathfinder, which became the first ship to be sunk by a U-Boat torpedo 100 years ago . The unorthodox ceremony was commissioned by the Royal Navy, and was dedicated to the 250 crew members who lost their lives on the boat during World War I. It was initially thought that the HMS Pathfinder had been blown up by a mine - but was later confirmed to be a torpedo from a U-Boat commanded by Otto Hersing. Hersing went on to become one of the Germans' most successful U-Boat commanders, earning himself the nickname 'Zerstörer der Schlachtschiffe' - or 'Destroyer of Battleships'. Captain Chris Smith RN laying a wreath on behalf of the Royal Navy and Royal Marines lost on HMS Pathfinder . The Royal Navy and Royal Marines remember HMS Pathfinder from onboard HMS Example . The Royal Navy P2000 patrol boat HMS Example meeting Wavedancer II . There were just 18 known survivors - including the captain - Lieutenant Commander Francis Martin Leake, who escaped wounded. Lieutenant Edward Oliver Stallybrass (then Sonnenschein) also survived the sinking, and recounted: 'The ship gave a heavy lurch forward and took an angle of about forty degrees down by the bow. 'Water came swirling up to the searchlight platform. 'The Captain said: ""Jump you devils jump!"" 'The Captain and his secretary remained with the ship until the very end but somehow both survived' The Stern family, who laid a plaque over the wreck site to remember William Stern - a stoker on board . William Stern, who died on board (left) and a plaque made to commemorate his death . The ship was struck on the starboard side under the bridge from 1,500 yards (1,372 metres) while patrolling waters off southern Scotland. The forward magazine exploded, the bows were blown off and it sank in around four minutes. Author Aldous Huxley, who wrote the English classic 'Brave New World', actually witnessed the moment the ship was struck. He said in a letter to his father: 'There was not a piece of wood, they said, big enough to float a man - and over acres the sea was covered with fragments - human and otherwise. 'They brought back a sailor's cap with half a man's head inside it.' The wreath was presented to the team of British Sub-Aqua Club divers by Paul Ratcliff - a 74-year-old from Canterbury who lost his uncle in the disaster. A portrait of German Commander Otto Hersing, who sunk the ship from the U-Boat (furthest right) Bill Austin never met his nephew, as he was just 19 when he was killed on board the ship, but Mr Ratcliff was especially keen to honour him, as his body was never recovered and he has no grave. Because of difficulty travelling, his grandparents were unable to make it up to Scotland to remember their son, so when he heard about the commemorative dive he requested that the wreath be placed. A plaque was also laid over the wreckage site by the Stern family, to remember William Stern - a stoker who died on board the Pathfinder. Despite the sinking being plainly visible from the shore, British authorities tried to cover it up, and claimed the ship was destroyed by a mine. However, The Scotsman published the report of a fisherman who helped with the rescue, revealing the truth that the boat was  shot down. The HMS Pathfinder was a 385-foot (117-metre) long Pathfinder-class scout cruiser. It had a top speed of 25 knots and had 15 guns and two torpedo tubes. The Germans ran the U-Boat campaign throughout World War I, and used the submarines to attack the Allies' trade routes. They mostly attacked around  Britain and the Mediterranean, and destroyed almost 5,000 ships in total. The campaign started in the North Sea, when 10 submarines were sent from Heligoland to attack Royal Navy ships. However, it was unsuccessful - only one torpedo was fired and it missed its intended target - HMS Monarch. Meanwhile, two of the U-Boats were lost. The U-Boats had much more success when their attentions were turned to the war on commerce. Britain had already managed to block off Germany with its Navy, not even allowing food to enter the country, and since the Germans' main navy was much weaker than the British, they fought back using U-Boats. Admiral Hugo Von Pohl, commander of the German High Seas Fleet, declared the British and Irish seas a war zone, and the Germans send out 20 boats to form a naval blockade. They sunk a huge amount of trade boats heading into Britain. In 1917, the Germans came up with the tactic of trying to 600,000 tons of shipping heading into Britain each month - they believed this would force their enemies to try for peace within six months. This was a huge success - 860,000 tons were sunk in April of that year alone, the British were left with just six weeks-worth of wheat, and the Americans were forced to declare war. Towards the end of the war, the Allies had become far better at countering the threat of U-Boats. They used planes to patrol the seas - forcing them to go below the surface, where they were blind. The North Sea Mine Barrage then followed - when 70,000 mines were lain and destroyed six U-Boats between September and November 1918. Upon the German surrender, the Allies insisted all U-Boats were also surrendered to them. Their last act was to suppress the German naval mutiny in October 1918 - revolt by sailors of the German High Seas Fleet. In total, U-Boats sunk almost 13 million gross tons of Allies' shipping. Of the 351 boats, 178 were lost in combat, with 5,000 people killed on board them.","Ceremony filmed by British Sub-Aqua Club divers on a GoPro camera .

Showing no emotion throughout the proceedings, Miller waived the right to a lawyer and was handcuffed before being led from the courtroom after his sentencing. The court, comprising a chief judge flanked by two 'people's assessors,' ruled it would not hear any appeals to its decision. Earlier, it had been believed that Miller had sought asylum when he entered North Korea. During the trial, however, the prosecution argued that was a ruse and that Miller also falsely claimed to have secret information about the U.S. military in South Korea on his iPad and iPod. Miller was charged under Article 64 of the North Korean criminal code, which is for espionage and can carry a sentence of five to 10 years, though harsher punishments can be given for more serious cases. Matthew Miller, a U.S. citizen, sits before the Supreme Court during his trial in Pyongyang . The Associated Press was allowed to attend the trial. A trial is expected soon for one of the other Americans being held, Jeffrey Fowle, who entered the North as a tourist but was arrested in May for leaving a Bible at a sailor's club in the city of Chongjin. The third American, Korean-American missionary Kenneth Bae, is serving out a 15-year sentence for alleged 'hostile acts.' All three have appealed to the U.S. government to send a senior statesman to Pyongyang to intervene on their behalf. During a brief interview with The Associated Press in Pyongyang last week, Miller said he had written a letter to President Barack Obama but had not received a reply. Handcuffed Matthew Miller, a U.S. citizen, leaves after his trial at the Supreme Court in North Korea . Handcuffed Matthew Miller, a U.S. citizen, is led to a courtroom for his trial at the Supreme Court in Pyongyang . Fowle, a 56-year-old equipment operator for the city of Moraine, Ohio, said his wife, a hairstylist from Russia, made a written appeal on his behalf to Russian President Vladimir Putin. He said the Russian government responded that it was watching the situation. The U.S. has repeatedly offered to send its envoy for North Korean human rights issues, Robert King, to Pyongyang to seek the freedom of the detainees, but without success. Former President Bill Clinton came in 2009 to free a couple of jailed journalists. Jimmy Carter made the trip in 2010 to secure the release of Aijalon Gomes, who had been sentenced to eight years of hard labor for illegally crossing into the country to do missionary work. In 2011, the State Department's envoy for North Korean human rights managed to successfully intervene in the case of Korean-American businessman Eddie Yong Su Jun.

Matthew Miller, a U.S. citizen, is handcuffed after his trial at the Supreme Court in Pyongyang, North Korea, Sunday, Sept. 14, 2014 . A North Korean flag flies at the Supreme Court where a trial of Matthew Miller, a U.S. citizen, was to be held, in Pyongyang, North Korea, Sunday, Sept. 14, 2014. North Korea's Supreme Court on Sunday sentenced Miller to six years of hard labor for entering the country illegally and trying to commit espionage . The United States has no diplomatic relations with North Korea and strongly warns American citizens against traveling to the country. Uri Tours, a New Jersey-based travel agency specializing in North Korea tourism that handled the arrangements for Miller, said in an email Sunday that it was working to have Miller returned to his parents in the United States. 'Although we ask a series of tailored questions on our application form designed to get to know a traveler and his/her interests, it's not always possible for us to foresee how a tourist may behave during a DPRK tour,' the travel agency said in a statement on Friday, referring to North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 'Unfortunately, there was nothing specific in Mr. Miller's tour application that would have helped us anticipate this unfortunate outcome.' The agency said that as a result of the incident, it now routinely requests a secondary contact and reserves the right to contact those references to confirm facts about a potential tourist. It has also added advice warning tourists not to rip up any officially issued documents and 'to refrain from any type of proselytizing.'

"Locked-up: Leigh Arendse, 25, who was jailed for four years after he raped a 12-year-old girl in Cambridgeshire . A paedophile who hid in a 12-year-old girl's bedroom and had sex with her for two days while her unknowing parents sat downstairs has been jailed. Leigh Arendse, 25, of Brunswick Park, Barnet, groomed the innocent youngster on an internet chat room before going from London to her Cambridgeshire home to meet her. He then spent 48 hours in her bedroom watching DVDs and having sex with her - and hid behind the door when her mum went to check on her. Sick Arendse claimed he thought the girl was actually 14 and only realised her true age when her mum told her off for smoking in her room. He then left the house and went to London with the girl whose parents raised the alarm when she went missing last August. Arendse, of Brunswick Park, Barnet, has now been jailed for four years after admitting two counts of raping the girl. Judge Jonathan Haworth told him: 'This is not a case of an 18 or 19-year-old - you are a mature adult. 'You had been in her bedroom when you knew that members of her family were also in the house. 'There was a sheer irresponsibility on your part when you failed to find out her real age.' Sara Walker, prosecuting, told Cambridge Crown Court: 'The defendant stayed in the victim's room where the two watched DVDs. 'The next evening, her mum came up and he hid behind the door. 'Her mum was appalled at the mess and said that her daughter shouldn't be smoking at the age of 12. The defendant then found out that she was indeed 12.' Sentenced: Leigh Arendse was jailed for four years at Cambridge Crown Court for raping a 12-year-old girl . She added: 'The victim said she started to kiss him and that he initially pushed her off. 'She then tried to kiss him again and he kissed her back before they had sex.' The court heard that the youngster told her family she had unprotected sex with Arendse. Defending, David McIntosh claimed that Arendse's response to finding out the girl's true age was one of 'shock' and he decided to return to London. He said: 'She was the one who insisted on following him to London and in his defence he didn't want her to come with him.' Arendse was also handed a 10-year Sexual Offences Prevention Order which bans him from having unsupervised . contact with children under 16, possessing any device capable of . accessing the internet unless it retains and displays history and . deleting such history. He was also placed on the sex offenders' register . Detective Constable Andy MacDonald, from Cambridgeshire Constabulary, said: 'Arendse was clearly aware that the girl in this case was underage but continued his contact with her and arranged to meet up. 'He had plenty of opportunities to stop the relationship but chose to travel to meet her to have sex. 'This case shows the dangers of using online chat rooms and how easily perpetrators can gain the confidence of young people in order to exploit them.'","Leigh Arendse groomed the innocent youngster on the internet .

"Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama proudly declared 10 million jobs have been created during his tenure - but failed to mention that 4.3 million were lost in his first year. In a speech at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation in Washington, he addressed America's 'unfinished work' including racial divisions, education, healthcare, and international crises. But he also declared 'there is almost no economic measure by which we are not better off since I took office'. Forgotten something? President Obama gushed about the creation of 10 million jobs but neglected to tell the audience at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation in Washington that 4.3 million jobs were lost . He said: 'After the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, our businesses have created 10 million new jobs over the last 54 months. 'This is the longest uninterrupted stretch of job growth in our history.' However, with a loss of 4.3 million jobs in 2009 following the economic crash, the net gain only amounts to 4.9 million jobs created - less than half the amount cited. In 2012, Obama was criticized for failing to declare the 4.3 million job losses when he declared a net gain of 5 million jobs since he took office. Now, with a net gain of 4.9 million jobs created during his presidency, Obama remains far behind President Bill Clinton, who created a record 22 million jobs between 1993 and 2001. Reagan was the second most-successful president in terms of job creation, with a net gain of 16 million between 1981 and 1989. Not so clear: The latest jobs report signalled a decline in the job growth rate as part-time job offers rocket . Analysts attribute the job losses and surge in part-time employment to Obamacare as employers find ways to avoid buying medical insurance for employees . The POTUS and FLOTUS greeted crowds together before Obama gave his 30-minute speech at the event . The latest job report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, published on September 5, reported just 142,000 jobs created, down from an average monthly increase of 288,000 reported in June. But that number includes a net loss of 523,000 full-time jobs and a net gain of 799,000 part-time jobs - the highest increase in part-time employment since 1993. Analysts attribute the rise of casual employees to Obamacare, as companies do not have to buy medical insurance for workers. The Federal Reserve Bank in Philadelphia wrote that its August numbers show 18 per cent of employers cut workers because of the Affordable Care Act, while just 3 per cent hired more. More than 18 per cent said they have more part-time positions because of Obamacare, versus 1.5 per cent who said they had fewer. In New York, The Federal Reserve Bank conducted two surveys in August which revealed 21 per cent of employers in the manufacturing sector said they had eliminated jobs because of Obamacare, as well as 16.9 per cent in service industries. Mention: Obama paid tribute to the outgoing US Attorney General Eric Holder, who he called 'my friend' In a 28-minute speech, Obama also issued an appeal to Americans to vote, as he highlighted the ‘unfinished work’ he has to complete, including gender equality, racial integration, and more widespread education. He addressed the conflict in Ferguson, paying tribute to murdered teenager Michael Brown, whose family attended the event. And he declared it is America’s ‘responsibility’ to ‘lead’ the world in tackling the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, combating Ebola, and breaking up the Islamic State. He said: 'America is leading the effort to rally the world against Russian aggression in Ukraine. 'America is leading the fight to contain and combat Ebola in Africa. 'America is building the coalition that will degrade and ultimately destroy the terror group known as ISIL. 'As Americans we are leading and we don't shy away from these responsibilities.

"Hillary Rodham Clinton is defending the nearly quarter-million dollar fee she charges for speaking engagements at colleges and universities after students at one university demanded that she return the fee she collected for a speech she is slated to give in the fall. Clinton responded to the criticism during an interview this week, saying that the enormous sums of money she's collected for speeches she's given over the last 18 months has gone towards her family's charity, The Clinton Foundation. Clinton's wealth has been under scrutiny since an interview last month . in which she described her family as 'dead broke' and in debt when . husband Bill Clinton left the White House in January 2001. Charity: Clinton says all of the money she receives from speaking engagements goes towards her family's charity, the Clinton Global Initiative . Pricey: Clinton often charges more than $200,000 for speaking engagements . The potential 2016 presidential candidate later . called that description 'inartful.' Last week, students at the University of Nevada Las Vegas threatened to protest Clinton's visit to the university - where she is scheduled to speak at the university's Foundation Dinner in October - if the former secretary of state didn't return the $225,000 fee for her speech. 'All of the fees have been donated to the Clinton Foundation for it to . continue its life-changing and life-saving work. So it goes from a . foundation at a university to another foundation,' Clinton said during an interview with ABC News when . asked about the criticism she and her husband have faced recently for . their wealth. Clinton didn't say whether she planned on returning the money, and defended her fee by saying that her speaking engagements are used to present 'new ideas to help strengthen the economy, which in turn, will help lower income inequality.' Cha-ching! Combined, Bill and Hillary Clinton have a net worth of more than $100 million . 'It’s been my experience,' Clinton said, 'That they’re not worried about . my speaking or my household, they’re worried about their own. And . that’s the kind of debate I think I’m furthering as I go around the . country speaking.' Clinton has spent the past month traveling around the world promoting her recently released memoirs, Hard Choices. During the book tour, Clinton has repeatedly made comments about her family's wealth that have caused critics to say she is out of touch. 'We came out of the White House not only dead broke, but in debt. We had no money when we got there, and we struggled to, you know, piece together the resources for mortgages, for houses, for Chelsea's education. You know, it was not easy. Bill has worked really hard - and it's been amazing to me - he's worked very hard. First of all, we had to pay off all our debts, which was, you know, he had to make double the money because of obviously taxes and then pay off the debts and get us houses and take care of family members,' Clinton said during a June 9, interview with ABC News. Hard Choices: Clinton currently is traveling the world in promotion of her new book, Hard Choices . On June 21, Clinton continue to defend against her critics' in a June 21, interview with the Guardian newspaper. 'They don't see me as part of the problem because we pay ordinary income . tax, unlike a lot of people who are truly well off, not to name names, . and we have done it through dint of hard work. We know how blessed we . are. We were neither of us raised with these kinds of opportunities, and . we worked really hard for them. But all one has to do is look at my . record going back to my time in college and law school to know not only . where my heart is, but where my efforts have been,' she said.

"Two top ranking American bankers working in senior positions in London have committed suicide in the space of two days. Gabriel Magee, a 39-year-old JP Morgan bank executive, died early this morning after he jumped 500ft from the top of the bank's European headquarters. His body was discovered on the ninth floor roof, which surrounds the 33-story Canary Wharf skyscraper. Just two days earlier, on Sunday, fellow American banker, William 'Bill' Broeksmit, 58, was found hanging in his South Kensington home. Broeksmit - who retired last February - was a former senior manager at Deutsche Bank and had lived in London many years. He started working for the bank in 1996 but left for a period of 7 years before returning in 2008. Tragedy: IT executive Gabriel Magee was found dead at the end of January after jumping from the top of JP Morgan's headquarters in Canary Wharf, London, and landing on a surrounding roof . Magee was a vice president in the corporate and investment bank technology department having joined JP Morgan in 2004 and moved with the bank from the U.S. to Britain in 2007. Magee was named in an email sent to all JP Morgan staff Tuesday afternoon. A company spokesman said: 'We are . deeply saddened to have lost a member of the J.P. Morgan family at 25 . Bank Street today. Our thoughts and sympathy are with his family and . his friends'. A source close to Magee said he was in 'good standing with his bosses and colleagues. He was well liked.' Scotland Yard said they were called to 25 Bank Street at 8.02 a.m. and detectives are not treating the death as suspicious. 'No arrests have been made and the incident is being treated as non-suspicious at this early stage', a spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said. Canary Wharf workers were in shock today, with one trader telling MailOnline that his body lay on the flat roof until around midday. 'My colleague yelled that he could see that someone had jumped from the top of the building onto a lower roof. His body lay there uncovered for at least two hours,' he said. In shock: A JP Morgan worker looks out of his window as Mr Magee's body was recovered in January, but it emerged today he had made several attempts to get on the roof before his death . Roof death:  Workers at Canary Wharf said hundreds were looking at the man's body from their windows . Investigation: Police at the scene outside the JP Morgan building this morning, where the man was found dead at around 8am . 'Hundreds were looking out of their windows at him. 'It was bonus week at JP Morgan last week so I hope it wasn't to do with that'. Another Canary Wharf worker who could see where the man fell told the Evening Standard: 'It’s upsetting what’s happened but the thought of somebody lying up there for four hours is awful. 'I got into the office at about 8.10 and the body was on the floor and there were police up there, and they put a white cover on him. 'I think he was in a suit. As far as I could see the was dressed appropriately, but there was quite a lot of blood, so me and my colleagues were a bit upset.' Others tweeted that what they saw this morning. Amie Hughes-Gage said: 'Just watched the . police finally remove that poor bankers body 4 and half hours later with . only a white sheet over him.' Hetal Patel tweeted: 'The 9th floor roof of JP Morgan is visible from my office window. For a long time the body was left cordoned & unattended'. Another wrote online: 'It's not a nice view from my building. The body is on the rooftop of level 9. So sad'. An air ambulance was sent to the scene but the man could not be saved. 'We were called to Bank Street to reports of a person fallen form a height', London Ambulance Service spokesman said: . 'We sent one ambulance crew, a duty officer, our hazardous area response team and London Air Ambulance to the scene. 'Sadly a man in his 30s was pronounced dead at the scene.' JP Morgan's building has been the headquarters of the bank's Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) operation since July 2012. It used to be owned by Lehman Brothers . until its collapse in 2008, and the area houses the headquarters of . other banking giants including HSBC and Barclays. The horrific tragedy came hot on the heels of the shock death of of Broeksmit Sunday, who apparently had close ties to co-chief executive Anshu Jain. Jain and fellow co-chief executive Juergen Fitschen said in an internal memo: 'He was considered by many of his peers to be among the finest minds in the fields of risk and capital management.'We are deeply saddened by Bill's death. He was a dear friend and colleague to many of us who benefitted from his intellect and wisdom. Location: The body of William 'Bill' Broeksmit, 58, was found at his home  in South Kensington, central London . Discovery: Police had been called to reports of a man found hanging at a house on this road, Evelyn Gardens . 'Our thoughts and condolences are with . his wife and family at this time. We will remember him for his . contributions to Deutsche Bank, thoughtful advice and personal . friendship.' Broeksmit . worked in investment banking - specifically risk and securities - and . lived on exclusive Evelyn Gardens in South Kensington, which has an . average property value of £1.9million. He is also registered to a high-value property a stone's throw from New York's Central Park. Broeksmit's name appears on U.S. government records for the Broeksmit Family Foundation, which is based in the palatial 1185 Park Avenue building. The three-bedroom, three-bathroom apartment to which he is linked was worth $4,500,000 when it was last sold in June 2000. He worked at Deutsche Bank from 1996 to 2001, then from 2008 until he retired. Broeksmit was also employed by Merrill Lynch for a period. Broeksmit was one of around 100 bankers who left Merrill Lynch for Deutsche when its investment banking arm was founded in the 1990s. Links: Mr Broeksmit is linked by U.S. documents to an apartment in this building, yards from Central Park . Offices: He worked at Deutsche Bank from 1996 to 2001, then from 2008 until he retired (file picture) He was involved in the process of rescuing the bank in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, when many investment banks found their debts were 'toxic', and unlikely ever to be repaid. Broeksmit, a renowned risk expert, assisted the bank's efforts to shift the worst of the debt, and reduce its total amount of lending. Chiefs at Deutsche Bank had planned to promote  Broeksmit to its management board in 2012, but stopped when the German financial regulator expressed doubts about his experience as a leader. Scotland Yard confirmed only that a 58-year-old man was found hanged. A spokesman said: 'Police were called at 12.35 p.m. on Sunday to a man found hanging at Evelyn Gardens, SW7. 'Kensington and Chelsea police, ambulance and air ambulance all attended. A 58-year-old man was declared dead at the scene. The death is being treated as non-suspicious.'

The amazing moment was witnessed by French marine biologist Mathieu Foulquie, 39, just five metres underwater on a dive in the Gardens of the Queen National Marine Park in Cuba. 'I felt a mixed feeling between fascination and excitement whilst I was underwater watching the incredible moment,' Mathieu said. The shark's trance-like state is known as ""tonic immobility"", a temporary paralysis caused by rubbing the animal's nose. Mathieu, of Montpellier, France, explains: 'By rubbing the shark's snout, our guide was able to overstimulate its sensory organs, called the ampullae of Lorenzini. 'We were not in any danger at all, but an ordinary diver should never try to catch a shark or even to play with one.

'This kind of manipulation can be made only by experienced divers who know how the shark is going to react.' The state of paralysis lasts for an average of 15 minutes, but most guides hold the shark for just two to three minutes. This allows enough time for divers to approach the shark and touch the smooth texture of its skin. Diving with around 20 sharks, Mathieu was able to watch as his guide carefully interacted with each of them. High risk: The large size and cutting teeth of the silky shark make it a potentially dangerous species .

"Throughout his short life, young Cody Green had admired the bravery of the U.S. Marines. But after years spent battling leukaemia, it was the youngster's courage fighting cancer which inspired his heroes to honour his bravery. The 12-year-old from Indiana had suffered from the disease throughout his life. First diagnosed just before his . second birthday, he had beaten leukaemia three times - but the . chemotherapy had reduced his immune system and, last weekend, he died from a . fungus which attacked his brain. And standing guard outside his hospital room that night was a local Marine named Mark Dolfini who was so moved by Cody's continued cancer battle that he decreed the 12-year-old to be a honorary member of the elite military unit. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Sick: The 12-year-old had been seriously ill for much of his short life, but his courage impressed the Marines . Honour guard: Mark Dolfini, 39, a local Marine, was so moved by Cody's story that he helped make the 12-year-old an honorary Marine before he passed on Saturday due to an infection related to cancer . Close family friend Keristen Ford told MailOnline that Cody was a 'witty' and determined child who never let his continued battles with cancer hurt his spirits. 'He was very aware of his illness he knew exactly what medications he was on and what time he should have them,' Ms Ford said. 'He knew that by him knowing when he had to take his medications and what they were, his mom had to worry less. He was very worried about anyone leaving sleep over him. His mother Tracy Green certainly had a lot on her mind over the past few months, as Cody had two younger brothers and two older stepbrothers. On top of that, Ms Green was seriously injured at the Indiana State Fair as the country band Sugarland's stage fell. Seven people were killed, and Ms Green was one of the 58 injured. She had to have 30 staples in her skull and had steel rods and pins placed in her leg. As she recovered, Cody was characteristically caring, helping his mother wash her hair when she had trouble moving in the months following the August 2011 stage collapse. Fighting the long fight: Cody had leukaemia three times, and at the time of his death he was technically cancer-free but died due to an infection . 'When I started walking again after . the incident, he was so worried about me, saying ""you need to keep your . feet up Mom! You have to watch your step,""' Mrs Green told MailOnline. 'He never complained, he never said ""why me?"" or ""I don't want to do this"". 'If he got sick, he would finish and . say ""I'm sorry"" because you were holding the bucket for him. I always . told him that he had nothing to be sorry about.' Cody's repeat cancer battle inspired . the local Marines, who thought 'he’s fought as hard as any marine has . and because of that we’re going to honour him'. They planned to give him a complete . colour guard spectacle, but because Cody's condition was less stable . following a stem cell procedure on March 12, they had to suspend those . plans for fear of infecting Cody's sensitive immune system. Family: Technically cancer-free at the time of his death, Cody, bottom left, is seen here with two of his brothers and his mother Tracy Green, who was seriously injured at a Sugarland concert last August . 'He had a passion for our country and . our military and it was more the marines got sparked in Cody and they . heard of his battle,' Ms Ford told MailOnline. The youngster's father David Snowberger told local station WLFI: 'They decided Cody, with the strength and honour and courage he showed through the whole thing, he should be a Marine.' When Cody's condition took a turn for . the worse on Friday night, his family got in touch with a local Marine . who said that he would rush to the hospital to be with the boy during . his final hours. Former Marine Mark Dolfini, 39, who was introduced to Cody through Mr Snowberger, presented the boy with a flag and Marine navigator wings. 'Unfortunately, Cody was not awake, . he was on a ventilator, but we believe he knew,' Ms Ford said, having . been at the hospital at the time of the ceremony. Courage: Cody may have admired the strength of the marines - but they . admired him as he bravely fought cancer and his father David Snowberger, . right, said the Marines decided Cody should be an honorary member . Long disease: Cody was first diagnosed with leukemia when he was 22 months old . In keeping with the Corps motto of Semper . Fidelis, latin for always faithful, the Marine stood post outside of . Cody's door all night, saluting Mrs Green as she went in and out of the . room, right up until Cody passed on Saturday. 'The night before Cody passed, he stood guard at Cody's door at the . hospital all night long for eight hours straight,' Mr Snowberger said. Mr Dolfini, who was initially . hesitant to go public for fear it would take away from Cody's story, . spoke with MailIOnline, telling how he knew he had to spend the night . guarding Cody's door because it was what he deserved. 'There was no question that was my calling that night,' he said. 'I didn’t give myself a time constraint and I knew I was going to be there as long as I could be.' The Marine Corp's website states that . the title of 'Honorary Marine' reinforces the special bond between the . American people and the Corps by 'recognising individuals in the . civilian community who have made extraordinary contributions to the . Marine Corps. Support: Cody's friends at Carroll Consolidated School made him signs during his repeated hospital stays . Plea: Cody's mother issued a heartfelt plea from a 'worried and scared momma' on Facebook in the days before he died . Turn for the worse: Cody, seen here with Dave Snowberger, went in for chemotherapy and an stem cell transplant on March 2 and stayed in the hospital for the almost two month until his death . 'The title Marine is a revered designation that affords a special distinction to those who earn it. 'Therefore, only the Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) can officially designate an individual as an ""Honorary Marine"".' Cody - described by his father as 'a . comedian' - was a fifth grade student at Carroll Elementary School in . Flora, and his friends spent the first day back at school after his . death honouring his memory. Balloons in his favourite colour of . green were released, carrying messages into the sky; green ribbons were . tied round the trees and friends hugged each other while wearing green . T-shirts and chanting his name. 'He was very witty,' Ms Ford told MailOnline. Memorial: All of the children at Cody's school had off on Monday and the school held a ceremony where they traded memories about their 'witty' friend . Tribute: Cody's school friends release green balloons in his memory . 'He was very comical.

'If someone . goes there, absolutely 100 per cent they don’t come back.' A year ago, Akram, who has a biomedical sciences degree, was working as an estate agent in London. His Facebook page contains photographs showing him enjoying himself on nights out with colleagues.

"Schoolboys need to have lessons in feminism to help teach them out to treat women, Labour claims. Compulsory sex education classes should be held in all schools to tackle the rise of sexist abuse fuelled by internet porn, Yvette Cooper said. The shadow home secretary warned a culture is spreading in schools where girls are subject to verbal abuse and have their shirts undone and skirts lifted by boys who do not respect them. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said compulsory sex education classes should be held in all schools to tackle the rise of sexist abuse fuelled by internet porn . Schools, colleges and universities are to be consulted on changes in rules – or the law – which are needed to tackle the problem. Labour warns too many boys believe abuse is ‘normal’ and it is fuelling a culture of violence against women and girls. Ms Cooper insisted the problems being played out in classrooms today are more than the ‘hormonal mix of over-excited boys, irritated girls, and clumsy flirting that gets a bit out of hand’. Writing in the Independent, she said the problems are getting worse, with growing levels of abuse and harassment of young women and girls. The National Union of Students is also worried about a trend of jokes about rape and ‘innocent’ groping on campuses. Online abuse and the use of 'revenge porn' are on the rise, while 21 per cent of rapists are under 24, Labour says . Labour would introduce compulsory sex and relationship education into schools, which would include ‘teaching zero tolerance of violence in relationships’. Ms Cooper added: ‘For years we have talked about the importance of empowering our daughters, giving them the confidence to challenge abuse and bringing them up as feminists. ‘If we are going to achieve a real-step change in tackling violence against women, we need our sons growing up as confident feminists too.’ She added that ‘violence and viciousness’ towards women have been tolerated for too long. Labour pointed to figures showing that 21 per cent of rapists and over a quarter of domestic violence perpetrators are under 24. Ms Cooper added: 'So called ""revenge porn"" is growing making young lives a misery when an ex posts their half naked photos or stalks them online.' She recalled one teacher describing how teenage girls face vile verbal abuse on a daily basis. Girls are 'heckled if they dare to speak in class, their shirts forcibly undone, their skirts lifted and held by groups of boys'. She added: 'It would be easy and, let’s be honest, more comfortable, to dismiss this as a one off. Or the inevitable, temporary, rite of teenage passage. 'After all, we all remember that hormonal mix of over-excited boys, irritated girls, and clumsy flirting that gets a bit out of hand. 'Sadly it’s rather more than that; it’s certainly not temporary, and the evidence shows it’s getting worse.'","Yvette Cooper calls for compulsory sex education lessons in all schools .

"Thomas Day has been jailed for nine years and four months after he battered his former girlfriend . A jealous father who weighs 26 stone has been jailed after he battered his former girlfriend until she passed out. Thomas Day, 39, left Helen Callaghan - who is 4ft10in and weighs just six stone - with horrific injuries after he punched and throttled her in a fit of jealousy after learning she was seeing another man, a court heard. The couple's two children, aged ten and six, walked into the room moments after the attack to find their father, who is almost 6ft tall, standing over 28-year-old Miss Callaghan's body. The children ran from the home and into the arms of concerned neighbours. Miss Callaghan’s face was fractured in 20 places, including her cheeks, nose and eye sockets. Surgeons have implanted metal plates into her jaw and cheeks and are trying to reconstruct her face from photographs taken before the attack in June. Police first arrested Day on suspicion of attempted murder, to which he said: 'If I wanted her dead, I would have killed her.' The charge was later reduced to a serious assault. Day pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm when he appeared earlier at Manchester Crown Court. He also admitted a common assault on Miss Callaghan two weeks earlier and a charge of affray after he lost his temper in a pub where she worked. Day, of Fallowfield, also pleaded guilty to importing £1,000 of cannabis into the UK from Goa in India. The defendant showed no emotion as he was jailed for nine years and four months, but said ‘I love you’ to his family in the public gallery. Judge Michael Henshell told Day: 'Jealousy is the most potent and dangerous of emotions and it causes untold harm. 'The . injuries were extensive and almost fatal. They are the most appalling . of injuries. This was an incredibly vicious and forceful attack on a . woman, by you, in the home where she was living, while two children were . in the house.' WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

Miss Callaghan was first attacked by Day on June 16, this year. The pair had a row at their home in . Northern Moor, Wythenshaw, before Miss Callaghan left in the early hours . of the morning for her father's house in Burnage. Day followed her there and scratched her face with a knife, it was said. The following week, on June 23, he lost his temper in a bar in Withington, where Miss Callaghan works. He smashed pool cues and threatened to kill one of Miss Callaghan’s colleagues, it was said. Finally on June 30, Day launched his most vicious attack. As he came to collect the children from the family home, he found messages on her phone that she was seeing someone else. Paul Tonge, defending, said: 'He was a . little surprised to find her still in bed during that fateful visit and . he saw information on her mobile phone which confirmed his fears that . she was in a new relationship. It was like steam let from a pressure . cooker.' Mr Tonge told the . court his client was remorseful and ‘sickened by what he has done’ but . had been a good father to the couple’s two children. Extracts . from Miss Callaghan’s victim impact statement were read out in court. She said: 'The surgeon has asked for lots of photographs from before the . incident and is hopeful he can make me look the same again.' Miss Callaghan declined to speak after the hearing but agreed to have pictures of her injuries published.

"An underwater diver captures the only place on Earth where you can dive or snorkel between two continental plates, the Silfra canyon in southern Iceland. The crystal clear waters flow within the crack between the North American and Eurasian continents, which drift 2cm further apart each year. The stunning images were captured at 49ft during an expedition of Thingvellir Lake, by French marine biologist Mathieu Foulquie. Submerged 49ft deep, a diver explores the pristine waters of the Silfra canyon in southern Iceland. The canyon is a crack between the North American and Eurasian continents and every year these two continental plates drift 2cm further apart . The cold water temperature of between 2 and 4 degrees Celsius, and the filtering process through porous underground lava before it reaches Thingvellir Lake, result in the visibility of 100m . French marine biologist Mathieu Foulquie captured the images during a diving expedition through the freshwater Silfra canyon, located in Thingvellir Lake, Iceland . The 40-year-old, of Montpellier, France, says: 'I had the privilege to dive at the famous Silfra dive site, probably the most impressive freshwater rift in Iceland. 'It is without a doubt a world class dive site, with one of the clearest freshwaters on Earth. 'I felt hypnotised by the transparency, and it almost made me dizzy!' The cold water temperature, and the filtering process through porous underground lava before it reaches Thingvellir Lake, result in the visibility of 100m. The water temperature ranges between 2 and 4 degrees Celsius all year round, as a result of its source being the second largest ice cap in Iceland, the nearby Langjokul. Foulquie, 40, of Montpellier, France, says: 'I had the privilege to dive at the famous Silfra dive site, probably the most impressive freshwater rift in Iceland. I felt hypnotised by the transparency, and it almost made me dizzy!' Foulquie managed to use this visibility to capture the stunning shots between the two tectonic plates. He says: 'I did attempt to have a drink whilst diving in the lake, but the water temperature is about 2 or 3 degrees Celsius, and you're already frozen so you don't really need more refreshing. 'However, because of the lava filtration - which is one of the best in the world - the lake tastes of the purest of waters. 'When people look at photographs, the first sentence is usually 'it looks like they were in weightlessness' - a phenomenon which occurs when there is no force of support on your body.'

"Border guards in Texas are on high alert after two child immigrants were confirmed to have swine flu following their interception trying to cross the border from Mexico. The minors were diagnosed with the highly-contagious H1N1 virus on Friday at two separate military detention facilities in Brownsville, Texas. Both centres, at Brownsville and nearby Fort Brown, were today on lockdown as border officials scrambled to contain a potential outbreak, placing some 120 people who came in contact with the juveniles in isolation. It comes days after Texas officials renewed . demands that the federal government take further steps to secure the . border as waves of illegal immigrants are turning military bases into . makeshift settlements. Scroll down for video . Influx: Mexican immigrants stand in line at a detention facility in Texas. The two juveniles (not pictured) were diagnosed with swine flu on Friday . Worries: It comes days after Texas officials renewed demands that the federal government take further steps to secure the border as waves of illegal immigrants are turning military bases into makeshift settlements . Lockdown: Both centres were today on lockdown as border officials scrambled to contain a potential outbreak, placing some 120 people who came in contact with the juveniles in isolation . Medical teams are stationed inside the detention centers to screen for lice, scabies and chicken pox but not everyone gets medical clearance. National Border Patrol Council Vice President Chris Cabrera said: 'If someone is released and they are symptomatic, it could spread rapidly.' President Barack Obama is under mounting pressure to stem the rising tide of South and Central American migrants flocking across the border in search of better lives. Last week, House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul (R-TX) claimed American military bases are turning into 'refugee camps', adding: 'I never thought I'd see this in the United States of America.' Too young for the journey: A young girl traveling with Central American migrants plays on the freight train they had been riding Friday, after it suffered a minor derailment in a remote wooded area outside Reforma de Pineda, Chiapas state, Mexico . Texas Governor Rick Perry, also a Republican, demanded ‘Secure this border, Mr. President’ in a separate speech. McCaul . also claimed the President’s series of executive actions have made it . easier for minors to stay in the country and put them at even greater . risk for harm. Swine flu is a relatively new strain of influenza that was responsible for a flu pandemic from 2009 to 2010. The . virus was first detected in Mexico in April 2009, but spread quickly . from country to country due to it being a new strain. As a result very . few people had a natural resistance to the virus. It is also known as the H1N1 influenza, denoting the strain of the virus. People suffering swine flu typically complain of a fever or high temperature - over 38C.Other . symptoms include aching muscles, sore throat or a dry cough - symptoms . that are very similar to other types of seasonal flu. For those in high-risk groups experts advise getting vaccinated against swine flu. Those . considered 'at risk' are pregnant women, people suffering chronic, . long-term lung, heart, kidney or liver disease, people suffering . conditions including cystic fibrosis and Parkinson's and diabetes. Many top government officials, including House Minority leader . ‘These . children are often subjected to beatings, starvation, sexual assault and . are at risk of being trafficked,’ said McCaul, according to Fox News. ‘Allowing them to remain here will only encourage the next group of individuals to undertake this very dangerous,’ Perry added. Both . men’s remarks came as many border towns have seen an influx of people . illegally crossing the U.S. – Mexico border only to end up in temporary . prisons and makeshift settlements before they are processed and either . deported or sent elsewhere. A . significant number of these immigrants are now unaccompanied minors who . end up in lockups like the widely-publicized one at a former bus . station in McAllen, or are found dead in the desert – like a young girl . was this week. Those . that do survive the perilous journey are then taken to a Houston . airport and flown around the country to various shelters, according to Buzzfeed. The . hub, in a staging area away from the public at the Bush . Intercontinental Airport… is intended to reduce the amount of time it . takes to transfer custody of the minors to the Office of Refugee . Resettlement, which runs the shelters, the site reported. Those . children, mainly from destitute Central American countries, started . being taken to military bases across the country last month, according . to Buzzfeed. Some of those bases include Fort Sill, in Oklahoma, and Lackland Air Force Base, in texas, according to Fox News. Nancy Pelosi (D- CA), have visited the porous border carved by the Rio Grande River. President . Obama earlier this week sought $2billion in emergency aid to help open . more detention centers across the country to provide ‘basic humanitarian . needs,’ according to White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest. ‘That's . why the president has asked for additional resources from Congress to . open up detention facilities across the country, where these individuals . can be housed in humane conditions’ Governor Perry still blasted the feds after announcing a $1.3 million-per-week program to ferry state agents to the border. Those agents are expected to bolster border patrol efforts, said Perry, according to Fox. The . Governor also called for Washington to pay back the $500million Texas . has spent on border security the past 10 years, Fox reported. Not just in Texas: The building set aside to house between 600 and 1,200 unaccompanied children, mostly from Central America at Fort Sill, Oklahoma . ‘We have been fulfilling a federal responsibility,’ said Perry, whose own bid to run for president during the 2012 election fizzled out before the Republican convention. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) also called for Obama to take a tougher stance on minors crossing the border without their parents ‘who are already in the United States illegally,’ he told Fox. He claimed the parents ‘had a role in smuggling the minors into the United States.’ More than 52,000 unaccompanied minors have been snagged by the border patrol since October, and the number is steadily rising.","Two juveniles diagnosed with H1N1 virus in military camps in Brownsville .
