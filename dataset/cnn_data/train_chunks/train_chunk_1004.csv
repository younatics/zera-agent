"Federal Agents have seized thousands of artifacts including a piece of Adolf Hitler’s bunker from the suburban Indianapolis home of a 91-year-old World War II veteran. About 100 FBI agents have taken truckloads of items from Australia, China, Haiti, New Guinea, Peru and even Native Americans that Don Miller insists he obtained legally. Officials haven’t said whether charges will be filed against Miller since he obtained most of them legally or before laws aimed at curbing their import were even written, FBI Special Agent Robert Jones told WRTV. History buff: Don Miller poses for pictures with some of his artifacts for a recent story in a local newspaper . A piece of history: The lockbox issued to Miller while serving in the Army during World War II . ‘The cultural value of these artifacts is immeasurable,’ said Jones. Aerial footage from WISH showed several tents and trailers at man’s home, squad cars lining his street and even a command center that was set up by authorities. The items were taken from Miller’s home, a second residence on the property and multiple other buildings, according to the Indianapolis Star. Miller, who worked on the atomic bomb, according to the Rushville Republican, never attempted to hide his collection – which even includes a human skeleton. ‘It’s unreal, the full skeleton is what blew my mind,’ neighbor And Essex told WISH. ‘I had even asked him, ‘Can I bring my Grandpa? Can I?’ He was like ‘Oh, sure! Just call me. Yeah, we’d love to show him through here.’ Tent city: As many as 100 federal agents have camped out on Miller's property for multiple days while confiscating the items . Command center: A trailer with a satellite dish (left) is one of many on the property . ‘Hitler’s bunker I think was my favorite. Yeah, the piece of the bunker,’ she added. Miller told the station he willingly invited the agents into his home despite continuing to argue all the belongings are his. ‘He is being cooperative and so far everything is going well,’ FBI spokesperson Paul Bresson told WISH. The former teacher has travelled to over 200 countries in the past eight decades, according to the station. It is not clear how he obtained the items, but he claims it was all through bartering and legal purchase. Items are in violation of treaties and other agreements or laws will be returned to their rightful owners, Bresson told ABC 6. ‘We have outside experts on the scene to identify, preserve and collect the items in his collections.’ The rest will be returned to Miller upon verification nothing illegal contributed to their acquisition. ‘I have never seen a collection like this in my life except in some of the largest museums,’ one of the experts brought in by the feds to catalog the items told the Star. Another person told the Star ‘it may be 30 years, or never,’ before the items are cataloged.","Don Miller told agents the items are all his and were acquired in the course of traveling to more than 200 countries over the course of eight decades .
Authorities are not sure if he will be charged with any crimes since many of the artifacts weer obtained before laws were written to prevent their taking .

"Fears are growing that a serial cat killer is on the loose after more than 50 pets were reported missing in one town in the past week alone. The cats disappeared from Ipswich, Suffolk, taking the total number of pets missing in the area in recent weeks to 160. A Facebook page was set up for owners to report their missing pets - and the site has seen a spike when 52 cats were reported missing in just one week. Shockingly, some cats which disappeared have been found tortured and injured after suffering horrific abuse. 50 cats vanished from Ipswich in the past weeks alone. Left, Freddie the cat has been missing for months, and right, another missing pet . 'None of us have ever known anything like this before,' said Deni Parkes, from Ipswich, who set up a Facebook page for owners. Pictured, one of the pets reported missing . Pet owners are being warned to be extra vigilant after 95 cats were reported missing in Ipswich and a further 65 in nearby Stowmarket since the start of the year. Deni Parkes, 50, from Ipswich, who set up the Ipswich Missing Cats page, said she was 'very worried' as the number of pets disappearing continues to rocket. She told MailOnline theories put forward by some people that take-aways are targeting the animals are unfounded and 'harmful' to the business community. 'There have been a few people who have come forward with the same story but I can't really go into that. It is a police matter.' Mrs Parkes, who looks after two rescue cats, Jasper and Mya, added: 'I just can't believe how many cats have gone.' She met police yesterday in a bid to tackle the escalating crisis and is also holding an event where cat owners can get their pets ID chipped. The number of cats vanishing in Ipswich has rocketed in the past few days bringing the total missing to 160 . Debbie Westwood's cat Millie has gone missing. The 41-year-old from Ipswich has put up posters . 'We put forward our concerns and they were very supportive. We handed over evidence that we hope will shed some light on this. 'Unfortunately, because most of the abuse is not seen it cannot be recorded as a crime. 'It's the same with missing cats - we cannot prove they are missing and name anyone.' Mrs Parkes also called on witnesses to report any cats they see being taken. She said: 'We are urging the public to call police there and then if they see anything rather than waiting until they get home.' Suffolk Police spokeswoman Natalie Doughty said: 'We have met the creator of the Facebook page, Deni Parkes, but police can only investigate if there has been a criminal offence that has taken place, if a cat has been stolen or mistreated. 'We are still encouraging any cat owners to report to the RSPCA or us if their cat comes back injured so we can assess the situation.' Cat owners have been posting details of their missing pets online. The number has risen in the past few days . Kirsty Downing, 37, lost two of her four cats at the beginning of September and is convinced somebody is stealing the animals . Several cats were found tortured last week and speculation is rife in the community that a couple have been spotted luring cats into their car - but there's no hard evidence to back up the claims. Louise Catchpole, 30, said her 16-week-old kittens Nigella and Rupert went missing from her home and returned with burnt whiskers and chunks of fur ripped out. She said: 'When he (Rupert) came back he was limping, covered in faeces and absolutely terrified. 'His whiskers had been burned, there was a large chunk of fur that seemed to have been ripped out.' 'When I took him to the vets they said it looked like he had been kicked around like a football.' Louise Catchpole with her kittens Rupert and Nigella (also pictured left). She said four-month-old Rupert - is of one of 160 to go missing in Ipswich, Suffolk - returned with burnt whiskers and bruises . David Smith, branch co-ordinator of Cats Protection Ipswich, said: 'All we can do is give people advice with what to do with stray cats - keep the cats in out of darkness, make sure it's been neutered and make sure they are microchipped.' A £1,000 reward is also being offered by Cats Protection Ipswich, after a donation of £500 from a man in Scotland, for anyone with information that leads to the successful prosecution of the culprits.

"Facebook doesn't 'like' when its users create fake profiles, even if those users happen to be Drug Enforcement Administration agents investigating a crime. That is the message that the ubiquitous social media site sent to the federal agency this week. Facebook's chief security officer, Joe Sullivan, wrote in a letter Friday to DEA Administrator Michele Leonhart that law enforcement agencies need to follow the same rules about being truthful on Facebook as civilian users. Unfriend: Facebook sent a letter to the Drug Enforcement Administration demanding that its agents stop creating fake profile pages, which is on violation of the site's code of conduct . Those rules include a ban on lying about who you are on Facebook. Sullivan's letter was in response to an upstate New York woman's federal lawsuit claiming that a DEA agent created a fake online persona using her name and photographs stored on her cellphone. In court filings, Sondra Arquiett said her pictures were retrieved from her cellphone after she was arrested in July 2010 on drug charges and her device seized. Arquiett said the fake profile page was being used by DEA agent Timothy Sinnigen to interact with ‘dangerous individuals he was investigating’ for at least three months. Arquiett is asking for $250,000 in damages for using her photos, including 'revealing' images and snapshots of her children. ‘Facebook has long made clear that law enforcement authorities are subject to these policies,’ Sullivan wrote. ‘We regard DEA's conduct to be a knowing and serious breach of Facebook's terms and policies.’ Co-opted: Sondra Arquiett, then called Prince, from upstate New York, sued a Drug Enforcement Administration agent after discovering that he had set up a fake Facebook account using her identity . Facebook also wants the DEA to provide them with assurances that it has stopped using any other fake profile pages it may have created. ‘The department has launched a review into the incident at issue in this case,’ Justice Department spokesman Brian Fallon said in response to a request for comment. ‘That review is ongoing, but to our knowledge, this is not a widespread practice among our federal law enforcement agencies.’ The Justice Department initially defended the practice, arguing in an August court filing that while Arquiett didn't directly authorize Sinnigen to create the fake account, she ‘implicitly consented by granting access to the information stored in her cellphone and by consenting to the use of that information to aid in ... ongoing criminal investigations.’ Last week, the agency announced it would review whether the Facebook ruse went too far. The case was scheduled to go to trial this week, but court records show it has been sent to mediation.","Facebook's rules of conduct include a ban on lying about who you are online .

"A fugitive cagefighter who is addicted to bodybuilding is now being hunted by police over allegations of rape more than five months after he went on the run. Mixed martial arts fanatic Lloyd Seddon, 23, vanished last October while on early parole from a five-year jail term for an armed robbery spree. Seddon allegedly raped a woman near his home in Salford, Greater Manchester in February, but  police have been unable to find him since he failed to show up for a November court hearing after he was charged with assault and affray in connection with a bar brawl. Lloyd Seddon, 23, a fugitive cagefighter branded a danger to the public, is being hunted over allegations of rape today more than five months after he went on the run .

Inspector Dave Henthorne, of Greater Manchester Police said: 'Seddon has a history of violence so is not to be directly approached'. 'However, as you can see from the photograph he has an easily identifiable tattoo of a samurai warrior on his right forearm which, once you've seen, will not be forgotten. We are confident that Seddon would not have been able to resist visiting gyms and continuing to train for his various martial arts hobbies. 'I would now ask that if you see this man anywhere, whether that's in the street or training next to you in the gym, then pick up the phone and call us.'

Seddon, from Lower Broughton, Salford was orginally jailed in June 2009 after a robbery rampage the previous March which began when four men burst into a house armed with an armed with an axe, a wheel brace and a metal bar. The axe was swung at one of the occupants narrowly missing her whilst she was on the phone to her boyfriend. The phone was then smashed up with the axe. The group demanded keys to a Volkswagen Golf parked outside befire fleeing a Mazda R8 stolen earlier from a house. The gang then robbed a BMW Three Series, having threatened another victim with an axe. As they drove off with the previously stolen Mazda, police noticed the cars being driven erratically and tried to stop them. Officers pursued the cars at speeds reaching 130mph. The Mazda went onto the wrong side of the road before it was dumped. Seddon who was a passenger in the car was arrested after being chased on foot by officers. He later pleaded guilty to robbery, possession of a controlled drug, aggravated burglary and aggravated taking of a vehicle without the owner’s consent. He was also disqualified from driving for 12 months .

But he was released early from his stretch and last October was due to face magistrates in Blackpool on a court summons. He failed to show up for the hearing and the following month a police appeal was issued saying he was wanted for recall to jail.

"A Vermont woman accused of working with her husband to murder a schoolteacher was tightlipped during his murder trial on Wednesday. Patricia Prue, 35, only answered two questions from Deputy County State's Attorney Kirk Williams during 33-year-old Allen Prue's murder trial, which asked about her address and March 25, 2012, when  Melissa Jenkins disappeared,The Burlington Free Press reported. Prue invoked the Fifth Amendment 'under my lawyer's direction' following a third question about her memory of a March 25 phone call, the newspaper reported. Scroll down for video . Silent treatment: Patricia Prue invoked the Fifth Amendment during a Wednesday court appearance in her husband Allan Prue's trial . Not my fault: Allen Prue is seen last week during the start of his trial for allegedly murdering schoolteacher Melissa Jenkins in March 2012. His  defense attorneys plan to argue that his wife Patricia is the real person behind the crime . Jealous: Allen's defense attorneys claim Patricia Prue (pictured left in March 2012) grew jealous of Melissa Jenkins (right) She then looked at Allen Prue and smiled at him during her short appearance, according to The Burlington Free Press. The Prues are facing separate trials, with Patricia Prue's yet to start. Forensic scientist Joseph Prue testified later that day that looking at Allen Prue's DNA and parts of a hat which was located near Jenkins' car 'indicates that the hat was most likely worn by Mr. Prue,' according to the newspaper. Last week, prosecutors argued that the Prues called Jenkins and told her their car broke down, tricking her, ABC News reported. Caledonia County State's Attorney Lisa Warren said Allen Prue confessed he and his wife wanted to 'get a girl' as someone 'they could play with,'  ABC reported. She also argued '[Jenkins] got out of her vehicle, and as she did, she was strangled and beaten to death.' Allen's defense last week said that Allen admitted to the crime in order to cover for Patricia, the news site reported. Allen Prue's lawyer Robert Klaims reportedly argued a different view, that 'In [Patricia Prue's] crazy, twisted mind she had become obsessively jealous of Melissa Jenkins. The evidence will show that Patricia Prue strangled Melissa Jenkins without telling him she was going to do it, without planning it with him and without Allen Prue aware in any way shape or form.' Orphaned: Jenkins' was reported missing when a friend found her car abandoned on the side of a road, with her 2-year-old son alone inside . Weak minded: Allen's attorneys say his wife manipulated him in the murder manipulated . Up next: Patricia Prue's trial is set to start next month. She has pleaded not guilty, and her attorneys plan to argue the insanity defense . The couple then took Jenkins' body back to their home where they removed all of her clothes, poured bleach on the body and wrapped her in a tarp. They dumped the body in the Connecticut River, which separates Vermont from New Hampshire, weighing the body down with blocks, and burning the clothes and tarp. Allen reported an hour late to his job delivering papers that night. When news broke that he was involved in the murder, his mother said that he had never been in trouble before and doubted that he committed the crime. Both Allen and Patricia Prue may face life sentences.","Patricia Prue, 35, only answered two questions while she took the stand during the trial for her husband Allen Prue .

"Five New Jersey football coaches whose team is at the center of a horrific hazing scandal have been suspended, it was revealed Saturday. The Sayreville War Memorial High School employees — including head coach George Najjar — were benched from their coaching and teaching positions,NJ Advance Media reported. Some of the five were staff and others substitutes. The five coaches will maintain their pay throughout the investigation because of a state law that proscribes docking pay from suspended schools employees who have not yet been charged with a crime, according to NJ Advance Media. School officials are expected to vote on their next step at a meeting Tuesday. Seven players have been charged with sex crimes over allegations that older team members would routinely hold new players down, anally penetrate them with their fingers, then stick it in the boy's mouth. No adults have been indicted. 'Sick ritual': Sayreville War Memorial High School's football team, some of whose players are pictured above, has been by a hazing scandal. The identities of the players involved is not known . Sayreville War Memorial High School has been rocked by allegations of bullying, intimidation and harassment among players on their popular football team. Here students are seen arriving at the school this week . Superintendent Richard Labbe said there will be a criminal investigation as there is 'enough evidence to substantiate that there were incidences of harassment, intimidation and bullying' on the football team . The parent of one of the players at the high school football team engulfed in a horrific hazing scandal has described in detail how freshman members were allegedly abused. Boys who are new to the team were pinned down by seniors in the locker room, one of whom would anally penetrate them with his finger then stick it in the boys mouth, it was claimed this week. Arrest warrants have been issued for seven members of the team, who play for Sayreville War Memorial High School in New Jersey. And now claims have emerged that seven people at once were required for the sick ritual. Four boys would pin the freshman down in the locker room, and two would stand guard. The seventh would howl, turn off the lights, then carry out the penetration, according to the new claims. The description of the attacks, which are alleged to have taken place almost every day from September 19 to 29, was given by an unnamed parent of a football player to NJ Advance Media on Saturday. He or she described the ritual as 'sickening'. They said: 'Just think if my son or somebody else’s son wanted to leave and they either felt overwhelmed by it, [or] they couldn't leave because there was somebody at the door'. It came as the coach of the team, George Najjar, refused to answer questions to the news website about whether he would resign. He said: 'There will be a time and place when I have something to say, but now is not the time.' All seven of the accused players have been charged with sex crimes. Sayreville War Memorial High School senior Kishan Patel, 17, stops to answer questions from the media as he leaves school Tuesday October 7, 2014, in Sayreville, N.J . A reported hazing incident that 'went too far' and is at the center of the investigation into the high school football team that has resulted in the cancellation of the school's football season. Patel believes when investigation is done, the cancellation of the school's football season will be seen as an overreaction . Three were charged with aggravated sexual assault, criminal restraint, hazing and other crimes for an act of sexual penetration upon one of the children. The four other students were charged with aggravated criminal sexual contact and other crimes. Those in custody were awaiting a Family Court decision on whether they would be held at a juvenile detention facility or be released to their families. Their names weren't released because of their ages. On Monday night, schools Superintendent Richard Labbe announced he was canceling the rest of the season after the prosecutor's office substantiated allegations of hazing involving members of the school's football team. Parents in the township have complained that the whole team is being punished. However, the victims' families insist the gravity of the case warrants the drastic measures. 'In the darkness, a freshman football player would be pinned to the locker-room floor, his arms and feet held down by multiple upperclassmen,' reports NJ Advance Media. 'Then, the victim would be lifted to his feet while a finger was forced into his rectum. Sometimes, the same finger was then shoved into the freshman player’s mouth.' One official also told ABC News, '[The freshmen] would live in fear of seniors and juniors. They would race to the locker room to get changed and get out before the older kids got there.' This was all uncovered when a parent of one child notified authorities about what was happening at the high school. Superintendent Richard Labbe said there will be a criminal investigation as there is 'enough evidence to substantiate that there were incidences of harassment, intimidation and bullying'. He added that these incidences took place 'on a pervasive level, on a wide scale level and at a level which the players knew, tolerated and in general accepted'. 'Based upon that information, we are canceling the remainder of the football season for the freshman, the junior varsity and varsity football programs,' Supt Labbe said. According to CBS New York, Supt Labbe explained that the school first learned of the allegations last week through an anonymous allegation made to the Sayreville Police Department. 'They informed me that upon preliminary investigation, the matter in the incidents that occurred or that were alleged to have occurred, or were of such a serious nature that they were forced to turn the case over immediately to the office of the Middlesex County prosecutor,' he added. No players have been suspended and Supt Labbe would not comment on whether any personnel will be fired. He said canceling the season sends a clear message that this sort of behavior will not be tolerated. 'This district and this board of education is making a unified stance to say 'no.' No to bullying,' he said. Supt Labbe added that in addition to the criminal investigation, the high school is also investigating to see if similar behavior took place within any other sports. Speaking to CBS New York's radio channel, some parents claimed canceling the football program is not fair to innocent players. 'The students can't play, it's a ding on the entire community, it's a ding on the high school,' one parent whose son is on the team said. Upset: Audience members react as members of the Sayreville Board of Education  address a hazing incident that 'went too far' and is at the center of the investigation into the Sayreville War Memorial High School football team . Discussion: Members of the Sayreville Board of Education hold a press conference at the Selover School in South Amboy, N.J., to address a hazing incident that 'went too far' 'For all of them, the ones who are innocent, to have this taken away from them. They're being punished for something they did not do,' another parent added. A number of commentators on Twitter seemed to agree . I feel bad for those Sayreville players,' one person wrote. 'I couldn't imagine having something I work so hard for be taken away because of others poor choices.' But others praised Sayreville's zero tolerance approach to bullying. One person wrote: 'I'm so proud the district took a MAJOR stand against bullying.' 'Was the only choice the program had.' another wrote. 'People didn't want to listen and thought the sport should win out. Safety is priority.' Sayreville High School's football team - which one of New Jersey's top programs having won three sectional titles in four year - has already forfeited multiple games amid the hazing accusations, . Meanwhile, police are investigating former assistant coach of the Sayreville High School football team Charlie Garcia on drug charges. Garcia, 38, resigned from his position at the school after he was found with more than two boxes of steroids and more than a dozen syringes during a traffic stop late last month. According to NJ.com, he was charged with third-degree illegal possession of steroids, possession of hypodermic needles, driving with an expired license, failure to signal a lane change and possession of a controlled dangerous substance in a motor vehicle.","Five coaches have been suspended from  Sayreville War Memorial High School in New Jersey .

"Father Gregory Grant sold all 17 of his new Bristol properties within a week . A Catholic priest who juggles his calling with property developing has sold all 17 of his new properties sold out within a week. Father Gregory Grant, 63, went into business with a parishioner in 1998 and now runs the PG Group from a converted office above his Bristol church. The company has built up a large portfolio by buying dilapidated city centre buildings and turning them into much-needed accommodation. Their latest $3million project in the city centre has proved to be a commercial success with 15 of the 17 properties selling out on the first day, after 66 viewings. The two and three bedroom homes, converted from a former council owned houses which had become derelict, were mainly purchased by young couples. The properties were priced from £149,000 to £195,000 for two bedroom properties and £245,000 for a three bed unit. Stuart Gaiger, Development Director of the PG Group, said: 'This just shows the latent demand there is in Bristol for homes that are within the reach of first time buyers. 'The demand for Champion Court underlines the importance of our decision to go ahead with the conversion of a nearby office complex into 140 one and two bed apartments which will be ready for sale next spring.' Their latest project in the city centre has proved to be a commercial success with 15 of the 17 properties selling out on the first day, after an unbelievable 66 viewings . Father Gregory has always considered God to be the 'third partner' in the business and as such gives a third of the profits to church projects. To date the company has handed out more than £1million to charity and expects this latest success to raise that figure even further. The parish priest of St Patrick's Church, in Redfield, Bristol, said: 'God gives you money simply so that you can give it away again.

'But the world of property management has projects, which have a beginning, a middle and an end.' After being ordained in 1977, Father Gregory spent four years as curate at Corpus Christi Church, Weston-super-Mare, where he became involved in his first development project. The church had an old Scout hall facing the sea and Father Gregory made £40,000 by selling it for redevelopment and using the money to build a meeting room. The Bristol Eye office which the PG Group are developing close to the centre of Bristol . Lewins Mead in Bristol is also being developed by Father Gregory Grant's company . Later he was appointed parish priest of St Patrick's in Bristol, which was scheduled for closure because of its decaying 65-year old church and dwindling 200 congregation. Father Gregory opted to rebuild the church, which now has a new building, convent, 22 retirement homes and a 67-bed nursing home - and its congregation has grown to 600. He officially launched the business in 1998 with parishioner and friend Peter Bradley in a bid to raise a small amount for their local community. Peter Bradley died from a brain tumour a year later aged 43 and his wife Fiona took over his role as trustee. In 2002, Father Gregory launched The Grant Bradley Trust, which helps to fight poverty in the Third World by providing housing and building schools. Father Gregory works from 7.30am to 11pm Monday to Friday in a converted office above his church, but is still able to tend to his parishioners in the evening and weekends.","Father Gregory Grant, 63, went into business with a parishioner in 1998 .

"Burger King has dropped the price of its chicken nuggets in attempt to challenge the McNugget for the top spot on the pecking order. McDonald's is currently in the middle of their iconic Monopoly promotion, and game pieces promising free food and the chance to win prizes have driven in nugget-craving customers. But on Monday, Burger King announced that it was cutting prices on its nuggets, making it possible to get 20 nuggets in its restaurants for 2 dollars less than at McDonald's. Temptation: Burger King is hoping to use value to draw customers into its stores by dropping their 10-piece to $1.49 . 'With the growing consumer demand for chicken menu items, we wanted to offer our guests an aggressive deal rivaling anything our competition has ever done,' said Eric Hirschhorn. Burger King's chief marketing officer for North America's sharp words were reinforced by the chain slashing the price on its 10-piece chicken nuggets down to $1.49. CNBC reports that customers may be benefiting from lower nugget costs thanks to Vladimir Putin and Russia. The country announced a ban of imports of U.S. meats, including poultry, after the United States and others imposed sanctions on Russia over the crisis with Ukraine. 'Historically what we see when we have high beef prices, you see a lot more promotion of other proteins, chicken in particular,' said Bonnie Riggs, a restaurant industry analyst at market research firm The NPD Group. Burger King isn't the only threat to the globe's largest fast food chain. Golden: McDonald's has been the top nugget for years, in spite of sporadic concerns raised over the content of their McNugget . Taco Bell released a breakfast menu earlier this year that has been nibbling away at McDonald's hold over the morning meal. In turn, McDonald's has promoted breakfast through free coffee promotions. The Consumerist notes that Hungry Jack's, Burger King's brand in Australia, was even fighting McDonald's own Monopoly game by offering to honor game pieces for free food in their store. With a ticket for a breakfast wrap, for example, Hungry Jack's customers can get the chain's BBQ brekky wrap, with a hash brown added to a beef patty, egg, bacon and cheese wrapped in a tortilla.","Burger King dropped the price of a 10-piece chicken nugget $1.49, making 20 nuggets 2 dollars cheaper than McDonald's 20-piece McNuggets .

"Modern women may be obsessed with hiding their bumps and bulges, but this archive of underwear catalogues reveals that not much has changed underneath our clothes in the last 100 years. The brochures - dating back to the 1890s - detail how lingerie has been cleverly deployed across the decades to win the battle of the bulge. They document the 1930s solid girdles, employed to accentuate a tiny waist, to the pointy bras of the 1950s to the high-tech control pants of today. We might think of Spanx and control pants as a modern trend but these adverts show that women were using underwear to alter their shape as early as 1937 . Adverts from 1937, featured in an underwear catalogue, boast that you can 'slim with safety - without diet or exercise'. They also highlight such features as the 'studless fastner' which has no 'protruding studs' The 1950s saw a wealth of girdle and corset-type underwear hit the market promising the perfect body . The contraptions were given innovative names like 'hardware', 'health', 'grace' and 'uplift' The archive reveals the most popular shapewear garments sold by JD Williams, one Britain's oldest retailers. Bust enhancers and reducers, waist control garments, and pants that can smooth a troublesome bottom, were all in fashion at some point over the last 14 decades. It shows how strong inflexible materials used in early designs were gradually replaced by more comfortable rubber and elastic, so women could look good both standing up and sitting down. Lollie Todd, lingerie buyer at JD Williams, said: 'We often take the smooth, comfortable, sophistication of today's modern shapewear for granted. 'However this archive shows the sacrifices that women have made in the past so that today's generation can put their most natural looking, smoothest silhouette forward.' The pictures demonstrate how the control garment industry was at he forefront of using leading technology, using newly discovered, man-made materials, and often deploying them long before other markets realised their potential. As well as the advent of colour in popular magazines, the 1960s saw all-in-one corset attempt to create the 'glorious figure of youth' This 1970s advert sees lycra incorporated into a design that promises slimmer waist, thighs and tummy . Subtle but incremental changes show the transformation to today's shapewear, which is now developed using highly technical, computer designed architecture. Components are engineered specifically to combat specific stresses and stretches, spreading the load across the entire garment for a smooth often seamless result. With more than 60 per cent of British women dealing with body image issues sales of shapewear have risen by 40 per cent at JD Williams in 2014. Modern technology is now aimed at strength and comfort using fabric advances to create ranges such as the 'no VPL' knicker. JD Williams includes a Magisculpt Q-Skin range incorporating fabric technology that not only smooths the silhouette but is skin-care friendly by incorporating an anti-microbial ingredient in its core that lasts the lifetime of the garment, preventing bacteria growth and ultimately irritation. But Lollie claims that even apparently slender celebrities such as Julia Roberts, Cate Blanchett and Gwyneth Paltrow use control garment to boost their confidence at important events. 'It has become clear in recent years that there is work to be done in filling the gap in the market felt by women who might not fit into the consumer's ideal, but who do represent the consumer's reality,' she added. 'We cater for women looking for a way to enhance their body confidence whatever their shape and size without the need for extreme dieting.' 'With an ageing population, increasing dress sizes and a growing propensity for home shopping we hope to inspire women to make them feel more confident shopping for fashion.' By the 1980s the strong inflexible materials used in early designs had been replaced by more comfortable rubber, elastic and Lycra . Late 1980s spreads feature noticeably slimmer women showing off the shapewear .

"Bus drivers claim they are being unfairly targeted by traffic wardens who are handing out £70 on the spot fines while they are parked at bus stops. Workers at National Express West Midlands said they feel Wolverhampton council is on a 'suicide mission' to drive everyone out of the city by penalising drivers for doing their jobs. They report being given fines for stopping at designated bus stops for as little as two minutes - which drivers say is essential at some point in the day to enable them to switch drivers. However the council said they had received a number of complaints about illegal parking and wardens said several drivers had been abandoning their buses for long periods. Wardens have been giving fines to bus drivers parked at stops in Lichfield Street in Wolverhampton (pictured) National Express West Midlands workers say traffic wardens have started dishing out fines on an almost daily basis. One driver, who has received a fine, said:  'I think there was six or seven of us ticketed in total. 'Some drivers were there for two or three minutes waiting for a change of driver when the traffic wardens gave them tickets. 'The wardens were telling us we had to move on, but that is always the place where we change drivers before the bus heads off to Dudley. 'It's crazy when you have cars driving through the taxi-only lane up Pipers Row while the roadworks are on. 'They don't get tickets, but we are getting penalised for doing our jobs. Bus drivers say wardens are ticketing almost daily . 'It is as if the council is on a suicide mission to drive everyone out of Wolverhampton.' Wolverhampton City Council said wardens started ticketing buses in Lichfield Street after receiving complaints about illegal parking. Town hall chiefs said no vehicle was allowed to stop in the street unless loading or unloading. They confirmed two fines were given to bus drivers last Friday - but National Express claims the total figure is much higher. A spokesperson for National Express added: 'Some number one buses that had been to Tettenhall were ticketed while they waited along Lichfield Street. 'Several tickets were given out. We know there have been issues there with cars parking in the bus lane which has led to congestion.' Council parking wardens claim they were responding to complaints that drivers had been abandoning their buses for long periods of time for breaks. A spokesperson for Wolverhampton City Council said: 'There have been issues about parking and congestion in Lichfield Street. 'A meeting has been organised for next week with all the interested parties to talk things through and hopefully agree a way forward.' Wardens have been told to stop giving out fines until the meeting is held. Drivers of the National Express West Midlands service claim they are being penalised for doing their job . Passengers on the Number 1 Wolverhampton-to-Dudley service gave mixed responses. Rose Weston, 77, who travels each day to do her shopping, said: 'Where are the buses supposed to park? You can't put them in a multi-storey car park.. 'They stop at the bus stop - that's why its called a bus stop.' Ethel Perkins, 80, added: 'Rules are rules and exist to keep people safe.'","Buses being given £70 fines for parking at stops for two minutes .

"Dozens of diners lunching at a Houston restaurant were left terrorized Wednesday after a SUV stormed through the window from the car park and mowed down customers. The terrifying incident, captured on video from the eatery's surveillance system, occurred at DiMassi's Mediterranean Buffet in the city's southwest about 1.55pm - peak lunch hour. Ten people were injured in the crash, with four of them rushed to hospital, including one man, who was thrown from the window where he was sitting across the restaurant and pinned underneath the car. The female driver, who was not arrested, allegedly told authorities she mistook the accelerator for the brake, according to NBC News. Scroll down for video . Calm before the crash: This is the moment the SUV (back left) approaches the window of DiMassi's Mediterranean Buffet on Wednesday as unsuspecting diners eat . Smash: The SUV comes crashing through the restaurant, hurling two men forward who were sitting against the window .

Lucky escape: The SUV only narrowly misses the two . Safe: The man grabs for his partner as he takes cover and she runs . The owner, Eihab Aldaqamoni, said the roar of the car plowing through the restaurant was so loud he thought it were an airplane on top of the roof. The vehicle only came to a stop when it crashed into the buffet counter. It narrowly missed an elderly couple who were getting food from the buffet at the time. Scarily the incident didn't end there. The driver, somewhat dangerously, backed up the car in the restaurant. However the SUV again propelled forward and crashed into the counter. On the ground at the time struggling to get up from his injuries was a man, identified as a local banker. Not over: The car backs in the eatery before hurling forward for a second time .

"An attorney representing Stephen Collins hit out at the actor’s estranged wife Wednesday, accusing her of trying to blackmail the TV star ahead of their looming divorce trial. On Tuesday, an audio recording from a 2012 couple's therapy session in which Collins allegedly confessed to exposing himself to three young girls was released to TMZ. The bombshell claims concerning the actor who played a pastor on the long-running show 7th Heaven set off a firestorm and already cost him roles on the hit drama Scandal and in the upcoming film Ted 2, along with his position on the Screen Actors Guild National Board. Scroll down for video . He said, she said: Stephen Collins' attorney has accused his wife, Faye Grant (left) of leaking the confession tapes to the media, but the woman has denied releasing the recordings . Suspected extortion: The actor's attorney said Grant has tried to blackmail the 7th Heaven star in order to get a bigger share of their assets as part of a future divorce settlement . Attorney Mark Vincent Kaplan pointed a finger of blame at Collins' wife of 27 years, Faye Grant, claiming that she has been threatening to leak the taped confession for years. ‘Over the course of my representation of Stephen in the divorce case, Faye has repeatedly threatened to give this audiotape to the media unless Stephen agreed to pay her millions of dollars more than that to which she was legally entitled,’ he told TMZ. ‘When these demands were rebuffed, Faye attempted -- without success -- to peddle the tape in numerous ways to numerous different people. ‘It appears that she has finally found an audience for this tape -- not surprisingly, on the eve of the trial in the divorce case where, again, she is seeking millions of dollars more than that to which she is legally entitled.’ Grant has denied releasing the tapes to the media, saying that the recordings were supposed to be part of a criminal case. The estranged wife has filed documents in court listing her and Collins' assets totalling $14million, including more than $5million in property, an art collection worth $40,000, her husband's vintage guitar valued at $100,000, and his $16,000 Rolex. Grants indicated in the legal papers that she is entitled to half of the assets, but sources close to Collins believe she wants it all. A lifetime ago: Collins (second left) starred as Rev Eric Camden on the long-running family drama about parents raising seven children. A still taken from the final episode, 'Goodbye and Thank You,' in 2007 . Bombshell claims: Collins, 67, has been accused of molesting three teenage girls and expressing incestuous thoughts about his unborn child . New York City police announced Tuesday they have an open investigation into allegations Stephen Collins molested a teenage girl in the early 1970s. The complaint was filed in 2012 accusing Collins of forcing a then-14-year-old girl to commit a lewd act in the actor's Manhattan apartment in 1972. An NYPD spokesman said the case remains open and is being handled by Special Victims Division detectives, but no charges have been filed. Faye Grant wrote in a sworn court declaration in Los Angeles last year that her husband had disclosed he molested at least three young girls, including a relative. Grant wrote in the November 2012 declaration in the couple's divorce case that she reported abuse to Los Angeles police, who said they are not actively investigating the actor, but could not offer details on any previous investigations . It's all about the money: Sources closed to Collins said his wife is hoping to walk away from their marriage with all of the couple's assets worth $14million . ‘Stephen admitted that he has engaged in a long-term pattern of sexually abusing minor children, including sexually molesting three young girls over a decade ago,’ Grant wrote in the sworn declaration, which was filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court in November. The report to New York police was made six months after Collins filed to divorce Grant, who he married in 1985. Grant and Collins separated in February 2012, about two weeks after the actress said she learned of her husband's alleged pedophilia in therapy sessions, according to her declaration. Collins filed for divorce three months after the separation. Grant stated her husband has said two of the girls he molested were abused when they were between the ages of 10 and 14 years old. She made even more shocking claims about her husband Wednesday, saying he had sexual thoughts about their unborn child while she was pregnant. She said just before giving birth, Collins told her how glad he was they were having a girl, who they named Kate, instead of a boy who he may have sexually abused. 'The comment you made just before I gave birth to our daughter when you said you hoped we didn't have a little boy, because ""you just didn't know if you could keep his little penis out of your mouth"" was indication enough that you were sick,' Grant wrote in the email obtained by TMZ. 'I should have followed my gut then, and then again 14 years ago, and kicked your ass to the curb,' she added. A source close to Collins dismissed the allegations as 'absolutely untrue.' In the divorce filings obtained by MailOnline, Grant claims her husband used his fame to trick abused children. 'I believe that Stephen used his celebrity status to engender the trust of the families of the children he molested,' Grant wrote. 'I further believe that there have been other victims, but he has thus far only confessed to those three girls. 'I am particularly afraid of what may happen if he does not seek treatment, because he may be working or interacting with children in connection with his employment.'","Attorney Mark Vincent Kaplan claims Collins' wife of 27 years, Faye Grant, has been threatening to leak the therapy session tapes for years .

"The producer of The Simpsons who revealed in July that he is dying of colon cancer has received countless offers from people interesting in his money. Since word got out about Sam Simon’s cancer and his desire to give away his vast fortune he has heard from countless people online asking to help rid him of his sizable wealth. ‘Some people just want a million dollars. Or help with college tuition. And the rest have business propositions,’ he laughed. ‘Like that should be my legacy: to lose money on your movie or your moisturizer line.’ Sam Simon, co-creator of 'The Simpsons,' was diagnosed with colorectal cancer last November and doesn't have long left to live . Simon created the hit cartoon alongside Matt Groening in 1991. He technically retired from The Simpsons in 1993, but still receives tens of millions in royalties every season. In November Simon was diagnosed with advanced colon cancer after a year of inconclusive tests and mysterious discomfort. Having defied that diagnosis’ original death sentence - he was given three to six months to live - Simon continues to push ahead with no whiff of ‘Why me?’ ‘Instead, I think, “This is a really bad situation - and what else can I do to get out of it?’” Wealthy: Simon had a falling out with his co-creator Matt Groening (pictured) and left the show in 1993 but retained a healthy stake in the franchise . The 58-year-old fervent philanthropist is spending his final months funding projects that feed homeless people and save animals from being killed in animal shelters. ‘I’m supporting the charities that I supported during my lifetime,’ he states, ‘and I want to continue to do that.’ Simon grew up comfortably in Beverly Hills, where his father was in the garment industry, not showbiz. After turning his drawing talent into a job at an animation studio that made cartoons for kids, Simon submitted a script, on spec, to the ABC comedy ‘Taxi.’ His script was bought and produced, and Simon, in his 20s, was hired as a staff writer and soon rose to be the showrunner. From there he joined a new NBC sitcom called ‘Cheers,’ where he was staff writer for its ascendant first three seasons. In 1987 he became a writer and executive producer on the Fox comedy series ‘The Tracey Ullman Show,’ teamed alongside James L. Brooks, the comedy legend with whom he had worked on ‘Cheers’ and ‘Taxi,’ and, of course, cartoonist Matt Groening. They became the founding fathers of ‘The Simpsons.’ Write caption here . ‘The Simpsons’ began as interstitial . cartoon clips aired during the otherwise live-action ‘Ullman’ show . until, in 1989, it was spun off as a Fox half-hour of its own. Simon . was named creative supervisor, and he hired the first writing staff as . well as creating several Springfield citizens, including Mr. Burns, the . cadaverous industrialist, and Dr. Hibbert, the buffoonish physician. Although Simon remained the least-known of the three creators, by many accounts he was the most hands-on. ‘You . can't overstate his contribution to “The Simpsons,'"" says talk-show . star Conan O'Brien, who was a ‘Simpsons’ writer and producer in the . early 1990s. ‘No one's smarter than he is.’ The . show - TV's first successful prime-time animated series since ‘The . Flintstones’ nearly three decades before - caught the public off-guard . with its sly but perceptive look at the culture. ‘With “The Simpsons,” people didn't know what they were gonna see,’ says Simon. ‘They didn't have a clue.’ The . show was given time and free reign to flourish by the fledgling Fox . network. ‘I don't think you get that sort of creative freedom with any . broadcast shows today.’ Close: Sam Simon has no children and is not married so he wants to give his millions to causes he cares about. He was married to actress Jennifer Tilly in the 1980s but divorced in 1991 though they remain close . Simon left ‘The Simpsons’ after its fourth season in 1994 owing to a strained relationship with Groening. But . it was a lucrative departure. His exit deal entitled him to royalties . from ‘The Simpsons’ that, as it enters its 25th season this fall, . annually pad Simon's wallet by tens of millions of dollars. He . has played no role on the show in nearly 20 years (not even watching . it, he says), even as his name remains in the weekly credits along with . Groening's and Brooks' - and his checks roll in. This sweet annuity has bankrolled the causes and alternative lifestyle he increasingly came to embrace. Among . his charitable efforts, he established the Sam Simon Foundation, which . rescues dogs from animal shelters and trains them to assist disabled . veterans and the hard-of-hearing. He . donated an undisclosed amount of money to the Sea Shepherd Conservation . Society in 2012 to purchase a vessel for their fleet, which was . unveiled last December and named for him. In . March, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals' Norfolk, Va., . headquarters were christened the Sam Simon Center in recognition of his . support for that organization. Animal lover: Much of his time and attention has been dedicated to the well being of animals, and he runs a home for dogs (pictured are his two dogs Gerty and Columbo) Simon's . largesse carries over to humans, too, including a Los Angeles food bank . feeding 200 families each day in Simon style: with a vegan menu. Meanwhile, he keeps his hand in the comedy world, consulting a half-day each week on the FX comedy ‘Anger Management.’ ‘Probably . the highlight of my week,’ he says. ‘That and my radio show,’ which he . hosts from his home on the online Radioio site – ‘one's on Tuesdays, . one's on Fridays.’ If he . sees this as a closeted and tentative existence, Simon doesn't let on. A . man who boxed for several years as a serious amateur, he now finds . amusement in his inability to even handle a car. ‘Recently . I drove home from UCLA Medical Center in Santa Monica, probably a . four-minute drive,’ he reports with a get-a-load-of-this grin, ‘and I . got into three accidents on the way home: I hit a stanchion, a tree and . another car. No one was injured. But afterward I thought, “Maybe . driving's not a good idea.'"" As . with everybody else, time is running out for Simon, who has learned to . make no long-term plans, including recognizing any prospective end date. He says death doesn't scare him, however unpleasant getting there may . be. ‘I'm not sad,’ he . declares with a wave of his cigar. ‘I'm happy. I don't feel angry and . bitter. I want to do whatever I can to survive.’","Sam Simon, 58, was diagnosed with advanced colon cancer in November .

Speaking to MailOnline about the unique space shortly before its opening, Victoria said: 'It’s the first time people can see the brand through my eyes. ‘I didn’t want a traditional shop window, just a plain window, and a huge concrete sliding door. ‘The floors weren't connected, and I said, “Wouldn’t it be incredible to drill a hole through all three floors, so you could stand on the top floor and see the ground floor.”' Who will win?

She added: ‘I didn’t think it would be possible, but it was.’ Victoria's store is not for those on a shoe-string budget with the cheapest items coming in at £150 for a keyring. And Victoria wanted the rest of her store to reflect the aspirational feel of her clothing line. She continued: ‘We’re not going to have any ugly tills anywhere,’ Victoria explained. ‘Payment is with an iPad, so we can go to the customer on whatever floor she’s on.’ Success story: Shoppers queue outside the Victoria Beckham store shortly before its launch last month .

"Culture Secretary Maria Miller apologised to the Commons in a 30-second statement . Culture Secretary Maria Miller today delivered a blunt, 30-second apology after being ordered to repay £5,800 in expenses. An investigation by the Commons standards . watchdog found she had overclaimed on mortgage bills in 2008-09, and the money must be returned. The watchdog spent almost 18 months investigating her use of the . taxpayer-funded second home allowance and accused her of not cooperating with its questions. David Cameron insisted Mrs Miller has his 'very strong and very warm support' amid suggestions from some Tory MPs that she is being given an ‘easy . ride’ because of the shortage of women in the Cabinet. In her short statement to the Commons at Midday, Mrs Miller stressed the allegation that the taxpayer funded her parents' living costs had been 'dismissed'. But she added: 'The committee did recommend that I apologise to the House for my attitude to the commissioner's inquiry and I of course unreservedly apologise. 'I fully accept the recommendations of the committee and thank them for bringing this matter to an end.' She is the first serving Cabinet minister to have to apology to Parliament over expenses. But Mr Cameron insisted she would remain in government. The PM said: 'Maria Miller is doing an excellent job as Culture Secretary and will continue to do that. 'If we look at this report, yes, of course these issues do matter but she was cleared of the original allegation made against her. 'An over-payment was found which she is going to pay back and she'll make a full apology and I think people should leave it at that.' Over-claiming: Culture secretary Maria Miller is expected to be cleared on the charge of abusing allowances to help fund a second property in Wimbledon, south west London, which she bought for £234,000 in 1995 . One . long-serving MP said: ‘No. 10 is so obsessed with the idea it has a . “women problem” that it stuffs the front bench at Prime Minister’s . Questions with women ministers, however junior, week after week. So . Cameron won’t be prepared to lose Maria Miller.’ Mrs . Miller has been cleared on the central charge . of abusing Commons allowances to help fund a second property in . Wimbledon, south west London, where her elderly parents were living. But . she has been told to repay £5,800 in excess claims for mortgage costs in 2008-09 that . emerged during the course of the investigation by the Commons standards . committee. A well-placed . source yesterday said the sum relates to the fact that Mrs Miller simply . ‘forgot to make the right adjustments’ in her mortgage claims when . interest rates fell. Censure: Taxpayers were billed for the interest on the mortgage. In all she claimed £90,000 over four years for the property which was near her parents' home . More . damagingly, Mrs Miller was also criticsed for a failure to cooperate with the inquiry. Kathryn Hudson, the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner, said: 'Throughout my inquiry it has been difficult to establish information and evidence to the standard of proof which I would have wished. 'It has also been difficult to find evidence to corroborate information provided by Mrs Miller. 'Many of her responses to my questions have been very general and required repeated probing.' Basingstoke MP Mrs Miller, a former advertising . executive, made claims totalling £90,718 on the Wimbledon property . between 2005 and 2009, but stopped after the MPs’ expenses scandal . broke. New rules banning . parents sharing a property funded by the taxpayer were introduced that . year after Labour’s Tony McNulty resigned as a minister over  the . matter. Mrs Miller has previously struggled to explain why she suddenly . stopped claiming on the Wimbledon property as the expenses controversy . erupted. But she insists the . claims were ‘entirely above board’ and that they had been ‘audited twice . independently’. She has also denied using her position overseeing the . Leveson reforms of the Press to warn off a newspaper that was . investigating her expenses. She . said she complained because her disabled father was ‘doorstepped’ by a . journalist, but denied that she linked her complaint to the setting up . of a new independent press regulator. An . ally of Mrs Miller said yesterday: ‘The central allegation that was . made by a Labour MP and the commissioner has been investigating we . expect it to be dismissed. The . suggestion that Mrs Miller is being treated with kid gloves by Downing . Street because of her sex is ‘ridiculous and untrue’, the ally added. Another Conservative MP said the Prime Minister would be ‘loath’ to get . rid of her, especially if the complaint came from Labour. A Downing Street spokesman said Mr Cameron still had confidence in the Culture Secretary. Maria Miller's rented cottage in Hampshire . Maria Miller made more than £1.2million on the London home she shared with her parents after it was sold on Valentine’s Day for £1.47million. The Culture Secretary bought the Wimbledon property with her solicitor husband Iain for just £234,000 in 1995 – while she still worked as an executive for London agency Grey Advertising. Taxpayers have been billed for the interest on the mortgage for four years from 2005 – the year the mother of three became MP for Basingstoke – because Mrs Miller designated it as her second home. But because her family lived there, questions were raised over whether the Wimbledon property was genuinely a second home – and not the rented cottage in her Hampshire constituency that she had designated as her main residence. Mrs Miller was appointed Culture Secretary and minister for women and equality in a 2012 Cabinet reshuffle. The 50-year-old’s clients during her spell in advertising included Mars and she also worked for PR company Rowland, which was owned by Saatchi & Saatchi.","MP's allies insist she will be cleared on the charge of abusing allowances .

"A music video on YouTube went viral not because the song is on the top of the charts but because the singer's bikini top is nearly torn off by an adorable little dog. Kendra Moriah of San Francisco posted her music video on YouTube at the beginning of October along with a video clip of her fighting to keep her bathing suit on as a cute puppy tries to tear it off at a sandy beach California beach. Since posting her music video cover of 'Part of Your World' from Disney's A Little Mermaid online with her band the Dirty Little Blondes, it got an impressive 27,997 views. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Bikini fail: This cute puppy tries its best to tear the swimsuit off of singer Kendra Moriah . New tactic: Kendra attempts to turn away from the puppy as it tugs on her swimming top . Given up?: Kendra smiles at the puppy who is too cute to be angry with despite its efforts to undress her . Perhaps not surprisingly, the clip of her fighting to keep her clothes on her beach ready body featuring a frisky puppy got over two-million views. The clip is cleverly named, 'Bikini fail feat cute puppy.' Kendra Moriah was pleased with the number of people who watched her puppy video but she reminded her 'fans' to pay attention to the music in addition to the wonderful beach view. She fronts her folk band along with her equally tanned and blonde male counterpart Mark Sandusky. 'Hey everyone! Kendra here (the girl from the video) Thanks so much for watching but I must say, it's crazy what the world decides to make viral. That same day we were out filming a fun little music video for my folk duo - Dirty Little Blondes,' she says.

"British holidaymakers seem to give up when it comes to trying to maintain newly-made friendships abroad. Despite 58 per cent of respondents proudly divulging that they regularly make friends when away, a survey of 2,000 people  has found that over half of us (59 per cent) admitted to only contacting our new travel pals once after landing back in the UK. One fifth of Brits (20 per cent) explained how their newly-formed friendships wouldn't last longer than 24 hours once they returned home, with only six per cent managing to maintain their new-found friendships for a month after their holiday. It may be friendship bliss on holiday, but what are the chances of keeping in touch when you return home? Lizann Peppard of Hotels.com, which conducted the research, said: 'Meeting new people when you are at your happiest and most relaxed is part of a great travel experience and being on holiday often bring out the best in all of us. 'It's good to know that so many of us enjoy this part of the trip, even though it can be a struggle to keep things going when we hit home turf.'

"An ancient Chinese paperweight purchased by a widower's late husband for £70 has sold at auction for £170,000. Made of jade, the highly sought after paperweight was dated as far back as 1368 and created sometime during the Ming Dynasty - a period of China's history from which cultural artifacts now sell for exceptionally high prices. The owner was a woman from Cheltenham, whose late husband had purchased the three-inch wide item when he taught in Hong Kong five decades ago. The beautifully crafted Ming Dynasty paperweight, thought to be more than 600 years old, sold for £170,000 . The antique depicts a reclining greyish-green horse and was sold along with the original 1962 sale receipt from Hong Kong antique dealer Dunt King. Robin Fisher, the director of Mallams Auctioneers in Cheltenham, said he did not expect it to sell for such as high price, estimating its value at £30,000 to £40,000. He told the Western Daily Press: 'On a good day, I thought it might have sold for around £40,000 but not as much as it did.' 'Over the years, there has been a massive rise in Chinese buyers, especially for art like this piece and that is why we get people who come to us with items which their relatives, who worked abroad, may have brought back with them.' The sale of the tiny paperweight is just the latest example of a booming demand for Chinese cultural relics. In April, a 500-year-old wine cup from the Ming Dynasty - described as the 'holy grail' of Chinese art - smashed the world record price for porcelain art. Liu Yiqian, an 'eccentric' multimillionaire art collector from Shanghai, purchased the white cup at Sotheby's Hong Kong for £20million. The 500-year-old treasure, which measures 3.1 inches in diameter, is known as a 'chicken cup' due to its decoration of a cockerel and hen tending to their chicks, and is one of only 17 in the world. This Ming Dynasty vase sold for £20million in April, setting a new world record for the sale porcelain art . The price of art and antiques in China has soared over the last decade as the country experienced an economic boom. Thanks to a strong sense of national pride, many of the most desired pieces are Chinese in origin, with works by artists still largely unknown internationally selling for millions. One piece, a painting by Zeng Fanzhi which re-imagines Leonardo Da Vinci's famous 'Last Supper' in an Asian setting, sold for £13million last year - a Chinese modern art record . However, many of the very highest prices are commanded by ancient items such as Ming Dynasty chicken cups and vases. The previous record for Chinese porcelain was set in 2010 when a Qianlong vase sold for £19.4million. There has been much talk of Chinese art prices falling following the market slowdown in 2011, but as the sale of the chicken cup today proved, the richest art collectors are still making major purchases. In fact, Chinese buyers drove Christie's auction house sales up by 14 per cent last year, with the total sale price of £4.27billion a record by any company ever in the art market.","A Jade Ming Dynasty paperweight has sold at auction for £170,000 .

"With a level of detail usually reserved for globes in a classroom, it's hard to believe these replicas of Earth and Jupiter are completely edible. Rhiannon Michell, 26, created the planet cakes complete with core, mantle and crust after her school teacher sister, Sarah, asked her to make a delicious science model for her class to enjoy. The food blogger from Melbourne, Australia, baked the first layer of cake mix and allowed it to cool before placing it inside a bigger batter mix to make the second layer of sponge. Rhiannon Michell, 26, created an Earth cake, complete with core, mantle and crust after her school teacher sister asked her to make an edible science model . Using a tiny brush, Ms Michell painted patterns with food colouring to resemble the planets' distinctive features . This was then baked again and Ms Michell repeated the process a third time and was left with three layers of sponge cake. The inner layer of the Earth cake was an almond butter cake, the middle layer was lemon Madeira sponge and the outer layer was orange Madeira sponge. 'At first I was fairly sure there was no way I could make it, but then my inability to admit defeat kicked in and I had to find a way to do it,' said Ms Michell. 'So far I've made two planet cakes, starting with Earth. I have plans to make more, with one hopefully just around the corner. The inner layer of the food blogger's Earth cake was an almond butter cake, the middle layer was lemon Madeira sponge and the outer layer was orange Madeira sponge . 'I'm hoping one day I will be able to tick off all the planets and their satellites.' Using butter, flour, eggs and sugar, Ms Michell spent three days creating these mind-blowing sponge cakes, which measure 30cm in diameter. She said: 'I have one really tiny and terrible oven, so I have to work on one half sphere at a time and glue them together using a fondant.' For Jupiter, the inner layer was mudcake, followed by almond butter cake and then vanilla Madeira sponge.

'When people see my cakes, the most common response is that they look too nice to cut into. For me, seeing it eaten is the best part. 'The Earth cake was absolutely demolished by the school kids, and Jupiter was eaten by my family. 'I have this ever growing list of cake plans in my head, and never enough time to make them.

"American pop stars Miley Cyrus and Justin Timberlake could be forced to cancel Finnish concerts due to U.S. sanctions against the venue's owners. Both singers are due to play dates at the Hartwall Arena in Helsinki, one of Finland's biggest entertainment venues. But the arena's Russian owners are all close associates of President Vladimir Putin and are included on a list of visa bans and asset freezes, imposed by the United States last month. A Finnish concert by pop star Miley Cyrus could be under threat due to US sanctions imposed on the arena's owners . Now it is unclear whether the concerts can go ahead. The Hartwall Arena is owned by Gennady Timchenko, co-founder of Russia oil trader Guvnor, and brothers Boris and Arkady Rotenberg. All three were the subject of sanctions, which were issued against close allies of President Putin following the country's annexation of the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine. Mr Timchenko and the Rotenbergs bought a stake in Helsinki ice-hockey team Jokerit along with the arena, which is the team's home rink, last year. Justin Timberlake has a sold-out concert scheduled for the Hartwall Arena next month, though it could be under threat . Justin Timberlake already has a sold-out concert scheduled at the arena for May 12, while Miley Cyrus will be taking her world tour to the venue in June. Helsinki concert promoter Live Nation Finland said its lawyers were discussing with U.S. authorities whether the sanctions against the venue's owners would bar planned shows by American artists. Nina Castren, chief executive of Live Nation Finland said: 'We are examining the possibility whether this could have an impact on American artists' shows.' The Hartwall Arena's owners are close allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The US sanctions came following Russia's annexation of the Crimean peninsula . 'If it does, then we will need to come up with a different solution. 'But I believe that the problem will be solved and the concerts will be held.' Timchenko's and the Rotenbergs' company in Finland, Arena Events Oy, could not be immediately reached for comment. The sanctions imposed by the United States mean that Americans cannot conduct any transactions with those on the list. The U.S. Treasury Department has said that Gennday Timchenko's activities in the energy sector are directly linked to Mr Putin, who has investments in Gunvor and could have access to Gunvor funds. The Rotenberg brothers are both believed to be close childhood friends of President Putin and have held big state contracts. Arkady Rotenberg's companies won billions in road contracts in Sochi, the host of the 2014 Winter Games.","Both stars are due to play dates at the Hartwall Arena in Helsinki .

"It was the ranting of a mad woman': Max Clifford's daughter Louise leaves Southwark Crown Court in London, as her father's sex abuse trial continues . The daughter of Max Clifford today told a court that accusations in a letter written by one of his alleged victims were the 'rantings of a mad woman'. Louise Clifford, 42, said the anonymous letter, which accused her father of assaulting a woman more than 35 years earlier, had been written by a 'very disturbed, malicious person'. Southwark Crown Court has heard that the letter was written by a woman who claims to have been abused by the celebrity publicist after meeting him in Spain when she was 15 in 1977. She is one of seven alleged victims of indecent assault in the trial. Giving evidence today, Ms Clifford . told the jury that she felt an 'atmosphere' when her father invited her . to his office to read the letter. 'I knew something was amiss,' she said. 'He showed me and said I’ve received an anonymous letter.' Asked . by defence barrister Richard Horwell QC what her father’s reaction was . to the letter, Ms Clifford said: 'He was just nonplussed. Completely . bewildered by it. It was obviously disturbing. 'It was the ranting of a mad woman. That was my reaction.' During . cross-examination, prosecutor Rosina Cottage QC suggested to Ms . Clifford that the letter reads as though it is written from 'someone . hurt by your father'. Ms Clifford replied: 'I think it reads like a very disturbed, malicious person.' Ms . Clifford, who suffered with juvenile chronic arthritis, said the . condition played a 'significant factor' in her life when she was on . holiday in Spain with her parents in 1983. It . was at this time Clifford is alleged to have put a 12-year-old girl’s . hand on his penis when the youngster joined him and his daughter in a . jacuzzi. The woman is not a complainant in the case as the alleged offence took place abroad, the court has heard. Ms Clifford denied the girl told her about the alleged incident after they had been in the jacuzzi together. 'It’s completely untrue. Utterly, utterly a lie,' she said. 'It didn’t happen. 'I would have been disturbed by it because it would have just been the most awful thing. It just didn’t happen.' Ms Clifford said the allegation was 'very unpleasant'. 'I don’t remember (the woman) and she certainly didn’t come in the jacuzzi with us,' she added. 'If it happened to be true I would say it and say it. 'I would have been disturbed for life.' The court heard Ms Clifford had worked with her father on a daily basis for the last 14 years. Ms Cottage asked Ms Clifford whether her father had driven a 'wedge' between her and her mother. Ms Clifford replied: 'He didn’t.' 'I would have been disturbed for life': Claims that Clifford had forced to 12-year-old girl to touch his penis while they shared a jacuzzi with his daughter were 'completely untrue. Utterly, utterly a lie,' said Miss Clifford . The witness confirmed Clifford had confessed to having an affair when she was 18 and in hospital. 'I absolutely think it didn’t come as a great shock to me because I think I had an inkling,' she said. Asked whether Clifford was 'leading a double life', his daughter replied: 'It worked with his lifestyle easily. He certainly wasn’t living a double life.' The trial continues: Clifford denies 11 charges of sexual assault against seven alleged victims . Ms Clifford told the court she had followed Twitter updates of the trial before today’s hearing but any suggestion she had lied in court was 'absolutely not true'. 'I would not been able to lie on oath,' she said. 'I’m not an actress. I have come here to tell the truth.' Wearing a grey blazer and white shirt, Clifford, from Hersham in Surrey, listened to the evidence with the aid of a hearing loop and smiled at his daughter as she left court. He denies 11 charges of indecent assault against seven women and girls. Earlier, a former winner of television talent show New Faces told the court he never saw Clifford, 70, 'get up to anything untoward'. Singer Tom Waite said he worked with the PR guru after winning the ITV series in 1973 - beating pop band Showaddywaddy in the final - until the Eighties. He said: 'I’ve got no problems with Max’s integrity or anything else. 'I just knew Max was a nice guy. 'I never saw him getting up to anything untoward.' Mr Waite, who told the court he suffers from panic attacks, angrily denied lying for Clifford after he admitted speaking to his former manager before giving a statement to police in January last year. 'I’m getting angry about that actually because I don’t lie,' he said. 'If he’s done something wrong he deserves what’s coming to him.' The trial was adjourned until tomorrow.

"Tomasz Brzezinski (pictured) was the leader of a gang of men who stole hundreds of bicycles from rail passengers in London and the Home Counties . A gang of men became Britain's biggest bike thieves after stealing hundreds of bicycles worth an estimated £75,000 from railway stations. The three prolific criminals were caught on CCTV taking bikes from public places in London and the Home Counties before trying to sell them online. More than 530 bikes were stolen from commuters and rail passengers who had left them in racks at train stations including at Richmond and Twickenham in London. Leader Tomasz Brzezinski, 26, of Ealing, west London, was jailed for 30 months after admitting his part in the criminal operation. Joshua Scott, of Brent, and Zayn Khan, both 19, were sentenced to 18 months imprisonment each, after pleading guilty to theft. Officers were able to link the huge number of bike thefts after monitoring their activity online and on CCTV. Police found that the gang had placed adverts for the stolen bikes online using their own email addresses. Detective Sergeant Paddy Kerr said: 'These men were involved in an elaborate criminal conspiracy to steal bikes from public bike racks and then quickly sell them on for cash. 'They were organised criminals, targeting expensive bikes belonging to rail commuters. 'By disrupting large-scale criminal activity like this, we can continue to reduce the number of bikes stolen from railway stations in the London area.' Officers from British Transport Police found more than 460 online adverts they had put up to try to sell their stolen goods. In one case a woman locked her Condor racing bike in the racks at Richmond station. When she returned later that day, the £900 bicycle was gone.

"Controversy: Patricia Jackson, a Methodist priest in Shropshire, refuses to wear a red poppy when she leads the Remembrance Sunday service . A minister has refused to wear a poppy when she conducts this year's remembrance service because she believes the symbol 'advocates war'. Patricia Jackson told other clergy that she would be happy to sport a white poppy during the proceedings on Remembrance Sunday, but will not wear a red one. Her decision has upset many parishioners at Hadley Methodist Church in Telford, Shropshire, who claimed that the American-born priest 'doesn't seem to realise' the importance of the poppy. Ms Jackson, who calls herself 'Rev PJ', last week told local councillors it was her 'democratic right' not to wear the poppy when conducting the service on November 10. She did not give a reason for her refusal at the time, but a spokesman for the church said it was because Ms Jackson is an advocate of peace. 'Reverend Jackson is happy to wear a white poppy, but doesn't want to wear a red one because she feels it advocates war which is something she does not believe in,' he said. 'She is in favour of peace and reconciliation. She is not doing it to be antagonistic - if anything, it is the opposite.' However, today locals suggested that if Ms Jackson was unwilling to wear the poppy along with most of the congregation, she should not be leading the remembrance service. Church: The service will take place at Hadley Methodist Church in Telford on November 10 . Hadley parish councillor Ron Plenderleith, who served in the Armed Forces for 38 years, said: 'I just think it is unbelievable. 'If someone says they don't want to wear a poppy because of their right to democracy I would say that is absolutely correct, but if they don't want to, don't get involved in the remembrance service. 'The Hadley Methodist Church are absolutely brilliant in the way they organise the remembrance parade.' Fellow councillor Pat Smart added: 'The Methodist Church and all the people associated with it passionately support the Royal British Legion. 'The minister doesn't seem to realise how important it is to us to wear the poppy. This is all political and I can't respect that in these circumstances. I find the whole thing very sad.' Iconic: Ms Jackson says the normal red poppy, left, is overly warlike and will only wear a white poppy, right . David Moore, president of the Hadley and Leegomery Royal British Legion, said: 'From the military members who attend the service - and there are a lot - we were very shocked. 'If someone decides they don't want to wear a poppy, that is down to the individual, but if they are officiating a remembrance service, just for an hour, an hour and a half, it's not going to cut anyone's throat to wear one.' Mr Moore said that the remembrance service would go ahead at the church as planned.","Patricia Jackson claims the red poppy is a sign of pro-war sentiments .

"The Duchess of Cambridge last night cheekily recalled the infamous moment she caught Prince William's eye in a see through dress at a university fashion show. Chatting at a reception with a pretty current female undergraduate at St Andrews University, Kate gave her a knowing glance and asked: 'I hope you weren't involved in the fashion show, you never know what you are going to be asked to wear!' The Duchess and her husband were at a fund-raising dinner held by St Andrews University, the college where they met for the first time in 2001 and, subsequently, fell in love. Scroll down for video . Back to school! The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at a dinner at Middle Temple Hall in London for the 600th birthday of St Andrews University where they met . Lacy lady: Kate first wore the beautiful black lace Alice Temperley dress at the War Horse premiere in January (right) and recycled it last night at a fundraising appeal for St Andrew's University at Middle Temple, London . The University has launched a £100 . million 600th anniversary fundraising appeal to offer bursaries to . bright students who would otherwise not be able to afford to study at a . leading university. Last night's dinner was held in the historic Middle Temple Inn in the heart of legal London. Kate, 30, wore a sexy black and nude . lace dress by designer Alice Temperley that she previously wore to the . premiere of War Horse. Kate's hot! The future Duchess of Cambridge strides down the catwalk aged 19 at a St Andrew's University fashion show in a transparent lace dress in 2002. Prince William was in the audience and apparently whispered to a friend 'Kate's hot!' Pinned onto it was a crystal red poppy given to her by the Royal British Legion. At a pre dinner drinks reception she and William chatted with huge fondness about their university days. The prince spoke of his 'happy, happy . memories' and described Kate, with whom he studied history of art, as . his 'art guru' - 'she was much better at it than me,' he said. He also chatted with one of the . guests, Adrienne Kimball, about how much he and his wife loved their . engagement portrait by Mario Testino. 'If we had asked for that picture . of us hugging we wouldn't have got it. It was just very natural and . summed up how unbelievably happy we were,' he said. Kate spoke about her regret at not . learning to play golf while she was there and recalled being made to . dress up as a baby complete with a bib for the Raisin Weekend, the . university's version of rag week. 'I think there is a photo of it out there somewhere,' she told Amanda Bradley. Mrs Bradley said: 'She clearly loved . her time at St Andrews and it was obvious the way she and William spoke . about each other that they are absolutely besotted with each other.' William launched and became patron of . the university's appeal when the couple visited the university in the . run up to their wedding. Among the guests present tonight . were some of those who have already benefited from such financial help . as well as supporters and former alumni. The couple walked into the Inn's Hall . with a piper ahead of them, before taking their seats in the opulent . Elizabethan banqueting suite. The university's Principle, Sir Menzies Campbell, sat next to the Duchess at dinner. The menu included spiced poached pear . with roquefort, crown of partridge and rhubarb and ginger crumble washed . down with a Middle Temple Claret 2009 and, appropriately, a University . of St Andrews Bruichladdich single malt. In a short address, Prince William . said his time at university evoked 'the happiest of memories, of cold . winters and good friends.'

Founded in the 15th Century, St Andrews is Scotland’s ‘first’ university and the third-oldest in the English speaking world. William and Kate both graduated in 2005 with 2:1 honours degrees. The Duke studied Art History, Social . Anthropology and Geography before switching at the end of his second . year to straight Geography, while his future wife initially studied Art . History, Social Anthropology and Classics before specialising in Art . History. Reminiscing: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge happily recalled their own days at St Andrews during the gala .

Coined ‘Britain's top match-making . university’, it  has a reputation for students meeting their future . husband or wife. As many as one in 10 students marry a fellow graduate . from St. Andrews. William and Kate had a number of . history of art and anthropology classes together in their first year, as . well as living close by in the same halls of residence, St Salvator’s. At the time, however, Kate was dating a . fourth-year student, Rupert Finch, while William had his own on-off . romance with a girl back home to keep him occupied. Legend has it, however, that the . prince suddenly realised the girl of his dreams had been in front of his . nose the whole time when in March 2002 he saw Kate strut down the . catwalk at a charity fashion show in a see-through dress and stutter: . ‘Wow, Kate’s hot.’ Smart and sophisticated couple: The Duke looked smart in a traditional dinner suit alongside Kate .

"Women with ovarian cancer are in ‘critical danger’ of missing out on life-saving treatment because the NHS does not offer them genetic testing, say campaigners. One in five women with non-mucinous epithelial ovarian cancer, which accounts for 70 per cent of all cases, are believed to carry the BRCA 1 or 2 mutation, dramatically increasing their risk of developing the disease. The mutation indicates a form of cancer that responds better to drugs known as PARP inhibitors. Women with ovarian cancer are in 'critical danger' of missing out on life-saving treatment because the NHS does not offer genetic testing . In a report today, the charity Ovarian Cancer Action calls for all women diagnosed with this kind of ovarian cancer to be offered screening for the faulty BRCA genes at the point of diagnosis so they can get the appropriate treatment. Genetic testing is the only way to determine whether a woman will benefit from PARP drugs. At the moment, screening is ‘patchy and dependent on where a patient lives’, warns the charity. Dr Sadaf Ghaem-Maghami, senior lecturer and honorary consultant in gynaecological oncology at Hammersmith Hospital in London, says: ‘PARP inhibitors are more effective at killing cancer cells and shrinking tumours in patients with BRCA 1/2 than those without. ‘They are particularly important for BRCA1/2 patients who have a recurrence of ovarian cancer, and for whom there might not be many options.’ Angelina Jolie, whose mother died of ovarian cancer, underwent a double mastectomy last year after she discovered that she had the BRCA1 gene . Screening also impacts on future disease risk – patients with the gene are far more likely to develop breast cancer further down the line. Ovarian cancer affects more than 6,500 women in the UK each year. It is the fifth most common cancer among women. It is most common in women who have had the menopause but it can affect women of any age. The symptoms are difficult to recognise, especially in the early stages of the disease, as they can be very similar to those of other, less serious, conditions. The most common early symptoms are persistent bloating, pelvic or abdominal pain, difficulty eating and nausea. Other symptoms can include back pain and needing to pass urine more frequently. Source: NHS Choices . Actress Angelina Jolie underwent a double mastectomy last year after discovering she carried the BRCA1 gene. Her mother, Marcheline Bertrand, died aged 56 from ovarian cancer. BRCA gene mutations mean that patients have between a 40 and 60 per cent chance of developing ovarian tumours, compared with just two per cent in women without the mutation. They also have a 60 and 90 per cent chance of developing tumours in the breast that are difficult to treat. Although exact figures are unknown, Dr Ghaem-Maghami says it’s possible that women who have survived ovarian cancer could later develop breast cancer because they did not know about the mutation. ‘If a woman with ovarian cancer knows she has the BRCA 1 or 2 gene she is able to tell her sisters or daughters to get tested, so it’s a really important part of a cancer prevention strategy,’ she adds. Ovarian cancer patients in Scotland are automatically given the option to be tested for BRCA 1/2 after diagnosis, but in the rest of the UK screening is only given to those being treated at hospitals where clinical trials are taking place. These have included trials for PARP inhibitors which are expected to be licensed for general use next spring.","The NHS does not offer genetic testing for women with ovarian cancer .

"Bill Cross, 79, was knocked down and killed by Paul Bithell in a Stoke-on-Trent pub car park . A widow hugged the careless driver who  killed her husband yesterday in court after convincing the judge to give him softer sentence. Bill Cross, 79 - the grandfather of Port Vale striker Tom Pope - died 17 days after he was knocked down by a reversing motorist in a Stoke-on-Trent pub car park last November. Married father-of-two Paul Bithell, 30, was ordered to carry out 120 hours unpaid work after admitting causing death by careless driving. He claimed he had not been able to see the pensioner in the dark when he knocked him down in the Sneyd Arms pub in Sneyd Green. Mr Cross's widow Doreen, 80, wrote a letter to the judge insisting it was a genuine accident, that that the torment at accidentally killing her husband was punishment enough. She said: said: 'It was a genuine accident. I asked the judge to be lenient because I didn't think the lad needed any more punishment. 'I hope he can move on now because I know he's been finding it very hard. As a family, we're just glad it's over. 'My family is left without a dad and grandad but it was a genuine accident. 'It was dark and hard to see. It's been very drawn out but fortunately I have a big family who have been with me all the time.' Bithell faced jail on Wednesday at Stroke-On-Trent Crown Court - after it was revealed he had a previous conviction for drink-driving. He told police: 'I glanced in my mirrors, I saw nothing. 'I looked out and just heard a thud. I opened the door and looked out and just saw a figure lying there. When I realised it was a man I ran to him.' He had half a pint of beer before leaving with a friend in the passenger seat and his child in the back, but was found to be below the legal limit. Mr Cross, the grandfather of Port Vale striker Tom Pope (pictured), died 17 days after he was knocked down . Paul Cliff, mitigating, said Bithell recognises the grief that would have been caused by the accident. Mr Cliff said: 'He wants me to apologise publicly to the court and to the family of Mr Cross. He is genuinely sorry and he accepts the devastation that would have been caused. 'He has struggled to come to terms with the guilt. It is an example of the need for extreme caution when reversing on a public car park, particularly on a damp, dark evening in November. 'Mr Cross was not visible at the beginning of the manoeuvre. As he reversed Mr Cross must have been in the blind spot. 'It was a momentary lapse of concentration. Following the impact he immediately stopped. Although distraught, he acted appropriately.' Bithell claimed he had not been able to see the pensioner in the dark when he knocked him down in the Sneyd Arms pub, Sneyd Green, Stoke-on-Trent . Judge David Fletcher sentenced Bithell to a 12-month community order with 120 hours unpaid work. He told Bithell: 'This is a tragic case. The effect on you has also been devastating because you, for the rest of your life, have to live with the knowledge you are responsible for the death of another human being.' Bithell was also given  a one-year driving ban and ordered to pay £125 costs.","Bill Cross, 79, was knocked down and killed by Paul Bithell in a pub car park .

"Cows could soon be vaccinated against tuberculosis, ending the need for culls of the badgers thought to be infecting them, thanks to a breakthrough by British scientists. Researchers from the Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency in Weybridge, Surrey, have found a test that is able to distinguish infected cows and cows that have been immunised. Currently vaccinating cows against bovine TB is subject to an EU ban because there's current diagnostic tests are unable to pick out an inoculated cow from one actually carrying the virus. Disease carrier? Badgers are set to be culled in . their tens of thousands because of suspected links to the spread of . bovine tuberculosis - but a new breakthrough could halt the killings of the protected species . Cows that are healthy but have been given the vaccine as a result appear infected, meaning they cannot be reliably sold or traded overseas. But now a British team have developed what is called a 'diva' (differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals) test which can show the distinction. Used in conjunction with a new cattle vaccine that is being simultaneously developed, the test could enable the government to ask the EU for the law to be changed - potentially halting further planned badger culls. Bovine TB, which is thought to be spread by badgers, is rapidly spreading across the UK and the government granted the first licences for culling the nocturnal alleged disease spreaders last month. Controlling TB in cattle has cost the taxpayer £500million in the past decade, and costs could spiral to £1billion over the next ten years without action, according to the Department for Rural Affairs. However, the decision has angered animal charities which prefer a vaccination programme for badgers or cattle - and hardcore animal rights activists have vowed to take action to stop the exterminations. An effective new TB vaccine for cows and the test to determine their immunity to the disease could save the badgers, but they must first be validated by regulatory agencies. That process, which has to happen before EU law could be altered, 'may take years', said government Chief Veterinary Officer Nigel Gibbens. Over the years, food writer Clarissa Dickson Wright has made it clear there is not much she would object to eating. And, true to form, the former star of the BBC’s Two Fat Ladies, pictured right, has now suggested that we should start eating badgers to be killed in the controversial forthcoming cull. Miss Dickson Wright, 65, said: ‘It would solve the problem. There’s going to be a cull, so rather than just throw them in the landfill site why not eat them? She went on: ‘There are too many badgers. It’s very interesting - the reason at certain times of the year you see so many dead badgers on the road is that the badgers throw out their old and ill that aren’t going to survive the winter. ‘I would have no objection to eating badgers. I have no objection to eating anything very much, really. Staple food of the population, well before rabbit because rabbit was a luxury food.’ Miss Dickson Wright said centuries ago the badger had been widely consumed. And when she was younger it was still a popular bar snack. She said: ‘Rabbit in the middle ages cost a man’s week’s wages for a single rabbit. People ate badger because badger was plentiful.' It has been illegal to kill badgers or disrupt their sets since the 1992 Protection of Badgers Act – which was brought in to prevent badger hunting and baiting which saw their numbers plummet. 'We're determined to push this through,' Mr Gibbens told the Independent. 'But to get the vaccine and the test sorted, and a change in EU law, is some years away. I really would like to say we could accelerate this whole process, but I think ""years"" is right.' In the meantime badger culls, which are overwhelmingly backed by farmers but vehemently opposed by animal rights campaigners, are set to begin in the next fortnight in pilot areas in Gloucestershire and Somerset. Operating at night, with bait laid nearby to entice these notoriously shy creatures, marksmen will use .22 calibre rifles and night-sights to kill at least 3,000 creatures, or 70 per cent of the local population. The hope is that this pilot, if shown to stop the spread of TB in cattle, will be extended across England over the next four years, leading to more than a third of the estimated 300,000 badger population being exterminated. However campaigners argue there is no scientific evidence it would work. A ten-year study commissioned by Defra found a cull would make ‘no meaningful contribution’ to the disease, and could make the problem worse by scaring and dispersing them. And with public sentiment against the cull and a string of celebrities registering their opposition, it will not take place without a fight. Police also suspect that violent extremists involved in previous acts of violence and firebombings are set to hijack the campaign against the cull. ‘Everything is fair game,’ one animal rights campaigner warned the Mail On Sunday earlier this month. ‘We’ve torn up all the stuff about peaceful protests. We’ve got people coming here from around the world. This is going to be huge.’ Queen guitarist Brian May supports the Team Badger campaign which is now being infiltrated by extremists . Celebrities are raising the profile of the campaign against the cull. Stephen Fry, Dame Judi Dench, Joanna Lumley and Jilly Cooper are calling for it to be postponed until a ruling has been made by the European courts on whether the Government is acting illegally in allowing the cull of a protected species. And the RSPCA is among campaigning groups which have predicted that shoppers will to refuse to buy dairy products sourced from farms where culling is taking place. The charity said that while it is not calling for a boycott, consumers will vote with their feet. Those opposed to planned cull of badgers in Gloucestershire and Somerset may also choose not to holiday there. Gavin Grant, the RSPCA’s chief executive, said: ‘Those who care will not want to visit areas or buy milk from farms soaked in badgers’ blood.’","Vaccinating cows against TB currently banned under EU law because there is now way to distinguish them from infected cows .

"Dr Nemat Shafik said more should be done to punish traders following a series of 'truly shocking evidence' The woman charged with cleaning up the City of London has launched a stinging attack on ‘outrageous’ behaviour in the financial markets. Bank of England Deputy Governor Nemat Shafik said last night that more could be done to punish traders following ‘a series of appalling cases of misconduct’ over recent years. The 52-year-old highlighted ‘truly shocking evidence’ of traders manipulating the prices of everything from gold and oil to lead and coffee, as well as fixing interest rates and currencies. ‘I find this behaviour outrageous,’ she said in her first speech since being brought in by Governor Mark Carney to root out wrongdoing and restore trust in financial markets. Speaking at the London School of Economics last night, Dr Shafik said: ‘The initial argument that it is just the case of a few bad apples is no longer credible. It seems there were deep-rooted problems.’ Dr Shafik, who studied at the LSE and Oxford and was permanent secretary at the Department for International Development for three years before joining the International Monetary Fund, is now leading a review into the Fixed Income, Currency and Commodity markets (FICC). She said: ‘It is clear that, in the run-up to the crisis, some firms in FICC markets had allowed the culture on their trading floors to get out of control.’ Egyptian-born Dr Shafik said she was particularly struck at the ‘casual’ attitude of traders involved in the scandals, and that the review she is heading to tackle their ‘anything goes’ attitude should think about imposing harsher punishments. ‘The review wants to consider whether more needs to be done to punish misconduct,’ she said. She highlighted the case of one Lloyds trader who sent a message to his manager about a request to manipulate Libor interest rates – used to set savings and borrowing rates throughout the economy. Playing on the Tesco slogan, he joked: ‘Every little helps… it’s like Tesco.’ Dr Shafik pointed out that, far from being concerned, the manager simply replied: ‘Absolutely, every little helps.’ The damning exchange was published by regulators in July as the state-backed lender was fined £217million for rigging Libor. Barclays was fined £290million in June 2012 for its part in fixing the rate, and another £26million in May this year for rigging gold prices. Dr Shafik cited the example of one Lloyd's trader who sent a message to his manager about a request to manipulate Libor interest rates (The Lloyd's Building in the City of London is pictured) It is also fighting a £300million penalty in the US for manipulating electricity prices. Dr Shafik, who is known by her nickname Minouche and is arguably the most powerful woman in the City, said progress has been made to clean up the financial markets, including a clampdown on bumper bonuses, however, she added: ‘The risk is that, as memories of recent enforcement cases fade, bad practices may re-emerge. Some say that may already be happening.’ Although the string of financial scandals has cast a shadow over the lenders, not a single senior banker has been jailed. But the manipulation of the Libor interest rate has now been made a criminal offence carrying a jail term of up to seven years. The Government now wants to extend this to cover the rigging of other markets.","Dr Nemat Shafik said she had 'truly shocking evidence' of misconduct .

"Russian customs officer opened luggage belonging to the band Roxette and posted pictures of themselves with the musical instruments. The stunt was exposed when fans of the group spotted the images on social media in Russia and sent them to the band's management. Roxette, a Swedish pop rock duo fronted by Marie Fredriksson and Per Gessle, are in Russia performing 13 dates across the country as part of their current world tour. Fans spotted the images of Roxette's musical instruments online, with the duo Marie Fredriksson and Per Gessle pictured performing here, and sent them to the band's management who contacted airport officials . An official in Domodedovo airport, pictured left, marvels at a drum belonging to Roxette, while photos of the instruments were later posted on social in media in Russia, pictured right, alerting the group's management . Roxette's equipment was transported through Moscow's Domodedovo airport for their 13 concerts in Russia . The band said it would not make a formal complaint because nothing was taken from the luggage. The photographs were taken by customs officials working in the Russian capital Moscow's Domodedovo airport. They show luggage containing the band's equipment had been opened and photographed, in some cases with airport workers in the pictures. The pictures were then passed on to the band, who posted them online themselves to show the sort of problems they face during their tour. Mikky Lindstorm, 42, who is running the tour by the Swedish band, said it was clear the images were taken at the airport but that it seemed nobody wanted to comment on the matter. He said it was not the first time the band suspected its equipment, which was clearly labelled as being property of Roxette, had been opened and messed around with. However, he said they would not be making a complaint because technically nothing was missing and therefore no crime had been committed. The Scandinavian duo, which formed in 1986, shot to fame three years later with the hit song 'The Look' from their 'Look Sharp' album. The tune hit number 1 in the Billboard US charts. The pop rock pair, with Fredriksson, 56 on vocals and Gessle, 55, on vocals and guitar, will take their current world tour  to countries including Lithuania, Estonia, Finland and Australia and New Zealand.","Officials in Moscow's Domodedovo airport posted snaps online of drums .

"Britain's aid funding came under fire again last night after an Indian spaceship reached Mars. The country, which is receiving £1.1billion from Britain over four years, entered an elite club of nations to have put a craft into orbit round the Red Planet. India spends vast sums on defence and even has its own overseas aid programme worth £328million a year. Scroll down for videos . Thumbs up: India's low-cost mission to Mars successfully entered the red planet's orbit on this morning. Pictured are staff from the Indian Space Research Organisation celebrating the success of the mission . But despite rapid economic development, it became the biggest net recipient of British aid in 2010 when it received £421million. Britain’s overall aid spending will rise by 30 per cent this year as David Cameron hits his target of 0.7 per cent of economic output. Spending on areas such as policing, prisons and defence have been slashed in recent years as part of efforts to cut Britain’s £90billion annual budget deficit. Big spenders: A comparison of how much countries have spent on their attempts to reach Mars. Both Russia and the US failed their first attempts to Mars, while the Chinese mission to Mars, dubbed Yinghuo-1 mission failed in 2011 and the Japanese mission to Mars ran out of fuel .

On average, it lies 141.6 million miles from the sun. With a diameter of 4,222 miles, it’s around half the size of the Earth and has an average temperature of -85F (-65C). Gravity is much less powerful - slightly less than 40 per cent of ours. The atmosphere is desperately thin – one per cent of Earth’s pressure – and  95 per cent of it is carbon dioxide. It boasts the solar system’s biggest mountain – Olympus Mons, a dead volcano. It measures 335 miles across and rises to a height of 88,000ft, which is almost three times higher than Everest.Mars has two cosmic sidekicks – the moons Deimos and Phobos. Mars’s red colouring comes from the iron oxide that coats its surface. Mars has huge amounts of ice at its polar caps.If they melted, it would cover the whole planet in water 11-metres deep, according to Nasa. But aid spending is spiralling and this year will reach £12.6billion a year – more than the £12.1billion spent on policing. In 2012 International Development Secretary Justine Greening announced that Britain will stop aid to India after this parliament. The spacecraft – Mangalyaan, which means ‘Mars craft’ in Hindi – blasted off from a small Indian island on November 4 last year. It arrived on schedule yesterday after a 485million-mile journey. The £45million project will see the satellite search for methane gas in the planet’s geology and atmosphere. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said: ‘We have gone beyond the boundaries of human enterprise and innovation. We have navigated our craft through a route known to very few.’ But critics questioned why India spends so much on a space programme when so many of its people live in poverty. One economist condemned the space mission as a ‘delusional quest for superpower status’ at a time when half of Indian children are malnourished. A poll last year found just one in four people supports Britain spending billions of pounds on foreign aid every year – and more than 60 per cent believe the cash is wasted. Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘If India can afford this pioneering project then it is hard to justify sending a single penny of taxpayers’ cash in overseas aid when they could be doing more to help themselves.’ A spokesman for the Department for International Development said: ‘Not a penny of British taxpayers’ aid money has gone on India’s space programme. ‘India’s recent progress means that all financial grants from the UK to India will cease in 2015, after which we will focus on providing help in the form of private sector expertise and technical assistance that will also ultimately benefit British businesses and jobs.’ Tory backbenchers have urged Mr Cameron to abandon his aid target. But earlier this month, Downing Street backed a Lib Dem Bill which would enshrine the pledge in law. Nasa's Curiosity Rover Twitter account tweeted a congratulations message to ISRO's Mars Orbiter, to which it replied 'Keep in touch. I'll be around' Vigilant: Indian scientists and engineers from the Indian Space Research Organisation monitor India's Mars Orbiter Mission . As India makes makes space history on Mars, Russia is hoping to do the same on the moon by 2030.

"A British man suspected of being the first UK citizen to die of Ebola did not have the deadly virus, officials have confirmed today. Colin Jaffray, 58, from Royston, Hertfordshire, was struck down with a fever, vomiting and internal bleeding during a business trip to Macedonia - and died in hospital on Thursday evening. Officials in Skopje say that although the cause of death was not known, it is thought that a drinking binge may have played a part in his death. Colin Jaffray, a Briton who died after showing symptoms of Ebola in Macedonia did not have the virus, it has been confirmed . It was feared that Mr Jaffay, a married father-of-three had contracted the infection after showing symptoms of the condition, even though he had not travelled to an Ebola infected country in West Africa. However officials in the capital Skopje confirmed today that they have ruled out the infection as a cause of death. Dr Jovanka Kostovska, Macedonia's head of infection control said: 'We have just received the results from the lab in Hamburg and they are negative for Ebola, which means that the patient did not have the Ebola virus.' A senior health official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that authorities had 'serious indications' that the man had consumed large amounts of alcohol. 'So the theory that this might be the cause of death is very much in play,' he said. Mr Jaffay had travelled to the Balkan country with Mike English, who claimed that the 58-year-old had been 'shaking' and 'confused' in the hours before his death but had refused to see a doctor. He said: 'For two days he was saying he didn't feel good. He had fever but refused to go to the doctor. 'That morning he said he felt better. We agreed to meet downstairs at the hotel at noon. He called and said he didn't feel good, his hands were shaking. He was confused. The hotel staff then called for an ambulance'. Mr Jaffay had stayed in his hotel room for three days with severe stomach ache but was rushed to hospital on Thursday afternoon but died within 90 minutes. Medical staff in protective suits arrive at the Hotel Super 8, Skopje, Macedonia where Colin Jaffray was staying for three days before his death . After Mr Jaffay's death, people staying at the hotel were quarantined for 48 hours . Macedonian police guard the entrance of the quarantined hotel in Skopje as doctors in protective suits leave carrying evidence . But speaking from his hotel room yesterday Mr English, 72, denied his friend had an alcohol problem. 'The suggestion that he was an alcoholic was certainly not true. He did not drink more than anyone else,' he said. He said that Mr Jaffray was a married father of three from Cambridge, and said that he had visited Africa six years ago. Jovanka Kostovska of the Macedonian Health Ministry, who confirmed they had ruled out Ebola as the cause of Mr Jaffay's death . Yesterday Mr English's wife Olga told MailOnline at their home in Bedfordshire Mr Jaffray was 'healthy and jokey' the night before he left the country nine days ago. She said: 'I don't know what kind of bug Colin got but it's not Ebola, I'm sure of that.' She added that  Mr Jaffray had suffered an 'illness related to the nervous system' for years and had always 'refused to go to his GP'. She claimed he would often shake and had been admitted to hospital in Macedonia a number of times before during business trips to Skopje. She said: 'Colin doesn't have an alcohol problem. He had a drink every now and then but no more than anybody else. 'He had a long term health problem but he never went to the doctors. Everyone was saying he should have gone to the doctors but he wouldn't listen. 'It wasn't viral, he had it for a long time, a number of years. Everybody knew he had it and everybody told him to go to the doctors but he never did. 'Every time he went to Macedonia it would be something. He would fall down or it would be something else. It was related to something more serious that's wrong with him that nobody knows about. 'I think that's what has happened not ebola. Its not viral, its something to do with his nervous system like Parkinsons, he shakes a lot. 'They are expecting the test results tomorrow then I don't know when [Mr English] will be home. Hopefully straight away. 'Apparently Colin passed on a meeting because he wasn't feeling very well, Michael went to it by himself then when he came back to the hotel Colin had been taken to hospital. 'Its very sad. He was a really nice man and very intelligent. I think he went to Cambridge University.' Medical staff monitor passengers' body temperature with a thermal camera at Skopje Airport after British citizen Colin Jaffray died . The authorities believe Mr Jaffray had travelled to Skopje directly from Britain and had not been in any country known to have Ebola outbreaks . The UK Foreign Office said it has been investigating the incident. So far the epidemic, the worst on record since Ebola was discovered in 1976, has claimed 4,00 lives and infected at least 8,000 people. Public Health England has said it believed it was 'unlikely' that the death was caused by the virus but investigations were continuing. Dr Brian McCloskey, of Public Health England, said: 'Public Health England is aware there are unconfirmed reports of a British national dying in Macedonia, who may have exhibited some symptoms compatible with Ebola. 'We understand Ebola to be unlikely as the cause of death but will continue to work with partners to investigate.' The unnamed man will be the first British victim of the Ebola outbreak that has killed thousands in West Africa and has spread to North America and Europe, if reports are confirmed . Yesterday Macedonian TV station Alfa TV reported the patient was admitted to an infection clinic in the city with symptoms of the disease. When admitted to the hospital, the patient was unable to communicate and passed away shortly after.A spokesman from the Macedonian foreign ministry said: 'I can confirm that a British person has died and he is in the state hospital in Skopje. 'We are looking to see what are the reasons according to the protocols of the World Health Organization. 'There was a friend with him and he has also been retained in the hospital and the crew from the ambulance are also retained in the hospital.' A Health Ministry official said the man had arrived in Skopje from Britain a week ago and had been rushed to hospital at 3pm on Thursday, where he died several hours later. Dr. Jovanka Kostovska of the ministry's commission for infectious diseases said the man had been suffering from fever, vomiting and internal bleeding, and that his condition deteriorated rapidly. 'These are all symptoms of Ebola, which raises suspicions with this patient,' Kostovska told a news conference, adding that samples had been sent to Germany for tests to confirm the cause of death. Staff of the hotel where the two Britons stayed had also been quarantined, as had the ambulance team and medical staff that treated the deceased. The only British citizen to have been infected with Ebola was nurse Will Pooley who survived despite catching the virus while working to help victims in Sierra Leone. British Ebola survivor William Pooley, 29, a nurse who contracted the disease in Sierra Leone . Earlier this month the 29-year-old told an international summit  the world must avoid 'at all cost' the 'horror and misery' of watching young children die from the disease in horrific, squalid conditions. Mr Pooley, from Suffolk,  returned from a life-saving mission to the U.S. where he gave blood to try and help another victim of the virus, a friend he worked with in Sierra Leone helping victims. The British government have ordered airports to quiz passengers arriving from West Africa in an attempt to prevent Ebola entering the UK, just hours after ministers said it would do little to curb the spread of the deadly virus. But experts told MailOnline 'shutting borders will not stop Ebola', as leading experts say the key to tackling the vicious virus is 'rooting it out' at the source, in West Africa. Dr Ben Neuman, a virologist at the University of Reading, told MailOnline: 'Shutting borders will not stop Ebola, you have to root it out.' He added: 'The longer this goes on the more likely it is we may see a case in the UK. 'But the UK deals with things like this effectively, they (the authorities) handle it. 'They are ready enough and have the capacity. There are a lot of doctors and nurses here who have been out there (to West Africa) with Doctors Without Borders, and so who have Ebola experience, which is invaluable.' Meanwhile Professor Robert Dingwall, a specialist in health policy responses to infectious diseases at Nottingham Trent University accused the US of 'gesture politics', by introducing temperature screening at five airports. He told MailOnline: 'Controls are costly to enforce, inconvenience people and disrupt economic activity while having little or no impact on the spread of infections.' The British government tonight ordered airports to quiz passengers arriving from West Africa in an attempt to prevent Ebola entering the UK . 'We have to work now so that it is not the world's next AIDS,' said Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Tom Frieden, pictured . Experts say the most effective method of tackling the outbreak is to direct resources and funds to fighting the disease in West Africa, welcoming news the UK has vowed to deploy 750 soldiers and a medical warship to Sierra Leone. A U.S. health chief has warned the outbreak could become the 'next Aids', unless drastic action is taken to halt the crisis. 'We have to work now so that it is not the world's next AIDS,' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Tom Frieden told the heads of the United Nations, World Bank and International Monetary Fund gathered in Washington. 'I would say that in the 30 years I've been working in public health, the only thing like this has been AIDS,' he added, warning of a 'long fight' ahead.","Officials say Colin Jaffay, 58 did not die of the deadly Ebola virus .

"Nigella Lawson faces the humiliation of being drug tested to prove she is clean if she wants to visit the US. The celebrity cook was barred from boarding a flight to Los Angeles at the weekend after her courtroom admission she took cocaine and cannabis. The US embassy in London has  now invited her to apply for a visa. But law experts have warned that officials are likely to insist she is tested for illegal substances. Scroll down for video . Nigella Lawson in London after she was prevented from flying to the U.S., whose embassy has now invited her to apply for a visa . Miss Lawson, 54, would then have to be . examined by an embassy-approved doctor and provide a clean blood or . urine sample before she could be cleared to travel to the US again. Her . television career in the States – she has recently been a judge on the . American version of cookery show The Taste – is now in peril. The . Daily Mail revealed  yesterday how Miss Lawson was stopped from . getting  on a British Airways flight from Heathrow to LA on  Sunday. She . was barred under strict American laws which technically exclude  any . foreigner who admits committing drugs offences  in their home country – . even if they were never charged  or convicted. Miss . Lawson confessed during the trial of her former assistants in December . that she had snorted cocaine seven times and smoked cannabis in front of . her two children. The lifting of her travel ban could mean Ms Lawson is free to resume her TV career in the US, where she is a judge on talent show, The Taste . Ms Lawson admitted taking cocaine when she appeared at the trial of her and ex-husband Charles Saatchi's personal assistants . The TV . cook told the court she last took cocaine in  2010 to cope with the . ‘intimate terrorism’ of her then-husband, Charles Saatchi, 70. But she . admitted she had smoked cannabis ‘in the  last year of my marriage to . Mr Saatchi’. The couple . divorced last July, suggesting Miss Lawson may have used the drug within . the past 12 months. This could prove significant for the US . authorities, who will insist on drug tests if they believe she has a . recent history of narcotic abuse. Steven . Heller, a US immigration lawyer based in Britain, said: ‘A drugs test . is pretty much standard if there is a suggestion of recent drug use. 'Certainly if there was something within the past year, they would send . her for a drug test.’ It is . understood that as of yesterday Miss Lawson had not applied for a visa . through the US embassy in London. But once she does, she will  be . invited to attend a face- to-face interview with a consular officer. Ahead of her planned trip to LA, Ms Lawson tweeted a pictured of her travel 'essentials', including a sun hat, Colman's mustard and a sachet of salt . As she appeared outside her home in central London this week, Ms Lawson's representatives refused to comment on the travel saga . She . could then be told she needs to attend  a medical examination with . embassy-approved doctors  in Knightsbridge. Adults . seeking a visa in  London must pay £235 for a basic medical examination . and £48 for a drug test, according to a document on the US State . Department’s website. According to one former visa applicant, Miss . Lawson may also have to go through the degrading experience of being . watched as she provides a urine sample to ensure her drug test results . are not faked. Miss Lawson . is thought to have tried to enter the US on Sunday under the visa waiver . programme, whereby travellers must register online and confirm they . have never been arrested for or convicted of certain offences. Ms Lawson was prevented from boarding a flight to LA after arriving at Heathrow Airport's Terminal Five on Sunday morning . A spokesman for the US Embassy said staff understood Ms Lawson has 'professional requirements' in the U.S. and her case would be 'handled routinely and expeditiously' The . specific grounds on which she was barred entry have not been officially . confirmed. She is now expected to engage lawyers to ensure she can . travel freely to America, which she visits regularly both for pleasure . and for work. Miss Lawson . insisted during the trial of her housekeepers, Elisabetta and Francesca . Grillo that she had never been a habitual user of illegal substances and . maintained that she was now drug-free. US . border officers appear  to have hardened their  position since the . start of  January, when Miss Lawson was allowed to fly to New  York to . film an interview promoting the second series of The Taste USA. A . spokesman for the US embassy in London said: ‘There are several ways of . legally travelling into the United States and Miss Lawson has been . invited to come to the embassy and apply for a visa for travel to the . US. ‘We understand she has . professional requirements for US travel and these matters are generally . handled routinely and expeditiously.’ Miss Lawson’s spokesman declined to comment. Many British stars have fallen foul of America’s immigration regulations because of drug use, criminal convictions and reported assaults. Those who have been refused entry visas range from Boy George to Lily Allen, Pete Doherty to Amy Winehouse. However, there are lots of celebrities who have been welcomed into the States – despite well-recorded drug use and criminal records. Former Beatle Sir Paul McCartney admitted taking heroin once, along with cocaine cannabis and LSD but has several houses in the US including a ranch in Arizona (pictured after his arrest in Japan for possession of cannabis) Sir Paul McCartney has spoken openly about his once habitual drug use and until 1973 was repeatedly denied entry into the US. The former Beatle, 71, has admitted to taking heroin on one occasion, as well as cocaine, cannabis and LSD. In an interview in 2004, he said: ‘Just about everyone was doing them in one form or another. We were no different.’ Russel Brand has mad no secret of his past as a heroin addict, and owns a £2million house in LA . His drug use made headlines in 1980 when he was arrested at Tokyo airport with his band Wings after officials discovered half a pound of marijuana in his luggage. He spent ten nights in prison before eventually being deported. Despite this, Sir Paul has several houses in the US, including a Manhattan townhouse and a ranch in Arizona. Since marrying American heiress Nancy Shevell, he now spends a lot of time at their mansion in the exclusive Hamptons. Mick Jagger has also openly admitted taking cocaine, amphetamines and cannabis. In 1967, he and Rolling Stones bandmate Keith Richards were convicted for drug possession and jailed for three months – sentences later quashed on appeal. However, Jagger’s well-documented drug use does not appear to have been a bar to entry to the US. The band have toured there many times and Jagger, 70, spent a lot of time living in New York with his girlfriend L’Wren Scott, who committed suicide last month. Russell Brand is well-known for his heroin addiction and run-ins with the police, having been arrested 12 times. He quit drugs in 2003 and is now patron of addiction charity Focus 12. Despite his past record, however, the star has not been barred from America. He has appeared in a number of Hollywood films and owns a £2million home in LA. Welsh singer Katherine Jenkins, 33, admitted having been a regular user of cocaine and ecstasy but this has not led to a bar on her travel. She competed in the US television show Dancing With The Stars. Mick Jagger (left) has openly admitted taking cocaine, amphetamines and cannabis. He is pictured alongside bandmate Keith Richards after standing trial for drugs offences . Steve Coogan, too, has been open about his past drug use. In an interview in 2011, the comedian and actor, 48, said he started smoking cannabis when he was 22, which developed into a class-A habit. He works in the US regularly, having recently appeared in Oscar-nominated Philomena, and has been living there on and off for more than a decade. In 2007, Lily Allen’s US working visa was revoked after her arrest for assaulting a photographer in London. Amy Winehouse was denied a visa to enter America in 2008 because of her drug record. The singer had earlier been  arrested with her then husband for possession of cannabis. Noel and Liam Gallagher were forced to undergo drug tests before being granted US visas in 1997. The brothers, who were going to New York to promote an album, had been cautioned by British police for cocaine possession a year earlier.","TV chef barred from boarding a flight at Heathrow after her drug confession .

"Questions over Ed Miliband’s leadership were growing in the wake of the disastrous by-election result in Heywood, with MPs on all sides accusing him of being out of touch with working-class supporters. As Ukip came within a whisker of victory in one of Labour’s safest seats, his critics complained of policies ‘aimed at the latte-sipping, chino-wearing, light Green, inner-city left’ but ignoring the concerns of most voters. Senior MP Jack Straw even suggested his party leader’s ‘panda eyes and strange lips’ were putting voters off. Scroll down for video . Ed Miliband with Labour MP Liz McInnes who won a narrow victory in the Heywood and Middleton by-election . Ed Miliband celebrated Labour's victory in Heywood and Middleton in the greater Manchester constituency this morning . Mr Miliband said Labour's vote held up while the Conservative Party's collapsed. He said: 'The Tories are a party that cannot win a majority at the next general election' Former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said Labour leader Ed Miliband had 'panda eyes and strange lips' One MP said Mr Miliband faces a ‘bloodbath’ meeting with his party on Monday, with ‘furious’ backbenchers ready to tell him his complacent attitude is putting Labour heartlands at risk. Ukip made an extraordinary and unexpected advance in the Heywood and Middleton by-election, prompted by the death of veteran MP Jim Dobbin. Despite Labour going into the contest with a majority of 6,000, Ukip finished just 617 votes behind – after a partial recount. Yet incredibly, Mr Miliband insisted the result showed he was on course to win next year’s general election. Party strategists claimed a similar Ukip advance next year would hand all 14 marginal seats in the North West to Labour. At a ‘victory’ meeting in Heywood, Mr Miliband said: ‘The Tories are a party losing in their own backyard and retreating from what they used to call their own frontline.’ But senior figures accused the Labour leader of complacency over the potential threat. Ex-minister Frank Field said: ‘If last night’s vote heralds the start of Ukip’s serious assault into Labour’s neglected core vote, all bets are off for safer, let alone marginal seats at the next election.’ Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk warned: ‘We will not get elected on the basis of public sector workers, students, Guardian readers and the ethnic minority communities in the United Kingdom. We need a much broader appeal than that.’ Labour's relieved candidate Liz Mcinnes celebrates her victory after the count for the Heywood and Middleton by-election held at Heywood sports village in Greater Manchester . Ms Mcinnes scraped to victory by just 617 votes - almost losing the party's 6,000 majority to UKIP . The race for the Heywood and Middleton seat came down to the wire last night, amid a surge in support for UKIP . Former Cabinet minister Jack Straw was the most senior MP to raise doubts about Labour’s strategy, arguing its immigration message needed to be ‘stronger’. He said: ‘We could and should have done better.’ Addressing voters’ doubts about Mr Miliband, Mr Straw said he was a strong leader, but added: ‘I know people say he’s got panda eyes and strange lips – I could make the same remarks in different ways about Mr Clegg or Mr Cameron.’ Mr Miliband addressed Labour supporters and the media on the steps of Heywood Library today . John McTernan, a senior adviser to Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, said the Heywood result must put paid to Labour policies ‘aimed at the latte-sipping, chino-wearing, light Green, inner-city left’. ‘We are in deep, deep trouble,’ he added. ‘We are lost and our voters want us back. They keep sending us messages. When will we listen?’ He said the party had ‘lost the power of hearing’ by pretending voters were most concerned about the NHS, adding: ‘For voters, visitors and the casual observer it was a by-election about immigration. Even in politics a conversation isn’t simply waiting for your turn to speak – it has to be about engagement.’ Yvette Cooper, shadow home secretary, told Channel 4 News her party has ‘to talk about immigration’, adding: ‘We need much stronger action on employers who exploit immigration to undercut wages and jobs – and that’s something that comes up repeatedly on the doorstep.’ Labour MP John Mann said: ‘Ed Miliband needs to step up to the mark. Amongst Labour voters there is a huge frustration. 'But … this is much more than, “Do we like Ed Miliband? What does he look like on the telly?”. 'There’s a bigger issue: is Labour in touch with its core vote and with those people who voted Labour in 1997 but have abstained since? 'Because that’s a lot of the people who … have shifted to Ukip – those lost five million voters from 1997.’ But one senior Labour MP told Sky News: ‘Where our problem lies is leadership. Wherever you go you hear, “It’s your leader”.’ The MP said a meeting of Mr Miliband and his backbenchers on Monday ‘could be an absolute bloodbath’. A colleague said: ‘As a retail proposition Miliband is dreadful … even people who aren’t interested in politics have an opinion on him: he’s weird.’ Former leadership contender Diane Abbott said the working class in Labour areas is ‘increasingly alienated from the Labour Party’. She added: ‘But what the right forgets to mention is that this process began under their hero, Tony Blair …Whenever you mentioned core Labour voters you were dismissed. 'New Labour bigwigs insisted that those voters “had nowhere else to go”. Well now they are finding somewhere else to go: the SNP in Scotland, the Greens and Ukip.’ Paul Nuttall, Ukip’s deputy leader, said in an invitation to Labour MPs and councillors: ‘If you want to come and join what is now statistically the most working-class party … come over and join Ukip.’ By JAMES TOZER . Locals say Miliband's unannounced and brief visit to Haywood and Middleton had done nothing to ease the concerns of working class voters . Ed Miliband was under fire last night for failing to meet voters or answer questions from news-paper reporters. In a brief victory speech in the Heywood and Middleton constituency, Mr Miliband insisted he was listening to the concerns of ordinary people – but he then swept through a public library without speaking to anyone. And he ignored questions from reporters on how Liz McInnes won the Lancashire seat by just 617 votes. Aides awaiting his arrival had claimed he would be ‘too busy to give any interviews’. Only a handful of newspaper reporters were present among the television crews, with Labour officials giving little notice of Mr Miliband’s appearance. Flanked by around 30 hastily assembled supporters, he gave a three-and-a-half minute address claiming he was capable of leading the fight against the ‘disillusionment and despair’ that had cost all the main parties votes. Afterwards, bewildered locals said his fleeting and unannounced visit had done nothing to tackle Labour’s problem with working class voters. ‘He seems like a bit of a coward to come all the way up here but then not meet ordinary people,’ one disgruntled constituent said. Retired businesswoman Anne Haworth, 67, who was in the library at the time, said she had not been impressed by Mr Miliband’s personal manner. ‘He just swept through without even looking at anybody on the way past,’ the grandmother of three added. ‘He doesn’t really help himself.’","Labour MP Liz McInnes wins in Heywood and Middleton in narrow victory .

"Grave charges: Laurel Schlemmer, 40, has been charged with homicide after telling police that 'crazy voices' told her to drown her two sons in the bath . The pastor of a Pennsylvania mother accused of drowning her youngest son and critically injuring his brother backed into the boys with her van 10 months ago, but everyone thought at the time that it was just an accident. Laurel Schlemmer, 40, of McCandless, is being held without bond after she was arraigned early Wednesday on charges including criminal homicide, aggravated assault and child endangerment. Schlemmer told Allegheny County detectives she heard 'crazy voices' telling her to . push her sons underwater before she sat on the boys in the bathtub, . drowning 3-year-old Luke and leaving 6-year-old Daniel in . critical condition. Allegheny County district attorney's spokesman Mike Manko announced Thursday afternoon that Daniel has no brain activity and is on life support. The injured boy's status first emerged during a bond hearing Thursday for Schlemmer. The woman didn't speak during the short video conference. Her attorney, Michael Machen, declined to comment after the hearing. Schlemmer is in jail and on suicide watch. Her attorney got permission to have her evaluated by a psychiatrist. The deadly incident comes less than a year after Schlemmer was questioned for nearly running over the two boys. She was never charged. North Park Church Pastor Dan Hendley said that the van incident happened in the driveway of the boys' grandparents in a town near McCandless, where Schlemmer had been living with her sons. ‘There was no concern that there was anything but a terrible accident that occurred in that situation,’ Hendley said. Scroll down for video . Family tragedy: Mrs Schlemmer confessed that she told her two younger sons, three-year-old Luke (far left) and six-year-old Daniel (far right) to get in the tub and then sat on them, believing she could be a better mother to her older son (center) with them gone . Tight-knit community: The deadly drowning took place in the Schlemmers' home in the 900 block of Saratoga Drive in upscale bedroom community of McCandless, Pennsylvania . Hendley said the family seemed to have . bounced back well from the van accident, which he said caused internal . injuries to Daniel and left Luke unable to walk for a time. ‘They seemed to be doing well from the distance from which I observed them,’ he said. The . pastor said there were concerns about Schlemmer's mental state as a . result of that trauma, not because her friends or family had any . suspicions about the van incident. ‘What was shared with me is she was in . the van and the boys were behind her and she didn't see them,’ he said. ‘She thought the boys had run inside and, instead, they were in back of . the van.’ Schlemmer also received a citation for leaving a toddler unattended in a parked car September 5, 2009, in nearby Ross Township. Court . records don't indicate which child was in the car, but police said the . car's interior was 112 degrees when officers arrived. The child wasn't . injured and Schlemmer paid a small fine, according to court papers. Memorial: A stuffed leopard sits next to a votive candle  Wednesday along a walkway outside the home in McCandless, Pa., where two children were found unresponsive in a bathtub Tuesday . Tragedy struck Tuesday morning after Mrs Schlemmer's 7-year-old son left . for school. She put the . older boy on the bus at around 8.40am, then told the younger boys to . take off their pajamas and get into the bathtub. 'Schlemmer . said after the boys got into the tub she got into the tub ""fully . clothed"" and ""crazy voices"" were telling her to push the boys down into . the water,' the complaint said. 'Schlemmer explained that at one point she [was] sitting on top of boys while they were under the water in the tub.'. Red flags: Mrs Schlemmer was suspected of trying to back over her children with her car last year, and in 2009, she was cited for leaving one of her kids in a hot car unattended . The . detectives said Schlemmer went on to say that she 'thought she could be . a better mother' to the oldest boy 'if the other two boys weren't . around and they would be better off in heaven.' Schlemmer . pulled both unconscious boys out of the tub and laid them on the . bathroom floor while she called 911. She told police she never attempted . CPR because she did not know how to do it . Paramedics who responded to the colonial home in the 900 block of Saratoga Drive rushed Luke and Daniel Schlemmer to UPMC Passavant Hospital, where the younger boy was pronounced dead at around 10.50am. His brother . was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit at Children's . Hospital of Pittsburgh at UPMC, where police said he remained in . critical condition. On a 911 call placed just minutes after Schlemmer had . allegedly drowned her children, the mother sounded halting but calm and extremely . polite, reported the Pittsburgh Post--Gazette. 'Um, my two sons,’ Schlemmer said, ‘I think that they’ve, they’ve drowned in our bathtub.’ During the five-minute conversation with the dispatcher, Schlemmer explained that she let her sons to play in the bathtub while she went to the restroom, and by the time she returned to check on them, both children were unconscious. Later, the operator asked if the boys had anything in their mouths. 'Just water,' the mother replied. Spiritual adviser: Pastor Dan Hendley (left), who has known the Schlemmers for years, said the family appeared to be doing very well since last year's incident when the mother backed over her sons with her van . 'Happy' couple: Mrs Schlemmer worked as a teacher until 2004, while her husband of nine years, Mark, is an actuary; the couple have been very active in their church and have been described as 'strong Christians' Word that the two little boys were found unresponsive stunned neighbors in the quiet, upscale bedroom community a few miles north of Pittsburgh. They described the family as religious and said Schlemmer was a stay-at-home mom whose husband, 43-year-old Mark Schlemmer, was working at the time. According to Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, the couple got married in 2005. Mr Schlemmer is employed as an actuary, while his wife worked as a teacher at Kerr Elementary School and Dorseyville Middle School in the Fox Chapel School District from 1999 until 2004. The Schlemmers have been long-time members of the North Park Church congregation, where the wife had been attending Bible studies since her 20s. ‘They were a wonderful couple, strong Christians,’ Rev. Bob Shull, a former associate pastor at the church who officiated the Schlemmers’ wedding ceremony in 2005, told Pittsburgh Tribune Review. Two bouquets of flowers were tucked Wednesday into a bush at the front of the family's home on a winding street of tidy split-level houses and manicured yards. Mourners also left a small stuffed leopard and a burning votive candle. Exemplary family: Neighbors described  the Schlemmers as religious and the wife was a stay-at-home mother . Schlemmer . faces a preliminary hearing April 11. Other charges against her include . reckless endangerment, aggravated assault and tampering with physical . evidence, for allegedly hiding her wet clothes in a trash bag and then . hiding that bag under three other bags. Pastor . Hendley and other friends at the evangelical Presbyterian congregation . were working to help Mark Schlemmer, who is currently staying with a friend. The pastor said the husband was distraught but what happened, but not hostile toward his wife. ‘I'd question whether they're ever going to go back to that house given what's occurred,’ Hendley said.","Laurel Schlemmer, 40, said she wanted to drown her youngest children, ages three and six, so she could be a better mother to her 7-year-old son .

"Natasha Hugh has been jailed after lavishing £40,000 of her boxer husband's ill-gotten gains on a luxury wedding and dream honeymoon . A 'gangster's moll' has been jailed after lavishing £40,000 of her boxer husband's ill-gotten gains on a luxury wedding and dream honeymoon. Natasha Hugh, 27, splashed out on an opulent wedding to  former heavyweight champion boxer turned international cocaine dealer Justyn Hugh, in Cardiff. A court heard beautician Hugh paid out for a luxury ceremony including chocolate fountains and casino tables and was seen paying a hairdresser from a 'blue gym bag' stuffed with bank notes. The mother-of-two and her drug dealing husband then flew off on a dream honeymoon to Barbados. Her extravagant lifestyle came to an end when 29-year-old former Welsh light-heavyweight champion boxer Justyn Hugh was jailed for running an international cocaine ring. Hugh was found guilty of eight charges of laundering nearly £70,000 of her husband's £500,000 drug operation. Prosecutor Roger Griffiths said: 'There was a lavish lifestyle which wasn't sustainable on the declared earnings of Mr and Mrs Hugh. 'The majority of transactions were dealt with in cash instalments. 'Mrs Hugh knew or should have known the money had come from crime.' Hugh splashed thousands of pounds in her home town of Newport, South Wales, during a four year spending spree. A court heard she had a £10,477 wedding at the Vale Resort - a luxury four star golf, spa and leisure hotel near Cardiff. Hugh spent £2,260 on dental work and £2,435 on bridal wear and accessories ahead of her plush ceremony. Hugh also paid for the £3,900 holiday to Barbados using cash, staying at the Almond Causarina hotel on the Caribbean island. Hugh (left) , 27, splashed out on an opulent wedding to former heavyweight champion boxer turned international cocaine dealer Justyn Hugh (right. She also splurged on dental work and salon equipment . She bought a Mini Sytner with almost £5,000 paid in cash - she later exchanged the car for a £19,570 Mini Countryman. She spent £4,000 on hairdressing equipment for a beauty salon she set up called Glamorous U. Cardiff Crown Court heard how she also spent £13,000 putting her child in nursery. Hugh claimed her husband had a 'controlling and violent nature'. She wept in the dock as Judge Stephen Hopkins QC jailed her for 18 months and told her: 'To adopt the expression - you were willing to become a gangster's moll. 'I do not accept you were genuinely remorseful, just sorry you were caught. The court heard she spent £4,000 on hairdressing equipment for a beauty salon she set up called Glamorous U . 'It was pure greed and you were willing to tolerate your husband's behaviour because of the financial benefits of his drug dealing activities. 'After a time you knew exactly what he was doing and exactly where his money was coming from.' Welsh light-heavyweight champion Hugh was jailed for 11 years earlier this year after running a £500,000 drugs operation which had links to Albania and the Netherlands.","Natasha Hugh splashed out on wedding to cocaine dealer Justyn Hugh .

"As controversial weapons in the war on terror, they are regularly heard in the skies over countries such as Afghanistan and Somalia. But drones are also a feature of the daily lives of a tiny community far removed from the world’s most notorious troublespots. For the noise of the unmanned aircraft fills the air over Aberporth, a once-bustling fishing port nestling beneath cliffs in West Wales. Sky spy: A Watchkeeper surveillance drone is put through its paces above Aberporth . The seaside town is the unlikely home to what is billed as Britain’s ‘drone centre of excellence’. The local airport, a former Second World War RAF station which is now privately owned, is the only place in the UK where military and civilian unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be tested. It is surrounded by 500 square miles of restricted airspace, meaning the pilotless drones – used to carry out surveillance and deliver missile attacks without the need to put servicemen’s lives in danger – can be flown without the risk of colliding with other aircraft. However, the decision to turn West Wales Airport into the National Aeronautical Centre and spend £21million of taxpayers’ money on a neighbouring technology park has shattered the peace of Aberporth in more ways than one. Some critics have ethical concerns about using drones as remote battlefield weapons, saying that, particularly when used by US forces, they have been responsible for civilian deaths. Unlikely droning test site: Aberporth in West Wales was a quiet seaside village before the drones started flying overhead in Cardigan Bay . Others say money has been wasted on a project which has yet to deliver the jobs that were promised. The Welsh Government said Parc Aberporth would create 1,000 jobs but the half-deserted site employs fewer than 40 people, while up to 12 more work at the airport. Protesters also complain about noise, privacy and safety – two test drones have crashed. The state-of-the-art Watchkeeper UAV, which cost £889million, is being put through its paces by the Royal Artillery. Fifty-four of the drones, which resemble giant grey cigars with wings, are destined for surveillance work in Afghanistan. The craft send images back to a control centre using cameras so sensitive they are capable of reading a playing card from 1,000ft. Commanders say they allow Taliban operations to be spotted, saving the lives of frontline troops. The Ministry of Defence says Watchkeeper will not be armed, unlike the Reaper drones operated by the RAF above Helmand, but it is capable of pinpointing enemy targets for missile strikes. Watchkeepers take off and land at Aberporth up to 25 times a day. The drones described by locals as  ‘flying lawnmowers’ are audible even after they disappear from view. Eirian James, an opera singer who lives near the end of the runway, said: ‘The noise of the drones is highly disturbing, sinister. It makes me think of those poor people who hear the whirring and they don’t know if it’s the last sound they hear before being blown to bits.’ War on terror: unmanned drones have become a controversial feature of modern warfare, commonly used in countries such as Afghanistan and Pakistan for surveillance and missile attacks . Des Davies, 68, a retired stockbroker, said: ‘They wanted a Silicon Valley-style hub for the UAV industry. They got a white elephant. It has been a scandalous waste of money. It would have been better if they’d given 40 people half a million each to start a local business.’ Mark Williams, Liberal Democrat MP for Ceredigion, said: ‘There was always concern about the ethical dimension, the potential intrusion of surveillance, safety and the noise nuisance. But the community gave people the benefit of the doubt. ‘Many promises were made and these have been in the pipeline for a very long time. Despite a lot of public money being spent, there is not much evidence of economic development on the ground.’","Controversial drones testing has been ruining the peace of a quiet seaside town in West Wales .

"Jilted: Steve Froggatt, 58, told police he 'necked' the bird after letting himself in using a spare key . A jilted lover threw eggs at his former girlfriend’s house before tearing the head off her pet parrot in revenge for dumping him, a court has heard. Steve Froggatt, 58, of Preston, Lancashire, who targeted Pauline Woodfine’s house after the pair had separated, told police he ‘necked’ the bird after letting himself in using a spare key. Miss Woodfine, who has recently been treated for cancer, returned home from a night out to find African Grey parrot Deano’s cage empty and his feathers all over the floor. When she confronted Froggatt with a text saying: ‘Why have you killed my bird?’, she claims he simply replied: ‘You killed me.’ Froggatt reportedly admitted pulling the head off the parrot to police because it was ‘annoying’, but Deano’s body has never been found. Froggatt had let himself into the property by using a spare key he had been given so he could collect his possessions after the woman, a retired nurse, called time on the relationship. Police had been called to domestic incidents at the couple’s home several times but no charges were pressed. Former brewery worker Froggatt has pleaded guilty to two counts of criminal damage relating to Deano and damaging brickwork at her home. He was remanded in custody and is next due to appear at Preston Magistrates’ Court on October 7.

"A major British defence company is supplying the deadly US drone programme, which has killed scores of civilians, leading critics to condemn the UK as complicit in ‘war crimes’. The firm, Cobham plc – which specialises in defence and communications electronics, including satellites – manufactures antennas for armed Predator drones used to launch fearsome weapons on to targets. The Mail on Sunday can reveal that the Government has approved a series of controversial export licences for the firm, showing that Ministers are officially sanctioning the controversial US drones war. Scroll down for video . Question marks: A UK defence firm has been given licences to supply parts for armed U.S. drones such as this Predator model . Under scrutiny: Dorset-based firm Cobhams plc boasts on its website of its work with the Predator . The unmanned Predator, armed with Hellfire missiles or guided bombs and with a top speed of 135mph, has been used to find and kill Al Qaeda leaders and terrorists in a series of covert missions in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Africa. Human rights groups say that the drone attacks violate international law and kill civilians. British companies supplying military equipment to other countries must seek approval for contracts from the Government. Last year another British company, GE Intelligent Platforms, pulled out of supplying the Predator programme following an outcry. But according to a document seen by The Mail on Sunday, the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) granted Cobham 31 drone export licences between 2008 and 2012. Many of the parts covered by the licences will end up being used in drones, including the Predator and Reaper. In its literature, Cobham boasts of its work with the Predator. It says: ‘Cobham’s communications antennas, radar components and sub-systems play important roles in modern UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles], including the General Atomics Predator family of drones.' Deadly: The Reaper (pictured) and Predator drones are responsible for thousands of civilians deaths and human rights groups say  the attacks violate international law . Last night human rights group Reprieve called on the Government to review its policy on granting the licences. Reprieve lawyer Catherine Gilfelder said: ‘US drones hover over towns in non-war zones 24 hours a day, seven days a week, terrorising communities and indiscriminately killing, in violation of international law. ‘The manufacture of components for Predators on British soil further implicates this country in these gross human rights violations. ‘The Government, by condoning the export of these components, is demonstrating a complete lack of concern for those affected by drones and for the UK’s reputation. Export controls urgently need to be tightened in order to end our complicity in this unlawful programme.’ John Hemming MP, a Liberal Democrat member of the all-party committee on drones, said: ‘The UK needs to stop facing both ways on armed drones. They may be efficient and cost effective tools for extra-judicial executions, but they don’t deliver peace.’ And Rehman Chishti, Conservative MP for Gillingham and Rainham, said: ‘It has previously been alleged that the Government has supported the American drone  programme through providing  locational intelligence and both of these issues raise serious questions about whether the Government has acted in accordance with international law.’ Foreign Secretary William Hague has said that the UK supports the use of armed drones only in Afghanistan where the UN has authorised military action. But the US military also operates armed drones in Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen, where innocent civilians have been killed in attacks on suspected terrorists. The Department for Business Innovation and Skills has refused to disclose details of licences on grounds of commercial confidentiality. A  spokesman said that human rights issues were properly considered in all export licence decisions. A spokesman for Cobham, which is based in Dorset, confirmed it supplied antennas ‘to numerous unmanned systems including the US Predator, specifically via our facility in Texas.’","Defence firm Cobham plc supplies parts for deadly U.S. drones .

"An RAF base in Britain is being used by America in its controversial drone warfare campaign, it was claimed last night. Documents seen by The Mail on Sunday reveal that the United States has established a drone ‘operations centre’ in the heart of the Lincolnshire countryside which could be used to co-ordinate attacks in the Middle East and Africa. Last night, the revelation sparked claims of British complicity in the US Airforce (USAF) assassination programme which is being investigated by the United Nations. Deadly: An RAF base in Britain is being used by America in its drone warfare campaign. One document requests US security-cleared staff to work at RAF Waddington on this drone, the Predator, which has killed scores of militant suspects (Artists impression) One document requests US . security-cleared staff to work at RAF Waddington on a USAF drone called . the Predator. The weapon has killed hundreds of people in Pakistan, . Somalia and Yemen. A second . document describes a role for a communications technician at the same . base ‘supporting 24/7 operations of critical real-time USAF/ANG [Air . National Guard] mission operations’. Bosh . Global Services, the US company recruiting personnel, designs and . maintains key drone equipment for the American military and has . established a base in Lincolnshire, believed to be at RAF Waddington. The site has been designated Britain’s first drone centre and will have five fully armed Reapers from next year. Data War: How the super-fast telecommunications link between Britain and the Pentagon drone base Djibouti in East Africa works . Politicians and human rights groups have demanded to know the extent of America’s use of British bases to  support its operations. Clive Stafford Smith, the head of legal charity Reprieve, said: ‘The US drones programme operates from secret bases without regard to law. ‘The evidence that UK bases, subject to RAF oversight, are supporting US drones appears to implicate the UK in terrorisation and destruction.’ Professor Noel Sharkey, of the University of Sheffield and Britain’s foremost expert on drones, said the documents demanded an explanation from the UK and US military. Control: A United States Airman operates a sensor control station for an unmanned Reaper weapon (file picture) He said: ‘It is very important the British public know what foreign strikes are being delivered from UK soil. 'Current operation of the US Predator drones in Iraq, Afghanistan and Africa is conducted from the US, which requires a communications link between the US base station and Europe and can cause control delays. 'These delays could be minimised by controlling the Predators from the UK, which has excellent satellite coverage of all of the conflict zones.’ Complicit: Royal Air Force Waddington in Lincolnshire could be helping in the control of the unmanned drones . Baroness Sarah Ludford, the Liberal  Democrat MEP for London, said: ‘Assassinations even of suspected terrorists outside a recognised framework of war breach long-established norms of international law. 'Not only must Britain refuse to co-operate with illegal targeted killings, it must publicly  challenge American attempts to move the legal goalposts.’ The wider claim of UK complicity in US drone missions is supported by evidence of a deal between the US military and British Telecom. It has been paid by Washington to link a second RAF base to the Pentagon’s drone headquarters in Djibouti, East Africa. Redacted documents seen by The Mail on Sunday show that the US-run former bomber station at RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire has been fitted with equipment capable of supplying secret data to the drone centre in Africa where American unmanned aircraft have killed scores of civilians and extremist militant suspects. The BT document, obtained under America’s Freedom of Information laws, is a contract with the US military for a link which can  provide a secure route for passing intelligence between the two bases. Catherine Gilfedder, a lawyer for Reprieve, which obtained the contract, said: ‘In facilitating communications between US forces in  the UK and Djibouti, BT is profiting from  this campaign of death.’ The contract, which names Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti and RAF Croughton, specifies that the communications link must avoid any connections to Iran, Syria and Saudi Arabia. In a letter, Mr Stafford Smith asked the telecoms giant to explain why it was supporting the drone programme. Contract: The US-run former bomber station at RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire has a communications link to a drone centre in Africa . Last night, the company said: ‘BT provides telephony and communications which link up governments and organisations all over the world. ‘Whether it’s a government organisation, bank or manufacturing firm their work is confidential.’ A US Embassy spokeswoman said that it did not discuss communications infrastructure linked to its military bases. The Ministry of Defence added: ‘There are no circumstances under which UK military assets, including bases made available to the US, could be used by the US without the agreement of the Government.’ Link: Documents have shown that RAF Croughton has been fitted with equipment capable of supplying data to the Pentagon drone base Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti, East Africa .","Drone operations centre could be used for attacks in Middle East and Africa .

"Islamic extremists in Syria and Iraq could be defeated within six months if Britain and America sent in ground troop, ex-army chief Lord Richards has claimed. The former head of the Armed Forces said it was 'naïve' to think ISIS could be overcome without 'boots on the ground' and greater involvement by western armies. David Cameron has ruled out using ground troops in the conflict, as ministers stepped up calls for Turkey to step in to defeat forces threatening a key town close to their border with Syria. Scroll down for video . Former Army chief Lord Richards said it was 'naive' to think ISIS could be defeated without greater involvement by western forces . There has been growing frustration among members of the US-led coalition being assembled against IS at the reluctance of Turkey to intervene, despite having forces positioned on the border. But Lord Richards said western troops would need to be sent in to tackle the threat posed by ISIS. He told Huffington Post: 'If western boots were on the ground, if western armies were to be applied to the problem [of Islamic State], it could be over in six months.' He stressed that British soldiers being sent in was 'not going to happen, clearly' but he said the option should remain on the table. 'The idea that you can make [the Free Syrian Army or the Peshmerga] successful in the time we have available to us... without much more active and fulsome western involvement is, I think, naive.' Defence Secretary Michael Fallon today called on Turkey to do more to tackle the threat from Islamic extremists on its border with Syria . The British government has insisted that the response to the rise of ISIS must involve an international coalition, including countries from the region. There are growing fears that the lightly armed Kurdish defenders in Kobani - just inside Syria - could be overrun by ISIS fighters. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon today urged the Turkish government to become more involved. 'Turkey certainly could help. It is a matter for Turkey, but other allies in the region have been helping,' he told the BBC Radio 4 today programme. 'This is a situation that can only be resolved, not just by America and Britain, but by the region itself so we'd certainly like to see Turkey more involved but in the end it is a decision for their government.' Turkish tanks secure their border area as airstrikes are carried out by an alleged alliance war plane on Islamic State targets in the west of Kobane, Syria . Mr Fallon warned that if ISIS - also referred to as Isil (Islamic State in Syria and the Levant) and Islamic State - was not stopped, it would have severe consequences for the entire region. 'Clearly every country in the region has got to see now what it can do to contribute to dealing with Isil otherwise we will have Iraq falling apart and Syria falling apart and that is a danger to the entire region,' he said. Last month the House of Commons voted in favour of air strikes, but only in Iraq. Today Mr Fallon made clear that ministers do not believe that Parliament is ready to authorise the extension of military action into Syria. 'We don't have authority from Parliament to operate in Syria at the moment. 'Our judgment at the moment is that Parliament wouldn't give us that authority,' he said.","Former Chief of the Defence Staff says western countries must step up .

"A former Centrelink telephone operator claims he became so distressed taking calls from desperate welfare claimants that he now suffers from ‘telephone phobia’ and is unable to earn a living. Mark Grant has lost his legal bid for workers’ compensation, after claiming he developed his intense fear due to the ‘despair’ he faced, taking 60 calls a day 'that pulled at his heartstrings'. Mr Grant, now a taxi driver, worked in the role for the Department of Human Services for six months in 2008 and says the illness arises from ‘the taking of telephone calls, fear or what/who the next call might be.’ Mark Grant (not pictured) has lost his legal bid for workers’ compensation, after claiming he developed his intense fear due to the ‘despair’ he faced, taking 60 calls a day 'that pulled at his heartstrings'. He believes the phobia was triggered by ‘so many people living in despair; so many people ripping off the system, the system being unfair/rigid’. The taxi driver told the tribunal that stressful aspects of the role included: . 'Young people who were unable to get jobs pulled at my heart strings, people would say they are unable to pay the rent, let alone pay to travel to a job interview,' 'People who were relying on the generosity of friends.’ Mr Grant insists that the telephone phobia occurred as a result of his role as a telephone operator. ‘If I had had a telephone phobia prior to commencing at Centrelink, it would have made no sense for me to have taken a job as a call centre operator,’ Mr Grant said, according to court documents. Mr Grant, now a taxi driver, worked in the role for the Department of Human Services for six months in 2008 and says the illness arises from ‘the taking of telephone calls, fear or what/who the next call might be.’ Mr Grant also claims that he suffered when he was subjected to aggressive phone calls – yet tribunal member Naida Isenberg confirms there is no evidence Mr Grant made any complaints about specific incidents of threat or abuse. However, three medical experts ruled Mr Grant's condition was directly related to the failure of his mortgage broking business, which Mr Grant was running whilst working at Centrelink. Mr Grant's mortgage broking business, which employed up to ten people, went into liquidation in July 2009. He was working at Centrelink in 2008 from May to November. Mr Grant took the matter to a tribunal after unsuccessfully lodging a Disability Support Pension claim with Centrelink and a workers' compensation claim with Comcare. Mr Grant lodged an unsuccessful workers' compensation claim with federal workplace insurer Comcare in May 2013, more than four years after ceasing employment at Centrelink. When his business went into liquidation, Mr Grant was forced to live off his income protection insurance. When the funds ran out he made an unsuccessful Disability Support Pension claim with his former employer, Centrelink. Following a trail of unsuccessful claims, Mr Grant pursued his tribunal hearing. Tribunal member Naida Isenberg ruled that Mr Grant's condition was not a result of his employment at Centrelink 'at all', therefore he is not eligible for benefits from Comcare. Tribunal member Ms Isenberg ruled that Mr Grant's condition was not a result of his employment at Centrelink 'at all', therefore he is not eligible for benefits from Comcare. 'The medical evidence... does not attribute the applicant’s psychological condition to his Centrelink workplace at all, let alone to a 'significant degree'', said Ms Isenberg. Mr Grant is now working as a taxi driver and is not required to take phone calls, relying on the network computer.

"Grandmother-of-four Norina Spencer, 65, died of lung cancer two years after doctors failed to spot the mass in a chest X-ray . A grandmother died from lung cancer after doctors failed to spot it on an X-ray two years before she was diagnosed. Norina Spencer, 65, went to hospital in July 2011 for a double knee replacement due to rheumatoid arthritis but because she complained of pains in her chest, staff also carried out X-rays. Mrs Spencer was told by staff at Grimsby Hospital, North East Lincolnshire, that her lungs were clear - but tests almost two years later revealed she was suffering from lung cancer. The cancer, which was visible in the original X-ray, had spread to her spine and she died in July last year. Her husband of 47 years Derek, from Scunthorpe, North Lincolnshire, instructed specialist medical negligence lawyers to investigate her care. Mr Spencer, who has four sons and four grandchildren, said: 'The past year has been so difficult. We were distraught when we found out that Norina had lung cancer and were so shocked and upset when we found out it should have been diagnosed two years before she died. 'You put your trust in doctors to find out what is wrong and provide treatment to the best of their ability but Norina was sadly let down. The worst thing for us is that they did the necessary tests but failed to analyse them properly allowing her cancer to spread.' He added: 'She was very strong willed and refused to be beaten by the cancer even though deep-down we knew it was terminal. 'Three of our sons live in Australia and flew back to see her in the final months and we have all been left devastated by our loss. 'Nothing can bring her back to us but we wanted answers as to how this could happen and hopefully through taking legal action it will make people sit up and take notice and make sure that changes are made to stop this from happening again. 'I would hate for others to go through what we have.' The hospital also carried out its own Serious Untoward Incident investigation which revealed that staff had made errors with her diagnosis. The report, by Northern Lincolnshire and Goole Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, made several recommendations of actions that should be taken to improve care and patient safety. It revealed that had the lung cancer been spotted in 2011, she would have undergone treatment and it would most likely have not spread to her spine. Mrs Spencer had gone to Grimsby Hospital for knee replacement surgery in 2011 but after she complained of pains in her chest, doctors carried out the X-ray - but failed to spot the cancerous mass . The NHS Trust has now admitted that it failed to spot and diagnose her cancerous mass in 2011 and apologised for the errors in Mrs Spencer's care in a letter to lawyers. Zoe Brodrick, representing the family, said: 'This is an extremely tragic case as it is clear from the evidence that had the mass been identified on the original X-rays, Mrs Spencer could have received appropriate treatment for her cancer and it may not have then spread to her spine which ultimately led to her death. 'The family were naturally devastated by her death and the circumstances surrounding the spread of her illness and wanted answers as to how this situation could happen. 'There are serious patient safety issues involved in this case and the family wants assurances that the recommendations in the Serious Untoward Incident report have been fully carried out to prevent others from suffering in future. It is vital that the NHS Trust learns lessons from this case.' Norina Spencer with husband of 47 years Derek. He said: 'I would hate for others to go through what we have' Between the original x-rays in July 2011 and throughout 2012, Mrs Spencer had returned to hospital for follow up treatment for her knees and although she had no further chest pain, she did complain of fatigue. She was given steroids and advised that the tiredness was caused by her arthritis. On 21 April 2013 Mrs Spencer was referred from Accident and Emergency for a chest X-ray due to a suspected infection and further investigations discovered a large mass on the left side of her chest. A scan identified cancer in the lung which had spread to her spine. It was then that the original X-ray on 19 July 2011 was revisited and the cancerous mass clearly noticeable. Mrs Spencer underwent radiotherapy but died in July last year - two years after being told there was nothing to worry about on her lungs. Family doctors are failing to spot lung cancer until it is too late - with a third of patients diagnosed with the condition just 90 days before death. And for one in 20 people with lung cancer, researchers discovered the disease is discovered only after they have died. Even when patients had visited their GP repeatedly in the months before their death, lung cancer had often gone unnoticed. GPs are often confusing the signs of cancer with things like a smoker’s cough and failing to commission an X-ray. More than 35,000 people die of lung cancer in Britain each year, with just nine per cent surviving for more than five years with the disease. Respiratory physician Dr Emma O’Dowd found that those who died within three months had seen their GP an average five times before they finally received a diagnosis. Her team at Nottingham analysed a sample 20,140 cases of lung cancer seen at 440 GP surgeries between 2000 and 2013. Their research, published in the BMJ journal Thorax, established that 30 per cent of lung cancer patients died within three months of a diagnosis. She said: ‘Lung cancer can be difficult for doctors to distinguish from other lung diseases so we need to give them some tools that will help identify a patient as high risk. ‘If we can diagnose patients at an earlier stage hopefully they can get curable treatment rather than palliative treatment which is what most patients are getting at the moment. ‘It’s not that we’re trying to blame the GPs but if we have tools to identify these high risk people earlier than we should put them to use.’","Norina Spencer, 65, went to hospital in 2011 for knee replacement surgery .

"A young Australian working as a combat medic for a terror group in Syria says he is still a 'true blue Aussie' despite condoning the brutal beheadings by ISIS. Speaking in a thick Australian accent Abu Ousama says he is missing home comforts like Coco Pops and says 'home is home', everybody is going to love their country'. Ousama is living among rebel fighters for Jund al-Aqsa and is one of the 100 Australians who have crossed over into Syria since the conflict began. Since the airing of the unverified footage Tony Abbott's office has referred the footage to Australian intelligence agencies, reports the Sydney Morning Herald. Scroll down for video . Speaking in a thick Australian accent Abu Ousama says he condones the beheadings by terror group ISIS . Ousama is living among rebel fighters and working as a medic for Jund al-Aqsa, a group affiliated with ISIS . He says there is no difference between a missile killing 15 people and one man getting his throat cut . Australian jihadist Ousama spoke candidly to a British photojournalist about his experience in Syria . Tam Hussain spoke to Abu Ousama when he was living in a city north of Hama . He took part in the interview broadcast on 7News by British photojournalist Tam Hussain who lived with the 1000 strong Islamic battalion group that is independent of ISIS but supports their ideology. Ousama, who didn't say where he was from in Australia, told 7News: 'You have these beheadings and some people might call them barbaric, some people might have these names for them but what is the difference between a missile that hits into a house which kills 15 kids compared to a man dying getting cut by his throat.' He says the brutality of ISIS is a necessary part of establishing an Islamic State. 'ISIS have taken this role of protecting the innocent Muslims of this country, of this land. 'So, they have to do what they need to do to make their state. 'If they're blackmailing America or anybody saying don't shoot a missile which is going to kill 50 or 60 people for one bloke how can we even say that's equivalent to it being a wrong?' When Ousama is not fighting he works as a medic in a local hospital and he wants the Australian public to know that he would not pose a risk if he returned home. British photojournalist Tam Hussain spent weeks living and interviewing the Islamic terror group . Hussain was treated like a member of the group in northern Syria for his time spent with the group . Ousama says that ISIS have taken on its role to protect 'innocent Muslims' ISIS fighters now have strongholds in Iraq and Syria . Islamic State terrorists have raised the black flag of Jihad in Kobane, Kurdish forces have been trying to resist this for weeks . 'There is no hatred between me and Australia. Actually home is home, everybody is going to love their country,' he said. The young Aussie also reveals that there are no home comforts living in Syria and he has to pay 500 Syrian for a box of Coco Pops. 'Just because you miss home you feel like some Coco Pops,' he told 7News. Despite his positive memories about Australia he does not rule out fighting against troops who might invade. 'If they are going to come in with their aeroplanes and shoot missiles and kill innocents etc etc then how can anybody, you're forced to. 'I hope that Allah accepts the good we've done and blesses us with his reward if the highest paradise. This is the best. What more could you want, you know? 'I'm sad to see Australia taking that step to come into a place it doesn't need to be because it will cause a reaction, it will cause people to hate it,' he told 7News. Ousama says the brutal beheading of James Foley was 'necessary' for ISIS to develop the Islamic State . Despite his views Ousama says he does not hate his home country but is not scared to die in Syria . Living in Syria means this young Australian is missing home comforts like Coco Pops . A member loyal to ISIS raises the black flag of Jihad in Raqqa in June this year . Julie Bishop says she is 'appalled' at the statements from Ousama. Ms Bishop said intelligence agencies would look closely at the Seven Network video. Speaking in Hobart on Saturday, Ms Bishop said it was 'unfathomable' why Australians would want to take up arms and fight in a conflict on the side of an organisation that exults in beheadings and executions. 'I'm appalled by it,' she said. 'It's unthinkable that someone would believe that beheadings are part of a legitimate territorial aspiration. These are murderous cults and they are using Islam to cover up for their violent behaviour. 'This (footage) goes to demonstrate why we're so determined to prevent foreign fighters from Australia taking up arms with terrorist organisations such as ISIL in Iraq and Syria. 'In my mind we need to do all we can to work with communities within Australia, the communities from where these people are coming, so that we can convince them that taking up with terrorist organisations is not only unlawful but it cannot be in their interests.' It is against the law in Australian to fight with a terrorist organisation or support a terrorist organisation, with penalties of to 25 years imprisonment, Ms Bishop said. Ousama said he wanted Australians to believe he would pose no risk if he returned to Australia but said he was not afraid to die in Syria.","Abu Ousama says he is a 'true blue Aussie' despite condoning fighting in Syria .

"A teacher who had sex with a 14-year-old boy on multiple occasions ten years ago has won her appeal to cut her probation short. In a ruling from the Supreme Court of Florida on Thursday, Debra Lafave had the 2013 ruling to reinstate her sex offender probation quashed. She remains on probation until her case can be heard by a trial judge. Lafave, 34, pleaded guilty in 2005 to a string of sexual encounters with the teenage boy who was a student where she taught English at Greco Middle School in Temple Terrace, Florida. Scroll down for video . Former Florida teacher Debra LaFave (pictured during a court appearance in 2006) pleaded guilty in 2005 to having sex with a 14-year-old student won her appeal today to have her probation cut short . Lafave's crimes drew national attention after provocative images taken of her before her teaching days, like this one, were released . She was put on house arrest for three years and then placed on probation for seven years. But the punishment was frozen by a retiring judge to allow her to help care for her newborn twin sons as well as her cancer-stricken mother in 2011. Lafave said at the time: 'My mom was diagnosed with cancer for the second time, and I spent my year off probation taking care of her and I'm so fortunate that I was able to take her to chemo treatments and spend the nights with her when she needed me the most. In 2013, Lafave was officially back on probation after protests from the victim's family. She was put back under federal supervision to see out the remaining four years and two months of her sentence. In 2005, Lafave, then 25, was convicted of two counts of lewd and lascivious battery, barely more than a year after she married. Lafave, pictured left at court in 2005 with an unidentified woman. Right, pictured with her ex-husband Owen Lafave in 2004 before they divorced . The story took a bizarre twist after John Gillespie, the lead detective in her case, was arrested before the trial in an unrelated prostitution sting, while Tampa Bay Police officers were probed when it was revealed they took graphic nude photos of Lafave while she was in stirrups in a jail cell. In 2009, once she completed sex offender therapy, a judge allowed her to have contact with her relative's children, though she was still banned from living within 1,000 feet of where children congregate. Lafave later went on national television to explain her actions, attributing her indiscretions to bipolar disorder, hyper-sexuality and poor judgement during manic episodes. Her ex-husband, Owen Lafave, left her and also appeared on a number of chat shows, before she remarried and gave birth to twins. Three years ago, a retiring judge offered leniency to Lafave - who now uses her maiden name Beasley - but in a move an appellate court later ruled to have been an 'abuse of judicial power'. Lafave, pictured in a 2007 mugshot, was arrested in 2004 after being reported by her victim's mother. Right, she is pictured pregnant with her twins to her second husband . But before the judge made that ruling, a sister of Lafave's victim - who is now in his twenties - said her brother's mental health has been devastated. Her voice shaking, the sister was allowed to testify after giving only her initials. 'This is something that has consumed his life,' she said, adding that her brother remained under psychiatric care and was himself opposed to an early end to her probation. Lafave was reported by the boy's mother in May of 2004 and was immediately arrested. She was charged with two counts of felonies after pleading guilty to having sexual intercourse and oral sex on four different occasions with the boy - one of which was at the school. The disgraced teacher avoided jail entirely, despite facing up to 30 years behind bars if convicted. She was then sentenced to only seven years probation and three years house arrest. She is banned from teaching in Florida for life.","Debra Lafave won the appeal against her sex offender probation in Florida on Thursday .

"Adult entertainment website PornHub announced it is starting a music label, called Pornhub Records. The announcement was made in a Billboard interview on Wednesday with Pornhub record executives Matt Blake and Corey Price. 'We've always seen a strong music presence from the beginning of Pornhub,' Blake told the website. 'Artists upload their own stuff, like uncensored tracks and R-rated versions of songs,' the head of PR and marketing continued. 'Some people come in and upload exclusive videos, so it creates a buzz for them.' New venture: Adult entertainment company Pornhub announced it is starting a music label, called PornHub Records . Pornhub Records also has a newly-revealed song contest, which it says will give artists 'Minimum 5,000 views guaranteed' - but a record deal is not guaranteed as part of the grand prize, Billboard reported. 'We'll help produce the official music video and feature it on Pornhub TV,' Pornhub promises online. 'A&R is a work in progress,' Blake told Billboard. 'Right now it's all about forming relationships and understanding how this all works. We're focused on distributing through the platform and digital sales.' Artists Coolio, Xiu Xiu and FaltyDL already have videos with the new music company, the  website reported. Price revealed to Billboard 'We're looking for acts that aren't necessarily porn-focused.' 'We're an ad-based network looking for content that appeals to our demographic,' the vice president continued. 'Mature lyrics for an adult audience; no boy bands or teen-pop, for instance.' Price also said that 'Producers, music technicians, everyone in the business you could imagine' contacted the record label. 'There's erotic folk, rap, country - everybody has come to us.' Price revealed to MailOnline that adult film stars have even expressed interest in music careers. 'We’ve been approached by all sorts of people – from adult stars, to mainstream celebs, to music producers, sound engineers etc. It’s been a work-in-progress so far, so we’re pretty happy with where we’ve come getting everything off the ground. As far as signing, we’re definitely considering some of the folks who’ve approached us, especially if they’re talented, but this label and the song contest are for the people first. 'Our whole mission is to put the word out and catch the attention of fledgling musicians or enthusiasts that are looking for a platform for their art. It’s the fans and viewers that have helped us grow into what we are, and so this is mainly a way for us to give back to the community; to give people a voice.' Asked if the record label will release new music soundtracks, as opposed to '70-style funk soundtracks stereotypically associated with adult films, Price said 'while 70s funk soundtracks may have been the rage 40+ years ago, I don’t think it’s necessarily the case now. But hey, that’s what this contest and this label is all about – hopefully we’ll get our hands on some amazing material to put out.'

'And yes, that is how the malware authors spelled 'leprechaun'. 'We hope they were going for a clever play on the word 'con.' The malware comes in the form of a wallpaper app. Google removed five of these applications after we alerted them to the issue, but it is believed the apps had between 100-500 installs each at the time of removal. Lookout says bitcoin 'rogue apps' could become commonplace. 'We expect to see more mobile miners come to the foreground,' the firm warned. The warning is the second over bitcoin apps that can install themselves on Android handsets. Last month researchers discovered CoinKrypt that focused on coins such as Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Casinocoin. The people behind this malware decided to go for these 'low-hanging fruit' coins because you can actually mine more coins with less computing power. Security firm Lookout today revealed it found a piece of mobile malware in Google Play that quietly uses the phone¿s processing power to create new coins. However, the researchers say both scams were unlikely to have made hackers much money. 'A phone’s computing power doesn’t actually result in that many coins,' they said. 'The difficulty for Bitcoin is so tough right now that a recent mining experiment using 600 quadcore servers was only able to generate 0.4 Bitcoins over one year.' Because of these difficulty levels, miners often don’t work alone. Instead, they work in groups, pooling their processing resources. They collect payment as a percentage of the processing power they contribute.","Google has already been forced to remove dozens of 'rogue' apps using the scam .

"Dog-lovers everywhere have been left outraged after video footage appeared online showing two council workers opening a yard gate and letting a dog run free. Queensland’s Bundaberg Regional Council has been forced to apologise on behalf of their workers, after the video went viral around the world. The video, which was posted to Sooty Daul’s Facebook page, has garnered over 240,000 views since it was uploaded on the social media site two days ago. A video of council workers opening a gate and setting a dog free has gone viral, with many outraged at their actions . The footage clearly shows one worker entering the property, patting the dog and apparently stepping aside to let the animal past. When the second man enters the yard he holds the gate open so the dog can gain access to the street. In a Facebook post, Sooty Daul, who is believed to be the dog in question, warned other dog owners of misbehaving council workers. “ALL DOG OWNERS beware of ‘council dog inspectors’ deliberately letting your beloved family pet out. I am requesting BRC supply a written apology and explanation for this behaviour & disciplinary action against this employee/contractor,” he said. The men can clearly be seen opening the gate for the animal and patting him on the head before waving the dog on his way . Sooty the dog has taken to his Facebook page to let loose on the workers, telling other dog owners to watch out . When asked if the dog arrived home safely, Sooty reveals that the dog was safe but that he was nearly impounded. “Sure is BS, Sooty is back home for now, almost got taken away by the pound (go figure),” the post said. “I contacted BRC,their response at this stage was ‘call back tomorrow,’ they did make a very slow attempt to go after her once Danielle was informed, ‘your dog is out’,” the page said. Bundabery Regional Council has apologised for the incident but has claimed that the dog was never in danger of being impounded . Speaking to the Courier Mail, local Peta Merritt said she witnessed the incident. “I finished having a coffee with a friend and I noticed the same people at a property, (I) didn’t think much of it until the dog scooted out of the property and was running,” Mrs Merritt said. “I nearly hit the dog and the car (in) front of me. I was distracted and couldn’t focus 100 per cent on driving; I’m still a little shooken (sic) up from the incident.” The council worker seems to rethink his actions as the dog strolls out of the gate on to the busy street . Bundaberg Regional Council has responded to the incident, apologising to the owner and claiming they are ‘disappointed’ at the chain of events. According to the council’s Health and Regulatory Services portfolio spokesperson, Cr Wayne Honor, thousands of properties were undergoing inspection that day. The worker steps outside to see where the dog has gone but he doesn't go far. He then goes back inside and closes the gate . “I have seen the CCTV footage regarding this unfortunate incident but what the footage does not show is two members of our inspection team pursuing the dog almost immediately. “Additionally, a Council Local Law Officer was called to assist and the dog was recovered very quickly,” Cr Honor said . Cr Honor said that the dog was never at risk of being impounded. He said the dog was unregistered and he has advised the owner to register the animal as soon as possible. Members of the survey team had again been briefed by Council on the importance of ensuring their own safety and the security of animals located on private property.","A video of council workers opening a gate and setting a dog free has gone viral .

"The national broadcaster has refused to apologise to one of Australia's highest profile military officers, Captain Cate McGregor, caught up in a public furore over anti-transgender tweets aimed at her during the popular Q&A program. Viewers have railed against the published comments, even calling for the moderator's sacking but the ABC insists the tweets were 'within guidelines'. Posts included 'Wow she/he is a hero' and 'God sets our gender, we shouldn't interfere', angering many viewers of the current affairs panel discussion. But an ABC spokesperson has told Daily Mail Australia that: 'Q&A’s on-screen tweets are selected through a multi-stage moderation process to provide an alternative layer around the studio discussion based on the commentary of viewers on Twitter'. Scroll down for video . 'The tweets are chosen to reflect the diverse range of opinions in the Q&A audience,' the ABC said. 'We believe the tweets you identify meet those guidelines and were appropriate for broadcast.' One of the tweets which offended some viewers . One of the tweets considered most offensive originated from an account listed as Security Advisers, but it was quickly removed as the social media backlash mounted. Security Advisers is an independent group which claims to provide strategic advice to government agencies and corporate Australia, and the tweet was apparently sent by mistake. While the Q & A earned praise for inviting a transgender panellist for the first time and seeking her view on how the community can make life easier for those who make a gender choice, the fallout from the reaction of those watching has continued. This post from a corporate account of a security firm was quickly deleted . But there appears little chance of a public apology, as demanded by some viewers. There were even those calling for the sacking of those moderating the published tweets. 'The tweets are chosen to reflect the diverse range of opinions in the Q&A audience,' the ABC said. 'We believe the tweets you identify meet those guidelines and were appropriate for broadcast.' Group Captain Cate McGregor is considered one of Australia's most influential women and has won great support for her performance on Q & A and for her reaction to the controversial tweets. The public backlash also included viewers calling for the sacking of those moderating the published tweets . The backlash was immediate, with viewers calling the comments of others 'disrespectful and offensive' 'I was called a boy for a long time, I was called a lot worse actually too,' she said on Q&A. The RAAF Group Captain was born Malcolm McGregor in 1956 in Toowoomba, in Northern Queensland. After much heartache and depression, the life-changing event to become a woman took place in 2012. 'There may be some people who may have felt incredibly conflicted by that language, it didn't, I transitioned quite late in life and had functioned as a male for a darn long time and had far worse stuff said to me from first slip when I was batting at cricket.' However, not all the social media comments to the program caused anger, there were those who applauded Q&A for inviting a transgender panellist for the first time . Cate McGregor is a close friend of Prime Minister Tony Abbott after first locking horns on the rugby field in the 1980s. As Malcolm McGregor she had worked for both sides of politics . Cate McGregor counts the Prime Minister among her friends, after they first locked horns on the rugby field more than 30 years ago and has worked for both sides of politics. 'It's no bargain being trans, if you have lived with that level of conflict and difficulty, it's a tough decision. I admire immensely people who come out young and early. It wasn't a huge career enhancer or bargain for me to do it, it happened to me after a lot of agony. 'When you choose to express your gender then be treated with respect and appropriate pronouns and so on and I've largely had that.' Transphobia is not something the leading ADF official has encountered much of since making the decision to change. She told Australian Story earlier this year, 'with very few exceptions most people are gracious'. 'It's almost too exquisite being alive, I really mean that, it's a wonderful feeling to be alive and be me.'","Group Captain Cate McGregor was targeted by offensive tweets as she appeared on the popular ABC TV program .

"Renowned: Federico Garcia Lorca, pictured, was among tens of thousands of civilians killed by militias loyal to the late General Francisco Franco in 1936 . Archaeologists will start inspecting land in southern Spain where radical poet Federico Garcia Lorca is believed to have been executed and buried  in 1936. Lorca, one of Spain's most renowned 20th-century poets, was among tens of thousands of civilians killed by militias loyal to late dictator General Francisco Franco at the start of the Spanish Civil War. The search for his grave remains one of the greatest mysteries of the 1936-1939 war, which was started when Franco rose up against Spain's elected leftist Republican government. Experts will begin this latest bid to uncover his remains by sounding a roughly 3,200 sq. ft of hillside close to the southern city of Granada. The process involves using radar to send pulses through the soil - with echos reflecting back any significant change in soil condition. Initial work in the area, which begins 17 November, will not involve any digging, according to officials. They added that it will be up to a court to decide on the next step if signs of bones are detected. Luis Naranjo, an official with the southern regional government of Andalusia, said that the project is aimed at discovering the remains of Civil War victims, not specifically those of Lorca. Lorca is best known for tragedies such as 'Blood Wedding' and his poetry collections 'Poet in New York and 'Gypsy Ballads.' His work draws on universal themes like love, death, passion, cruelty and injustice. An earlier high-profile dig for his grave, which took place over two months in 2009, yielded no results. At the time, the poet's family initially opposed the dig, saying that they preferred to let the remains lie in peace. Relatives also argued that Lorca should not be singled out for recognition when so many families were also seeking to recover missing loved ones. They later said they might be prepared to offer DNA samples to help with identification if bones were found. Enduring mystery: Experts will begin this latest bid to uncover his remains by sounding a roughly 3,200 sq. ft of hillside close to the southern city of Granada. Above, a view of the general area where the work will take lace . Federico García Lorca, one of Spain's most renowned poets and dramatists was born June 5, 1898, in Fuente Vaqueros, a small town a few miles from Granada. He later moved to Madrid, where he joined a radical group of students and became close friends with the artist Salvador Dali, with whom it is thought he had a turbulent love affair, and Luis Luis Buñuel, the film director. In 1930, after a brief stint in New York City, Lorca returned to Spain, which had been declared a republic. The following year he began touring nationally with his own theatre group, La Barraca, for the Republic's Ministry of Education. He is best known for tragedies such as 'Blood Wedding' and his poetry collections 'Poet in New York and 'Gypsy Ballads.' By 1936, when Lorca was 38, he was a highly visible figure with known Republican sympathies. On 16 August that year, García Lorca was staying at Callejones de García, his country home, at the outbreak of the Civil War. He was arrested by Franquist soldiers and taken into custody. Two days later, they took Lorca  to the grave of his brother-in-law, Manuel Fernandez Montesinos - the Socialist ex-mayor of Granada whom the soldiers had murdered and dragged through the streets. There Lorca was murdered, along with two bullfighters and a schoolteacher. His books were burned in Granada’s Plaza del Carmen and were soon banned from Franco’s Spain.","Poet Federico Garcia Lorca was executed and buried at start of Civil War .

"South Carolina candidate for U.S. Senate and reality show star Thomas Ravenel broke up with his on-and-off screen younger girlfriend Kathryn Dennis and the couple did it on social media for all the world to see. Southern Charm stars and parents of a baby girl Ravenel, 52, and Dennis, 23, suggested in Facebook and Twitter posts over the weekend that they were the one doing the breaking up. The news comes right on the heels of revelations from the Charleston police who say they're investigating charges Ravenel assaulted Dennis's hairdresser Lauren Moser earlier this month. Scroll down for video . Derailed again? U.S. senate hopeful Thomas Ravenel wanted to get his political career back on track after a 2007 cocaine conviction derailed it, but now he's being investigated for assaulting his Southern Charm co-star's hairdresser Lauren Moser. Here, Ravenel is pictured with daughter Kensington . Wouldn't leave filming? Seen here with her Southern Charm co-stars, Dennis (center) has been on Georgia's Jekyll Island filming for the show. Ravenel says she was scheduled to travel back to South Carolina to defend his good name, but that she backed out at the last minute . According to Ravenel's Facebook announcement of the breakup, Dennis knows the truth about what happened between the Senate hopeful and Moser--information that could save his campaign--but she's too consumed by fame to help him out of the pickle. 'When the allegations surfaced that I had assaulted Kathryn Dennis' hairdresser, I pleaded with Kathryn to leave the Bravo shoot,' Ravenel, who hopes to unseat Republican Lindsey Graham. Ravenel claims in his post that Dennis was all set to leave filming on Georgia's Jekyll Island. He says Dennis told him she was coming but backed out at the last minute--a disaster for his campaign. 'The temptation of missing film time was a more a important value to her. So telling. Our relationship is over,' he said. Dennis, whose pregnancy news dramatically punctuated the first season of the Bravo reality series, hit back on Twitter around 1am Monday morning. 'I'm doing what's best for my daughter, and presently that is not being with Thomas,' Dennis tweeted. Then, on Monday afternoon, the consummate politician halfheartedly apologized. 'While I was shocked and stunned at the situation I was in, no father should EVER speak negatively of the mother of his child. I was wrong,' Ravenel tweeted. The drama has its roots in the alleged October 17 event now being investigated by Charleston police. According to the assault allegation, reports the Charlotte Observer, Dennis and her hairstylist Moser were sitting outside a Charleston home when Ravenel showed up and began lecturing Dennis about the way she was caring for the baby. Did time: Ravenel was once the South Carolina Treasurer before a cocaine charge derailed his career and saw him sent away for six months . 'Our relationship is over': The couple were seee kissing in an Instagram photo just two weeks ago, but have since severed ties . Dennis' hairstylist Lauren Moser says Ravenel assaulted her with a door on October 17 . HER SIDE: LAUREN MOSER'S POLICE REPORT . A complaint filed to Charleston, South Carolina police by Kathryn Dennis's hairdresser Lauren Moser paints Senate hopeful Ravenel as temperamental and abusive. An excerpt of the complaint via the Charleston City Paper: . The victim stated that as she was walking behind the offender into the house he swung the door hard (as to close it) when he cleared [the] doorway and it bounced off of the victim's knee. The victim stated that when the offender saw that the door did not close he turned and swung the door again and this time the door struck the victim on the inside of the right arm due to the fact that her hand was raised because she was videoing the episode. The victim stated that the door hit her so hard it caused her to topple backwards down three steps and into some bushes. HIS SIDE: RAVENEL BEGS KATHRYN DENNIS TO HAVE HIS BACK . Thomas Ravenel is beiong investigated following Moser's claims, which he denies completely. If true, these accusations would spell the end of Ravenel's already all-but-derailed political career. He posted to Facebook along with news of their breakup that Dennis was scheduled to leave Southern Charm filming in Georgia return to South Carolina and defend Ravenel. Dennis, Ravenel writes, preferred to stay and film the show. Ravenel has since taken the post down, but it's been preserved by the Charlotte Observer: . When the allegations surfaced that I had assaulted Kathryn Dennis' hairdresser, I pleaded with Kathryn to leave the Bravo shoot in Jekyll Island. They had even packed her bags and had lined up a driver. She told me she was coming to clear my name but then she backed out at the last second and delayed telling the truth by 1 an 1/2 days. $900k of my campaign money down the drain. The investigators even told me that if she would have come and corroborated the accuser's story I would be cleared. The temptation of missing film time was a more a important value to her. So telling. Our relationship is over. Apology: Ravenel took down the Facebook post and the next day apologized via Twitter for the way he'd spoken about Dennis . Moser's complaint claims Ravenel then 'slipped and fell into the pool with the baby' before handing her off to Dennis. Moser said she was following Ravenel into the house when he slammed the door on her knee and arm. Ravenel denied the assault claims, but a read of his full Facebook post regaring his breakup with Dennis reveals the denial likely won't be enough to salvage what's left of his political career. This isn't Ravenel's first brush with political infamy. Ravenel was once South Carolina's Treasurer before being convicted on a cocaine charge and serving six months in prison. Prior to his conviction, Ravenel was the working as Rudy Giuliani's campaign manager in the state. Ravenel was also arrested on DWI charges in Montauk, New York in 2013.

"Tinder is planning to set up a premium service allowing paying users of the app to have more match-making powers. Sean Rad, the two-year-old company's CEO and founder made the announcement at the Forbes Under 30 Summit in Philadelphia. He told the magazine that the new feature will be released in November and could involve travel, meaning location limits could be scrapped. 'Freemium model': Tinder is set to release a new feature next month that will give paying users more matchmaking powers . The 'freemium model' is popular with users and has already been adopted by sites including OkCupid and Match.com. Without going into details, he also hinted that the service could expand beyond online dating and could move into restaurant and bar recommendations. Changes: Sean Rad, the two-year-old company's CEO made the announcement at the Forbes Under 30 Summit in Philadelphia . Tinder lets you swipe though an endless stream of photos of people looking to meet up. Each profile only has a handful of photos - but you can only interact with people in the city you're currently in. He said: 'We are adding features users have been begging us for. They will offer so much value we think users are willing to pay for them.' 'We had to get our product and growth right first. Revenue has always been on the road map.' The app, that has become popular around the globe, sees 1.2billion profiles swiped and 15million matches mad every day. The upgrade will mean users can still use the free version, but a fee will give them access to better features. When Rad announced that the app had hit 10million likes a day in February - he claimed that individuals were using it seven times a day on average. It generated at least 75 million matches in 2013 after launching at a University of Southern California party. The same month the app was first used in Antarctica when a lonely scientist working at the McMurdo Station  revealed that he recently turned to Tinder to find a mate and was pleasantly surprised to find one – even though she was a 45 minute helicopter ride away.","New feature could lead to location limits being scrapped .

"The illegitimate son a wealthy Spanish aristocrat has been awarded a €2million (£1.6m) inheritance in a five-year legal battle reminiscent of a Downton Abbey plot. Esteban Marchena García, 59, was born to 17-year-old servant girl Encarnacion Marchena in 1955, after she had an affair with the late Seville-based landowner Juan Velez Utrera. As the boy was illegitimate Utera refused to recognise him as his son, which led to his adoption and eventually to him receiving no money when his father died aged 82 in 2001. But following a lengthy legal fight that saw his family secretly exhume Utera's body and have it cremated in order to destroy the DNA, a judge has now ruled that Marchena, who works as a waiter in Malaga, has the same right to the family fortune as his three legitimate brothers. Illegitimate: Esteban Marchena García, 59, was born to 17-year-old servant girl Encarnacion Marchena in 1955, after she had an affair with the late Seville-based landowner Juan Velez Utrera . Marchena was born on his father's estate near Seville at a time when the law allowed wealthy aristocrats to easily disown children they had fathered outside of marriage. The problem was particularly prevalent in southern Spain in the mid-1950s. As she was not receiving any additional income to look after her son, his mother was forced to give Marchena up for adoption, although the pair kept in regular contact, according to The Times. When Utrera died in 2001 his estate was divided between his legitimate offspring. Eight years later Marchena started legal action to claim his share of the money, claiming his mother deserved justice after being forced to give up the child she loved. In a bizarre twist early in the case, Utrera's family dug up the aristocrat's body and had it cremated before DNA tests ordered by the court could be conducted. The tests were ordered in the hope of proving Utrera was Marchena's father - something his family had long denied. But the judge this week finally ruled in favour of Marchena and awarded him $2million - claiming the 'extraordinary obstruction' of his three brothers and the family likeness was enough to prove Utrera had been his biological father. Marchena is not the only illegitimate Spanish waiter to launch a high-profile court case arguing his right to an aristocratic inheritance. Alberto Sola (left) claims he is the son of Spain's former King Juan Carlos (right) The case came to court after Spain changed its inheritance laws in 2006, allowing women and children born outside marriages the same right to inherit family fortunes as their legitimate siblings. Since then dozens of high profile cases have emerged where the first-born daughters of aristocrats and politicians have been granted wealth and titles they wouldn't have received under the old law. Bizarrely Marchena is not the only illegitimate Spanish waiter to launch a high-profile court case arguing his right to a large inheritance from his aristocratic father. Alberto Sola, 58, whose adoptive parents are peasants from Catalonia, claims he is the illegitimate son of Spain's former King Juan Carlos - the monarch who abdicated the throne in July and allegedly bedded more than 1,500 women. In August - after the former king lost his  immunity by quitting quit the throne - Sola lodged his claim in the country's highest court in a bid to finally prove he is of royal blood.","Esteban Marchena García was born to a 17-year-old servant girl in 1955 .

"Suge Knight has pleaded not guilty to a robbery charge filed over an incident in which a celebrity photographer accused the Death Row Records founder of stealing her camera.

He was arrested in Las Vegas last week and fell while in jail, and his attorneys said he bruised his head and neck.

The founder of Death Row Records was detained in Las Vegas, Nevada . The 49-year-old appeared in a Los Angeles courtroom Wednesday and had his bail set at $500,000. Beverly Hills Police confirmed to the MailOnline that while the arrests have been made, the investigation remains ongoing. In a statement, the District Attorney's Office said the incident occurred outside a recording studio just days after Suge was shot in late August during Chris Brown's Pre-VMA party at a Hollywood nightclub. Beverly Hills Police confirmed to the MailOnline that while the arrests have been made, the investigation remains ongoing . Beverly Hills Police confirmed to the MailOnline that while the arrests have been made, the investigation remains ongoing . According to the District Attorney's Office: 'The two men are suspected of stealing the camera of an independent celebrity photographer on Sept. 5 outside a studio in Beverly Hills.' If found guilty, Suge faces significantly more time than Katt due to a previous assault with a deadly weapon conviction, the DA said. 'If convicted, Knight, who has a prior conviction for assault with a deadly weapon, faces up to 30 years to life in state prison. Williams faces up to seven years in custody.' Photos of the alleged incident show a woman nursing an injured finger, however, neither Katt nor Suge were pictured at the scene. On Aug. 24, the rap mogul was shot six times inside Chris Brown's pre-VMA party at a Hollywood nightclub . Beverly Hills police Sgt. Max Subin told the LA Times that after coming out of the studio the comedian and hip hop mogul came across the photographer and allegedly chased the woman down an alley. The officer said Kat then grabbed the woman's camera 'forcibly' and she 'sustained minor injuries'. When police arrived on the scene, both of the stars had left, he said. Neither man has been charged with assault. Both Suge - whose real name is Marion - and Katt - real name Micah - have had their fair share of run-ins with police. When he was arrested, Katt was to face court over a July 15 incident in Inglewood when he allegedly pepper-sprayed a man and tried to hit him with his car. The comedian was charged with two counts of felony assault in addition to the use of tear gas. That same month, Los Angeles County sheriffs were called to the Comedy Store in West Hollywood after reports he pulled out a gun and smashed a car window. No charges were laid over that incident. He was imprisoned twice more for violating his parole after being caught consorting with gang members and then assaulting a valet in 2003 . Suge's rap sheet is a little longer, with the 49-year-old first arrested in 1992 on assault and weapons charges for which he received probation. However in 1996, he was arrested after security cameras at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas caught him and a group of other men beating a gang member. He was sentenced to nine years in prison for parole violation. He was imprisoned twice more for violating his parole after being caught consorting with gang members and then assaulting a valet in 2003. Suge has also been the victim of a number of serious crimes - and has been shot three times. Besides getting shot in August, Suge was also injured in 2005, when he was shot in Miami during another pre-awards party. Most famously he was hit by bullet fragments in 1996 in Las Vegas when he was sitting next to rapper Tupac Shakur during a drive-by hit on their car. Tupac did not survive.","49-year-old has bail set at $500,000 .

This can become a cycle that feeds itself - you envy a colleague's, friend's, or celebrity's figure and then look at yourself thinking I can never live up to them, and so on. Put the advice below to work before you seriously damage your self-esteem. 8 – 12 YES answers: OBSESSIVELY ENVIOUS . Not only do so many yes answers suggest body-envy is damaging your self-esteem and body image but it'll also damage your relationships with other women. This great big cloud of envy blocks out appreciating their personalities and inner qualities - as you should appreciate your own. Beginning with yourself become actively aware each time you think about your body. It's worth keeping a record [even in simple counting-form] for a few days about how often you do. It may be an eye-opener. Use a motto to challenge these negative body-thoughts, e.g., 'I'm so much more than my body.' Dr Pam's book can help combat low self-esteem issues . Identify your hot-spots – things that start the self-criticising chain reaction. Do you hate your body when you've had too big a meal, when shopping for clothes, when around a friend/colleague who has a good figure? Know your 'enemy' and prepare for these. Prepare by talking yourself up. For instance, tell yourself your friend (with the good figure) would hate knowing you feel bad about yourself when in her company. Talking yourself up with common sense calms down troubled feelings of envy. Focus outward on the good things in your life that matter more than lumps or bumps. And focus inward on you who are so much more than your waist size. Yes, easily said but it's in your power to focus your mind instead of letting it control you with thoughts of body-envy. Feeling fit combats body-envy. Feel invigorated with regular walks, swims, the gym, salsa classes, etc. Plus, mind your posture – stand tall, pull in your core muscles and see how good it feels. Everyone, no matter size and shape, feels better when fit. Now you see other women's figures as a threat. Overcome this irrational thinking by questioning it. How are they a threat? How does a woman having a good figure affect your life? The honest answers are they don't affect your life. Mind your language – when talking about other women stop yourself discussing their figures. Be aware of conversations slipping into shallow territory about someone's looks. Stop revelling in someone putting on weight and being aware when you react negatively to someone just because you think they're better looking. You don't have to 'emotionalise' everything so, e.g., take a so-what attitude if an attractive woman is on TV/movie when your partner's around. Rationalise it - he's not going to run off with an actress, is he? This may seem impossible when eaten up with body-envy, but learn not to care when a colleague has a great figure – and even be happy for a friend who does. Remind yourself it is no reflection on you. Finally, if you can't break the body-envy trap consider confidence and self-esteem coaching or counselling. Life is short, you are unique, and you need to break free of this damaging thinking and behaviour.

"A man in an inflatable bubble was rescued by the coast guard 70 nautical miles East of St. Augustine on Saturday morning in a bizarre attempt to run to Bermuda from Florida. Reza Baluchi was found in an inflatable hydro bubble on Wednesday, but waved coast guard officers off, saying he was determined to make the 1,033-mile journey himself. But three days later he was too exhausted to carry on - so had to be rescued. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Strange traveler: The Coast Guard rescued Reza Baluchi from his Hydro Bubble 70 miles away from St. Augustine, Florida on Saturday . Helicopter rescue: Once all of the aircrew arrived, a rescue swimmer got Baluchi from his inflatable raft and into a helicopter where he was later evaluated by medical crews and found to be uninjured . Philanthropist: Reza Baluchi is both a daredevil and philanthropist dedicated to achieving great feats and  raising money and awareness for impoverished children in the process . When rescuers first discovered him on Wednesday, he was disoriented and asking for directions to Bermuda. His bubble contraption was filled with protein bars and bottled water - though he had claimed before leaving he would mostly survive by fishing. The Coast Guard were worried straight away by Baluchi's state of exhaustion and lack of supplies, so asked him to end his mission. He refused, so they continued to monitor him until he activated his Personal Locating Beacon on Saturday morning. When the call came, an HC-130 airplane and a MH-60 helicopter were dispatched to his rescue along with a rescue ship. Once all of the aircrew arrived, a rescue swimmer got Baluchi from his inflatable raft and into a helicopter where he was later evaluated by medical crews. He was not injured. According to Baluchi's website Runwithreza.org, he was on a mission to travel from Florida to Bermuda to prove that the Bermuda Triangle is not dangerous. On the site he says: 'Everyone wants to know how Reza Baluchi will be successful in his travel to through the Bermuda triangle. Reza is so confident that he will succeed in this trip because he has carefully articulated every detail it takes to survive.' Avid runner: Reza Baluchi once ran 135 miles nonstop from Death Valley, California to Mt. Whitney,California . Long Journey: Reza Baluchi was attempting to travel 1,033 miles from Florida to Bermuda . Baluchi claims he designed his Hydro Pod specifically to take him on his journey across the ocean - though it was never going to be a walk in the park. He said: 'Being inside the Hydro Pod is not going to be a walk in the park; it will be very hot and humid. One can easily dehydrate quickly and lose breath. 'Reza has devised this Hydro Pod to prevent physical difficulties. But not anyone can use without being mentally and physically fit. Being mentally fit is the main component to be able to survive a long journey in the Hydro Pod.' In 2013, Reza tested his Hydro Pod by taking it out from Newport Beach to Catalina Island with apparently great success. Reza next wanted cross the Bermuda Triangle because of the stories of shipwrecks and plane crashed linked to the area. The Bermuda Triangle, also known as the Devil's Triangle, is a region in the western part of the Atlantic in which an imaginary line is drawn from Miami to Bermuda to Puerto Rico. Vessels have mysteriously disappeared on the journey but mostly in the journey from Florida to Puerto Rico. On his website, Baluchi describes how the avenger plane Flight 19 took off from the Florida Naval Base in 1945 and never returned after crossing that threshold. 'Reza is aware of the accidents that could happen to him including death. The Bermuda Triangle is one of the deadliest stretches of ocean on Earth. Call him ""crazy"" but likes to roll the dice,' he says on his site. Reza Baluchi is still alive and unharmed but whether or not he will attempt his journey once again across the Devil's Triangle is a mystery. 1.The distance between Miami, Fl to Bermuda is approximately 1,033 miles one way. 2. The Hydro Pod is made of 3mm thick of plastic. 3. Inside the Hydro Pod it will reach up 120 degrees Fahrenheit. 4. Reza is an excellent fisherman and he will be catching his food on a daily basis. There be will some days that he will not be able to catch fish. So he will he survive on his own made up protein bars. 5  He will need to manually pump his Hydro Pod for one hour to ensure that it will stay afloat. 6. At night the Hydro Pod will have a light emitting from the bottom to help with the travel. 7. Reza will rest in the early hours of the morning when the sea is calmest . 8. On a daily basis 400,000 ships sail through the Bermuda without harm or loss . 9.The frame is designed by Mr. Reza Baluchi. 10. A typical day will be, Reza will be sleeping from 6am-9am, will wake up to start running until his body becomes too hot, he will then jump into the sea to cool himself off with a leash strapped to his leg connected to the bubble. 11.He will sleep on a hammock that will be inside the bubble. 12. He will have tracking device on him so that his team is aware of his position at all times. 13. Reza is doing this dangerous journey to raise money for children in need and to give inspire     those that have lost hope for a better future. Also to raise awareness for his Non-Profit Organization called Plant Unity. Plant Unity is a charity devoted to kids that are in need of basic living necessities. For example, clothes, medical and financial help and also to teach them healthy living skills. Plant Unity slogan is 'Children are like roots of a tree – I like to nourish the roots and help them grow.'

"A record 54 per cent of families are now using discount stores – and high street prices are showing ‘historic’ falls as a result. The surge of budget chains such as Aldi, Lidl and Poundland, plus cheap fashion outlets including Primark, is delivering the biggest change in shopping habits since the 1950s. Industry figures show the average price across 500 of the most commonly bought products fell by 1.8 per cent in September. 'Historic' changes: The surge of budget chains such as Aldi, Lidl (pictured) and Poundland, plus cheap fashion outlets including Primark, is delivering the biggest change in shopping habits since the 1950s . The price of non-food items was down by an average of 3.2 per cent with particularly big falls for fashion, shoes and electrical items. Clothes were 10.2 per cent cheaper than a year ago, largely because retailers were forced to slash the cost of autumn coats and jumpers which did not sell because of the unusually warm weather. The figures come from the British Retail Consortium, which said food prices showed a modest annual increase of 0.3 per cent – the lowest level since the BRC launched its Shop Price Index in 2006. The cost of putting meals on the table has been tamed by a price war – triggered by the rise of Aldi and Lidl – forcing mainstream supermarkets to cut the cost of essentials. Discount supermarket chains such as Aldi are eating into the profits of the 'big four' supermarkets . Market shares figures this year showed large growth for discount supermarkets Aldi and Lidl . The high street revolution has been a financial disaster for the likes of Tesco, Britain’s biggest retailer, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons. Tesco has lost around half its market value – about £15billion – in just one year, amid a record fall in sales that has followed decades of growth. Such is the pressure on the chain that some senior executives stand accused of signing off suspect accounts which appear to have overstated profits by £250million. Industry figures show Tesco’s sales are down by 4.5 per cent, while takings are down by 2.8 per cent at Sainsbury’s and 1.8 per cent at Morrisons. Research by the Institute of Grocery Distribution found 54 per cent of consumers have visited a discount store in search of bargains in the past month. As a result, sales are up by 29.1 per cent at Aldi and 17.7 per cent at Lidl as the two chains race to open new outlets at the rate of two a week. Morrisons has announced its intention to match the low prices of discount supermarkets . Joanne Denney-Finch, IGD chief executive, said: ‘Over half of shoppers tell us they’ve used a discounter in the past month, which is the highest level for four years when we started tracking the data. ‘Examples of good retail disciplines that shoppers tell us they like about discounters include: it’s easy to find things, they can get around the store really quickly and the meat is clearly labelled as British. ‘Over half of shoppers want price cuts more than multi-buys … People want pricing that makes a real difference.’ Morrisons boss Dalton Philips has described the retail change as the biggest since the rise of the big-box supermarkets in the 1950s. Last week he unveiled a bid to ‘neutralise’ the threat from Aldi and Lidl by launching a loyalty card scheme – the first to try and match their prices. Mike Watkins, head of Retail Insight for Nielsen described the price falls as ‘historic’.","Record number  have shopped at a discount supermarket in the past month .

"The U.S. stock market is capping a seesaw month by jumping to all-time highs just two weeks after enduring its worst slump since 2012. Global markets roared higher after Japan's central bank committed to a huge increase in its purchases of bonds and other assets, the country's latest effort to shake off two decades of economic stagnation. In the U.S., stocks extended a late-month rally that has been powered by strong corporate earnings. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 168 points, or 1 per cent, to 17,361 near close on Friday afternoon. Happy Halloween! The Dow Jones revealed a huge rally today after the Bank of Japan unexpectedly announced new stimulus to boost the country's flagging economic recovery . Costumed characters distribute Hershey candies as trader Edward Curran works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Halloween. U.S. stocks are opening higher following big gains in Asia after Japan made moves to rev up its economy . The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 19 points, or 1 percent, to 2,014 and the Nasdaq composite rose 59 points, or 1.3 percent, to 4,625. Both the Dow and the S&P 500 index are back at record highs and the Nasdaq composite is at its highest level in 14 years. It's a remarkable feat for the stock market, especially since Wall Street experienced one of its most volatile months since the 2008 financial crisis. It was a month rocked by massive sell-offs but also record highs in a period of just a few days. The market weakness investors experienced starting in mid-September spilled over into October. Fears that Europe's economy was slipping back into a recession, a plunge in oil prices and some early economic data that showed weakness in the U.S. economy sent investors fleeing the market. Those fears sent stocks, for the most part, straight down for two weeks. The nadir came October 15, when the S&P 500 nearly went into what's known as a correction, defined as a decline of 10 percent or more in a benchmark index from a recent high. Many investors have been expecting the stock market to have a correction, a phenomenon that historically occurs every 18 months or so.  The last one happened in late 2011. Shortly after its mid-October swoon, the market bounced back at a dizzying pace. Strong U.S. corporate earnings were the primary driver of the rebound, as well as signs that central banks in Japan and Europe were going to do all they could to stop their economies from dragging everyone else down with them. 'I don't think it's a surprise that we came close to a correction. We've been expecting one for a while. I think the bigger surprise has been how we rip-roared all the way back up,' said Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management. 'When you hit someone over their head with a hammer, you don't expect them to get up immediately.' The Dow and S&P 500 are up 2 per cent for the month, while the Nasdaq is up nearly 3 per cent. Friday's gains were driven by the Bank of Japan, which surprised investors by announcing it would increase its bond and asset purchases by 10 trillion yen to 20 trillion yen ($90.7 billion to $181.3 billion) to about 80 trillion yen ($725 billion) annually. The announcement came after economic data showed that Japan's economy remained in the doldrums, with household spending dropping and unemployment ticking up. Japan's move comes only two days after the U.S. Federal Reserve brought an end to its own bond-buying program. Investors have been hopeful that the European Central Bank might also start buying bonds to stimulate that region's economy by keeping interest rates low and injecting cash into the financial system. That form of stimulus is called quantitative easing, also known among investors as 'QE.' A man walks past an electronic stock board of a securities firm in Tokyo on Friday. Japan's Nikkei 225 stock average surged 5 per cent and the yen slid against the dollar after the Bank of Japan unexpectedly announced new stimulus to boost a flagging economic recovery . 'The Japanese central bank has taken the QE baton from the Fed, and equity traders couldn't be happier,' said David Madden, market analyst at IG. Japan's stock market rose 4.8 percent to the highest level since 2007. The Japanese currency weakened dramatically following the Bank of Japan's announcement. The yen slumped 2.6 percent against the dollar to 112 yen. The yen is trading at the lowest level in more than five years. Japanese companies typically like a weak Japanese yen because it makes their exported goods cheaper abroad. European stock markets rose broadly following the Bank of Japan's announcement on hopes that the ECB could be tempted to follow Japan's lead in stepping up stimulus measures. However, few think anything will be announced at the ECB's next policy meeting next Thursday. 'The willingness of the Bank of Japan to ease further in the fight against deflation will encourage those who think the ECB should be doing the same,' said Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics. Britain's FTSE 100 rose 1.3 percent. France's CAC 40 jumped 2.2 percent and Germany's DAX climbed 2.3 percent. In the U.S., GoPro jumped $9.84, or 14 percent, to $78.06. The maker of small, wearable video cameras posted profit and revenue that was well ahead of analysts' projections. The company also raised its profit forecast for the fourth quarter. The price of U.S. benchmark crude oil fell 62 cents to $80.50 a barrel in New York as increasing production from OPEC members added to already high global supplies of oil. Brent crude, used to price oil in international markets, dipped 84 cents to $86.28 in London. Bond prices fell. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.34 percent from 2.31 percent Thursday. In metals trading, the price of gold fell $27 to $1,171.60 an ounce. Silver fell 31 cents to $16.11 an ounce and copper fell 2 cents to $3.05 a pound.","The Dow Jones industrial average rose 168 points, or 1 per cent, to 17,361 near close on Friday .

"A comedian who began her career by telling jokes to her dying sister has now been crowned Britain's top woman comic. Jayde Adams, 29, was asked by her sister Jenna Adams to keep everyone in high spirits after she was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour. So Ms Adams, originally from Bristol, started telling jokes at her sister's hospital bedside. Scroll down for video . Jayde Adams (left), 29, began her career by telling jokes to her dying sister Jenna (right) and has now won a coveted comedian award . When her sister died two years later, Ms Adams felt inspired to carry on making people laugh and decided to forge a new career. Now, after two years on the stand-up circuit, Ms Adams has won the coveted Funny Women Award 2014. Ms Adams, who now lives in London, said: 'When I got to the hospital, Jenna asked me to tell jokes because she said ""everyone is looking at me like I'm going to die"". 'She couldn't handle the pressure of making people sad. 'When my sister died, I was determined. I had this new sense of responsibility to live not just my own life, but hers as well. 'She started me on this career path, no doubt about it. That's really when I became aware of comedy, when she asked me to make some jokes at her hospital bedside, to distract us all from the illness. 'She would be so proud of what I am doing. All I'm told is how proud she would be of me by family and her friends.' After her diagnosis, Ms Adams' sister was treated at Frenchay Hospital in Bristol. She married and moved to Portsmouth in 2009, where she died two years later, aged 28. Soon after, Ms Adams began performing, incorporating jokes, rap, beat-boxing, dance and even opera singing into her shows. Ms Adams, originally from Bristol but who now lives in London, was crowned the winner of the Funny Women Award 2014 . One of her acts in the semi-final of the competition involved pretending to be an Asda fishmonger - a job she used to do . She said: 'Before that, I was at university but I wasn't getting where I wanted to be. It all come together for me after that happened. 'I always looked up to her because everyone loved her. It was a different experience, watching her become ill and deteriorate, and it shaped my work. 'People say you are what you eat but I don’t remember eating a goddess.' Speaking with a thick Bristolian accent: 'I ain't from round these parts... I'm from China.' Doing a send-up of Adele, she says: ''ave you ’eard ’ow meaningful my lyrics are? Does anybody actually know what a Skyfall is?” 'Why is a cat like a comma? Because with a comma the clause comes before the pause and with a cat the paws comes from the claws.' 'I use things from all aspects of my life now to make people laugh. Sometimes, as my comedy is banter based, if a similar situation arises I will talk about her and it. 'While comedians try to see the funny side in everything, it is still really tough.' Like any comedian, Ms Adams started her cabaret-style shows in smaller venues, touring pubs and clubs. But when her boss insisted she started calling herself a comedian, her confidence grew. Ms Adams, who used to be a fishmonger at Asda, performed in the final of the award last month at the Leicester Square Theatre in London. Her winning performance included a rendition of Nessun Dorma in a nude suit. Previous winners of the award - which was launched in 2003 - include Zoe Lyons, Andi Osho, Katherine Ryan and Gabby Best. Jenna died in 2011, aged 28. Ms Adams is putting her prize money from the competition back into a campaign to raise money for Brain Tumour Support UK . Ms Adams said winning the award has shown just how far she has come since being at her sister's bedside. She said: 'Getting this award is an honour, it a massive deal. Women who have won it in the past have gone on to great things. 'I think it has made my parents really proud, and distracted us all a bit from the sadness in the past. She won a £2,000 prize, which she is putting back into a campaign to raise money for Brain Tumour Support UK. Inspired by her sister's experience, she wants to start her own charity. She said: 'This is a massive part of why I want to get a bigger profile. When someone dies you feel very useless. This has allowed me and my mum to feel less useless. 'I would like to bring comedy to people. You can't always force comedy on people but there is a saying that laughter is the best medicine. 'I had someone come up to me the other day who was suffering and they said I was the first person who has made them laugh in the last year and that felt special.' Ms Adams has been raising money for the charity for the past two years. She and her mother Gail are now organising a comedy and dancing gig following the Jenna Adams Charity Ball on November 22. It will raise money for Brain Tumour Support UK and the Epilepsy Society.

"Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe today sent a ritual offering to a controversial shrine in a move likely to impact on his plans to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping. A group of other Japanese lawmakers were also seen paying their respects at the Yakukuni Shrine - condemned by China and Korea as honouring Japan's militarist past - to mark the start of the country's autumn festival. There was no sign of cabinet ministers there, although local media said Health Minister Yasuhisa Shiozaki also sent an offering. A ruling party lawmaker tweeted that three ministers planned to visit the shrine tomorrow. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has risked angering China by sending an offering to Tokyo's controversial Yasukuni Shrine, which they have demanded the leader not visit in person . Expectations have been growing in Japan that Abe, who outraged Beijing and Seoul by visiting Yasukuni in person in December 2013, will be able to meet Xi for talks next month at an Asia-Pacific leaders' summit in Beijing. Signs of improving relations have been growing as both sides recognise the impact their fallout has on business and the risk it could escalate militarily. Prospects for a leaders' chat are clouded by China's demands that Abe not visit the shrine - where Japanese wartime leaders convicted as war criminals by an Allied tribunal are honoured along with millions of war dead. Abe today sent an offering of a small masakaki tree. A promise not to visit Yasukuni again would be difficult for Abe, whose conservative agenda includes recasting Japan's wartime history in a less apologetic tone. Abe has previously said he visited the shrine not to glorify war, but to honour those who fought and died for their country. Abe it thought to be unlikley to visit the shrine ahead of the Asia-Pacific leaders summet in November where he hopes to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping to improve relations between the two countries . But since visiting in December last year, he has stayed away, and instead sent an offering on key dates, in an effort to improve relations with China. Koichi Hagiuda, a ruling Liberal Democratic Party aide to Abe, said the prime minister was likely to refrain from visiting the shrine ahead of the November gathering in Beijing because it was in Japan's national interests. China also wants Japan to acknowledge the existence of a formal territorial dispute over tiny islands in the East China Sea controlled by Japan but also claimed by Beijing. Chinese President Xi Jinping also wants Japan to acknowledge the existence of a formal territorial dispute over tiny islands in the East China Sea controlled by Japan but also claimed by Beijing . Japanese diplomatic experts ruled out such a move but said it was possible the two sides could find a diplomatic formula to 'agree to disagree' over the uninhabited islands, known as the Senkaku in Japan and the Diaoyu in China. A slowing Chinese economy and a sharp drop in Japanese investment are key factors prompting Beijing to rethink its relations with Tokyo, experts said. Japanese firms' investment in China fell 40 per cent on an annual basis in the first half of 2014 after sliding by nearly one-fifth last year. Reduced tensions would also benefit Japanese companies doing business in China. A meeting with Xi would be a diplomatic coup for Abe who has travelled to around 50 countries since taking office, but has so far been unable to meet Chinese or South Korean leaders. Abe has also signalled that he wants to meet South Korean President Park Geun-hye at November's leaders summit. Persistent disputes over the legacy of Japan's 1910-1945 colonisation of the Korean peninsula have cast doubts on the likelihood of such a meeting. China-Japan relations have been strained since the 1937 Nanking Massacre and what China sees as Japan's refusal to acknowledge the extent of what happened there. Japanese soldiers murdered tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands, of Chinese soldiers and civilians during the Second Sino-Japanese War, and were accused of raping local women and widespread looting. Estimates of the death-toll range from 40,000 to 300,000, but revisionists in Japan have contended it is much lower, and even that the event was entirely fabricated. China sees the denial to acknowledge the extent of the massacre and Japan's reluctant to apologise as insensitive.","Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe sent a a tree to the Yasukui Shrine .

"Standing tall: Chloe Hooper, 12, broke her back in May but is now fully recovered . A paralysed girl  who broke her back when she fell nearly 20ft from a tree has astounded doctors with her recovery – thanks to titanium rods screwed  into her spine. Chloe Hooper’s parents feared  she would never walk again after the accident at a Scout camp. The fall shattered a bone in her back and left another pressing against her spine. The injury was so serious that her spine would have collapsed if she had tried to stand up. Chloe underwent a remarkable  90-minute procedure which is similar to one routinely offered to patients with scoliosis – an abnormal curvature of the back. Princess Eugenie suffered from scoliosis  and had surgery lasting eight hours to correct it in 2002. Chloe and Eugenie, who were  both treated at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital (RNOH) in Middlesex, ‘swapped notes’ when the 12-year-old schoolgirl was introduced to the Princess at a charity dinner six weeks after her operation. Eugenie is patron of an  RNOH appeal to raise £15 million  to redevelop its site. Chloe’s mother Julie, 45, from Rayleigh, Essex, reveals: ‘It was amazing meeting Princess Eugenie, who told us all about her operation. Chloe has been so brave through everything. 'We had feared the worst, so when we saw her walk again it was such an emotional moment.’ Chloe’s astonishing recovery gives hope to the 1,000 Britons a year paralysed by spinal cord injuries. The spinal column is made up of vertebrae, and it relays messages from the brain around the body. People can end up paralysed if the spinal cord is crushed and a patient doesn’t receive surgery promptly –for example if they’re left trapped for hours after an accident. Fortunately, Chloe was in the operating theatre within hours of her fall in May. When she fell, she was acting as ‘lookout’ for her friends who were enjoying a water fight below her. The branch she was sitting on snapped suddenly, sending Chloe hurtling to the ground, and she landed on her back. Julie and her husband Simon, 43,  a paramedic for the London Ambulance Service, rushed to the Scout camp, which was just minutes from their home. Julie says: ‘Chloe was talking but complaining that her legs felt funny – she was getting shocks through her feet and her nerve endings felt on fire. ‘Simon did a quick assessment, then called an ambulance. I just keep telling myself, “As long as she’s alive.” ’ Royal friend: Chloe met Princess Eugenie, who underwent the same type of surgery to treat scoliosis in 2002, at a charity dinner six weeks after her operation . The youngster was taken to a local hospital before being referred to the RNOH for specialist treatment. An MRI and CT scan confirmed that she had fractured one of the 12 vertebrae that make up the spine in the upper back and provide structure for the rib cage. A section of bone was also pressing on the part of the spinal cord responsible for muscle and bladder control. ‘Chloe is incredibly lucky,’ says Robert Lee, a consultant spinal surgeon at the RNOH. ‘She broke the oval segment of bone that surrounds the spinal cord. It’s a bit like squashing a grape – bits fly out everywhere and if you tried to stand, your spine would collapse. ‘Patients who come in like this  can be paralysed straight away or develop paralysis afterwards. 'Chloe had only partial paralysis  but there was still a risk that she  could deteriorate.’ She was given a general anaesthetic, then very carefully rolled on to her front, a manoeuvre that involved six people to ensure no further damage to her spine. Straight up: The X-ray image shows the titanium rods which were screwed into Chloe's spine where they will remain for the rest of her life . Medics then rigged Chloe up to a special machine which checks that the nerves in the spinal cord are functioning normally during surgery. Next, an incision was made down the middle of her back, before eight 12in titanium screws were positioned along the spine in pairs – one on each side – including where the bone was fractured. They were screwed into the bone to support and strengthen the vertebrae. Mr Lee also inserted two 3.5in titanium rods vertically down either side of Chloe’s spine. A screw was used to secure those rods in place at each point along the spine – doctors tightened them using a special wrench to correct the fracture. The surgical team also took away a small portion of bone from the spine to reduce pressure on Chloe’s back. The schoolgirl was walking the day after the operation with the  help of a physiotherapist, and discharged a week after surgery. The rods and screws will remain in her back for life and she relies on friends to carry her school bag, but otherwise she has made a full recovery. To thank doctors, her family are now raising funds for the RNOH. Her father Simon said: ‘We never dreamed Chloe would make a full recovery.

"A man who was once severely obese has shed 390lbs and is now running half marathons. Brian Flemming, from Canton, Michigan, has undergone a dramatic transformation since 2012, when he weighed 625lbs. The 32-year-old completed his first half-marathon on July 28, 2013, and is currently gearing up for the Detroit Free Press Half Marathon on Sunday. Runner's high: Brian Flemming, from Canton, Michigan, has shed 390lbs and is now running half marathons . Mr Flemming, a music instructor, has run nine 5K races and four 10Ks. 'Hopefully, next time this year I'll be running the full marathon,' he told Detroit Free Press. Before he began his weight loss journey, Mr Flemming was pre-diabetic and had been struggling with depression and alcoholism, drinking a fifth of vodka mixed with a liter of soda each night. 'My typical fast-food meal was a double cheeseburger with a large pop and large fries,' Flemming wrote on his blog. Before:  The 32-year-old weighed 625lbs in 2012 and struggled with alcoholism and depression . 'That usually wasn't enough, so I would have chicken nuggets with it as well. I also ate Arby's frequently. Large roast beef sandwich, large curly fries and drink, and a side of mozzarella sticks. I ate fast food every day,' he added. In spring 2012, Mr Flemming was playing Draw Something, a Pictionary-inspired app, which randomly matched him with Jackie Eastham, a woman 20 years his senior in London. He began chatting with Ms Eastham, who has myotonic muscular dystrophy, a condition that causes progressive wasting of the muscles and other symptoms. To the finish line: Mr Flemming, a music instructor, has run nine 5K races and four 10Ks . To manage her condition, Eastham follows an extremely healthy lifestyle, and never takes her well-being for granted. A friendship grew, and Mr Flemming began to confide in her about his weight problems, and about his drinking, a secret he'd kept even from his parents. He was expecting sympathy, but was thrown by her response. Biggest supporter: Mr Fleming was encouraged to get healthy by Jackie Eastham (right), a woman in London he met online. The pair began a Facebook group, Team 383, to motivate others to achieve their weight loss goals, and hosted an event together in Michigan last month . 'She told me that I was wasting my life and that I should be ashamed that I was throwing it away when there are so many people out there who are fighting to stay alive,' Mr Flemming wrote. 'My future is a lot gloomier. I'm trying to make the brightest future I can, and... you're dragging yourself down,' Ms Eastham told CNN she recalls thinking. On October 13, 2012, he made the decision to quit drinking cold-turkey, and drastically change his diet. Fitness pals: Mr Flemming and Ms Eastman (pictured at Hampton Court Palace) met in person  when he traveled to London last December . He eventually began walking in place for five minutes. 'I did it little by little,' Mr Flemming said. 'I started walking outside and could barely make it around the block and I added to that little by little. Eventually I walked my first mile.' With Ms Eastham cheering him on by phone, he got to the point where he was walking five miles every morning. 'I dropped 100 pounds over three months. It came off really fast. I was over 350 pounds still when I started running in little increments at a time,' he said. Looking good: Mr Flemming hopes to be running a full marathon by this time next year . He also began cycling 44 miles to and from work every Friday. He and Ms Eastham began a Facebook group, Team 383, to motivate others to achieve their weight loss goals. Now preparing for his second half-marathon, Mr Flemming has a new outlook on life and even took a trip to London last December to meet his biggest supporter. While there, he and Ms. Eastham traveled to Paris together and climbed the Eiffel Tower. 'In 18 months, I went from being able to barely climb stairs to climbing the Eiffel Tower,' he said.","Brian Flemming, from Canton, Michigan, weighed 625lbs just two years ago .

"The U.S. objected Wednesday to Iran's anticipated selection of a former hostage-taker at the American Embassy in Tehran as its newest ambassador to the United Nations. But the Obama administration stopped short of saying it would refuse him a visa to enter the United States. State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf called the potential nomination of Hamid Aboutalebi 'extremely troubling' and said the U.S. has raised its concerns with Tehran. Lawmakers in Congress who usually disagree on everything — ranging from liberal New York Democrat Sen. Chuck Schumer and conservative Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz — have demanded that Aboutalebi be barred from living and working in the United States. But Harf noted that except in limited cases, the U.S. is generally obligated to admit the chosen representatives of member states to U.N. headquarters in New York. Unpopular decision: Iranian President Hassan Rouhani (pictured) is set to appoint Hamid Aboutalebi as the country's ambassador to the UN. Aboutalebi participated in the U.S. hostage crisis of the late 1970s, early 1980s . Dark time: Aboutalebi was part of a Muslim group that stormed the U.S. Embassy in 1979, taking 52 Americans hostage for 444 days . 'We're taking a close look at the case now, and we've raised our serious concerns about this possible nomination with the government of Iran,' Harf told reporters. She added: 'But we do take our obligations as host nation for the United Nations very seriously.' Hamid Babaei, a spokesman for Iran's Mission to the United Nations, said Wednesday, 'It has been a usual practice in the Iranian Foreign Ministry to formally announce and appoint ambassadors — to all foreign postings — once all the formalities are completed.' Aboutalebi was a member of a Muslim student group that stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. He reportedly has insisted that his involvement in the group — Muslim Students Following the Imam's Line — was limited to translation and negotiation. But lawmakers have derided Aboutalebi as a terrorist and a key conspirator in the hostage crisis, and warned that his nomination would escalate tensions in already delicate negotiations aimed at curbing Tehran's nuclear program. 'Deliberately insulting and contemptuous': U.S. Senators Chuck Schumer (left) and Ted Cruz (right) have both voiced their displeasure in Aboutalebi's appointment . In a letter Wednesday to Secretary of State John Kerry, Schumer said Aboutalebi's association with the student group should make him ineligible for a visa or diplomatic immunity in the U.S. 'This man has no place in the diplomatic process,' Schumer said in a separate statement. 'Iran's attempt to appoint Mr. Aboutalebi is a slap in the face to the Americans that were abducted, and their families. It reveals a disdain for the diplomatic process and we should push back in kind.' Earlier this week, Cruz questioned the wisdom of negotiating with the Iranian government in light of what he called its ""deliberately insulting and contemptuous"" choice for U.N. ambassador. The nuclear negotiations are set to resume next week in Vienna. Harf insisted the nuclear talks and the U.N. envoy were separate issues, even as she noted Washington's ongoing concerns with Iran on multiple fronts. 'On the nuclear issue, they have upheld their commitments,' Harf said. 'We hope they will continue to.'","Iran announced its intention to appoint Hamid Aboutalebi as their next envoy to the United Nations .

"A British father who fled the country two decades ago after a bitter divorce left him suicidal has resurfaced - as a Siberian peasant. Michael Ware, originally from Exmoor, chose a dramatic change of lifestyle when he went to live in the far-flung village of Dubinka, three time-zones east of Moscow. Mr Ware, now 55, flew to Russia months after the fall of the Soviet Union and married a local girl, Tatiana, then 18. Siberian family: Michael Ware, 55, wife Tatiana and children Veronika, 16, and Alexander, 18 . Michael Ware's fellow villagers say they can no longer tell him apart from anyone else . Locals say they can no longer tell him apart from anyone else, but the farmer left one very important part of his life behind in Somerset - three children from his first marriage. He said that missing his children was . his only sorrow about his life in a land where temperatures this week . are forecast to sink below -40C. He adopted his new wife's son from a previous relationship, Nikolai, and they had two more children together - Alexander, 18, and Veronika, 16. Now 19, Nikolai has just completed his conscription in the Russian army. Mr Ware, known as Mikhail, has 40 sheep, 14 cows, ten hens and chickens, and two pigs, on the modest smallholding he runs with his wife. Some years, he has a horse for ploughing. The village, population 15, lies 50km down a dirt track that is impassable for much of the year. Isolated: Michael Ware, 55, lives in Siberia with Russian wife Tatiana in a tiny village that is inaccessible for most of the year . Part of the scenery: The remote village has only 15 inhabitants, who say they can no longer see any difference between themselves and the Englishman .

Content: Mr Ware says he loves 'beautiful' Siberia for its long winter, mild summer and fresh air . Mr Ware adopted his second wife's son Nikolai from her first marriage. At 19 he has just completed his conscription in the Russian army . 'In winter, our day starts at 8am and ends at 11pm to midnight,' said Mr Ware. 'Shovelling snow, cutting firewood, . looking after the cows and and sheep, it takes all day. The only free . days I get are if I'm sick.' For years, he performed these tasks wearing his warm Royal Mail woollen hat, one of his few concessions to his British roots. He insists he will stay in his cold paradise for the rest of his life, but says he remains British. 'I certainly have no regrets coming to . Siberia, not at all, though I would like to see my friends and family . more often,' he told the Siberian Times. 'There have been some hardships, but I'm happy here. Now Siberia is my home. 'It's beautiful, a long winter with lots . of sunshine and a nice mild summer. 'Plenty of clean fresh air. Many . beautiful places. It's just a pity that I don't have much time to visit . all of them. I went to the Altai Mountains and like them very much. 'I . still haven't been to Lake Baikal but plan to go there soon.

"Former Cabinet Minister Chris Huhne today lost his appeal against being asked to pay £77,750 towards his prosecution costs . Former cabinet minister Chris Huhne was today ordered to pay £77,750 towards the cost of prosecuting him for passing speeding points to his ex-wife. Mr Huhne had launched an appeal against the bumper bill ordered in May – but three judges today threw out his case. Prosecutors had originally demanded more than £100,000 from Mr Huhne, who pleaded guilty last February. His former wife, the economist Vicky Pryce, who was convicted by a jury, was ordered to pay £49,200. Mr Huhne and Ms Pryce served prison sentences for perverting the course of justice after she took speeding points for her then-husband in 2003. The speeding points scandal brought about the end of Mr Huhne's political career, forcing him to stand down as a cabinet minister and later to resign as an MP. At the conclusion of the hearing, Mr Huhne, 60, was ordered to pay an extra £1,279 prosecution costs relating to the appeal court proceedings. Mr Huhne's had insisted the sum the judge ordered him to pay was 'unjust', but the court said the £77,000 costs were 'just and reasonable'. Oliver Glasgow, defending the prosecution, said Mr Huhne 'sought to play the system and lost'. He told the court it was a 'gamble he took', and 'he knew if he lost it would cost him dearly'. Mr Huhne admitted last year asking Pryce to take his speeding points to avoid losing his licence, and Pryce was convicted of having agreed to do so. The pair were charged over an incident in March 2003 when Huhne's BMW car was caught by a speed camera on the M11 motorway between Stansted Airport in Essex and London. He was an MEP at the time and in danger of losing his licence, having already accrued nine penalty points. Mr Huhne, pictured with his new partner Carina Trimingham (left), was ordered to pay an extra £1,279 on top of the original court order to pay £77,750 towards the cost of his prosecution. His ex wife Vicky Pryce was told to pay just under £50,000 . Mr Huhne, pictured outside Southwark Crown Court last year, was found guilty of perverting the course of justice over speeding points a decade ago . The costs order was made in May by Mr Justice Sweeney at Southwark Crown Court, who rejected Huhne's legal team's original offer of £25,000. Pryce, who was convicted by a jury last year, was ordered to pay £49,200. During Pryce's trial, the prosecution alleged that she had chosen to take the points but later plotted to expose Huhne after he revealed he was having an affair with an aide and ended the couple's 26-year marriage.","Former Lib Dem minister found guilty of passing points to his wife last year .

"Rich Americans are donating less to charity in the wake of the recession - while the poorest in the country are giving more. A report by the Chronicle of Philanthropy found that Americans earning at least  $200,000 a year cut their charitable donations by 4.6 per cent between 2006 and 2012. Meanwhile, those who took home $25,000 or less - the poorest Americans - increased their giving by nearly 17 per cent over the same period. In general, low and middle-income Americans dug deeper than their wealthier counterparts post-recession. The report found that those who made less than $100,000 gave five per cent more in 2012 than they did in 2006. 'Lower and middle-income people know people who lost their jobs or are homeless, and they worry that they themselves are a day away from losing their jobs,' explained Stacy Palmer, editor of the The Chronicle of Philanthropy. 'They're very sensitive to the needs of other people and recognize that these years have been hard.' But it seems that those at the other end of the scale are less inclined to be generous when times are tough economically. Ms Palmer explained that higher-income people tend to give proportionately less during times of recession. 'The downturn was a shock to so many of them, and they've been nervous and cautious,' she said. However, rich Americans still gave more in absolute terms between 2006 and 2012, increasing their donations  by $4.6 billion to $77.5 billion, using inflation-adjusted dollars. The study found that Americans give, on average, about 3 per cent of their income to charity, a figure that has not shifted significantly for decades. Overall, Americans donated $180 billion to charity in 2012, with the sharpest drops in giving found in the United States' biggest cities. The steepest declines from across the nation  were in Philadelphia and Buffalo, New York, where the share of income donated fell by more than 10 per cent. Those in Los Angeles, Minneapolis-St. Paul, and Washington, D.C., were also significantly less generous when it came to charity, with declines of more than 9 per cent. Utah residents were the most generous across the United States, donating $65.60 to charity for every $1,000 earned. Salt Lake City was the most philanthropic city, with residents donating more than five per cent of their incomes to charitable causes. This was largely due to the large population of Mormons, who are urged to donate a significant proportion of their incomes to charity, the report noted . Salt Lake City was the most philanthropic city, with residents donating more than 5 per cent of their incomes to charitable causes. This was largely due to the large population of Mormons, who are urged to donate a significant proportion of their incomes to charity, the report noted. 'The Mormon tradition of tithing is a primary reason residents of (Utah) well outpace those in every other place in America,' it said. New Hampshire was the least philanthropic state, with residents donating $17.40 of every $1,000 earned. North Dakota residents gave 16 per cent less, making it the state with the greatest fall, with $24 donated for every $1,000 earned. The steepest declines from across the nation drops were in Philadelphia and Buffalo, New York (pictured), where the share of income donated fell by more than 10 per cent . Out of the 50 largest cities, Las Vegas saw the highest climb in charitable giving, with residents donating nearly 15 per cent more of their incomes to charities in 2012. At a state level, Nevada also saw the fastest-growing rate of charitable donations. Just behind Nevada, the states that experienced the biggest growth in the share of giving were Idaho, Georgia, Connecticut, and Florida. Ms Palmer noted that the shift in charitable giving, with the wealthy donating less, is likely to mean less cash flowing into universities, hospitals and cultural institutions, which richer Americans tend to patronize. Lower and middle-income donors tend to be more inclined to donate to social service organizations. But she added that in part because these groups have had fewer dollars to give, those organizations still faced a squeeze during the recession.","Those making at least $200,000 cut donations 4.6 per cent from 2006 to 2012 .

"Last week Gemma Ward took the modelling world by storm with her surprise return to the catwalk, after a six-year hiatus following the death of rumoured boyfriend Heath Ledger. Her comeback  at Milan Fashion Week was watched from afar by her mother, Claire Ward, who said she became quite emotional. The 26-year-old Australian opened Prada's Spring/Summer 2015 show wearing a long navy coat and knee-high grey socks, causing a storm of support from critics and fans alike. 'I must admit I had a tear in my eye when she walked out,' Mrs Ward told The West Australian. Scroll down for video . The 26-year-old Australian opened Prada's Spring/Summer 2015 show wearing a long navy coat and knee-high grey socks, causing a storm of support from critics and fans alike. The model, who was named as the top ten highest earning model by Forbes in 2007 gave birth to her first child, a daughter named Naia, last year. 'I just felt really pleased for her. It was an important thing for her to come back: she loved modelling, she loves fashion and it just was the right time.' 'I'd spent a very anxious week leading up to it. The fashion industry is very fickle and you never really know.' Ward's return to the modelling world had been highly anticipated since she signed back on to the books of agency IMG Models. The Perth beauty has been modelling since she was 15, and was reportedly paid $20,000 per catwalk at the height of her career, walking for iconic brands including Calvin Klein, Burberry and Valentino. At the time of Heath Ledger's death, the pair were reported to have been dating, and Ward was seemingly shaken by his sudden demise from an accidental drug overdose. 'There was no one like him and no one will ever be like him.'I'm just so grateful I got to meet him and get as close as I did with him,' Ward said of Ledger . Ward took 'a break from the media spotlight for the past few years and it was something spurred by Heath's death.' '(Heath and I) first met in New York and we were both struggling with things that I won't get into, and we bonded over that,' Ward told The Herald Sun. 'There was no one like him and no one will ever be like him.'I'm just so grateful I got to meet him and get as close as I did with him.' For Ward, retreating from the world of modelling was a 'reassessment of everything...a commitment to myself to address some things that were coming up to do with Heath's passing and also things that were troubling me before we met.' 'So it was a retreat from many things in my life and I did think it was important for me to focus on those things.' 'I didn't know how long it would take. I didn't know if it would solve anything, but I set out to focus inside myself.' Despite the pain of losing Ledger, the model's mum knew it was only a matter of time before the flawless beauty was back. 'If the fashion industry embraces her like it did before, and if Gemma can work in a way that has some balance with family life and it doesn't get too frantic, I think it would be amazing,' said the model's mother . Despite the pain of losing Ledger, the model's mum knew it was only a matter of time before the flawless beauty was back. 'She got to see that if she chose to she could have a very normal life,' Mrs Ward said. 'I always knew she wanted to go back - she had unfinished business. It was kind of hard leaving when she did, she needed to go and spend some time for herself.' The model, who was named as the top ten highest earning model by Forbes in 2007 gave birth to her first child, a daughter named Naia, last year. 'She's always been very professional and now she's an adult, she's a mother and I think she really has grown into someone who can see the value of her work,'Mrs Ward said. 'If the fashion industry embraces her like it did before, and if Gemma can work in a way that has some balance with family life and it doesn't get too frantic, I think it would be amazing.' 'I think she has a voice now, she's a mature woman and is able to say no.' Ward's return to the catwalk saw many in the industry excited . 'The industry tells you that the life of a model is very short and you have to say yes to everything and, unfortunately, that's why girls maybe do things that they wouldn't do if they sat back and thought about it.' Since retiring in 2008, Ward has appeared in several films and plays, including a role in BAFTA-winning film The Black Balloon, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, and Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby. 'It's nice to be in a position where you can pick and choose, which I think Gemma's been able to do. She's said no to an awful lot in the last number of years,' said Mrs Ward. 'Her partner (model David Letts) had never been to Europe before and it was his birthday the day before (the show), so she said 'even if it doesn't come off it'll be a beautiful experience for David on his birthday'.' Christine Fox, director of Vivien's Model Management, who first signed Ward in Perth, said she was 'very excited'. 'I think we were all quietly hoping she would make a comeback,' she said. 'Gemma's comeback could not have been planned any better with opening for Prada . . . she nailed it.'","Ward retired from modelling in 2008 after the sudden death of then-boyfriend Heath Ledger .

"Cats have nine lives, so the old adage goes. Which perhaps explains how this adorable kitten managed to find safety under the axle of a Range Rover - despite dodging through rush-hour traffic on a busy dual carriage way. The black cat was found shoehorned into the narrow space above the vehicle's wheel arch after dicing with death on the A40 near Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire. This black kitten, now nicknamed Axle, caused a ten-minute standstill on a busy A-road after having to be rescued from under the axle of a Range Rover . The adorable cat, pictured left and right, had climbed into the narrow space after dodging across the A40 in rush-hour traffic this morning . Motorists watched in amazement as the cat - now dubbed 'Axle' - darted across four lines of road, weaving in and out of the traffic, at 9am today. The young cat was found cowering in the narrow space - and prompted a ten-minute delay as police launched a rescue. The cat  is now looking for a new home. A spokesman for the Central Motorway Police Group (CMPG) said: 'At 9am the kitten ran onto the busy dual carriageway of the A40 near the Ross services and hid underneath a Range Rover where he had to be rescued by officers from West Mercia Police and CMPG. 'They've dubbed him Axle given that he was found hiding in the rear differential.

The little kitten, pictured with PC Lacey from CMPG,  is now looking for a new home . 'It ran across the dual track at about 9am bringing traffic to a halt before hiding in another vehicle. 'The road was blocked for about 10 minutes whilst officers, including PC Karl Lacey, rescued the kitten from underneath the Range Rover.' Pc Lacey, of CMPG, said: 'It is possible the cat had crawled into another car which had then pulled onto the garage forecourt at the services. 'It was then seen running across the forecourt onto the dual carriageway where it hid under the axle of the Range Rover which had stopped in traffic.' Motorist Alan Redding, 23, was driving to work when he saw the kitten come within inches of being mown down. He said: 'I saw a flash of black and realised it was a tiny kitten darting between the cars. It is a miracle it wasn't flattened. 'Thankfully, it had a happy ending but no doubt used up a bulk of its nine lives. 'Luckily the car it hid under wasn't moving otherwise it could have been a different story.' The kitten was taken to nearby Chaseview Vets while attempts were being made to find its owners.","The black kitten was spotted on the A40 near Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire .

"The web was awash last week of claims that Apple’s latest iPhone 6 Plus handset bends when stored in a pocket too long. However, experts from Consumer Reports suggest that some of these claims may have been exaggerated. During their own stress tests, they found the iPhone 6 Plus can withstand more force than has been previously claimed - and that it is more sturdy than the HTC One (M8) and the smaller iPhone 6. Consumer Reports used a ‘three-point flexural’ device (pictured) to put the handsets through a stress test. Despite claims made last week that the iPhone 6 Plus bends easily when left in a pocket too long, the phone outperformed the HTC One (M8) and iPhone 6 - and was able to withstand more force than previously claimed . This chart reveals how much force each handset could withstand. 'Deformation' refers to the point at which the phone began to bend. 'Case separation' was the point at which the display became disconnected from the case. The first reports of bendy iPhones began on Wednesday last week when photos appeared online showing the top of the device bent out of shape. YouTube user Lewis Hilsenteger then posted a video showing the iPhone 6 Plus bending using just his fingers, which has already been viewed more than 45.3 million times. To put these claims to the test, Consumer Reports used a so-called ‘three-point flexural test.’ This involved supporting the phone at two points on either end before applying a force on the top of the device. The set-up is said to be similar to the one Apple uses to test its devices before selling them. In addition to the iPhone 6 Plus, the researchers tested the iPhone 6, HTC One (M8), LG G3, Samsung Galaxy Note 3, and the iPhone 5. Despite the claims, the HTC One (M8) and iPhone 6 were the weakest devices. They started to deform and bend when a total of 70lbs (31.75kg) of force was applied. The iPhone 6 Plus came third, at 90lbs (40kg), followed by the LG G3 and iPhone 5 on 130lbs (59kg), and the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 on 150lbs (68kg). The iPhone 6 Plus results show the handset can withstand 15lbs (6.8kg) more force than the initial reports suggested. Consumer Reports claimed this is more than a quarter more force than is needed to break three pencils. 'Impressively, despite some serious damage from our machine, some of the phones continued to work,' said Consumer Reports. 'Several of the screens illuminated and were functional to the touch; we even completed a call from one phone to another. 'While nothing is (evidently) indestructible, we expect that any of these phones should stand up to typical use.' The first reports of bendy iPhones began on Wednesday last week when photos appeared online showing the top of the device bent out of shape. YouTube user Lewis Hilsenteger then posted a video showing the iPhone 6 Plus bending using just his fingers, (screengrab) which has already been viewed more than 45.3 million times . Apple also faced criticism and complaints last week about its iOS 8.0.1 update, after it caused problems with the new phones’ TouchID sensors and data services. The update was pulled, and the problems should now be solved by updating to iOS 8.0.2. Further tests, by AnandTech, revealed the performance of the new phones isn’t as poor as customers have made out, either. During initial benchmark tests, the iPhone 6 was found to have the fastest web browsing and page loading times on any device, just ahead of the iPhone 6 Plus. The iPhone 6 also performed well in graphics testing, coming second with an average frame per second rate of 49.5. This was only behind the NVIDIA Shield tablet, on 57.1. The iPhone 5S was third, on 40.2, followed by the iPhone 6 Plus on 34.4. According to Consumer Reports, the HTC One (M8) (pictured) was the weakest of the handsets tested. It started to deform and bend when a total of 70lbs (31.75kg) of force was applied. This was on par with the iPhone 6. The HTC handset separated from its case when a force of 90lbs (40kg) was applied . The controversy was dubbed 'BendGate'. It led to internet jokers posting photos, mocking the unintended new feature (pictured). A number of these images went viral on social media . Furthermore, the display on the iPhone 6 Plus was praised by experts at DisplayMate, who called the screen ‘the best performing smartphone LCD’ the site has ever tested. Following the reports, and #bendgate controversy on Twitter, Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said: 'With normal use, a bend in iPhone is extremely rare and through our first six days of sale, a total of nine customers have contacted Apple with a bent iPhone 6 Plus,' Apple shares closed down nearly 4 per cent at $97.87 (£60.26) Thursday, wiping out nearly $23billion (£14.1billion) in market value. Further tests, by AnandTech, revealed the performance of the new phones isn’t as poor as customers have made out, either.

"Last week’s by-election results confirmed what many of us in the Labour Party have been thinking for months – that Ed Miliband needs to step down as leader and make way for an election winner. It is not the performance of a Government-in-waiting to scrape a majority of little more than 600 votes in Heywood and Middleton, a previously safe Labour seat. Ed is a decent, intelligent man. That is not in question. Scroll down for video . Former Labour MP Andrew MacKinlay said Ed Miliband must resign if Labour is to win the next election . But – and there is no gentle way of putting this – his leadership is a complete disaster. Yes, if we manage to stay at our current rating of around 35 per cent, then Ed may well become Prime Minister in May. However, recent history demonstrates that this cannot be relied upon. In the 1980s, Labour leaders Michael Foot and Neil Kinnock were also ahead in the polls for much of their time, yet fell short. Ed’s speech to the Labour Party conference last month, when he forgot to mention the deficit, was a train crash. My fear is that his fluff will join Mr Foot’s donkey jacket – when he wore a green coat while placing a wreath on the cenotaph in 1981 – as symbolic of a doomed leadership. Likewise, when Mr Kinnock fell over on Brighton beach, clutching his wife Glenys as he evaded a wave during the 1983 party conference, it became a metaphor for the electoral tsunami that was to come. Despite their flaws, even Foot and Kinnock demonstrated qualities which Ed lacks. Kinnock bravely tackled Militant Tendency and Foot was one the greatest orators of all time. The reason they both lost to Margaret Thatcher was because voters could not imagine either man standing in front of No 10. Ed has the same problem. The Miliband ‘brand’ has failed. I am a traditional, old-fashioned politician who left school at 16, worked for local council and began my political career in the unions. There is no gentle way of putting this but Ed Miliband's leadership of the Labour Party has been a disaster . Both Neil Kinnock, left and Michael Foot, right, both seemed destined to win a general election for Labour . For 18 years as an MP, I represented the solid, working-class seat of Thurrock in Essex. It is now held by the Tories on a wafer-thin majority from Labour, but could be vulnerable to Ukip. Clacton, where Ukip triumphed last week, is only 40 miles down the road. Ed will never appeal to floating voters in such vital marginal seats. He has surrounded himself with too many wet-behind-the-ears advisers and apparatchiks who have never done a real day’s work in their lives. Chief courtier in this dysfunctional set is Douglas Alexander, who combines his role as Shadow Foreign Secretary with heading our General Election strategy team. Douglas was heavily implicated in Gordon Brown’s ‘bottled’ Election U-turn of 2007, ran David Miliband’s failed leadership campaign and played a key role in the pro-union referendum campaign in Scotland, which was floundering until Brown stepped in to save the day. And we are counting on him to deliver victory in 2015. How stupid. Of our elder statesmen, no-nonsense former Home Secretary Alan Johnson or plain-talking ex-Chancellor Alistair Darling would both be better leaders than Ed Miliband. And among younger Labour MPs, Yvette Cooper, Chuka Umunna and Andy Burnham can all, unlike Ed, deliver crisp, cogent – and complete – speeches. Ed, for the sake of the party we both love, please stand aside now.","Former Labour MP Andrew MacKinlay believes Ed Miliband is a liability .

"An artist made a papier-mâché sculpture from comics only to discover that the books were in fact first editions worth about £20,000. The piece of artwork, called Paperboy, was created by Andrew Vickers, 49, from Sheffield, who found the comics for the man-sized statue in a skip. However, after handing the sculpture over to an exhibition he was told the comics, which included a first edition of The Avengers, would have been worth a small fortune. Oops: Andrew Vickers pictured with his sculpture called Paperboy which he created using £20,000 of comics . Comic book expert, Steve Eyre, 52, made the jaw-dropping discovery when he looked at the piece and it began to dawn on him that the pages pasted to the leg of Paperboy were from the classic comic book published by Marvel Comics. Mr Eyre, who also has a first edition of The Avengers which is worth around £10,000, said it would have been cheaper for the jobbing artist to have sculpted it out of Italian marble. He said: 'As I walked round it, on the inside right leg, there was a cover of The Avengers number one. 'I actually did a double take when I saw it. Blunder: Artist Andrew Vickers stands with Steve Eyre who is holding his first edition copy of The Avengers and realised the sculpture had been made from valuable comics . Art for art's sake: The sculpture which Andrew Vickers created unwittingly with £20,000 of comics . 'I’ve got a copy of that, which was published in 1963, and it is worth well over £10,000. 'Then I started looking and there are six other comics on the sculpture that added with the number one would be worth £20,000.' Mr Vickers explained how he came across the valuable books. He said: 'I saw the box in a skip and thought you can’t throw those away. 'If somebody chucks things out in the skip they don’t generally throw things out that are worth anything. 'I didn’t know what I was going to do with them. I just thought they were lovely things. 'I had them for ages until I heard about the exhibition and decided to make a sculpture. Collector's item: Pictured is comic book expert Steve Eyre's copy of The Avengers worth £10,000 . Oh dear: The copy of The Avengers on the right side of the sculpture's leg . Steve Eyre said it would have been cheaper for Andrew Vickers to make the sculpture out of Italian marble . 'Steve said 'wow this is good' and then started walking around saying 'where did you get this one from, where did you get that one from? 'He couldn’t believe it but I think there is no point crying over spilt milk.' Mr Eyre said he couldn’t sleep that night after realising how much the comic books were worth. 'Nothing can be done now but I’m looking to get Jonathan Ross to buy the sculpture, or maybe Nicolas Cage, they both like comics. 'In the end I’ll probably never sell it but it’ll be a great talking point.' Mr Eyre said he couldn’t sleep that night after realising how much the comics were worth . Mr Eyre, who runs Sheffield-based comic business World of Superheroes, added: 'I lost sleep thinking about the sculpture and he built it up from lots of different layers so I dread to think what is underneath. 'It would have been cheaper for Andrew to make this out of Italian marble because the raw materials that have gone in to it, I could have sold for a lot more than he is going to sell this statue for. 'In the end, it is a beautiful thing but Andrew is a talented jobbing artist who hasn’t had his break yet and £20,000 is a lot of money to him. 'I told him later I had loads of comics I could have given him for 10p if he needed them and to call me first if he finds anything else in a skip.'","Artwork was created by Andrew Vickers who found the books in a skip .

"England will continue to develop a nastier and more cynical side to their football as they prepare for clashes with Slovenia and Scotland. Wayne Rooney first noted the problem of England being too soft after the World Cup in Brazil, when he admitted ‘maybe we’re too honest’ compared with more streetwise opponents like Italy and Uruguay. Roy Hodgson and his coaching team have sought to address this during the opening games of the Euro 2016 campaign and vice-captain Gary Cahill believes it is starting to make an impact. England vice-captain Gary Cahill says the Three Lions will continue to develop a nastier side to their game . Cahill says Jose Mourinho at Chelsea has a tendency to play nastier and develop a more cynical approach . ‘We’ve been too nice in the past,’ said Cahill. ‘We’ve got a very young team and it comes with experience, knowing when to slow things down, not to always play out from the back. ‘Everybody has this philosophy of playing from the back from the keeper, but there are times to think, “Hold on, let’s not play out from the back this time, let’s kick it up the front for five or 10 minutes”. ‘There are times to kill it off, or slow things down when things aren’t going well. We will learn that. It’s just managing the game really, which maybe we are doing a lot better. It’s something that has been addressed.’ Cahill receives similar messages from his club manager Jose Mourinho at Chelsea. ‘Jose has been a master of that,’ said the centre back. ‘It’s a part of play at Chelsea and that’s because there are so many experienced players in the squad. ‘People know when to do that and not. That’s something that’s coming into the make-up with England and that’s why we are progressing.’ Cahill: 'It’s a part of play at Chelsea and that’s because there are so many experienced players in the squad' Cahill has become vice-captain of England under manager Roy Hodgson ahead of the match against Slovenia . Cahill was outstanding in the 1-0 away win in Estonia on his last England appearance, shouldering responsibility and stepping out of the back four to get physical with opponents after a series of midfield fouls on Jack Wilshere and Jordan Henderson. ‘We are definitely a lot harder to play against,’ he added. ‘That’s about being physical, wanting to win the ball back, being aggressive and getting tight to the player. ‘It’s more physical than verbal — I don’t think that helps much — but when players are trying to hold the ball up, you’re behind them and they’re thinking, “What’s this guy doing?” That’s when they know they’re in a game.’ Coach and former England right back Gary Neville has been keen to get these points across to those stepping up to the international scene. Cahill added: ‘He was a fantastic player in a great back four and he likes the kind of hard, tough-to-play-against, physical, almost old-school style, whereby you let the attackers or centre forward know they are in a game and feel your presence.’ Cahill, Leighton Baines and Phil Jagielka are part of England's defensive set up and chat during training .","Gary Cahill promises England are continuing to develop their nastier side .

"Electronic ID wristbands could be given to all tourists visiting Thailand, the country's tourism minister has revealed. Kobkarn Wattanavrangkul said the devices would be used to help identify and locate tourists who get lost or into trouble. 'When tourists check in to a hotel they will be given a wristband with a serial number that matches their ID and shows the contact details of the resort they are staying in, so that if they're out partying late and, for example, get drunk or lost, they can be easily assisted,' Kobkarn said. The bodies of David Miller, 24, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, were found on a beach on Koh Tao on September 15 . The last known picture of the pair, together with a group at the sports bar called Choppers - they also went to the AC bar where a group of amateur footballers were celebrating the end of a tournament . The minister said there were plans for these wristbands to eventually incorporate some sort of 'electronic tracking device'. She said a 'buddy system', pairing tourists with a local minder at tourist spots, was also being discussed. But Kobkarn admitted that not everybody was comfortable with the wristband idea. 'Most people welcome the idea but some hotels are concerned that tourists may not want to wear the wristbands.' Concerns have also been raised about the safety of tourists in Thailand following the murder of two Britons. The bodies of David Miller, 24, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, were found on a beach on the holiday isle on September 15. A bloodstained garden hoe, believed to be the murder weapon, was found nearby. Detectives investigating the murders on the island of Kao Tao are hunting for three men - two of whom they say raped the female victim while the third watched. Police have been taking DNA swabs and footprints of people on the island in a bid to find the killers . In the wake of heavy criticism over the investigation into their brutal deaths, police sought to allay fears that the killers had long escaped saying they were 'confident' that a significant breakthrough was on the horizon. 'Two of the suspects raped and killed Witheridge while another one witnessed the murder,' Pol Lt Gen Panya Mamen, commissioner of Provincial Police Region 8, said yesterday. 'We're confident we have a very high chance of finding the suspects,' the senior police officer said. 'I'm not worried [about high public expectations] because I know how much the probe has been progressing. We just have to follow forensic results.' The murders – and Ms Witheridge's suspected rape – were the work of a group of at least three 'attackers', two of whom are Asian men, police have claimed, citing analysis of DNA and other evidence . Police have taken more than 200 DNA samples from men living and working in the area of the crime scene - most of them being migrant workers from Burma. But there have been no matches so far with the victims. A group of Thai footballers are the latest people to be questioned by police amid fears that the hunt for the killers has stalled. A spokesman for the Royal Thai Police confirmed that DNA samples were taken from 'more than eight' footballers - who reportedly threw a late-night party at the AC nightclub where the victims spent their final hours - and officers were awaiting the results. The amateur footballers were allegedly at the nightclub celebrating the end of a tournament while the British backpackers were there. Police have offered a reward of 700,000 baht - roughly £13,300 -  for information which leads to the arrests of the culprits. Dressed in a pink top and white skirt, Hannah Witheridge looked happy and relaxed as she strolled past fruit stands and in and out of bars on the night before her murder . Investigating officers have said they believe sexual jealousy was the motive behind the murder of 23-year-old from Great Yarmouth in the early hours of September 15. A condom has recently been recovered from the crime scene which has the young woman's DNA on its outer skin. Police have already said that DNA recovered from her body has shown that two men took advantage of her on the morning of her death. 'The discovery of the condom is an important piece of evidence,' said provincial police commander General Kiattipong Kaosam-ang. 'Solving this crime is going to come down to DNA matches and we are working hard on this.' Her recently-met friend David Miller, 24, from Jersey died when he was attacked after - it is believed - he went to her aid when he found her in trouble near a group of boulders on the beach. The movements of David Miller and Miss Witheridge are not known afterwards though some locals claim to have seen them in a bar arguing with an Asian man . DNA found on a cigarette matches a sample taken from Miss Witheridge and police say they are hoping that matching it with a suspect would 'open the door' to finding who else was involved. 'There is no doubt the murder of Miss Witheridge was sexually motivated because none of her belongings or those of the English man were missing,' said General Kiattipong Kaosam-ang. 'Yes, the motivation for the attack is rape.' He said the attackers might have been smoking when they saw Miss Witheridge walking back to her guest house alone along the beach. Miss Witheridge's family said they are 'broken' by her death and revealed several days ago that they have returned to the UK with her body. In a statement, they said: 'As a family we feel enormous relief to have Hannah back at home where she belongs. 'We continue to work closely with officers to assist in the investigation and bring those responsible to justice. 'Our family is broken and require time to grieve in private - as do Hannah's many friends.'","Plans for all visitors to be given their own 'electronic tracking device'

"NBC's Nancy Snyderman has been told to 'take some time off' after she broke her Ebola quarantine to visit her favorite soup restaurant. The 62-year-old medical correspondent was ordered to avoid all human contact for 21 days as doctors treated her cameraman Ashoka Mukpo after he contracted the deadly virus in Liberia. Despite this, Dr Snyderman and her team visited the Peasant Grill soup restaurant in New Jersey, sparking fears that Ebola could spread further. Scroll down for video . NBC medical correspondent Nancy Snyderman has been released from her Ebola quarantine but will not return to work until November . Witnesses claimed the physician and broadcaster wore sunglasses with her hair in a ponytail as she pulled up outside the restaurant and a man dashed in to grab the order, according to TMZ. After three weeks, the doctor and her team's quarantine is over, but, instead of returning to the nation's screens, the doctor has been sent home until at least November. A statement from NBC said: 'While in Liberia Dr Nancy and her team delivered first class, first-hand reporting from the front lines of this tragic and monumental story. Their subsequent departure from Monrovia, their return to the U.S. and period of quarantine has been a challenging time. 'We have encouraged them – and they have agreed – to take some time off with their families and friends to help restore some normalcy to their lives. We very much look forward to their return next month.' The statement added that the network were relieved to say that Dr Snyderman and the rest of the crew were 'healthy and symptom-free'. After being put in isolation because her cameraman contracted the deadly Ebola virus, Dr Snyderman came under criticism for breaking her quarantine to visit her favorite soup restaurant in New Jersey . Witnesses claimed the physician and broadcaster wore sunglasses with her hair in a ponytail as she pulled up outside Peasant Grill (pictured) In a televised interview yesterday, Ebola survivor Mr Mukpo gave his first interview in which the journalist revealed he believed 'something isn't right' about his  receiving top notch medical care in America while thousands suffer in Africa, some with no treatment at all. Mukpo told NBC News that he's massively thankful for everything that helped him survive, but he remains careful not to celebrate too soon. 'For me to kind of know that I got sick, and then was so fortunate to receive the kind of care that I got, when so many people have nothing even approximating slightly that kind of care, it's a heavy feeling.' The 33-year-old, who was deemed a 'tulku' — or reincarnated Tibetan Buddhist lama — as an infant clarified that 'guilt' is not the 'right word.' 'But it — it just feels like something isn't right about that,' Mukpo told NBC. The Rhode Island native also detailed to interviewer Kate Snow the physical pain he endured while fighting off Ebola, which continued even as he prepared to finally head home. 'There's definitely some physical effects of this that I think are gonna last a while. But I can feel my strength coming back every day,' he said. 'There was a period of time that I was quite sick. And, you know, I was laying in a hospital bed and had no strength. Had various pains. And — and just all kinds of fun stuff going on in my body.' Going home at last: Ebola survivor Ashoka Mukpo, an NBC freelance cameraman, poses with his father, Dr. Mitchell Levy and his partner Helen Finlay after being discharged from a special unit at the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska on Wednesday . High spirits: Mukpo said he's feeling much better since being declared Ebola-free, but admitted he's got a heavy heart thinking about his privileged level of care compared to the victims he left behind in Liberia . First interview: Muko spoke out on television for the first time Wednesday and detailed his struggle against Ebola and his experience as one of the few Americans who've been treated in the U.S. Thanks to a blood transfusion from Ebola survivor Dr. Kent Brantly and the experimental anti-viral brincidofovir, the fun has just about stopped. However, Mukpo won't admit to any regrets. 'It's not something that I will look back on and say, you know, it was the wrong decision to do,' he told NBC. 'But it's also important to keep yourself safe. So, I mean, it's hard to call Ebola a learning experience. But I think that I'm gonna walk away from this with some important lessons for the future.' Ashoka Mukpo's battle against Ebola officially ended Tuesday as the NBC cameraman tested negative for the deadly virus for the third consecutive day. 'Just got my results. 3 consecutive days negative. Ebola free and feeling so blessed,' the 33-year-old tweeted from his Nebraska hospital bed. Mukpo announced his good news along with a tweet of support to infected Dallas nurses Amber Vinson and Nina Pham as Pham's condition was officially upgraded to 'good.' 'Still thinking about those nurses. Look forward to the day you two get news like this too...,' he wrote before signing off Tuesday evening. Thanking his caregivers: Mukpo is greeted by Biocontainment Unit nursing director Shelly Schwedhelm after being discharged from a special unit at the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha . Lots of love: Mukpo is seen here with his father Dr. Mitchell Levy after being discharged. Mukpo, who contracted the virus while working in West Africa, is the second patient to be successfully treated for Ebola, according to the hospital . University of Nebraska Medical Center's Angela Hewlett MD, left,  Phil Smith MD, center, and Shelly Schwedhelm speak to the media regarding Mukpo on Wednesday. Hospital officials had said Tuesday that Mukpo's blood tested negative for the virus . The Nebraska Medical Center said Tuesday afternoon that Ashoka Mukpo's blood tested negative for the virus. He will be allowed to leave a biocontainment unit Wednesday. Mukpo said in a statement that recovering from Ebola 'is a truly humbling feeling.' For the second day in a row, Mukpo heaped on the praise, thanks and answers to questions so many have had since he was admitted to the specially-equipped ward October 6 after contracting Ebola in Liberia. 'I fought and won, with lots of help. Amazing feeling,' he gushed. The knowledge that there's no more virus in my blood is a profound relief. I'm so lucky. Wish everyone who got sick could feel this.' Mukpo made sure to acknowledge his fellow Americans still fighting their battles against Ebola. Scarier times: Here, Mukpo is seen being wheeled into the Nebraska hospital after flying back to the U.S. from Liberia October 6 . When Ashoka Mukpo was just 8 months old, his father - Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche - announced that the boy was a 'tulku' - the reincarnation of a Tibetan Buddhist Lama. Mr Mukpo later traveled to Tibet, where he was enthroned and honored as the ninth reincarnation of Khamnyon Rinpoche, 'the Mad Yogi of Kham.' A further twist in the cameraman's life: Trungpa, who is considered his father, is not his biological dad. His biological father is actually Mitchell Levy - a Jewish doctor from New York who was Trungpa's personal physician - whom his mother Lady Diana Mukpo was sleeping with at the time. When Ashoka Mukpo was just 8 months old, his father - Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche - announced that the boy was a 'tulku' - the reincarnation of a Tibetan Buddhist Lama . The 33-year-old Mr Mukpo remains a Buddhist. But, despite his wild family history and divine lineage, he has rejected the path of a monk. Instead, he chose a life working for nonprofits and has said his calling is to help alleviate suffering in the world. After his father Trungpa died in 1987, his mother married his biological father, Dr Levy and moved to quiet suburban Providence, Rhode Island. Mr Mukpo's father was a hard-drinking, womanizing Buddhist luminary who founded the first Buddhist monastery in the West and taught the likes of Davie Bowie, Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs and Joni Mitchell in the 1960s and 70s. Chögyam Trungpa was known for his wild, hedonistic Tantric parties that were fueled by drugs, booze and sex. He frequently seduced and slept with his students - claiming that it would help them on their path to enlightenment. Mukpo's girlfriend Helen Finlay had traveled to Nebraska Medical Center, where Ashoka is being treated, along with his parents Dr Mitchell Levy and Lady Diana Mukpo (left) He died at age 48 in 1987 from complications from extreme alcoholism after founding the Kagyu Samye Ling Monastery in Galloway, Scotland, and the Shambhala Mountain Center outside Boulder, Colorado. His mother is Lady Diana Judith Mukpo, born Diana Pybus, the daughter of a wealthy London lawyer. She attended Benenden School, an all-girl's boarding school in Kent, England, where she is thought to have been a contemporary of Princess Anne and Baroness Manningham-Buller, former Director General of MI5. In December 1968, aged 15 and on her Christmas break from Benenden, Diana met 28-year-old Chögyam Mukpo, or Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche as he was known as a lama, at the Buddhist Society in London’s Eccleston Square. In the documentary Tulku, she recalled the first time she laid eyes on the monk, saying: 'I felt like I'd known him for lifetimes. Just immediate, instantaneous lifetime connection. and the rest is history.' She later sneaked out of her boarding school stole into his hotel room that night. She later recalled that she had been hoping that she would end up in bed with him when she introduced herself. Trungpa, who had been having sex since age 13, obliged. Trungpa had traveled to Britain in 1963 on a scholarship to study at Oxford University after fleeing the Chinese occupation of Tibet, and shortly before meeting Diana, he had been teaching David Bowie about Buddhism. In 1970, Diana, just 16 and the Tibetan guru, aged 30, ran away to Scotland to marry. The sensational story of the lawyer's teenage daughter who ran away to marry a monk nearly twice her age became front page news.","Nancy Snyderman has been released from her 21-day Ebola quarantine .

"An airline is complaining that passengers are getting lost and missing their flights because of a lack of road signs helping them find an out-of-the way Hawaii airport. Mokulele Airlines is the first commercial airline to offer service out of a west Oahu airport that's at a former naval air station. On July 1, the airline began offering three roundtrip flights a day to Kahului, Maui, out of the Kalaeloa Airport. 'We've had a lot of no-shows because people miss the flight because they can't find the airport,' said CEO Ron Hansen. Very confusing: There's no sign on the highway for state-owned Kalaeloa Airport and a Hawaii airline says that, along with the winding, confusing road to the west Oahu field leads to many passengers simply missing their flights . There's no airport sign on the freeway, and the road to the airport has a series of merges and turns through some unpopulated areas. Despite the lack of signs, the airline has decided to add more flights from Kalaeloa, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported Monday. Next week, Mokulele plans to begin three daily round trips between Kalaeloa and Hoolehua, Molokai, and two daily round trips between Kalaeloa and Kapalua, Maui. 'We've asked the (state Department of Transportation) to put up the normal signs that occur all over the 50 states, and they've yet to do that,' Hansen said. 'We've asked and asked and asked. We've even put up little signs ourselves — like campaign signs— but the community takes them down because they're not approved.' Lost in Paradise: Mokulele Airlines wants to help Hawaiians get to Maui from far-off west Oahu, but they can't seem to find the airport . The transportation department is working with the city and county and other state agencies to post signs, said Ross Higashi, deputy director of airports. Hansen said if the state fails to follow through with the signs, Mokulele Airlines might have to pull out of service at the airport. 'We invest a lot of money in these flights — a considerable amount of money — and it's like we're playing with one hand tied behind our back,' he said. 'When people can't find the airport, how do you expect an airline to survive? We just hope the state does its part.' Hawaii Tourism Authority President and CEO Mike McCartney said flights out of Kalaeloa provide an alternative to Honolulu International Airport and help with development on the island's west side.","Mokulele Airlines wants to help Hawaiians get to Maui from far-off west Oahu, but they can't seem to find the airport .

But Superintendent Dave Hutchinson could not confirm whether it was in fact the murder weapon. 'It was damaged during the incident and has the victim's blood on it,' he told the Gold Coast Bulletin,'the victim died of blunt force trauma but I can't say it was all that was used.' Gold Coast Police are now on the hunt for a vehicle which they believe may have been the offender's getaway car.

A dark coloured 2008 or 2009 Ford Falcon sedan was seen on Foxwell Road and Hope Island Road at Coomera between 3am and 4am on the morning of the murder . 'The vehicle of interest coincides with information from witnesses who saw the vehicle leaving the crime scene and in the vicinity of the crime scene,' said Superintendent Hutchinson. 'We have information from witnesses that  the driver of the vehicle was female and that there was a male in the front passenger seat.' 'From the review of our CCTV footage we can track the movements of this vehicle to a certain extent and we can show the vehicle arriving in Foxwell road and moving around the Foxwell road area and we can track along Foxwell road in a westerly direction and the vehicle subsequently ended up on Hope Island road,' he said.

"After her brother died in a motorbike accident, Sharron Clarke decided to give him the 30th birthday gift he had always wanted – spending weeks making a 2ft novelty Rolex watch. But days after she laid it on brother Andrew's grave it was gone – snatched by an opportunistic thief. Miss Clarke, 33, from Manchester, launched a Facebook appeal and was contacted by staff at a local pub, who told her someone had tried to sell the watch. They gave her CCTV images of two suspects, which she has now passed on to police. Sharron Clarke, left, made the tribute for her brother Andrew, right, who died tragically in a motorcycle crash . Scaffolder Mr Clarke, a father of two, was killed in May 2012 when his motorbike hit a car. His sister said: 'I just hope these vile people can be tracked down – it's an absolutely disgraceful thing to do.' Mr Clarke died in a motorbike crash on May 18, 2012. Miss Clarke, from Openshaw, Greater Manchester, launched a Facebook appeal to track it down and was contacted by a member of staff at a pub who told her someone had tried to sell it. She contacted the Waggon and Horses pub and was given CCTV images of the male and female suspects before passing them on to police. She said: 'Andrew loved his cars and watches but could never afford to buy himself a Rolex. 'I spent two weeks with my mum making it - we put a lot of time and effort into doing it as we know Andrew would have appreciated the gesture. The suspected thieves, left, grabbed the giant novelty watch from Mr Clarke's grave, right . 'We only put the flowers on the grave on the Friday and they were stolen four days later. 'It made me feel physically sick when I found out they had been nicked and even worse that the thieves had been trying to sell it. 'It's absolutely disgraceful to think that anyone could do this - they really are the lowest of the low.' Mr Clarke, a scaffolder, tragically died when his Suzuki GSXR600 bike collided with a Toyota Yaris. Miss Clarke and their mother  Maureen, 60, regularly visit his grave in Gorton Cemetery but were left horrified when they discovered the tribute had gone missing. She now wants CCTV installed at the cemetery to prevent future thefts. The suspected thieves were caught on CCTV carrying the giant novelty watch away from the cemetery . She said: 'I put an appeal on a sale or swap page on Facebook and almost instantly a lady who worked at the pub replied to my message. 'She told me she felt suspicious when the suspects tried to sell her the tribute. 'I asked if I could check their CCTV footage and the landlord was brilliant - he did everything he could to help out. 'I gave the pictures to police who are now investigating. I just hope these vile people can be tracked down - it's an absolutely disgraceful thing to do. 'Hopefully some CCTV can be installed at the cemetery because this sort of thing should never happen. 'All we wanted to do was to pay respects to our loved ones in peace.' Greater Manchester Police said an investigation was underway.","Andrew Clarke died in a tragic motorcycle accident in May 2012 .

"Two of Pol Pot's senior leaders during the Khmer Rouge purges in Cambodia appeared in a United Nations backed court yesterday facing charges of mass murder, forced marriage and rape. Nuon Chea, 88, known as 'Brother Number Two', and ex-head of state Khieu Samphan, 83, have already been given life sentences after a separate trial at the same court in August for crimes against humanity. That ruling saw them become the first top figures to be jailed from a regime responsible for the deaths of up to two million Cambodians from 1975-1979. Scroll down for video . Former Khmer Rouge leaders Khieu Samphan, left and Nuon Chea, right, are on trial in Cambodia in a special UN backed court facing charges of mass murder and rape over their time in power between 1975 and 1979 . The Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot, right, was known as 'Brother Number One', his deputy Nuon Chea, also known as 'Brother Number Two', centre, and Khieu Samphan, left have already been found guilty of genocide . The second trial, which opened in July, got under way Friday with judge Nil Nonn reading out the charges of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Nuon Chea, wearing his trademark black sunglasses, and Khieu Samphan sat in court alongside their defence teams as around 300 survivors of the regime protested outside, demanding monetary compensation for their suffering. The complex case against the pair was split into a series of smaller trials in 2011 to get a faster verdict given the vast number of accusations and their advanced age. Both men have appealed their August convictions, which followed a two-year trial focused on the forced evacuation of around two million Cambodians from Phnom Penh into rural labour camps and murders at one execution site. The second trial, broader in scope than the first, is viewed as an opportunity for many other victims of the regime to seek redress. Prosecutor Chea Leang told the court in his opening statement: 'The accused will now face trial for the biggest crimes for which they have been indicted This court cannot be closed until justice is done for the victims of these crimes.' The testimony by the prosecution's first witness, originally scheduled for Monday, has been postponed until October 27. Khieu Samphan, pictured, was the Khmer Rouge's former head of state between 1975 and their fall in 1979 . It is estimated that Nuon Chea and his fellow leaders were responsible for the murder of two million people . Pol Pot, pictured, ruled Cambodia, which he named Democratic Kampuchea, between 1975 and 1979 . The Khmer Rouge, the communist ruling party in Cambodia between 1975 and 1979, was responsible for the deaths of almost two million people, through executions, torture and starvation. Its leader, Pol Pot, was determined for society to be transformed into classless agricultural communism – at any cost. City dwellers were marched into the countryside to become farmers in labour camps, with those refusing to move shot dead and their homes burned to the ground. Factories, schools, banks and even hospitals were shut down and the population denied medicine. Many died through starvation – after all, most people from cities had no idea how to fend for themselves in the countryside and farmers were often too terrified to help them adapt. Some died through exhaustion, because the regime severely overworked those tending the land. Many were tortured and executed for being ‘enemies of the regime’. Anyone with links to the former Cambodian government, filmmakers, writers and indeed anyone deemed to be intellectual deserved to be put to death in the eyes of Pot. Even simply owning a pair of glasses could prove fatal, because as far as the regime was concerned, it meant that books were being read instead of hard labour being carried out. Religion was outlawed, so Christians, Muslims and Buddhists were also executed in huge numbers. The mass killings of an estimated 100,000 to 500,000 ethnic Cham Muslims and 20,000 Vietnamese form the basis of the genocide charges against the pair. Before these charges were filed, the treatment of the minority Muslim group and Vietnamese community was rarely discussed. Seth Maly, a 64-year-old Cham labour camp survivor who lost 100 of her relatives, including her two daughters, parents and five siblings said: 'The ways in which the Khmer Rouge mistreated us is too heinous to describe in words. Their goal was to exterminate our race.' Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan also face charges of crimes against humanity and war crimes in the second trial - for the deaths of up to two million Cambodians through starvation, overwork or execution during the communist regime. Most of these deaths do not fall under the charge of genocide, which is defined by the United Nations as 'acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group'. Anne Heindel, an adviser to the Documentation Center of Cambodia which researches the country's bloody history.'Without a second trial, there would be an enormous gap in the legal record about crimes that defined the experience of - and still traumatise - regime survivors.' Led by 'Brother Number One' Pol Pot, who died in 1998, the Khmer Rouge dismantled Cambodian society in a bid to create an agrarian utopia. The hearings will also provide the first forum for justice for tens of thousands of husbands and wives forced to marry, often in mass ceremonies, as part of a Khmer Rouge plan to boost the population. The rape charges refer to rape within the forced marriages. A court spokesman has estimated the trial may go on until 2016, with hearings covering crimes committed at Khmer Rouge labour camps and prisons including the notorious Tuol Sleng, also known as S-21. In its historic debut trial, the court in 2010 sentenced former Tuol Sleng prison chief Kaing Guek Eav to 30 years in prison - later increased to life on appeal - for overseeing the deaths of 15,000 people. Since the fall of the Khmer Rouge in 1979, researchers have found mass graves containing thousands of victims of the regime's violence after they cleared towns and cities murdering suspected intellectuals . The regime routinely shot people wearing glasses in the head because they were deemed 'intellectuals' and were more interested in reading books rather than working hard in the fields . The Khmer Rouge regime fell in 1979 but its leadership remained in exile until after Pot's death in 1998 .","The Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia between 1975 and 1979 killing two million .

"Britain's most senior civil servant has been lavishly wined and dined by energy chiefs and bankers. Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood last year accepted hospitality from a series of bosses of major firms, calling into question his supposed neutrality. As well as expensive dinners, he enjoyed trips to the opera, music recitals and private gallery visits. Sir Jeremy Heywood, one of Britain's top civil servants, seen here inside Number Ten, has been lavishly wined and dined by energy chiefs and bankers . Many of those with whom he dined, including energy firm Centrica and bankers Goldman Sachs, are directly affected by government policy. The civil servant – dubbed Sir Cover-up after preventing the Iraq War inquiry from seeing messages between Tony Blair and George W Bush – also met people from a company set up by bankers from Morgan Stanley, where he used to work. The meetings, reported in Private Eye, will cause concern that such businesses have too much influence among unelected mandarins in the corridors of power. As the head of the civil service, Sir Jeremy is supposed to be scrupulously neutral. Critics will say it should be politicians – not Whitehall mandarins – meeting such figures. Sir Jeremy was dubbed Sir Cover-up after preventing the Iraq War inquiry from seeing messages between Tony Blair and George W Bush . Labour has promised a freeze on energy bills and has accused the Government of not being hard enough on the Big Six firms. Revelations that Sir Jeremy met with Centrica will only add to such accusations. In addition, the Government opposed European calls for a crackdown on bankers’ bonuses and the way the City operates – at a time when Sir Jeremy was meeting investment bankers and City lobbyists. Last night Labour’s John Mann, of the Treasury select committee, said: ‘He would be better off meeting British lorry drivers in Calais, patients waiting for operations and victims of crime. It’s all too cosy at the top of government.’ Labour’s John Mann, of the Treasury select committee, said Sir Jeremy  'would be better off meeting British lorry drivers in Calais, patients waiting for operations and victims of crime' Sir Jeremy is seen as David Cameron’s right-hand man, making sure policies get through, and was Tony Blair’s Principal Private Secretary from 1999 to 2003. In May, it emerged Sir Jeremy had vetoed the release to the Chilcot Inquiry into the Iraq War of letters and records of phone calls between Tony Blair and George W Bush.

Dinner with the CBI . Contents of 150 messages – thought to reveal why Mr Blair dragged Britain into war – will be censored from the £10million inquiry, thanks to a backroom deal by Sir Jeremy. The latest official registers show that he is a prolific junketeer, happy to dine with powerful firms with a direct stake in government policy. They reveal he enjoyed a dinner and music recital from Centrica, which owns British Gas – one of the firms lobbying against government efforts to clamp down on fuel bills. From Goldman Sachs Sir Jeremy accepted dinner, despite the fact HMRC was accused of letting the bank off over millions of pounds in tax thanks to a ‘sweetheart deal’. He and wife Suzanne were treated to ‘refreshments, opera and dinner’ by Robertson Robey, an investment banking firm set up by bankers from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Sir Jeremy also went to the annual dinner of management consultancy McKinsey – where Mrs Heywood is a director. A Cabinet Office spokesman said Sir Jeremy ‘acts at all times in compliance with the Civil Service Code’, adding: [He] meets a wide range of external contacts in the course of doing his job … Occasionally he attends breakfasts, lunches or dinners which are typically working occasions or charitable events.’","Sir Jeremy enjoyed expensive dinners, trips to the opera and music recitals .

"If you live in Australia and love  dumplings then your life just got three times better. Tim Ho Wan, the world's cheapest Michelin-starred restaurant from Hong Kong is set to open three eateries in Sydney next year. The bite-sized  dumplings have attracted large crowds obsessed with dim sum, prompting founder and chef Mak Kwai Pui from Four Seasons Hong Kong to set up restaurants throughout Singapore. Tim Ho Wan, the world's cheapest Michelin-starred restaurant from Hong Kong is set to open three eateries in Sydney next year . The bite-sized dumplings have attracted large crowds obsessed with dim sum, prompting founder and chef Mak Kwai Pui from Four Seasons Hong Kong to set up restaurants throughout Singapore . Now, Australians will get to experience the  sort-out dumplings at Tim Ho Wan, as the restaurant prepares to open their first restaurant outside Asia in Sydney's northshore, with more Australian outlets to come. 'The first will open in Chatswood, above the railway station, in late February. Then at Westfield in Burwood in June, with the George Street restaurant, located opposite Event Cinema, in October,' Vince Howe, who is heading up Tim Ho Wan's Australian operations, told Good Food. Like in Asia, Mr Howe is expecting long queues at his international box-sized restaurants. If you live in Australia and love dumplings then your life just got three times better . Australia's appreciation for Asian food helped in the decision when trying to chose between Tim Ho Wan's global fan base for the next location for their new restaurant . 'Most of our restaurants you can queue for up to an hour and a half, in Sydney we'll be offering a reserve option,' he said. Australia's appreciation for Asian food helped in the decision when trying to chose between Tim Ho Wan's global fan base for the next location for their new restaurant. Mr Howe said Australian taste-buds are well tuned to Asian food, so it was only natural to bring the Michelin-starred restaurant to Australia, over Europe or the US. 'Plus, the Aussies were the first foreigners to flood to Tim Ho Wan,' he said. Unlike yum cha, Tim Ho Wan promises to provide the freshest dim sum in their restaurants. 'Everything we make is fresh and made to order. Nothing is made overnight or frozen. It's also good to have a menu, so you know what you're paying for. With [the cart system] there is that surprise at the end of the meal when you find out what it cost.'

"New life: Tracey Connelly, who  allowed her son Baby P to be tortured to death, has left her bail hostel to start a new life at a seaside resort at the expense of taxpayers . The cruel mother who allowed her son Baby P to be tortured to death has left the bail hostel where she has been living to start a new life at a seaside resort at the expense of taxpayers. Tracey Connelly had been staying at a half-way house following her release from a Durham prison but probation officers have now allowed her to move into a home of her own. Connelly, 32, who was jailed in 2009 over the brutal murder of her son Peter, has moved from the hostel in northern England to a flat, and hopes to find employment at the coastal tourist town. While she searches for a new job, Connelly - who has been given a new name - will receive £72.40 a week in Jobseeker's Allowance as well as other state handouts including housing benefit of around £400 every month and a grant of roughly £750 so she can decorate her new home. A source at the probation service said that Connelly had wanted to leave the women only half-way house, and it had been agreed that she was ready to start a new life. She has been released far from Haringey in north London where 17-month-old Peter was killed, and probation officers will continue to monitor her. 'She is hundreds of miles away from where she was, which should increase . her chances of not being recognised,' the source told the Daily Mirror. Connelly was jailed indefinitely in 2009 after she admitted doing . nothing while her little boy was tortured to death by her boyfriend . Steven Barker and his paedophile brother Jason Owen. Peter was found dead in his blood-spattered cot at . his mother’s flat in Tottenham, north London, after suffering 50 . separate injuries, including a broken back. The case provoked a national scandal after it emerged that social workers, police and doctors missed a series of warning signs that could have saved the child’s life. Victim: Peter Connelly was found dead in his blood-spattered cot at his mother's flat in Tottenham, north London, after suffering 50 separate injuries, including a broken back . As she was granted parole last autumn, Connelly had begged for an anonymity order and round-the-clock police protection, but ministers refused. These orders are rare and only four are currently in force. These apply to child killer Mary Bell, James Bulger’s murderers Robert Thompson and Jon Venables and to Maxine Carr, who provided a false alibi for Soham murderer Ian Huntley. Connelly, who ballooned to more than 22st while in prison before putting on another two stone following her release, has . been encouraged that as well as changing her name, she should try to . alter her appearance and was warned not to reveal details of her past.

It has been reported that she snacks on eight . chocolate bars a day and dreams of working in a bakery. It was alleged that she may have been helped out of her Durham jail in convoy of vehicles carrying 'dummy' obese women. Sources said that extra vehicles containing women of a similar weight with their faces covered could also be used to throw anyone keen to follow her off the scent. The same ploy was used when Maxine Carr left prison. In 2004, when Carr left Foston Hall prison in Derbyshire, she was stowed in the footwell of a car at the same time as several similar vehicles also left.

"Two goals in the last five minutes from Britt Assombalonga and Michail Antonio helped Nottingham Forest end their torrid run of form in the Championship with a 2-1 win over Norwich. Forest had looked destined for a 10th league game without a win, with the Canaries looking on course for the three points thanks to Jonny Howson’s first-half strike. But Assombalonga conjured up an 85th-minute equaliser - his 10th goal of the season - and then the roof was lifted off the City Ground as Antonio also bagged his 10th of the campaign to secure a much-needed win for the Reds, while extending Norwich’s own frustrating run to one win in eight games. Michail Antonio is mobbed after scoring the decisive goal in Nottingham Forest's win over Norwich . Britt Assombalonga draws the hosts level with five minutes remaining at the City Ground . Nottm Forest: Darlow, Hunt (Lichaj 66), Mancienne, Lascelles, Harding (Lansbury 66), Antonio, Tesche, Osborn, Ince (Paterson 46), Fryatt, Assombalonga. Subs Not Used: Collins, Blackstock, Christopher Burke, De Vries. Booked: Tesche, Antonio. Goals: Assombalonga 85, Antonio 90. Norwich: Ruddy, Martin, Cuellar, Turner, Olsson, Tettey, O'Neil, Johnson, Howson, Grabban, Jerome (Lafferty 75). Subs Not Used: Whittaker, Hooper, Hooiveld, Murphy, Redmond, Rudd. Booked: Martin, Tettey, Lafferty. Goals: Howson 16. Att: 24,783 . Ref: Andrew Madley (West Yorkshire). It was Forest who started brightly, with Tom Ince agonisingly close to giving them the lead following good work from Antonio down the left, with the winger’s shot narrowly clearing the crossbar. However, the home side could not make their short spell of dominance count and, when Norwich were utterly ruthless with their first opportunity of the match as Howson put them in front, the home side’s confidence drained away visibly. Lewis Grabban could and should have doubled the Canaries’ advantage when presented with a free header at the near post following Russell Martin’s cross, but directed his effort wide of the target, albeit only by a matter of inches. Forest were looking nervous on the ball, with the mood having changed dramatically in the City Ground. They did carve out a handful of opportunities to level before the break, with Antonio failing to properly connect with a Jack Hunt cross at the far post and Assombalonga sending a dipping 30-yard free-kick just over the bar. Jonny Howson had fired the visiting side into the lead with only 16 minutes of the Championship clash gone . But they were half-chances at best and, when the half-time whistle arrived, it was greeted with a chorus of boos from the frustrated Forest fans. Forest boss Stuart Pearce responded by bringing on Jamie Paterson in place of Ince during the interval. However, it was Cameron Jerome who had the chance to add to Norwich’s tally, firing over the bar amid a mad scramble by the penalty spot. Grabban then forced a smart save from Karl Darlow at his near post with a driven strike that the keeper did well to push away, with the visitors forcing a spell of pressure. Forest finally began to find some attacking momentum but Assombalonga’s shot, following good build up around the penalty area, was easily charged down and a spectacular effort from Antonio flew a few feet over the bar. Assombalonga had a gilt-edged chance to level when substitute Paterson picked him out at the near post, but his header was off target. Another replacement, Henri Lansbury, then picked out Antonio in an identical position, but he failed to connect with the ball completely. But Forest did finally make the breakthrough with five minutes to play as Fryatt picked out Assombalonga eight yards out, and the striker made no mistake as he prodded the ball home. And it got even better for Forest, as Assombalonga then turned provider deep into stoppage time, collecting a fine ball from Paterson before sending Antonio loping into the box, where the winger dispatched the winning goal into the bottom corner of the net.","Britt Assombalonga and Michail Antonio on target in closing minutes .

She died at the Providence Medical Center, which described Ms Soriano's death at 9.30pm PST as a 'senseless tragedy' and invited the community to join a minute's silence at 10.39am on Monday - exactly 72 hours after the attack. Memorial: Carved pumpkins with the names of those involved in a deadly school shooting nearly a week earlier line a memorial for victims . Coming together: People walk arm-in-arm past a memorial for victims following seven days after the shooting . One of the two remaining survivors - Andrew Fryberg - are still in critical condition being treated for severe head wounds. The third, Nate Hatch, is recovering but cannot talk and still has a bullet in his chest. Last night, Nate gave hope to friends and relatives reeling in shock by posting a Facebook update from his bed at Harborview Medical Center saying: 'Greatful [sic] to be alive'. He was shot in the jaw by his cousin and best friend, Jaylen. His grandfather, Donald Hatch, revealed Nate had started communicating with his family by writing notes. Donald Hatch told King5 reporter Alex Rozier that Nate knows it was his close cousin Jaylen who opened fire on the group of friends. He said one of the notes Nate had written to his family reads: 'Grandpa, I still have a bullet in my chest'. Spoken out: Nate Hatch posted this Facebook message from Harborview Medical Center where he is being treated for a gunshot to the jaw fired  by his cousin Jaylen Fryberg in Friday's school shooting .

It has been claimed Jaylen had a crush on Zoe Galasso and became heartbroken when she dated his cousin, Andrew. Ms Galasso was sitting around a table with her friends at Marysville-Pilchuck High School on Friday when Jaylen Fryberg opened fire. She was pictured attending the homecoming dance at the Washington school with Andrew Fryberg after she and Jaylen Fryberg fell out, just days before the deadly attack. Jaylen had previously treated Andrew like a brother, and was devastated to learn the girl who rejected him and chosen his cousin instead. In an ominous indication of the anger that spurred his deadly tirade, Jaylen tweeted last month: 'Dude. She tells me everything. And now I f***ing HATE you! Your no longer my 'Brother'!' The teenage girls are believed to be friends of Jaylen Fryberg, with witnesses suggesting he targeted them in a room full of hundreds of students. Lukas Thorington, 14, a freshman at Marysville's other public high school who grew up with Ms Galasso and Ms Chuckulnaksit said they were outgoing, popular kids. He told the Seattle Times: 'Zoe was very outgoing. She was into sports. She was nice and awesome. She was fun to hang out with.' Corey Williams, 37, is friends with Zoe's mother and wanted to help, so he set up a fundraising page to raise money for the Galasso family. Donations have already exceeded $14,000.

"Could this be the worst corner routine ever devised by a professional football team? FK Pribram, who play in the top tier of Czech football, tried something a little different in their 1-1 draw with Teplice at the weekend. Lining up for a corner, five of their outfield players congregated on the edge of the opposition box, before spinning around in a circle - one way, then the other - as they waited for the corner to come in. As the Teplice players watched on in awe, Pribram struck. Suddenly, they turned and sprinted into the box in tandem, ready to attack the incoming corner.

"The Reserve Bank is working with other regulators to crack down on risky lending to housing investors amid concerns they are intensifying soaring property prices in Sydney and Melbourne. Australia's central bank is worried that the fast-growing rate at which banks are lending to investors is out of proportion with rental demand. This could have wider-ranging effects on the economy, the RBA warned in its twice-yearly Financial Stability Review. Scroll down for video . House for sale on Chastleton Avenue in Toorak, Melbourne. The blue-chip suburb is a favourite among investors . The Reserve Bank is working with other regulators to crack down on risky lending to housing investors amid concerns they are intensifying soaring property prices . Loans to property investors are growing at nearly 10 percent, the fastest pace since 2007, and almost double the rate for owner-occupiers. And Australian Bureau of Statistics housing finance figures show investors account for more than 40 per cent of new home loans. 'As a result, the composition of housing and mortgage markets is becoming unbalanced, with new lending to investors being out of proportion to rental housing's share of the housing stock,' the RBA wrote. The RBA questioned whether banks were practicing enough caution in their lending practices considering the current climate of 'low interest rates, strong housing price growth and higher household indebtedness than in past decades.' House prices rose 16 per cent year-on-year in Sydney in August, and 12 per cent in Melbourne, RP Data figures showed. To address the risks the RBA said it had been working with the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority to increase the intensity of its supervision of banks' lending practices. Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia Glenn Stevens . The Reserve Bank released a draft of new guidelines and said it was considering taking 'further steps' to reinforce responsible lending to investors with APRA and other members of the Council of Financial Regulators. AMP chief economist Shane Oliver said the decision to regulate lending to investors, known as 'macroprudential policy', hadn't been seen in Australia for about 30 years. Normally at this point in property cycle the RBA would raise interest rates, but it is reluctant to do so because the economy is 'a bit messy'. But if the RBA failed to take any action the property market would continue to gather momentum, Mr Oliver said. 'We would end up with full-blown bubble which could burst, which would have devastating effects on the economy,' he said. 'The worry would be that the higher prices grow, the greater the chance you're risking [house price] falls of 20-30 percent, not just 5-10 percent.' Mr Oliver said high auction clearance rates – particularly in Sydney and Melbourne – were welcomed a year ago but are now causing concern for the RBA. The central bank is worried that the fast-growing rate at which banks are lending to investors is out of proportion with rental demand . House for sale on Stanley Avenue in Sydney's Mosman, another favourite among investors . 'They wanted housing to pick up to fill a gap left by mining,' he said. 'The whole point of cutting interest rates was to drive demand to homes, push up house prices and send a signal to home builders to build more homes, because once you get housing going it boosts retail spending as well.' Mr Oliver said that was achieved a year ago but auction clearance rates were still at record levels. 'Sydney's at record level, Melbourne's pushing up at record levels and that makes them think it's getting too hot and it's become a bit speculative,' he said. If the RBA failed to take action – either by lifting interest rates or using macroprudential measures – the property market could suffer a 'sharp collapse', Mr Oliver said. Loans to property investors are growing at nearly 10 percent, the fastest pace since 2007, and almost double the rate for owner-occupiers . 'It's what was happening in the US and Ireland prior to the GFC, and those countries went on to see falls of 30-40 percent,' he said. 'Homeowners see massive losses in wealth, they spend less, people have trouble servicing their mortgages.' Mr Oliver said macroprudential policy would benefit mortgage holders. 'If the Reserve does go down this path then it takes off some of the pressure to raise interest rates,' he said. 'It could mean a good outcome for those who have a mortgage, because we'll have lower interest rates for even longer.'

"A police public appeal for the whereabouts of a New Zealand man took an unexpected turn on social media when it was met by taunts from the wanted man himself. Christchurch police issued an image of Samuel Evan Lake on their Facebook page at about 10pm on Saturday night in an effort to help find and arrest him. However, a cat-and-mouse line of dialogue between police and Mr Lake himself, who began to tease the officers, soon formed below the post. Samuel Evan Lake mocked Christchurch police over Facebook after they released a mug shot and a a public appeal for information on his whereabouts to help in his arrest . 'Samuel Evan Lake has a warrant for his arrest. LAKE is 23 years of age, 171cm tall and of thin build. ""Fate"" is tattooed on his neck,' the police social media post read. Instantly, Mr Lake himself responded to the post which included an image of his face. 'I need to get a new mug shot,' the 23-year-old wrote in a comment that has since been liked over 3,000 times and had over 186 replies.

"He earns millions a year from his consultancy roles and charges fees of £250,000 for public speaking – but Tony Blair insists he is not motivated by money. And he dismissed reports he has amassed £100million since leaving office as ‘greatly exaggerated’. In a rare comment on his personal finances, Mr Blair suggested he was worth less than £20million, despite the family owning property worth at least £30million. Tony Blair today denied being worth £100million, insisting the true value was around a fifth of that figure . The former Prime Minister used a speech to the to the Progress centre-left think-tank in London to mark 20 years since he was elected Labour leader . Responding to a question about his . lucrative earnings, Mr Blair, who was marking the 20th anniversary of . becoming Labour leader, joked that his wife kept demanding to know where . his reported money is. And he insisted that he is still motivated by the same ‘values’ as he was when he became Labour leader in 1997. ‘Today . my work is global,’ he told an audience of admirers from the Blairite . group Progress. ‘But what gets me up in the morning is the same.’ He . added: ‘I haven’t changed, despite people wanting to say that I have . changed. The same thing that motivated me when I stood here as Labour 20 . years ago motivates me today – it’s not about making money, it’s about . making a difference.’ Mr Blair joked that his wife Cherie had been asking where his reported £100million wealth was hidden . Speaking . about reports of his fortune, Mr Blair added: ‘In respect to my new . life, first of all, I have to say that reports of my wealth are greatly . exaggerated. Just for the record, I read I’m supposed to be worth . £100million – Cherie’s kind of asking where it is. I’m not worth that, . half of that, a third of that, a quarter of that, a fifth of that … I . could go on.’ He said he . spends two-thirds of his time on his unpaid role as a Middle East ‘peace . envoy’ and his charitable foundations, which focus on Africa and faith . issues. ‘I also employ today over 200 people,’ he added. He . was cheered by an audience that included many old friends and former . Cabinet colleagues including Peter Mandelson, Tessa Jowell and Lord . Adonis.

Mr Blair also raised a laugh when he was asked about comments . from Boris Johnson, who suggested he needed psychiatric treatment after . saying the West should bomb Syria and Iraq. Labour leader Ed Miliband was warned not to allow his party to be run by social media and pressure groups. Tony Blair said he had to show conviction himself, and not be buffeted by people who 'shout the loudest'. He warned against lurching to the left in response to calls from people who do represent the public mood. Mr Blair said: 'We should, of course, listen to the interests associated with us, and the assortment of pressure groups banging on our door but never conflate their noise, which with social media can seem deafening, with public opinion or let them decide policy. 'Those who shout the loudest don't necessarily deserve to be heard the most.' Mr . Blair responded: ‘It is a little disconcerting to be described as mad . by Boris Johnson – relatively speaking it is not a high bar.’ Mr . Blair rarely talks about his personal finances, but analysis suggests . he was being unduly modest about his own good fortune. His property . empire alone is worth at least £30million. His . five-storey central London home, and its accompanying mews house is . thought to be worth at least £8million, while his Grade I-listed manor . house in Buckinghamshire, which was once owned by Sir John Gielgud, is . thought to be worth a similar amount. He and Mrs Blair also own another seven properties. Since . leaving office in 2007, Mr Blair has set up a complex web of companies, . which make it impossible to calculate his exact earnings. However, the . two that cover his consultancy work have declared cash reserves of . £13.4million and shareholder funds worth £7million, according to the . most recent accounts. He has . also carved out a role as a global consultant to corporations and . foreign regimes, which is thought to bring him millions a year. And he . can command up to £250,000 for speeches to private sector audiences.

Asked if he had been arrested on suspicion of organising the drone stunt, Mr Tahiri told Reuters: 'Not to my knowledge. It's speculation.'

Uefa eventually awarded Italy a 3-0 win. Last night, the Albanian anthem was loudly jeered by Serbian fans and derogatory chanting was heard throughout the first half. Serbian supporters also threw flares at the pitch. The drone, clearly visible in the lights of the stadium, made a series of passes above the pitch.

The word 'autochthonous' refers to Serbia's alleged attempts to control Kosovo despite not being indigenous to the region. Seven of Albania's squad were born in the Kosovo region. Fearing trouble, hundreds of riot police were deployed inside and outside the Partizan stadium in Belgrade. Dozens of Albanian fans, mostly from Kosovo and Montenegro, apparently managed to get inside despite warnings by Serbian security officials that they would be arrested if they carry Albanian symbols. On his Twitter page, Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama congratulated Albanian players for their courage before the match was abandoned and added that he was ‘sorry for the neighbours who left a bad worldwide image with the ugly show’. Thousands of Albanian fans who followed the match on a big screen in Tirana headed for the airport in the Albanian capital to welcome the players arriving from Belgrade.

"Dozens of fish and reptiles have been killed by a toxic spill that will have Louisiana cleanup crews busy for months to come. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency officials confirmed that it was the result of an oil leak in the Caddo Parish from Mid-Valley Pipeline. 'I would call it a significant size spill,' said EPA on-scene coordinator Bill Rhotenberry. Dozens of fish and reptiles have been killed by a toxic spill that will have Louisiana cleanup crews busy for months to come . Roughly 4,000 barrels of oil spilled into the Tete Bayou before operators noticed a drop in pressure. Owner Sunoco Logistics shut down the line shortly after 8 a.m. Monday. 'That was a priority,' Shields told The Shreveport Times. The pipeline is approximately 1,000 miles long from Longview, Texas to Ohio and Michigan. The lake will be monitored throughout the cleaning process. About 250 workers are now on scene working on the recovery, wearing protective gear including respirators. Air monitors have also been placed throughout the area to make sure contaminants do not reach toxic levels. Workers clean up the 4,000 barrels of crude oil Saturday, Oct. 18, 2014, that spilled in Tete Bayou northwest of Shreveport, La . Some 1,900 barrels of oil have already been sucked up from the environment after crews worked furiously to clean up the spill . While evacuations were not necessary, three families left their homes voluntarily and will have expenses paid by Sunoco. 'The only risk of VOCs is in the immediate area of oil,' Rhotenberry said. 'Out of the spill's pathway that's not much of an issue.' As estimated 1,900 barrels of the oil have been recovered so far. Maintenance in the coming months will require regular placement of oil-absorbing material. Officials will also monitor surrounding wildlife for signs of contamination. An investigation into the leak will be done by the U.S. Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. Though initial recovery reports are promising, officials are asking hunters to keep clear of the area. 'It's a safety concern, also because of the equipment,' Louisiana State Police Troop G spokesman Matt Harris said.","US Environmental Protection Agency officials confirmed that it was the result of an oil leak in the Caddo Parish from Mid-Valley Pipeline .

"George W. Bush has said that he hopes world leaders take the images he has painted of them 'in the spirit of friendship' ahead of their unveiling. The 24 images, including Vladimir Putin, Tony Blair and the Dalai Lama, will feature in an exhibition at his presidential library in Dallas and will be revealed for the first time on the Today show on Friday. In an interview that partly aired on the Today show on Thursday, Bush, who picked up the paintbrush when he left the White House and has since mastered images of the family pets and landscapes, spoke with his daughter Jenna Bush Hager about the leaders' reactions to his work. Scroll down for video . Anticipation: George W. Bush, pictured on the Today show on Thursday, is about to unveil 24 portraits he has painted of world leaders, which will be on exhibition at his presidential library . Proud: His daughter, Jenna Bush Hager, left, will be unveiling the work on the Today show on Friday . 'I hope . they take it in the spirit in which these were painted in,' he said. 'That was the . spirit of friendship and that I admire them as leaders and was willing . to give it a shot in terms of getting people to see how I felt about . them.' It won't be the first time the public has seen his paintings. Last year, a hacker leaked his images of animals, landscapes and self portraits, such as him in the bath. 'I was annoyed,' Bush said. 'It's an invasion of one's privacy... nor do I want my paintings to get out. 'The truth . of the matter is my paintings are not ready to be released. I mean, I'm . still learning, and I don't know if they ever will be or not.' Speaking to his daughter, who is a . correspondent on the Today show, added that the most important thing he . has learned so far is, 'don't paint your wife,' he said. Work: Some of his paintings, including images of dogs and self-portraits, have previously been seen . Revealed: Some of the images, including ones of him in the shower and a bathtub, were leaked last year . Invasive: Bush said that he felt that much of his artwork wasn't ready for public viewing . Of his portrait of her, wife Laura laughed: 'Yeah, it still needs some work.' Former first lady Laura Bush will join her husband for a portion of the interview, which will air in full on Friday, inside the art studio in their Dallas home. The two-term president has led a significantly quieter life since leaving office - spending much of his time painting and going on mountain bike rides with groups of veterans like Wounded Warrior. In an interview with the Dallas Morning News last year, Bush added that painting gives him an opportunity to 'create.' He also reflected on what others think of his work. 'People are surprised,' Bush said. 'Of course, some people are surprised I can even read.' In March last year, an artist who taught Bush how to paint both animals and landscapes in a recent month-long course spoke out his skills as a late-in-life painter. On show: Among his new portraits, Bush has painted an image of Russian President Vladimir Putin, right . He had spent four weeks in private lessons alongside his sister-in-law in a home in Boca Grande, Florida where they improved their technique and expanded their artistic horizons. 'He has such a passion for painting, it's amazing,' said instructor Bonnie Flood. 'The Art of Leadership: A President's Personal Diplomacy' will be held at the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum on the campus of Southern Methodist University in Dallas. The museum explained the exhibition 'will explore the relationships that President George W. Bush forged with world leaders to shape international policy and advance American interests abroad.' 'The exhibit will feature more than two dozen never-before-exhibited portraits painted by President Bush,' it said. 'Portraits will be accompanied by artifacts, photographs, and personal reflections to help illustrate the stories of relationships formed on the world stage.'","Bush has painted 24 images of world leaders that will be on show at his presidential library in Texas .

"Pictures taken at the dawn of photography depicting pretty seaside towns in the West Country show just how little has changed on the coast since the 19th century. Captured by James Valentine, Francis Bedford and Francis Frith, the stunning landscapes have scarcely changed since when they were taken between 1860 and 1880. Bound in travel books designed to inspire readers who couldn't visit the area, they are being sold at auction 130 years after being taken. Scroll down for video . One of the earliest known photographs of St Ives in Cornwall taken from the top of Tregenna shows how little has changed in the area since the late 19th century . Shop fronts on The Wharf in St Ives have changed over the years while cobble stones have been replaced by tarmac. The curving beach-front street is still instantly recognisable from the photograph taken in the 1800s which was among the first collection of black-and-white images of the area . The three men took photos of Dartmouth, Torquay, North Devon, and pretty St Ives in Cornwall, which has noticeably fewer houses in its 1870s guise but still looks strikingly similar today. Another photo of St Michael's Mount, near Penzance, also shows how time has stood still on the iconic tidal island, with the steep summit and country house sitting atop it looking exactly as it does now. Pictures of Lynmouth in North Devon however tell a different story as they were taken before the devastating flood of 1952 which killed 34 people. The river has since been re-routed and hundreds of houses built. The four albums are to be sold on October 9 at Dominic Winter Auctions in Cirencester, Gloucestershire, where they are expected to fetch around £500. Dartmouth Harbour has barely changed in more than 100 years with the spires of St Saviour's Church poking out from behind the waterside Royal Castle Hotel . Rhenish Tower in Lynmouth, Devon, remains at the focal point of both images of the esplanade taken from sea. While more houses have popped up in the woodland behind it the tower, the view of the coastal town is very much the same . A different view of the seafront town Lynmouth taken from the Torrs shows a similar landscape. Much of the area was devastated by the 1952 flood which claimed the lives of more than 30 people . An early photograph of Lynmouth shows the River Lyn flowing between houses and buildings in the 1900s. Parts of the river had to be rerouted following the flood in 1952, with roads and houses cropping up in its place (pictured top) St Michael's Mount in Penzance has scarcely changed since 1900 with the exception of a causeway which is only accessible when there is a low tide. The rocky island is still home to a small community, with a 14th century Priory Church sitting proudly at its peak . A family of women are captured at Hicks Court in St Ives in the 1880s while they work and play (left). The distinctive concrete arch seen in the photograph is still present today (right) The town's harbour is depicted in the above photographs taken in 2014 and in the 1880s, showing how many homes have been erected since. The bell tower at St Ives Parish Church can be seen in both . Clovelly in north Devon is very much the same today as it appeared in the late 19th century, with houses perched on a steep hill before the waterfront in the fishing village . Auctioneer Chris Albury said: 'Francis Frith and Francis Bedford were two of the great British pioneers of commercial British landscape photography. 'In the decades before the picture postcard, the coastlines, villages and local people of Devon and Cornwall presented these photographers with endless possibilities to practise their art and to make money. 'Their documentation of the changing Victorian scene formed an invaluable record and it is striking for us now to see what has changed and what has stayed the same. 'The sepia tones and the figures that populate some of these photos add a haunting melancholy feel that is completely captivating.' Francis Bedford, who compiled the book, was the first photographer to ever be invited on an official royal tour after visiting Bethlehem with the Prince of Wales in 1862 at the request of Queen Victoria. Francis Frith, a former grocer, was one of the founding members of the Liverpool Photographic Society in 1853. He travelled the Middle East and the UK, taking landscape pictures for the use of postcards. Francis Frith & Co still exists. James Valentine meanwhile was a Scottish photographer. Valentine's of Dundee printed photographs on card from the 1960s. The albums are being sold at auction this month after more than 100 years. Francis Bedford was among three men whose created the first postcard from Britain .","Landscape views of St Ives, Dartmouth and Lynmouth among collection of historic images .

"Animal rights group PETA has released a distressing video that it says shows animals that it claims have been driven 'insane' while living in captivity. With the release of behind-the-scenes footage of captive animals the organisation is urging the public to boycott circuses and zoos. 'Zoochosis' is defined as a psychological condition of animals kept in circuses and zoos. PETA has released an eye-opening video of several animals in captivity apparently suffering from 'zoochosis' Symptoms are said to include pacing, circling, swaying, and even self-injury, caused by deprivation, loneliness, stress, desperation and insanity. The video shows clips of several animals in fragile psychological states, including a bear repeatedly walking in circles in a zoo, elephants swaying while housed in what looks like a barn, and a monkey engaging in self-harm. 'Even the best artificial environments can't come close to matching the space, diversity, and freedom that animals have in their natural habitats,' a statement on PETA's website reads. 'This deprivation - combined with relentless boredom, loneliness, stress, and sometimes even abuse, causes many captive animals to lose their minds.' 'Zoochosis' is a psychological condition caused by deprivation experienced by animals kept in confinement . PETA adds: 'Zoochosis is so rampant that some zoos even resort to administering mind-altering drugs such as Prozac to address the public's complaints about abnormal behaviours.' And, in circuses, the organisation asserts that the treatment of animals may be even more concerning. It claims circuses are not subject to any sort of treatment guidelines while training the animals because 'no government agency monitors training sessions.' Symptoms of the condition include swaying, self-harm and walking in circles, like this bear . Moreover, circuses often adhere to extensive travel schedules and as such, the animals spend a great deal of time confined to trucks and trailers in between shows. PETA points to examples of animals who have injured themselves - and often, others - while attempting to escape from zoo pens or circus travel cages. According to PETA: 'The living conditions at zoos, circuses, and other animal exhibits are often dismal, with animals confined to tiny, filthy, barren enclosures that can't come anywhere close to matching the space, diversity, and freedom that animals enjoy in their natural habitat.' 'Even the best artificial environments can't come close to their natural habitats,' PETA's website reads . Here, a bear attempts to escape from his enclosure by biting and chewing on the wire fence . Countries such as Austria, Bolivia, Finland, Singapore and Sweden have recently implemented bans on wild-animal acts in circuses. And in the UK, 94 per cent of respondents to a 2011 government consultation made clear that they wanted to see wild animal circuses banned entirely. As of now, 27 countries have bans on animal circuses and the UK could soon follow. 'Animals aren't actors,' says PETA's website, 'and yet thousands are forced to perform in zoos and circuses around the world every day.'","Animal rights organisation implores public to avoid circuses and zoos .

'This deprivation causes animals to lose their minds,' says PETA .

"Simon Stevens, head of the NHS, said the system of organising GPs surgeries outside of hospitals is 'past its used-by date' Hospitals will be urged to open up in-house GP surgeries to make it easier for patients to get appointments. Simon Stevens, the head of the NHS, says the move could ease the strain for practices where there are too few doctors and rising numbers of patients. The surgeries would be different from the walk-in centres and urgent care units that already exist in some hospitals alongside A&E units. They would operate as a normal surgery with their own list of patients. Addressing the Royal College of General Practitioners’ annual conference in Liverpool today, Mr Stevens will say that the traditional system of surgeries in villages and towns being totally separate from hospitals is ‘past its used-by date’. The proposals would open up more practices, making it easier for patients to register with a GP and get an appointment. But importantly, they would also enable family doctors to speak more easily with specialist consultants and confer about the best care for their patients. Mr Stevens is expected to say: ‘Alongside more doctors and more funding, we also need new and better ways of caring for patients, especially older patients at home. ‘GPs themselves say that in many parts of the country the corner shop model of primary care is past its used-by date. ‘We need to tear up the design flaw in the 1948 NHS model where family doctors were organised entirely separately from hospital specialists and where patients with chronic health conditions are increasingly passed from pillar to post between different bits of health and social services.’ Only yesterday the RCGP warned that 550 surgeries could close over the next year because so many family doctors are over 60 and nearing retirement. But there are few younger doctors coming up to replace them as the profession is regarded as unpopular. Scroll down for video . The Royal College of General Practitioners warned yesterday that 550 surgeries could close as so many doctors are in their 60s are about to retire . Earlier this week the Prime Minister promised that every patient would be able to see their GP seven days a week by 2020. David Cameron said from next year practices would be able to apply for extra funding to enable them to stay open on Saturdays and Sundays. But GPs say the plans won’t work as they are overstretched coping with a declining workforce and rising population. Dr Maureen Baker, chairman of the RCGP, said extra investment was needed just to keep the system afloat. Speaking yesterday to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme she added: ‘We do have a workforce crisis in general practice. ‘We’ve been losing GPs, we are losing GPs and we’re not recruiting enough doctors into the profession.’ Meanwhile Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has launched a review to determine how many extra GPs are needed and which areas in the country are particularly lacking in doctors. It will be overseen by Health Education England, the body responsible for education and training of the NHS workforce, and is likely to look at ways of encouraging more younger doctors to become GPs. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has launched a review to determine how many extra GPs are needed and which areas in the country are particularly lacking . But GPs have accused Mr Hunt of ‘constantly denigrating’ the profession and turning patients against them. Dr Stephanie de Giorgio, 38, a GP from Deal in Kent, told the RCGP conference: ‘We are exhausted, drowning, and quite frankly furious with you, what are you going to do about it?’ She said patients were increasingly contacting GPs about trivial complaints. ‘They want a note from the doctor to join their gym, to travel on Eurostar or get a referral to a homeopath,’ she said. ‘I’ve even known of cases where GPs have been called for a visit to put the bins out.’","Simon Stevens says system of surgeries in towns is 'past its used-by date'

"Early pioneer: Gillian McKeith was one of the first people to suggest a complete overhaul of the contents of your fridge as a good way to lose weight . I’m 50 and have spent my life overweight. I’ve done the Atkins and Dukan diets and Lighter Life, which left me bigger. I’m now on the 5:2 Diet but have lost only 5lb in two months. Am I cursed? You should be proud of yourself for persevering, but it sounds like you’ve fallen into the yo-yo dieting trap. The Atkins, the Dukan and Lighter Life are some of the most extreme diet plans on the market, and while this often works in the short term, restricting your calorie intake or cutting out whole food groups leads to fat gain when not on the diet. On the 5:2 you can eat what you want for five days a week, then restrict your calorie intake to a quarter of what’s recommended (600 for men, 500 for women) on the others. But this is a little misleading. If what you like eating on the normal days is processed food and sugary cakes and biscuits, you aren’t going to see the results you want. Is it also possible you have been treating yourself on these days, due to your disappointment at failing to get to the weight you want? Eating emotionally is another pitfall, as you’re more likely to reach for high-fat, high-sugar foods to make you feel better. I suggest a total overhaul of the contents of your fridge and kitchen cupboards. Gillian McKeith was one of the early pioneers of what’s considered a really healthy diet now, and one that will help you shed the pounds effortlessly. This will mean cutting out all processed foods – that’s anything that comes in a packet or has ingredients that sound like they were made in a laboratory. Dairy products, especially cheese, are also restricted. Instead, stock up on fresh fruit and vegetables, whole grains, organic eggs and other forms of animal protein, and nuts and seeds to snack on. I guarantee that combining these foods with the 5:2 eating plan, as well as adding some regular exercise (even fast walking) will help you see the results you want. The Alcohol Education Trust, whose supporters include Carol Vorderman, above, have launched a ‘Dryvember’ sobriety challenge . Go sober...every month . Last week I had my first glass of wine in a month - just as ‘Go Sober For October’ was being launched. I had been on ‘Sober September’, despite my belief that moderation is better than an all-or-nothing approach. However, my mood definitely improved without a tipple and I felt more focused. Now the Alcohol Education Trust – supporters include Carol Vorderman - have launched another challenge called ‘Dryvember’. Perhaps my new approach will be a month-on, month-off. Tara Stiles rules in the kitchen . I love the idea behind a new book by New York yogi and It Girl Tara Stiles. Called Make Your Own Rules Diet, it is divided into three sections – mat, cushion and kitchen – and designed to help you tap into the foods your body really needs with the help of regular yoga and meditation. The idea is that by taking the time to get in touch with your body, you won’t need to go on a ‘diet’ because you’ll be able to distinguish between real hunger and cravings, and nip emotional overeating in the bud. Tara’s also a vegan, so the recipes in the book are all plant-based – but the message is about finding a healthy approach to eating that’s 100 per cent right for you.

"Jailed: Paedophile Paul Emsley, 47, was sentenced to 18 months in prison at Burnley Crown Court . A convicted paedphile who was once filmed having sex with a 12-year-old boy has been jailed for a third time after police found a sickening child-abuse themed board game under his bed. Paul Emsley, 47, was caught when police visiting his home discovered a stash of child porn images along with the game - which involved participants pretending to be children and performing sex acts on each other. Officers also found drug paraphernalia in every room and a camera and video-enabled mobile phone, which Emsley was barred from possessing under the terms of a lifetime sexual offences prevention order (SOPO). Emsley, formerly of Padiham, Lancashire, was jailed for 45 months  in 1999 after having sex with a young boy before threatening to kill him if he told anyone what happened. He was jailed again for two-and-a-half years in 2012 for breaching the SOPO, after he was caught downloading hundreds of child porn images at his home. And in 2013 he was fined by magistrates for possession of a video or camera-enabled mobile phone, Burnley Crown Court heard. In the most recent incident, police visited the 47-year-old's home on May 10 on a matter unrelated to his SOPO. There they found a phone capable of taking videos and Emsley's sick collection of child pornography. The court heard that the stash included 24 images on a CD and seven images on a VHS tape - with the banned images interspersed with legal homosexual pornography. Six or seven of the illegal images were classed as category A - the most serious kind - and depicted penetrative sex involving children. Judge Jonathan Gibson sentenced Emsley to 18 months in prison for one count of making indecent images, and two months for the second count, to run consecutively. Restrictions: Emsley was banned from having any unsupervised contact with a boy under 16 years old or living in a house with a boy aged under 16-years-old, at Burnley Crown Court (above) He also revoked the earlier SOPO, and issued Emsley with a fresh order. He is now prevented from having any unsupervised contact with a boy under 16 years old or living in a house with a boy aged under 16. Emsley is also prohibited from possessing a computer or device capable of searching the internet, unless the device is surrendered to the police or probation service for inspection, and on the condition that he does not clear the search history on the device. Emsley had earlier admitted to breaching his sexual offences prevention order and two charges of making indecent images. Judge Gibson said Emsley had 'expressed some insight and some ambition to a future that does not involve the activity that has brought [him] time and time again before the courts'.","Paul Emsley, 47, of Lancashire, caught with vile stash of child porn .

Obama wants Republicans in the House of Representatives to call a vote on legislation that passed in the U.S. Senate last year, but any move toward what conservatives see as an 'amnesty' for more than 11 million lawbreakers has been a nonstarter. 'Whatever I do through the executive branch will not be as effective as we could do through legislation,' Obama told a small audience of tech startup entrepreneurs at a town hall-style event in Santa Monica, California. 'And it’s anybody’s guess how Republicans are thinking about this.' 'If they were thinking long-term politically, it is suicide for them not to do this. Because the demographics of the country are such where you are going to lose an entire generation of immigrants who are looking around and saying, ""You know what? That party does not seem to care much about me and my life"".' 'And I think the smarter Republicans understand this,' Obama jabbed. Obama spoke at Cross Campus, a hub for startup companies and entrepreneurs in Santa Monica, poking Republicans for ignoring demographic trends and stubbornly resisting immigration reform . Pivot: The president turned a narrow question about technical-skills work visas into an expansive stemwinder about the fate of 11 million illegal immigrants . 'Short term, though,' he claimed, 'they’ve got a problem in the tea party and others who oftentimes express virulently anti-immigrant sentiment.' The president conceded that 'two or three weeks of publicity' this summer that followed a flood of unaccompanied children and teens across the southern U.S. border 'fanned concern' about the impact of telling the world that America has changed its immigration calculus. But he insisted that 'it will happen over the next two years.' 'This is going to get fixed,' Obama vowed, 'and Congress will see the light, because the logic of it is – it’s too compelling.' He explained that while America's native-born population is reproducing at rates comparable to those in Europe and Asia, while first-generation U.S. immigrants are responsible for most of the population growth. 'China is aging. Japan is aging. Europe is aging,' he said. 'We are younger than them. And younger populations grow faster. You have more workers, fewer retirees.' Obama cited what he said was an economic consensus that if the Senate bill passed in 2013 were to become law, the U.S. would see 'faster growth, lower deficits, a more dynamic economy, more startups.' The president had been asked a question about a more narrow immigration issue related to limits on the H1B visa program, which high-tech industries want broadened to attract more high-skilled talent from overseas. Before launching into a political stemwinder, he pledged to make the H1B system more . efficient 'to encourage more folks to stay here.' But most of Obama's immigration talking points were aimed straight at the GOP, which hopes to expand its House majority and wrest back control of the Senate during what will be Obama's last two years in office. 'Deporter-in-chief': Obama regularly hears immigration reform demands from the Latino wing of his party, like these protesters who yelled outside his speech on Oct. 2 to the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute . Shifting the control of just six Senate seats would give Republicans the majority they seek – and create more intense headaches for Obama, who hasn't yet had to deal with a Republican-led Congress united against him. A Capitol Hill run exclusively by the Republican Party would be a death knell for Obama's immigration policy dreams, Senate aides say. It would also likely bring new obstacles to implementing the Obamacare medical insurance law, open new levels of scrutiny into a lengthening tally of scandals plaguing the White House, and roll back some of the administration's energy, environmental and homeland security policies. That outlook, however, depends upon internal dynamics in the GOP that see a hard-line tea party bloc battling against a more moderate majority over whether to risk an electoral backlash by toeing a conservative line. One senior aide to a western-U.S. Senate Republican told MailOnline on Thursday that immigration 'will be the last thing a Republican-led Senate would ever tackle in the next Congress.' 'I don't care what the go-along, get-along crowd says,' the official said. 'We've been down that road once, and the president never lets us hear the end of it.' 'Sometimes it's better just to let bad ideas die on the vine.'","President hosted a town hall-style meeting attended by tech entrepreneurs in Santa Monica, California .

"At the age of 107 America's oldest known veteran plans to enjoy this year's Memorial Day in what he describes as the familiar company of up to 12 cigars and some whiskey-stiffened coffee - simple luxuries for a man who's lived through a lot. 'I don’t know, some people might do something for me, but I’ll be glad just to sit down and rest,' World War II veteran Richard Arvine Overton told Fox News from the East Austin, Texas home he built after returning from active duty. Understandably Mr Overton is already more than entitled to some extra rest and relaxation after his service in the South Pacific from 1942 through 1945. But it's also been an especially busy past month while making appearances across the country. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Oldest living veteran: Richard Overton is seen celebrating his 107th birthday earlier this month outside his home he built in Austin, Texas after returning from active duty in World War II . Going strong: Mr Overton, strikingly pictured during his service, plans to spend a quiet Memorial Day at home, perhaps in the company of up to 12 cigars and some whiskey he attributes to keeping his muscles tender . 'You got to keep moving. You don't sit down and watch TV all the time. You have to keep moving,' Mr Overton told KVUE after being recognized for his service by Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell on May 9. Two days later he was busy celebrating his birthday and eight days later was being flown to Washington, D.C. for his first time to visit the WWII Memorial thanks to nonprofit Honor Flight, an organization that transports veterans to memorials free of cost. The organization strives to honor the veterans, particularly from WWII with over 800 of them said by the non-profit to be dying every day. '...our time to express our thanks to these brave men and women is running out,' the organization explains. 'I was very, very happy,' Mr Overton told Fox of his trip that included a visit to the Martin Luther King Jr Memorial. 'At my age and my strength, I’m able to stand up and do anything. My mind is good, so I’m able to do what I want,' he said. Mr Overton attributes active yard work and a single baby aspirin taken every day to his long life. It's the physical work he particularly emphasizes. But the whiskey’s good too, as he explains. 'Whiskey’s a good medicine. It keeps your muscles tender,' he said of his common regiment. Sadly, . he says a major part of this Memorial Day will be missing from his day, . as he reflects on everyone he served with, but has now outlived. ‘I know I had someone from my platoon until recently, but he passed so now I don’t have anyone that I know,’ he said. ‘So I feel lonesome by myself sometimes. I would love to ask some of them some questions, but nobody is here. Everybody’s passed.’ WATCH THE VIDEO HERE: .","Richard Arvine Overton served in the South Pacific from 1942 to 1945 before returning and building his current home in Austin, Texas .

"Forger: Peter Brightley faked his father's signature to gain more than £30,000 . A son forged his dead father’s signature to make himself the sole heir in his will, cheating five charities and his own brother out of more than £30,000. Solicitors raised the alarm when the fake signature by Peter Brightley, from Telford, Shropshire, bore no resemblance to his father Trevor's. But the 51-year-old was spared jail after a court heard he was a full-time carer for his disabled wife. Shrewsbury Crown Court heard Brightley was made the joint executor of his father's will in May 2008 together with a firm of solicitors in Lincolnshire. When Trevor died aged 75 in April last year, the solicitors asked Brightley if Trevor's most recent will, made in 2010, was the correct version. Instead of telling them the truth, Brightley sent back an 'updated' will making him the sole beneficiary of the £49,000 estate. He was in fact supposed to receive £11,000, with his brother Andrew left an equal share. Four charities - the Royal British Legion, St Barnabas Hospice in Lincoln, Barnado’s and the Prince’s Trust - were also due to receive £5,800 each, with pet charity PDSA owed another £2,500. Solicitors raised suspicions about the will's authenticity after they noticed the signature bore no resemblance to a previous one they had from Trevor. Brightley handed himself in to police two days later and admitted to forging the will and falsely receiving the £49,000. He pleaded guilty to forgery, fraud and theft when he appeared at Shrewsbury Crown Court yesterday. Cheated: St Barnabas Hospice in Lincoln, pictured, was one charity due to receive almost £5,800 . The court heard Brightley was deeply sorry - telling his barrister 'if they take me out and hang me that is not enough' - and had paid the solicitors £33,029 of the money he took. He still owes £3,158, but told the court he was not in a position to pay it back. Mark . Sharman, defending, said Brightley was a full-time carer for his . disabled wife and had been worried a reassessment would lead to the loss . of her benefits. He said he was also concerned about finding money to help his daughter put a deposit on a house. Mr . Sharman added: 'This is a man who, of his own volition, walked into a . police station at a time when police were not even aware of any . wrongdoing on his part.' Brightley was spared jail when Judge Peter Barrie handed him a 12-month prison sentence suspended for two years. He was also ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work.

"At least 40 people have been killed in a suicide bomb attack in the capital of Yemen. The blast struck as hundreds of people were arriving in Tahrir Square, in Sanaa, for a rally organised by the Shia rebel group, the Houthis. The attack comes as the country slides into chaos, triggered by the rebels' takeover of the capital last month. The bombing in Sanaa appeared to have been timed to cause a significant loss of life and was the deadliest in the capital since May 2012. Scroll down for video . Hundreds of people who had gathered for a rally in Tahrir Square, in Sanaa, flee after a suicide bomb went off . The blast struck as hundreds of people from the Houthis rebel group gathered in the capital to protest against the government's nomination for prime minister, despite his earlier resignation . A group of Yemenis tend to a wounded man following the suicide bomb attack in Tahrir Square, Sanaa . The Houthis took control of the capital on September 21 and it has been agreed that a new administration include the rebel group - they protested against the prime minister put forward to lead the new government . The Houthis - Members of rebel group, also known as Ansar Allah (Partisans of God), who adhere to a branch of Shia Islam known as Zaidism. They demand more political inclusion. Their strongholds include Saada, al-Jawf and the Jeraf district inside Sanaa. Al-Islah (Reform) - Sunni Islamist party that draws support and membership from heavily armed Sunni tribesmen, and is instrumental in rallying support behind the army and the government. Present in almost all of Yemen. The Houthis have identified the party as its arch-enemy. Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula - A merger of the Yemeni and Saudi branches of al-Qaeda. Seized large areas of territory in the south and the southeast after the uprising in 2011. Launched many attacks on armed forces and central authority establishments. Its power bases are Shabwah, Abyan and Hadramawt. The Southern Separatist Movement - Umbrella group that wants the south to break away from the north and reinstate the former Socialist state that existed until 1990. Led by Ali al-Beidh. The Houthis, also known as Ansar Allah (Partisans of God), adhere to a branch of Shia Islam known as Zaidism. Since the group seized control of Sanaa on September 21, efforts have been made to set up a new Yemeni government, which includes the Houthis. Once the new administration is nominated, the Houthis are meant to withdraw their forces from the capital and allow the police and army to resume their duties. However, the Houthis yesterday rejected President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi's nomination of Ahmed Awad bin Mubarak for the post of prime minister. The move had been announced on Tuesday after the president met the US ambassador to Yemen. Rebel leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi said  his group did not agree with the nomination and warned against 'blatant foreign interference'. Despite bin Mubarak resigning after only 33 hours in office, a demonstration in the capital was staged any way. The group gathered in Sanaa and chanted against the government and corruption. The scene of devastation in the aftermath of the fatal suicide attack - which killed at least 40 people . Men from the Houthis rebel group help one of the wounded that was struck by the suicide bomb - no group in the bitterly divided country has yet claimed responsibility for the attack . The bombing in the capital of Yemen, Sanaa, was the deadliest in the capital since May 2012 . Before the attack, the Houthis rebels had gathered to protest against President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi's nomination of Ahmed Awad bin Mubarak for the post of prime minister - he resigned after 33 hours in office . The sandals with blood stains are placed together at the site of the bombing as Yemeni security officials inspect the area . No group has said it was behind the bombings, but both bear similarities to previous attacks by al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which has vowed to fight the Houthis in defence of Sunnis. On Wednesday, officials accused the jihadist group of responsibility for simultaneous attacks on security and government offices in the southern town of Bayda that left at least nine people dead. A policeman who had been guarding a bank near Tahrir Square said he saw a man wearing an explosive belt approach a Houthi checkpoint. 'He then exploded amidst the [Houthi] security and ordinary people nearby,' he told the Reuters news agency. A photographer working for AFP described seeing the bodies of four children amid the carnage. Medics said dozens of people were also wounded by the blast. Although no group has said it is behind the attack, it bears similarities to previous attacks by terrorist group al-Qaeda, which has vowed to fight the Houthis in defence of Sunnis .

Yemeni security forces and Houthi rebels stand next to pools of blood following the attack . Later, a suicide bomb attack on an army checkpoint in the eastern province of Hadramawt left 20 soldiers dead. In the Hadramawt attack, a tank and two army vehicles were destroyed when a suicide bomber blew up his explosives-filled car at a checkpoint outside the city of Mukalla. Western and Gulf Arab countries are worried that instability in Yemen could strengthen al Qaeda and have supported a U.N.-backed political transition since 2012. The modern Republic of Yemen was created in 1990 when traditional North Yemen and Communist South Yemen merged after years of clashes. Since unification Yemen has been slowly modernising and opening up to the world, but still retains much of its tribal character. A short civil war in 1994 ended in defeat for separatist southerners, but regional tensions re-emerged in the summer of 2009 when government troops and Houthi rebels clashed in the north, killing hundreds and displacing more than a quarter of a million people. Yemen was hit by more serious political upheaval early in 2011 when protesters - inspired by the Arab Spring uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt - rallied against the three-decades-old rule of President Saleh. He stepped down as part of a deal brokered by neighbouring countries at the end of the year, ushering in a transitional period of political reforms. In the meantime, Yemen had become a major base for Islamic militants after the crackdown on al-Qaeda closed their training bases in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Since then government forces and al-Qaeda have battled for control of several towns in the south, while the US has used unmanned drones against the Islamists. The precariousness of the government's hold was dramatically demonstrated in September 2014, when Houthi rebels swept into Sanaa and seized control of the capital. Since the group seized control of Sanaa, efforts have been made to set up a new Yemeni government, which includes the Houthis.","At least 40 people have been killed in a suicide bomb attack in Sanaa, Yemen .

"Germany began their World Cup campaign with a 4-0 rout of Cristiano Ronaldo’s Portugal on Monday and immediately vowed to lift the trophy in honour of stricken Formula One star Michael Schumacher. A Thomas Muller hat-trick lit up Salvador’s Arena Fonte Nova as Portugal were flattened by a brilliant German performance and the sending-off of defender Pepe. Afterwards, Germany’s players revealed they had been heartened by news that Schumacher had left hospital for the first time since a skiing accident left him in a coma in France at the end of last year. Heartening: Germany's players were boosted by the news Michael Schumacher has left hospital for the first time since falling into a coma following a skiing accident . Arsenal striker Lukas Podolski — a close friend of the driver — said: ‘It is important to all of us to hear the news that he’s come out of hospital. He’s doing well and he’s getting better and it’s really good news. ‘Of course it helped us. When you hear the news about a good friend it always helps and you get a little bit of a boost and I was very happy when I heard. ‘He’s a good guy and he’s also crazy about football. Maybe he watched the game or he knew about the result.  Yeah if we win the title of course it would also be for a good friend as well as ourselves.’ Germany surged into a two-goal lead in the first half and were able to switch to cruise control once Pepe had been dismissed for a headbutt on Muller. It seemed the correct decision and the Real Madrid star will now miss the rest of the group stages. Happy: Germany's players come together to celebrate the hat-trick by Thomas Muller (left) Portugal coach Paulo Bento appeared to suggest Serbian referee Milorad Mazic was biased against his team, not only for that but for the 12th minute penalty that allowed Germany to take the lead. ‘The first half of the game — apart from our mistakes — had some things on behalf of the referee that penalised us,’ said Bento. ‘The sending off seemed to be forced and the penalty was the same. They were two things that led to us chasing the game. ‘I never said it was only the referee’s fault. We made mistakes in defence and we showed a lack of accuracy. ‘Compare that to the accuracy of the Germans and you see the difference. ‘But there seemed to be some bias towards the Germans. The first was the penalty and the second was the sending off.’ 'Unusual': Thomas Muller says he has a vague recollection of this incident which led to Pepe's sending off . Muller was able to offer his own view of the red card incident after being presented with the man of the match award after the game. He said: ‘As far as the sending off is concerned it’s unusual. I didn’t see a replay. Things went very fast. I have a vague recollection. ‘His hand struck me in the face. I fell on my back and he approached me with his head towards mine. I can’t really recollect. ‘I can’t say if it’s a red as that’s not up to me. But the entire action from Pepe was unnecessary. ‘I have scored a hat trick and that doesn’t happen every day. I have had a good run in World Cups and I wanted to carry that on.’ Accusation: Portugal coach Paulo Bento said there seemed to be 'bias' towards Germany from the officials . Germany would already appear to have one foot in the last 16 while Portugal must beat USA and Ghana in their remaining group games to progress. German coach Joachim Low said: ‘Muller has an instinct to create danger and he scores from situations that you don’t expect. ‘He makes diagonal runs and it’s hard for opponents to track him. ‘He is unorthodox. You can’t predict them and as an opponent he is difficult to face. ‘He has one aim and that is to score a goal. He is an innate scorer.’","Lukas Podolski says news Schumacher had left hospital following his coma .

"A Brazilian woman has fled to her embassy in Oslo with her three-year-old daughter after Norwegian child protection services threatened to take the child into care. Vitoria Alves Jesumary, 37, a Brazilian native, claims social services tried to take her daughter Sofia because she is not ‘eating like a Norwegian’. Ms Jesumary has now been hiding at the embassy for a week and is refusing to leave until she is allowed to return to Brazil with her daughter. In hiding: Vitoria Alves Jesumary has fled to the Brazilian Embassy in Oslo after claiming social services tried to take her daughter because she is not 'eating like a Norwegian' (stock image) Ms Jesumary recently divorced Sofia’s father, a Norwegian man of Chilean descent, and the custody battle and troublesome split led to her contacting welfare services for help, but instead was threatened with losing her child, she claims. A friend of Ms Jesumary says she was told the reason for Sofia being taken into care is because of her eating habits and dominating character. However, the validity of this statement has been questioned as the mother does not speak English or Norwegian. ‘Put simply, it's an abuse of authority,"" Ana Lucia Lima, a pastor at a pentecostal church in Oslo, told The Local. ‘They say she's not eating like it's normal to do here in Norway and that she's developing a dominating character among her friends. They say this is because she's not getting good parenting.’ Demands: Ms Jesumary is refusing to leave the embassy until Norway allows her to return to Brazil with her three-year-old daughter Sofia . Child Protection Services were contacted by local media, but refused to comment on individual cases. Brazilian embassy representative Francisco Chagas Catunda Resende told state broadcaster NRK that although Brazil respected Norway's laws and institutions, it is in Sofia's best interest  that she and her mother move to Brazil. Out of all the Scandinavian countries, Norway can pride itself on some of the most unusual dishes. - Smalahove, 'Sheep's head', a dish still enjoyed in West Norway before Christmas time, sees a whole sheep's head - tongue and all - dried, smoked, boiled and then enjoyed whole. - Væraballer, ram's testicles, are a traditional starter to the 'sheep's head' main dish and served with sour cream. Waste not want not. It is not very common in modern Norway . - Fiskemølje is another feast served in wintertime. Pieces of boiled cod are served up in a broth of cod liver and roe. - The Scandinavian climate resulted in a lot of traditional Norwegian food involve fermenting and curing to last through the winter months. Rakfisk, traditionally made from trout, is fermented for several months before it is served up on flatbread with onions and a dollop of sour cream. Its smell, like that of its Swedish cousin 'surströmming', is not for the fainthearted. ‘We’re trying to resolve this case diplomatically with Norwegian authorities,’ he said. ‘It is a very uncomfortable situation for the embassy.’ The Brazilian embassy has met with representatives from the local CPS as well as the Chilean consulate, Mr Resende added. Sofia’s father told the state broadcaster that he also supports Ms Jesumary’s wish to travel to Brazil. ‘As I see it, it’s the only solution. We don’t think this can be solved in court,’ he told NRK. The tale of Ms Jesumary and her daughter echoes a well-published case from 2012 of Norwegian CPS removing a five-month-old and a three-year-old from their Indian parents. The parents claimed the children had been taken from them as a result of them sleeping in their parents’ bed and being fed by hand. The case appeared on India’s largest English language TV station, New Delhi Television and was cabled out across world media's as 'The Nightmare in Norway'. However, following an intervention by the Indian government, the father admitted that his wife had 'a serious psychological problem' which had led to the children being taken into care. The children now live in India with their uncle.","Vitoria Alves Jesumary, 37, is hiding at the Brazilian Embassy in Oslo .

"Kelly Brook's fiance will not face any further charges over the reasons he gave for crashing a van full of dead badgers during the controversial cull. David McIntosh, who is known for appearing in TV series Gladiator as ‘Tornado’, had been employed to take the dead creatures for disposal as part of the badger cull in Gloucestershire. But as the 28-year-old former Royal Marine drove his VW Transporter van to a furnace in the middle of the night, he swerved and smashed into a bus stop. David McIntosh, 28, the fiance of model Kelly Brook will not face any further charges over the reasons he gave for crashing a van full of dead badgers during the controversial cull. Pictured: The couple in Los Angeles yesterday . He was fined and given six penalty points at court but in a statement said he lost control when a radio - which police used to pass on intelligence about the location of anti-cull protesters - fell under the brakes. The claims triggered a denial from police meaning McIntosh faced a potential perjury charge after the hearing. But Gloucestershire Police have now said they are taking no further action - leading to criticism from anti-cull campaigners over the validity of the claims. Scene: The bus shelter in Gloucester which was damaged when a van load of culled badgers crashed into it . He claims to have lost control when a radio - which police used to pass on intelligence about the location of anti-cull protesters - fell under the breaks . McIntosh crashed after falling asleep during the night shift in Gloucester city centre just before 1am on September 29 . A spokesman for the force said: 'We are not taking any further action in connection with it. 'We were looking at whether there there should be any further action as we didn’t agree with what was said in court. 'I believe the court would have had to make a complaint - that was one of the reasons [for not taking action]. 'Further action was deemed not to be proportionate.' But anti-cull protestor Peter Martin said they always accepted McIntosh’s claims were true and added: 'The police have been very cosy with the cull operatives all along - no wonder he’s off the hook.' Making their point: Anti badger-cull protestors outside Stroud Magistrates' Court where McIntosh was fined . McIntosh crashed after falling asleep during the night shift in Gloucester city centre just before 1am on September 29. He admitted driving without due care and attention and not having a valid licence. Passenger John Parker - who suffered bruised ribs, thigh, face and wrist in the crash - told the court he was checking Facebook on his phone when he felt the van change direction. District Judge Joti Bopa-Rai at Stroud Magistrates Court said: 'It is either that he has fallen asleep or been distracted.' McIntosh, of Altrincham, Cheshire, was fined £91, plus a £20 victim surcharge and £30 prosecution costs.

The 'Bali bombings' on October 12, 2002, killed 202 people, including 81 Australians, and injured hundreds more. At the time of the blast, Georgia Lysaght's brother Scott was with teammates from the Jakarta ISCI Dragons rugby club, where they were playing in a local tournament. The team had just pulled up in three taxis out the front of the Sari Club, where the bombing occurred, when the blast went off. Scott was killed immediately by the car bomb, and none at the head of the convoy survived. He left behind his wife of nine years, Melissa, and their newborn daughter Madeleine. Now his sister, a research fellow with the Centre for Transnational Crime Prevention at Woollongong University, is urging Tony Abbott to help the voices of moderate and tolerant Australians be heard, over those who would pursue initiatives which would divide the nation. 'Mr Abbott, during this time of international uncertainty and Australian involvement in what is a terribly violent conflict, I am appealing to you not to run a campaign of fear,' she wrote on Mamamia. 'For every cross-cultural friendship, for every conversation started rather than an accusation launched, for every social media site promoting unity against violence, we can hope to dampen radicalism in our own way. This is the ultimate non-violent protest.' This is the very point which she is calling the Australian Prime Minister to remember, stating that 'the government’s efforts to prevent a terror attack in Australia must include strategies that promote cross-cultural knowledge, respect, and tolerance,' she wrote. 'I felt sick when Australia’s terror alert was raised, and media coverage increased on the possibility of a terror attack in Australia,' 'I felt sick not because of the steps the government had undertaken, but because once again I witnessed a surge of racism and bigotry across social media and on the comments section of news sites.' Reflecting on the responses of everyday Australians to the Bali bombings, Ms Lysaght said that whilst she was overwhelmed by the support and kindness she and her family received, she witnessed a large proportion of others respond with racism, persecution and hatred. Scott Lysaght was killed in the bombing of the Sari nightclub, where 88 Australian lost their lives . Fire blazes as club goers watch the wreckage of the terrorist bombings in Indonesia in 2002, where Ms Lysaght's brother Scott was killed . Ms Lysaght said that her brother's death motivated her to undertake a PhD which focused on the case study of Indonesia, in order that she could understand more fully that the terrorists did not represent the nation . Ms Lysaght recalled one incident where a caller on talkback radio suggested the government round 'them' (the terrorists) up in the Melbourne Cricket Ground for the families of the victims to beat up, sickening her. 'I did not want any act of violence, racism, or bigotry to be justified in my brother’s name, my family’s name, or my name,' she wrote. More recently, Ms Lysaght said she was horrified by the public's reaction to Australian Muslims, including a rise in attacks which have included  the 'vandalism of mosques, a baby’s pram being kicked, a mother being spat on, and a pig’s head being impaled on a cross.' Ms Lysaght said that her brother's death motivated her to undertake a PhD which focused on the case study of Indonesia, in order that she could understand more fully that the terrorists did not represent the nation. 'After Scott died, I made the deliberate decision to act as a proponent of peace in my own small way, by actively engaging with people from cross-cultural backgrounds, exercising respect and tolerance, standing up to racism, and expanding my knowledge about the world around me.' In her final words to the Prime Minister, she urges him not to divide the nation in fear, and risk alienating minorities further. 'Please help the voices of moderate, tolerant Australians be heard so that we may be unflinching in our support of one another to strengthen our resolve and resilience against the darker forces in this world,' she wrote. Ms Lysaght is urging Prime Minister Tony Abbott not to divide the nation in fear and risk alienating minorities .","Georgia Lysaght's brother Scott was killed in the 2002 Bali bombings .

"A woman has made a miraculous escape after a 12-foot-long shark bit her hand and tried to drag her out to sea. Mckenzie Clark, 34, was surfing in North Kohala, Hawaii, on Friday morning when the shark launched out of the sea and clamped down on her left hand. Her friend Brian Wargo turned back to see the shark lifting her up out of the water on her board as it wildly lunged at her body. Lucky escape: Mckenzie Clark (left) survived with a bitten hand and board after a shark launched at her and her friend Brian Wargo (right) who punched it five times before it swam away in North Kohala, Hawaii . 'I was just scared. I didn't know what to do. The first time it bumped me I thought, ""What's happening? Did I hit a rock?"" I was kind of in disbelief. It just happened so fast,' Clark told Hawaii News Now. It pulled Miss Clark off her board and bit her hand, which she ripped back, tearing off the skin. Mr Wargo grabbed the shark's dorsal fin and punched the beast five times in the nose. After the fifth strike, it turned away and disappeared under the water. Menacing: Mr Wargo described hearing screams then turning to see the shark lifting Miss Clark up into the air . Danger: Signs have now been erected around the shore in North Kohala warning passers-by of sharks . They rushed to hospital where Miss Clark received two stitches. She is now awaiting a skin graft operation to fully repair the damage. The board was left with three rows of tooth marks.

"Angela Douglas was convicted of murder at Plymouth Crown Court in April and given a life sentence with a minimum tariff of 12 years . A mother-of-two who cooked Sunday lunch for her family before going upstairs to murder her own mother has had her jail sentence halved on appeal. Angela Douglas, 49, had downed two-and-half bottles of wine when she suffocated Anne Matthews, 73, with a pillow saying she wanted to end her pain. Douglas was convicted of murder at Plymouth Crown Court in April and given a life sentence with a minimum tariff of 12 years. But today, three senior judges at the Court of Appeal in London said the tariff was 'excessive' and reduced it to seven years. The decision means Douglas will be free to apply for parole in 2020, taking into account time served. Lord Justice McCombe said: 'She did have a genuine belief that what she was doing was an act of mercy and there had been no premeditation.' Plymouth Crown Court heard how Douglas and her partner Shane had visited her parents on April 28 last year. She cooked the family Sunday lunch, drank wine and took her mother a cup of tea and biscuits in bed. Her father then went upstairs and found her kneeling and crying over her unconscious mother. An ambulance was called but when paramedics entered her bedroom Douglas told them: 'I don’t want you to do anything, she’s been through enough.' The medics also noted that Douglas was drunk and slurring her words. Further tests found she was heavily intoxicated. The mother-of-two had her jail sentence halved by three senior judges at London's Court of Appeal today . Douglas, a former nursery nurse, claimed she was acting ‘out of love’ after watching her elderly mother struggle with emphysema. But the pensioner, a former smoker who weighed less than five stone, was not terminally ill. Douglas confessed to killing her mother but denied murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility. She claimed a stress-related illness meant she was not in control of her own actions. In April this year, a jury at Plymouth Crown Court found her guilty of murder in less than an hour. In April, a jury at Plymouth Crown Court (pictured) found Douglas guilty - but her sentence has now been cut . Today, her barrister, Paul Dunkels QC, said the 12-year term she had initially been ordered to serve was too long, given the mitigating features of the case. He said: 'She was distressed by the deterioration in her mother's health and had told others that she hated watching her mother die. 'Her character was such that she found dealing with stress and anxiety difficult and that affected her thinking about her mother's condition. 'The killing was not planned or premeditated, with the idea only coming to her as she lay on the bed next to her mother on that evening, the appellant then being in an emotional and intoxicated state.'","Angela Douglas, 49, smothered 73-year-old Anne Matthews with a pillow .

"The former president of Ukraine used 'hired killers, kidnappers and thugs' to attack opposition activists during the anti-government protests in February, officials say. There is also evidence Russia's security service was brought in to assist  their Ukrainian counterparts in the clashes in Kiev which left more than 100 people dead. In addition, a dozen members of an elite riot police unit  have been detained on suspicion of shooting protesters, Prosecutor General Oleh Makhnitsky said. Admitting wrong: Local riot police kneel as they apologize to Lviv residents for taking part in an operation against anti-government protesters in Kiev, Ukraine in February . Claiming innocence: Former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych is vehemently denying that he hired snipers to attack protesters in Kiev before he was ousted as leader . Mr Yanukovych fled the capital, Kiev, after the culmination of the violence in February, precipitating the fall of his government. The identity of the snipers believed to be responsible for most of the deaths is subject of bitter disagreement. The interim government says Mr Yanukovych ordered snipers to be deployed - a charge he has denied. Opponents of the current leadership say snipers were organised by opposition leaders trying to whip up outrage. Mr Yanukovych said he ‘was wrong’ in inviting Russian troops into Crimea, which was swiftly annexed by Moscow following a referendum in which reunion with Russia was backed by 97 per cent of those who voted. Sniper proof: Volunteer medic Olesya Zhukovska ,21, left, was shot in her neck by a sniper bullet, in Independence Square, Kiev, in February . Still in denial? This candid image shows a riot police standing next to a sniper firing from a fortified position in the direction of activists in Kiev during the protests . Lethal violence: Several people were killed by snipers during the anti-government protests in Kiev earlier this year . An activist mourns the fellow protesters killed in clashes with riot police in Kiev, Ukraine on 20 February . Ukraine's fledging government and Western leaders have expressed concern about a recent build-up of Russian forces near the Ukrainian border. President Vladimir Putin told German Chancellor Angela Merkel last week that the troops were there for military exercises and that one battalion has already left. Mr Yanukovych did not answer several questions about whether he would support any Russian move into other areas of Ukraine on the pretext of protecting ethnic Russians. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov today offered further assurances, telling reporters that Russian troops ‘will be returning to the place of their permanent quarters as soon as other participants of the exercise have completed their tasks’. Mr Lavrov, however, accused the Ukrainian government ‘and their patrons in the West of blowing this out of proportion,’ adding that Russia did not violate any international norms by sending additional troops to its own borders. US Air Force Gen Philip M Breedlove, who commands all Nato forces in Europe, said Russia has 40,000 troops along the border with Ukraine, and that they are capable of attacking by land and air on 12 hours' notice. The sheer size and posture of its forces are destabilising although the Russians' plans remain unknown to Nato, he said.","Evidence Russian security service assisted Ukraine during protests .

"Beko, which has its UK headquarters in Watford, Hertfordshire, has pleaded guilty to 23 charges of failing to notify the Trading Standards about a potential deadly risk from its cookers (file picture) White goods manufacturer Beko has been fined more than £75,000 after admitting it failed to reveal to authorities for four years that thousands of its cookers were potentially unsafe and could cause deadly carbon monoxide poisoning. The Turkish firm, which is one of the world's biggest kitchen appliance manufacturers, was aware from 2009 that 23 different models of its cookers produced the deadly gas from its grill if used in very particular circumstances. The domestic appliance giant, which has its UK headquarters in Watford, Hertfordshire, knew of a risk which can occur when some of its cookers are converted for use with LPG gas but didn't inform Hertfordshire County Council Trading Standards until August last year following an ITV News investigation. Andrew Mullen, Beko's quality manager for the UK and Ireland, yesterday pleaded guilty to 23 counts of failing to notify Trading Standards about the fault on behalf of the company at Watford Magistrates' Court. On behalf of Beko, Mr Mullen admitted that the company failed in its obligation to notify the authority about the potential risk to the cookers, after concerns arose that they were not 'safe products' if used with bottled gas and with the door closed. The manufacturer's instructions warn customers not to keep the door shut when using the grill oven but the company failed to inform the Trading Standards of the risk when using the LPG kit - which converts the appliance from using natural gas to liquid petroleum. The company had faced a total of 69 charges brought by the council but the remainder were dropped following the guilty pleas. Under safety regulations, the company is required to tell the local authority of problems involving its products as soon as they are discovered. Prosecutor Miles Bennett said: 'When they are aware they should notify them forthwith that their products are unsafe. 'Once it was decided for it [the cooker models] to be converted into LPG it posed a substantial risk if the grill door was kept in the shut position when it was on, because there was a substantial risk of a build up of carbon monoxide. There's a substantial risk of injury and death.' Of the company's failures, Mr Bennett added: 'It went on, not for weeks or months, but years from February 2009 to July 2013. 'Beko, in February 2009, realised there was a problem with some of their cookers and as Beko's HQ is in Watford, Hertfordshire Council Trading Standards takes a role as its ""Home Authority"". 'If there is an issue or problem it should notify Hertfordshire County Council so it can notify all other authorities. 'The local authority can't do its job properly if it's not notified by the company. 'They had been aware that the 23 models posed a risk and we say a substantial risk because of carbon monoxide.' Michael Uberoi, defending, said the company admitted that there had been a 'genuine oversight' to notify the authority. He said the company had contacted owners of the affected conversion kits but had only failed to notify the council because of the oversight. Beko was fined £77,660 and ordered to pay £11,000 in costs after admitting the failings. Following the hearing, the company confirmed 23 models of cooker – all made before 2009 – were found to be potentially dangerous when converted for use with bottled gas and used with the door closed. Andrew Mullen, Beko's quality manager for the UK and Ireland, pleaded guilty to 23 counts of failing to notify the Trading Standards about the potential risk on behalf of the company at Watford Magistrates' Court (pictured) Of the 2,320 converter kits provided to households by Beko, more than half have been traced and the owners informed of the dangers by the kitchen appliance giant. However, a total of 836 remain unaccounted for. A company spokesman said: 'Beko acknowledges it should have notified Hertfordshire Trading Standards about the LPG conversion kits issue as soon it was aware of the matter. 'It accepts responsibility for not doing so. Finding these LPG kits was Beko's priority at the time and its efforts are continuing through a wide range of activities. 'It is important to record that the charges relate solely to Beko's communications with Hertfordshire Trading Standards around the LPG kit issue, not its extensive activities to trace the kits. 'These LPG kits are designed to convert specific models of pre-2009 Beko-manufactured mains gas cookers to run on bottled gas. 'We are only looking for a limited number of LPG kits in relation to this issue. None of Beko's current range of cookers is affected.' Richard Thake, cabinet member for community safety at Hertfordshire County Council, said he was pleased the court had taken a 'serious view' of the matter. He said: 'I am deeply disappointed that it has proven necessary for us to initiate court proceedings in this case. 'The fact that this prosecution has been successful is gratifying and the level of penalty imposed, plus the fact that costs have been awarded, is an indication that the court has taken a serious view of this matter.

"Getting a $2,000 tip as a waitress means hitting the jackpot. Receiving it twice is almost unheard of. But what happens if you despise the person leaving behind the cash and everything they stand for? For Merritt Tierce, a recently published author and former waitress at upscale Dallas steakhouse Nick and Sam's, the answer was simple - you donate that money to a cause that person equally despised. Scroll down for video . Write caption here . A few years ago Tierce twice waited on outspoken conservative radio announcer Rush Limbaugh, who left her $2,000 tips each time, once with 20 $100 bills. But she didn't want to keep it. 'That was like blood money to me,' Tierce told The Dallas Morning News. Tierce was the former executive director at the Texas Equal Access Fund, which provides money to women who can't afford to get abortions. Limbaugh believes abortion is 'at the root of our cultural rot' and that 'we need the taxes of 52 million people that don't exist'. Tierce said it felt right to her to give the money to the TEA Fund. 'It felt like laundering the money in a good way,' she told the newspaper. 'He's such an obvious target for any feminist or sane person. 'It was really bizarre to me that he gave me $2,000, and he's evil incarnate in some ways.'

"They followed all the procedures of a typical 'man overboard'-type rescue. But despite mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and CPR, there was nothing that could be done for a man found floating in Lake Michigan this week.

"Rush Limbaugh offended many today when he used a rape analogy to explain one of President Obama's current initiatives. The president is supporting a bill on filibuster reform which would change the required votes to approve judicial and executive nominees from 60 to just 51. On his radio show Friday, Limbaugh used rape as a means to explain the bill to listeners. Controversial comparison: Rush Limbaugh started controversy today when he used a rape analogy to explain filibuster reform to his radio show listeners . 'Let's forget the Senate for a minute,' Limbaugh said. He asked viewers to imagine a room with six men and four women. He says that the group has a rule that men cannot rape women. The group also has a rule that requires six votes to change any rule. 'Every not and then, some lunatic in the group proposes to change the rule to allow women to be raped. But they were never able to get six votes for it. There were always the four women voting against it and they always found two guys. 'Well, the guy that kept proposing that women be raped finally got tired of it, and he was in the majority and he was the one that [said], ""You know what? We're going to change that rule. Now all we need is five."" The women protest, but the man responds that they have the power to do it, because 'We're the majority'. Filibuster reform: President Obama is currently supporting an effort to lower the required votes on judicial and executive nominees . 'Can the women be raped?' Limbaugh asks. 'Well all it would take then is half of the room. You can change the rule to say three you can change the rule to say three people want it, it's going to happen.' A negative reaction to Limbaugh's statements immediately started popping up on Twitter from politicians like DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz to journalists like the Guardian's Ana Marie Cox. This isn't the first time the conservative talking head has offended women with his politics. In 2012, Limbaugh called law student Sandra Fluke a 'slut' and a 'prostitute' after she testified at a hearing about contraception. He later apologized for his statements. But in response to today's statements, Limbaugh's reps were less than conciliatory. 'Rush Limbaugh has spent 25 years illustrating absurdity by using extrapolated analogies,' a spokesman told the Daily Caller. 'Anyone who calls this anything different than that is simply lying.'","The conservative radio personality used a rape analogy to explain filibuster reform to his listeners today .

"Sandra Fluke, the contraception activist who shot from obscurity to the national spotlight in 2012 when she argued that her Catholic law school should be required to provide birth control to female students for free, said Wednesday that she's decided not to run for Congress in California. The newly minted 'social justice attorney' was one of three Democrats who had petitioned the California Democratic Party for its endorsement in the 33rd District election set for nine months from now. Henry Waxman, who has served in Congress since 1975, is vacating that seat at the end of his current term. Fluke will run instead for a state Senate seat held by Democrat Ted Lieu, who is running for Waxman's seat. 'I am extremely moved by the outpouring of local and national support I have received since I announced that I was considering running for office,' Fluke said in a statement. 'While I strongly considered offering my candidacy for Congress, I feel there is a better way to advance the causes that are important to our community.' Attorney Sandra Fluke made her name as a feminist advocate for universal access to contraceptives, but she'll need a broader platform is she wants to be a member of Congress . U.S. Rep. Henry Waxman once chaired the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, but announced his retirement in an era where Democrats have little chance of returning to the majority any time soon . The single-issue activist famously threw a monkey wrench into the 2012 political campaign season with claims that Republicans were engaged in a 'war on women.' House Republicans refused last year to add her name to a witness list in a February hearing about exceptions to the Affordable Care Act's contraceptive mandate for religiously affiliated organizations. When Democrats convened their own meeting a week later to hear her speak, Fluke argued that Georgetown University, a Roman Catholic institution, should be required to include birth control services in health insurance plan for students, despite church teachings opposing contraception. She argued at the time that 40 per cent of female Georgetown law students endured financial hardship because they were forced to pay for birth control themselves, at a cost of $3,000 per year. Within a day news reports confirmed that commercial pharmacies within a few miles of the university offered generic birth control pills for $9 per month. If she follows through on her candidacy for state Senate, Fluke will have to come up with a $953 filing fee to establish her candidacy. California allows candidates to submit 3,000 petition signatures instead of paying the fee, but the deadline looms on February 20. Conservative talk radio icon Rush Limbaugh made his own national headlines two years ago by commenting that Fluke was asking taxpayers to compensate her for the financial costs of her sexual activity, making her equivalent to a prostitute. Fluke 'essentially says that she must be paid to have sex – what does that make her?' Limbaugh asked on his radio show. 'It makes her a slut, right? It makes her a prostitute. She wants to be paid to have sex.' No dittos: Rush Limbaugh got into hot water for calling Fluke a 'slut' after she demanded financial compensation to cover the cost of birth control pills at Georgetown University law school. He later apologized under pressure from fleeing advertisers, but Fluke wouldn't accept his words . Sandra Fluke thrust herself into the national spotlight as a single-issue feminist activist, but will have to grapple with a wder range of issues as she fights a widening slate of Democratic rivals . He later apologized publicly for the comments after some sponsors threatened to pull their ads from his broadcasts. 'I sincerely apologize to Ms. Fluke for the insulting word choices,' he wrote.  But Fluke refused to accept the apology. 'I don't think that a statement like this issued, saying that his choice of words was not the best, changes anything,' she said during an appearance on ABC's 'The View' program, 'and especially when that statement is issued when he's under significant pressure from his sponsors.' The resulting national furor, and Fluke's expertly played victim role, catapulted her to Democratic stardom and an invitation to speak at the party's 2012 national convention. In addition to Fluke, two other Democrats have thrown their hats into the ring for Waxman's House seat. Golden boy? California Democratic state Sen. Ted Lieu is serious about succeeding Henry Waxman, and the 40-something Taiwanese immigrant's steady rise through the ranks has brought him a strong political apparatus just in time for a closely watched campaign . Ted Lieu, a Taiwanese-American state senator since 2011 and a member of the state assembly for six years before that, is a left-leaning political hybrid who spans the chasm between social liberals and pro-business Democrats. The Air Force Reserve lieutenant colonel authored legislation, the first of its kind, that bans mental health professionals from trying to 'convert' gay teens into heterosexuals through specialized therapy. He also sponsored a landmark bill allowing schools to discipline cyber-bullying students. Lieu also received the California Small Business Association's highest rating last month, in part because of his opposition to state taxes that hit small businesses retroactively. His current state legislative district encompasses 86 per cent of the congressional district. 'All politics is local,' he told MailOnline, echoing the late House speaker Tip O'Neill. Raised Roman Catholic and educated in Catholic schools in Cleveland, Ohio, Lieu hasn't staked out a position on Obamacare's narrow exceptions for religious objectors. A Lieu adviser in Sacramento told MailOnline that 'he's absolutely serious' about running, even with the controversial Fluke grabbing may of the headlines. 'My read is, he's in it for the long haul, and he's not going anywhere,' said the adviser, who declined to be named because he is not authorized to speak about political campaigns. Lieu told the Santa Monica Lookout, a local newspaper, that running 'was a very difficult decision made quickly; withing 24 hours of Waxman's retirement announcement. 'I cannot compare myself to Congressmember Waxman,' he reflected. 'He is a living legend.' The third entrant in the race who has officially applied for the state Democratic Party's endorsement is Wendy Greuel, the City of Los Angeles' former financial controller and the loser in a tight 2013 mayoral election. Fluke introduced President Barack Obama during a re-election campaign rally in Denver on August 8, 2012. She has managed to parlay her brief window of activist fame into what could be a lasting political career . Lightweight? Marianne Williamson, author of books on miracles, prayer, and a spiritual approach to weight loss, was already in the hunt to replace Waxman before he announced his retirement from Congress . A moderate who already has the backing of Senator Barbara Boxer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Greuel launched her campaign this week for the 33rd District seat with a flurry of endorsements, announcing one on the 33rd minute of each hour Monday on her social media accounts. She emailed 40,000 supporters at 9:33 Monday morning to to announce her intention to succeed Waxman. 'Now that he's decided to retire, I'm rolling up my sleeves to carry on his amazing legacy,' Greuel wrote. The Twitter hashtag #ReadyForWendy is crisscrossing California's political circles, bringing with it comparisons to the 'Ready For Hillary' super PAC gather support for a Hillary Clinton presidential run. But unlike the former secretary of state, Greuel is seen as politically moderate when compared with the departing Waxman. That could serve her well in a district that has trended less and less liberal since the last congressional redistricting in 2010. Waxman, who enjoyed landslide re-election margins throughout most of his career, won his last race by just 8 points over Bill Bloomfield, a moderate businessman and political independent who co-founded the category-confounding 'NoLabels' political movement. Bloomfield is expected to enter the race to replace Waxman this year. So is Marianne Williamson, a far-left new-age guru and best-selling author popular with Californians of the generation that can correctly spell 'Haight-Ashbury.' 'The trajectory of corporatism is already wreaking havoc on our environment, our civil liberties, our economy and even our food supply,' Williamson complains on her campaign website. Would-be Los Angeles mayor Wendy Greuel is definitely running for Congress, hoping to avoid another second-place finish this time around . 'When banks, oil companies, chemical companies, health insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, food companies, military manufacturers and prison builders are able to influence our lawmakers so disproportionately to the influence wielded by average citizens, we have a problem.' She has no illusions about the possibility that the time for unreconstructed radicals may have come and gone, even in California. 'I'm sure they’re going to say I’m a new age nutcase, dragon lady, lightweight thinker,' she told The New York Times at a recent book-signing that doubled as a mini-campaign rally. In a district that now includes more Republicans than ever, one autograph-seeker shrugged in agreement that universal health care, universal preschool and a universal ban on nuclear energy – all things Waxman has championed – won't play the way they used to. 'You need new voters, I think,' the man said.","Fluke had put herself on a short list of Democrats seeking their state party's endorsement to succeed retiring 40-year Rep. Henry Waxman .

Gabriel, an award-winning musician and prolific human rights activist, said he didn't want his song Sledgehammer to play in the background while Limbaugh launched an attack on Georgetown student Sandra Fluke, calling her a 'slut' and a 'prostitute'. A Facebook post from Gabriel's representative stated: 'Peter was appalled to learn that his music was linked to Rush Limbaugh's extraordinary attack on Sandra Flute. 'It is obvious from anyone that knows Peter's work that he would never approve such a use. 'He has asked his representatives to make sure his music is withdrawn and especially from these unfair aggressive and ignorant comments.' The comment, posted on Monday, was 'liked' by more than 6,000 people. A later post from the musician, who has received the Nobel Man of Peace award, explained: 'I am a real believer in the Freedom of Speech and would defend Rush Limbaugh’s right to mouth off about almost anything. 'I just don’t like my work being used as the bed track for prejudice or hatred.' The backlash against Limbaugh has . intensified in recent days, as more than 40 advertisers dropped their . support of his radio program and two stations have pulled the plug on . it. Scroll down for video . Taking a stand: Gabriel asked for his music to be removed from the Rush Limbaugh show after the talk show host called a law student a 'prostitute' Limbaugh told listeners today that 'everything’s cool' despite the mass exodus, according to ABC. He said: 'Nobody is losing money here, including us... We don’t get any revenue from ‘em anyway. The whole effort is to dispirit you.' Even the President weighed into controversy. During President Obama's press conference yesterday at the White House, he had little to say about the controversy at first. Obama said: 'I'm not going to comment on what sponsors decide to . do. I'm not going to comment on either . the economics or the politics of it. 'I . don't know what's in Rush Limbaugh's heart, so I'm not going to comment on the . sincerity of his apology.' But he said that he was compelled to offer his support to Fluke after . considering his own children, daughters Malia, 13, and Sasha, 10. Controversy: During his first press conference of 2012, President Obama weighed in on the uproar surrounding radio host Rush Limbaugh, right, after he called Sandra Fluke a 'slut' on the air . Obama said: 'The reason I called Ms Fluke is because I . thought about Malia and Sasha, and one of the things I want them to do as they . get older is to engage in issues they care about, even ones I may not agree . with them on.' Reaction: Georgetown University law student and activist Sandra Fluke speaks during an appearance on the daytime talk show, 'The View' about the comments he made on his programme . He added: 'I want them to be able to speak their mind in a . civil and thoughtful way. 'And I don't . want them attacked or called horrible names because they're being good . citizens. 'And I wanted Sandra to know . that I thought her parents should be proud of her, and that we want to send a . message to all our young people that being part of a democracy involves . argument and disagreements and debate, and we want you to be engaged, and . there's a way to do it that doesn't involve you being demeaned and insulted, . particularly when you’re a private citizen'. Some 42 firms were pulling sponsorship deals from Limbaugh's radio show, fans refused to tune in and a couple of stations dropped its broadcast. These included Carbonite, Proflowers, Tax Resolution . Services, Legal Zoom, Citrix Success, All State, Heart and Body . Extract, AutoZone, Quicken Loans, Sleep Train, Sleep Number, Oreck and AOL have all stopped advertising with the show. KPUA in Hilo, Hawaii, and WBEC in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, were no longer airing the show. Listeners of smaller, local radio stations that broadcast the syndicated show were being called on to pressure advertisers to cut all ties. Twitter users were also spreading the message using the hashtags #BoycottRush, #StopRush and #BoycottHate. Several Facebook pages sprung up and attracted thousands of fans to support the action. Limbaugh made a rare public apology on Saturday in the wake of the uproar caused by his comments. But Fluke, who became Limbaugh's target after she testified about birth control before a Congressional panel, questioned the sincerity of the apology, adding that she did not want to hear from Limbaugh personally. 'The statements he’s made about me over the air are personal enough, so I’d rather not have a personal phone call with him,' Ms Fluke said on ABC’s The View. Limbaugh admitted that his 'choice of words was not the best' and couldn’t resist taking a swipe at his opponents. 'I . acted too much like the leftists who despise me. I descended to their . level, using names and exaggerations,' he said. 'It’s what we’ve come to . expect from them, but it’s way beneath me.' Anger: Many advertisers reacted to Limbaugh's controversial 'slut' comments by suspending adverts on the programme . Decision: Citrix Systems has also decided to boycott the show . The comments amplified an election-year clash over Obama’s plan to require health insurers to cover contraception. Republican presidential candidates have cast the plan as an attack on religion as they court socially conservative voters. But they have distanced themselves from Limbaugh’s incendiary rhetoric as polls show that nearly two-thirds of voters support Obama’s plan. Limbaugh apologised again on Monday but continued to criticize Ms Fluke’s efforts to force the Catholic university to include contraception in its health insurance coverage. 'If birth control insurance is important to you as an enrolling student … you might want to attend or work at a school that isn’t run by Catholics,' he said. Limbaugh’s show is broadcast for three hours each weekday. Talkers Magazine, a broadcast industry trade publication, estimated that Limbaugh reaches at least 15million people a week, the most of any U.S. radio talk show. His comments are the latest wrinkle in a . battle over birth control and religious freedom that have emerged as a . surprise hot-button issue in the 2012 presidential contest. Boycott: Sleep Number Sara has also decided to suspend all advertising on the show . Religious organizations, the Catholic Church and social conservatives have protested Obama’s policy, which originally required all employers that provide health insurance to cover contraceptives, as an infringement on religious liberty. Obama subsequently tweaked the policy so that religiously affiliated employers like hospitals, universities and charities would not be required to cover the cost. That did not satisfy Catholic bishops, who reject artificial contraceptives. Republicans in Congress have unsuccessfully tried to repeal the new birth control rule, an effort that Democrats, in turn, have cast as a Republican 'war on women'. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said it has raised $1.6million since Fluke testified on Capitol Hill two weeks ago, tying the flurry of donations to outrage over the Republicans’ action. 'It’s a dramatic loser for the Republicans, because the vast majority of American women use birth control at some point in their lives,' said Southern Methodist University political science professor Cal Jillson.","Right-wing host labelled student Sandra Fluke a 'prostitute' on the air .

"Celebrity lawyer Gloria Allred is calling for Rush Limbaugh to be prosecuted on a defamation . charge, saying an obscure Florida law can be used to punish him for . calling a college student a 'slut' and a 'prostitute' on the air. The 70-year-old sent a letter to the Palm Beach . County Attorney's Office on Thursday saying prosecutors should consider a . charge under an 1883 law making it a misdemeanor to question a woman's . chastity. 'He has personally targeted her and . vilified her, and he should have to bear the consequences of his . extremely outrageous, tasteless and damaging conduct,' Allred said in a . phone interview on Friday. Controversial: Talk show host Rush Limbaugh apologised to a Georgetown University law student he branded a 'slut' and 'prostitute' after several advertisers left his program . Limbaugh had no . immediate comment on the letter and did not address it in his radio show on . Friday. Rachel Nelson, a spokeswoman for Clear Channel's Premiere Radio . Networks Inc., said the network had nothing further to add. Denise . Nieman, the county attorney, said she forwarded the letter to the state . attorney's office, which handles criminal matters. The state attorney's . office had no immediate comment. Allred . focused her efforts on Palm Beach because Limbaugh both lives and . broadcasts his show from the county. She cited a state law that says, 'Whoever speaks of and concerning any woman, married or unmarried, . falsely and maliciously imputing to her a want of chastity, shall be . guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree.' Allred . has a long history of taking on high-profile cases, most recently . representing a woman who claimed to have been sexually harassed by . former presidential candidate Herman Cain, and a woman who received lewd . messages from former Rep. Anthony Weiner. Dissatisfied: Gloria Allred, left, calls Limbaugh's apology to Sandra Fluke, right, 'meaningless' Whether . prosecutors will take the request seriously and whether such a case . could pose First Amendment issues remained to be seen. But the law . should be used because it is still on the books, Allred said. 'I'm . sure he has an army of highly paid attorneys in his entourage to advise . him about how he should defend himself,' she said. 'I'm concerned about . the impact that he has had and that he wished to have had on women who . choose to speak out and exercise their free speech.' The . tumult began last week when Limbaugh discounted the appearance of a . Georgetown law student, Sandra Fluke, on Capitol Hill. Fluke testified . to congressional Democrats in support of their national health care . policy that would compel her Catholic college's health plan to cover her . birth control, a comment Limbaugh seized on. He . said last Wednesday: 'What does it say about the college coed ... who . goes before a congressional committee and essentially says that she must . be paid to have sex? It makes her a slut, right? It makes her a . prostitute. She wants to be paid to have sex.' After . an outcry - and the decision by numerous businesses to pull their ads . from his show - he apologised, saying: 'I should not have used the . language I did, and it was wrong.' Allred called his apology 'meaningless'.",Obscure Florida law can be used to punish him for calling college student a 'slut' and a 'prostitute' on air .

"A British man and his beauty queen ex-wife have been murdered in front of their five-year-old daughter in a horrific robbery in Venezuela. Thomas Berry, 39, from London and Miss Venezuela 2004, Monica Spear Mootz, 29, were gunned down by thieves after their car broke down on the Puerto-Cabello to Valencia highway at about 10pm on Monday.

Heartbreaking: Monica Spear Mootz, 29, and Thomas Berry, 39, had an amicable split a year earlier but took vacations together with their daughter- including the one they were on when they were killed . Horrific: Robbers shot through the car windscreen when the terrified family locked themselves in . Nightmare: A friend of Berry said he had spoken to him on Sunday and was told they were having a great time . Armed men came up the car as the couple waited . for a repair truck, and the terrified couple locked themselves in their . Toyota Corolla. But the robbers opened fire through the windows. The bodies of Mr Berry and Ms Spear, who had American citizenship, were found in the car with their daughter, who had been shot in the leg. The five-year-old, believed to be called Maya, was taken to hospital where family and friends are helping to care for her. According to Telemundo, the car was already on the back of a tow truck at the time of the attack. Two tow truck drivers who had arrived to help the couple are said to be under 'intense interrogation' by police. All the tires on the couple's car had been punctured after it hit 'a sharp object that had been placed on the highway', director of investigative police, Jose Gregorio Sierralta, said. At least six shots are believed to have been fired, hitting Mr Berry in the chest, his ex-wife in several places and their daughter in the leg. The attack appeared to follow a pattern of recent robberies, where cars are disabled by obstacles left in roads, or drain covers removed. A photo believed to be the couple's car was pictured behind police tape by Gilbert Angustia on Twitter. Monica Spear posted a video on Instagram of her horse riding just hours before she died . New horizons: Monica Spear posted this photo of she and her daughter Maya just days before the fatal attack that left her and her ex-husband dead .

Ms Spear was a famous TV actress following her pageant victory and appeared in a number of telenovelas [South American soap operas], with her roll in 'Forbidden Passions' the most notable. Police believe the couple may have been targeted by bandits who put obstacles in the road to force victims to stop. The ploy is commonly used on the country's highways after dark. Venezuela is one the most violent places in Latin America and armed robberies, carjackings and kidnappings are rife. The annual murder rate in Caracas alone is an average of 80 murders per 100,000 people, the third highest in the world. Most . murders occur in the slums where police presence is minimal. Eastern . Caracas is home to South America’s largest slum, named Petare with more . than two million residents, where the police to public ratio is 1 . officer to every 3,000 people. There . were an estimated 24,000 murders in 2013, one of the world’s highest . homicide rates. It has tripled in the previous decade. Gun ownership is also high, with an estimated 15 million unlicensed weapons in circulation.

Her ex-husband, who described himself as an . independent travel consultant in an online profile, lived in the capital . Caracas, reports El Universal. He moved to Florida for a short time after he was shot 15 years ago in a robbery that killed his friend. 'He had already been shot once by robbers trying to steal his car,' close friend Luis Dominguez told The Telegraph. 'His friend died in the incident and although doctors saved his life, they couldn't extract the bullet and he still had it in his stomach.' ['Mr Berry] moved to the States to get . away from things here for a while but missed Venezuela and came back,' Mr Dominguez added. It . is understood Mr Berry and his wife had separated last year, but were . still close friends and holidayed together for the sake of their . daughter.

His parents are at the hospital with the couple's daughter. It is not known if his sister, Katie, who lives in Scotland, will fly out to be with the family. Ms Spear's parents were flown from Florida to Venezuela by private jet, provided by Venezuela's president, so they could be with their granddaughter. 'It is the deepest pain, the deepest pain. It is unbelievable,' her father, Rafael, told the Orlando Sentinel. 'She was very charismatic, a very good daughter, a very good mother, and she loved Venezuela.' He recalled how his daughter had come to him for advice when she wanted to change from her chemical engineering course to study acting instead. 'I told her she had to decide what she wanted to do to be happy for the rest of her life,' he said. 'When my children were young, I wouldn't let them watch telenovelas, and then she began acting in soap operas, and I began watching all of hers.' Mr Dominguez, who ran an adventure tour company with the actress's ex-husband, told NBC he last spoke to Mr Berry on Sunday. 'They were having the greatest time. He said, I'll see you soon,' Mr Dominguez said. A friend of the family, Carlos Drakkar, 38, a Colombian graphic designer who lives in Caracas, said: 'This is a very difficult moment for all of us to deal with.

"Czech student Alexandra Drbohlavova, 22 - known as Sasa to her friends - died after she was stabbed up to 15 times in her head, neck, and chest in her tent at an eco-farm in a remote rainforest area of Costa Rica. Alfred Saunders, 20, the son of two high-flying academics has been arrested for the sexually motivated murder at the paradise hideaway in Central America. Lenka Janalova, 22, a fellow student from Charles University in Prague said: 'I can’t believe this has happened. It is an absolute shock to all of us who knew her. This image of murdered student Alexandra Drbohlavova (circled) with friends emerged today. It was taken in Domino Park, Miami, five days before she flew to Costa Rica . Suspect Alfred Saunders with a towel over his head is led away by Costa Rican police officers . Alexandra - a keen volleyball player - had gone on to study at Florida's Miami University in the U.S. 'Sasa was such a kind, sweet person. She was always smiling and willing to help others. 'I can only imagine the horror she must have felt when she found this man inside her tent. 'She was always so calm and peaceful - the horror of this is beyond words.' Sasa - a keen volleyball player - had gone on to study at Florida's Miami University in the U.S. She had also been invited to spend Christmas and the New Year with friends at the university's United Methodist ministry in Miami but turned them down to travel to Costa Rica where she had volunteered to work on the remote organic farm. International volunteers are offered free food and lodging in return for working to help establish an ecologically friendly development in the rainforest. The farm, run by British ecology graduate Nic Donati and his American wife Erin, has been closed since the murder. Pictures emerged of a smiling Sasa today on a visit with her university friends to Miami's Domino Park in Little Havana, taken just five days before she flew off to Central America. As a result of Costa Rica’s reputation for relative safety in Central America, it has proved popular with British ‘gap-year’ youngsters seeking adventure. Saunders, who lives in a £1million mews house in exclusive Notting Hill, West London, with his mother Dr Catia Galatariotou, an expert on the sexual development of children, appears to have been travelling the world for some time. Police chief Mr Morales said Saunders arrived at the farm only hours before the killing. He added: ‘The mystery is what he was doing at the farm. He turned up the day before the incident with no luggage and virtually just the clothes he was wearing. We believe he came from Nicaragua. ‘The farm manager says he doesn’t know him and he hadn’t arranged to do any volunteer work, and it appears he and his wife have taken pity on him and allowed him to borrow a tent and stay.’ The murder took place late last Wednesday night, when Mr Donati is understood to have heard screams coming from Miss Drbohlavova’s tent. Tourist destination: Costa Rica has many national parks with volcanoes and rainforests. As a result of the country's reputation for relative safety in Central America, it has proved popular with British 'gap-year' youngsters seeking adventure. Mr Morales – who claimed Saunders had a history of schizophrenia – said: ‘The suspect was sleeping in a tent near to the murder victim’s. The manager of the farm heard screaming and shouting and as he approached the woman’s tent, saw the suspect coming out with a torch in his hand. He shone his torch at him and saw blood on his clothes and face. 'He managed to apprehend him and tie him up with the help of his wife. The victim was already near death when he looked inside her tent. There’s no phone at the farm so he brought the suspect to us and asked for help for the woman. ‘She was already dead by the time help arrived. The suspect told us he can’t remember anything about what happened.’ The policeman added: ‘The suspect had a lot of marks on him which appear to indicate he was involved in a struggle.’ Saunders was taken to the regional capital of Aguas Claras de Upala, 50 miles from the farm. He was then remanded in custody following a court hearing in the middle of the night. Mr Morales said a ‘green Interpol notice’ issued as an international warning of a potential offender, had been sent out about Saunders. ‘It’s for offences relating to the use of firearms and explosives and also for a sex attack,’ he said. British police and Interpol were unable to confirm the claim. But a Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘We can confirm a British national has been arrested in Costa Rica. We are providing consular assistance.’ Saunders’ father Max Saunders, 54, is a professor of English at King’s College London, and lives in fashionable Hampstead, North London. His mother Dr Galatariotou, 56, who is separated from Mr Saunders, has lectured on psychoanalysis at University College London. Miss Drbohlavova was a philosophy student from Prague. She had spent two terms at university in Miami, before travelling to Costa Rica. Friends said she spent every summer carrying out voluntary work, usually with children.

"British Interpol officials had warned that a professor’s son arrested over a frenzied murder in Costa Rica was a dangerous individual linked to a string of sex crimes and likely to commit acts of barbarism. Alfred Saunders – the son of wealthy London academics – was captured last Wednesday as he emerged covered in blood from a tent in which Alexandra Drbohlavova had been stabbed to death.

Victim: Alexandra Drbohlavova died following 15 stab wounds . The 20-year-old is in a high-security jail awaiting investigation for the gruesome murder at an idyllic rainforest ‘eco farm’ owned by a Briton. A senior Costa Rican police official last night told the Mail that a ‘green Interpol alert’ had been sent out from Britain in November saying Saunders was at large in Central America. It linked him to sex crimes, possession of explosives and a fatal assault. The alert said he was liable to commit offences against minors. Marisel Rodriguez, of Costa Rica’s judicial police force, said officials picked up on Saunders’s alleged past when he crossed the border from Nicaragua the day after Boxing Day. Inexplicably, he was still allowed to enter the country. The next day he turned up without warning, and with almost no possessions, at the farm owned by Nic Donati. Mr Donati took pity on him and gave . him a tent for the night – yet hours later reportedly had to overpower . him after hearing the screams of Czech student Miss Drbohlavova. Arrested: Suspect Alfred Saunders is led away by Costa Rica police . The 22-year-old, who had been a . volunteer at the farm for just over a fortnight, was stabbed 15 times in . the face, neck and chest. Miss Rodriguez said: ‘The man being held over the murder of the Czech woman is the subject of a green Interpol notice. ‘It’s a warning mechanism Interpol . uses and makes available to other countries’ law enforcement agencies . and border control organisations. ‘In Mr Saunders’s case it was for sex . crimes, assault resulting in death, torture or acts of barbarism, and . the possession of firearms, ammunition or explosives. ‘The notice described him as a violent individual who as well as being a suicide risk, was liable to commit sexual crimes against minors and could be armed. ‘It also described him as suffering from mental illness.’ This image of murdered student Alexandra Drbohlavova (circled) with friends emerged today.

Alexandra - a keen volleyball player - had gone on to study at Florida's Miami University in the U.S. She said Costa Rican Interpol had recommended he be refused entry to the country but immigration officials took a different view. ‘Our understanding is that Mr Saunders has a police record and may have been tried but not necessarily convicted on all if any of the crimes,’ she added. ‘We haven’t been given any detailed information on where these other offences are said to have taken place but my understanding is that it was in Britain.’ Saunders is the son of Max Saunders, professor of English at Kings College London and of his former wife, Catia Galatariotou, a psychoanalyst. He lived with his mother at her £1million mews house in Notting Hill. The prison holding Saunders was in lockdown yesterday following a gang fight which left two dead and ten other injured. Gun-toting wardens patrolled barbed wire-swathed watch towers to prevent further violence. Last night, friends in Miss Drbohlavova’s native Prague talked of their shock at her death – and of her selfless life. The philosophy graduate, Christian and volleyball player had been undertaking further studies at Miami University and had travelled to Costa . Rica to further her research during her Christmas break. Lenka Janalova, a university friend from Prague, said: ‘I can’t believe this has happened. It is an absolute shock to all of us who knew her. ‘Sasa (her nickname) was such a kind, sweet person.

He said: ‘She was a very good friend and very dedicated to helping people. She was always open and friendly, and never said anything bad about anyone. ‘She saw the best in people and was one of our most popular leaders.’ He said the Drbohlavova family had previously lived in the U.S. and Miss Drbohlavova had been looking forward to returning to study there.

"This is the moment an a leopard and a hyena had a power lunch of a very different kind. The two hungry beasts engaged in an epic tug of war over a zebra carcass after the big cat killed it, but found its prey too heavy to drag back to his tree. A small pack of crafty hyenas smelt the carcass, and after baring its teeth and growling at the leopard, one decided to cheekily sneak a few bites. Tug of war: The leopard grips the zebra carcass in its jaws, as the sneaky hyena creeps in to take a nibble and steal his catch . Mine all mine: The leopard kills the zebra and grips it in its mouth, while keeping an eye on the hyena which is closing in . Don't even try: The leopard straddles the zebra carcass and turns its head to make sure its prized kill isn't at risk of been stolen . Biting down: The leopard takes a mouthful of the zebra, whose ears are already torn to pieces . After a violent half hour tussle, the leopard was victorious and dragged his kill away so he could finally feast in peace. The culinary tug-of-war was captured at the Masaï Mara Game Reserve, Kenya, by photographers Laurent Renaud and Dominique Haution. Mr Renaud, a 55-year-old teacher from France, said 'It was exceptional' to see the food fight, which is a rare sight. He said: 'The leopard had killed a young zebra but it was impossible to carry it up into his tree. Dinner for one: The leopard at the Masaï Mara Game Reserve in Kenya bears its teeth and tries to scare the hyena off . I'm hungry too: The hyena howls at the leopard and signals that its not going to let the big car eat alone . Creeping in: The hyena decides it can't wait any longer and charges in to challenge the leopard for the zebra carcass . Aerial maneuvers: The leopard tries to move the carcass at speed while keeping a close eye on the darting hyena . Eye to eye: The leopard and the hyena square off over the zebra carcass which they both grip in their jaws and refuse to let go . 'Several hyenas were attracted to the smell and at first the leopard gave up and walked away. 'He then came back and wanted to carry the kill away but the hyenas weren't going to give up without a fight.' Mr Renaud said after 30 minutes of 'vicious pulling and gnashing of teeth' the leopard was victorious and strode away.","A leopard at the Masaï Mara Game Reserve in Kenya catches and kills a zebra .

"'Could have died': Beau Marshall's parents are still waiting for a doctor to call them back more than a week after calling the 111 NHS helpline . A girl of ten could have died if her parents had relied on the controversial new NHS 111 helpline, they said last night. Beau Marshall was ill with stomach cramps last Saturday when her worried mother Candice phoned the service that is being piloted in her area. She spoke first to a call-centre worker, then to someone else with some medical training – who assured her a doctor would phone back within two hours to assess the little girl and possibly to arrange a home visit. But more than a week on, the doctor has still not called and if Mrs Marshall had followed NHS advice her daughter could have died. For when Beau's condition worsened, her parents drove to hospital themselves. Within two hours, the youngster was diagnosed with potentially fatal appendicitis and her 'very inflamed' appendix was removed. Last night Beau's parents added their voices to the growing concern over the introduction of the 111 service. Doctors have warned lives could be at risk, saying some of the £16,000-a-year call-centre workers who are manning the phone lines are only partially trained. As well as claims of potentially fatal conditions being missed, there have already been reports of ambulances being sent to people with hiccups. The call-centre staff simply work through computer checklists to ascertain the seriousness of each call. The idea is the new service combines the long-running NHS Direct helpline with local emergency out-of-hours services. But staff have been recruited for as little as £8 per hour to man the phone lines. Job adverts suggest they require no medical experience but should have telesales experience and typing skills. Controversy: Beau's parents added their voices to the concern over the 111 service (library image) The British Medical Association has called for the introduction of the service across most of England to be delayed until problems are resolved. Those taking the calls do not need to be . medically trained at all, and instead work through computer check lists . as callers tell them their symptoms. They may then be referred to speak . on the phone with nurses or doctors if necessary. Already in operation in 22 NHS regions, NHS 111 is due to 'go live' across the North of the Tyne and Tees area tomorrow and in a further 13 areas over the coming month. Beau's father Paul Marshall, who lives with his wife, three daughters and young son in Bournemouth, said: 'When my daughter had stomach pains last Saturday, my wife dialled 111 and they told us a doctor would phone back within two hours. 'They still haven't phoned back yet. We took her to accident and emergency in the end, and within two-and-a-half-hours of Beau being seen by the triage nurse, she was being operated on. 'The 111 service was awful - they didn't know who was doing what. If we had solely gone on what they said, potentially she could have died.' Mrs Marshall, a housewife, said: 'When I . dialled 111 they asked me lots of questions. Because she had banged her . head with a boy in her class, they were more interested her a . non-existent head injury than the pain in her abdomen. Concerns: Doctors have warned lives could be at risk because some staff are only partially-trained . 'She'd been sick as well, and that can . be another sign of a head injury - but of course it is also a sign of . appendicitis. The first guy I spoke to said he was going to be a . clinician to phone back, and about ten minutes later someone did. 'She tried to get us an out-of-hours . appointment at 9.30pm last Saturday, but couldn't get us one until the . next day, so said “I'm going to get an out of hours doctor to phone you, . and if he thinks it necessary he'll come out and assess her”. That was . eight days ago. A doctor still hasn't called back.' Beau was kept in hospital until Monday, and has made a full recovery. A spokesman for NHS England, the body managing the NHS 111 service's introduction, said: 'This is a very important service for the public and we will make sure everything is in place to make a safe, high quality service that patients and the public can trust. 'Many sites are already up and running, but in areas where NHS 111 is not yet available we will make a thorough assessment of readiness before new sites are introduced. 'The public can be assured the areas that already have NHS 111 will continue this service. In those areas where NHS 111 is not yet in place they can ring NHS Direct on 0845 46 47. All GP surgeries also have messages advising what to do.'","Beau Marshall's parents were assured a doctor would call back within hours .

"A Royal Marine who took his own life on his return from Afghanistan was one of 90 per cent of troops who did not have a welfare interview within the 12-week guideline, an inquest was told today. Dylan Kemp, a 28-year-old member of 42 Commando Royal Marines, wrote in a suicide note that he had 'too much anger'. He was found dead in his flat in Croydon, south London in September 2009, two days after being charged with assaulting his girlfriend. Dylan Kemp, a 28-year-old member of 42 Commando Royal Marines, wrote in a suicide note that he had 'too much anger' Since returning home he was also arrested over an alleged road-rage attack. Patrick Roche, representing Mne Kemp's mother, Mary Kemp, told Croydon Coroner's Court that despite leaving Afghanistan in April 2009, he had not gone through a Post-Operational Stress Management interview before his death. Mr Roche asked Warrant Officer Andrew MacFarlane, the discipline warrant officer for 42 Commando, why Mne Kemp had not been interviewed five months after his return. He replied: 'Possibly because no-one knew where he was.' Mne Kemp had joined the Armed Forces Careers Office and was based in London. WO MacFarlane said in his evidence that at the time 90 per cent of marines missed the 12-week mark. 'I'd say it's a guideline,' he said.

'We try to interview - to capture - everyone within that 12-week period. Unfortunately we weren't able to do it.' He agreed with Mr Roche's suggestion that it had been a 'fairly dismal failure'. Kate Bex, representing Mne Kemp's girlfriend, Philippa Roscoe, read out extracts of a note he left before taking his life. He wrote: 'I had too much anger and only want to be out there. 'Royal Marine staff are excellent so do not let this be a pitfall for them that I slipped through the net, and I'm sure many will follow.' The inquest had previously heard evidence from Ms Roscoe and a colleague that Mne Kemp had described to them that he had recovered human remains as part of his tour in Afghanistan. But Warrant Officer Russell Taylor told today's hearing: 'At no point was a member of J Company asked to pick up body parts.'

The inquest had heard evidence that Mne Kemp had described to them that he had recovered human remains as part of his tour in Afghanistan . When questioned about evidence that Mne Kemp had talked of 'having to pick up his mate's body parts', he replied: 'I'm sorry but that is a fabrication.' Acting Lieutenant Colonel Reginald Turner told the hearing he was 'unaware of him being involved in any sort of incident'. He said: 'Picking up body parts was a significant incident. It is something which we would have been all aware.' He added: 'We would appropriately debrief individuals afterwards.' Mne Kemp was deployed to Afghanistan in September 2008 until April 2009, with a two-week break in the UK over Christmas. He was found dead in his home on Nottingham Road, Croydon. He had a ligature bruise on his neck which pathologist Peter Walker had previously described in evidence as 'consistent with death by hanging'.

"For the past 160 days a South Carolina family have lived under self-quarantine, but not out of fears over the Ebola crisis - it's to protect their daughter who suffers from a rare syndrome. Glenn O'Neill and his wife Cara have opted to stay away from other people to protect Mr O'Neill's daughter Eliza, four, who has the rare metabolism disorder, Sanfilippo syndrome. Children with the disease typically develop deficiencies in muscle growth, speech and brain functions by the time they are five, and later become confined to a wheelchair as it spreads. Glenn and Cara O'Neill with their children, Eliza, four, and Beckham, seven, have been in self-quarantine for 160 days in order to protect Eliza who has a rear metabolic condition from getting any worse . In May Eliza and her brother, Beckham, 7, were pulled out of school and Ms O'Neil left her job as a pediatrician for special needs children. Mr Neill now works from home as a purchasing consultant. Mr O'Neill told the New York Daily News: 'People say we're being overprotective, but when it comes to protecting your daughter, how can you use that word?' The O'Neills say their situation is less intense than a government-issued quarantine. They leave their house a week, but only to places they know will be empty, like a deserted beach. States including New York, New Jersey and Illinois established policies mandating that workers who treated Ebola patients in West Africa must put themselves on 21-day quarantines. Medical experts have said the regulations are unnecessary and many people placed under the mandates have resisted them. Eliza has Sanfilippo syndrome; children with the disease typically develop deficiencies in muscle growth, speech and brain functions by the time they are five, and later become confined to a wheelchair as it spreads . Doctors Without Borders nurse Kaci Hickox was placed in a tent outside a New Jersey hospital with no shower, no TV and only a portable toilet after returning from Sierra Leone on Friday, The New York Post reported. She remained under supervision, despite testing negative for the disease, until Monday. She was then allowed to return to her home in Maine where she served her 21-day quarantine. The only time Mr O'Neill has gone somewhere where there were other people, was a bank, to sign a form for the family's Saving Eliza Foundation -  and it almost went horribly wrong. The 42-year-old informed the bank ahead of time he that would walk in, sign the papers and leave without touching anything. But after pulling on a protective mask and gloves while in the car park, a fellow motorist quickly retreated, 'he thought I was going to rob the place'. Mr O'Neil then called the bank and reminded them of his circumstances before entering. Despite testing negative for Ebola, Doctors Without Borders nurse Kaci Hickox, who had just returned from Sierra Leone, was placed in a tent outside a New Jersey hospital and kept there for several days; she was later allowed to return home to serve a 21-day quarantine . The family leaves the house once a week, but only to spots where they know other people won't be . Eliza, who is soon to turn five, is at a critical stage. A simple cold or illness could accelerate her deterioration, and keeping her away from people has paid off. Mr O'Neill said she has not gotten sick and is doing as well as can be expected. The family is raising money to fund a clinical trial that will hopefully cure the disease. They will remain under quarantine under the procedure is available, which the hope is early next year.

"Police searching for missing toddler William Tyrell have questioned motorists who may have been driving past the house where he disappeared more than a week ago, in an increasingly desperate hunt for clues. Officers stopped vehicles on near the house on Benaroon Drive at Kendall at about 10.30am - the time and place William was last seen. Local police asked drivers if they had noticed any 'unusual cars' one week ago, or if they had any information that might relate to his disappearance. Scroll down for video . Police have stopped passers-by as they investigate the disappearance of missing toddler William Tyrell last seen at his grandmother's home in Kendall . It comes as police investigate the possibility that the missing toddler  was picked up by someone in a car when he disappeared last Friday. He was last seen playing with his sister in his grandmother's garden on Benaroon Drive in Kendall, on the New South Wales mid-north coast, when he went missing in a five minute window while his mother and grandmother were inside the house. Superintendent Paul Fehon said William's family were struggling with the fact that there were still no leads in relation to his whereabouts. 'Of course, being a week from when young William went missing, it's emotionally distressing for them,' he said. 'They are doing it very tough.' Police said William's family are doing it very tough in light of the fact there has been no trace of him . 'It's emotionally distressing for them': Police say the search for William has taken a huge toll on his family . The week-long search has  uncovered no trace of the toddler, who was last seen in the garden of his grandmother's property on Beneroon Drive . Police hope questioning  motorists will help locate any suspicious vehicles seen in the Kendall area . The massive search shifted from bushland near his grandmother's home to a state forest nearby on Thursday . Police are trying to trace  the movements of motor vehicles which were seen in the area last Friday . About 70 volunteers, State Emergency Service crews and police will continue searching roadsides in the nearby Middle Brother State Forest for evidence as they focus on the possibility William was picked up by a car. More than 200 volunteers and residents have scoured kilometres of bush surrounding the property in the seven days since he disappeared. A number of tips, including reports that a 'well-dressed, well-spoken' man stopped at a local shop on Friday morning to ask directions to Batar Creek Road, which leads to Benaroon Drive where William was last seen, have uncovered nothing. Forensic tests performed on a patch of blood found near a creek just over 2km from William's grandmother's house were also negative. Test results showed it was not human blood. Bush trackers have found clues such as a knife sheath and a set of small footprints, but tip-offs from bush searches, investigations of CCTV and interviews with neighbours and local businesses have not uncovered a solid lead. But despite the lengthy search efforts Supt Fehon said police were aiming to broaden their investigation. 'We are following every possible avenue of inquiry that is being provided to us, be it CCTV, be it information regarding persons that may have been in the area, and we're asking the public if they know of anything to provide that information to Crime Stoppers,' he said.

"Fulham fought back from two goals down against ten man Blackpool to extend their unbeaten run in the Championship to five games. But boos accompanied the final whistle at Craven Cottage. It did not feel like a success for the home side,who dominated completely after Blackpool’s Tony McMahon was sent off in the first half but failed to find a winner. Manager Kit Symons, previously caretaker manager but enjoying his first game at Craven Cottage since being appointed on a permanent basis, conceded it was an opportunity missed. Bryan Ruiz scores straight from a corner to earn Fulham a point late on against Blackpool . Blackpool raced into a 2-0 lead with Jacob Murphy (centre) scoring the Seasiders' second . Fulham: Bettinelli 6, Zverotic 6, Bodurov 6, Burn 6, Amorebieta 5 (Stafylidis 44, 6), Parker 7.5, Christensen 5, Williams 5.5 (Roberts 68, 6), Ruiz 6, Rodallega 5.5, Dembele 5.5 (Woodrow 76).

Ref: Robert Madley (West Yorkshire) 5 . ‘It’s two points dropped for me,’ he said, ‘We threw the proverbial kitchen sink at them.’ Joe Lewis was the hero of the night for the visitors. The keeper made several vital saves to give his side their first point in five games and just their seventh of the season. Blackpool manager Lee Clark, who faces a tough job to rescue the seasiders’ season after taking over this week hailed his side’s ‘heroic’ second half display. ‘The second half my lads were heroic,’ he said, ‘I don’t think many better teams in this league have more talent than fulham and we did amazingly well. Joe made some brilliant saves.’ But for a moment of madness from captain McMahon - who saw red for lashing out at Hugo Rodallega off the ball - Blackpool might have taken all three points. ‘I’ll be having a conversation with him,’ said Clark, ‘I’ve admired from afar and like him even more since I’ve got to work with him but even if hasn’t made contact it’s not good. I haven’t spoken to him yet that’s how he knows I’m annoyed.’ Most of the visiting fans had journeyed several hours to support their side in the bracing cold.

McMahon leaves the pitch after being sent off and would watch his side throw away a two-goal lead . Scott Parker of Fulham celebrates scoring a goal with team-mates after reducing Fulham's deficit . But within 90 seconds they were warmed by the sight of Ishmael Miller putting the seasiders ahead. Donervon Daniels played a ball into the box which Miller controlled with his chest before coolly poking past Marcus Bettinelli into the bottom corner with his left foot. The 6ft3in Miller, built like a heavyweight boxer, celebrated his goal with a solo samba dance. He showed off his quick feet again in the 26th minute, hurtling into the box, sending Dan Burn the wrong and evading another two Fulham defenders then pulling the ball back to leave Jacob Murphy to tap in from five yards out. The 19 year old winger on loan from Norwich, impressed on his Blackpool debut. Murphy, an England under-20 international whose twin brother Josh remains at Norwich, is on a three month deal which the seasiders might be keen to extend. Just minutes short of the interval Captain McMahon lost his head and lashed out at Hugo Rodallega off the ball and was shown red by referee Robert Madley, acting on information from his linesman. Blackpool manager Lee Clark asked for an explanation from the officials as they headed down the tunnel at half time. Scott Parker pulled one back in first half stoppage time from a Moussa Dembele corner. A scuffed clearance by Daniels fell kindly to him and the 34-year-old former England midfielder beat keeper Lewis with a low drive into the near corner. The cottagers dominated for most of the second half as they attempted to take advantage of their extra man against a tiring Blackpool. Joe Lewis kept the home side out with a few blockbuster saves, notably of a powerful George Williams effort from 20 yards and to deny Nikolay Bodurov. Eventually, Lewis could keep them out no longer. He was helpless as he punched the ball into his own net from a Bryan Ruiz corner in the 73rd minute, although he appeared to have been pushed. ‘That was a definite foul for me,’ said Clark.","Blackpool were on course for their second win of the season .

"This is the historic speech the free world did not want to hear - and, thankfully, didn't. Hastily scribbled on piece of paper, Allied supremo General Dwight D. Eisenhower jotted down what he planned to say had D-Day, which was 70 years ago tomorrow, been a disaster. The little-known document, known as 'In Case of Failure', was quickly drafted by the commander of Operation Overlord in the event of the landings ending in bloody failure. The 66-word script reveals the U.S. general and Britain's Prime Minister Winston Churchill would have withdrawn the thousands of troops from the Normandy beaches rather than let them fight to the death. This is the chilling speech Allied supremo General Dwight Eisenhower planned to make had D-Day turned into Doomsday, scribbled down on a note . It also shows Eisenhower, who went on to become president in 1953, would have accepted the full blame for the unimaginable defeat at the hands of the Nazis. In the event, the Normandy landings were a success and ultimately led to the beginning of the end of the Second World War. Eisenhower . gave the note to his adjutant officer five weeks after D-Day and it is . has been held by the Eisenhower Presidential Library for the last 30 . years. A copy of it has now . been published by the British military online archive Forces War Records . to mark the 70th anniversary of D-Day. Tom . Bennington, of Forces War Records, said: 'It is a . very simple document but one that is very chilling given what was at . stake. 'While Operation . Overlord went down in history as a success and gave the Allies a . foothold in Europe, this piece of paper almost shows how easily it could . have gone the other way. Eisenhower , who later became President, and then British Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill would have withdrawn the thousands of troops from the Normandy beaches rather than let them fight to the death . 'The . note certainly paints a picture of Eisenhower, while confident of . success on D-Day, preparing for the worst case scenario as 150,000 men . were preparing to land on the beaches. 'Had . he had to use these notes on D-Day it would have meant that there would . have been thousands of Allied casualties lying on the beaches of . Normandy. 'It would have . meant defeat for the Allies in the west and left Germany to focus all . their efforts on the Russians on the Eastern Front, giving the Second . World War a very different outcome. Dwight D. Eisenhower, who became President in 1953, would have carried the can if D-Day in 1944 had been a failure . 'It also would have ended Eisenhower's career as Supreme Allied Commander and probably the end Winston Churchill's government.' Eisenhower was going to read the message out either to reporters or over the radio had D-Day ended in defeat. The text, scribbled on a scrap of paper measuring 6ins by 4ins, reads: 'Our landings in the Cherbourg-Haver area have failed to gain a satisfactory foothold and I have withdrawn the troops. 'My decision to attack at this time and place was based upon the best information available. 'The troops, the air, and the navy did all that bravery and devotion to duty could do. If any blame or fault attaches to the attempt, it is mine alone.' The message is dated July 5, 1944 - it is thought that he wrote the wrong month in error due to exhaustion. It is said that before D-Day the Allied high command considered a successful landing would cost 10,000 dead. In the event, the number of deaths were about 5,000. The majority of those were on Omaha Beach which was in the American sector. Tim Rives, the deputy director of the Eisenhower Presidential Library in Kansas, US, said: 'To think that Eisenhower was willing to take the full blame should D-Day fail is quite telling of his character. 'It is an example of a leading taking responsibility. 'Winston Churchill's chief concern on D-Day was a bloodbath on the beaches and Eisenhower clearly felt the same as the plan was to withdraw rather than fight to the end. 'Eisenhower's adjutant officer was Captain Harry Butcher. About a month after D-Day Eisenhower pulled this note out of his wallet and showed it to Butcher who kept it. 'It was donated to the library in the 1980s by his family.'

"Just as Halloween wouldn't be complete without pumpkin carving or ghoulish decorations, it wouldn't be the same without Jimmy Kimmel's now traditional prank on kids. The late-night talk show host tricked unsuspecting youngsters across the country for the fourth year in a row by encouraging their parents to tell them they had eaten all their Halloween candy. The results, which were caught on camera and shared a four-minute video, show kids kicking and screaming - and even swearing - at their chuckling parents. 'You've ruined my life!' one yells, while another howls: 'I'm not talking to you for the rest of my life!' Scroll down for video . Pained: Two boys can do nothing but scream and cry when their parents claim they've eaten all their snacks - unaware that they are only joking. The video is part of Jimmy Kimmel's annual prank on kids . Enraged: One little girl howls and then begins kicking her legs after learning there's no candy left . Anger: Two brothers break down in sobs - and continue to be mad even when their mother says it's a joke . One girl throws a monstrous fit - pushing over chairs, throwing plates and screaming - while another little boy refuses to believe his mother and turfs through kitchen drawers in search of his snacks. 'Get out,' he scowls at her. Others are simply in disbelief at how their parents could eat so much, with one asking: 'All of it? Every single bite? You must have a bellyache.' But some of the children are understanding of their parents' sweet teeth, and gently reassure them that it's OK. In a show of kindness, one little boy lifts his hand to his mother as he insists 'it's fine, it's fine' - before giving her a hug. Make it stop! One youngster can only shake his head and moan as his dad helps himself to his candy . Warning: A boy sobs, left, while another checks all the kitchen drawers and then tells his mom: 'Get out' Fit: One girl  throws a chair to the ground and then picks up a plate from a table and throws it on the floor . Oops: One girl doesn't miss a beat after her dad says her candy is gone - and bombards him with expletives . Jimmy Kimmel first encouraged parents to trick their kids with the prank in 2011 and has been doing the same every year since. 'We did it again this year and got more videos than ever before,' the show explained on its YouTube page. 'We sifted through more than a thousand and whittled it down to our favorites.' At the end of the clip, Kimmel explained that if parents and their kids really did get too much candy, they could send it to the troops via Operation Gratitude by November 15. 'Thanks to all the parents who participated - and apologies to the kids who participated as well,' he said, laughing. In past years, some people have failed to find the prank funny. Up to his usual tricks: Jimmy Kimmel has pranked kids across the country for the fourth year in a row by encouraging their parents to tell them they had eaten all their Halloween candy . 'Pranking your own children is not harmless fun, but is cruel and potentially damaging,' Mark Barnett, a professor at Kansas State University's department of psychological sciences, said last year. He questioned whether parents were looking out for the best interests of the child. But this year's viewers were tickled by the video. 'This has to be the funniest series on the internet! Its a pity its only once a year! [sic]' one wrote. Another warned: 'One day, those kids will hunt you down Jimmy.'","The late-night talk show host pranked kids for the fourth year in a row .

"A female student has been shot and wounded by a male classmate at a Kentucky high school this afternoon. The teen was shot in the stomach and leg after a boy, age 15 to 16, opened fire after a fight Tuesday afternoon at Fern Creek Traditional High School in Louisville, according to reports.

"Some 54 years after stealing several newspaper racks, a U.S. Navy veteran has sent a letter of apology and a check for $200 to The Ledger of Lakeland, Florida. Bernard Schermerhorn says he's followed the rules for most of his 73 years, but caved to peer pressure as a teenager and went along with a friend's scheme to steal several racks from The Ledger. In a Sept. 30 letter to the newspaper, Schermerhorn says they took a handful of change and then dumped the racks. Some 54 years after stealing several newspaper rack (not pictured) a U.S. Navy veteran has sent a letter of apology and a check for $200 to The Ledger of Lakeland, Florida . 'I wish to now return many times over the cost of six newsstands and the few papers, also the amount of approximately $10 in small change,' he wrote to The Ledger. 'The fact that he talked me into going along with the idea doesn’t in any way lessen my responsibility for what we did collectively,' Schermerhorn added. Schermerhorn, who lives in Le Mesa, California, told the newspaper the check would more than cover the damage and theft of about $10. He said he had no specific moment that made him send the money, but had long wanted to repay the debt. 'I just got to thinking about it, you know, and thought, ‘Hey, send them the money.’' he told the paper. 'It’s just not right to not pay it back. I thought about it many times over the years.' Publisher Kevin Drake says he's sending Schermerhorn a thank-you letter and will donate the money to a children's charity in Lakeland. 'I appreciate his honesty and desire to make things right,' Drake told his reporterss.

"Acquitted: A jury took less than three hours to find Annie Merrilees not guilty of murdering her boyfriend . A former Harrods shop assistant who stabbed her boyfriend has been cleared of murder after telling jurors he was a violent cocaine user who had beaten her for three years. Annie Merrilees, 25, said nightclub bouncer Dean Williamson punched her in the face and banged her head against a gas boiler on the day she stabbed him in the heart. Jurors at the Old Bailey took less than three hours to find her not guilty of murder and manslaughter after she told them she grabbed the knife in self-defence in their shared flat. The mother-of-two sobbed as she told the trial: ‘I never intended to kill him. ‘I was upset about what he did to me but I loved him. He loved me too.’ Ms Merrilees’ relatives wept tears of joy as she was cleared today. Dressed in a black floral top and black trousers, she mouthed ‘thank you’ at the jurors before she was released from the dock. Judge Christopher Moss QC told her: ‘You are free to go’. Police found Mr Williamson, 31, dying on December 17 last year at the flat the couple shared in Chadwell Heath, Essex. The trial heard the couple had both been drinking. When police spoke to Ms Merrilees she initially tried to claim her partner turned the knife on himself. But she later changed her story in a prepared statement through her solicitor, admitting she had stabbed her boyfriend but insisting it was in self-defence. Prosecutor Peter Finnegan conceded Mr Williamson was ‘a man with a history’ and was a heavy drinker and cocaine user. But he told the jury Ms Merrilees was also a drug-taker who was ‘in the habit of getting involved in abusive slanging matches’ with her partner. ‘It was not just a one way street - it was both of them,’ Mr Finnegan added. ‘Some of the neighbours would say she was rather worse than he was'. Ms Merrilees, however, said she had been repeatedly assaulted by Mr Williamson during their three-year relationship. Relationship: Annie Merrilees (left) said her boyfriend Dean Williamson (right) had beaten her for three years . Prosecutors said Ms Merrilees (left) also got involved in 'slanging matches' but she said: ‘I believed I was going to be violently assaulted. I picked up a knife because I was in fear for my safety. I wanted Dean (right) to leave' She said Mr Williamson had grabbed her by the throat, pulled her by the hair, punched her in the face and even attacked her when she was almost eight months pregnant. ‘I didn’t leave because I always hoped that he would get better,' she told the court. 'I loved him'. She said she was attacked on the day of the incident, leaving her with bruises to her head and face. That night he forced his way into the flat, she said, and refused to leave. ‘He became very aggressive,' she said. 'I was extremely concerned for my safety. ‘I believed I was going to be violently assaulted. I picked up a knife because I was in fear for my safety. I wanted Dean to leave.' After the stabbing, she said: ‘He just went silent. I went into the living room and sat on the sofa. ‘He sat down. Then all of a sudden he dropped on the floor. That’s when I knew it was really serious. Ms Merrilees (left with her boyfriend and right outside the Old Bailey) was told she was free to leave the court . ‘As he was on the floor I was screaming.’ Mr Williamson had criminal convictions and had previously been a suspect in an armed robbery, but the case was dropped, the court heard. Katie O’Brien, a friend of the couple who returned to the flat with them on the night of the stabbing, said they had been arguing violently and at one stage Mr Williamson had his hands around his girlfriend's throat. Ms O’Brien said she went into the bathroom and did not see the stabbing itself. She then saw the bouncer 'stagger into the living room and then he fell on the couch holding his left chest,’ said Mr Finnegan. Mr Williamson gasped: ‘Stabbed, Kate. Stabbed’. He died a day after he was airlifted to hospital for open heart surgery. Ms Merrilees told the jury: ‘I accept I caused the injury to Dean Williamson. At all times I was in fear that I would be seriously injured by him. ‘I didn’t want him to kill me. ‘At no point was it my intention to kill Dean Williamson.'","Old Bailey jury cleared Annie Merrilees, 25, after less than three hours .

"Almost half of adults overestimate how big their waists can get before it potentially has an impact on their hearts, a survey has found. Medical opinion is that women are at increased risk of heart disease if their waist strays over 32 inches, while men should not exceed 37 inches. However, over 40 per cent of respondents thought their bellies had to be bigger to do any harm, and 20 per cent thought they could get away with a waist size of 40 inches for men and 35 inches for women. Scroll down for video . Almost half of adults overestimate how big their waists can get before it may have an impact on their hearts . The figures in the online YouGov poll relate to 46 per cent of men and 43 per cent of women. Overall, fewer than half of adults (42 per cent) were aware of the threshold for high blood pressure (a reading of 140/90) which can increase the risk of heart attack and stroke, and almost half of adults (46 per cent) didn’t know what a healthy Body Mass Index is. Body Mass Index is calculated by dividing your weight in kilograms by your height in metres squared. A healthy BMI is between 18.5 and 25. The survey also found that more than a third of people (34 per cent) underestimated how much exercise they should be doing a week. Only 15 per cent knew that adults are advised to do 30 minutes of exercise, five times a week to maintain a healthy heart yet. The charity says the findings, published to coincide with World Heart Day, mean that millions of people are putting the health of their heart at risk because they are not taking the necessary steps to prevent heart disease. Heart disease ranks bottom of the list of health concerns for most people even though it is the UK’s single biggest killer claiming 73,000 lives a year. Just two per cent of Britons are afraid of developing the condition, according to the poll of over 2,000 people for the British Heart Foundation. This compares with 33 per cent who worry about developing dementia, 29 per cent who are afraid of cancer, nine per cent who dread Motor Neurone Disease and six per cent who fear a stroke. Just two per cent of Britons are afraid of developing heart disease, according to a British heart Foundation poll . The only conditions to rank alongside heart disease are Parkinson’s and the Ebola virus. Furthermore, although most people are aware of the risk factors for developing heart disease, such as high blood pressure, being overweight, a sedentary lifestyle and poor diet, they don’t actually know what this means. It also raises the question why despite huge awareness campaigns for heart disease, the messages are not getting through. Dr Mike Knapton, Associate Medical Director at the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘Your heart is the most vital organ in your body, but all too often we take it for granted. ‘Despite being a largely preventable condition, coronary heart disease is still the UK’s single biggest killer, causing unnecessary heartache for thousands of families. 'By taking control of your heart health, you can invest in and enjoy your future health and life.’ Maureen Talbot, a Senior Cardiac Nurse at the charity, added: ‘There are still people out there that think heart disease will never happen to them and are shocked when it does. ‘Showing the benefits of reducing risk factors is quite a slow process and although things have improved, it is not always obvious. There is always more than can be done to get the right message out at the right time.’","Women at increased risk of heart disease if their waist strays over 32 inches .

"A photograph of a mother breastfeeding her severely premature baby for the first time has gone viral after it was removed from Facebook because it ‘breached nudity rules’. Emma Bond, 24, posted the picture of herself with Carene, who was born 12 weeks early, on Sunday. It was visible only to those she had approved as online friends. The mother of two was shocked when the site removed it the same day after an anonymous person – presumed to be one of her friends – reported it as offensive. 'Natural and special': Emma Bond, 24,  was upset after Facebook removed an image of her with baby Carene . Mother and baby: Miss Bond, who owns a children’s soft play centre with her partner, lives in Oswestry . In protest, she uploaded the image to a pro-breastfeeding Facebook group, and it gained 166,000 ‘likes’. But on Monday, the 22,000 users who re-posted it also had their links deleted. Carene was born on October 3, weighing 2lb 2oz, but Miss Bond and partner Ashley Kitchen, 30, were warned that she would not live more than three days. At home in Oswestry, Shropshire, Miss Bond said: ‘Two weeks prior to this being taken, I was told my daughter would die, so to then find yourself able to breastfeed was an incredible step. Breastfeeding: Miss Bond posted this image with Carene, which was deemed 'offensive' on Facebook . ‘The original photo was only viewable by my friends and family. 'Everyone was aware it was touch and go, so I was sharing the special moment with people to show them how far she had come. ‘It was a magical moment and to have it removed the same day for breaching nudity policies was really rubbing salt in the wound.’ Despite her remarkable survival, Carene is likely to have suffered serious brain damage. Miss Bond and Mr Kitchen, who owns a children’s play centre, travel to the Princess Royal Hospital in Telford every day to see her. Thousands have backed Miss Bond online, with women posting breastfeeding images in support. Facebook user Laura Simmonds said: . ‘Trouble with our world today, it’s OK for young girls to post pictures of themselves half-naked but when they see something so innocent and beautiful, it’s an offence. Where’s the sense in that?’ After hundreds of complaints, Facebook reinstated the black-and-white photo and said it was ‘removed in error’. Backing: Miss Bond (left, today; and right, while pregnant) has received hundreds of messages of support . Miss Bond said: ‘I see so many animal cruelty or beheading or child abuse images on Facebook and report them myself, but nothing gets done. 'But something as precious and natural as this is removed instead. I know they put the image back up but it shouldn’t take thousands of people to make a stand for that to happen. 'I still haven’t got an explanation or apology.’ A Facebook spokesman said breastfeeding photos were never against its standards, but in the past nipples had to be hidden. The site wrote to Miss Bond saying its policy had been updated to ‘better examine the context’ of images, allowing breasts to be shown in nursing and mastectomy pictures. Severely premature: Miss Bond and her partner Ashley Kitchen, 30, were warned Carene (pictured) would not survive more than three days when she was born prematurely on October 3 weighing just 2lbs 2oz . Bleeds: Miss Bond is still travelling to the Princess Royal Hospital in Telford every day to see Carene (above) In April last year an American mother criticised Facebook for taking down pictures of women breastfeeding their children from a support page she created for other mothers. Kristy Kemp, of Sacramento, California, was also barred from the page for days after the images were shared, even though Facebook said it did not ban nursing pictures, MailOnline reported. It follows a controversy on photo-sharing website Instagram in June which saw a mother’s account deactivated after she posted a pictured of her 19-month-old daughter showing off her belly button. The Daily Mail told how mother-of-four Courtney Adamo, 33, of north London, was sent an email by the Facebook-owned firm saying the image of Marlow ‘violated the community guidelines’. And in March, mother Emily Slough, spoke of her outrage after a stranger took a picture of her breastfeeding her daughter in public and uploaded it to Facebook, branding her a 'tramp'. MailOnline reported how Mrs Slough, from Rugeley, Staffordshire, was photographed when she stopped to feed her eight-month-old, Matilda, on the steps of a restaurant and have some lunch. Six years ago, the original decision by Facebook to ban mothers from posting 'inappropriate' photos of them breastfeeding their children caused protests by women's groups in the U.S. MailOnline reported how the campaign had picked up speed in 2008 when protesters organised a virtual 'nurse-in' on the site, as well as a demonstration outside Facebook's offices in California.","Emma Bond posted image with Carene, who was born 12 weeks early .

(picture shows gun enthusiasts viewing a wall of Smith & Wesson handguns during a National Rifle Association convention) Shockingly, the New York Times, which revealed the figures through a Freedom of Information request, reported that fewer than 300 of the people on the list had a handgun permit, which would then have been revoked. Officials say they're unsure how many guns were seized. Mental health professionals must report patients seen as likely to cause serious harm to themselves or others. If county officials agree, the patients go into the database for five years. The names aren't public. But sources told the Times that the typical diagnoses are schizophrenia, psychosis or major depression. The paper cited one case concerning  a patient who had threatened to kill his partner. 'Becomes aggressive and unpredictable, has history of noncompliance with medications,' the Times reported the narrative as saying. Mentally ill: On December 14, 2012, Adam Lanza, who spent his entire life troubled by mental illness,  walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School and shot dead 20 first-graders and six educators with a semi-automatic rifle before shooting himself. Before the spree he murdered his mother . 'Two patients had attempted suicide with guns,' the Times added. 'Another “is exhibiting manic behavior,” the note said. It added that the patient was “not sleeping in the past few days, throwing lit cigarettes and matches around the house,” and had “a history of fire setting.”' Some mental health advocates fear too many people are being deemed dangerous. '[The figure] seems extraordinarily high to me,' Sam Tsemberis, a former director of New York City’s involuntary hospitalization program for homeless and dangerous people, now the chief executive of Pathways to Housing, which provides housing to the mentally ill, told the Times. 'Assumed dangerousness is a far cry from actual dangerousness.' However, gun control advocates say the potential consequences merit casting a wide net. The New York Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act of 2013, commonly known as the NY SAFE Act, was established in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. The tragedy saw mentally-ill student Adam Lanza shoot dead 20 first-graders and six educators with a semi-automatic rifle on December 14, 2012, before shooting himself. Before the spree he murdered his mother, Nancy.","Figure revealed by New York Times after Freedom of Information request .

"Conceived naturally: An Australian woman with 12 children has given birth to quintuplets (file photo) A woman who already had 12 children has given birth to quintuplets after conceiving them naturally. The 48-year-old woman from Melbourne, Australia gave birth to two boys and three girls by caesarean section today. Tragically one of the girls died before the birth. A team of 30 specialists including paediatricians, anaesthetists and nursing staff delivered the five babies, the first quintuplets in Melbourne for three decades. The chances of conceiving quintuplets naturally is about one in 55 million, doctors say. A spokesman for Monash Medical Centre where the historical birth took place said: ‘Mum is doing well. ‘One unfortunately did not make it.’ The four surviving babies will be cared for around the clock in the hospital's neonatal intensive care unit. According to Channel Seven, the family of 16 children, who wished not to be identified, is now one of the largest families in the Australian state of Victoria. The last quintuplets born in Victoria were the Kissane quintuplets in 1980 who were born 11 weeks premature. None of the babies survived. 30 medical specialists: Born at Monash Medical Centre in Melbourne, the Australian quintuplets were born by caesarean section today .

"The mother of 19-year-old cancer victim Stephen Sutton has said she is 'immensely proud' of her son after it was revealed he raised almost £5million for charity. He inspired the biggest ever fundraiser the Teenage Cancer Trust has ever seen and became a household name with his 46-item bucket list. The teenager from Burntwood, Staffordshire, was diagnosed with bowel cancer at 15, but he approached the disease with good humour and stoicism. Scroll down for video . The 19-year-old helped raise almost £5million for cancer research charities after his struggle with bowel cancer went viral . His mother Jane Sutton said: 'My son Stephen was courageous and inspirational. His selfless fundraising and positive attitude touched people across the world and the huge outpouring of love and support he received in return was humbling. 'Stephen believed that every young person with cancer has an inspiring story to tell and I know that so many young people in the same position as Stephen also fundraise in support of Teenage Cancer Trust. 'Stephen was passionate about supporting Teenage Cancer Trust, a charity that helped him understand that 'he may have had cancer but cancer didn't have him'. 'This money will make a significant difference to other young people with cancer and that would have made Stephen very happy. The teenager's mother Jane Sutton (pictured) said she was immensely proud of her son who died in May. They are pictured with David Cameron and Professor Gary Middleton earlier this year . His 'weird and wonderful' bucket list included skydiving and organising a charity gig . 'Stephen showed us how incredibly powerful even very small positive acts can be when lots of people get involved. I'm immensely proud of everything he achieved. We will never forget Stephen, and his positivity will live on through Stephen's Story for Teenage Cancer Trust.' After being told the cancer was incurable in 2012, he drew up a list of 'weird and wonderful' things he wanted to do before he died. He spent the next two years achieving the vast majority of them, including playing the drums in front of a crowd of 90,000 at  Wembley, skydiving and writing a book. By the time he died in May this year, he had already raised more than £3million, exceeding his original £10,000 goal. Hugging an animal larger than himself was one of the goals on the 19-year-old's bucket list . He crowdsurfed in a rubber dingy at a gig and organised parties in aid of the Teenage Cancer Trust . His campaign reached a huge new audience after he posted what he called 'a final Thumbs Up' on Facebook on 22 April this year, after his deteriorating condition saw him rushed to hospital. The post was shared by 76,000 people and his fundraising target soon tipped over the £1million mark. His bucket list won the hearts of thousands of supporters - including Prime Minister David Cameron and comedian Jason Manford. The money raised will go towards funding new  teenage cancer units at seven NHS hospitals in England and Scotland, and the foundation of 50 Stephen Sutton Scholarships to train specialist cancer nurses. His bucket list won the hearts of thousands  - including comedians John Bishop (left) and Jimmy Carr (right) He inspired thousands of people across with his positive attitude after being diagnosed with bowel cancer . It will also pay for 1,500 teenage cancer patients to attend special events to learn, share experiences and make friends with others in their situation. In a YouTube video, the teenager from Burntwood, Staffordshire, spoke of how he did not want 'to be remembered as someone who didn't fulfil their potential'. And despite not being able to become a doctor, he had stuck to his 'core purpose' of helping others. Teenage Cancer Trust chief exectuive Siobhan Dunn said: 'Stephen trusted us to spend the money well and to 'keep doing what we do' and this is reflected in our plans. However, Stephen has also allowed us to be more ambitious. 'Stephen's Story will help us reach some huge milestones for young people with cancer across the UK but we know that for every young person we can help, there's another we can't so there remains much more to do. 'Stephen's gift to a charity of our size is more than money - the awareness raised of cancer in young people and new supporters inspired by Stephen will be essential if we are to help every young person with cancer who needs us.' His most important goal on the bucket list was to raise £10,000, but he also visited Number 10 Downing Street .

"A super-wealthy couple of web entrepreneurs who sold Bebo for £370 million are investing cash to save a derelict pub - in Devon. Michael and Xochi Birch, who are based in California, received the staggering sum for the social network in 2008. They have now given themselves a new project - bringing a rundown pub back to its former glory. The Farmers Arms in Woolsery, North Devon, closed in 2012 and has fallen into disrepair. It has now been saved because millionaire Michael Birch says the village is his 'spiritual home'. Grand designs: The Farmers Arms pub in Woolsery, Devon, which has been rescued by a  couple who netted millions from the sale of social networking site Bebo . Michael and Xochi Birch, who founded Bebo in 2005 and sold it to AOL in 2008 for $850million, have bought the Farmers Arms pub. Mr Birch says the village is his 'spiritual home' He was born in Hertfordshire but his family ties in the village date back to the 1700s, when the Andrew family came to Woolsery. Job Andrew, Mr Birch's great-great grandfather, built Woolsery village shop, which remained in the family until it was sold in 1961. His grandmother, Millicent Andrew, was born in the village shop's premises in 1900, and his grandfather Joseph Burrow was born at Ashcroft Farm. The pub will be restored to its former glory and the Manor House which they also bought will be turned into a hotel. The Manor House which they also bought will be turned into a hotel. Job Andrew, Mr Birch's great-great grandfather, built Woolsery village shop, which remained in the family until it was sold in 1961 . Mr Birch was born in Hertfordshire but his family ties in the village date back to the 1700s, when the Andrew family came to Woolsery . Michael, 44, said: 'We share the local community's enthusiasm for the Farmers Arms and Manor House. These buildings are important assets and will be tastefully restored. 'Before we put out the welcome mat we ask everyone for their support, cooperation and patience as we undertake the mammoth task of planning and restoring the buildings to their rightful place of historical significance in the village of Woolsery.' Michael and his wife set up Bebo in 2005 with the social media website shorthand for 'Blog Early, Blog Often'. Locals in Woolsery are hoping their midas touch will pay off with their purchase of the pub and manor house . It was a huge success and became one of the world's most popular websites with AOL buying it for $850 million three years later. The couple made $600 million from the sale but then had to watch as the site crumbled, in part due to  the meteoric rise of Facebook. Last year they bought the site back for $1 million 'for fun' to see if they could inject life into it. Locals in Woolsery are hoping their midas touch will pay off with their purchase of the pub and manor house. Robin Edmonds, chairman of Woolsery Parish Council, said: 'The centre of our once picturesque rural village has been blighted in recent times by the presence of two Grade II listed buildings that have been allowed to fall into a very sad state of disrepair. 'The Parish Council is very relieved to learn that not only have the Farmers Arms and Manor House been sold, but that they have been sold to the same buyer who has a long term association with Woolsery village and a very strong desire to return both properties to their former glory.' Villagers on the Woolsery Action Group Facebook page have also expressed their excitement over the development. Mr Edmonds added: 'The residents of Woolsery are very fortunate to find a new owner who is passionate about restoring the pub and is happy to make the considerable investment required to achieve this. 'The restoration of the Manor House and putting it into use as a hotel is an unexpected bonus for the whole village. 'The transformation of these two buildings will not happen overnight, but we look forward to seeing them both once again contributing to the daily life of the village in the foreseeable future.'","Michael and Xochi Birch received staggering sum for social network in 2008 .

"Sarah Collins Rudolph said she has forgiven the people who carried out the 1963 atrocity in which she lost her sister and one of her eyes . A key point in the Civil Rights movement happened 50 years ago when four young black girls were killed after the Ku Klux Klan bombed a church in Birmingham, Alabama. The girls' deaths shocked the nation and was instrumental in the passage of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bans discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin. On Friday, President Obama signed a law to honor the victims of the bombing - 14-year-olds Addie Mae Collins, Carole Robertson and Cynthia Wesley, and 11-year-old Denise McNair - with the Congressional Gold Medal. One of the survivors of the blast was Sarah Collins Rudolph, whose sister Addie was killed. Despite losing her sister and also one of her eyes as a result of the blast, she had told CBS News that she no longer feels bitterness about the incident. ‘Being bitter won't bring the girls back, won't bring my sight back. So I had to forgive because it was what God wanted me to do,’ she said. During the civil rights movement of the 1960s, the 16th Baptist Church served as an organizational headquarters for blacks protesting institutionalized racism in the South. Martin Luther King, Jr. was a frequent speaker there. On Sunday, September 15, 1963, the Ku Klux Klan planted dynamite outside the church blowing a gaping hole in the wall and killing the four girls, who were in the bathroom. Denise McNair, 11, and Carole Robertson, 14, were both killed in the bomb blast in September 1963 . Addie Mae Collins, 14, and Cynthia Wesley, 14, were honored on Friday with the congressional gold medal . Mrs. Rudolph was showered with debris and flying glass from the blast and spent nearly three months in hospital. Doctors also had to remove her right eye. She now wears a prosthesis and still has pieces of glass in her left eye. While she has learned to forgive with time, the past 50 years have been tough for Mrs. Rudolp. ‘When I would go to bed at night, I would just cry all night long, just why did they kill those girls,’ she said. ‘Addie never did anything for someone to kill her.’ President Obama signed a bill into law on Friday granting the United States' highest civilian honor to the four girls killed in 1963. Ambulance attendants load the body of an African American girl, one of four killed in the bombing of the 16th Avenue Church, Sept. 16, 1963, Birmingham, Ala. This large crater is the result of a bomb that exploded near a basement room of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala. on September 15, 1963 . ‘They gave their all,’ said U.S. Representative John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat and influential civil rights leader. ‘This medal will serve as a compelling reminder of the sacrifices so many freedom fighters made to help us achieve equality and social change,’ Terri Sewell, an Alabama Democrat, and one of the bill's sponsors, said in a statement. In 1963, Alabama was the center of a non-violent civil rights movement led by Martin Luther King and others that was met with violence from the Ku Klux Klan and state and local officials trying to enforce racial segregation laws. ‘The civil rights victories were achieved by the principles of non-violence. Love carried the day against hate,’ Spencer Bachus, an Alabama Republican, who also sponsored the bill. Mourners follow the coffin of a young church bombing victim during a funeral in 1963 . On Friday President Barack Obama signed a bill designating the Congressional Gold Medal commemorating the lives of the four young girls killed . Scheduled to attend the White House signing ceremony were Birmingham Mayor William Bell and Doug Jones, a former prosecutor who finally brought the last two church bombers to justice in 2001 and 2002. Also attending were family members of Denise McNair and Carole Robertson. ‘We feel that this honor given by Congress means that our great country recognizes the sacrifices made for freedom in our country,’ Lisa McNair, the 49-year-old sister of Denise McNair, told Reuters. But the families of Addie Mae Collins and Cynthia Wesley have criticized the medals as useless symbolism for families who received little compensation for an atrocious act. ‘They were murdered. I am not going to go get the Congressional Medal until justice has been fulfilled. I want restitution,’ Mrs. Rudolph told Reuters. She has asked for $5 million in compensation as a victim of terrorism. The medals are to be awarded at a Congressional ceremony later this year and will be displayed in the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute.","Sarah Collins Rudolph survived the 1963 bomb blast which killed her sister and three others .

"Senior Liberal Democrats were accused of a ‘chicken run’ from the Coalition last night as three MPs left the Government so they can concentrate on holding their Commons seats. After Home Office minister Norman Baker quit, Nick Clegg also had to find replacements for two Lib Dem whips – Mark Hunter and Jenny Willott – who decided to stand down. Tory MPs ridiculed their Coalition partners for what they suggested was a misguided attempt to distance themselves from the Government amid fears of a drubbing at May’s General Election. Scroll down for video . Lib Dem whips Mark Hunter, left, and Jenny Willott, right who have both decided to stand down with claims they are trying to distance themselves from the government in time for next year's General Election . Theresa May was last night installed as the favourite to succeed David Cameron as Tory MPs cheered her for forcing out the ‘eccentric’ Mr Baker. The steely Home Secretary overtook Boris Johnson in a poll of Conservative members on who should be the next party leader. Mr Cameron backed Mrs May, saying she was ‘tough and robust’ to deal with but that was her strength. Of Mr Baker’s departure, the Prime Minister said scathingly: ‘We’ll cope without him.’ He added: ‘I have worked with Theresa May for eight or nine years. She is a very effective politician, a very effective administrator. I want someone who is a tough Home Secretary – it’s a tough world out there.’ Chancellor George Osborne also dismissed Mr Baker’s resignation, mocking him in the Commons as a ‘conspiracy theorist’. Mr Baker, a former transport minister, was appointed to the Home Office last year after Mr Clegg axed Home Office minister Jeremy Browne, one of the leading figures on the Lib Dem right. Liberal Democrat Norman Baker arrives at the party's HQ in central London yesterday, a day after resigning as Home Office minister . Mrs May was given no forewarning of his appointment, which was condemned as an ‘elaborate Lib Dem in-joke’ by Tory MPs. Mr Baker has written a book, in which he suggested UN weapons inspector Dr David Kelly was murdered by an Iraqi hit squad and the incident was covered up by British security services. He has also said he believes the death of former Labour foreign secretary Robin Cook may have been suspicious. Government sources were astonished that Mr Baker had been promoted to a position in which he was expected to work closely with the security services, having expressed such views. Home Secretary Theresa May was last night installed as the favourite to succeed David Cameron as Tory MPs cheered her for forcing out the ‘eccentric’ Mr Baker . Announcing his resignation, Mr Baker likened working with the Home Secretary to ‘walking through mud’, accusing her of refusing to agree to his policy proposals. In particular, the two clashed over Mr Baker’s controversial suggestion that the possession of drugs should be decriminalised. He said: ‘The Home Secretary was reluctant to let me have my head and it was a constant battle to try to get things through. ‘I have done it for a year, it is very hard work – the Home Office is probably at the cutting edge of the Coalition. It is where most policy issues are difficult, whether it is Europe or immigration. It has not been helped by the lurch to the right from the Conservative party as they chase Ukip off to the fringes.’ Mr Baker, a member of a rock band, The Reform Club, added: ‘I want a break. I want to spend more time with my family, more time in my constituency, more time doing stuff I want to do, like my music.’ Tory sources said Mr Baker was leaving to try to distance himself from the Government and seek to defend his majority of 7,000 in Lewes, under threat because of the Lib Dem collapse in the polls. One said: ‘He was never at the Home Office. He was only there two days a week. He spent most of Mondays in his constituency and then he was away by Thursday morning to prepare for his local radio show.’ The source added: ‘He never got on with Theresa. I think he was one of those people who have trouble working for a powerful woman. He did not report to her. He came in and announced he was effectively the Lib Dem home secretary. Not surprisingly, he was told where to go.’ Former Tory Home Office minister Damian Green said tensions had arisen because Mr Baker had tried to act as if he had the same ministerial rank as Mrs May. He said: ‘He regarded himself as being on a par with the Home Secretary and asked for papers from other ministers – he wanted to check what everyone else was doing.’ ‘The world doesn’t work like that. He was a guitarist who was only interested in his own solos while the rest of the band was trying to play a close harmony number.’ But Lib Dem president Tim Farron complained: ‘Theresa May behaves as though the Conservatives won the last election. They didn’t and it’s an insult to the electorate to act as though they did.’ Last night, a poll of members by the ConservativeHome website found Mrs May has the backing of 24 per cent as the party’s next leader – ahead of Mr Johnson, who has led for several months, on 22 per cent. Mr Clegg moved international development minister Lynne Featherstone, who worked at the Home Office between 2010 and 2012, back to her old department to replace Mr Baker. Norman Baker’s bitter parting shot at Theresa May was that, while he had been able to work perfectly amicably with Tory colleagues at the Department for Transport, the Home Office had been like ‘walking through mud’. Undoubtedly, this is true. But if his resignation was timed to inflict maximum damage on Mrs May – who has endured a wretched week, lurching from immigration scandals, to the ongoing sex abuse inquiry debacle – it backfired spectacularly. Indeed, she will have positively purred at Mr Baker’s comment that she regards the Home Office ‘as a Conservative department in a Conservative government’. Mr Baker was said to have been kept on a short leash from the outset by the Home Secretary and her advisers . She does – and many backbench Tories wish her Cabinet colleagues would take the same position, rather than pandering to Lib Dems on the verge of electoral annihilation. Mr Baker was kept on a short leash from the outset by the Home Secretary and her advisers. But should this really have come as a surprise to the Lib Dem – and who can blame Mrs May for not letting this political maverick loose in a department where one slip can be lethal? The only mystery is why Nick Clegg ever considered Mr Baker a suitable candidate to be sent to the Home Office (other than to irritate Mrs May, who is his biggest enemy in the Cabinet). On his first day in the job, Mr Baker was forced to defend his oft-stated view – contained in a book he authored while not in government – that British spies covered up the murder of scientist Dr David Kelly by an Iraqi hit squad. Mrs May, who dominates her Home Office department like no other Cabinet minister in Whitehall . It was hardly an auspicious start to life in the department which oversees MI5 and it soon became clear there would be significant tensions with Mrs May. Mr Baker’s two Lib Dem predecessors at the Home Office had caused her little trouble. Jeremy Browne, on the right of Mr Clegg’s party, was respected within the department and rarely strayed into controversy. Lynne Featherstone, who now returns to the department for a second stint, stuck to a brief covering equalities – on which she and Mrs May largely agree. Mr Baker, by contrast, wanted to find differences of opinion with the Tories – and for them to be known about publicly. He also wanted to behave like a ‘Lib Dem home secretary’, challenging the authority of Mrs May, who dominates her department like no other Cabinet minister in Whitehall and whose junior ministers very much understand their subordinate role. There was an initial skirmish on gun laws. Mr Baker wanted to increase the £50 fee for a licence. The Tories, conscious of not upsetting the countryside, blocked him. He also went off on a tangent from time to time, accusing retailers of encouraging shoplifting by introducing self-service tills. But it was on drugs where the real bust-ups occurred. Mrs May repeatedly thwarted his plans, including pilot projects for GP prescribing of heroin, licences for medical use of cannabis, and free foil to reduce the harm involved in injecting heroin. Last week, she immediately binned a Home Office review, which the Lib Dems had insisted on commissioning, on the case for decriminalising the use of some drugs. Some allies of Mr Baker sought to portray this as the final straw, but he had been planning to walk away for a couple of months – not least because of the need to defend his vulnerable majority in Lewes, East Sussex. But he has done Mrs May a huge favour with the manner of his departure and his complaints that she will not play nicely with her junior partners. The only loose cannon in her department has gone and her leadership credentials are, if anything, bolstered.","A total of three Lib Dem MPs have quit the government to focus on seats .

"Scotland's richest woman has been blasted by campaigners after she closed a Battle of Britain airport she purchased for just £1 and vowed to keep open for at least two years. Ann Gloag purchased Manston Airport in Kent in November for the nominal fee, but had to accept £23 million worth of loans inherited from the previous owners. In November, Ms Gloag vowed to keep the airport operating but within six months it has closed. Scottish Millionaire Ann Gloag purchased Manston Airport in November 2013 and pledged to keep it open for at least two years . However, the airport's owners entered into a consultation process with staff in March about the future of the facility . The airport closed for what could be the final time on May 15 . There are now plans to under consideration to built 1,000 homes on part of the site. It is understood that shortly before the closure, the airport's owners rejected a £7 million takeover bid to secure the future of the facility. Mrs Goag is the founder of transport company Stagecoach and is understood to be worth an estimated £500 million. Manston Airport was developed as an aerodrome during World War I as a base for the newly created Royal Flying Corps. It was also used by Sir Barnes Wallace to develop his 'bouncing bomb' which was used during the Dam Busters raid. Speaking at the time of the purchase, Mrs Gloag said: 'I am delighted to have purchased Manston Airport from Infratil as I believe there is real potential for growth that has not been fully captured. 'I have said for 25 years now that the airport will never really succeed until we have a one-hour link from London to Manston. That is achievable and on track.' The Save Manston Airport group claim that the airstrip is a vital piece of infrastructure in the South East . During the Second World War RAF Manston was right at the front for the Battle of Britain and was used by Sir Barnes Wallace to test his bouncing bomb used in the Dam Busters Raid . Manston Airport was originally used by the Royal Flying Corps during World War I . However, on March 19, the management advised staff that they were entering 'a period of consultation over the possible closure of the airport'. The announcement prompted KLM to suspend its twice daily flights between Manston and Amsterdam. The service began operating shortly before Mrs Gloag purchased the facility. Local residents and trade unions have expressed outrage over the closure which will cost almost 600 jobs in the Thanet area. Some residents want Thanet District Council to lodge a compulsory purchase order on the airstrip. The council has tasked an official will investigating the possibility and senior officials plan to meet Mrs Gloag to discuss her plans. A spokesperson said: 'The council has been clear that it supports activity that retains the existing footprint of the airport as an airport, and was disappointed that recent bids to save Manston were not successful. 'The council is also keen to dismiss recent inaccurate reports regarding discussions between the council and airport owners to develop housing on the existing footprint of the airport.' According to the Save Manston Airport Group, the facility is only 20 minutes from Brussels and 35 minutes from Amsterdam . Commenting on development plans, the council said: 'The owners of Manston Airport put forward a proposed site for allocation as part of the Local plan discussions, where options for the ""Northern Grass"" (redundant land - not currently used for airport activity) were raised, including the possible development of housing. 'However, as the proposal does not fit in with the council’s current approach to allocating housing sites, no decision, or indication that this would have been an acceptable proposal was made by officers. 'As part of this discussion, there was no reference to any plans to change the use of the airport or to develop the land which is used for airport activity.' A spokesperson added: 'The council has consistently recognised Manston Airport as an important economic asset for the district and has been explicitly clear of its commitment to work alongside the Thanet MPs and Kent County Council as part of a task force to support the retention of the airport.' Speaking to The Observer, Ian McCoulough of Unite who represent the airport's fire fighters said: 'She just wanted to strip the value of the land and the properties on it.' The paper said Mrs Gloag refused to comment about her future plans for the airport. According to the Save Manston Airport action group, if the facility is shut down permanently it will likely be developed into either 'shoebox houses' or retail park. A spokesperson said that more than 14,000 people have signed a petition to counter the closure. According to the group: 'The airfield is largely undeveloped and could suit a variety of uses, only being 20 minutes flying time from Brussels and 35 minutes to Amsterdam.' Last week several hundred people marched to the airport demonstrating against its continued closure. Residents fear that the 700 acre site will be used to build homes.","Campaigners fear Manston Airport will be redeveloped for housing .

"It sounds like a creature from mythical lore, but a two-headed mutant snake has been spotted slithering its way through a village in India. The snake, which is believed to be a checkered keelback, was seen crawling past a house in Burdwan, West Bengal. The non-venamous snake slithered onto Apurba Ghosh's patio, leaving him just enough time to capture the magical moment on his camera phone. And in a flash it was gone, wriggling into a bush before he had a chance to catch it. It was never seen again. Beware the two-headed snake! The snake, which is believed to be a checkered keelback, was seen crawling past a house in Burdwan, West Bengal . 'It happened at the blink of an eye. The snake came across and was gliding along the surface,' Apurba said. 'I only managed to take shots with my phone. It was all gone within seconds.' The two-headed creature then slinked away into the nearby bushes before it could be caught. The village of Burdwan is known for sightings of snakes, including the mighty King Cobra. Slippery customer: The two-headed creature then slinked away into the nearby bushes before it could be caught . Heads up! The snake is reminiscent of the seven-headed Hydra from Greek mythology which grows two new heads every time one is cut off. This still from the 1963 film 'Jason And the Argonauts', shows actor Todd Armstrong fighting the creature . Ghosh, who lives in the village, added: 'Snakes are sighted here very often because of close proximity to the forests. But they don't attack humans. The condition of having more than one head is known as polycephaly, with two-headedness described specifically by the terms bicephaly or dicephaly. But the creatures rarely live beyond a few months. Each head of a polycephalic animal has its own brain, and they share control of the organs and limbs, though the specific structure of the connections varies. Such animals often move in a disoriented and dizzy fashion, with the brains 'arguing' with each other leading some specimens to simply zig-zag without getting anywhere. In 1998, a calf was born with two heads in Iowa (pictured). Farmer Garry Slife named it Reflection. In snakes, each head may attack and even attempt to swallow the other. 'Some animals, mostly dogs and other pets, are bitten once in a while. 'Some villagers also worship these snakes because they are regarded as highly auspicious in the Hindu religion.' The condition of having more than one . head is known as polycephaly, with two-headedness described specifically . by the terms bicephaly or dicephaly. But the creatures rarely live beyond a few months. According to Hindu mythology, a five-headed cobra called Sheshnag is holding the world up on its 'hoods' - the flap of skin behind the head that the cobra puffs out when wanting to scare off potential threats. Though nobody has seen a five-headed reptile so far, two-headed snakes have been seen on several occasions over the years, although most only live for a few months. It is also reminiscent of the seven-headed Lernaean Hydra from Greek mythology which guarded the gates of the underworld and was said to grow two new heads every time one was cut off. The Hydra, whose breath and blood was so poisonous that even its tracks were deadly, was killed by Heracles as the second of his Twelve Labours. It also appears in the 1963 film Jason and the Argonauts. Rare: A two-headed piglet was born in 1997 on a farm in Kersey, Colorado, while, in 2006, a two-headed calf was born in the Upper Egyptian village of Azedenia near Luxor .

"These are the first photographs taken inside the mysterious Tibetan city of Lhasa during a British expedition over a hundred years ago. British Army soldiers are believed to be some of the first westerners to enter the capital city - often known as the Forbidden City due to its remoteness and the clergy's hostility towards those from abroad. As a result, these images taken during the 1904 expedition showed the beautiful landscape and surroundings of Lhasa to the west for the first time.

"Alleged misconduct: Mary Gilles, 28, was arrested at her apartment in Austin, Minnesota, after allegedly engaging in a sexual relationship with an underage male student at Pacelli High School . A 28-year-old Catholic school teacher was fired this week after allegedly engaging in a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old male student. According to court filings, police reviewed emails exchanged between math teacher Mary Gilles and the teenager and say several refer to her possibly carrying his child. Gilles was arrested Monday afternoon at her home in Austin on suspicion of third-degree criminal sexual conduct. An assistant principal at Pacelli was the first to discover the student was having a sexual relationship with his teacher according to the Star Tribune. When another staff member told Laura Marreel she saw Gilles and the student together in the auditorium 'at a late hour,' Marreel began looking into the teenager's emails. Saying she had 'a gut feeling,' the school administrator combed through the student's school email account, where she says she found the password to his personal email account. There she found emails with 'sexual relationship content' and a recent exchange of messages that 'referred to the defendant possibly being pregnant,' according to the criminal filing. In court filings, Gilles admits to engaging in sexual activity with the student beginning in February. The two cut things off during the summer before starting again in September. Gilles admitted to police in an interview that she knew her student was only 17 at the time of their relationship and said they had sex about once a month. Teacher: Gilles and her student were caught after a school staffer noticed they were spending time together at a late hour and the assistant principal searched through the student's personal email . The boy also spoke with police, telling investigators that he used a condom every time the two had sex from February to June, which he estimated was four or five times. The relationship stopped when he left for summer break, only to continue once he returned in late August. Leaders at the diocese say it is their policy to try and identify any misconduct and immediately report it to authorities. 'Our prayers go out to those who have suffered child sexual abuse and who have been harmed,' the Diocese of Winona told KMSP in a statement. Terminated: Gilles taught math at Pacelli High School. It was the school that reportedly tipped police off. Gilles was then fired following her arrest . 'We encourage anyone with information regarding child sexual abuse to immediately report that information to law enforcement and we remain committed to protect all God's children.' If convicted of criminal sexual conduct in the third degree, Gilles would face a maximum of 15 years prison or a fine of $30,000, or both. An unrelated investigation is currently underway at Pacelli, as the board of trustees have suspended President Jim Humberge and Principal Mary Holtorf 'pending the results of an internal investigation related to their administrative functions.' Allegations: Tennis coach Daniel Erik Hubbard-Wilson, 27 is said to have sexually assaulted a 16-year-old player on the team at Visitation School in Mendota Heights, Minnesota . Gilles's case was not even the first this week in which a Catholic school teacher in Minnesota was accused of having a sexual relationship with a student. Dan Erik Hubbard-Wilson, the tennis coach at Visitation School in Mendota Heights, was charged with criminal sexual conduct after he admitted to a sexual relationship with a 16-year-old student. Visitation is an all-girls school. Hubbard Wilson allegedly told police he was 25 when the relationship began.","Mary Gilles, 28, who taught math was arrested at her apartment in Austin, Minnesota, on Monday .

"Charlotte Parker, 32, a married teaching assistant, sent thousands of lewd texts to a schoolboy . A married teaching assistant sent thousands of lewd texts after starting a two-year affair with a schoolboy, 14, and threatened suicide when his parents found out. Charlotte Parker, 32, admitted engaging in sexual activity with the teenage pupil whilst she was working at Hylands Academy in Chelmsford, Essex. A jury at Basildon Crown Court today heard that the relationship began when the victim was 14 and sent her a Christmas card before spiralling into a two-year love affair. The victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was between 15 and 16 years of age during the time of offending. Austin Stoton, prosecuting, told the court the pair had exchanged around 3,000 WhatsApp mobile messages in less than a month between June 17 and July 14, 2013. He added: 'It seems the victim had explained that he had been seeing the defendant for a period of two years. 'He understood she was married. 'He explained they were close and believed they were going to buy a house together.' When Parker was told the victim's parents had found out about the affair she sent a message to the boy saying: 'Tonight is going to be the end of my life. 'I'll go quietly - I already have a bath ready.' An iPhone, iPad and Acer computer were seized from Mrs Parker’s home in Billericay, Essex, in September 2013 on which indecent images of the boy were found. Parker pleaded guilty to three counts of sexual activity with a child, two counts of making indecent images of a child and one count of encouraging a child to perform a sex act on himself. She denied two charges of attempting sexual intercourse with a child. Dale Beeson, mitigating, told the court his client had struggled with mental illness and depression for a decade describing hers as a 'tragic case'. Judge John Lodge sentenced her to 12 months in prison, suspended for two years. Addressing Parker directly, he said: 'Let me make this abundantly clear, this is a case of gross child abuse. 'People who work as teaching assistants, whatever their gender, who take advantage of victims, of any gender, commit very serious offences indeed. 'It makes no difference that the victim was a boy. Parker was given a 12-month suspended prison sentence for engaging in sexual activity with a child . 'It makes no difference he may have thought he was in a relationship with you. 'The law is there to stop people taking advantage of children. 'It is clear from the all the reports you clearly have psychiatric issues that pre-date the charges. 'It is also clear the victim knew this and was concerned about your welfare.' Judge Lodge said he was surprised Parker had been allowed to work in a school environment when her mental issues meant she would be 'very much at risk of becoming embroiled in a relationship.' Parker became tearful as she was told she would be ordered to sign onto the sex offenders register for 10 years and would be banned from working with children. Hylands Academy is a secondary school and sixth form college on the outskirts of Chelmsford, Essex, which caters for pupils aged 11 to 18 years old and currently has 700 students. Hylands School in Chelmsford, Essex, where Parker worked as a teaching assistant and met teenage boy . Parker has not worked at the school since the allegations came to light. A spokesperson from Hylands Academy said: 'The safety of our pupils is our priority and we take safeguarding very seriously. 'This is an isolated incident which has been dealt with according to all correct procedures. 'As soon as the incident came to light, the Academy acted to ensure the ex-member of staff had no contact with pupils and was not allowed on to school premises.

"With a growing sexual assault epidemic staining the military, President Barack Obama urged U.S. Naval Academy graduates Friday to remember their honor depends on what they do when nobody is looking and said the crime has 'no place in the greatest military on earth.' The commander in chief congratulated the 1,047 midshipmen graduating at the Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium, telling the 841 men and 206 women that they have proven themselves morally by meeting rigorous standards at the academy. But their commencement celebration came in the midst of reports of widespread sexual assault throughout the military, and Obama ended his 20-minute address by recognizing 'how the misconduct of some can have effects that ripple far and wide.' 'Those who commit sexual assault are not only committing a crime, they threaten the trust and discipline that makes our military strong,' Obama said. 'That's why we have to be determined to stop these crimes, because they've got no place in the greatest military on Earth.'

Ecstatic: Academy graduates throw their hats at the conclusion of their graduation ceremony . Happy grad: A graduate celebrates as President Barack Obama (left) greets other graduates arriving on stage . His pointed comments were aimed at rooting out the problem at a time when Republicans have been criticizing Obama for not responding forcefully enough to controversies including last year's deadly attack in Libya and political targeting at the IRS. But Obama was quick to express outrage over the reports of sexual assault, saying he has no tolerance for it. He summoned military leaders to the White House last week and instructed them to lead a process to root out the problem. The Pentagon released a report earlier this month estimating that as many as 26,000 military members may have been sexually assaulted last year and that thousands of victims are unwilling to come forward despite new oversight and assistance programs. That figure is an increase over the 19,000 estimated assaults in 2011. Several recent arrests have added to the military's embarrassment. A soldier at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point was charged with secretly photographing women, including in a bathroom. The Air Force officer who led the service's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response unit was arrested on charges of groping a woman. And the manager of the Army's sexual assault response program at Fort Campbell, Ky., was relieved of his post after his arrest in a domestic dispute with his ex-wife.

The applause that had accompanied earlier portions of Obama's Naval Academy speech, as he mentioned the Navy Seal's killing of Osama bin Laden and called for the building of a powerful 300-ship fleet, fell to silence as he turned to the sexual assault scandal. Midshipmen and spectators watching under cool gray skies as a light rain fell listened silently as he repeated the refrain: 'We need your honor.' Obama urged the graduates to use the leadership skills and values learned at the academy to help prevent behavior in the battlefield that can damage the image of the U.S. overseas. 'We need your honor, that inner compass that guides you, not when the path is easy and obvious, but it's hard and uncertain, that tells you the difference between that which is right and that which is wrong,' Obama said. 'Perhaps it will be the moment when you think nobody's watching. But never forget that honor, like character, is what you do when nobody's looking.' Obama's address was the second to a military audience in as many days, coming a day after he laid out his counterterrorism vision at the National Defense University where he defended his controversial drone strikes program and renewed his push to close the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention facility.

"Paul Collingwood will be plotting England's downfall at next year's World Cup after agreeing a return to Scotland's coaching staff. The Durham captain, who is England's most capped one-day player and World Twenty20 winning captain, had previously worked with Scotland as joint interim head coach when they booked their place at the tournament at the start of the year. He was subsequently drafted in by England's then limited-overs coach Ashley Giles to work with the Three Lions at the World T20 in Bangladesh but his role was discontinued when Peter Moores returned as head coach. Former England cricketer Paul Collingwood has joined Scotland's coaching staff ahead of 2015 World Cup . Had Giles got the nod, it is likely that Collingwood, 38, would have gone to the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand in the England camp. But instead he will be trying to help the Saltires pull off a huge upset when the sides meet in Christchurch on February 23. Collingwood said: 'It's a great pleasure for me to be back on the coaching team with the Scotland squad for the 2015 World Cup. 'I'm very much looking forward to working with them to help get the team fully prepared for these incredibly important matches.' Collingwood (centre) guided England to victory at the World Twenty20 in 2010 . Scotland's head coach Grant Bradburn added: 'We are fortunate to once again have the valuable services of Paul Collingwood on board with us for the World Cup. 'Paul will bring a calmness and confidence to our environment and is very familiar with all of our players having been a support coach with Scotland during the World Cup qualifiers in February. 'Having the experience of Paul in our corner will be a huge asset for all of us during this event.'

"Pakistan crushed Australia by 356 runs in the second and final test to complete a 2-0 series victory in Abu Dhabi on Monday. Having set the visitors an impossible 603-run victory target, Pakistan claimed the remaining six wickets in a little over a session on the final day to secure their first test series victory against Australia in 20 years. The win also helped them rise to No 3 in Test rankings. The Pakistan Team celebrate with the trophy after winning the series 2-0 on day five of the second Test .

Smith (97) added 107 runs with Mitchell Marsh in a rare display of Australian resistance in the two-match series before his post-lunch dismissal triggered a collapse with the visitors losing their last five wickets for only eight runs. Zulfiqar Babar (5-120) and Yasir Shah (3-44) once again laid bare the spin frailties of the Australian side who folded for 246 runs in their second innings. Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq was adjudged man-of-the-match for his twin centuries in the test, the second of which equalled Viv Richards' record for the fastest test century in 56 balls. Pakistan's Zulfiqar Babar (left) celebrates after taking the wicket of Australian batsman Nathan Lyon . Australian batsman Steve Smith plays a shot during day day of the second Test . Yasir Shah (right) celebrates after taking the wicket of Smith who went for 97 runs . Run-machine Younus Khan, who hit two centuries and a double hundred in his four innings, was the obvious choice for the man-of-the-series award. Resuming on 143-4, Smith and Marsh (47) frustrated the Pakistani bowlers with a century stand, showing the stomach for fight which was missing in their team mates. Marsh, playing only his second test, proved the perfect foil for Smith, whose decisive footwork against the spinners and positive intent stood out in an otherwise Australian batting capitulation. Marsh, whose 87 was the top score in Australia's first innings, was looking set for his second fifty of the match when the 23-year-old walked into a leg-slip trap. Smith hit Babar for successive boundaries to bring up his eighth test half-century and meted out the same treatment to the spinner in the final over before lunch to cruise into the 90s. Shah denied Smith his fifth test century, trapping him leg before with the second delivery after lunch, which opened the flood gates and Australia collapsed in a heap. Smith hit 12 fours in his 204-ball knock that proved there were no real demons in the dry and dusty pitch at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium. Comprehensively beaten in the first test in Dubai, nothing went right for Australia in the second test either as their batsmen's vulnerability against spin and reverse swing was again on display while their bowlers struggled on a dull pitch. Not a single Australian managed a century in the contest while Misbah and Azhar Ali got hundreds in both innings while Younus struck 213 in the first innings. Australia's bowling limitations were also exposed as they could not bowl out their opponents even once, managing nine wickets in the match while bleeding 863 runs.","Pakistan beat Australia by 356 runs to win second Test and clinch series .

"Mark Ramprakash is to be unveiled as England's new batting coach following the controversial sacking of Graham Gooch earlier this year. The 45-year-old Ramprakash, who earned a reputation during his playing days as a technically impressive batsman who all too rarely fulfilled his potential, will assume his new role in time for England's one-day tour of Sri Lanka later this month. He has been appointed until September 2015. Mark Ramprakash will be England's new batting coach, filling the role of Graham Gooch . Gooch (left), pictured with former coach Andy Flower was sacked as England's batting coach . Ramprakash (left) has already been on England's coaching staff and has helped captain Alastair Cook . He made a positive impression with the England batsmen after being invited to help out in the dressing-room at the start of the 2014 international summer. Having formed a close working relationship with captain Alastair Cook, he will help out in every format. Ramprakash retired in 2012, aged 42, with 114 first class centuries to his name but a Test average of 27 . Ramprakash, who retired in 2012 at the age of 42 with 114 first-class centuries to his name, has said: 'Cook coped magnificently given the tidal wave of criticism. You did wonder if there was an agenda against him.' Now he will be given the chance to cement his popularity within the Peter Moores set-up as England embark on a diet of one-day cricket ahead of the World Cup, which starts in New Zealand on Valentine's Day. Sportsmail understands Ramprakash will not be involved on a full-time basis, as England seek to respond to criticism about their bloated back-room staff. But he will be used at some point in every series. Many had tipped Ramprakash's friend and former team-mate Graham Thorpe to replace Gooch in the role, but Thorpe's reluctance to re-embark on touring life pushed England in Ramprakash's direction. His 11-year international career, which brought him 52 Test caps but only two centuries and an average of 27, often felt symptomatic of an era in which England invariably fell short of expectations. Critics will point out that he managed only a single half-century in 18 one-day internationals – the format that will dominate England's schedule until the Test tour of the Caribbean in April. Ramprakash was technically gifted and brilliant at County level but never quite realised his potential for England . But there is no doubting his long-form credentials and, following his last Test in 2002, Ramprakash played on for another decade at domestic level, establishing himself as the pre-eminent run-maker on the county circuit and rising to national stardom in 2006-07 by winning the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing competition. The occasionally tempestuous youngster who earned himself the nickname 'Bloodaxe' gradually learned to accept his fate. England are now hoping to put his accumulated wisdom to good use. The former cricketer excelled off the field with victory in the 2006/07 series of Strictly Come Dancing .","Mark Ramprakash has been appointed until September 2015 .

"It was a strange feeling at the end of the game. The late tries conceded by Scotland took the slight gloss off what was a great night for Scottish rugby. I had to remind myself that Scotland had just beaten a major team scoring five tries and 41 points. If you had offered me that before the game, I would have snapped your hand off but what the ending did was keep everyone’s feet firmly on the ground. It was a near perfect performance for the first 50 minutes. Not in execution, because there were some mistakes made, but in the way the team set out to play the game. Despite winning the game, Scotland's victory was stained by conceding late tries against Argentina . Vern Cotter had given the players the licence to play and that is exactly what they did. There was a vibrancy about the attack and defence that was so evident and every component of their game functioned very well. There was a lot of confidence in the team before the game, mainly due to the number of Glasgow Warriors players on show and the great start to the season they have had. But it was very obvious that this confidence was spreading to others as Ross Ford and Greig Laidlaw had their best games for Scotland for a long while. In the past year, the Scottish lineout had struggled and part of that was down to Ford’s throwing in with this issue affecting the rest of his game. On Saturday, his throwing in was flawless and his ability to make ground with ball-in-hand were key to the momentum of Scotland’s performance. It was Laidlaw, though, who brought the spark to the team as he added pace and tempo to the game as well as making good decisions. His breaks that created the tries for Sean Maitland and Stuart Hogg were first class and highlighted the sharpness of thought and foot as well as great skill in making the scoring pass. Scotland's Tommy Seymour dives in celebration as he scores their fifth try at the Murrayfield Stadium . Seymour is embraced by team-mates Stuart Hogg (left) and Duncan Weir (right) after scoring his try . The new boys in the team did well. Adam Ashe looks more an international player every time I see him, Finn Russell controlled the game with a composure that belied his years and inexperience, Blair Cowan did well in the tackle area and Rob Harley put in a huge effort as usual. Mark Bennett, on his debut, had a difficult start but settled quickly and will be wiser as a result. He should have had a try on his first cap as Jonny Gray chose to dummy rather than pass to Bennett who was in under the posts. Both players moved on as if nothing had happened which is exactly the right reaction to make. It was some night for the Gray brothers with both scoring but, more importantly, playing so well. They complement each other with Jonny doing a lot of the hard graft and Richie more comfortable in the wider channels. It is incredible to think that, before Grant Gilchrist’s injury, one of these two was not playing. That highlights the strength that Scotland has in the second row. What really impressed me was how ruthless Scotland were in taking their chances. Apart from when Jonny Gray should have passed to Bennett, every time Scotland got in to the Argentina 22, they scored. Six chances and five tries is very clinical indeed and so different to what we are used to see from Scotland. How many times have we had gone through the phases and never looked like scoring? This team has real cutting edge and a desire to win quick ball and make line breaks. It is also a team that prides itself on its defence so the late concession of three tries will give them something to work on this week in training. It was a hugely positive performance and result on Saturday and one that continues the feel-good factor in Scottish rugby. It continued the momentum Glasgow had started and sets us all up for the ultimate test on Saturday, to play the mighty All Blacks. I cannot wait.","Scotland began the game in scintillating fashion but conceded late tries to finish game with a 41-31 win .

"Fred Couples has claimed that the entire defeated US Ryder Cup team at Gleneagles has called on him to be their captain on home soil in 2016. An 11-man ‘taskforce’ was created to find an end to American embarrassment in the competition, with selecting a captain fit for the job foremost on their list of priorities following the post-match mutiny, led by Phil Mickelson, that undermined Tom Watson at Gleneagles.

"A man who suffered devastating burns to much of his body after surviving the deadly 2003 Station nightclub fire has shared his joy at the birth of his baby daughter. Joe Kinan suffered third- and fourth-degree burns and lost his hands, ears and the sight in his left eye in the blaze in West Warwick, Rhode Island, which killed 100 people and injured more than 200. Despite suffering the most extensive injuries of any of the survivors, Kinan, now 45, has fought through 128 surgeries and is now the proud father of a six-month-old girl. He welcomed baby Hadley in April with his fiancee Carrie Pratt, a fellow burns survivor whom he met at a World Burn Congress conference in Vancouver in 2007. Scroll down for video . Joy: Joe Kinan, who suffered third and fourth degree burns across 40 per cent of his body in a deadly nightclub fire in Rhode Island in 2003, shows off his baby daughter, Hadley, with his fiancee, Carrie Pratt, right . 'Carrie has brought everything to my life,' he told People magazine. 'I feel happy, nervous, fulfilled... I'm just determined to be the best dad I can be.' Baby Hadley is Kinan's second child. He also had a 24-year-old daughter, Kate Sullivan, from a relationship before the life-changing blaze. 'I love making her smile,' he said of Hadley. 'She's brought me so much joy.' It's a life far from the emotional and physical pain he suffered in the aftermath of the Station nightclub fire, the fourth deadliest club fire in U.S. history. Kinan was 34 when he went to the West Warwick club on February 20, 2003 with a girlfriend to see a show by the band Great White, who used pyrotechnics in their set. To watch the full episode click here . Before the fire: Kinan, pictured, was 34 when he went to the Station nightclub to watch a band with a friend . Unimaginable: The Station nightclub in West Warwick, Rhode Island burned to the ground in about three minutes after pyrotechnics set curtains alights while band Great White performed. 100 people perished . Within seconds of the show starting, curtains caught fire and, within just five minutes, the entire building had been burned down. A hundred people died and more than 200 were injured as concert-goers desperately tried to escape. Some, like Kinan's friend Karla Bagtaz, suffocated among the crowd. 'It was just this wave of people falling on top of each other,' Kinan recalled, People reported. 'All I saw was black smoke... I was in terrible pain until my skin burned off. Then I had no feeling.' After suffering burns to 40 per cent of his body and nearly losing his scalp, he spent a year in hospital undergoing skin grafts. He lost his fingers, toes and his left eye. Proud: Kinan lost his ears, fingers and left eye to the blaze and in 2012, he underwent a hand transplant, which means he can feel his baby daughter's soft hair, he said. Hadley, left and right, is now six months old . Loving: Pratt, who herself suffered burns to her chest as a child, holds her daughter as Kinan looks on . When he left the hospital, he covered every mirror in his home and refused to go out. But after two years of suffering in seclusion, he decided to look at himself in the mirror. 'These scars couldn't be hidden,' he said. 'I had to accept it, or it was going to eat me up.' He met Pratt, who was badly burned by bad coffee on her chest and neck as a toddler, at the World Burn Congress in Vancouver in 2007. As soon as she met Kinan, she liked him, she said. 'His appearance was no big deal,' she said. 'He had a great outlook. I liked his personality.' The two became friends but slowly their relationship developed to something more.

Family: Kinan is pictured left with his fiancee, while his older daughter Kate cradles her little sister, right . 'I felt safe,' she said. 'He wanted to take care of me. Joe is my rock.' The couple, who live in Lakeville, Massachusetts, became engaged two years ago, on the anniversary of their first meeting. Three days later, he went into surgery to receive a hand transplant - so he can now feel his baby daughter's soft hair, he said.

"Three-time champion Ryan Moore underlined his status as one of the world's best jockeys with a four-length win in Tuesday's Melbourne Cup on German-trained Protectionist. Second was Ed Dunlop's Red Cadeaux, remarkably filling the runners-up spot in Australia's greatest race for a third time in four years. But the race was marred by the death of two runners.

"Ryan Moore confirmed his position as one of the best jockeys in the world by winning the Emirates Melbourne Cup at Flemington aboard German raider Protectionist. Moore came with a turbo-charged late surge inside the final furlong to deny the remarkable Red Cadeaux, finishing second in the Group One handicap for a third time, by four lengths. Trained by Andreas Wohler, Protectionist was a good winner of the Prix Kergorlay, a renowned Melbourne Cup trial in France, in August before finishing an encouraging fourth on his Australian debut at Caulfield on October 11.

Irish challenger Royal Diamond was also prominent in the early stages, as was home favourite Fawkner and big Japanese hope Admire Rakti, who finished last and had to be put down after he collapsed upon his return from the track. The landscape of the race changed markedly around the home turn as the Ed Dunlop-trained Red Cadeaux gained a slight lead two furlongs out and fleetingly looked poised for a famous success at the age of eight.

The splits arrived beautifully as the pace quickened inside the final furlong, which unquestionably played to the strengths of Wohler's inmate, who surged handsomely clear for a decisive triumph. Who Shot Thebarman and Signoff finished third and fourth respectively, while Godolphin's Willing Foe, trained by Saeed bin Suroor, ran a blinder in fifth spot. Moore said: 'He's won very easily, like a very good horse. 'I was struggling for a position early on, but I had so much horse under me. 'I'm very pleased for him (Wohler), his record is very good. 'I've got to thank Michelle (Moore's wife) at home because I've been away a lot. 'You need to win these races for it to be worthwhile. 'It's very special.' Wohler praised Moore's role in the Protectionist fairytale. He said: 'Ryan couldn't have the position that he'd liked to have had, but he was so patient. 'When they came round the last bend he just needed to have the right gap and he found it. Flemington was packed as the Aussies turned out for Melbourne Cup day in their thousands .

Racing Victoria chief steward Terry Bailey said on the TV broadcast that the seven-year-old Japanese stayer collapsed and died shortly after returning to the stalls. Dr Brian Stewart, Racing Victoria's head of veterinary and equine welfare, later issued a statement saying the cause of death has yet to be determined, 'although the circumstances of the horse's passing are very rare' Admire Rakti, owned by Riichi Kondo and trained by Tomoyuki Umeda, carried top weight of 58.5 kilograms (129 pounds) in the fourth-fastest Cup ever run. Stewart said a postmortem examination would be conducted at the University of Melbourne Veterinary Hospital. 'Our sympathies are extended at this time to the owner Mr. Kondo, trainer Mr. Umeda and his staff who cared deeply for their horse and are naturally saddened by their tragic loss,' he said in the statement. Briton Moore tips his cap when swarmed by photographers after the country's biggest race of the year . Jockey Zac Purton said he could tell there was something wrong with his horse early in the race. 'I knew he was in trouble when he didn't tow me into the race around halfway from home,' Purton was quoted as saying by the Australian Broadcasting Corp. 'So I eased him down straight away, the horse's welfare comes first. 'It's very sad. He gave me a great thrill at Caulfield and for this to happen to him is just not fair.' In another post-race incident, seventh-place Araldo broke its leg on the way back to the stalls and had to be euthanized. Racing Victoria said the horse was spooked by a flag waved by a person in the crowd and, in retreating, kicked out and fractured a pastern bone in its hind leg on a fence near the path. Protectionist is now set to continue his racing career in Australia under the tutelage of trainer Kris Lees. Luke Murrell, director of part-owners Australian Bloodstock, said: 'We'll talk to Kris and Andreas, but I think we'd look like giving him a lead-up run before the BMW (in Sydney next year). Asked about Royal Ascot, Murrell said: 'It's a possibility, for sure. There are lots of options.' Dunlop hailed Red Cadeaux, running in the Melbourne Cup for a fourth time, as 'the greatest bridesmaid ever'. The Newmarket handler said: 'He's always susceptible to a younger horse but I'm very proud. 'The way the race was run we were in front plenty soon enough for us and the winner was very good on the day. 'We'll have to come back again, but we'll just see how he is as he's old. 'However, I would like to bring him to Sydney in the autumn. 'He's just been an amazing horse, he must be the greatest bridesmaid ever.' Bin Suroor was especially satisfied with the outcome after his other contender, Cavalryman, was a late defection from the race. Moore was all smiles after getting his hands on the prize for winning the Melbourne Cup . Moore was happy to play up for the photographers after his big win Down Under . He said: 'We understand what happened with Cavalryman, it was up to the vets. 'I'm happy with Willing Foe, he ran a good race and was beaten by a better horse. 'We'll keep him in mile-and-six staying races and, who knows, he could come back.' Seismos, trained by Marco Botti, finished a creditable ninth from a tough draw in stall one. Botti said: 'There was nothing Craig (Williams, jockey) could really do with the draw he had, but he finished the race well.' John Gosden felt Gatewood, who came home in 12th place, did not see out the two-mile trip. Moore salutes the jubilant crowd after running home Protectionist at the lucrative meet Down Under . Moore was the centre of attention during one of his greatest afternoons in the sport . The Clarehaven handler said: 'He ran a great race, he just didn't stay. 'It wasn't the usual Melbourne Cup as My Ambivalent did her own thing from the front. 'He'll come back home now and have a break until the spring.' Despite having shown up promisingly for a long way, the Johnny Murtagh-trained Royal Diamond beat home just two horses. Stablemate Mutual Regard, impressive winner of the Ebor at York in the summer, fared a little better in 14th place, while the headstrong My Ambivalent was 17th. But the day belonged to Moore, who was typically quick to deflect the glory. The jockey said: 'I've just got to thank Andreas, who did a marvellous job bringing this horse all the way down here for a long-term plan. 'He did a top-class job and all I had to do was point him. 'He's a very good horse, he's still improving, and who knows how far he could go.

"FAI chief executive John Delaney has renewed his attack on the ‘unprofessional’ SFA and warned the ticketing row will lead to tensions among rival fans at Celtic Park. Delaney, however, was immediately criticised by Irish supporters, who accused him of trying to stoke up controversy to mask his own failings in the fiasco. Ireland have received an official allocation of 3,209 tickets for Friday’s crunch Euro 2016 qualifier — in line with UEFA’s five per cent minimum. Republic of Ireland CEO John Delaney (right) hit out at the Scottish FA over the handling of tickets . Delaney had demanded more but that was turned down by the SFA, who said there was no room for manoeuvre. Visiting fans will be dotted throughout the Tartan Army on Friday night after acquiring tickets meant for Scots and Delaney now feels there is the potential for trouble. ‘The SFA has really acted unprofessionally here with us,’ he insisted. ‘They only gave us five per cent of the allocation, telling us the game was sold out when it’s not. ‘It means we’re not able to award tickets to hard-core supporters that we would love to accommodate. ‘The mannerly and common-sense thing to have done was give us 7,000 or 8,000 tickets and allow us to allocate them to Irish supporters in the one section. It was also be the safest thing to do; I have to make that point. ‘Scotland are playing well. This is a derby game, it’s a Friday night in Glasgow and there’ll be tension in the air. To have pockets of Irish fans stuck in Scottish areas is not the correct thing to do. ‘In my 10 years as chief executive, no association has treated us as badly as the Scottish have done on this particular occasion.’ Ireland fans are set to be among the home supporters at Celtic Park after receiving a small allocation . However, that standpoint cut little ice with frustrated Irish fans who insist the way the FAI have distributed their allocation is the real issue. A statement from supporters group You Boys In Green said Delaney’s comments were ‘deeply unhelpful and do little more than stoke unnecessary tension’. It added: ‘Both sets of fans have impeccable records for behaviour and have received awards from federations and other bodies for the support of their national sides. We expect both sets of spectators to contribute to a superb atmosphere on Friday night. ‘Once again the chief executive has seen fit to blame the SFA for this saga noting “They only gave us five per cent of the allocation, telling us the game was sold out when it’s not. It means we’re not able to award tickets to hard-core supporters that we would love to accommodate”. ‘YBIG have clearly proved that the FAI system to allocate tickets spectacularly failed, irrespective of the size of the allocation. ‘Many of the hardcore supporters that the chief executive mentions will be sitting with the Scottish supporters are a result of the fact that the FAI have no clear and transparent system in place to allocate tickets. Scotland train ahead of their crunch Euro 2016 qualifier against Ireland . ‘These supporters have acquired “home tickets” for other games due to the same failures in FAI ticketing which occurred here.’ The SFA explained their position last week, stating: ‘Given the demand for tickets from Scotland supporters, and the need to comply with UEFA’s safety and security regulations, we will be unable to increase the Republic of Ireland’s away allocation.’ However, former Republic of Ireland manager Johnny Giles has sided with Delaney and claimed the SFA will have to carry the can if there is any trouble at Parkhead. ‘Anything could happen during the match,’ said Giles. ‘If there is trouble on the night, they will be to blame. And they’ll have to pay the price for that. I can’t understand why the Scottish FA is doing this. ‘Their fans will have to come over here. If the FAI behaved in the same way, the Scottish fans wouldn’t get a fair deal either. We don’t want any of that. But with Irish fans in the Scottish sections, you just don’t know what could happen.’","Ireland were given 3,209 tickets for their qualifier against Scotland .

"It seems that Suge Knight and Katt Williams feel like they were put in jail for no good reason following an incident with a female photographer that happened on September 5 in Los Angeles. Knight and Williams were both arrested Wednesday and charged with felony robbery after a photographer claims the men stole her camera while she was snapping photos of them last month. Now, sources close to Knight are saying the rap mogul was just trying to protect his young son - and that no one ever took the photographer's camera. Scroll down for video . Theft chart: Suge Knight (seen above at a traffic warrant hearing in Las Vegas on Thursday) was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly stealing a female photographer's camera last month . From the scene: Photos from the day of the alleged incident show a woman nursing an injured finger . According to TMZ, Williams' friend confronted the woman when she refused to stop snapping pics of Knight, who is still recovering for injuries sustained when he was shot just two months ago, and his 4-year-old son. She asked the woman to delete the photos on her camera, but she refused. This, however, is where the stories become wildly different. Members of Knight's camp claim, 'the photog is a liar and her camera was NEVER stolen, she had it in her possession when cops came.' Law enforcement sources are saying however, 'Suge orchestrated the entire thing and that Katt was just following his orders.' Though Williams is the one who is actually said to have taken the camera, both are being charged. Also arrested: Comedian Katt Williams, pictured in a previous mug shot from an unrelated case, has also been charged with felony robbery steaming from the alleged scuffle on September 5 in Beverly Hills, California . If found guilty, Suge faces significantly more time than Katt due to a previous assault with a deadly weapon conviction accoriding to the D.A. 'If convicted, Knight, who has a prior conviction for assault with a deadly weapon, faces up to 30 years to life in state prison,' they said. 'Williams faces up to seven years in custody.' Investigations continue: Beverly Hills police are continuing to look into the alleged incident, which reportedly left the woman with 'minor injuries' Both men made bail, with prosecutors asking it to be set at $1 million for the record label founder and $75,000 for the comedian. Photos of the alleged incident show a woman nursing an injured finger, however, neither Katt nor Suge were pictured at the scene. Beverly Hills police Sgt. Max Subin told the LA Times that after coming out of the studio the comedian and hip hop mogul came across the photographer and allegedly chased the woman down an alley. Facing serious time: If convicted, Suge, pictured 2013, faces up to 30 years behind bars . The officer said Kat then grabbed the woman's camera 'forcibly' and she 'sustained minor injuries'. When police arrived on the scene, both of the stars had left, he said. Neither man has been charged with assault. Both Suge - whose real name is Marion - and Katt - real name Micah - have had their fair share of run-ins with police. When he was arrested on Wednesday, Katt was to face court over a July 15 incident in Inglewood when he allegedly pepper-sprayed a man and tried to hit him with his car. The comedian was charged with two counts of felony assault in addition to the use of tear gas. That same month, Los Angeles County sheriffs were called to the Comedy Store in West Hollywood after reports he pulled out a gun and smashed a car window. No charges were laid over that incident. Suge's rap sheet is a little longer, with the 49-year-old first arrested in 1992 on assault and weapons charges for which he received probation. However in 1996, he was arrested after security cameras at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas caught him and a group of other men beating a gang member. He was sentenced to nine years in prison for parole violation. He was imprisoned twice more for violating his parole after being caught consorting with gang members and then assaulting a valet in 2003. Suge has also been the victim of a number of serious crimes - and has been shot three times. Besides getting shot in August, Suge was also injured in 2005, when he was shot in Miami during another pre-awards party. Most famously he was hit by bullet fragments in 1996 in Las Vegas when he was sitting next to rapper Tupac Shakur during a drive-by hit on their car. Tupac did not survive. Tough year: On August 24, the rap mogul was shot six times inside Chris Brown's pre-VMA party at a Hollywood nightclub. It was the third time he had been injured in a shooting .","Suge Knight is facing 30 years to life in prison after being arrested for felony robbery in an incident that happened in Los Angeles on September 5 .

"CLICK HERE to read Chief Sports Writer Martin Samuel's view on Ched Evans' bid to return to football... Convicted rapist Ched Evans has pleaded for a second chance in football - and has even claimed he can be 'positive for a club and community'. Evans, who was freed from prison last Friday after serving two-and-a-half years, has released a video statement in his quest to find a new club. The Wales striker - who could be offered a way back by former club Sheffield United - appeared alongside his girlfriend Natasha Massey in the video posted on his official website. VIDEO Scroll down to hear Ched Evans' statement defending himself . Ched Evans (left) has released a video statement pleading for a second chance back in football . Evans was convicted of raping a 19-year-old girl in April 2012, serving two-and-a-half years in prison . The 25-year-old apologised to his partner Natasha Massey (right) for cheating on her with his victim at the time . Club career . Manchester City (2007-09) - one goal in 16 appearances .

Wearing a black shirt and tie and reading from an autocue, Evans, 25, said: 'I made an incredibly foolish decision and failed those people who trusted and believed in me - most of all Tasha and our families. 'It is a rare and extraordinary privilege to be permitted to play professional football. 'Now that I have served the custodial part of my sentence of two-and-a-half years it is my hope that I will be able to return to football. If that is possible then I will do so with humility, having learned a very painful lesson. 'I would like a second chance but I know that not everyone will agree. I don't believe I have a given right to play again but for any club to take me on, I have learned a valuable lesson and know that all the time I can prove myself to be a positive influence - not just on the pitch, but also in the community.' Evans is unrepentant in the 1min 45sec long video message and says he is determined to 'clear my name' and show that sex with his victim was 'consensual'. Evans' last club was  League One outfit Sheffield United before his imprisonment . Evans scored 42 goals in 103 appearances for the Blades during three seasons at the club . The former Wales international (left) represented his country 13 times, scoring once . 'Even though I have been released from prison I am determined to continue the fight to clear my name and it is public knowledge that an application to refer my case back to the Court of Appeal has recently been submitted to the Criminal Case Review Commission by my lawyers. The application seeks to demonstrate that the act I engaged in on that night was consensual in nature and not rape.' That is the only mention of the word rape, although Evans does call what he did 'a destructive act'. He is more concerned, however, with how it affected his relationship with his partner - who he thanks for standing by him - and not how it has impacted upon his victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons. 'In May 2011, at a hotel in Wales, by cheating on my partner Natasha I hurt the woman I love with all my heart. Since that night I have constantly regretted my act of infidelity and the damage that has been done on so many fronts because of it. 'The support that has been shown by Natasha, our friends and family during the trial and the time spent in prison has kept me strong. It can't have been an easy thing to have stuck by someone who the court found guilty of such a destructive act - I will be forever grateful.' Evans ends the message by saying: 'Thank you for listening to me'. United fans displayed a banner in support of convicted rapist Evans during the 2-0 win at Bradford on Saturday .

"In four minutes of playing time against Aston Villa, Andy Carroll contributed more to the excitement of a goalless draw than almost anyone else. It took roughly the same amount of time for Sam Allardyce to explain he will take personal responsibility if this comeback is rushed and ends in yet more pain for the striker. It’s been easy to forget over the five months since Carroll  tore ligaments in his left ankle — and West Ham found an exciting attack pair in his absence — that he can cause mayhem with correct service. Andy Carroll was all smiles as he returned to the West Ham United bench for the first time this season alongside Kevin Nolan (left) Carroll replaces team-mate Mark Noble for West Ham to make his first appearance of the season . Stewart Downing provided that on Saturday as Carroll made his first appearance since a pre-season tour of New Zealand ended with a flight to the US for surgery. His cameo was brief but dramatic as he dominated Villa in the air. A draw breaks Villa’s streak of six defeats, yielding their first point since September 13. The challenge now will be his slow reintegration, with Allardyce estimating it could be as many as six games before the 25-year-old is fully fit. ‘Andy is five or six games away from being fit,’ Allardyce said. ‘He is in the (equivalent of) first throes of pre-season. ‘It will take strength of mind as we must not think he is ready now, which he will do because all players do. The towering forward gets up highest to fire in a header at the Villa goal towards the closing stages of the game . West Ham boss Sam Allardyce will not be rushing Carroll back after a quicker than expected recovery . 'It is me having a firm sense of mind by saying, “You are in pre-season, if I bring you on any quicker and you get injured again then that will be my fault”. ‘I am not willing to do that because the squad we have is working fantastically well.’ Allardyce provided a compelling insight into the battle Carroll has endured since suffering his second major injury in just 18 months. He said: ‘I remember him in New Zealand, really distressed, and then flying to Boston to get the repair. ‘That decision was made swiftly so Andy had the op in a few days and he is probably back sooner than expected.","West Ham extended their five-match unbeaten run with a 0-0 draw against Aston Villa on Saturday .

"English football should set a target of at least 20 per cent of professional coaches being from black and ethnic minority (BME) backgrounds by 2020, according to a new report. The report, carried out by the Sports People's Think Tank (SPTT), has revealed BME coaches fill only 3.4 per cent of positions in England, despite making up 25 per cent of professional players. Figures also show 19 out of the 552 senior coaching positions at England's 92 league clubs are currently held by coaches from BME backgrounds, who make up just 6.4 per cent of those with the FA UEFA Pro Licence - England's top coaching qualification. Jason Roberts, pictured outside Downing Street (left) and playing for Reading during his career, is a founding member of the think tank Football Against Racism in Europe who have funded the research . The research, funded by Football Against Racism in Europe (The Fare Network), points to 'institutional discrimination' and is urging governing bodies to set 'an overall target of at least 20 per cent of coaches in professional football be from BME backgrounds by 2020'. Former Reading, Blackburn and Wigan striker Jason Roberts, who is a founding member of the think tank, told a meeting with MPs on Monday: 'I'm confident this report will increase the pressure because this debate has been going on a long time. 'Ten years ago we had three black managers, this season we had no black managers so it's not a matter of time. 'There's a hidden resistance in football stopping managers coming through.' Roberts added in the report: 'It appears that football has lost successive generations of potential coaches and managers simply because they are black or from other ethnic minority backgrounds. 'The numbers do not add up, so many players from our communities who have achieved so much on the field of play - distinguished careers as senior players in some of the biggest clubs in this country, many with international caps, some who played at major tournaments - yet so few that have been given opportunities to achieve as coaches. 'Talk to these individuals about the realities they faced, the number of jobs they applied for, the number of interviews they had, and the feeling emerges that they have been the victims of a systematic denial of talent and ambition.' Keith Curles is one of the 3.4 per cent of black and ethnic minority (BME) coaches employed in England . To boost the number of BME coaches in English football, SPTT recommends a 'positive action scheme' similar to that used in America's National Football League, which makes it compulsory for employers to interview minority candidates. It also put forward plans for networking events aimed at extinguishing an 'insider culture' where jobs are handed out based on 'who you know, not what you know'. Loughborough University's Dr Stephen Bradbury, who carried out the report, concluded: 'Taken together, these findings highlight the limited transition of BME players into coaching and leadership positions in English professional football and the overwhelmingly White landscape of the senior decision making tiers of the sport.' PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor attended the meeting in Westminster along with several football figures, including QPR head of football operations Les Ferdinand and former Tottenham first-team coach Chris Ramsey, who now works with QPR's academy. Taylor said: 'Nowhere can the global village be seen better than on a football field but there is a stage two - an average playing career is only eight years. 'There is a clear, blatant and obvious piece of the jigsaw missing with regard to management and coaches. More than 25 per cent of players are from BME background, including Sammy Ameobi and Wayne Routledge . 'People always say why you can't do things but we can because any sane and right-minded person would know it is a natural follow-through. 'You can have top-class black managers the same as you can have top-class black players. That's what this campaign is about. 'It's not just an opinion now - it's an argument based on facts, reason and logic.' The Football Association's Inclusion Advisory Board chair Heather Rabbatts said the governing body welcomed the report. 'It adds further evidence that bodies across the game need to work together to challenge discrimination,' she said in a statement on the FA website. 'This report underlines why we all need to continue to work together, to address the lack of BAME representation beyond the pitch and the 'closed systems' which maintain it. 'At The FA, we are committed to the long term programme of change from working with the PFA on preparing ex-players for the boardroom with the On Board programme, to developing our coach educator workforce from BAME backgrounds and introducing new mentoring opportunities for BAME coaches with the England development teams. 'We look forward to discussing these ideas with the FARE network and the Sports People's Think Tank and also working with the sports minister to bring all parties together to maintain the momentum of change and build, on the work already under way across the game.'","Sports People's Think Tank (SPTT) have carried out report on coaches .

"Stuart McCall quit as Motherwell boss - two weeks after being talked out of leaving by his employers. The second-longest serving manager in Scottish senior football was, Sportsmail understands, ready to walk after losing 3-1 at home to Dundee a fortnight ago. Convinced to stay on in the hope of turning around a horrific early-season run of form, McCall ultimately had his spirit broken by successive away defeats to Aberdeen and St Johnstone. Stuart McCall has resigned as Motherwell boss having been convinced to stay on just two weeks ago . Motherwell players hold their heads in their hands as they succumb to another defeat on Friday . With his team sitting second bottom of the Premiership and worried that his own darkening mood had become a drag on the squad’s spirit, 50-year-old McCall - described by Motherwell directors as one of the most successful managers in their history - broke the news of his decision to club officials following a youth game against Celtic at Greenock on Sunday. Despite further attempts to talk him round, the former Scotland and Rangers star insisted that it was time to move on. Board member Derek Weir insisted that the directors had been willing to stand by a coach who had regularly over-achieved on a shoestring budget, finishing second in the top flight in consecutive seasons. ‘We have been acutely aware of results this season - but everyone at Fir Park was confident in his and the team’s ability to turn things around,’ said Weir. ‘However, following a long conversation this afternoon, Stuart felt it was better for all concerned if he stepped down with immediate effect and we respect that.’ McCall, pictured after the 1-1 draw with Celtic in September, believed he could no longer take the club forward . Sportsmail understands that there was no pressure from within the club on McCall, whose record of success had made him as close to fireproof as it’s possible for any manager to be. But the man himself felt that he was running out of enthusiasm for the job, fearing that he couldn’t get any more out of the group - and confessed to friends that he was beginning to dread matchday. He was willing to hang on even after that Dundee loss, however, because he felt he owed the club his best effort to improve. Last Friday night’s 2-1 defeat to St Johnstone at McDiarmid Park appears to have been the last straw. An official club statement released last night heaped praise on the departing head coach, saying: ‘Motherwell FC can announce Stuart McCall has resigned from his position as manager. McCall was the second longest-serving manager in Scottish football before his resignation on Sunday . ‘McCall , who was appointed in December 2010 and was the second longest serving manager in Scottish senior football (after Forfar bos s Dick Campbell) informed the board of his decision late this afternoon. ‘The 40-times capped former Scotland midfielder has overseen a period of incredible success at Fir Park, including taking Motherwell into the Scottish Cup Final in 2011, then three ‘Best of the Rest’ finishes in the Scottish top flight. ‘As manager, he smashed a number of long-standing records, including for games won, goals scored, clean sheets and points accumulated; the 50-year old also led Motherwell into the UEFA Champions League for the first and only time back in 2012. ‘In contrast, the current season hasn’t started as well as anyone would like.’ Weir, who was instrumental in McCall’s appointment almost four years ago, confirmed that assistant manager Kenny Black will act as caretaker until a new manager is found. He added: ‘Everyone at Motherwell FC would like to sincerely thank Stuart for his contribution to the club, which will go down as one of the most successful managerial tenures in our 128-year history.’ St Johnstone's victory over Motherwell on Friday proved to be the final straw for long-serving McCall . There are echoes of McCall’s resignation from Bradford City in 2010, when he stepped down under very little pressure from the board - arguing that he couldn’t take the team any further. Under his guidance, Motherwell regularly left clubs with bigger finances trailing - as well as turning Michael Higdon into Scotland’s Player of the Year. Each summer brought fresh cuts to his budget, however, and McCall spent almost every close season bidding farewell to the previous campaign’s best performers. He has become a valued member of Gordon Strachan’s Scotland staff since his appointment, on a part-time basis, in January 2013. Bookies immediately installed former Ross County boss Derek Adams as favourite for the Fir Park job, followed by Terry Butcher, Gary Locke, Ian Murray, Owen Coyle and Jimmy Calderwood.","Stuart McCall resigned as Motherwell manager on Sunday .

"Paddy McNair has been backed to make an impression for Northern Ireland and Manchester United by former winger Keith Gillespie. The 19-year-old defender from Ballyclare has enjoyed a rapid ascent having made his United debut against West Ham in September after just 11 under-21s appearances. Gillespie, who believes Northern Ireland have a strong chance of automatic qualification for Euro 2016, hopes McNair seizes his opportunity after being called into Michael O'Neill's squad for the first time for Friday's clash in Romania. Manchester United teenager Paddy McNair has been given his first call up by Northern Ireland . The 19-year-old has been drafted in to United's first team following a spate of defensive injuries . Gillespie, who was speaking at the filming of the new Vauxhall Home Nations Football Show, said: 'He's still very young, still has a lot to learn, but he's done himself no harm in the (United) games that he's played so far. 'They've had injuries at the back and he's taken his chance. 'They've probably looked more solid in the games he's played than they have in the other games when they've been conceding goals. 'He's done very well. There's an opportunity for him there if he continues to progress the way he is.' McNair's rise has, in part, been a result of Jonny Evans' ankle injury. But Gillespie believes O'Neill will find a way to accommodate Evans when the defender is fit. Former Manchester United and Northern Ireland winger Keith Gillespie tackles Wayne Rooney in 2005 . United's Jonny Evans is currently sidelined with injury but will likely have a place on his international return . The 39-year-old, who won 86 caps in a career which began at Old Trafford, added: 'He's a very important player for us. He'll find a position for Jonny somewhere, whether he plays left-back or goes three at the back.' Northern Ireland have already beaten Hungary and Greece to top Group F by two points from Romania ahead of this week's Bucharest clash. Gillespie is optimistic for the qualification campaign. He said: 'When the draw was made I thought we could sneak third place; now I feel as if we could definitely get one of those top two places (and automatic qualification). 'We're in an ideal position, three wins out of three. One thing that's really helped us is three of our first four games are away and they're our hardest games. 'To win our first three games has been an incredible start - Greece away, Hungary away. 'We're capable of beating anyone at home, so I really think we've a great chance.

"Brave: The Queen still managed to  smile despite being forced to visit BBC  Broadcasting House without her beloved husband Prince Philip, who is in hospital nearby . The Queen robustly insisted the Duke of Edinburgh was ‘not ill’ yesterday. Her comments, during a tour of the BBC’s new Broadcasting House, came as her husband underwent exploratory surgery on his abdomen. Last night he was said to be making ‘satisfactory progress’ following the operation under general anaesthetic. During a visit to the BBC’s new HQ, the Queen was asked by radio and TV host John Humphrys how Prince Philip was faring, She replied: ‘I have no idea, I mean he has only just gone in.’ When the Radio 4 presenter persisted, saying the Duke had looked well during his appearance at a Buckingham Palace garden party on Thursday just hours before his admission, the monarch remarked pithily: ‘That’s because he’s not ill.’ Buckingham Palace confirmed in a statement last night that the surgery had been successfully completed and the results would now be analysed. They appeared cautiously optimistic about his recovery, saying that ‘at this early stage he is progressing satisfactorily’. Such caution is understandable given Philip’s age and the fact that this is the fourth time he has been hospitalised in the last 18 months. Scroll down for videos . Shrugged off: The Queen today told John Humphrys that her husband was 'not ill' after the broadcaster asked about his health . Experts said the recovery could take . as long as two or three months meaning it could be a long time before . the Duke is able to restart his public engagements. Minutes before the Palace statement . was released, however, the Queen’s physician, Professor John Cunningham, . was seen leaving the hospital apparently in good spirits. The statement read: ‘His Royal . Highness The Duke of Edinburgh has had an exploratory operation . following abdominal investigations. The results will now be analysed. At . this early stage he is progressing satisfactorily. Further updates will . continue to be issued when appropriate.’ Newsflash: Presenters Julian Worricker and Sophie Long turn round to find the Queen has turned up during one their bulletins .

Pensive: The Queen on a visit to the BBC yesterday, as Prince Philip underwent abdominal surgery . The Queen will spend the weekend at . Windsor Castle as usual. She is said to be ‘concerned’ and being kept . fully informed of her husband’s progress. Peter Phillips, the Duke’s eldest . grandson, said the family were being informed about his grandfather’s . progress, and he would not want them to stop going about their daily . business. He told BBC News: ‘Obviously our . thoughts and prayers are with him, we know that he’s in good hands and . we’ve been kept up to date in terms of what’s happening. 'But he’s one of . those people who wouldn’t want you to stop just because he’s gone into . hospital.’ Philip, who turns 92 on Monday, is set . to remain at The London Clinic in Harley Street for up to two weeks . following the surgery. Details about his condition or the . original symptoms that prompted doctors to recommend the exploratory . operation have not been released by Buckingham Palace. But sources have confirmed that he . underwent tests last week and was advised that further medical . intervention would be necessary. Aides have insisted he is in ‘good spirits’ and had walked into the hospital unaided after being driven there by car. Chat: She spoke to lead singer  Danny O'Donoghue of The Script, and they briefly discussed Glastonbury, with her Majesty saying he should be careful of the mud . Stars: Strictly Come Dancing presenter Tess Daley was joined by Doctor Who actress Jenna-Louise Coleman also came to Portland Place in Central London to see Her Majesty .

At work: Presenters Claudia Winkleman and Alex Jones were at Broadcasting House while Claudia then bumped into presenter Stacey Dooley shortly afterwards . Performance: Danny O'Donoghue and his band The Script sang the David Bowie song Heroes for Her Majesty . They also suggested that the Duke was . not suffering from any discomfort and had arranged to have the operation . after doctors ‘picked something up’ during a routine health check over . the past week. But Mr John Moorehead, vice president . of the Association of Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland, said last . night it was ‘uncommon’ for someone of the Duke of Edinburgh’s age to . have an exploratory surgical procedure. Regardless of how fit the Duke might appear to be, surgery at his age carried much greater risks, he said. ‘The reason for that is regardless of . how fit and well someone might appear to be, when you get to that age . there’s a much increased risk of having other medical problems,’ he . said. ‘As you get older you are more likely to have other things wrong which could complicate things during surgery. Mr Moorehead also suggested a two-week stay in hospital ‘is longer than would be expected’ if the procedure was simply routine. He added: ‘If it’s something very . trivial he might be out of commission for three or four weeks or if it’s . more serious, you could be talking about a recovery period of two or . three months.’ Prince Philip has cancelled two . engagements over the past week – a lecture at Windsor Castle and a . reception at Buckingham Palace – but aides said this was not due to his . abdominal pain. Royal arrival: Crowds turned out to greet Her Majesty as she arrived at Broadcasting House, five minutes away from where Prince Philip is in hospital . Pleased to see her: Flag-waving crowds turned out to wish Her Majesty well as she came to visit the BBC's £1bn home . Goodbye: Her Majesty smiles and waves to the crowds outside Broadcasting House as she heads back to the Palace . Together: Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip arrive to attend a garden party yesterday at the Palace . Guards: Police stand outside The London Clinic this morning, where Prince Philip has been brought for an operation . With a two week stay, it's likely the Duke Of Edinburgh will undergo a series of tests. GP Dr Arun Ghosh told MailOnline last night that an exploratory operation of the abdomen would usually suggest a laparoscopy - keyhole surgery to access and examine the inside of the abdomen and pelvis. This provides a much more detailed view of what is going on inside the body than techniques such as ultrasound. A laparoscopy is not used to diagnose cancer.The procedure is often used to investigate what appears to be an obstruction, most commonly a twisted bowel, where the natural shape of the intestines has changed or a section of the intestines has overlapped. The Duke of Edinburgh's latest bout of ill health comes after a series of recent health complications. He was taken into hospital in Aberdeen in August after being admitted with a recurrence of the bladder infection he suffered in June. The Duke spent almost a week in the King Edward VII Hospital in London after falling ill with the infection during the Diamond Jubilee. It was the third time in nine months the Duke has been in hospital. In 2011, he spent Christmas at Papworth Hospital in Cambridge after suffering chest pains at the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk. He underwent surgery for a blocked coronary artery, for which he had a stent fitted. General aesthetics can cause serious side-effects and the risks are far higher in elderly patients. At worst they include cardiac arrest, breathing problems and brain damage - but these are very rare and less serious complications include nausea, headaches and temporary confusion. A royal source told the Mail: ‘The Duke underwent abdominal tests last week and was told a few days ago that he needed to have an exploratory operation. ‘He has been feeling under the weather in recent days but that is because he had lost his voice. The two are quite unconnected. ‘He was admitted to hospital by arrangement and left quite calmly – and without any panic – after today’s garden party, where he was on top form.’ The situation prompts further questions about the Duke of Edinburgh’s workload and that of the Queen. A few weeks ago, Buckingham Palace . announced the pair would be scaling back on their long-haul foreign . travel, leaving it largely to younger royals. The Mail also revealed that high-level . talks had been taking place between Buckingham Palace, Clarence House . and Downing Street for Prince Charles to take an even more prominent . role. It will also put pressure on the Duke . and Duchess of Cambridge – who are expecting their first baby – to . become full-time working royals. Prince William is due to leave his . role as an RAF search and rescue pilot in September and is expected . within weeks to announce what he intends to do next. He had been . expected to take up a further military post that would give him more . opportunity to undertake royal engagements. However pressure is now sure . to mount on him to leave the forces completely and take the strain off . his elderly grandparents. The Duke’s admittance to the clinic . comes almost a year to the day that he was hospitalised with a serious . bladder infection during the diamond jubilee celebrations. At yesterday’s garden party, the Queen . and Prince Philip appeared together on the steps of the palace at 4pm, . when the national anthem was played. Despite the fierce sun, with . temperatures of around 22C (72F), the Duke appeared relaxed and happily . chatted to guests as he walked around the garden. Lord Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire Sir . John Peace was introduced to the Queen and the duke as they made their . way through the gardens. He said: ‘It was wonderful to see the Duke of . Edinburgh with her.’ Sir John said the prince had been ‘telling jokes’ – . but would not divulge what they were about. All smiles: The Queen presents the Duke with New Zealand's highest honour, the Order of New Zealand, in the presence of Sir Lockwood Smith, High Commissioner for New Zealand, at Buckingham Palace yesterday .

"A love-struck graphic designer has been cleared of trying to kill her mother by poisoning her after she forbade her from marrying her boyfriend. Inspired by a storyline in Breaking Bad, Kuntal Patel, 37, was accused of slipping her 'controlling and selfish' mother Meena a ricin-like toxin. It was alleged that Patel developed a murder plot after becoming 'addicted' to the American TV series and watching an episode in which drug lord Walter White kills an enemy with ricin-laced tea. But while Patel, a volunteer at the London Olympics, admitted fantasising about killing her magistrate mother, who the court heard was 'hell-bent' on breaking up her engagement and bullied and beat her, she denied ever intending to kill her. 'Plot': Kuntal Patel, 37, (left), from east London, has been cleared of trying to kill her mother Meena Patel, 60, (right) by lacing her Diet Coke with a deadly poison in a Breaking Bad-style plot . Jurors at Southwark Crown Court heard from prosecutors that Patel (pictured in a court sketch) fantasised about being Walter White, the main character in Breaking Bad, or a Mexican warlord . She told jurors that she became suicidal and scoured the 'dark web' looking for poisons. She admitted trying to buy the deadly toxin abrin from American Jesse Korff, telling him she needed a 'tasteless' toxin to get her mother 'out of the way'. The jury of six men and six women, which had deliberated for just over three hours, cleared her of attempted murder, but convicted of acquiring a biological agent or toxin. She had previously pleaded guilty to two counts of attempting to acquire a biological agent or toxin. But she said emails sent to her dealer claiming she had poisoned her mother were a 'fabrication' She showed little emotion as the verdict was given. She was remanded back into custody and will be sentenced on November 7. The Barclays Bank graphic designer said the comments were part of a wild fantasy world in which she imagined herself as Walter White or a 'Mexican drug warlord'. She wept in the witness box as she insisted she never actually poisoned her mother. She told jurors: 'By this time, because of the messages I received from my mum, and because I couldn't cope with it and I wanted to escape from it all, I started to fantasise about trying to kill myself or my mum. 'It was as if I was thinking through it as if I was in my own TV programme or a character in Breaking Bad. I was in a really strange place in my mind.' She added: 'But I was living this other life. This was my own way of coping - it was my coping mechanism. It was how I survived daily.' Patel also told the court how she had to ‘respect and obey’ her mother, who was described by the prosecution as ‘manipulative, controlling and selfish’ Asked if she, as ‘an adult woman’, she found her domestic situation normal, Patel replied: ‘I think it was the way I was brought up’. The two-week trial heard that Patel, who was brought up a strict Hindu Gujarati, had never had a boyfriend or a Valentine's Day card, and was desperate to settle down and have children. She struck up a relationship with Niraj Kakad, who lived in Phoenix, Arizona, on the Asian dating website Shaadi.com and the pair got engaged on Thanksgiving in November 2012. But she said her mother was 'hell-bent' on breaking up her relationship, and is said to have locked Patel in their home, and beaten and bullied her in a bid to get her to stop seeing Mr Kakad. The court heard how the wedding venue became a constant bone of contention and Mr Kakad felt Meena was suffocating his wife-to-be. He once told the mother she was ‘a low-level magistrate dealing with low-level crimes’. On another occasion, Meena rang Mr Kakad the early hours of the morning, crying and demanding to know if he really loved her daughter. Niraj Kakad, 36, was born in London but moved to Arizona as a child. Of Gujarati heritage, he has a successful, high-earning career in IT but had been unlucky in love and was desperate to get married. He and Kuntal Patel fell deeply in love and quickly agreed to marry after meeting online, but their ‘on/off on/off’ engagement quickly hit the rocks. The court heard how Mr Kakad could not cope with Meena Patel’s incessant interference in his relationship, grossly offending her when he accused her of ‘controlling’ behaviour. When Kuntal told her mother what Mr Kakad had said this, she is said to have slapped her daughter repeatedly. The family were also shocked when he reported that UK-based friends had warned him off ‘East London girls’. He has since cut off all contact with Kuntal Patel and is planning to sell the Tiffany jewellery he bought for his wife-to-be. Kuntal travelled to America to see Mr Kakad twice during their ‘on/off on/off’ relationship, and the Patel’s hosted him in once in London. Their relationship buckled under the pressure, and they broke up. Driven to despair, Patel told how she slumped into a depression and began searching ways of killing herself on the internet. In a series of increasingly desperate emails and texts, she confided in her friend about the 'relentless' abuse and violence she allegedly suffered at the hands of her mother, who sits on the bench at Thames Magistrates' Court. In one message in August 2012, she said: 'My life is so messed up right now, I actually wish I was dead or wish my mum died. I hate her so much.' Asked why she focused on Ricin, she replied: ‘It was from the internet and partly due to the programme Breaking Bad.’ Patel became ‘addicted’ to the programme and watched an episode every day until she completed the series, the court heard. Simultaneously, she was Googling ‘How to murder somebody and get away with it’ and ‘hit man’, while researching the poisons Ricin, Abrin and Arsenic. Patel, of Plaistow in east London, admitted paying Korff, who used the internet name 'Snowman', £950 in the virtual currency bitcoins for abrin. The poison was allegedly hidden in a red wax candle and delivered to London, but Patel said she 'panicked' when she picked the package up and threw it away. Patel was arrested after the FBI and Homeland Security tipped off the Metropolitan Police that abrin had been shipped to an address in London. A spokesman from Scotland Yard said: 'The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) contacted the Metropolitan Police Service with information that abrin had been shipped to a London address. 'On Saturday, January 25, officers executed a search warrant at a residential address in Stratford and arrested Patel on suspicion of an offence under the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001. Role: Meena Patel is a  magistrate at Thames Magistrates' Court in Bow, east London . 'Detectives from SO15 Counter Terrorism Command were able to uncover and decrypt web-based conversations between Patel and the abrin supplier in the US.' Before her trial Patel had pleaded guilty to two counts of attempting to acquire a biological agent or toxin, contrary to section 1(1) of the Criminal Attempts Act 1981. The spokesman added: 'On August 12 Jesse William Korff, 19, of LaBelle, Florida, pleaded guilty before US District Judge Peter G. Sheridan in Trenton federal court to five counts of developing, producing, transferring and possessing toxins, five counts of smuggling toxins and one count of conspiring to kill a person in a foreign country. 'He is due to be sentenced in November.' Duncan Ball of Counter Terrorism Command said: 'Our thorough and complex investigation identified that Kuntal Patel had purchased an extremely deadly toxin via the dark web. 'I would like to pass on my personal thanks to US law enforcement and other international agencies for their co-operation and assistance during this investigation.'
