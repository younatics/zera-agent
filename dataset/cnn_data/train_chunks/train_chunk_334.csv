"(CNN) -- With owners ranging from onetime Presidents of the United States through Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Makhtoum to the Queen of England herself, horse racing is known as the 'Sport of Kings' for good reason. If you're going to be a player, you're likely to need near-limitless funds. Occasionally though, a relative pauper does manage to gatecrash the party every once in a while. Take Dave Dillon, who works as a hotel controller in Chicago -- and who's absolutely convinced of one thing. ""I make no bones about the being the luckiest guy alive,"" he volunteered within seconds of speaking to CNN. It's a big call that only seems more fanciful when you learn that Dillon, 59, has been granted a long-term medical leave of absence following surgery to treat prostate cancer. Having bought into some 25-30 horses over the years, too many of which suffered from a case of the 'slows' -- as he laughingly puts it -- Dillon made a $5,000 transaction that would change his life. Five years and $700,000 later, the expectation is that there's plenty more to come. For when Dillon chose to buy 5% of a horse that nobody had wanted at a sales auction just weeks earlier, he bought a yearling that would not only win the most famous race in the United States -- the Kentucky Derby -- but also the world's richest race -- the $10m Dubai World Cup. ""When Animal Kingdom went through sales in 2009, no one bid on him so they brought him back and re-syndicated him. Team Valor -- the partnership that owned Animal Kingdom -- syndicated him for $100,000 and I bought 5%,"" Dillon expands. ""On the racetrack, he earned $8.8m."" The numbers are as extraordinary as Animal Kingdom's supreme career, which sparkled so brightly Dillon could well receive another $1m in stud fees. In late 2012, 75% of Animal Kingdom was sold to an Australian stud farm called Arrowfield, which was chosen for its proven track record and because the deal allowed the horse's investors to remain involved. Three months later, the champion horse won the Dubai World Cup -- with the success swiftly prompting Sheikh Mohammed, whose entry had been beaten by Animal Kingdom, to come on board. His U.S.-based stud farm Darley bought a 29% stake in Animal Kingdom, with Arrowfield owning 51%, leaving Team Valor with the remaining 20%. The figures are important because even though Dillon now owns just 1% of Animal Kingdom, this slender stake should still be enough to ensure a pampered retirement. ""There is no way you can explain how surreal this whole adventure has been, because we haven't made the real money yet,"" he said. ""His stud fee in Australia is $35,000 and he was recently mated to around 100 mares there. ""At the end of the southern hemisphere season, he was shuttled to Kentucky and is currently in the middle of his first season there. ""His American stud fee is $35,000 and it appears his Kentucky season will show him bred to 145 mares. ""So he'll generate between $7-9m in stud fees if he's successful but you won't know that until the first crop race. Then it could go up or down. But the fact he could generate $8-9m in fees for 10- to 15 years is the most amazing part for me."" Which means Dillon could make a return in excess of 30,000% on his investment. ""One of the rules of investing is finding the smartest guy in any industry and grabbing onto their coattails,"" said Dillon, explaining his decision to invest in Animal Kingdom. ""This success is all about Barry Irwin, the chairman of Team Valor, and I like to think the only smart thing I did was grab onto his coattails and hang on."" As with many racehorses, Animal Kingdom's ownership was shared among a syndicate or, as it's more commonly known in the U.S., a partnership. The practice allows several investors to own a share of a horse for an affordable price, one that also enables them to feel like owners as they attend a race day. The costs can vary greatly -- from as little as $140 in the United Kingdom to take part in an sizable syndicate of 100-odd investors to far heftier fees that start with a minimum investment of $42,000. ""There are various ways that people come into racing, and syndicates are a good way of testing the water,"" James Bethell, who runs the small Clarendon Thoroughbred Racing syndicate in northern England, told CNN. ""Investors don't have to make a great outlay, and they soon get a feel about whether they want to go any further."" Dillon says his good fortune was to invest with Team Valor but he's being modest, for he researched intensely before gambling on a man who also knew about leaps of faith. In 1969, Team Valor chairman Irwin gave up a fiction writing career to work as a horseracing journalist and broadcaster -- a role he exploited to the full. ""I drove a lot of famous people nuts, asking them questions,"" he says on Team Valor's website. ""But there were things I wanted to know and I was in a perfect place to pester racing's greats for answers."" Nine years in, he used his acquired knowledge to become a bloodstock agent before then switching to operating a stable of syndicated racehorses in 1987. As a result of addressing conventional wisdom with a sledgehammer, Irwin's reward has been a glut of glittering trophies. ""What separates me from other people is that I only care about how the horses look and move -- namely, studying their athleticism and body,"" he told CNN. ""Most people are hung up on pedigree but when I started out, I didn't have that much money so that's why we adopted our strategy."" So Irwin relegated the importance of a horse's lineage (pedigree) below talent, athleticism, soundness and temperament, and the results have been spectacular. Team Valor horses have won at least 25 Grade 1 races around the world, but Irwin feels Animal Kingdom defines his approach. ""He had a Brazilian sire, which nobody previously cared about, and a German mare. I went for it and bought both, did the mating and breeding, and thankfully it worked out,"" he said. ""When I buy a horse, I'm looking for a particular style that will be effective. And I'll tell you something I won't expand upon -- American racing is not about class, but about racing style and speed."" Despite the gains he has made by largely ignoring pedigree, Irwin says he doesn't see anyone copying his approach. So it's ironic that Team Valor's contrary policy will be further rewarded as wannabe Grade 1 winners queue up to pay a small fortune for an Animal Kingdom foal. All in the hope of sharing the parade rings and winners' enclosures with some of the world's most powerful people -- a holy grail Dillon is still wholly surprised to be part of.","How investor's $5,000 stake in a horse will return well over a million dollars .

"(CNN) -- Jacqueline Mars, a co-owner of the candy empire of the same name, was involved in a car crash Friday near her home in Northern Virginia that killed an 86-year-old woman. Mars was driving alone in her 2004 Porsche SUV when ""for unknown reasons the vehicle crossed the center line and struck an eastbound 2013 Chrysler minivan occupied by six people,"" according to the Loudoun County Sheriff's Office. One of those six people, Irene Ellisor of Huntsville, Texas, died at the scene. Authorities say she was not wearing her seat belt. Mars, 73, was hospitalized for her injuries and is now recuperating at home, according to her personal spokesman. ""This tragedy has left Jacquie filled with sorrow for the loss of life and those who were injured in the accident,"" said Kent Jarrell, who is not affiliated with Mars, Inc. ""She would like to express her deepest condolences to the families involved."" The driver of the minivan was transported to a Falls Church hospital, where she was in listed in critical condition on Monday. Her condition on Wednesday was unknown. The sheriff's office says the remaining passengers -- all from Texas -- were all treated and discharged from area hospitals. The commonwealth's attorney's office is reviewing the matter. Mars and her two brothers privately own the company started by their grandfather that makes such universal sweet-tooth staples as Snickers, Milky Way, and M&M's. Today, Mars Inc. is the largest candy company in the world. Forbes says Jacqueline Mars has a net worth of $20.5 billion, making her the third richest woman in the country and the 15th wealthiest person in the United States.","Jacqueline Mars was a driver in a fatal car crash, Virginia sheriff's office says .

"London (CNN) -- Pencils have been sharpened, lunch boxes packed, now the bell is ringing. It's back to school time. And for many parents, this means reaching deep into their pockets. This year, shoppers in the U.S. will spend more than $26.5 billion on school items for nearly 50 million children going to public schools. The cost of kitting out a pupil has risen rapidly -- by nearly 50% in just five years, according to National Retail Federation. In the UK, the annual bill for items used by its 8.3 million children at school will be more than $4 billion, Santander research shows. The shopping spree makes the start of a new school year one of the busiest shopping periods for retailers, second only to the winter holiday season. The most expensive items on the shopping list are electronic gadgets, rapidly becoming essential items for school kids. Almost 60% of shoppers in the U.S. plan to buy electronic items for their children, while in the UK, 38% of parents purchase new technology for their kids, according to Bright House retailer. The NRF figures show American parents spend on average $211 per child, while uSwitch figures show their British counterparts fork out average $215 on each child's electronics. But school goods don't have to be high tech to be expensive. Pens, bags, books, lunch boxes and other essentials add up to whopping $98 per a child in the U.S. and slightly more modest $81 per youngster in the UK. School uniforms and other clothing items add up to $224 per child in the U.S., and $142 in the UK. On top of that, shoes cost on average $116 in the U.S. and $86 in the UK. But parents on both sides of the Atlantic said they are trying to keep their back to school spending in check. In the U.S., 31% of families plan to spend less overall and 34% said they were buying generic products rather than big brands to save money, according to the NRF.

"(CNN) -- The apprentice became the master as the wheels stopped turning in the 100th Tour de France on a balmy Paris evening. The man they called ""super domestique"" for his selfless service in helping Sir Bradley Wiggins to the 2012 crown is now top dog. Chris Froome won the world's greatest cycling road race Sunday to become the second successive Briton to win the Tour. The 28-year-old, runner-up in 2012, had pulled on the yellow jersey for the first time after the eighth stage of the 21-leg epic and from then on was never really challenged. Froome, who won three stages, finished four minutes and 20 seconds ahead of the field. Fellow climber Colombian Nairo Quintana -- a future prospect at just 23 years old -- finished as King of the Mountains and second overall. Spain's Joaquim Rodriguez took the final place on the podium, finishing third ahead of Spanish stalwart Alberto Contador. For the second year running, Slovakian Peter Sagan claimed the green jersey. The 23-year-old led the sprint category for 38 out of the 41 days he has raced in the Tour. A twilight finale saw the peloton parade past some famous Parisian landmarks, including the royal palace of Versailles and the Louvre museum, before a 10-lap loop of the Champs-Elysees came down to an intense sprint that was won by German Marcel Kittel ahead of Andre Greipel and Mark Cavendish. Froome finished the day-night stage in 114th place but after the glitzy centennial celebrations fizzled out he stood alone, shaking his head in disbelief, under the Arc De Triomphe as the Tour champion. ""I'd like to dedicate this win to my late mother who without her encouragement to follow my dream I'd probably be watching this event on the television,"" Froome said on the podium. ""To win the 100th edition is an honor beyond any dream. This is one yellow jersey that will stand the test of time."" Froome certainly learned valuable lessons supporting Wiggins in last year's Tour but his raw talent was forged cycling in the rural highlands of Kenya, where he was born. Kenyan cycling champion David Kinjah was Froome's first mentor -- long before Team Sky maestro Sir David Brailsford began to shape his career. ""He was just funny and happy, a white boy who accepted our village and ate our food,"" Kinjah recalled on BBC radio station 5 live. ""He would want to complete each and every training ride and he wouldn't stop. If he decided he wanted to complete the whole 100km he would do exactly that. ""No matter how much pain or how many hours he went through he would keep riding to the end."" Brailsford has also credited Froome's steely ambition to his battle with bilharzia -- a parasitic disease which he contracted during his childhood in Africa. Froome himself struggled to describe his feelings as he reflected on his route to success. ""For me, what this represents -- the journey I've taken to get here from where I started, riding on a little mountain bike back on dirt roads in Kenya,"" he told reporters in France. ""To be right here, the yellow jersey at the Tour de France, the biggest event on our cycling calendar... it's difficult for me to put into words."" The Tour may have finished in glory and glitter under Parisian lights but the world's most famous cycle race is still ridden in the shadow of Lance Armstrong's dubious legacy. The American was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles after admitting earlier this year to persistent use of banned substances during his halcyon days of domination. It was almost inevitable that some of Froome's performances raised eyebrows during his ride to victory. In this year's first mountain stage, the Briton won the energy-sapping 195-kilometer (121-mile) ride from Castres to Ax 3 Domaines 51 seconds ahead of his closest rival. There was another dominant performance from the 28-year-old as he conquered the gruelling Mont Ventoux -- at 150 miles the longest stage of the Tour -- just days later. Froome had to be given oxygen after his arduous efforts but his obvious fatigue did not stop questions being asked. In an attempt to end the finger-pointing surrounding Froome, Team Sky gave French newspaper L'Equipe data of 18 of his climbs since he made his major breakthrough in 2011. The French newspaper's sports science expert, Fred Grappe, was satisfied the results were consistent with doping-free riding. Commenting on the spectre of doping on broadcaster Eurosport 2 Froome said: ""On the back of the history of the sport and recent revelations whoever was wearing the yellow jersey was going to come under a lot of scrutiny. ""I hope I've shown the sport has changed and we as the peloton won't stand for it any longer."" Wiggins, who pulled out of this year's Tour because of a knee condition, told CNN that cycling's troubled history is now most useful when it is used in a light and shade comparison to where the sport was -- and where it is heading. ""It's had a tainted history but I think all that is a reminder of where the sport was and where it is now,"" he said. ""And it's in a great position."" And after emerging from shadows of his own, Froome will agree the future is bright.","Britain's Chris Froome wins the 100th Tour de France with a final ride into Paris .

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- From going to the moon to the explosion of the civil rights movement, the swinging 1960s was an era of conquering new heights and sweeping change. So when Newton Jibunoh had to return back home to Nigeria in 1966, after completing his studies in London, the young engineer thought it was also time for him to blaze new trails. An adventure seeker, Jibunoh decided to embark on a journey that was destined to change the course of his life. ""The Sahara was the largest desert in the world and very active -- so I decided to explore it,"" says Jibunoh, who was 27 at the time. Unfazed by the challenge, he drove home all alone by way of the desert -- from the UK, and ultimately through the vast, unforgiving sands of the Sahara, to Nigeria. ""Driving from Europe all the way across the Sahara, you must be ready to die,"" says Jibunoh, who has since traveled across the world's largest desert twice more. ""You have to tell yourself, 'look, it is possible I will die in the process,' and you must be ready for it because it's only when you're ready for that and you're confronted with death -- and I was confronted with death a number of times -- that you are able to deal with it. ""But if you're not ready to die and you're confronted with death, you panic and once you panic you lose focus and once you lose focus your life goes with it."" During his first solo expedition, Jibunoh was no stranger to near-death situations. He remembers negotiating for his life with bandits and having his possessions stolen; he recalls the intense loneliness of the epic journey and struggling through the desert without access to clean water. Yet despite all the difficulties, Jibunoh says the beauty of the desert made it all worthwhile. ""You wake up in the morning at about 5 o'clock ... and then you watch the sun rise and this extremely peaceful and serene atmosphere and then you just look at the sun coming like a ball of fire, rising from the sand and then coming up,"" recalls Jibunoh. ""At that time the temperature is close to zero in the desert, in the Sahara, so you can imagine a combination of that temperature and then looking up and watching this ball of fire coming out of the sand and creating a kind of scenery that you cannot find anywhere else in the world."" But apart from discovering the majesty of the Sahara, Jibunoh also witnessed how drought, deforestation and human intervention were turning fertile land into desert and condemning people to acute poverty. In 1999, after his second solo expedition across the Sahara, he realized he had to do something to help the people affected by desertification. ""I saw what is now known as the desertification, the encroachment of the desert,"" he remembers. ""I saw the fact that it was depriving people of their farmland, I saw that it was also affecting water supply; in some areas of the desert they don't have rainfall for about six-eight years, so I saw a completely different life and that was what led me into starting some kind of advocacy that will bring this whole thing to the global arena."" Since then, Jibunoh has dedicated his life to curbing the scourge of poverty caused by the desertification. Now a prominent environmentalist, he started giving lectures, speaking at summits and visiting other deserts around the world -- from the Gobi in China and the Negev in Israel, to Arizona and Las Vegas -- to study how people across the world had succeeded in taming the desert and dealing with drought and famine. Jibunoh's desire to take more direct action against the problem also prompted him to launch the Fight Against Desert Encroachment (FADE) initiative and set up a pilot project in the desert area of northern Nigeria. ""The FADE issue became a topical one because people were now able to see that you can actually recover land from the desert by doing some, what we call, land reclamation arrangement,"" says Jibunoh, who also runs a museum in central Lagos. Jibunoh realized early on that combating the encroachment of the desert is a process that takes decades and requires collaboration, so he teamed up with Nigerian officials and started working with schools and universities to create a long-term effort. And in 2008, aged 70, embarked on his third and last expedition across the Sahara. This time he traveled with a group of scientists and environmentalists -- a means of passing on the torch to the younger generation, a process he enthusiastically continues to this day. He adds: ""I am in the process of putting together a formidable team ... of young men and women that can take over this crusade, that can take over this whole initiative and carry it to the next generation, that is my primary hope.""","Newton Jibunoh is a Nigerian environmentalist and explorer .

"London (CNN) -- Abdul Waheed Majeed first hit the headlines in 1982. A faded clipping from his hometown newspaper in Crawley, just outside London, carried a photo of the then 10-year-old clutching his pet cat ""Billy."" The full-page report, titled ""Cat On A Hot Roof"" told how young Majeed raced into the burning wreckage of his mother's corner store and rescued his furry friend. Three decades later -- in February -- Majeed's story hit the media again. The headline this time: ""Video of British suicide bomber released."" The reports came just after al Qaeda-linked jihadis in Syria posted an online video showing a suicide attack on the notorious Aleppo prison. President Bashar al-Assad's brutal regime was reportedly torturing hundreds of prisoners there. The recording showed Majeed, who made his living in Britain driving a highway maintenance truck, crashing into the prison gates at the wheel of a Mad Max-style dump truck. Thick steel plates had been welded to the cab of the vehicle for protection against enemy gunfire. ""I miss my son so much. He was a good boy,"" his mother Maqbool Majeed whispered to me during our conversation at her home in Crawley, about an hour's drive from central London. She said she came with her husband from Pakistan to Britain almost 60 years ago. Her two sons and a daughter were born and raised in England. Photos from the family album show the Majeed children had what appeared to be a fairly normal British childhood. When Majeed reached adulthood he married and is survived by his wife and three teenage children. Majeed's elder brother Hafeez has rarely spoken publicly since the suicide bombing. But he made clear that's not out of shame. ""We feel no shame whatsoever,"" he said. ""Whatever [my brother Abdul] Waheed did, his intentions were bona fide and true to the heart. His whole purpose was to save people in that prison who had been tortured and raped."" In the video depicting his final moments, Majeed appears calm as camouflage-clad Chechen jihadis wrap their arms around his shoulders. Syrian rebel sources say that unit had recently defected from ISIS to the al Qaeda-affiliated al Nusra Front. His childhood friend Raheed Mahmood, who traveled to Syria with him, said Majeed appeared composed. ""He was obviously at peace,"" Mahmood told me. ""The idea wasn't troubling him in any way. I can only put that down to faith and the idea he knew where he was going."" An electrician and plumber by trade, Mahmood returned to Crawley about a month before Majeed blew himself to smithereens in that attack at the start of February. Mahmood and Majeed volunteered as drivers on an aid convoy operated by a group of British-based Muslim charities in late July 2013. A handful of Muslim NGOs are currently being investigated by UK authorities on suspicion they may have been funnelling British fighters to extremist groups in Syria or may have violated fund-raising rules by donating cash to radical groups. ""There was lot of talk of convoys going down there and taking aid, ""Mahmood said. ""Abdul Waheed just raised the issue and asked me how I felt, so I turned round and said let's do it."" Once in northern Syria, not far from the Turkish border, the pair volunteered to stay on, helping civilians in refugee camps. Majeed's truck driving skills were in high demand. He also knew how to operate diggers and helped build new camps and lay drainage pipes. Mahmood described the myriad Syrian rebel groups as a ""people's resistance force"" and said most people in the refugee camps had relatives fighting against the Assad regime. They frequently saw gun-trucks and heavily armed rebels driving through. They regularly saw fighters from all the factions, including ISIS and al Nusra, in the camps, sometimes bringing supplies to stranded civilians. ""ISIS would come and help as would the other groups,"" he said. ""You'd hear about people swapping from group to group unsure of whom to fight with. Young people would be promoting their group. It didn't really seem to matter too much whom you were fighting for."" But Mahmood said he had no idea his friend Majeed had been recruited. The soon-to-be bomber had sent his family plenty of pictures showing him hard at work in tent camps. Many of the snaps showed him surrounded by children. In one, he was even wearing flashing ""Minnie Mouse"" ears in an apparent effort to brighten up daily life for youngsters around him. According to his brother, Majeed never made a farewell phone call to his family. The last time he phoned in January, his family assumed it was just a routine weekly catch-up. ""In retrospect I should perhaps have paid more attention to that phone conversation,"" his brother Hafeez told me. ""He said he loved us all very much. He said I know you're looking after the family and if I've done any wrongs I hope you can forgive me."" He never phoned again. Behind him in the small family garden, filled with summer flowers, his mother shed silent tears. ""I don't know what happened. I just don't know. Only God knows,"" she said. Neither family nor friends say they had any inkling Majeed was planning to blow himself up. There were contradictory reports about how successful the attack was. Some accounts suggested more than 300 prisoners had been freed. Other reports claimed Majeed detonated the truck short of its intended target. His brother, though, describes the infamous Assad-regime prison as a ""legitimate military target."" ""If he had been a British soldier and carried out that brave act of heroism, he would have been awarded the posthumous Victoria Cross,"" he said, referring to the British military's highest honor for valor. Unsurprisingly, the British government did not agree. UK intelligence services estimate that more than 500 British nationals may be fighting with ISIS or other jihadi groups in Syria or Iraq. And British Prime Minister David Cameron has announced new measures to crack down on Islamic extremism and block Britons returning from conflict zones in the Middle East. ""Our family didn't have time to grieve. As soon as we took a breath the police were knocking on our door to carry out searches under the Prevention of Terrorism Act,"" Hafeez Majeed said. Since his death, police and media investigations have revealed Majeed's alleged links to radical Islamists in Britain. In an interview with a London newspaper, Syrian-born imam Omar Bakri Mohammad claimed Majeed had been his driver on an unspecified number of visits to Crawley between 1996 and 2004. The UK government excluded Bakri from Britain in 2005, accusing him of being a hate preacher. The same newspaper report alleged Majeed had been friends with two Muslim men -- also from Crawley -- convicted in 2007 of plotting to bomb a London nightclub. Hafeez Majeed explained his brother had chauffeured Bakri on a ""few"" occasions but did not share his radical interpretation of Islam. ""He wasn't as, press speculation says, a jihadist, a man born to fight. He had no instances of violence at all in the UK. He was not a threat to the British public,"" Hafeez Majeed said. Majeed does not fit the profile, being promoted by the government, of a Muslim misfit living a deprived existence, easy prey for radical Islamist preachers or online recruiters. His brother says it was perhaps the sight of civilians suffering in the war in Syria or horror stories of the Assad regime's action that may have pushed Majeed to become a suicide bomber. But he's sure that, if he had realized in time, he would have tried to halt his brother's mission. ""If I had known I would have told him please don't do it,"" Hafeez Majeed said. ""Please, please, please. You're much better off being alive so you can help all those people.""","British-born Abdul Waheed Majeed carried out a suicide bomb attack on Aleppo prison .

"(CNN) -- Government troops fought fresh battles with opposition fighters in Yemen's capital, Sanaa, early Friday as the country's embattled president tried to put down a tribal revolt. Troops backed by tanks were nearing the home of tribal leader Sadeq Al-Ahmar, whose followers have been battling troops loyal to President Ali Abdullah Saleh for nearly two weeks, witnesses reported. The nearby headquarters of Yemen's national airline was ablaze, with surrounding houses catching fire as well, witnesses said. Government spokesman Abdu Ganadi told CNN said Saleh's forces ""are near victory."" But Abdulqawi Al-Qaisi, a spokesman for Al-Ahmar, said ""All government claims of victory are fabricated, and our forces are still on the ground."" And in Change Square, where tens of thousands of anti-government protesters have made camp, witnesses said gunmen on surrounding streets were firing into the crowd, while snipers were visible on nearby rooftops. ""It's very tense inside Change Square now, because there is a fear that government forces might attempt to come into Change Square and take it over at any time,"" one of the protesters, who asked to remain anonymous due to security concerns, told CNN. A nearby resident said the fighting had subsided after midnight, however. ""We're still hearing bombs and gunfire, but not as much as we were just an hour ago,"" the resident said. The fighting erupted May 23, after Saleh balked at a deal negotiated by Persian Gulf states that would have eased him from office in 30 days. The intensity of the fighting in the capital, where most of Yemen's security forces and army units are based, has increased fears that the country is on the verge of civil war. Saleh has ruled Yemen since 1978, and the nation has been a key U.S. ally in the battle against the al Qaeda terrorist network. But Yemen was caught up in the wave of protests that swept the Arab world after the January ouster of Tunisia's longtime strongman, leaving Saleh battling both peaceful and violent resistance movements. The impoverished, arid and mountainous nation has a weak central government and contains vast stretches where tribal law reigns supreme. A fresh group of about 1,000 armed tribesmen were seen entering Sanaa early Thursday, Sanaa resident Nageeb Mujaili said. ""We asked them why they were going to Sanaa armed,"" said Mujaili. ""And they said to support their leader, Sheikh Sadeq Al-Ahmar."" Yemeni state television reported that government forces had beaten back tribal fighters from areas of the capital near the Ministry of Tourism building on Thursday, and Sanaa residents reported hearing explosions near the presidential palace, a government source said. ""The reason the street fighting in Sanaa has gotten a lot more intense in the past several hours is because special forces are now involved,"" said the source, who asked not to be identified because he is not authorized to speak to the news media. ""The special forces of the Republican Guard, the elite units, got involved on Wednesday. They're being used because the government wants to minimize collateral damage and the special forces have particular training in clearing fighters from buildings."" A security official at Sanaa International Airport said inbound and outbound flights were halted due because of security concerns over clashes near the airport. But the official, who is not authorized to speak to the media, said that the airport itself is not closed.","NEW: New fighting reported near the home of the leader of a tribal revolt .

"(CNN) -- Comedians Keegan Michael Key and Jordan Peele, the brains behind the hit Comedy Central sketch show ""Key & Peele,"" joked that President Barack Obama is the idol black nerds have longed for and needed. ""Obama was the best thing for black nerds everywhere. Finally we had a role model,"" Peele humorously told reporters recently. ""Before Obama, we basically had Urkel."" Black nerds, aka ""blerds,"" is a way to describe African-American intellectuals in a time when it's finally cool to be something other than an athlete or rapper. ""There have long been African-American intellectuals,"" said Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., whose new genealogical show, ""Finding Your Roots with Henry Louis Gates Jr.,"" debuted last Sunday on PBS. ""The difference with my generation and those after is that there are more of us in the spotlight,"" Gates said. ""With my PBS specials, I drew a record 25 million viewers. I wouldn't have been able to do that without the platform I have."" ""It's good to see black intellectuals do well,"" he said. ""We as a people are a whole range of things, and we're finally starting to see that reflected in the media."" Because there is a growing number of prominent and successful people considered blerds such as President Obama, Gates and astrophysicist and PBS star Neil deGrasse Tyson, TV viewers are starting to see more and more blerd-type characters on their favorite comedies and even children's programs. That's right. Lance Robertson, aka DJ Lance Rock from Nickelodeon's ""Yo Gabba Gabba!"" is a total blerd. The list also includes comedic actor Jordan Carlos from ""I Just Want My Pants Back"" on MTV; Aisha Tyler from FX's ""Archer"" and ""Happy Endings"" star Damon Wayans Jr. on ABC. ""I'm a black nerd and that was illegal until 2003,"" joked Donald Glover in one of his Comedy Central standup specials. Glover has also started blending his nerdy habits in with that of his ""Community"" character, Troy. A comedian and a former writer for ""30 Rock,"" Glover has created a whole stand-up act trumpeting blerds like the president and rapper Kanye West. ""Strange, specific stuff -- that's what makes a nerd a nerd,"" Glover has explained during his bit. ""Kanye West is a black nerd. If you go up to Kanye West and say 'Hey, what are your favorite things?' He'd be like 'Robots and Teddy bears.'"" ""That's a nerd."" Similar observations have been made by comedian and actor Kevin Hart (a guest star on ABC's ""Modern Family""). Like Glover, Hart has created a new brand of dorky, self-deprecating humor that is completely different than that of their comedy predecessors, Eddie Murphy and Chris Rock. ""It's fashionable to wear bowties and be educated,"" said Dave Nemetz, a TV content producer for Yahoo! ""It's part of multiculturalism and with everything blending together, there's a certain subset of (black nerd life) that's becoming cool right now. ""Nerds are cool right now in general and that's certainly an aspect."" Nemetz said the rise in characters such as Brad (Damon Wayans Jr.) on ""Happy Endings"" is also the result of color-blind casting. ""Damon Wayans' character wouldn't necessarily be a black character the way it was written,"" Nemetz said. ""He's fantastic and that helped him get cast but I also think once you get people from different cultures coming in, and taking roles that may not have been written for them, you see this type of advancement. ""Twenty years ago, it would've been out of place to have this character there because it wasn't happening culturally."" Carlos, who also does standup, said his blerd character Eric on ""I Just Want My Pants Back"" was Jewish in the David J. Rosen book the show is based on. Rosen also created the TV show and Eric is a medical student. ""I like that they were open to different people coming in and going against type,"" Carlos said of the show's producers. ""I've been Pookie Crack Head No. 2, but I'd never been a member of a cast."" Alphonso McAuley, plays a blerd on the Fox comedy ""Breaking In."" He said his character Cash is into ""Star Wars"" way more than he is in real life, in spite of the fact that he owns not one but two ""Star Wars"" Lego sets. ""Up until now, black nerds weren't being celebrated,"" McAuley said. ""We've seen the thug, the athlete, the rapper and the comedic best friend. This is something different. ""It's cool to be uncool.""","Black nerds or 'blerds' are increasingly visible in pop culture .

"(CNN) -- After she was raped at Harvard, Madeleine Smith said that in her pursuit of justice she encountered people with good intentions who could not help her. One in five women is sexually assaulted while in college, according to the National Institute of Justice, and Smith is not the only victim who has been stonewalled by what she called ""archaic and misinformed policies."" Vice President Joe Biden, joining her Tuesday at an event at the White House on sexual assault on college campuses, said ""We are never going to solve this epidemic until we get men involved."" In a video montage, Hollywood actors Benicio del Toro, Daniel Craig, Steve Carell, Seth Myers and Dule Hill join President Barack Obama and Biden to encourage men to be part of the solution for a new public service announcement on sexual assault that will air in movie theaters this May. Biden said that in the neighborhood where he came from, ""if a man raised his hand to a woman you had the job to kick the crap out of him."" White House advises colleges on how to combat rape . According to the ""1 is 2 Many"" campaign, which is coordinating the PSA release with the White House, young women ages 16 to 24 experience the highest rates of sexual violence at the hands of someone they know, so publicly announcing to Americans that rape is wrong, and a crime, is necessary. ""If she doesn't consent -- or can't consent -- it's rape; it's assault,"" says del Toro in the PSA. ""It's a crime. It's wrong,"" says Steve Carell. But it's more complicated than that. In Smith's case, there were ""definite good guys,"" the people at Harvard's Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, and ""definite bad guys,"" her attacker and the Harvard ""faculty that gamed the system in order to support him."" The real issue, harder to pin down, said Smith, is everyone else ""who fell somewhere in between."" The White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault first alerted schools about their responsibilities to survivors of sexual violence in 2011. Under Title IX, schools had to address sexual violence in order to provide equal access to education. Schools failing to do so, like Tufts University, have been publicly cited. Student activism takes many forms in fight to end campus rape . Now, the administration is highlighting the importance of having confidential advocates on college campuses. The hope is to clarify that not everyone on college campuses has a duty to report. Otherwise, says the task force, ""a survivor quickly loses control over what happens next,"" a critical issue for advocates like Smith who emphasize the importance of returning control to survivors. The task force Tuesday called for further training, saying ""insensitive or judgmental comments -- or questions that focus on a victim's behavior (e.g., what she was wearing, her prior sexual history) rather than on the alleged perpetrators -- can compound a victim's distress."" In encouraging women to report sexual assault, and men to speak up, Biden invoked the film ""Deliverance."" ""I know what scene you remembered, right?"" he asked. ""How many of you would walk out of the woods and report 'I've been raped?'"" Transparency and accountability are major issues the White House task force is set to deal with. No college wants to admit it has a problem, but, paradoxically, those schools with the highest numbers may actually be taking the problem seriously because they have systems in place that allow students to file complaints. Smith Tuesday highlighted how hard it is to report a sexual assault. ""I want to share what it is like when your dad answers the phone, and you have to find a way to tell him that the one thing he never wanted to happen to his little girl has happened,"" she said.","Biden speaks at White House event on college sex assaults .

"(CNN) -- Ambitious plans for a ""city in the city"" skyscraper that could house apartments, offices, shops and parks have been revealed. The award-winning proposal ""Endless City"" drawn up by Beijing based firm SURE Architecture could see a tower of up to 300 meters being built in London. ""We tried to design a city rather than a high rise building,"" SURE Architecture's global director and chief architect Kam Fai Tai told CNN. The proposed tower, which won the SuperSkyScrapers Award 2014, has two continuous ramps or ""streets"" running the entire length of the building, lined with shops, apartments, parks and museums. Designed to replicate a DNA structure, designers hope the tower will ""increase exchanges, communications and interactions"" and offer views across London. They also hope to create eye-catching internal vistas by including a series of plazas with ""individual character"" throughout the tower. Inside the tower, ""there is no limit...you can walk in the same way you can walk around a city,"" SURE's Alina Valcarce said. The ramps are designed to widen near the top of the building, enabling natural light and ventilation to filter down and save on energy costs. It is also structured to collect and recycle rain water. The building would be supported by six steel tubes, hiding the building's electrical wiring and plumbing. According to the plan, the tower could rise as high as London's tallest tower, The Shard, or New York's Chrysler Building. The architects have identified a site for the proposal, but are yet to start any application process. Tai hopes the project will encourage people to think about vertical designs that would, in the future, bring the feeling of a city inside a building. ""'Endless' is also about continuity between the pattern, the street level and the building. Right now, buildings have a big distinction between street level and the space inside the building,"" Valcarce said.

"Washington (CNN) -- Today is a good day for liberty. By striking down the unprecedented requirement that Americans buy health insurance -- the ""individual mandate"" -- Judge Henry Hudson vindicated the idea that ours is a government of delegated and enumerated, and thus limited, powers. But this should not be surprising, for the Constitution does not grant the federal government the power to force private commercial transactions. Even if the Supreme Court has broadened the scope of Congress' authority under the Commerce Clause -- it can now reach local activities that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce -- never before has it allowed people to face a civil penalty for declining to buy a particular product. Hudson found therefore that the individual mandate ""is neither within the letter nor the spirit of the Constitution."" Stated another way, every exercise of Congress' power to regulate interstate commerce has involved some form of action or transaction engaged in by an individual or legal entity. The government's theory -- that the decision not to buy insurance is an economic one that affects interstate commerce in various ways -- would, for the first time ever, permit laws commanding people to engage in economic activity. Under such a reading, which judges in two other cases have unfortunately adopted, nobody would ever be able to plausibly claim that the Constitution limits congressional power. The federal government would then have wide authority to require that Americans engage in activities ranging from eating spinach and joining gyms (in the health care realm) to buying GM cars. Congress could tell people what to study or what job to take: We need fewer lawyers and more engineers, right? As Hudson put it, ""This broad definition of the economic activity subject to congressional regulation lacks logical limitation and is unsupported by Commerce Clause jurisprudence."" Indeed, not even in the infamous 1942 case of Wickard v. Filburn -- when the Supreme Court ratified Congress' regulation of what farmers grew in their backyards on the theory that such local activity, in the aggregate, affects national wheat prices -- have courts faced such a breathtaking assertion of raw federal power. Even at the height of the New Deal, Congress did not attempt to force people to buy wheat to support the new national agricultural policy. So too now, when there is a stark difference between Congress' power to regulate the health insurance industry and a purported power to require someone to buy health insurance. It's the same difference as between the power to regulate the auto industry and -- under some scheme to bail out companies that are ""too big to fail"" -- to require everyone to buy a Chevy. To be sure, there are situations in which the government may force individuals to engage in business. Most notably, it can require hotels and restaurants to serve all patrons. But nobody has to become a hotelier or restaurateur, or purchase lodging or food -- and individuals are not commercial enterprises. As for the oft-invoked car insurance analogy, being required to buy insurance if you choose to drive is different from having to buy it because you are alive. And it is states that impose car insurance mandates, under their general police powers -- which the federal government lacks. And so today was a bad day for those who say that Congress is the arbiter of its own powers and that the only checks on federal power in the regulation of commerce are political. We have come far from the time when pundits dismissed the lawsuits challenging the new health care law as frivolous political gimmicks. This is still the beginning of a long legal journey -- there's a hearing this Thursday in the Florida-led 20-state lawsuit, then appeals in all the various cases, and none of this will be over till the Supreme Court has its say -- but we can now see the day where this unprecedented claim of federal power is definitively rejected as fundamentally contrary to our constitutional order. As Hudson said, ""Despite the laudable intentions of Congress in enacting a comprehensive and transformative health care regime, the legislative process must still operate within constitutional bounds. Salutatory [sic] goals and creative drafting have never been sufficient to offset an absence of enumerated powers."" It is perhaps most appropriate that this ruling happened during the Christmas season, for now we can all see that yes, Virginia, there are limits on government. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ilya Shapiro.","Ilya Shapiro: Federal judge in Va. says government can't mandate health insurance purchase .

"(TIME.com) -- Just before heading to bed one night in August, I got a text message from Bibhu Mohapatra. It contained a photo of First Lady Michelle Obama in a citrus-print sleeveless sheer yoke cocktail dress. Above it, a message: ""Just found out, Michelle is wearing the yellow dress."" Mohapatra has dressed Kristen Wiig, Hilary Swank and Glenn Close, but this was different. There she was, America's fashion icon on The Tonight Show, validating Mohapatra's work before a national audience. It is Mohapatra's moment, but it's a story that almost wasn't. He had never been on a plane before 1995, when he left his native Orissa, India, at age 23 with a one-way ticket to Logan, Utah, to pursue a master's degree in economics on an academic scholarship to Utah State University. Between homework assignments, he'd sketch. And sketch. Until, by chance, a professor saw his sketchbook of dresses, jackets and coats and said, ""You're in the wrong business."" So Mohapatra called his dad, who told him, ""Close your eyes and picture yourself 10 years from now, having the most fun, being the most happy -- that's your answer."" Mohapatra packed his bags, moved to New York City and landed a spot at the Fashion Institute of Technology, where he could finally pursue his lifelong passion. Time.com: Fashion's Sister Act: A Conversation with Rodarte's Kate and Laura Mulleavy . Now 40 and a newly minted member of the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA), Mohapatra launched his namesake label in 2009 after nine years at J. Mendel, where he worked his way up from assistant to design director. ""As a creative person, you want to start with a blank canvas,"" he says. ""This is like having the biggest canvas on which to paint."" His clothes do have a painterly quality: rich color, prints and patterns on structured silhouettes. Modern yet supremely feminine. There are shades of India, too, in the embroidery and beading -- traditional dressmaking techniques that Mohapatra likes to call ""Old World bones."" I recently paid him a visit at his cavernous, 5,000-sq.-ft. studio in the heart of Manhattan's garment district -- a big upgrade from the cramped 600-sq.-ft. space a block away where he used to work. His new spot is a sea of white walls and columns punctuated by splashes of color: a sage gown with beads and feathers from his 2013 resort collection and a chaise longue he found on the street and re-covered in lapis-print fabric of his own design. He greets me at the door with his signature boyish grin and a hug. ""He has the biggest smile in fashion and lacks any of the attitude that sometimes comes with a young designer's success,"" says Steven Kolb, the CFDA's CEO. ""Bibhu is a gracious and tasteful gentleman,"" says Linda Fargo, senior vice president of Bergdorf Goodman, Mohapatra's biggest account. ""His mÃ©tier is elegance."" As Mohapatra describes them, his designs are a study in opposites. ""Masculine and feminine, graphic and organic, but always staying true to the core of making beautiful clothes,"" he says. He has a hat trick of debuts coming up: in September, he'll show his first collection with handbags; in January, his first pre-fall collection; in February, a complete line of handbags. ""A lot of exciting things are happening,"" he says. ""I hope to grow another head and two more hands,"" he adds with a laugh, ""like an Indian goddess.""

"(CNN) -- One of sport's most high-profile couples are no more. Golf star Rory McIlroy announced Wednesday that he had broken off his engagement to tennis player Caroline Wozniacki. The two-time major winner from Northern Ireland said the issuing of wedding invitations over the weekend had made him realize he wasn't prepared for ""all that marriage entails."" McIlroy and former world No. 1 Wozniacki, from Denmark, announced their engagement via social media on New Year's Day -- but their three-year relationship is now over. ""There is no right way to end a relationship that has been so important to two people,"" McIlroy said in a statement reported by the UK Press Association. ""The problem is mine. The wedding invitations issued at the weekend made me realize that I wasn't ready for all that marriage entails. ""I wish Caroline all the happiness she deserves and thank her for the great times we've had. ""I will not be saying anything more about our relationship in any setting."" McIlroy, ranked 10th in the world, is currently preparing for the European Tour's flagship event -- the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth in England. He spoke briefly about the split at a press conference ahead of Thursday's opening round, telling reporters: ""Obviously (it's) quite a difficult time for Caroline and myself. ""I think the statement really said it all this morning. It was mutual and amicable and we both thought it was the best for us, the best for both of us. Time to move on and I think I've said all that I need to say. ""Now I need to get my head into golf and concentrate on the tournament, keep myself busy and try and have a good week on the course. ""I'm not going to lie. It's going to be very difficult. But you know, at least when I get inside the ropes I can just try and concentrate on the shot at hand. But yeah, it's obviously going to be difficult."" Only on Sunday McIlroy tweeted a picture while the pair were enjoying dinner together at Nobu restaurant in Monte Carlo. The couple, who were referred to as 'Wozzilroy' by the world's media, began dating in 2011 after meeting at a boxing match. They had to deal with constant rumors as to their health of their relationship, which were magnified when both suffered slumps in their career during 2013. But on January 1 they took to their respective Twitter accounts to confirm they were engaged to be married with Wozniacki saying: ""Rory and I started 2014 with a bang! ... I said YES!!!!"" McIlroy captured his first major title at the U.S. Open in 2011 and followed it up by claiming the US PGA Championship the following year, but has struggled for form of late. Wozniacki, who is yet to win a grand slam title but did top the world rankings in 2010, is preparing for the second major of the tennis season -- the French Open -- which starts on May 25. She made her first response to the split on Twitter Thursday saying, ""It's a hard time for me right now. Thanks for all the sweet messages! Happy I support Liverpool right now because I know I'll never walk alone.""","Rory McIlroy breaks off engagement with tennis star Caroline Wozniacki .

"(CNN) -- After a weeklong campaign by a coalition of more than 100 women's groups, Facebook announced Tuesday that it would update its guidelines and moderator training to crack down on gender-based hate speech. This commitment, though only a prelude to effective and consistent implementation, marks a watershed moment in the cultural evolution of the billion-user-strong social media platform -- and perhaps even of the entire internet. The activist campaign spotlighted a proliferation of content glorifying rape and other violence against women on Facebook. Groups and images with allegedly humorous titles like ""Raping a Pregnant B***h and Telling Your Friends You Had a Threesome"" have always been only a click away and, under Facebook's content policy until now, stood a better chance of surviving moderator review than photos of breastfeeding babies did. Some have criticized the activist campaign as an attack on free speech, but free speech here is a red herring at best. Facebook is a private enterprise, and the First Amendment quite simply is not the issue. Like any private online service, Facebook also has a right to set terms of use and a responsibility to shareholders to meet users' needs. Some 60,000 tweets to the campaign's #fbrape hashtag made clear that violently misogynistic content was doing damage to Facebook's relationship with its user base. Facebook makes thousands of decisions a day about what sort of content is acceptable on its site. Soraya Chemaly, one of the founders of this month's campaign along with activist groups Women Action and the Media and Everyday Sexism, told me that Facebook's moderation of ads or content like breastfeeding photos ""put them in a position of interpreting this content and deciding what would stay up and what would not. ... It became evident that there was a double standard when it came to gender."" Viewed in that light, Facebook's response to the activist campaign signals not a radical change of agenda but rather a refinement to its existing content policies. Yet its significance for women can't be overstated. The acceptability of speech glorifying sexual or other violence against women is a sure measure of the degree to which women's full participation -- on a website, in any public space or in a society -- is welcome. Facebook is to be commended for committing to take additional steps to ensure that women are as welcome on its service as men. Twitter, Tumblr, Google+ and the rest would do well to follow in Facebook's footsteps. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michelle Kinsey Bruns.","Facebook agrees to crack down on gender-based hate speech .

"(CNN) -- Google Glass is crazy fun, but don't worry if you missed your chance to buy a pair on Tuesday, when it went on sale to the public for $1,500. While the current generation of Google Glass is doomed to become a clunky eBay collectible, it's nonetheless a leading indicator of a vast wearables revolution poised to sweep into our lives. That is, if it can get past some hurdles as we speak. There's been anti-tech backlash against Google Glass. Not everyone is down with it -- for reasons such as privacy -- but when these challenges are overcome then we're in for some interesting times. Eyeglass companies are already designing sleeker, less pricey versions of wearable displays, and developers are busy creating better apps. Simply put, the information revolution is moving from personal to intimate. It is just the latest chapter in a long trend that began in the 1980s when computers arrived on our desktops. Then in the 1990s, the gizmos shrank into laptops and disappeared into our backpacks and briefcases. Google Glass targeted as symbol by anti-tech crowd . With the arrival of smartphones a decade ago, our computers now fit into a pocket, becoming constant companions. At each stage of this evolution, our devices insinuated themselves ever deeper into our lives, performing ever more essential tasks and becoming ever more important info-companions. Now our devices are poised to disappear. They will disappear into our lives as small, absolutely essential tools that we will notice only when we lose them. Info-glasses today are like PCs in 1984 -- they look cool but perform a few functions that aren't all that useful, such as taking pictures or surfing the Web while sitting in a bar with friends. But just as PCs quickly became vastly more useful than mere word processors, new info-glass apps will allow us to perform more essential tasks. Professionals from surgeons to surveyors are already prototyping apps that help them work in smarter ways. On the personal front, imagine an app that uses face recognition to tell you the name of the acquaintance walking toward you and your spouse at a cocktail party, sparing everyone the embarrassment of a fumbled introduction. This is just one example of what is coming. Just as we have been surprised by search and social media, we are certain to be astonished by the capabilities of the device sitting on the bridge of our nose. The scale of surprise is certain to be huge because info-glasses are just one of a zoo of wearable devices that are coming into our lives. Health-centered devices such as the Fitbit are already wrapping themselves around our wrists, competing for space with a new generation of smart watches. Other devices will live in our pockets and eventually will be woven into the fabric of the clothes we wear. Some devices are destined to become yet more intimate, living under our skin. Some will be serious medical devices. Others will be for sheer whimsy -- imagine a subdermal display that is in effect a changeable electronic tattoo. Hobbyist hackers today can buy an implantable RFID chip kit complete with injector for less than $100. Implant it in your hand and use it to talk with electronic door locks. All of these devices will communicate with each other and info-glass successors to Google Glass are likely to become an important control panel for communication between wearables and their human owners. Bicyclists will use info-glasses as a heads-up display for everything from road speed and map route to heart rate and glucose levels. Our new wearables will, with very few exceptions, also be in constant communication with cyberspace and real-time information systems. Parents who are out to dinner will be able to discretely listen in on the baby monitor back home or view streaming video off a bedroom webcam. The arrival of Google Glass has resulted in a debate over where and when info-glasses can be worn. Just like similar debates over pagers, cell phones and smartphones in years past, wearables will likely be everywhere. Besides, unlike smartphones, info-glass hardware is going to quickly shrink into near-invisibility. Within a few years, smart glasses will be indistinguishable from an ordinary pair of vintage 2014 specs. And after that? How about info-contact lens that can check your vital signs? And privacy? Forget about it. We are destined to become like tagged bears, constantly tracked, but too addicted to the data stream to switch our intimate devices off.","Paul Saffo: Current Google Glasses are doomed to become eBay collectibles .

"(CNN) -- Caroline Wozniacki has had her critics in the past. A defensive game and not landing a grand slam title while she was ranked No. 1 provided fodder for her detractors. But now everyone, it seems, is rooting for the Dane. Why? Well, much of it must be down to the fact that Wozniacki was dumped -- and very publicly -- by golf sensation Rory McIlroy only months before they were due to tie the knot. McIlroy ended the relationship in May, saying he wasn't ready for marriage, and the news left Wozniacki devastated. She was visibly distraught as she spoke to reporters at the French Open soon after, and exited in the first round, her earliest loss at Roland Garros in seven years. The Northern Irishman has since rediscovered his vintage form, claiming he is more focused, and has won two major titles and regained his No. 1 ranking. Wozniacki has also picked up her game after a lengthy slump. She's the favorite to reach the U.S. Open final from the bottom half of the draw after upsetting Maria Sharapova on Sunday. And whereas Wozniacki said earlier in 2014 she would like to become a young mother -- suggesting her tennis days were numbered -- her own focus is now solely on the court. That Wozniacki is prospering in New York is slightly ironic -- it was where she was reportedly supposed to marry McIlroy in November. She's sure to return to the Big Apple that month, however, having decided following their split to run in the New York City Marathon. Wozniacki has so far refused to discuss her relationship with McIlroy at the U.S. Open, not that any of the fans minded. The crowd at Arthur Ashe Stadium in her match against Sharapova was firmly behind the 24-year-old, leading her to gush afterwards: ""The crowd was amazing today."" Her victory over Sharapova put Wozniacki into a first grand slam quarterfinal since the 2012 Australian Open. ""The season for me has been a little bit up and down,"" Wozniacki said. ""And it's so nice to kind of start feeling like I'm playing the way I want to. ""This hard-court season has been amazing for me. I actually started already feeling really good on court since Eastbourne (in June). I have just been building on my game since then."" Wozniacki won a title in Istanbul in July and even though she didn't add to her haul in Montreal and Cincinnati, the player that stopped her was world No. 1 Serena Williams. Both of their encounters went to three sets. They have become good friends this year, spending time together in Miami after their early departures from the French Open. Although Wozniacki still can't be considered an attacking player, her serve has improved, and she has become more aggressive on the baseline. Her retrieving, though, is still what gives opponents problems. Making Sharapova keep running paid off, as the Russian committed 43 unforced errors. ""I think she's better at what she's done really well in her career,"" Sharapova said. ""I think she's moving extremely well; she's fit. ""I mean, she's always been fit, but there is a little bit more on her defense shots. ""It's not just balls up in the air. She's doing a little bit more with them."" Wozniacki faces another counter puncher, Sara Errani, in the last eight on Tuesday, and could face Williams -- again -- in the final. Williams advanced to the quarterfinals Monday by beating Estonia's Kaia Kanepi 6-3 6-3. ""I have had a great summer, and I told Serena I'm pretty tired of her,"" said Wozniacki. ""I said, 'Can you just get out of my way?' ""We just laugh about it. This one was a great win for me. Maria, again, is a good player. For me, I think mentally as well to get that in my pocket is kind of nice. ""I still have hopefully a few good matches in me here in this tournament."" Pennetta continues U.S. success . New York is also proving to be a happy hunting ground for Flavia Pennetta, a semifinalist last year. The Italian won the biggest title of her career in Indian Wells, California in March but has done little to back that up since. However, the 11th seed is now one win away from matching that feat after topping Australia's Casey Dellacqua 7-5 6-2 in early play Monday to earn a place in the last eight. But to get any further the 32-year-old will have to get past defending champion Williams. The winner of that match will face either former world No. 1 Victoria Azarenka or Russia's Ekaterina Makarova. Azarenka, a beaten finalist in New York the past two years but seeded 16th after a year of injury problems, came from behind to beat Serbia's Aleksandra Krunic 4-6 6-4 6-4. Makarova, the 17th seed, reached the last eight for the second year in a row after upsetting Canada's rising star Eugenie Bouchard, winning 7-6 (7-2) 6-4 against the seventh seed. Meanwhile, men's No. 1 Novak Djokovic beat Germany's Philipp Kohlschreiber 6-1 7-5 6-4 and will face Andy Murray in the quarterfinals. Eighth seed Murray, who beat Djokovic in the 2012 final to win his first grand slam title, brushed off France's world No. 10 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 7-5 7-5 6-4.

"(CNN) -- Few things distract from the discomfort of flying better than a decent roster of films on the seatback in front of you. As technology progresses, however, those imbedded screens may soon go the way of the dinosaurs. The question is, will passengers be better off for it? At the annual Aircraft Interior Expo in Hamburg next week, exhibitors will showcase the latest innovations in the aviation industry. Front and center is Row 44, an in-fight internet provider that has recently added live TV and video-on-demand to the list of services it offers airlines. Rather than tune in to a seatback consol, passengers stream the content directly to their personal devices. ""You're going to see a lot more cases where airlines will opt not to invest in an imbedded in-fight entertainment system, and will say, 'let Samsung or HP do the investment,' in terms of letting people bring in their own devices,"" says John LaValle, CEO of Global Eagle Entertainment (of which Row 44 is a subsidiary). Row 44 has been nominated for a Crystal Cabin award for its work with Southwest Airlines, which last year became the first in the world to stream live television directly to passengers' WiFi-enabled devices. Previously, Southwest didn't have any form of in-flight entertainment. Says Katie McDonald, a spokeswoman for Southwest: . ""Not only did we save on the expense of installation and maintenance of seatbacks, but we're saving fuel by avoiding the added weight of the TV hardware."" Understandably, letting passengers bring their own devices on board is an attractive notion to low-cost carriers. In 2011, Air Baltic became the first European airline to offer customers iPads for in-fight entertainment. Like Southwest, they previously had no system in place. ""If you want to design something in your front seat, you have to go through a rigorous certification process,"" explains Janis Vanags, Air Baltic's vice president of corporate communications. ""You have to design it, produce it, install it; it takes years and it takes millions. By the time it's certified and installed, it's already old."" By comparison, he notes, portable devices ""can be put up fairy quickly, and can be changed quickly without a big investment."" Read more: Airlines cash in as Wi-Fi takes off . Unlike the many airlines that have since followed suit (Qantas, Thai Airways, Aeromexico and Jetstar, to name a few), Air Baltic ultimately dropped the program. Originally, they handed out the devices for free to business class customers, and rented them out for â‚¬9 ($11.55) to those in economy. ""We believe our airline is like a travel megastore, and as a result, we're not into amenities; we're into products and services that we can make money out of,"" admits Vanags, adding, ""we found that there was a very small, but negative gain from stocking the product."" Air Baltic seems to be atypical; Southwest Airlines, which charges passengers $5 to enjoy live TV, has witnessed an uptick in their revenue (though they declined to disclose how much). Any increase is impressive considering the service was only rolled out on a handful of planes, and had received no marketing. Furthermore, live TV has proved particularly popular with sports junkies, many of whom would have to otherwise make a tough choice between catching a game and booking a flight. Anticipating this, Row 44 has worked out a deal with America's National Football League, allowing passengers to never miss a game. ""There was a popular game between the Green Bay Packers and Chicago Bears at the start of the season,"" recalls LaValle. ""Live TV was only available on 25 planes, and not many passengers knew about it, and we still had 600 viewers. Football games last about three hours -- longer than the actual flight -- and still passengers were willing to pay to watch a game they knew they wouldn't catch the end of."" Some carriers, however, are happy to throw out iPads and live TV as an added perk. Emirates Airlines, which has long prided itself on amenities, last month started offering live TV to all passengers on its A380s, partly to promote Formula 1, of which the airline is a prominent sponsor. Similarly, Norwegian Air, another Row 44 customer, uses its free Wi-Fi offerings as a means to win customers (though they recently started charging for video-on-demand, which streams directly to passenger's devices). Read more: In-flight phone calls to become standard? ""It's a big part of their marketing strategy, and it's been very successful in getting them customers,"" admits LaValle, who points out the airline has even introduced the wireless symbol in their decal. Despite its many advantages, though, the content available to passengers on their own devices can be more limited than what's available on traditional seatbacks. In the last few years, it's become commonplace for airlines to offer what's known as ""early window"" content, or movies that are still showing in cinemas. At the moment, airlines that rely on passenger-owned devices are forced to eschew this service. ""At the end of the day, studios are always very wary of content protection, and making sure what content they do provide can't be abused or copied illegally"" notes Andrew Muirhead, the director of innovation at Lufthansa Technik, a subsidiary of Deutsche Lufthansa. ""Early window is high-value content, and they want to keep it in a very controlled environment,"" he notes. Muirhead acknowledges that this could change in the future, but says it's another example of why portable devices will never completely replace imbedded screens. ""Imagine a family of five turns up on a flight. What are the chances all of them will have an iPad? You still need to entertain people who don't have such devices on board.""","More airlines are using passengers' own tech to deliver in-flight entertainment .

"Washington (CNN) -- An election year that was already bad for incumbents is turning out to be worse than they could have ever imagined. An avalanche of crises -- ranging from the killer Ebola virus to ISIS jihadists to a suddenly volatile stock market -- is making it virtually impossible for lawmakers to rely on the inherent advantages of holding office. Instead of highlighting their accomplishments to constituents, incumbents are on defense. The growing troubles are upending plans for the final stretch before the Nov. 4 election that will determine which party will control the Senate. President Barack Obama was forced this week to scrap several campaign appearances to remain in Washington to oversee the Ebola response. The weeks before an election are often volatile but the challenges in this election cycle are particularly acute. ""Other midterms have taken place in chaotic times,"" said Julian Zelizer, a professor of history at Princeton University. ""Right now this is a pretty bad one. There are, rationally, a lot of problems that the president and the country are confronting."" Christopher Nicholas, a veteran Republican consultant in Pennsylvania, said the pain of current Democratic lawmakers reminded him of the ""six-year itch"" election when George W. Bush's unpopularity meant a ""thumpin"" for his party. ""October 2014 is starting to remind me of October 2006, which in my professional time was the worst cycle for Republicans, and the best for Democrats,"" Nicholas said. Back then, Bush's Republicans -- like Obama's Democrats -- couldn't catch a break. Powerless in the face of the sectarian explosion engulfing Iraq, and scarred by Hurricane Katrina, Bush limped into the elections and Democrats marched off with the Senate and the House of Representatives. Today, Democrats in tough elections don't want to be seen with Obama and Kentucky Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes won't even say if she voted for the president. The gloomy October is making it easier for Republicans to press their case against Obama and incumbent Democrats. ""This administration couldn't run the IRS right, and it apparently isn't running the CDC right,"" Mitt Romney told New Hampshire's NH-1 television station on Wednesday ""And you ask yourself what is it going to take to have a president who really focuses on the interests of the American people?"" Dire warnings about the threat from Ebola and the administration's response have been percolating on conservative talk radio for weeks. But it took the infection of two nurses to insert the issue into the midterms. In a Colorado Senate debate on Wednesday, GOP Rep. Cory Gardner demanded action amid Republican calls for a travel ban covering the epicenter of Ebola in West Africa. ""If the president is not willing to put into a place a travel ban, then we should have 100 percent screening of the people who are coming from those affected areas,"" Gardner said. Democratic Sen. Mark Udall, trailing Gardner in the Rocky Mountain state, hit back by accusing his opponent of complicity in budget cuts for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Potential Republican 2016 challengers are also pitching in, despite Obama's assurances that the chances of catching Ebola are ""extraordinarily"" low. ""The Obama administration has downplayed how transmissible it is,"" Senator Rand Paul said in an interview with CNN Thursday. ""If someone has Ebola at a cocktail party, they're contagious and you can catch it from them."" In an article for CNN.com, Marco Rubio laid out ""5 steps to beat Ebola."" ""This challenge will only be made more difficult because many Americans lack confidence in our government's ability to effectively confront crises like this one,"" he said. Few charges are as damaging for a president as the sense he has lost control and the cascade of dramas over the last six weeks or so has often left the White House struggling to catch up. The multiple crises have also played into a critique that the president is too passive and reacts to, rather than dictates, events. There is also trouble for the White House abroad in the run-up to the mid-terms and Republicans also see an opening against Obama and incumbent Democrats in the fight against ISIS. In one spot, New Hampshire senatorial candidate Scott Brown warned ""radical Islamic terrorists are threatening to cause the collapse of our country. President Obama and Senator Shaheen seem confused about the nature of the threat. Not me."" Meanwhile, stock market losses complicate Democratic attempts to highlight what good economic news there is out there — including increasingly robust jobs growth and a dip in the unemployment rate to 5.9 percent, the lowest level in six years. But despite being in the box seat in most Senate races, Republicans are hardly basking in popularity — a fact encouraging to Democrats as 2016 looms. The Republican brand is also battered, following gridlock in Congress and a government shutdown last year, and the unfinished tussle between the establishment and the Tea Party. ""The story of the Republican Party under Obama, no matter how many problems the president faces, is that they have consistently managed to shoot themselves in the foot,"" said Zelizer, who is also a CNN contributor.","Incumbents are playing defense as domestic and overseas crises mount.
President Obama had to cancel fundraisers this week to oversee the Ebola response.
Gloomy October makes it easier for Republicans to make their case against Democrats."
"(CNN) -- If he was unknown to the American public before, Tony Hayward is fast becoming a household name, answering rapid-fire questions about the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in newspaper stories and television shows. On Thursday, BP's chief executive officer hit the airwaves again. This time, with a carefully crafted message of his own: ""I'm sorry."" ""The Gulf spill is a tragedy that never should have happened,"" Hayward says in commercials that began airing on national television. "" ... BP has taken full responsibility for cleaning up the spill in the Gulf,"" he says. ""We've helped organize the largest environmental response in this country's history. More than 2 million feet of boom, 30 planes and over 1,300 boats are working to protect the shoreline. Where oil reaches the shore, thousands of people are ready to clean it up. We will honor all legitimate claims. And our cleanup efforts will not come at any cost to taxpayers. ""To those affected and your families, I am deeply sorry. The Gulf is home for thousands of BP's employees and we all feel the impact. To all the volunteers and for the strong support of the government, thank you. We know it is our responsibility to keep you informed. And do everything we can so this never happens again. We will get this done. We will make this right."" Hayward makes the same apology in full-page ads appearing in major daily newspapers, including The New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, USA Today and The Washington Post. The ads are part of BP's efforts to polish its tarnished image, but marketing experts aren't so sure anything will help just yet -- not with thousands of gallons of oil still gushing out of the ruptured BP well. ""At the end of the day, the best PR and advertising in the world cannot compete with that live video stream of that oil coming out of the bottom of the sea,"" Chris Gidez, a former oil company public relations man, told Advertising Age magazine. ""PR, advertising, community affairs, social media and communications is not going to solve the problem."" The beleaguered oil company's apology is certainly not stopping angry Americans who plan to begin a week of demonstrations Thursday in 50 cities nationwide. It also may be too late for residents of the Gulf Coast, who were already upset with Hayward after he told reporters Sunday that he ""would like his life back"" from the spill. Fishermen and shop owners affected by the spill took issue with what they perceived as a whine from the millionaire businessman. So Hayward issued yet another apology, this time on BP's Facebook page Wednesday afternoon. ""I made a hurtful and thoughtless comment on Sunday when I said that 'I wanted my life back,' "" Hayward said. ""When I read that recently, I was appalled. I apologize, especially to the families of the 11 men who lost their lives in this tragic accident. ""Those words don't represent how I feel about this tragedy, and certainly don't represent the hearts of the people of BP -- many of whom live and work in the Gulf -- who are doing everything they can to make things right. My first priority is doing all we can to restore the lives of the people of the Gulf region and their families -- to restore their lives, not mine.""","BP's top official apologizes in TV ads that began airing Thursday .

"Bangkok (CNN) -- Thai authorities have released 70 women and girls originally from Laos and Myanmar following a trafficking raid in southern Thailand. District police and Thai special investigators raided a karaoke bar and a spa Friday night, said Lt. Col. Noppadon Petsut, deputy police chief of Sadao district. Forty-one of the females released had been forced into prostitution, Petsut said. The other 29 were willfully working as prostitutes and were fined and released. Of those forced into prostitution, about 20 trafficking victims are under age 18, Petsut said. Thai police arrested five suspects -- three Thais, one Malaysian and one Singaporean, Petsut said. All were detained and charged with human trafficking and illegally allowing illegal migrants to stay in Thailand. The raid took place after the Department of Special Investigation received a call from the Laotian embassy in Bangkok saying there were Laotians being forced into prostitution, Petsut said.","Police say the females are from Laos and Myanmar .

"Washington (CNN) -- This week, Coca-Cola and Kraft announced they are pulling their corporate memberships from a conservative group that was behind the spread of ""stand your ground"" laws like the one highlighted in Florida by the Trayvon Martin case. The American Legislative Executive Council, also known as ALEC, is getting attention lately for its behind the scenes work pushing conservative legislation in the states. The group has gotten even more attention since a neighborhood watch volunteer shot and killed unarmed teenager Martin last month. The man who shot Martin, George Zimmerman, said he acted in self-defense. Police haven't charged him and legal experts say Florida's ""stand your ground"" law may shield Zimmerman from prosecution. The National Rifle Association worked with ALEC to spread similar laws that are on the books in at least 25 states. Those laws grow directly out of the Second Amendment ethos the NRA has championed: ""the ethos of individualism, of having a gun, of individuals taking the initiative,"" said Robert Spitzer, a political scientist at the State University of New York at Cortland and at Cornell University who has studied and written about the NRA for decades. Opinion: When soda pop and politics don't mix . Less well known is that the NRA has also helped ALEC spread other conservative laws that have nothing to do with gun rights. ALEC drafts and shares model bills with state legislators to promote corporation-friendly and conservative social policy. A watchdog group called the Center for Media and Democracy first documented the NRA's role in these bills with ALEC. An NRA lobbyist, Tara Mica, helped shepherd a model bill that requires voters to show a photo ID at the polls. Many conservatives have pushed voter ID laws to prevent election fraud. Many liberals say these laws inhibit voting by minorities. Mica also helped preside over ALEC's passage of the model bill that became the basis of Arizona's immigration law. That's the law that requires police to arrest anyone who cannot prove when asked that they entered the United States legally. The NRA and Mica wouldn't talk with CNN, so it's not known whether Mica consulted with other NRA officials about the bills on voter ID and immigration. ALEC also declined to answer questions. Lisa Graves with the Center for Media and Democracy said the way ALEC works, ""We know a bill cannot be approved as a model bill if the private sector members, like the NRA or Walmart, don't want it to become a model bill."" Josh Horwitz heads an advocacy group called the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. He said the NRA's role with ALEC cements his view that the NRA is really a base for the conservative movement. ""People think the NRA is just a gun group. It's really not."" Horwitz said. Horwitz's group has created a cheeky website, ""Meet the NRA.org."" It lists the NRA's board of directors, and it has a rolling information bar that features some of their more colorful statements. The NRA's board includes Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, and David Keene, former chairman of the American Conservative Union. The board also includes Robert Brown, creator of Soldier of Fortune magazine, and rock guitarist Ted Nugent. Spitzer said the NRA has gotten involved in some other non-gun issues. For instance, he said, the NRA fought hard against campaign finance reform in the days of McCain-Feingold. ""They were taking a very much free-enterprise, government-hands-off-the-campaign-process (approach),"" he said. But Spitzer said the NRA will always be primarily about guns and what they stand for in the individualist American mythology. He said the NRA's work is cut out for it, because gun ownership is on the decline in America.","American Legislative Executive Council getting attention for pushing conservative legislation .

"Washington (CNN) -- The inspector general who reported Internal Revenue Service targeting of conservative groups said Thursday that he didn't have information until last week that the word ""progressive"" also was on a list of criteria for extra scrutiny of tax-exempt applications. At a hearing of the House Oversight Committee, Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration J. Russell George said the information that liberal groups also were probably targeted only came to him July 9. His audit, released in May, cited criteria including ""tea party"" and other conservative-themed words or labels that were used to decide whether applicants for tax-exempt status should come under further review. Since then, an investigation by the panel turned up documents that showed IRS workers also were told to look for the liberal-themed label. ""They were not provided during our audit, even though similar documents that list quote 'tea party' unquote but not 'progressive' were,"" George said. ""I am very disturbed that these documents were not provided to our auditors at the outset, and we are currently reviewing this issue."" The IRS targeting revealed by George's audit in May led to accusations by Republicans that the Obama administration could be using the tax agency's powers against political enemies. Democrats have rejected such allegations and insisted that liberal groups also were targeted. Last week, the top Democrat on the House committee questioned why George's audit had not included information on liberal groups being targeted. Thursday's hearing was the first time George issued a public response to the criticism by Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland. ""We just learned recently that name was being used by the Internal Revenue Service,"" George said of the term ""progressive."" George's audit indicated that lax oversight at the IRS allowed for the singling out of some conservative groups starting in 2010 and continuing until last year. In particular, the report said IRS workers in the tax-exempt unit used ""Be on the Lookout"" or BOLO lists of words such as ""tea party"" to assess what applicants came under extra scrutiny that delayed decisions for months and even years. However, it also said no evidence existed that the targeting was politically motivated. George subsequently testified at previous hearings that he could not specifically identify whether any liberal groups were similarly targeted. However, Cummings said information made public last week showed that George, who was appointed in 2004 by GOP President George W. Bush, was aware that liberal groups also were targeted. On Thursday, George and other officials in the inspector general's office said the audit focused on the BOLO list that included conservtive labels. George expressed frustration over how the issue has unfolded, at one point saying: ""This is not a clean-cut matter. There's a lot going on here."" Earlier at Thursday's hearing, two career IRS employees shot down the central premise of committee Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa's argument that the agency's targeting scandal was politically motivated. Asked repeatedly whether they knew of anyone at the IRS with political motives to obstruct applications for tax-exempt status by conservative groups, the pair told the panel ""no."" Issa himself asked the question early on in the committee's third hearing on the issue, as did others from both parties amid bitter exchanges that focused attention on the political squabbling instead of the targeting cited by George's report. Cummings challenged Issa on past comments suggesting that White House involvement in the targeting showed it was a weapon against political enemies of President Barack Obama. ""This is unsubstantiated nonsense,"" Cummings said, adding that it undermined the integrity of the committee. For his part, Issa insisted that the testimony from IRS veterans Elizabeth Hofacre and Carter Hull established that IRS officials in Washington played a major role in the targeting. The problem was broader than the earlier claim by Democrats that it was limited to the agency's Cincinnati office that handles tax-exempt applications, Issa said. ""We can today debunk the accusation that Cincinnati was, in fact, the story and that it never went to Washington, which it clearly did,"" the California Republican said. However, his case was deflated by the unwavering insistence by Hofacre and Hull that they were unaware of any political motivation in the targeting or any influence from outside the IRS on extra scrutiny that delayed responses to applications. The hearing followed a series of accusatory memos and news releases by both sides as the IRS targeting issue descended further into a purely partisan spitting match. Issa sent the IRS a letter Wednesday that made new demands for all communications on the matter between the tax agency, the Treasury Department and Obama's office since February 2010. The letter, signed by Issa and other House Republicans, quoted excerpts of an interview with Hull that said the office of the IRS chief counsel -- who was appointed by Obama in 2009 -- played a role in scrutiny that delayed processing tax-exempt applications from some conservative groups. ""Its involvement and demands for information about political activity during the 2010 election cycle appears to have caused systematic delays in the processing of tea party applications,"" the GOP letter said. In response, Cummings issued his own letter that accused Issa of dishonest intentions. IRS interviews show no political bias, Democrats say . ""Rather than describing the whole truth, your letter appears yet again to create a skewed account based on partial, incomplete, and cherry-picked information while disregarding key evidence that contradicts your political narrative,"" Cummings wrote. A day earlier, Cummings released a memo that cited excerpts from committee interviews with 15 IRS workers that found no evidence of political bias or White House manipulation alleged by Republicans. ""Despite an extremely aggressive investigation involving thousands of documents and more than a dozen interviews of IRS employees, the overwhelming evidence before the committee reveals no political motivation or White House involvement in this process,"" said the memo written by the committee's Democratic staff. Issa conceded in an opinion piece published Wednesday on the USA Today website that the two-month investigation has yet to find hard evidence of involvement in the targeting by anyone outside the IRS. He argued that the lack of proof does not mean the investigation should end. ""We candidly still don't have clear answers to many important questions and have yet to begin interviewing senior IRS officials,"" Issa wrote, saying ""judgment should be withheld until all relevant witnesses are interviewed and all documents reviewed."" Dems highlight IRS targeting of other groups . In an editorial Thursday, USA Today questioned the value of the ongoing investigation. ""No political operatives from the Obama campaign or the White House have been linked to any of the IRS' activities,"" the editorial said. ""What's more, it has become increasingly clear that confusion on the part of IRS employees, rather than a starkly political motive, was the primary cause of the delays."" At times during Thursday's hearing, Issa took a conciliatory stance, saying that any evidence of targeting -- whether of liberal or conservative groups -- should be investigated. ""If the facts are that people got abused for myriad reasons, we ought to know it,"" Issa said. Both Issa and Cummings asked George to provide more information on groups targeted by the IRS, and the inspector general pledged to do so. Cummings and other Democrats took aim Thursday at past statements by Issa and other Republicans, calling them blatantly political accusations with no basis in fact that went against the spirit of Issa's call at the start of Thursday's hearing to ""reject, categorically, assumptions for which there is not evidence."" Rep. Gerald Connolly, a Virginia Democrat, called for Issa to retract his earlier comments that the targeting involved only conservative groups and was an effort to target Obama's political enemies. Issa responded that tea party groups that came under extra scrutiny could be considered political enemies of the president and that he had yet to see hard evidence that liberal groups were targeted. Conservative group takes IRS, top Obama officials to court . Republicans made a point Thursday of singling out White House spokesman Jay Carney for criticism, noting he previously said that the targeting involved rogue IRS employees in Cincinnati. Hofacre described herself as offended by the characterization of the issue as misdeeds at her level. She and Hull said the delays in rendering final decisions on applications by conservative groups was because of a lack of guidance from superiors in Washington. Under tax law and IRS regulations, groups that primarily engage in political activity are ineligible for tax-exempt status. The targeting occurred after the 2010 ruling by the Supreme Court that opened the political process to more private contributions from business and labor, leading to increased applications for tax-exempt status from groups involved in political activity. In the memo Cummings made public Tuesday, IRS employees who identified themselves as Republicans, Democrats and independents said there was no political motivation or outside influence involved in the agency's handling of tax-exempt requests from groups with possible or likely political affiliations. According to the memo, an IRS tax law specialist based in Washington who described herself as Republican said ""no, not at all"" when asked whether there was any evidence that the agency targeted Obama's political enemies. ""That's kind of laughable that people think that,"" the memo quoted the woman as saying. Cummings and other Democrats complained Thursday that the other IRS employees who had been interviewed were not called as witnesses to the latest hearing.

"(CNN) -- A school district member in Arkansas who came under fire for an anti-gay post on a social networking site formally submitted his resignation to the school board Monday, according to the Midland School District superintendent. The board unanimously voted at a specially called meeting to accept Clint McCance's resignation, Superintendent Dean Stanley said. McCance, then vice president of the school district in Pleasant Plains, wrote on his personal Facebook page that he wanted gay people to commit suicide, according to The Advocate, a newspaper focusing on gay news. McCance used the terms ""queer"" and ""fag"" repeatedly, promised to disown his own children if they are gay and stated that he enjoys ""the fact that [gay people] give each other AIDS and die."" In his typed, one-paragraph resignation letter, McCance said that he ""did not represent my school or my position well in my statements on line"" and that he was ""sorry for all the trouble it has caused the school district and those people that I love in this school system."" ""I hope this resignation will help things get back to normal for you,"" he wrote. ""At no time did I want anyone to hurt themselves. I do not support bullying. I do not wish harm on anyone. I always learn from my mistakes and I hope that all of you learned something from this experience. ""I am a better person today than I was a week ago, I promise you. I wish nothing but the best for you all, and may God bless this school district."" McCance appeared on CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" on Thursday night, apologizing for the comments and saying that he planned to resign. ""I'm sorry I've hurt people with my comments,"" McCance said. ""I'm sorry I made those ignorant comments and hurt people on a broad spectrum."" Though he disapproves of homosexuality, McCance said, ""I give everyone a chance and try to love everyone."" McCance said he has received an outpouring of criticism over his comments, including ""thousands of phone calls, hate mails, people threatening to kill my family and me."" He said that he has sent his wife and two kids out of the state because of fears for their safety and that he is installing a security system at his home. ""I'm reaping what I've sown,"" he said. ""I've had a lot of hate speech thrown at me and my family on every level."" His comments had drawn criticism from education officials in his district and at the state level. ""I strongly condemn the statements that appeared on Mr. Clint McCance's Facebook page,"" Tom Kimbrell, Arkansas' commissioner of education, said in a statement Wednesday. ""The statements attributed to Mr. McCance constitute a . significant departure from statements we expect from our school leaders. The divisiveness and disruption of these comments cause me to seriously question the ability of Mr. McCance to remain as an effective member of the Midland School Board."" McCance was re-elected for a four-year term in September. He was initially elected to the leadership of the school district in 2007 for a three-year term. The terms are now four years long. The Midland School District had also denounced the posting. ""The district strives to foster an environment that discourages all forms of bullying,"" it said in a statement this week, ""and an environment that encourages a safe and productive educational climate [for] all of our students. The district is very diligent in pursuing and addressing bullying of any variety on our campuses."" The state Department of Education had said it was ""dismayed to see that a school board official would post something of this insensitive nature on a public forum like Facebook."" Because McCance's Facebook page is not accessible publicly, the Advocate said it learned about the posts after being provided with a screen shot. The posts were made, according to The Advocate, in response to a bullying awareness campaign sponsored by GLAAD, the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. CNN's David Mattingly contributed to this report.","NEW: Clint McCance: ""I am a better person today than I was a week ago""

"(Rolling Stone) -- At one point in ""Celebration Day,"" the new film of Led Zeppelin's 2007 reunion concert in London, the camera stays long and tight on Jimmy Page's hands as they execute the introduction to ""Stairway to Heaven"" on the six-string neck of his double-neck Gibson guitar. It is one of rock's most iconic riffs, played in full and close-up by the composer, at one of his band's greatest and most important shows. ""With Led Zeppelin, it has always been that mystique of how the music is done -- how it works, why it works,"" Page says on the phone from London a couple of weeks before Celebration Day's worldwide theatrical premiere on October 17th. ""The closer you can get in on that and the more lingering it is, the better."" ""Celebration Day,"" which will be commercially released in various audio and visual formats on November 19, is nothing more or less than Zeppelin's entire two-hour performance on December 10, 2007, at London's O2 Arena. The concert, a benefit and tribute to the late Atlantic Records chief Ahmet Ertegun, was the first full Zeppelin show by Page, singer Robert Plant and bassist John Paul Jones since the death of drummer John Bonham in 1980. Bonham's son, Jason, took his father's place for the night, which is shown without backstage footage and includes minimal shots of the ecstatic audience. Instead, director Dick Carruthers -- who shot the concert with more than a dozen cameras -- provides extended close-ups of the band members in action: Plant in bluestrance moan during ""Since I've Been Loving You""; Jones threading the folk-rock gallop of ""Ramble On"" with low-end countermelodies; everyone turning to Jason in admiration during his volcanic solo at the end of ""Rock and Roll."" ""Celebration Day"" is ""almost like being onstage with us,"" Jones says. ""We always had that interaction,"" he adds, referring to Zeppelin's legendary concert prowess in the Seventies. ""But nobody could see it, because the lighting wasn't there."" Before the O2 show, Jones notes, ""I remember Dick saying in one of the early meetings, 'I'm going to need 14 cameras.' Everybody went, 'What?' It paid off."" Page recalls walking off stage after the reunion concert feeling ""really high. That's the truth. It was a serious test, and we passed it, all of us. And we had an extraordinary communion on the stage. That's alive and well when you see it."" But it was quite a while -- Page can't remember how long -- before he saw a rough cut of Carruthers' footage (""We didn't rush into the editing suite to have it out for Christmas""). In fact, Plant and Jones viewed that cut first. ""We came away raving,"" Jones says. ""It was very fitting to the experience. We called Jimmy and said, 'You've gotta see this.'"" The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time: Led Zeppelin . ""The thing about Led Zeppelin was that it was always four musicians at the top of their game, but they could play like a band,"" Page says. ""Even in the first couple of rehearsal days, running up to the O2, we were playing pretty good. But we really wanted to shine as a band."" He cites the set list's opening sequence -- from the surprise opener, ""Good Times Bad Times,"" from 1969's Led Zeppelin, into ""Ramble On"" and the tortuous crunch of ""Black Dog."" ""I wanted people to feel, 'They're taking this seriously.' ""And I have to tell you, the rehearsals were all quite different,"" Page says, ""so much in that Zeppelin spirit and character."" To prove it, a deluxe edition of the DVD will include footage from the band's only full-scale production rehearsal before the O2 concert. ""You get the urgency of that night, but also the determination that was in rehearsal."" Inevitably, Celebration Day has set off more reunion talk. At a London press conference announcing the film, Plant raved about the O2 performance: ""To get back in the middle of that music was a spectacular experience."" But he and Page evaded questions about additional shows. When asked if the movie marks the end of Zeppelin, once and for all, Jones -- who is busy writing an opera and collaborating with Robyn Hitchcock and the Norwegian group Supersilent -- responds, ""When I move house, I never look back at the house and go, 'Oh, that's the last moment I'll see there.' I always move forward."" ""That's a good answer,"" Page says, laughing. But he is more direct. ""I think if there had been any more concerts to be done, we'd already be talking about them. So I don't see it."" Celebration Day, he adds, ""is a testament to what we did in 2007. There it is."" Copyright © 2011 Rolling Stone.","""Celebration Day"" will be commercially released on November 19 .
It's nothing more or less than Zeppelin's two-hour performance on December 10, 2007 .
""Celebration Day"" is ""almost like being onstage with us,"" Jones says ."
"SPRINGFIELD, Illinois (CNN) -- It wasn't long after the Illinois state Senate voted unanimously to remove Democratic Gov. Rod Blagojevich from office that Lt. Gov. Patrick Quinn put his hand on a Bible and took the oath of office to replace him. New Gov. Patrick Quinn says he hopes ""to restore the faith of the people of Illinois."" Quinn, a 60-year-old tax attorney, has spent most of the last 27 years in public office. On Thursday, he took up his greatest challenge yet. ""In this moment our hearts are hurt,"" Quinn said after the swearing in. ""It is very important that all of us understand that we have a duty, a mission, to restore the faith of the people of Illinois in the integrity of our government and to make sure that all of our elected officials have the confidence of the voters. ""I think this is our highest calling,"" he said. ""I think that is what we have to do in the coming days."" Blagojevich was arrested in December on federal corruption charges. Federal authorities allege, among other things, that he was trying to sell or trade the Senate seat that became vacant after Barack Obama was elected president. ""When I woke up on the morning of December 9, it was quite a shock, I think for all of the people of Illinois,"" Quinn said, ""And I think it is something that you have to accustom yourself to. But I'm an organizer. Early to bed, early to rise, organize, organize, organize and that's what we've got to do for Illinois for everyday people."" Quinn, a Democrat, was elected to the office of lieutenant governor in 2002 and was re-elected in 2006. ""His priorities include advocating for taxpayers and consumers, protecting the environment, promoting decent health care, and helping members of the armed services and their families,"" his official Web site said. He served a term as Illinois state treasurer from 1991 to 1995, leaving office after an unsuccessful campaign for secretary of state in 1994. Quinn waged another losing campaign in 1996 when Dick Durbin beat him in the Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate seat opened by the retirement of Sen. Paul Simon. Durbin went on to win the seat and is now Illinois' senior senator. His political career began in Chicago in 1982, when Quinn, then a practicing tax attorney, was elected Commissioner of the Cook County Board of (Property) Tax Appeals. He later served as Chicago's revenue director. Quinn, who is divorced, has two sons. He grew up in Hinsdale, Illinois, but now lives in Chicago. Quinn called for Blagojevich to step down in the weeks after his arrest and supported the Illinois House of Representatives when it voted to impeach the embattled governor. On Thursday, he said the state's elected representatives carried out their duties faithfully. ""I want to say to the people of Illinois, the ordeal is over,"" he said. ""The citizens of Illinois can be extremely proud of our elected representatives in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, the senators who today carried out their responsibilities with serious purpose and due process. ""I think the people of the land of Lincoln are very, very proud of our elected representatives, who reflected the will of the people.""","Illinois Lt. Gov.

"Washington (CNN) -- The United States and Japan have agreed that about half the U.S. Marines on the Japanese island of Okinawa will soon leave, a transition that could ease a long-simmering resentment of the Americans' presence that has at times boiled over. The news from a joint U.S.-Japanese committee comes as Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Nodo prepares to meet Monday with President Barack Obama in Washington. ""I am very pleased that, after many years, we have reached this important agreement and plan of action,"" Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said, noting the lengthy seesaw talks aimed at cutting the American presence on the island south of Tokyo. About 9,000 Marines and their family members will leave Okinawa, the U.S.-Japan Security Consultative Committee said Thursday. About 5,000 will go to Guam as part of a much larger U.S. military build up in Asia, a realignment that comes amid China's rapid growth as a major economic and military power. The U.S. military presence on Okinawa has caused considerable controversy. Some have complained about noise from the base, in an urban area. Many others were incensed by the misconduct of U.S. troops stationed there, including the 1995 rape of 12-year-old Japanese girl by three U.S. military personnel. Opposition to the presence of U.S. troops in Okinawa runs so deep that it contributed to the resignation of former Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama in 2010. He had promised to move the base but later announced that the base would stay, a decision he called ""heartbreaking."" His critics said then that he gave in to U.S. pressure, and his government coalition broke up. ""Recognizing the strong desires of Okinawa residents, these relocations are to be completed as soon as possible while ensuring operational capability throughout the process,"" the U.S.-Japan Security Consultative Committee . Japan's foreign minister, Koichiro Genba, called the agreement satisfactory. U.S. military personnel by country . ""It's forward-looking and meaningful, one that can act upon the changing security environment as well as reducing the burden on Okinawa,"" Genba said Friday morning. Of the Marines being transferred, about 2,700 will be sent to Hawaii and still others will rotate through a base in Darwin, Australia. The relocations are in line with President Barack Obama's goal to have the military have a geographically distributed presence in the Pacific. The transfer leaves between 9,000 and 10,000 Marines belonging to the 3rd Marine Expeditionary Force on Okinawa. ""So, in the end, we are sustaining the same presence in the western Pacific that we've intended for some time,"" said a senior U.S. defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity as a matter of routine during a briefing with reporters. Okinawa was the site of the last major campaign for U.S. forces in the Pacific during World War II. The Battle of Okinawa lasted from March through June 1945. More than 100,000 civilians, 100,000 Japanese troops and 12,000 Americans were believed to have died in the fighting for the island chain, roughly 1,000 miles south of Tokyo. After the United States defeated Japan in World War II, a U.S. occupation force remained in Okinawa and other parts of the country. Japan regained control of the islands in 1972. During the Cold War, the United States military presence on Okinawa served as a bulwark against communism in a strategic location during the Vietnam War. More recently, the United States has kept its forces in Okinawa and increased its military footprint across Asia as China rises as a major economic and military power. Much of the U.S. assistance to Japan after last year's earthquake was launched from Okinawa bases. The friction between locals and military personnel has been exacerbated in recent years by cultural misunderstandings and the isolated criminal acts. It's hoped the reduction of forces on the island chain will reduce the animosity. The call for the U.S. military to leave Okinawa escalated after the 1995 rape of the 12-year-old, a crime that outraged the Japanese and led to calls by many that American troops leave. In 1996, spurred in part by Japanese anger on Okinawa, Washington and Tokyo signed an agreement to reduce the amount of land being occupied by U.S. forces. About 40,000 U.S. personnel are based in Japan, and more than three-quarters of the military bases are on Okinawa. At its height, U.S. military operations on Okinawa accounted for about 20 percent of the land use on the island chain. In 2006, the United States and Japan reached an agreement that would have relocated thousands of Marines off the island once the Marine Corps Air Station at Futenma was closed and moved to Camp Schwab on Okinawa. That plan stalled after widespread protests over the proposed location and costs for the new air base. Futenma is not addressed under the agreement announced Thursday to move the Marines. ""I think what we've done with the agreement is ... to create the political space for the government of Japan to move this forward on its own timeline,"" the defense official said. As part of the agreement, the United States will begin returning lands on Okinawa in phases as the Marines depart. Part of the $8.6 billion cost to relocate the Marines from Okinawa to Guam will be picked up by Japan, which has agreed to pay $3.1 billion, the Security Committee statement said. Bob Kovach reported from Washington, Chelsea J. Carter from Atlanta. CNN's Phil Gast, Greg Botelho and Yoko Wakatsuki contributed to this report.","About 9,000 Marines will be moved off Okinawa, a U.S.-Japan committee says .

"(CNN) -- What's the first foreign policy issue the next U.S. president should tackle after the election? More than 1,000 aspiring foreign secretaries in 114 countries and territories around the world weighed in on CNN International's latest Facebook survey to give us their answer. Vote now on Facebook: What should be top U.S. foreign policy task? The verdict: 45% of voters said America's post-Arab Spring policies should be the top foreign policy priority for either Barack Obama or Mitt Romney. This mirrors the week's biggest story -- violent protests in Egypt and Libya that resulted in the storming of U.S. diplomatic buildings following the publication on YouTube of an amateur film portraying the Prophet Mohammed in a negative light. More: Facebook CNN Election Insights tool . The attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi on Tuesday led to the death of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, and by Friday the protests had spread to at least eight other countries. Our Facebook survey also reflects lingering worries about the European debt crisis: 21% of respondents said America's top task should be to address the crisis that threatens to undermine the euro. Nearly one in five (18.5%) believe sorting out relations with China should be the next president's first order of business. But just one in 10 people see Iranian and North Korean nuclear proliferation as the top priority. More: Latest updates at CNN's Election Center . And last but not least, just one in 20 people (4.7%) chose fighting al Qaeda as the number one foreign policy for the U.S. president -- despite the fact al Qaeda militants and associates are now fighting for influence from Mali to Pakistan. Last week's Facebook survey (insert link) was dominated by men (75%), and this week even more so: four out of five (80%) who cast votes in our foreign policy survey were male.

"(CNN) -- As location-based apps go, Foursquare or Gowalla will work just fine if you're looking for the spot where all your buddies are having a beer. But what if they discovered an awesome, out-of-the-way spot six months ago? Or, better yet, what if you didn't even know you were looking for a watering hole until your phone told you there's one around the corner you shouldn't miss? As the novelty of the simple check-in fades, and the abilities of GPS-based location technology expand, some new mobile apps -- call them ""discovery apps"" -- are looking to parlay mobile ""noise"" into useful, place-based tips. ""It feels like the paradigm shift in the late '90s when Google came along,"" said Babak Pahlavan, CEO of Cleversense, which released the app Alfred this month. ""There's an information overload -- to find something useful for you is a very daunting task. It's time for a new shift; it's time to make sense of it and make it useful for you."" Alfred has been called ""Pandora for the real world."" Users feed it information about their favorite places (mainly restaurants, bars and coffee shops). Then, theoretically, Alfred -- a mustachioed robot butler -- can suggest similar spots that are nearby, no matter where you are. The free app, currently on Apple's iOS system, with Android and Windows Phone versions in the works, was rolled out this month and took top honors in the ""Startup Idol"" contest at the Fortune Brainstorm Tech conference in Aspen, Colorado. The app, which was two years in the making, uses a Web-crawling algorithm to pull the information together and, according to Pahlavan, recognized the difference between positive and negative chatter about a place. ""There's so much information on the Web, but it's all scattered,"" he said. ""You almost need an assistant or chaperone to go out and find things to figure out what matters to you."" If Cleversense's app relies on software, Trover, co-created by the founder of travel site Expedia, is fueled by other folks and their cell phones. Unveiled Thursday after three months in trial mode, Trover is a photography app. But its similarities to hot tools like Instagram or Hipstamatic end there. Instead, it's about documenting your discoveries, from a cool statue to an out-of-the-way restaurant to the best spot to view the surrounding scenery. Rich Barton, the Expedia founder and a Microsoft alum who also founded real-estate site Zillow, said he and Trover CEO Jason Karas are both avid travelers. ""And we've been brainstorming for years to figure out a way that we could carry with us, as we went, all our friends' recommendations on what to do, where to go and what to see,"" he said. ""Wouldn't it be great if we had a little voice whispering, 'Take a right there' ... or 'Hey, you're passing the best gelato place in Rome.' "" Using GPS on a smartphone (currently just the iPhone, but with an Android version in the works), the app shows users photos that other people have taken in the area. Apps like Yelp! already let users search for restaurants or other destinations. But Trover's founders say their app does something else. ""People that are using Trover now ... say Trover has become part of the rotation of apps that they use -- Trover combined with Yelp! and Foursquare and Instagram,"" Karas said. ""With Trover, it's really a different kind of experience. It's really built more around exploration than targeted search. As you travel around a neighborhood, you can have these serendipitous kinds of experiences."" Used Friday at CNN's Atlanta offices, the app rendered images of folks standing beside the giant CNN logo, spots in Centennial Olympic Park, concert footage from nearby venue The Tabernacle and even a buffalo head on the wall of a Ted's Montana Grill restaurant. With about 70,000 users who've found the app despite it being in stealth mode, the founders have already seen it used in an unexpected way: by street artists and their fans. ""That's two groups that have never really been able to get together, and they're getting together on Trover,"" Barton said. Users can, of course, create their own ""troves"" by taking and uploading pictures of their own. Trover and Alfred aren't the only new apps geared, at least in part, to place-based discovery. Broadcastr lets people upload audio files to an interactive map. Crowdbeacon lets users send questions to nearby users and tap into comments from other mobile apps about surrounding locations. ""With these new (GPS) sensors, it's all new data,"" Pahlavan said. ""It's about making sense out of it for you, and these new technologies that are forming are about taking all these data points and aggregating it to make it more useful for you.""","As location technology grows, mobile apps are trending toward ""discovery""

"New York (CNN) -- In courtroom packed with the victims' relatives and friends -- many with eyes swollen from crying -- a New York judge broke down in tears Monday as she sentenced the already-imprisoned ""Dating Game Killer"" to 25 years to life for the murders of two 23-year-old women in the 1970s. Rodney Alcala -- already on death row in California after being convicted of strangling four women and a 12-year-old-girl there -- now faces two new 25-to-life sentences for the grisly murders of the New York women. The California murders took place between November 1977 and June 1979, and crime scenes dotted a wide swath of suburban Los Angeles, from Burbank to El Segundo. ""This kind of case, I have never experienced, and I hope to never again,"" Judge Bonnie Wittner said between bouts of tears in Manhattan Criminal Court Monday. Alcala, 69, pleaded guilty last December to the murder of Cornelia Crilley, who was killed in New York in June 1971, and the murder of Ellen Hover, whose body was found in Westchester County in 1977. Crilley's younger sister, Katie Stigell, spoke on behalf of the family in the courtroom Monday, and remembered her sister as a beautiful girl with a wonderful personality who ""loved roses, daisies, and most of all, laughing."" ""She had her father's blue eyes and sense of humor,"" an emotional Stigell said. ""To think that smile of hers, that you were the last to see it,"" Stigell said directly to Alcala, who was present in court for the sentencing Monday. ""It's not about you today, it's about her,"" Stigell added. Dozens of Crilley's family members packed the courthouse wearing stickers printed with the young girl's face on it and a message that read, ""Cornelia always in our hearts."" Crilley, a 23-year-old TWA flight attendant, was found raped and strangled inside her Upper East Side apartment in June 1971, the Manhattan district attorney's office said in a news release at the time of the indictment in January 2011. Hover, also 23 and living in Manhattan, was found dead in Westchester County in 1977, the 2011 news release said. Hover's sister, Charlotte Rosenberg, described her beloved big sister as someone who ""chose to see the good in everyone she met because she had such a huge and open heart,"" in a victim impact statement read in court by an assistant district attorney. Rosenberg and her sister, Victoria Rudolph, chose not to attend the sentencing, but said they were grateful to submit an impact statement on behalf of their family. ""She was a talented painter and pianist and dreamed of going to medical school,"" Rosenberg wrote about her sister. Rosenberg wanted to make the distinction that her sister was not an heiress, as some news accounts at the time had indicated, but that her father planted the story to ensure that local and national papers continued to cover Hover's disappearance until she could be found. ""She was an amazing big sister...so dedicated to the entire family,"" Rosenberg wrote. ""It is my hope that the swift conclusion of these cases brings closure to the Crilley and Hover families, who have spent decades awaiting justice and now have been spared the pain of trial,"" Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. said at a news conference following the sentencing Monday. Relatives and friends of Hover and Crilley thanked the prosecutor's cold case unit for its efforts in bringing an end to their suffering. Assistant District Attorney Alex Spiro methodically read Alcala's ""chronology of carnage"" to a hushed courtroom. In 1978, Alcala was a winning bachelor on the television show ""The Dating Game."" At the time, he had been convicted in the 1968 rape of an 8-year-old girl and served a 34-month sentence, authorities said. A year before his appearance on the game show, Alcala raped, sodomized and killed 18-year-old Jill Barcomb and 27-year-old nurse Georgia Wixted in California, prosecutors said. During his appearance on ""The Dating Game,"" Alcala was introduced as a ""successful photographer"" who might also be found skydiving or motorcycling. In June 1979, Alcala beat, raped and strangled Charlotte Lamb, a 33-year-old legal secretary, in the laundry room of her El Segundo apartment complex, authorities said. That same month, he raped and murdered Jill Parenteau, 21, strangling her with a cord or a stocking in her Burbank apartment, they said. Alcala's blood was collected from the scene after he cut himself crawling out a window, the prosecutor said, adding, ""Based on a semi-rare blood match, Alcala was linked to the murder."" He was charged with murdering Parenteau, but the case was dismissed after he was convicted of killing 12-year-old Robin Samsoe, also in 1979. Alcala approached the girl at the beach in Huntington Beach, California, and asked her to pose for pictures, authorities said. She did, they said, and Alcala then kidnapped and murdered her, dumping her body in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains. Alcala was convicted in Samsoe's killing in 1980 and sentenced to death, but the California Supreme Court subsequently overturned his conviction. A second trial, in 1986, also resulted in a death sentence, but it was overturned by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. As he awaited a third trial, Alcala's DNA was linked to the crime scenes in the Barcomb, Wixted and Lamb cases, and he was charged with killing them and Parenteau. Jed Mills, who was ""Bachelor No. 2"" on ""The Dating Game"" alongside Alcala's ""Bachelor No. 1,"" recalled that he had an almost immediate aversion to him. ""Something about him, I could not be near him,"" Mills said last year. Alcala succeeded in charming bachelorette Cheryl Bradshaw from the other side of the game show's wall. But she declined the date that the show offered them: tennis lessons, tennis clothes and a trip to an amusement park. CNN's Jesse Solomon, Jason Kessler, Chris Kokenes and Ann O'Neill contributed to this report.","Rodney Alcala is already on California's death row, convicted of killing 4 women and a girl .

"(CNN) -- The boom in high-quality digital cameras in smartphones and tablets has also created an overwhelming glut of digital images scattered across devices and services. The latest company to try and tackle the problem of mountains of digital photos is cloud-storage service Dropbox, which released a new photo and video app called Carousel that should be available in the Android and iOS app stores later Wednesay. The free app is supposed to act as central repository and gallery in the cloud for all your images. Carousel was just one of a handful of announcements Dropbox made at an event in San Francisco on Wednesday. It is rolling out Android and beta Mac desktop versions of its Mailbox application, a tool for organizing unwieldy inboxes with snooze buttons, swipes and folders. Dropbox for Business is coming out of a limited beta and users can now have two separate Dropbox accounts -- one for their personal belongings and one for business documents. It packs in features that will make IT departments happy, such as remote wipes and audit logs. The company also announced that former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will be joining its board. For regular users, Carousel is the probably the most exciting new product. Digital photos are often stored across multiple social networks, computers, hard drives and mobile devices. Other services have tried to solve the issue in the past with middling success, such as Apple's Photo Stream. Dropbox might be in a better position to bring together content from multiple devices and operating systems, and it's already used by 275 million people. Carousel brings together any images stored on Dropbox with shots taken on an Android or iOS device. It backs up the full-sized images taken on mobile devices to Dropbox. The apps sorts them by date and location and includes tools for sharing images in a conversation with friends, and saving images they share with you to your Dropbox. It was already possible to automatically back up images taken on mobile phones to Dropbox, but the Carousel app is a new, nicely designed way to sort through those images. It frees up space on smartphones and tablets but counts towards the allotted 2 gigabytes of free space on individual Dropbox account. Anyone can buy more space from the service.","Cloud-storage service Dropbox has a new app for organizing photos called Carousel .

"(CNN) -- Pretty much any smartphone you buy in 2013 will have the same basic features: Internet access, e-mail, downloadable apps, a camera and of course the ability to make calls and send text messages. But what other features should all smartphones have, regardless of what company makes it or what operating system it runs? A few years ago, I probably would have pointed to Apple's iPhone to answer that question. But today, as we await next month's expected launch of the latest iPhone, rival manufacturers are making phones with some incredibly useful features that you won't find on Apple's handsets -- at least not yet. For full disclosure, I've used an iPhone as my primary phone since 2008. But as CNN's mobile editor, I get to spend quality time with Android Phones, Windows Phones and lots of other devices. So here's my list of five non-iPhone features that I'd love to see become standard on all phones. Consider it an open letter to the makers of all smartphones. Maybe some of these nifty tools will inspire you to switch phones, or at least think twice the next time you're due for an upgrade. 1. An underwater phone that's not hideous . Waterproof phones have existed for years, but they've typically been bulky things that look like they belong on a construction site and lack the apps and other features of the most popular smartphones. You can buy waterproof cases from companies like LifeProof, but they make your phone heavier and are expensive. That's why I was excited when I heard about a water-resistant version of the Samsung Galaxy S4, the wildly popular smartphone that was recently rated as the top smartphone by Consumer Reports. It's dubbed the Samsung Galaxy S4 Active, and you would never know it's a water-resistant phone unless someone told you. It's just a little bit thicker than the standard Samsung Galaxy S4 and has a camera with fewer megapixels, but it's still got a stylish design and gorgeous 5-inch screen. The instructions say you can take it in three feet of water for up to 30 minutes, as long as you cover up the power port and make sure the back cover is on snugly. I was dubious, so I made sure to back up my photos and videos in case something went wrong. We've been trained our whole lives to be careful when using our phones around water, so wading into a swimming pool while holding the phone was a little nerve-wracking. After taking a few photos while standing in chest deep water, I switched on the underwater camera mode and took the plunge. I captured some great underwater shots, like the one in the photo gallery above. Having a water-resistant phone also comes in handy if you want to walk around with your phone in your wet bathing suit. Other adults looked at me curiously while I was using my smartphone in the water, but my 2-year-old son, Jack, didn't flinch. Hopefully, water-resistant phones will become standard before he's old enough to own one. 2. Selfie mode . Let's talk about selfies for a minute. Love them or hate them, chances are you or someone you love has used a smartphone's front-facing camera to snap a self-portrait. But it's typically an awkward process. You have to extend your arm as far as you can while using one of your fingers to press the camera button. This often leads to blurry photos and photos where part of your face gets cut off. The HTC One Android phone has a dead simple way to improve your selfies. After you switch to the front-facing camera and press the shutter button, a countdown timer starts automatically, allowing you to get into perfect position for your self-portrait. I'd guess that the vast majority of photos that are taken with a phone's front-facing camera are selfies, so all phones should have this countdown timer built into the camera. (It's worth noting that there are lots of camera apps that offer a countdown timer.) 3. Never update an app again . If you have an iPhone, chances are you have dozens of app updates waiting for you in the App Store. The pain of having to manually update iPhone apps even prompted Sen. John McCain to ask Apple CEO Tim Cook at a recent congressional hearing, ""Why the hell do I have to keep updating the apps on my iPhone all the time, and why don't you fix that?"" Users of Android phones don't have that problem: Their apps update automatically. That should be the case on all smartphones. And there's good news for McCain and all of iPhone Nation; iOS7, the next version of Apple's mobile operating system, will include the option to have your apps update automatically. 4. Live tiles/widgets . Sometimes, when we look at our phones, we just want to quickly find a key piece of information, like the score of a football game, the temperature outside or the time a movie is playing. On an iPhone, to find this information, you have to launch an app or go into your notification center. But both Android and Windows phones have a feature that saves you a step. Android's widgets let you install little bits of automatically updating information on your phone's home screen: what's on your calendar for the day, sports scores, extended weather forecast or news headlines. ""Live tiles"" on Windows Phones look like app icons, but instead of just sitting there, they display live information without you having to open the app. 5. A safer way to use your phone while driving . As smartphones have added features like voice-guided navigation and streaming music services, they've become incredibly useful while in a car. But obviously, looking down at your phone while driving is not a good idea. Voice-assistance features like the iPhone's Siri have made us a little safer by allowing us to speak commands to our phones, but they still require you to press a button to activate the microphone. Many new cars come with features that let you wirelessly connect your phone to your car so you can use the car's controls to make calls, listen to music or get directions. But setting up these features can be complex. The new Moto X smartphone from Google -- the first phone Google designed since buying Motorola last year -- has two new features that let you continue using your smartphone in the car without sacrificing a ton of safety. I haven't been able to use the Moto X yet, but many early reviews highlight these two features as being incredibly useful. The first is touchless control, which lets you speak voice commands to your phone without touching it. After you train the phone to recognize only your voice, it is always listening for your command, whether its screen is awake or sleeping. Without needing to touch the phone, you just say ""OK Google Now"" and you can make calls, get directions or do a Google search. As many reviews have pointed out, however, there is a catch: If you protect your phone with a password, you can use touchless controls only to make a call. Other commands require you to unlock it with your hands. Hopefully, this is something Google will fix with a software update. The other breakout feature is called ""Assist,"" which automatically detects when you're in motion and switches to a ""Driving"" mode designed to make you safer in the car. It reads new text messages aloud, announces the name of new phone callers and asks whether you want to take the call. Given all the patent lawsuits that are sweeping the phone industry, who knows whether all of these features will ever become standard on all phones. But all the competition is great for consumers. And a guy can certainly dream. What other features do you think should be standard on all phones? Let us know in the comments. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Etan Horowitz.","CNN mobile editor Etan Horowitz suggests 5 features that should be on all smartphones .

"(CNN) -- China executed 13 people Monday who were indicted on terrorism charges related to attacks on public places in Xinjiang province in recent months, according to China's Xinhua news agency. They were among dozens arrested and publicly tried after a government crackdown on terrorism in the region. Twenty-nine people were killed and 130 injured when men armed with long knives stormed a train station in Kunming in March. The next month, an attack on a train station in Urumqi, Xinjiang's capital, left three dead, including the attackers, and an attack on an Urumqi market in May killed at least 39. Those executed are believed to be close to or part of China's Uyghur minority, a mainly Turkic-speaking Muslim population. The Higher People's Court of Xinjiang, Uyghur Autonomous Region, found them guilty of organizing, leading and participating in terrorist groups; murder; arson; theft; and the illegal manufacture, storage and transportation of explosives, according to Xinhua. Some Uyghurs have expressed resentment toward China's Han majority in recent years over what they say is harsh treatment from Chinese security forces and Han people taking the lion's share of economic opportunities in Xinjiang. Amnesty International said Uyghurs face widespread discrimination, including in employment, housing and educational opportunities, as well as curtailed religious freedom and political marginalization. Dozens of others tried and convicted received sentences ranging from delayed death penalties to life sentences and other lengthy prison terms, according to Xinhua. Yu Huitang, a spokesman with the Xinjiang Regional Higher People's Court, said in May that ""the sentences are a warning to those who have religious extremist thoughts and intend to incite violence."" Chinese authorities say they apprehended more than 200 terror cells in Xinjiang last year and, according to Xinhua, China's leaders have ""vowed to resolutely stop terrorism and severely punish terrorists."" CNN's Aliza Kassim, Tim Hume and Dayu Zhang contributed to this report.","13 people were executed for terrorism, Chinese media reports .

"(CNN) -- When people want to give back to their community, they typically pull out their checkbooks. Jayson Black decided to pull out his running shoes. The 28-year-old IT consultant pledged to run 26.2 miles a day for 26 days -- a total of 681.2 miles -- to raise money and awareness for the Three Square Food Bank of Southern Nevada. ""My hopes are that people will see and hear about this epic mission and open their eyes a little bit,"" Black said on day eight of his challenge. ""Las Vegas isn't all about the sparkling lights and big hotels and casinos. In the shadows and down the alleys that surround the Strip, people are hungry."" The mission . Black first came to CNN's attention through longtime iReporter Chris Morrow, who was in Las Vegas and read about his campaign. Black spent Thanksgiving Day on the street. He woke up, went to church and ran all day. After completing his daily marathon, Black came home for a Thanksgiving meal of salad and protein shakes. CNN iReport: 26 marathons in 26 days . He's not complaining. He says he started this challenge to draw attention to impoverished people who go hungry on a daily basis. ""You drive around any city in the United States, and there's always someone somewhere holding a sign or digging through a garbage can for something to eat,"" he says. ""It's great that everyone donates a turkey at Thanksgiving, but this is something bigger than just Thanksgiving."" An estimated 16.2% of the Southern Nevada population is considered ""food insecure,"" meaning people do not know when or from where their next meal will come. That's above the national average of 14.5% for 2012, according to Feeding America. Nationally, some 17.6 million households are considered ""food insecure."" Matt Muldoon, chief development officer at Three Square Food Bank, says Southern Nevada's continued poverty is due in large part to the ""triple whammy"" that occurred in 2008: home foreclosures, bankruptcies and high unemployment. ""The economic recovery -- if there's any going on in the country -- has really not entrenched itself here,"" Muldoon says. Though Black has never participated in an official race, he often runs marathon distances. The most he has ever run in one day is 52 miles. When Black pitched his idea, Muldoon knew he could trust Black to complete this challenge to raise money and awareness for the food bank. ""The first observation I made about Jay was that he was very calm,"" Muldoon says. ""And with that calmness was a very big aura of confidence that he could physically accomplish this feat."" One step at a time . Each day, Black woke up at 4:15 a.m. He went to the kitchen for an energizing shake, then took a hot shower and got ready to run another 26.2 miles. But it wasn't always easy. Because he wasn't racing, it took Black five to six hours to complete the distance each day. He usually ran outside but often had trouble finding an open road to run on. He also suffered from a shin injury and a stress fracture, but it didn't stop him. ""I kind of look at my body as an engine,"" he says. ""Unless doctors say you can't go any further, then we're going to get to the finish line."" When he first told his friends that he would complete 26 marathons in 26 days, they had mixed reactions. ""Some of my friends said, 'You are nuts. How is your body going to handle it?' And then I told them why I was doing it,"" he says. ""They would start off dumbfounded, but they would always walk away inspired."" Even though Black was confident, he sometimes worried he might not be able to cross the finish line. If he got seriously injured, there was no other plan than to quit. But all doubts vanished when Black ran along the Las Vegas Strip. ""We ran into a lot of homeless people downtown, and once you tell them what you're doing, they get a little sparkle in their eye,"" he says. ""And they thank you. That's probably one of the most gratifying parts of this whole thing -- knowing that I have an opportunity to tell these people that we haven't forgotten about them."" The finish line . Black set out with a mission to raise both financial donations and nonperishable food items for the food bank. Muldoon says he didn't want to peg Black's efforts to a specific dollar amount. In fact, Muldoon hasn't even kept track of the amount of money raised during the challenge. ""If I am focused on just the dollar amount, then I'm missing the purpose of exactly what he's trying to accomplish here,"" he says. Black started with a goal of $4,000. He raised a total of $4,024. All of his proceeds will go to the Three Square Food Bank. Because of the food bank's efficiencies, Muldoon says each dollar can be turned into three meals. To commemorate his achievement, the Clark County Board of Commissioners in Nevada declared December 23, 2013, Jayson Black Day. ""For the first time in my life, I feel truly blessed. It's not really a sense of relief, it's a sense of accomplishment,"" Black said after finishing. ""We don't have any specific plans yet, but we'll wrap up 2013 with a big bow and then we'll get a team together and start thinking about next year."" Though Black's mission came to an end Monday, he wants people to know they can make a positive contribution in their own communities no matter where they are located. ""You don't have to run 26 marathons in 26 days to make someone smile,"" he says. ""You don't have to do crazy epic stuff. Any one of us can make a difference.""","Jayson Black, 28, ran a total of 681.2 miles to raise money for Three Square Food Bank .

"(CNN) -- If a fellow is going to spend 55 years working in the same place, he would be wise to count his blessings that the place is Riverdale. ""The first day I walked in, in 1958, I was 17 years old,"" said Victor Gorelick. ""I took a job as a fill-in art assistant."" He never went on to college. He never took another job. Today he is 72. His explanation for staying is so basic he can express it in a single sentence: . ""I decided to stick with Archie."" And Betty. And Veronica. And Jughead. And Reggie. And, most of all, Riverdale, U.S.A. It doesn't exist, of course, which is probably what makes the town so perfect. Nothing in real life could match it. Archie Andrews first appeared in a comic book in 1941, and that idealized town in which he and his friends have always lived has never been identified by state. Some readers assume it is in the Midwest, but Gorelick -- the longest-serving employee of Archie Comics, and now its editor-in-chief -- will go no further than to say that ""it's in a place that has four seasons."" The summer, autumn, winter and spring in the pages of the comic books have never been the same seasons that Gorelick has observed outside the windows of the Archie offices in Westchester County, New York: ""We have a four-month lead time. So the season an artist is drawing on a given day is not the same season we're living in actual life."" But actual life is not the key to Archie's eternal appeal, which may have a lot to do with what attracted Gorelick to the character, and the company, in the first place. He grew up in Brooklyn, an only child until he was 16: ""My father worked in a fish market. He'd leave the house at 4:30 or 5 o'clock in the morning, he would clean fish and sell fish all day, and he would come home tired with fish scales and sawdust on his shoes. I would clean his shoes. He worked so hard for his money. He never took me fishing."" Archie Andrews' world, mythical though it was, had to have looked pretty swell next to that. When Gorelick, with Dwight D. Eisenhower in the White House, showed up for that fill-in job in the art department, his own comic-book tastes had tended toward ""Tales from the Crypt."" But he soon became enchanted with the gentle simplicity of the problems Archie faced: ""He's this klutzy, well-meaning kid who breaks things by mistake in Veronica's house, or who cooks a beautiful breakfast to bring upstairs to his mother on Mother's Day, but leaves behind a mess in the kitchen."" Gorelick's real life may or may not be any more irritation-free than anyone else's -- on the day we spoke he was battling a nagging cough that wouldn't let go -- but there is something to be said for being able, for all these years, to lose himself, professionally, in a comic-book world where matters are ever placid, ever sunny. He has even been able to derive inspiration from the characters who live on those pages; Archie takes solace in having a close buddy, Jughead Jones, ""who he can talk to and tell him anything."" Gorelick said he has come to realize that his own Jughead Jones, his port in a storm, ""lives in New Jersey. His name is Bert Bailin. I've known him for 65 years, since we were kids. He was my best man -- twice."" Ten presidents have succeeded Eisenhower during Gorelick's years with Archie, and the country has changed in myriad ways. Some of those changes have been reflected in the storylines of the comics -- racial and ethnic diversity in Riverdale, the introduction of a popular gay character -- and others have manifested themselves in the delivery systems for those stories: the disappearance around the nation of mom-and-pop candy stores with comic-book racks (although Pop Tate's Sweet Shop remains a vibrant Archie landmark), the rise in digital readership and availability of Archie apps. The Archie comic books continue to publish with new stories, in various sizes and lengths; no new Archie newspaper strips are being drawn, although reruns of the old ones are available digitally. Yet what is constant in that make-believe town is more significant than what is altered, Gorelick said: ""Behind everything is the idea that Riverdale is a place that is welcoming to anyone. The goal has always been to be a place of comfort to our readers, especially for our youngest readers."" Nothing terrible or violent happens in Riverdale: ""You have to keep that out of our town. Kids today go through metal detectors at their schools, there are police officers in the hallways, the drugs, the gangs."" By design, ""Archie lives in a world the way we might like it to be."" Gorelick understands how elusive such a world is. When he switches on his computer at work, the ugliness of news headlines on the screen reminds him that none of us really lives in Riverdale. Even in the corporate offices of Archie Comics there has been acrimony in recent years, with lawsuits and bitterness between two top officers. But in the editorial department, Gorelick's job is to keep his focus on pretend streets where nothing becomes much more complicated than ""Archie getting a little bamboozled because he has made a date with two different girls on the same night, and he asks Jughead, 'How did I get into this mess?'"" After all this time, does Archie seem real to him -- even like a friend? ""He's my best friend -- he's paid me every week for 55 years."" Does he think about Archie after he's closed his office door for the night? ""Constantly. I've got a framed oil portrait of him in my den at home."" Does Archie's perpetual smiling youth ever make him consider his own mortality? ""I know I'm not going to be around forever. Archie goes on.""

"(CNN) -- The San Francisco man arrested after what the FBI says are bomb-making materials were found in his home was charged Tuesday with possession of an illegal destructive device. Ryan Kelly Chamberlain II was unemotional during the 15-minute hearing in U.S. District Court in San Francisco. Judge Nathaniel Cousins ordered a status conference in the case for Wednesday and a detention hearing Thursday. Chamberlain, 42, was arrested Monday night at Crissy Field, a scenic waterfront area popular with tourists where Golden Gate Bridge spans the Pacific entrance to San Francisco Bay. Authorities had been looking for him after searching his neighborhood Saturday on a tip that he had ""items of great concern"" at his home, FBI Special Agent in Charge David Johnson told reporters. According to an affidavit filed Sunday by agents seeking an arrest warrant, bomb technicians found a glass jar with batteries and a powdery, green substance inside; a model rocket motor; ball bearings and screws; an igniter for home-made bombs; a conductive wire; and a circuit board that could act as a remote-controlled receiver. The green powder was explosive material, says the affidavit, signed by Special Agent Michael P. Eldridge. The circuit board would have allowed someone to set off the device ""for afar,"" the filing says without elaborating on how far away someone could have been and detonated a bomb. There is no mention of ricin being found, contradicting some media reports. The affidavit says Chamberlain fled from agents after Eldridge interviewed him for a short time at a coffee shop near his apartment on Saturday. After Chamberlain asked to leave, he got in his car and raced away, the agent explained, saying the FBI decided not to pursue out of concern for the safety for people who lived nearby. The block was closed for some 15 hours over the weekend as investigators searched and cleared the area, CNN affiliate KTVU reported. If convicted of the illegal destructive device possession charge, Chamberlain faces up to 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine. Johnson declined to say what, if anything, Chamberlain had planned to do or what motivated him. San Francisco Police Chief Greg Suhr said without elaborating that it was clear Chamberlain was ""absolutely growing more desperate."" ""This subject, Mr. Chamberlain, was a very dangerous and desperate person,"" Suhr said. According to CNN affiliate KPIX, Chamberlain had posted an apparent suicide note to friends on Facebook titled ""Goodbye."" The letter describes a history of depression, despair over a broken relationship and career problems. ""In the span of a few months, everything that mattered to me betrayed me,"" the writer said. FBI spokesman Peter Lee said investigators were trying to verify the origin of the post. Howard Epstein, a former chairman of the San Francisco Republican Party, told KTVU that Chamberlain worked with the local GOP before switching to work on the Democratic side. ""The only one I know that he worked with after he left the party was Gavin Newsom,"" Epstein told KTVU. ""He was an organizer when Gavin ran for mayor."" Newsom, a Democrat, is now California's lieutenant governor. In the letter, the writer says he's had some positive moments in the past few months. ""But so much was broken from this past year-and-a-half, and from moments way back before that, I guess it was insurmountable, and the time's up,"" the writer says. ""Thank you. I'm sorry. I love you."" Police: Minnesota teen planned school massacre . Russian man faces weapon of mass destruction charges .

"(CNN) -- As one woman in glittering Lycra gently bends her legs backwards over her head, another balances on top, slowly twisting her own limbs into a human pretzel. They move as one -- a fantastical insect bewitching the Las Vegas crowds in Cirque Du Soleil's legendary stage show, called simply ""O."" But despite their ethereal demeanor, each petite performer possesses a rare Herculean strength and snake-like flexibility. And almost all hail from one country: Mongolia. ""When you want a top baseball player, sometimes you look in America. Where we need a contortionist we look to Mongolia,"" said the show's artistic director, Sandi Croft. ""When they dance they have a natural flexibility, even in their folk dance. It is just part of their culture to have this extra bend in delivery with their movement."" Why Mongolia? The bright lights of Las Vegas are a long way from the plains of Mongolia, a sparsely populated country bordering China and Russia. But in the last 70 years, Mongolia has become a breeding ground for the world's top contortionists, who have performed everywhere from Russia's Bolshoi Theater to the Monte Carlo International Circus Festival. Indeed, while other well-meaning parents around the world might send their little girls to ballet or piano lessons, in Mongolia they're more likely to drop them off at contortion school. Watch: The art of contortion . While Mongolian contortion has some similarities to ancient folk dances and yoga poses, it was the launch of the State Circus in the 1940s that saw it really take off as a professional art form. When the contortion school's first official trainer, the now legendary Tsend-Ayush, began performing across the country, she quickly inspired a generation of girls hoping to quite literally mold themselves in her likeness. One of those children was then-eight-year-old Angelique Janov, now the trainer for Cirque du Soleil's ""O."" ""We'd never seen anything like Tsend-Ayush before,"" she said. ""It was her combination of strong technical skills and the beautiful way she moved to the music -- she made it look so easy. ""After that, every little girl wanted to be a contortionist."" Child's play . Of course, training to be a contortionist is far from easy. Students as young as five train for around three hours a day, five days a week. They build up their strength, flexibility and balance through various exercises such as handstands, splits, and push-ups. ""My homework was 300 push-ups a day,"" said 29-year-old Nomintuya Baasankhuu, former contortionist and Arts Program director at the Arts Council of Mongolia. ""It was intense. But by eight years old I could do most of the technical moves -- I was considered a professional."" There are some risks -- Baasankhuu suffered a knee injury after falling from a human tower three meters high. But many contortionists insist that much like any sport, it is safe if done properly. ""Contortion is not dangerous,"" said 55-year-old Cirque du Soleil trainer Janov. ""It's like yoga -- if you're stretching every day you stay young."" Naturally gifted? Such rigorous training regimes have been a huge factor in the Mongolians' success around the world. But how much of a role does genetics play? ""Some people are naturally more flexible and this is often due to genetics -- if one of our parents is flexible, we're more likely to be flexible too,"" said Tim Allardyce of the British Osteopathic Association. ""That said, a naturally flexible person would not be able to get themselves into positions that contortionists can without extensive training -- it is only very gradually, over many months and years, that the ligaments and muscles lengthen, allowing the joints to become more mobile."" World of opportunity . For many youngsters in Mongolia, contortion is seen as more than simply a hobby -- it's a golden ticket to the world. ""Mongolian contortion is globally competitive -- today many performers work for Cirque du Soleil and other international circus companies,"" said Baasankhuu, who also researched the history of Mongolian contortion at the National University of Mongolia. ""That is why so many girls would like to become contortionists and travel around world and make living from it."" So what is it about these mysterious performers that continues to beguile audiences across the world? Janov perhaps summed up their allure best: ""It's the realization that an individual can do things that seem impossible.""","Mongolia home to some of world's greatest contortionists .
Many now perform in international circuses, including Cirque du Soliel .

"(CNN) -- Borat meets Saddam Hussein? Maybe not, but Sasha Baron Cohen's next comedy project draws from the former Iraqi strongman -- or rather from his writings. Hussein, executed in Iraq in 2006, fancied himself something of a novelist, penning four of them while ruling Iraq. Baron Cohen's next film, ""The Dictator,"" is inspired by Hussein's ""Zabibah and the King,"" a romance novel originally published anonymously in 2000, reportedly as an allegory for the U.S. invasion of Iraq in the First Gulf War. Baron Cohen's version ""tells the heroic story of a dictator who risked his life to ensure that democracy would never come to the country he so lovingly oppressed,"" according to Paramount Pictures, which will distribute the film.

"Statesville, North Carolina (CNN) -- It was supposed to be a routine patrol for Dale Beatty, a National Guardsman serving in northern Iraq. But when the Humvee he was in veered slightly off the road, his life changed in an instant. ""I remember seeing all the sand across the dash of the Humvee go up in the air. That was pretty much the last thing I remember,"" Beatty recalled eight years later. ""And there was a big boom, lots of pain."" The vehicle hit an anti-tank land mine, flying nearly 50 feet in the air. When Beatty came to, his legs were pinned under the wreckage. Within days, both were amputated below the knee. It was a life-altering injury, but from the beginning, Beatty had a positive attitude about it. ""For some reason, I've always been able to see how lucky I am,"" he reflected, noting that his injuries made it possible to wear prosthetic legs. ""It's not like losing a fingernail. But ... it's just the way it has to be. I've met people that have been hurt a lot worse than me that have lived full, fulfilling lives. So there's no excuse for me not to."" Beatty spent a year recovering at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, and he hoped to build a house for his wife and two young sons when he returned home to Statesville, North Carolina. But given his new reality -- two prosthetic legs and, at times, a wheelchair -- he wasn't sure how he'd manage it. That's when a member of his church, who'd heard about Beatty's situation, took action. He persuaded the Iredell County Builders Association -- of which he was a member -- to help Beatty build a wheelchair-accessible home with wide doorways and roll-in bathrooms. The land was donated by Beatty's father, and volunteers pitched in to help while Beatty supervised. ""The whole community helping me, and working alongside me, it was such a good feeling,"" said Beatty, now 34. Throughout the construction, Beatty consulted his friend John Gallina, a building contractor with whom he'd served in the National Guard and was driving the Humvee when it hit the land mine. Gallina suffered a traumatic brain injury in the blast and was later diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. While his wounds were less visible than Beatty's, he also struggled to adjust to post-war life. When the house was finished, Beatty and Gallina decided to ""pay it forward"" to help other disabled veterans. In 2008, they pooled their military disability payments and started Purple Heart Homes, a nonprofit that so far has modified or helped provide homes for 30 disabled veterans in several East Coast states. ""There's thousands of veterans right here in our midst,"" Beatty said. ""People don't realize the need that's out there."" In the past decade, a number of nonprofits have sprung up to help Iraq and Afghanistan veterans with their housing issues. But according to the Department of Veterans Affairs, those two wars account for only a small percent -- less than 15% -- of the entire veteran population. Beatty's and Gallina's organization will help any disabled service member who was wounded during his or her military service, even if it was decades ago. ""The Gulf War vets have a lot of issues, and we know there are people who got hurt in Bosnia, Kosovo ... Vietnam,"" Beatty said. ""We just wanted to level the playing field."" Dave Morrell, who lives near Beatty in Harrisburg, North Carolina, served three tours with the Special Forces in Vietnam and ultimately lost a leg because of complications from exposure to Agent Orange. When Beatty and Gallina heard that he often had to crawl into his bathroom because his wheelchair wouldn't fit through his home's narrow doorways, they decided to help. ""I'd have been happy if they could've figured a way just to widen the door,"" Morrell said. ""To have them build a complete new addition and a whole new bathroom was unbelievable."" Purple Heart Homes, using donated labor and materials, will help any disabled veteran who is a homeowner, and all repairs are free. Beatty and Gallina know that projects such as adding ramps or renovating bathrooms can make a big difference for veterans and their caregivers. ""We want to make those changes that make their life easier, safer, just better,"" Beatty said. Beatty and Gallina also want to help those who can't afford to buy their own home, many from the younger generation. While the organization has built a couple of houses from the ground up, it has also developed a program that moves veterans into foreclosed properties donated by banks and municipalities. The group matches a disabled veteran with each property and then partners with a community organization that can gather volunteers to renovate it. This local support is an essential part of Purple Heart Homes. Beatty and Gallina believe that working with community members makes a big difference to veterans, who can often feel isolated and socially withdrawn. ""When you have people saying thank you (by coming) to your home to swing a hammer and paint a wall, it says something different than shaking your hand and buying you a drink,"" said Gallina, 34. ""And that support continues once the project is done."" Demond Taylor is an Iraq war veteran who suffers from PTSD, among other things. His future home in South Euclid, Ohio, is still in the process of being renovated, but he's already feeling the benefits of the project. ""Every time I turn around, it's a new person saying hello,"" Taylor said. ""This is the first time since I got home that I actually felt the 'thank you,' the 'wish you well.' "" When the renovation work is finished on these donated homes, the house is appraised and Purple Heart Homes will help the veteran get a mortgage for 50% or less of its value. Beatty and Gallina discovered that many veterans struggle with poor credit, so by making affordable payments on a mortgage, they are able to improve their credit score and build equity. Beatty believes it's a solution that helps veterans as well as their communities. ""We are putting value back into the properties by not making them free, and we are putting value into the veteran,"" Beatty said. ""This is a hand up, not a handout."" With donations and grants, Purple Heart Homes has grown rapidly since it was founded four years ago. The nonprofit has received more than 700 applications, and it gets about four or five new ones a week. More than 100 projects have already been approved and are in the pipeline. Beatty and Gallina say their new mission is more than just providing veterans with accessible homes; it's about encouraging communities to get involved with those who served their country. ""My great-grandfather was in World War I, grandfather was in World War II, my dad was in Vietnam. I've seen the uniforms hanging in the closets,"" Beatty said. ""Other people have no connection. ... (We want) to just open people's eyes."" Kevin Smith is a Vietnam veteran from Newton, North Carolina, who suffered knee and back injuries in an accident aboard an aircraft carrier. For decades, he endured dozens of operations and gradually became more reclusive -- in part because he was afraid of falling down his front steps, which didn't have a handrail. ""For 35 years, no one cared,"" Smith said. But when Purple Heart Homes built a wheelchair ramp in front of his home, it changed his life.

"(CNN) -- George H.W. Bush marked his 80th and 85th birthdays with parachute jumps. He said after the second jump: ""Just because you're an old guy, you don't have to sit around drooling in the corner. Get out and do something. Get out and enjoy life."" Now 88, Bush has been struggling with serious health concerns, including bronchitis. We need him to recover, to set an example for the world of how a man can mark his 90th. The son of a U.S. senator, Bush has been a naval aviator hero, oil millionaire, member of Congress, ambassador to China, CIA director, vice president of the United States and then the president who managed the end of the Cold War. He has lived more life than seems possible for any single human being. The achievements of that remarkable life are overshadowed by one negative fact: Along with Herbert Hoover and Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush is only one of three 20th-century presidents to have lost re-election. Yet while Hoover's presidency and Carter's are largely regarded as failures by posterity, the judgment on Bush's has become more forgiving over time. Eighteen months ago, former President Bill Clinton paid this tribute to his predecessor in office: . ""George W. Bush did me one of the great favors of my life. He asked me, not once,but twice, to work with his father to help people in need: first in South Asia in the tsunami and then in the Gulf Coast after Katrina. All told, we took seven trips together. It was an amazing experience. This man, whom I'd always liked and respected and then run against in a painful campaign in some ways, I literally came to love."" In the years ahead, we will hear more such tributes -- tributes that may at last do justice to a president whose most important accomplishment has been persistently undervalued and misattributed. In the summer of 1987, President Ronald Reagan visited divided Berlin and urged, ""Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall."" It was a stirring moment, a stunning speech. In documentaries about the end of the Cold War, that speech always gets prominent attention, as it should. Yet it is also true that after Reagan spoke his words ... nothing much happened. Nothing much happened for a year. Nothing much happened for a second year. Not until deep in 1989, two years later, did the communist system in central Europe begin its implosion: first in Poland, then in Hungary and only in November of 1989 in eastern Germany. In one ecstatic night, the East German regime's border guards did nothing as local protesters overwhelmed the dividing wall. Then morning came, and Europe confronted the same question it had confronted for half a century: What would Russia do? Since 1945, the Soviet rulers had made clear they would plunge the world into war rather than accept a reunited Germany. In November 1989, they still commanded the power to do just that. Over the next few months, the Soviets changed their minds. They acquiesced to the surrender of their single most fundamental geopolitical claim. They acquiesced without violence and without getting much of anything in return. In the history of world diplomacy, there has never been a negotiation like this one. That work of negotiation fell not to the eloquent Ronald Reagan but to George H.W. Bush, who never saw a speech he didn't mangle. There is no ""tear down this wall"" clip by Bush. But it was during his presidency that the wall was in fact demolished -- and not by some lucky accident but after months of agonizing work by Germans and Americans together. There's a saying in Hollywood: ""He who will not toot his own horn, his horn shall not be tooted."" George Herbert Walker Bush is an inveterate non-horn-tooter. He did not toot his horn over the end of the Cold War. He did not toot his own horn over his deficit reductions. He believed that horn-tooting risked alienating the very people whose cooperation had made the accomplishment possible in the first place. Very likely, he was right, too. As the former president fights off the illness that sent him to the hospital, though, perhaps it would be well if he did hear a few toots from other people's horns: the Germans and other Central Europeans whose progress to freedom his diplomacy assisted; the Kuwaitis who owe their country to him; and too-neglectful Americans, to whom he bequeathed a world more peaceful, more stable and more free. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: George H.W. Bush, 88, must recover to continue to inspire on way to 90 .

The companies are aimed at an audience of African-American and urban consumers, and they own 53 radio stations in 16 cities, a cable network and a variety of Web sites. Liggins personally has contributed to Barack Obama's campaign. Alfred Liggins says the black population in America has grown increasingly diverse. (CNN) -- If you think African-Americans will come out in greater numbers than ever before to vote for Barack Obama, you're probably right. If you think you know how they'll vote in the almost 500 House, Senate and gubernatorial races, you could be in for a surprise. Although politicians and their advertising gurus often speak to Black America as a collective, homogeneous group, the black population is anything but a monolith. In the past decade, the more than 40 million strong black population in America has become increasingly diverse: economically, socially, technologically and even philosophically. In the final push toward Election Day, as politicians and political hopefuls seek to penetrate this community, they may no longer understand to whom they are speaking. Are they addressing blacks or African-Americans? Is racial prejudice as important an issue today as affording a college education for their kids or taking care of an aging parent? iReport.com: Black college cancels class to vote . Radio One, the country's largest broadcasting company primarily targeting African-Americans, recently commissioned a study to uncover Black America today. How do they identify themselves? What do they care about? How are they influenced? What is most important to them? Interestingly, the study found that 42 percent of those polled actually prefer to be called black (these are more likely to be more affluent) compared with 44 percent who choose to be described as African-American. And yes, it would be misguided to assume that dropping a Martin Luther King Jr. quote into a speech and focusing on America's history of racial inequality is the sure way to sway black voters when one-third of blacks, particularly younger people, believe that there is actually too much focus on past oppression. And as insulting as it is to assume that all women vote for female candidates, it is equally inaccurate and offensive to say that blacks simply cast their ballots for people of color. Like all Americans, black folks vote on the issues they care about, and today those issues are less likely to be linked to race than they are to the economy, health care, education and a whole spectrum of social issues. As Georgetown University sociology professor Michael Eric Dyson recently said, ""black people don't vote for candidates just because they are black. If Clarence Thomas ran for president, he would get five black votes."" Given Black America's extreme diversity today (the study identified 11 specific groups) it is easy to misunderstand who they are and how they can be reached. Yes, discrimination and racial issues are still incredibly important, particularly to middle-age and older blacks. But the younger populations are more concerned about starting their own businesses, paying for their education, taking care of their children and creating a better work/life balance. So how do politicians penetrate the multiple segments of Black America? In 1992, when Bill Clinton wooed African-Americans in church, he understood how to effectively reach that population. But that was before social networking sites attracted millions of teenage and young black adults. Now that the digital divide has faded, with roughly the same percentage of blacks online as the general population, ignoring black Web sites and social networking sites would be a big mistake. Although the history of black oppression in America is not the radioactive issue it once was, trust in the community -- whom blacks trust -- is still paramount. Of all institutions, they are least likely to trust credit card companies but also remain seriously wary of the mainstream media and tend to trust black media more than traditional media outlets. It has been almost a century and a half since blacks in America won the right to vote. It makes all the sense in the world that the black community has evolved and diversified over the years, but too often politicians make the mistake of assuming that blacks are still a monolithic group fixated on all of the same issues. Though Barack Obama will be able to count on a massive percentage of the black vote on Election Day, the rest of the ticket will need to dig deeper than the canned speeches dealing with racial injustice of the past to satisfy today's black voters. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Alfred Liggins.","Alfred Liggins: America's black population has become more diverse .

"(CNN) -- The level of odorous chemical in West Virginians' water dropped Friday, but not enough for authorities to lift a warning to avoid drinking, cooking or bathing with it or to give a clear idea as to when things will change. Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin described the situation in nine counties Friday night as ""pretty bad,"" both for residents being told the only thing they should do with their running water is flush their toilets and schools, restaurants, hotels and other businesses forced to close. One bit of good news is tests on the affected water supply, which are being conducted on an hourly basis, show ""the chemical level is declining."" ""But we're just not sure exactly how long it's going to take before it's acceptable to lift the do-not-drink ban,"" the governor told CNN. Much of the anger centers around the coal-industry company from which the chemical leak occurred. And there's also frustration among some -- including Danny Jones, the mayor of West Virginia's most populated city and capital, Charleston -- that the water company trying to deal with the resulting mess still doesn't have a timeline for when things will return to normal. ""It's caused us more problems than you could ever imagine,"" Jones said Friday night, pointing out people can't do things like wash their hands after going to bathroom or wash their clothes. ""... It's a prison from which we would like to be released."" Utility official on water: 'I can't say it is safe' The crisis began Thursday, when residents of Kanawha County reported a foul odor -- similar to licorice -- in the air. The Kanawha County Fire Department and the state Department of Environmental Protection that day traced that smell to a leak from a 35,000-gallon storage tank along the Elk River. The chemical had overflowed a containment area around the tank run by Freedom Industries, then migrated over land and through the soil into the river. The leak happened about a mile upriver from the impacted West Virginia American Water Co. plant. After concluding the tap water was contaminated late Thursday afternoon, a stop-use warning went out to customers in Boone, Cabell, Clay, Jackson, Kanawha, Lincoln, Logan, Putnam and Roane counties. West Virginia American Water's president Jeff McIntyre said Friday he didn't believe the substance -- 4-methylcyclohexane methanol -- was still flowing. But that doesn't mean the situation will be resolved soon. What is 4-methylcyclohexane methanol? ""It is not intended to be in the water (or) distribution system,"" McIntyre said. ""... Once it's in there, there's no more treatment for it."" While there haven't been reported widespread sicknesses, the ordeal is having a big impact. Kanawha County Commission president Kent Carper told reporters Friday more than 300,000 people have been affected. Tomblin gave a lower estimate -- saying it was ""way over 100,000 (but) we don't have an exact number yet of people ... without water."" Businesses -- including 15 McDonald's in the area, according to their ownership group -- have shut down. Hospitals have taken emergency measures to conserve water. And residents have been scrambling, as evidenced by empty shelves and worries at home. ""It's all very hectic,"" said Patricia Pearl of Charleston. ""You don't even want to go to the grocery store. I think everyone is in a panic."" Emergency rooms busy, businesses closed . The emergency's ripple effects included the closure Friday of the state Supreme Court of Appeals in Charleston, courts in Boone and Lincoln counties, and the cancellation of classes at West Virginia State University. In addition to shuttering her shop Flowers & More on Friday -- usually her busiest day -- Pearl noted other ripple effects, like how her 60-year-old husband's physical therapy session tied to a recent knee surgery was canceled. ""The problem is that no one seems to know when we'll have the water restored,"" she said. First responders and hospitals saw a rush of activity after the alert went out. Carper said more than 1,000 calls were placed in four or five hours to the 911 center, 24 of them for emergency medical services -- five of which led to people being taken to hospitals. Water company spokeswoman Laura Jordan urged people to get medical attention ""if they are feeling something ... isn't right."" Many -- perhaps too many -- did just that. ""Our emergency rooms have been very busy with individuals unnecessarily concerned and presenting no symptoms,"" said Charleston Area Medical Center. The restrictions affected the hospital in other ways, too. It put into place linen conservation and alternative cleaning methods and turned away all but emergency patients. Daniel Stewart sued the water utility and Freedom Industries, saying his kidney transplant surgery was canceled because of the ordeal ""forcing (him) to undergo dialysis, pain and suffering and continued illness due to his renal failure and other medical damages."" West Virginia American Water ""failed to maintain an appropriate emergency response plan,"" Stewart claimed, while Freedom ""failed to properly maintain and store its chemicals."" A lawsuit was filed Friday by a man whose scheduled kidney transplant was canceled due to the water issue, said attorney Jesse Forbes said. CNN reached out to the water company about the lawsuit. ""West Virginia American Water is not focused on litigation at this time. Our focus is on our customers and providing safe adequate water supplies,"" the company said in a statement. Leaked chemical used to wash coal . Freedom Industries is feeling the heat from others as well. President Gary Southern tried several times to walk away from a press conference Friday evening, saying ""it has been an extremely long day,"" only to be called back by insistent reporters -- including one who noted how long a day it has been for all the West Virginians now without drinkable water or a full explanation as to why. ""This incident is extremely unfortunate and unanticipated,"" Southern said. ""... This has been a very, very taxing process."" Freedom's crippled steel tank is about a mile upriver from the West Virginia American Water plant, according to McIntyre. According to Carper, the county official, it's part of a former Pennzoil refinery dating back to the 1930s or 1940s. Jones, Charleston's mayor, said he believes ""the chemicals went through (holes in a retaining) wall."" Southern said two Freedom employees noticed material leaking from a storage tank into a dyke around 10:30 a.m. Thursday. They contacted authorities and began the cleanup process -- including hauling away the chemical still in the tank and vacuuming up some in the nearby ground. ""We have mitigated the risk, we believe, in terms of further material leaving this facility,"" said the head of Freedom, which supplies products for the coal-mining industry. Southern said he couldn't say how much of 4-methylcyclohexane methanol -- which United Mine Workers spokesman Phil Smith explained is used to wash coal before it goes to market -- leaked, only that it was under 35,000 gallons. Tomblin said a maximum of 5,000 gallons of the chemical seeped out. The Freedom Industries president downplayed the chemical's health effects, saying it has ""very, very low toxicity"" and opining it poses no danger to the public. West Virginia American Water and government officials have a different take, as evidenced by the stop-use warning. As McIntrye said, ""We don't know that the water is not safe, but I can't say it is safe."" The federal Environmental Protection Agency -- which doesn't yet have an ""official role"" in the response -- has taken no enforcement actions against Freedom Industries during the past five years, agency spokeswoman Alisha Johnson said. West Virginia's Department of Environmental Protection ordered Freedom to take everything out of its 11 remaining above-ground storage tanks. This came hours after the department issued a ""cease operations order"" for the company, saying it could not receive any additional material until it addresses the effects of the leak and proves its structures are sound. 'I do not know how long this will last' The rush now is on to fully assess and address the problem, and perhaps press criminal charges because of it. Having declared a state of emergency affecting the nine involved counties, Tomblin urged West Virginians to look out for one another -- especially small children and the elderly. To that point, he announced a ""call to action drive"" through Friday evening at the State Capitol to collect items such as bottled water, sanitizer, liquid baby formula, paper and plastic plates and utensils for those in need. This is in addition to water stations set up in malls, churches, high schools, recreation centers and fire departments. The federal government has gotten involved as well, with President Barack Obama signed an emergency declaration authorizing the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate disaster relief efforts. FEMA said Friday that it was sending 75 trucks -- each carrying about 4,900 gallons of water -- to the area. Tomblin said this federal help -- for now, mostly in the form of cases of bottled water -- is helpful, as are the contributions from many donating businesses. U.S. Attorney Booth Goodwin said he and other federal authorities is looking into what happened, telling CNN Friday that ""even a negligent release of this kind could be a criminal violation."" ""It's really too early to tell whether criminal charges could be brought"" against Freedom, he said Friday. ""... We're going to want to figure out just exactly what occurred and when ... But right now, obviously, what we're trying to do is get people's water back on."" Meanwhile, West Virginia American Water is working intently as well, including teaming with DuPont and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to determine the contamination level. Jordan said the system would be flushed and may be returned to service in zones, but she would not speculate when that might occur. The water company also has provided 12 tanker trucks filled with water, and bought four tractor-trailer loads of bottled water for distribution to those in need, McIntyre said. Tomblin noted that ""there is no shortage of bottled water,"" but urged people to see a doctor immediately if they come down with nausea, dizziness, or eye or skin irritation. And he didn't make any promises as to when this emergency would end. ""I do not know how long this will last,"" the governor said. CNN's AnneClaire Stapleton, Mike Ahlers, Paul Caron, Ashley Fantz, Ed Payne, Marlena Baldacci, Kevin Conlon, Susan Candiotti and Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","NEW: The state orders the company behind the leak must remove all chemicals from tanks .

"(CNN) -- The streets of Ferguson finally look like a tranquil Missouri town again. The protests have calmed. Children can safely go back to school. And after Michael Brown was laid to rest, residents are honoring his family's wish for peace. But now a different kind of strife looms: the legal battle over whether Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson was justified in shooting and killing the unarmed teenager. Here's what to expect as the case moves forward: . A grand jury will weigh the case . Twelve members of a local grand jury will decide whether to bring charges against Wilson. The grand jury started hearing testimony last week, but it could take two months before jurors reach a decision. The grand jury must weigh two questions: whether a crime was committed, and whether there is ""probable cause"" that the accused person -- in this case, Wilson -- committed the crime. So who are these jurors? The panel consists of nine white members (six men and three women) and three black members (two women and one man), the St. Louis County Circuit Court administrator said. But their proceedings will not be open to the public. And that doesn't please Brown's family. ""It's about transparency,"" family attorney Benjamin Crump said. ""This community has a distrust for the local enforcement officials. So if you have a secret grand jury proceeding, where nobody knows what the prosecutor presents ... and the grand jury comes back and says we find this (shooting) justified, I think that's going to be very problematic for this community to accept."" A high bar for a conviction . ""It's very tough to convict an officer -- especially once you put all this information out and the jury pool has been tainted,"" Matt Fogg, a retired chief deputy U.S. marshal, told CNN's Don Lemon. Attorney Chris Chestnut put it more bluntly: . ""I don't think he can get a conviction,"" said Chestnut, who represented the family of Jonathan Ferrell. Like Brown, Ferrell was an unarmed black man who was shot and killed by a white police officer. ""The grand jury is relegated -- or limited -- to the evidence put before them, and I'm just not confident that they're going to put all of the evidence before the grand jury."" CNN legal analyst Danny Cevallos said that even if Brown was trying to get away from the officer, the Supreme Court case Tennessee v. Garner allows the use of deadly force when an alleged felon is trying to flee if ""the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others."" A high bar for the officer, too . But given the number of times Brown was shot -- along with newly released audio that may show a pause in rapid gunfire -- Wilson has a lot of explaining to do. ""Evidence suggests that he wasn't fleeing and was facing the officer,"" Cevallos said. ""If that's true ... the officer has to explain six shots. He has to explain a reason for each of those six shots. He has to have justifiably been in fear of his life or fear of some imminent serious bodily harm."" The officer may also have to explain the audio recording, which was taken by a man near the shooting site and apparently reveals a gap in gunfire, which lasted at least 10 shots. CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the tape. The civil rights investigation . While a local grand jury considers the case, a federal civil rights investigation is also under way. Proving a civil rights violation in this case requires proving that Wilson exhibited ""racial hostility,"" CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said. Wilson is white, and Brown was African-American. Opinion: Can peace come to Ferguson? Challenges to returning to the police force . Wilson is on paid administrative leave and would have to undergo two psychological evaluations before returning to duty, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said. But it's possible that Wilson will not come back. ""There are many officers that have separated from service after an incident like this,"" former Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis told CNN's Lemon. ""They can no longer work in the environment where these incidents occurred."" Protests will continue . While many residents hope to avoid the tear gas and Molotov cocktails that flew through the night sky last week, more protests are expected Tuesday. Demonstrators will gather at 6 p.m. for a march on Florissant Avenue, said Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol. And Black Lawyers For Justice will file a class-action lawsuit Tuesday on behalf of injured and arrested protesters, the organization said. The suit will target St. Louis County, Ferguson police and the mayor of Ferguson. Complete coverage of Ferguson shooting and protests . CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin and Rick Martin contributed to this report.","A grand jury is considering whether to bring charges against Officer Darren Wilson .

In her whimsical mash-up of historical fiction and scrapbooking, Caroline Preston uses vintage images and artifacts, paper ephemera and flapper-era souvenirs, to enhance a narrative it appears she pecked out on a manual Corona typewriter. Apparently no junk shop or eBay seller was spared in Preston's search for ways to bring her fictional heroine to life in ""The Scrapbook of Frankie Pratt."" The novel, designed as a memory album, takes Frankie from girlhood in small-town New Hampshire -- cue family photos, magazine biscuit recipes, freckle-cream ads, and an untoward relationship with an older man -- on to graduation from Vassar in 1924. From there, the aspiring writer goes forth into Greenwich Village bohemia and expat adventures in Paris, including an illicit love affair, progressive political associations, flowering feminism, and encounters with famous folk like Ernest Hemingway and James Joyce. But as befits any sprightly ladies' fiction of the era, the greatest surprises await our heroine where she least expects them and teach her a fundamental lesson of early-20th-century life.

By David Guterson . 320 pages; Knopf . Available at: Amazon.com | Barnes & Noble | IndieBound . In his daring novel Ed King, David Guterson reimagines Oedipus Rex in contemporary America. Unlike Oedipus in the original Greek drama, Ed is not royalty per se but the contemporary equivalent: a billionaire tech titan, ""the King of Search."" Born of a fling between a married man and Diane, a much-younger British au pair, baby Ed is left on a stranger's doorstep and soon adopted into a loving family. Ed grows up handsome, intellectually gifted, and powered by a relentless self-confidence. The narrative runs briskly through decades and multiple points of view as Guterson carves a wry edge into Sophocles's tragedy about an abandoned baby who grows up to kill his father and marry his mother. For 27 years, Diane's and Ed's lives run on parallel tracks: she continually reinventing herselfâ€”working as a high-end call girl, dog walker, and, eventually, life coach -- and he graduating Stanford and beginning his conquest of the digital world. When they meet by chance, the attraction is immediate and the implications horrifyingly obvious, though not to the lustily oblivious couple. Guterson acknowledges that readers will be ""shuddering at the prospect"" of these two having sex, but it's worth pushing past the ick factor. Somehow, Guterson keeps the novel winningly good-natured and almost farcical, all the better to teach timeless lessons about hubris, ambition, and the consequences of long-ago sins.

In Holy Ghost Girl, Johnson explores her years of roaming ""the sawdust trail"" of Terrell's revival tents -- canvas ""ad hoc cathedral(s)"" pitched on the edge of Southern towns -- until his ministry grew to include a syndicated radio show, annual missionary trips to India, and a magazine with a 100,000-plus circulation. But as the preacher's fortunes rose, so, too, did his paranoia and greed; at one point, having fathered three children with Carolyn and at least one with another woman, he fell afoul of the IRS and was sentenced to a stint in jail. Yet for all the disaster that seems inevitable from the opening pages of this plainspoken memoir, Johnson still maintains some affection for the part-time charlatan who was often caring and loving to her, as well as an unwitting civil rights activist.

"Beijing (CNN) -- Bowing to intense pressure from local residents, authorities in a southwestern Chinese city abandoned plans to build a controversial billion-dollar chemical plant, the local government announced Tuesday afternoon. Earlier -- defying government orders -- residents of Shifang, in Sichuan Province, continued to rally against the planned construction of a molybdenum copper plant despite an official pledge to halt the project, a protester told CNN. The crowd on the streets thinned considerably after anti-riot police forcibly broke up thousands of protesting residents Monday afternoon, said the protester, who asked that her name not be used for fear of government reprisal. Widely circulated images on Chinese social media sites showed police dispersing unarmed protesters with batons and tear gas, and included images of residents -- including women and the elderly -- covered in blood. In several statements, the Shifang government said 13 residents suffered minor injuries in the clashes Monday but denied anyone had died. Warning residents to end the ""illegal protests"" immediately, authorities also defended police actions as a last-resort response to an increasingly unruly mob. The demonstration started late Sunday, two days after officials broke ground on the controversial $1.6 billion Hongda Molybdenum Copper project, which they insisted had passed all environmental evaluations. Unconvinced local residents, worried about long-term pollution caused by the heavy metal plant, started gathering in the city center to demand the construction be stopped, according to government statements. They were concerned about health problems caused by potentially substantial releases of various toxic pollutants into the local environment. Those pollutants are released into air through smoke, and into ground and water supplies through the slag waste, a byproduct of a refinery's production process that often includes elements like arsenic. Despite rainy weather, the crowd swelled Monday to thousands as angry residents took to the streets, chanting slogans and unfurling banners that read ""protect Shifang's environment and give us back our beautiful home,"" according to photos and videos posted online by protesters. After the mayor's promise to suspend construction failed to reassure the crowd, some demonstrators hurled water bottles and potted plants at police and overturned official vehicles, forcing officers to disperse the crowd with tear gas and stun grenades, the government said. But Chinese residents on the country's social media sites appear to have overwhelmingly supported protesters and their cause, and condemned the local government for its crackdown. Many have also applauded Shifang business owners who posted ""no police allowed"" signs outside their restaurants and stores after Monday's violent clashes. In a subtle sign of its dissatisfaction over local authorities' handling of the situation, the government in Beijing has so far remained largely silent, continuing to allow messages and images of the protest to be uploaded online. Experts say the Shifang episode has again highlighted the rising danger in China's behind-closed-doors environmental evaluation process. ""This is a typical case in which the lack of public participation in the decision-making process leads to greater confusion and conflicts between government and the general public,"" said Ma Jun, a prominent environmentalist and head of the Beijing-based Institute of Public Environmental Affairs. ""In this case, the ideal solution is to re-evaluate the whole project to set an example for the future."" ""Another problem is that there's no guarantee our existing regulations can be faithfully implemented,"" he added. ""We've had similar cases before and now apparently the public awareness has grown significantly."" The protest in Shifang is the latest example of China's urban residents -- long considered the main beneficiaries of the government's economic reforms -- banding together, often via the Internet, to defend their rights. Last August, a large protest prompted authorities in the northeastern port city of Dalian to shut down a controversial chemical plant that produced paraxylene (PX), an allegedly carcinogenic compound used in the production of polyester films and fabrics. In 2008, residents in Shanghai worried about radiation risks took to the streets to protest the construction of a high-speed rail line using the magnetic levitation technology, forcing the government to suspend the project indefinitely. And in 2007, residents in the southeastern city of Xiamen marched against a local PX plant, which eventually moved out of the city.","Residents were worried about the possible release of toxic pollutants from the plant .

"(CNN) -- Italian authorities on Thursday rescued more than 800 migrants from four boats trying to reach the island of Lampedusa, the Italian navy said. As the closest Italian island to Africa, Lampedusa, in the Mediterranean Sea, is a frequent destination for refugees seeking to enter European Union countries, and shipwrecks off its shores are common. Navy and air force helicopters spotted the four boats, which ""appeared in precarious floating conditions and overcrowded,"" the navy said in a statement. The migrants were being transferred to a Navy ship and will be brought to the port of Augusta in Sicily. They were from Africa and countries such as Egypt, Pakistan and Iraq. A day earlier, more than 200 migrants were rescued from the sea and also taken to the port of Augusta. More than 300 African migrants died in October after their ship sank off the island's shores. Days later, another 34 people died when their boat capsized.","More than 800 migrants have been rescued south of Lampedusa .

"(CNN) -- The American people do not like Congress -- and they don't like Congress at historic levels. Gallup polling showed that only 12% of the American people approved of Congress in February. And it's easy to see why. Americans think members of Congress have no interest in listening to them. According to a Public Campaign/Democracy Corps poll, they believe politicians' priorities are first and foremost special interest groups, then campaign contributors, party leaders and the media. listening to their own consciences and their constituents tied for dead last. This isn't cynicism. It's perfectly rational. Think about what we see every day on Capitol Hill. Members of Congress using elective office as little more than a gateway job to something more lucrative on Wall Street or K Street. There's a constantly revolving door of Hill staffers cycling in and out of congressional jobs and high-paying gigs at industry lobby shops. We've all known a cozy relationship exists between legislators and lobbyists. But often they're in the same family. As CNN's Drew Griffin reported for ""AC360ยบ,"" 78 members of Congress can count federally registered lobbyists as family members. Those lobbyists number 100, and according to congressional watchdog Legistorm, they have worked on lobbying contracts worth $2 billion. Republican Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, a member of the Agriculture Subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee, is married to a lobbyist for Kraft Foods, a company that lobbied in 2013 on farm and agriculture bills. Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's son and son-in-law have lobbied Congress on a variety of issues. And this week, Reid faced questions about a payment to his granddaughter for ""gifts"" for his campaign donors -- but he since said he was returning the money to his campaign. The personal conflicts of interest for lawmakers are only exacerbated by another big problem in Washington: Our pay-to-play campaign finance system. A smaller and smaller portion of our population has a bigger and bigger share of the influence over Congress. In the 2012 election cycle, a full 25% of the $6 billion donated to political candidates and committees came from just one ten-thousandth of the U.S. population, according to a Sunlight Foundation analysis. That's roughly the number of people in one New York City ZIP code. It means members of Congress are increasingly dialing for dollars or spending time with people who can write maxed-out checks to their campaigns. Those aren't people back in their districts. They're lobbyists in Washington and bankers in New York. So far in 2014, the Washington metro area is the biggest giver to campaigns -- listed above all the states -- even though the residents of the District of Columbia have no voting representative. The system creates a political inequality that leaves those unable to write big checks left out. It's not what our Founding Fathers had in mind. We need to return to a government that is truly of, by and for the people, not bought and paid for by big money donors and special interests. There are ways we can turn the tide and get back to the kind of government we the people deserve. We need to strengthen revolving-door policies to make it harder for members of Congress and their staffs to shuffle in and out of Hill offices and swanky jobs in industry lobby firms. We need to enact stronger conflict-of-interest standards for family members of our elected officials. And most importantly, we need to have a campaign finance system that enhances the power of ordinary citizens through small donor-driven public financing of elections. Two bills recently introduced in Congress show us the path forward. In the House of Representatives, Democrat Rep. John Sarbanes of Maryland has introduced the Government by the People Act, and in the Senate, Democrat Majority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois has introduced the Fair Elections Now Act. Both bills would use a refundable tax credit and matching funds on small donations to help lessen the influence of big money in our elections and empower everyday people. Candidates for Congress could forgo the constant fundraising from wealthy donors and special interest lobbyists, avoid the perception of being in their pockets and focus on representing the interests of their constituents. In other words, to do the jobs that they're elected to do in the first place. In New York, a campaign to win similar legislation in that scandal-ridden state is just a handful of votes from passage. The American people have are fed up and don't trust Congress. It's time to turn that anger into action by getting behind efforts to fix our broken system with common sense solutions. If we do, we can once again have a government that represents exactly what our founders intended: we the people. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nick Nyhart.","The American people do not like Congress at historic levels and believe money rules .

"(CNN) -- Manchester United spent almost $300,000 on a World Cup winner's medal owned by one of the English soccer club's former players at an auction on Wednesday. Nobby Stiles, a member of England's winning team in 1966, received a total of £424,438 ($669,000) after putting his collection of memorabilia up for sale. United paid £188,200 ($297,000) for the 68-year-old's medal, which surpassed the £165,00 (£260,000) paid for the medal owned by Stiles' 1966 teammate Alan Ball in 2005. Scottish auction house Convery, which was involved in both those sales, said it was a new world-record price for a football medal at auction. Convery said United bought 10 of Stiles' 45 lots, including his 1968 European Cup winner's medal for £49,402 ($78,000). The shirt the midfielder wore in that final against Portuguese club Benfica sold for £30,582 ($48,000) and his cap from the 1966 Wembley match brought in £35,287 ($55,000). Stiles played 395 times for United from 1960-71 during a 15-year career that later saw him join Middlesbrough and Preston. He had a reputation as a tough-tackling player, whose appearance on the pitch seemed even more fearsome as he did not wear his dentures -- thus exposing the gaps in his teeth. ""We're delighted to have acquired these items, which possess tremendous historical significance for Manchester United and English football, and look forward to proudly displaying them in our museum,"" said a statement on the club's website. Convery said the shirt worn by Ball in 1966 -- and subsequently swapped after the match with Stiles -- was sold for £51,755 ($86,000) at the same auction, which attracted worldwide interest from regions including Australia, Chile and the Far East.","Manchester United to exhibit Nobby Stiles' memorabilia in club museum after auction .

"Washington (CNN) -- Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon traveled to Washington last week expecting to see top Obama administration officials. Instead, he found himself with a lot of time on his hands. The White House denied him meetings with Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of State John Kerry and National Security Adviser Susan Rice. Senior administration officials attributed the snub to numerous negative comments Ya'alon made earlier this year criticizing the administration in general and Kerry in particular. ""It shouldn't have been a surprise given some of his comments,"" a senior administration official said about Ya'alon's visit. ""We give you $1.3 billion of aid and you are dumping on us. None of our friends have been disrespectful to the extent of Israel."" He was granted meetings with Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Still, the episode offers a startling illustration of how badly relations have deteriorated between the U.S. and Israel -- long-term allies -- because of irritation with Ya'alon. It also reflects years of pent-up frustration in the White House over Israel's role in the Middle East peace process. In January, the Obama administration -- and indeed many of Ya'alon's fellow Israeli politicians -- were apoplectic when he was quoted in Israeli media calling Kerry ""obsessive and messianic,"" in his efforts to forge a peace deal between Israelis and Palestinians. Ya'alon added he hoped Kerry ""gets a Nobel Prize and leaves us alone."" Ya'alon apologized after protests by Washington and a strong rebuke from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But tensions grew again in March, when Ya'alon harshly criticized the way the Obama administration was dealing with Iran, saying the president was trying to leave the issue for his successor to deal with. David Makovsky, an advisor to former US peace envoy Martin Indyk who now works at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said that while he does not believe Israel is currently trying to accentuate its differences with the United States, the resentments on both sides are bubbling over. ""It's an accumulation of baggage that each side has carried for some time,"" Makovsky said ""What I see is the wear and tear of these six years working together where the sum of the problems becomes greater than the parts on policy. It's sad."" In addition to the public dissing of Kerry, who spent the better part of a year in a failed effort to broker a framework agreement between Israelis and Palestinians, officials said Israel's inflexibility on security arrangements proposed for the plan by General John Allen further aggravated the already strained ties. But the biggest culprit, the officials said, is continued Israeli settlement construction in defiance of continued American objections. Washington has warned Israel against such unilateral moves that could prejudice the outcome of a future peace deal. The row over settlements turned ugly last month after Netanyahu left Washington amid news of settlement expansion in the West Bank. When the prime minister said that U.S. objections to Israeli settlement activity went against American values, the White House slapped him down, calling the criticism ""odd."" ""It's clear how American values dictate or at least guide our thinking,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. On Monday, Netanyahu announced Israel would fast-track planning for more than 1,000 new apartments in East Jerusalem, prompting swift and strong condemnation from the State Department, which said it was ""deeply concerned"" by the announcement. ""If Israel wants to live in a peaceful society, they need to take steps that will reduce tensions,"" said State Department Spokesperson Jen Psaki. ""Moving forward with this sort of action would be incompatible with the pursuit of peace."" In a phone call this weekend, Kerry warned Netanyahu against going ahead with the planned settlement units. He also pressed the prime minister to speed up an investigation of last week's killing of a Palestinian American teen by Israeli forces. ""He told him it can't be business as usual where these things drag on and then don't say anything,"" one U.S. official said. Several U.S. officials said a growing frustration with Israel on a host of issues has prompted a discussion within the administration about how to best to express it . ""We are in the process of re-evaluating exactly that question,"" one senior administration official said, adding ""various options are being drafted."" The tension comes as several important decision points related to Israel are coming to a head. The U.S. must decide how it will respond to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's proposal to the United Nations to declare a Palestinian state, something Israel is adamantly opposed to but an idea that has growing support in Europe. Washington must also weigh how much effort to expend on dissuading its European allies from taking tougher measures against Israel such as boycotting products made in settlements or sanctioning Israeli companies that do business in what is considered occupied territory. ""There is a ton the U.S. does behind the scenes,"" another senior administration official said. ""We bail them out of everything - pushing back the Europeans, pushing back at the UN. We are their last good friend in the world."" The officials, who all spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak with candor, stressed that the US remains fully committed to Israel's security and all policy decisions are made from that starting point. But they add that the unequivocal political support the U.S. expends to Israel may not always be a given. ""We will never, ever stop funding for Iron Dome or withhold anything that is related in any way to their security, but the question is, how much do we continue to do politically?"" an official said. ""It is easy to do less on that front while making sure it doesn't impact our security relationship.""","The White House snubbed the Israeli defense minister when he traveled to Washington .

"Washington (CNN) -- LifeWay Christian Bookstores has removed a Bible from its shelves because the Bible helped raise money for the Susan G. Komen Foundation, which in turn ""funds Planned Parenthood"" breast cancer programs. The Bible, which was published by B&H Publishing Group, was sold with the stipulation that $1 from the sale of each Bible would go to the Komen Foundation. The foundation says on its website it gives money to Planned Parenthood, stating that funds from the foundation go to ""Planned Parenthood-sponsored breast cancer health programs."" When Lifeway realized they were donating to a foundation that also donated to Planned Parenthood, they released a statement stating they ""made a mistake."" ""When our leadership discovered the overwhelming concern that some of Komen's affiliates were giving funds to Planned Parenthood, we began the arduous process of withdrawing this Bible from the market,"" stated a release by Thom S. Rainer, president and CEO of LifeWay. ""Though we have assurances that Komen's funds are used only for breast cancer screening and awareness, it is not in keeping with LifeWay's core values to have even an indirect relationship with Planned Parenthood."" The issue had become a cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre for anti-abortion advocates around the country, including the websites LifeNews.com and Bound4Life.com. After Lifeway Christian Bookstores announced they were removing the Bible, Steven Ertelt, the founder of the website, posted a call to action for his readers. ""Take a few minutes to say thanks,"" read a post on the website. Bound4Life issued a similar post. ""Thank you, Mr. Rainer and LifeWay for doing the right thing,"" wrote Susan Tyrrell, editor of the website. ""We can pray the controversy will bring more awareness to Komen's unwise giving practices."" This is not the first time the Komen Foundation has been questioned about its connection with Planned Parenthood. The foundation issued a June 2011 statement that further clarified its association with ""19 Planned Parenthood programs."" ""In all cases, Komen funding is used exclusively to provide breast cancer programs, including clinical breast exams conducted by trained medical personnel,"" stated the release. ""It's important to note that Komen will only make grants to non-profit organizations. As many mammography providers are for-profit entities, we are only to fund mammography services through grants made to local non-profit service providers."" As long as there are vulnerable communities in need, concluded the release, ""Komen will fund the facilities that can best meet those needs."" In light of the Bibles' removal, LifeWay has pledged to ""continue to seek innovative ways that are in keeping with LifeWay's core values.""","Lifeway said the sale of the Bible violated its core values .

"(CNN) -- A new global racing series is launching with hopes of rivaling Formula One, but there is one major difference -- the cars will all have electric engines. The Formula E series has been backed by Jean Todt, president of motorsport's world governing body the Federation Internationale del'Automobile (FIA). The former Ferrari F1 chief has signed an agreement with a group of investors to stage a series of races on city-center tracks. The investors, who already have Rio de Janeiro signed up as a host city, plan to have 10 teams and 20 drivers ready to race in 2014, following a year of testing. ""This new competition at the heart of major cities is certain to attract a new audience,"" Todt told the FIA website. ""This spectacular series will offer both entertainment and a new opportunity to share the FIA values and objectives of clean energy, mobility and sustainability with a wider and younger audience as well."" Formula E's cars will be based around a prototype designed by French company Formulec. The 780 kg vehicles will have a maximum speed of 220 kmh (137 mph) and run on a lithium-iron battery that can provide 25 minutes' racing. The chairman of the new series will be Alejandro Agag, who already supports teams in the FIA's GP2 and GP3 series. ""We see this as a great opportunity to create a new and exciting spectacle mixing racing, clean energy and sustainability, looking to the future,"" Agag said. ""We expect this championship to become the framework for research and development around the electric car, a key element for the future of our cities."" The FIA has been eager to encourage motorsport to lead the motor industry in harnessing the potential of electric engines, with innovations such as the KERS system -- which harnesses braking energy to provide an engine boost every lap -- already being adapted to mass production cars. From 2014, Formula One pit lanes will have to be electric only.","FIA president Jean Todt signs agreement to launch series in 2014 .

"(CNN) -- ""We struggled so much in life,"" says Olga Moran, a wife and mother of three from an impoverished village near Otavalo, Ecuador. ""We made very little. It wasn't enough. So, one day we started making necklaces with seeds,"" she said. Moran says that with the help of American entrepreneur Amanda Judge, she has turned her life around, selling her jewelry in the United States, making her family better off. For Judge, The Andean Collection started as an academic project as she researched ways to help women out of poverty in rural Ecuadorian villages. ""I didn't see ways to increase the income in agriculture or farming, carpentry,"" Judge said. ""However, I did see income potential in crafts."" She has encouraged the artisans to experiment with new designs which she believed would allow her to expand the business from local to international markets. In 2008, the theory went into practice. ""They don't live hand to mouth any more. They have savings, they have consumer goods, they have TVs, they have cars,"" Judge said. ""They work from their homes, they don't have to get up and carry bags of 10 pounds of grain to the market...and come back only when they have sold enough to eat for the day."" The business has changed Moran's life. ""I spend time with my children, my husband, my home. I couldn't do that before,"" Moran said. And with more means, she hopes to offer her children a better life. In the future she hopes that they can go on to study, so they won't have to endure what she has. Judge says all the accessories in the Andean Collection are made with local seeds harvested in the Ecuadorian rainforest and lowlands. ""The three main types are acai, tambi and tagua,"" she said. ""Using these natural materials promotes harvest growth because it allows the farmers who harvest the seeds to get a living out of their lands -- instead of selling the land to oil companies or logging it for the wood. ""So it actually promotes forest growth."" Judge now works with 40 artisans and besides bringing social change to their families she has seen her business take off. Chic and green, these accessories are now being sold in 1,500 stores worldwide, as well as making a difference to the lives of the people who make them -- Moran included. ""I am so grateful. I don't know how to express it,"" Moran said.","American entrepreneur helping impoverished families in Ecuador sell their jewelry .

"Washington (CNN) -- In what amounted to political theater rather than legislative action, the Senate on Wednesday rejected a House budget plan that included a controversial provision to overhaul Medicare and also unanimously voted down President Barack Obama's 2012 budget proposal. The House budget measure had been expected to fail in the Senate due to overwhelming opposition by majority Democrats, plus wavering support for its Medicare overhaul among Republicans. The Senate GOP has recognized the provision's unpopularity with senior citizens enrolled in the government-run health insurance program. Senate Democrats forced Wednesday's vote in order to make Senate Republicans go on record in support of the Medicare overhaul. The final vote on the proposal originated by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, was 57-40, mostly along party lines. Republicans who joined the majority Democrats in opposing the measure were Scott Brown of Massachusetts, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine. Three senators didn't vote -- Republicans Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas and Pat Roberts of Kansas, and Democrat Chuck Schumer of New York. In a later retaliatory vote forced by Republicans, the Senate achieved rare bipartisan unanimity in rejecting Obama's budget plan on a 97-0 vote. The defeat was expected. Democrats joined Republicans in opposing the plan to signal they wanted a stronger deficit reduction proposal than what the president offered. The Senate then defeated two other Republican budget plans offered by conservative newcomers Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Paul. Ryan's plan, which won approval in the House due to strong Republican support, drew the most attention of the proposals defeated Wednesday because of its provision to rework Medicare starting in 2022. On Tuesday, Democrats won a special election for a U.S. House seat from upstate New York formerly considered safe Republican territory, and the Republican Medicare plan was the central issue of the campaign. Under the Ryan proposal, the government would no longer directly pay health care bills for senior citizens in the program, starting in 2022. Instead, recipients would choose a plan from a list of private providers, which the federal government would subsidize. People now 55 or older would not be affected by the changes. The budget proposal also would slash non-military discretionary spending and reform Medicaid, the government-run health insurance program for the poor and disabled. Republicans call Ryan's proposal a courageous attempt to address runaway spending that must be corralled to bring down rising deficits and a ballooning national debt. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus blasted Democrats for stopping ""at nothing to preserve the status quo in Washington, which is propelling our country towards bankruptcy."" Priebus' remarks reflected the fact that the question of how to tackle the growth of hugely popular entitlement programs -- including Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security -- has now become one of the central battlegrounds in the national political arena. Democrats, however, contend Republicans seek to reduce deficits on the backs of the elderly and the poor by essentially ending Medicare as it now operates. They note the Medicare overhaul will cost senior citizens an average of roughly $6,000 more per year for health care. ""The Republican plan would kill Medicare,"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said Wednesday. Democrats pointed to the New York special election results on Tuesday as evidence that the American people, especially senior citizens, don't agree with the Republican approach. In the election, Kathy Hochul, the Democratic clerk of Erie County, swept to victory in the race to fill the U.S. House seat previously held by Republican Chris Lee in a district controlled by the GOP for more than four decades. During Hochul's victory speech Tuesday night, jubilant supporters repeatedly chanted ""Medicare! Medicare!"" Hochul pledged to help balance the budget ""the right way, not on backs of our seniors."" Throughout the campaign, Hochul highlighted the national fight, telling CNN that her Republican opponent, Jane Corwin, had ""100% embraced"" the plan. Corwin called Hochul's message ""scare tactics,"" and had argued that Hochul was ""trying to put out the idea that I'm trying to end Medicare."" ""There's nothing further from the truth,"" Corwin insisted. ""I'm working to protect Medicare."" Moments after Hochul's victory was announced, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, the newly installed head of the Democratic National Committee, declared that the outcome of the race proves ""Republicans and independent voters, along with Democrats, will reject extreme policies."" On Wednesday morning, Guy Cecil, executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, released a statement arguing that the results ""provide clear evidence that Senate Democrats will be able to play offense in Senate races across the country by remaining focused on the Republican effort to end Medicare."" For their part, Republican leaders minimized the importance of the race. Among other things, they pointed to the presence of a conservative third-party candidate in the race whose support apparently exceeded Hochul's margin of victory. Republican Sen. John Thune of South Dakota said his party has to promote its budget policies and the Medicare overhaul proposal instead of voting for it and then absorbing Democratic attacks. ""The talking point is there was a third-party candidate who drew 12% and spent $2 million,"" Thune said of the New York race, adding that supporters of the Ryan plan in the House and Senate now ""need to get out there and aggressively get on offense and explain it to the American people."" To Thune, the Republicans made a courageous vote and now Democrats are ""starting to lob grenades at us and everybody's starting to duck and run for cover."" ""I don't think that's the way you engage in a fight,"" Thune said. ""We have to get out there and fight."" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said the real problem is that Democrats have failed to propose or pass a budget proposal for last year or this one. ""This is a complete and total abdication of their responsibilities,"" McConnell said. To hit back at Democrats, McConnell forced votes Wednesday on the other three budget measures, including Obama's 2012 budget proposal. McConnell sought to force Democrats to publicly oppose Obama's plan and to also reject other Republican proposals in order to portray them as obstructing any progress on cutting deficits. In a bit of political irony, GOP leaders last year repeatedly attacked the health care reform law pushed through by Democrats, arguing that it would weaken Medicare. Republican congressional candidates crushed their Democratic counterparts among voters age 65 and older in the November congressional elections, carrying seniors by a 21-point margin. Whether Republicans can now successfully defend Ryan's plan, which is a virtual litmus test for their conservative base, without scaring older voters remains to be seen. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, now a presidential candidate, was recently excoriated by conservative activists for calling Ryan's plan a form of objectionable ""right-wing social engineering."" Gingrich has since backed away from his remarks and expressed support for the proposal.

"(CNN) -- Unfurl the Stars and Stripes. Crank up the Star Spangled banner. Home fans at next month's United States Grand Prix in Texas will have an American driver to cheer on for the first time. Californian Alexander Rossi is set to drive in first practice on November 15 for the Caterham Formula One team. There has not yet been an official announcement from the team but CNN understands the 22-year-old will become the first American driver to take part in a grand prix weekend at the Circuit of the Americas. Rossi is the only American racer involved in F1 and the first to hit the track since Scott Speed in 2007. The track outside Austin was developed and designed as the new home of the U.S. Grand Prix, which returned to the calendar in 2012 after a five year hiatus. Rossi is Caterham's reserve driver and is currently racing for Caterham Racing in F1's feeder GP2 Series. At this year's Canadian Grand Prix, Rossi reacquainted himself with an F1 car by competing in first practice. Interactive: A Ferrari steering wheel . Rossi told CNN at last year's inaugural U.S. Grand Prix in Austin: ""Americans are very patriotic and they want someone to support. ""In order to entice more fans, and to allow F1 to compete with Nascar and IndyCar, there needs to be an American driver."" Speed was the last American to compete in F1 but it's been six years since he lost his Toro Rosso seat to reigning triple world champion Sebastian Vettel. The country has produced two F1 world champions in Phil Hill (1961) and Mario Andretti (1978). The return of the U.S. to the sport's global calendar in 2012 was a much needed boost for F1 in North America's motorsport hierarchy. An inaugural grand prix on the streets of New Jersey has also been included in 2014's record breaking 22 race calendar. But the race, scheduled for June 1, has a provisional status which means it could still be dropped from the sport's global tour.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Navy confirmed Wednesday that it did an abrupt about-face on guidance allowing same-sex marriages on military bases after receiving a flood of criticism from Capitol Hill, as well as discussions with Defense Department lawyers. The guidance -- outlined in a memorandum last month from the Navy chief of chaplains, Rear Adm. M.L. Tidd -- would have eased the way for same-sex marriage ceremonies once the Pentagon scraps its present ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy. ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell,"" which bars gays and lesbians from serving openly in the armed forces, is expected to be officially lifted later this year. Tidd said Tuesday that his memo, originally issued on April 13, was suspended ""until further notice pending additional legal and policy review and inter-Departmental coordination."" Tidd's plan gave a green light to the use of base facilities for same-sex ceremonies in states that allow either same-sex marriage or civil unions.  It said chaplains' participation in such ceremonies would depend on whether it was ""consistent with the tenets of his or her religious"" beliefs. Some critics of the plan warned it would violate the federal Defense of Marriage Act. ""There was some attention on the Hill,"" Pentagon spokesman Col. Dave Lapan told reporters Wednesday morning.  ""That raised the issue so that the (Pentagon) legal counsel then again took a look (and) determined it needed further review."" The Navy's surprise switch energized both supporters and opponents of ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell."" One prominent defender of the law -- Elaine Donnelly, head of the Center for Military Readiness -- said the controversy should push Congress to intervene quickly. ""Congress should not be misled by the Navy's equivocation,"" Donnelly said.  ""This weather-vane policy is likely to change back as soon as all the branches of service get on board and Congress looks the other way. ""Congress must intervene since the Defense Department lawyers don't know -- or don't want to tell -- what they are doing,"" she said. On the other side of the issue, Servicemembers United Executive Director Alexander Nicholson insisted the Navy was within its rights on same-sex marriage policy. Nicholson said the Pentagon should not be distracted by ""pressure from reactionaries."" ""At a time when the economy still needs attention, Osama bin Laden was just killed, and revolution and conflict continue to rage across a fragile Middle East, having policy makers spend valuable and limited time on whether a few gay couples may or may not use a Navy facility for a private ceremony at some point in the future is just plain silly,"" Nicholson said in a statement sent to CNN. ""The Navy was right in their analysis last month that nothing stands in the way of operating facilities without discrimination, and further review will no doubt validate that position,"" said Michael Cole-Schwartz, a spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, which supports same-sex marriage. ""While some lawmakers are dragging out scare tactics, there is nothing controversial in allowing facilities to be operated in a nondiscriminatory manner,"" he said. It remains unclear what same-sex marriage policies the other services might be considering or ultimately adopt. As for ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell,"" top Pentagon officials have indicated they expect to be ready to implement a repeal of the policy by midsummer. Clifford Stanley -- the Defense Department under secretary tasked with overseeing the repeal -- told members of a House Armed Services subcommittee in April that the process will not be rushed ""because we want to make sure that it's done right."" But ""at the same time, we don't want to take forever to do it,"" he said. President Barack Obama, Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm.

"(CNN) -- Somali government forces and African Union troops pushed al Qaeda-linked militants out of its last outpost in the western part of Mogadishu, opening the main artery to the famed Bakaara Market, the African Union Mission to Somalia said Friday. It's the latest action in a months-long military campaign designed to push al-Shabaab fighters out of the Somali capital. African Union peacekeeping forces, who have been operating under a U.N. mandate, say the military action is designed to inhibit al-Shabaab's ability to hide behind civilians and limit civilian casualties, the African Union has said. The capture Thursday of Damanyo, a militant outpost in western Mogadishu, opens one of the city's main arteries to the famed Bakaara Market, the African Union said in statement released Friday. The market is the city's commercial hub and the site where one of two U.S. Blackhawk helicopters were downed by militants in 1993. Raging street battles in the capital since February have pitted government troops, backed by the African Union, against the jihadist movement al-Shabaab, which controls much of southern Somalia. Al-Shabaab is waging a war against Somalia's government in an effort to implement a stricter form of Islamic law, or sharia. Somalia has not had a stable government since 1991, and fighting between the rebels and government troops has escalated the humanitarian crisis in the famine-ravaged country . The peacekeeping force is charged with protecting key government and strategic installations in Mogadishu, including the port, airport and presidential palace. It is the de facto military force of the weak, transitional Somali government. CNN's David McKenzie contributed to this report.","Forces have pushed militants out of the last outpost in western Mogadishu, officials say .

"Washington (CNN) -- Are American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS comparable to labor unions and MoveOn.org? Democratic activists scoff at the question. But Steven Law, Crossroads' CEO, says yes. ""American Crossroads was conceived as an answer to the hundreds of millions of dollars that unions and MoveOn.org and other groups on the left have been spending for years to support Democrats,"" Law said. ""So we started American Crossroads because we thought there ought to be a way for us to try and level the playing field."" Adam Ruben, political director for Moveon.org, says it's a fundamentally different approach to political engagement. ""Their money is secret. It comes in seven-figure chunks. That gives them a fundamentally different role in our democracy,"" Ruben said, explaining that Moveon.org's average donation is $28. ""A group that exists for ultra-rich people to essentially buy elections is counter to the American democratic tradition."" The labor unions that invested the most in the 2010 elections say they collectively spent $177 million on political activities (the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees: $93 million; the Service Employees International Union: $44 million; the National Education Association: $40 million). In the same cycle, the top three Republican outside spending groups spent $147 million on political activities (American Crossroads and GPS: $71 million; the U.S. Chamber of Commerce: $50 million; the American Action Network: $26 million). In terms of dollars spent, labor unions are competitive. But it's worth looking at the differences between the groups and how that affects their disclosure laws. American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS are divided because one is public and one is private. American Crossroads, the super PAC, can raise unlimited amounts but has to declare its donors. It can make hard-hitting, explicitly political ads. The private arm is Crossroads GPS, a 501(c)(4) organization that doesn't have to disclose its donors. This group has to live by different rules. More than half of its ads can't be explicitly political; they have to promote a specific issue. Since GPS is private, the IRS is the only government agency that monitors its activity. Labor unions raise money for political spending through voluntary contributions from members to their PACs and use money from their general fund that comes from dues. They are not required to report all their political spending to the Federal Election Commission. But the Bush administration's Department of Labor passed far-reaching rules requiring that they disclose all their political giving, so their election-related activities are public. But those aren't the only differences. Labor union representatives argue that the two Crossroads groups spend their money overwhelmingly on ads, not on get-out-the-vote efforts and advocating for safer work environments, which, union representatives argue, enhance democracy. Representatives from Crossroads say they are experimenting with new ways to get out the vote online and through technology but acknowledge that it doesn't approach the boots-on-the-ground power the unions have. GPS also spends money supporting other groups that share its less-regulation/lower-tax agenda, which they believe also contributes to society but from a different political perspective. Still, union representatives scoff at any comparison on principle. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees political director Larry Scanlon said, ""Karl Rove has taken advantage of campaign finance loopholes to create a shadowy network of front groups that can raise and spend unlimited, undisclosed funds to promote anti-worker candidates and an issue agenda that attempts to silence the political voice of working people. ""Conservative groups like Crossroads outspent liberal ones by a 2-1 margin in the 2010 cycle and are poised to spend even more in 2012. In contrast, everything AFSCME spends on behalf of its 1.6 million members is above board and disclosed. We will never match what the corporate interests and wealthy individuals spend, but we have the facts on our side, and we have real live people, not Mitt Romney's 'corporate people,' on our side."" But Law maintains that Crossroads is ""very open"" about its activities. ""We're very proud about what we do. We pursue what we're doing ethically; we have a strong agenda of good policies we think are good for the country, and we want to be very open about how we're doing it and what we're doing and where we're doing it,"" Law said. That 2-1 spending figure is based on a study by Open Secrets.org at the Center for Responsive Politics. Open Secrets gathers its numbers only from reports to the Federal Election Commission, which does not capture all election spending. ""Labor unions are allowed to engage in a variety of politics-related activities that don't meet the definitions of what gets reported to the FEC,"" Open Secrets said. ""The numbers on OpenSecrets.org could be more conservative than what the unions themselves say they spent."" Paco Fabian, spokesman for Change to Win, a coalition of labor unions, disagrees. ""The comparison is laughable. You have, on the one hand, a handful of billionaires and corporations fund Crossroads and Crossroads GPS. They are the voice of the 1 percent. On the other hand, you have millions of workers coming together and supporting a handful of unions, the voice of the 99 percent. Union members have ensured that all American workers labor under safe conditions, with fair pay and benefits for a hard day's work. That's why we have weekends."" Super PACs and 501(c)(4)s are not limited to the right. Democrats have them, too. There's a crop of new Democratic super PACs: Majority PAC, House Majority PAC and Priorities USA, which as of last filing had not been able to raise nearly the money the Republican PACs have. Law is unfazed by the criticism, saying, ""Nobody thought that was controversial when they're helping Democrats. You know, now we're leveling the playing field somewhat, and obviously Democrats are upset about that."" This is the first presidential election since the Supreme Court ruled in Citizens United that corporations can make unlimited gifts to all of these groups, making it a test run for a potentially new era of big money in politics. The next filing deadline for the FEC is January 31, so we'll learn more about how much money has been raised then -- at least for those groups that have to report.","How does labor union political activity square up with super PAC?

"(CNN) -- A raging wildfire near the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico has prompted the evacuation of more than 10,000 residents in the town as firefighters battle hot temperatures and high winds, authorities said Monday. An estimated 8,000 people were expected to evacuate Monday, according to Kelly Stewart, a spokeswoman for Los Alamos County. Around 3,000 people left their homes after officials issued a voluntary order Sunday night, she said. The Las Conchas fire, which flared up over the weekend, was reported to be approximately a mile from the lab's southwestern boundary Monday afternoon, according to a statement on InciWeb, an online interagency database that tracks fires, floods and other disasters. The fire, which has spread across nearly 44,000 acres, is burning to the north and northeast. It is 0% contained. Additionally, a one-acre spot fire was reported on the lab's property, at its southern boundary, according to Kevin Roark, a spokesman for the facility. ""We are maintaining a very watchful eye on these fires ... Our facilities are not threatened at this point,"" he said. ""It's an unhappy thing, but we are confident in our ability to handle this threat."" Los Alamos, a center of American nuclear science, is one of the nation's top national-security research facilities. The fire near the lab has raised concerns about whether hazardous materials kept there are being adequately guarded. Authorities say there are. ""They have anticipated the problem of fire and they've taken precautions,"" Sen. Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico told CNN Monday. ""The structures that are central to the operation of the laboratory are well protected."" The lab is about 35 miles northwest of Santa Fe, New Mexico, on 36 square miles of property owned by the Department of Energy. More than 11,000 employees work at the facility. It was closed Monday to nonessential employees and will remain closed on Tuesday because of the risks presented by the fire. The lab is a joint project of Bechtel National, the University of California, The Babcock & Wilcox Company, and the Washington Division of URS, and is operated for the Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration.

"(CNN) -- Tens of thousands of people marched through Chile's capital Thursday, demanding lower tuition and other reforms in the nation's education system. Police said at least 70,000 people took to the streets in Santiago, CNN Chile reported. Some protesters hurled stones at authorities as riot police sprayed tear gas and water cannons at demonstrators. The march drew the attention of Chilean Education Minister Joaquin Lavin. ""The violence worries me. We cannot allow it. The possibility that some children and youth will miss the school year worries me. Every time there are protests, there are stoppages, instead of improving public education, we are hurting it,"" he said. ""We cannot keep missing classes. Please, I want to call for prudence. On the path we are on, education will not be fixed."" But protest organizers said massive marches were necessary to make the government take notice. ""The education policies must be redesigned,"" Jaime Gajardo, president of the College of Professors, told CNN Chile. ""We cannot continue on this path of privatization.""

"(CNN) -- The scene of some of the bloodiest fighting from the First World War will be commemorated by this year's Tour de France. A hundred years after the start of the global conflict and the first battle of Ypres, the Flemish town will host stage five of cycling's blue-riband event. During World War 1 there were three battle at Ypres, with over 900,000 British, French and German casualties. It is a nod by Tour organisers to a conflict that had a major bearing on the race. For four years -- from 1915 to 1918 -- the race was cancelled while some of its first overall victors lost their lives in the war, namely Francois Faber, Octave Lapize and Lucien Petit-Breton. The modern-day focal point for Ypres violent past is the Menin Gate, completed in 1927, and a memorial to the British and Commonwealth soldiers that lost their lives in what today is a relatively sleepy town with a population of just 35,000 people. ""We of course cannot forget them. The Tour is also a moment of collective remembrance,"" said Tour director Christian Prudhomme. From a racing perspective, the stage could have a significant impact on the race as it boasts nine cobblestone sections along part of the route of the classic day race Paris-Roubaix, often referred to as ""the Hell of the North"". The last time the Tour visited sustained periods of cobbles during the 2010 race, it resulted in a litany of crashes and the exit of some notable Tour contenders, namely Frank Schleck. When defending Tour champion Chris Froome was asked to come up with is ideal Tour route last week, he admitted he wanted plenty of time trials and no cobblestones. Revelation of this 2014 route -- starting in the UK town of Leeds and finishing in Paris -- was not quite the antithesis of the defending champion's dream Tour but there was a sense organisers were perhaps trying to halt the British hegemony and a possible hat-trick of British winners after Bradley Wiggins success in 2012. The route boasts just 33.5 kilometres against the clock -- the smallest amount for 80 years. That said, it comes on the penultimate stage, thereby giving Froome one final throw of the dice should he have a deficit to make up. More precariously lying in wait is the aforementioned cobblestones. Prior to the route announcement, Froome had said: ""What worries me about cobbles are the crashes, the mechanical problems. A mechanical problem in the wrong moment of the race when things are kicking off could lead to you losing the Tour. ""I'm not a big fan of that. It's the unknown factor that worries me about the cobbles."" More positively for Froome is the volume of mountainous terrain scheduled for the route. This summer, he showed he was comfortably the best climber in the field, so the 2014 race's five mountain-top finishes should play to his strengths. This year, the Alps first lies in wait, some of it familiar territory for Froome, including La Planche des Belles Filles, scene of his first stage win in the Tour. Arguably the toughest terrain, however, is the Pyrenean stages that follow. For the second time in the race's history it will begin in Britain, this time in the county of Yorkshire, the Grand Depart (the official start of the race) taking place in its major city Leeds. Froome's defence of the yellow jersey, handed out to the Tour leader, is likely to come notably from this year's runner-up Nairo Quintana as well as Italian Vicenzo Nibali and former winner Alberto Contador. Sprinter Mark Cavendish will be hoping to add to the British success on home soil by winning the first stage in Harrogate where his mother lives.","Route for 2014 Tour de France is unveiled at glitzy ceremony in French capital Paris .

"(CNN)  -- Stefan Kiessling grabbed a hat-trick as Bayer Leverkusen reclaimed top spot in the Bundesliga with a 4-0 home victory over Stuttgart on Sunday. The convincing win lifted them three points clear of Werder Bremen, who had taken over at the summit on goal difference with a 2-2 draw with defending champions VfL Wolfsburg on Saturday. But undefeated Leverkusen made no mistake with the Bundesliga top scorer Kiessling leading the way for Jupp Heynckes' men after 22 minutes. Tony Kroos' free-kick found Sami Hyypia, who headed into the path of Kiessling and he volleyed home from close range. Kroos hit the post in the 32nd minute then made the second goal seven minutes later with a diagonal pass to Eren Derdiyok, who headed past Jens Lehmann from eight meters. Stuttgart, under Markus Babbel, won in the Champions League at Rangers in midweek, but are without a Bundesliga win in sixth games, and showed few signs they could mount a second half recovery. Roberto Hilbert shot into the side-netting for the visitors, but Kiessling put the game out of reach on the hour mark, fastening onto another assist from the excellent Kroos to score the third. He sealed his hat-trick in the 87th minute from the penalty spot after Lehmann had pulled down Derdiyok. Later on Sunday, Bayern Munich eased a little of the pressure on coach Louis van Gaal with a 3-0 win over Hannover to move to fourth in the Bundesliga. Thomas Muller put Bayern ahead in the 19th minute and Croatian Ivica Olic added the second two minutes after the break. A Mario Gomez strike in the 90th minute sealed the victory after van Gaal had been reportedly told by the club's director of sport Christian Nerlinger that he must win the final four games of 2009 to keep hold of his job.","Unbeaten Bayer Leverkusen beat Stuttgart 4-0 in Bundesliga .

"(CNN) -- The federal government shutdown is a virtually unprecedented move by a political minority committed to rolling back one of the most significant legislative achievements in recent American history. The Affordable Care Act of 2010 was passed by two houses of Congress after 14 months of debate. Opponents then challenged the law's constitutionality and lost that battle in the Supreme Court of the United States. Less than five months later, American voters re-elected by a 5 million-vote majority margin a president who stood foursquare behind the Affordable Care Act. In so doing, the electorate rejected a GOP presidential candidate who promised its repeal. Apparently the democratic processes by which Americans make choices and govern themselves are not acceptable to extremists in the House of Representatives who seek to halt government or have their way. They would have Americans see their actions as a patriotic and high-minded defense of liberty. As the shutdown loomed, several GOP congressmen and analysts took to the airwaves to trivialize the significance of the House vote. Some cited previous episodes to suggest that closing the federal government is a normal byproduct of the American people having ""a very deep disagreement about the future of our country."" Rep. Sean Duffy, a Wisconsin Republican and member of the House Budget Committee, took a different tack and in so doing revealed what was really under way.  Duffy insisted that President Obama was guilty of recalcitrance in the face of reasonable House Republicans who simply sought a workable compromise. ""We have moved over the last week,"" Duffy insisted in an interview with CNN's Piers Morgan. ""We first had a defund Obamacare bill. We then moved to a delay Obamacare bill. And tonight ... we said 'let's delay the individual mandate. '"" Each step, in fact, had been an effort to shatter what the democratic process had painstakingly achieved. Such rhetorical sleights of hand should not obscure the very radical departure the closure of most of the federal government represents. Some members of the House of Representatives apparently believe their steadfast opposition to the Affordable Care law justifies the use of coercive threats: to defund U.S. government and harm the economy. In seeking to trump a lawful vote of both houses of Congress, a Supreme Court ruling and a reaffirming national presidential election, they tread on extremist ground. Their hubris is radical and nothing in modern American history provides a fair counterpart. To be sure, each major expansion of the U.S. federal government's role in ensuring Social Security, access to health care, and equal civil rights has been accompanied by intense ideological and partisan conflicts. But when milestone laws have survived the gantlet of Congress, been affirmed in a presidential signing ceremony, and withstood Supreme Court review, the losing party or faction has generally settled for taking arguments about repeal or revisions to the voters. They have also, to be sure, continued efforts to chip away at enforcement or funding through normal legislative steps. Republicans pushed back at parts of the Social Security Act of 1935 for more than 15 years, for example, but they never threatened to close down the entire federal government unless Democrats agreed to undo their own crowning New Deal legislative achievement. Republicans also continued to try to amend the Wagner Labor Relations Act until their partial success in the Taft-Hartley legislation of 1947; but the Wagner Act itself was never a subject of extortive efforts to defund the whole government. Since 1976, policy fights have at times shut down the federal government. Congressional disputes over federal funding of abortion led to several funding gaps during the Carter administration. Clashes over government spending, program cuts and other policy issues, including funding of the Nicaraguan Contras, led to similar results in the Reagan administration. In December 1995, the Clinton administration experienced the longest shutdown in modern American history when House Republicans attempted to extract a balanced budget from the president -- and failed as public opinion turned against the GOP. But in none of these episodes did a minority attempt to undo a major law by the sorts of threats against democratic decisions we see today. Some might argue that the actions of Republican House members are justified by the sweeping changes Affordable Care promises to bring. This law does seek to fulfill a century-long dream of reformers to ensure access to affordable health insurance to virtually all U.S. citizens. But the core provisions are far from radical. Devised by the conservative Heritage Foundation and first tested in Massachusetts under Republican Gov. Mitt Romney, the central tenets of Affordable Care respect and build upon private market mechanisms and long-established public programs like Medicaid for the poor and disabled. No, the extremism of the present moment should not be understood as a fair response to a governmental expansion some consider too vast. Unprecedented efforts to try to repeal or gut a major law by threatening the nation's government and economy are a symptom of a political party that has allowed a faction to pull it far away from fundamental democratic values. We can only hope that saner heads and hearts will soon prevail. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers.","Writers: Never in modern U.S. history has a political minority tried to undo a law with such radicalism .

"Sendai, Japan (CNN) -- In a nation already besieged with grief over mounting casualties, fears of possible radiation and the threat of more earthquakes, the nightmare grew for Japanese residents Monday as thousands of bodies reportedly surfaced and a government official confirmed another explosion at a nuclear reactor building. The official death toll from the epic quake and devastating tsunami that hit Japan four days ago reached 1,720 on Monday. But the numbers did not take into account the 2,000 bodies that Japan's Kyodo news agency said had been found in the hard-hit Miyagi Prefecture on Japan's northeast coast. Meanwhile, fresh white smoke rose again Monday from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, caused by an explosion at a building tied to the facility's No. 3 reactor. A similar explosion occurred two days earlier at the plant's No. 1 reactor building. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said Monday that the head of the nuclear plant reported the container vessel surrounding the No. 3 reactor remained intact. Yukio said in a news conference that there is little possibility that radioactive material was released into the air, NHK said. The explosion was likely caused by a combination of oxygen and hydrogen igniting, according to Japanese public broadcaster NHK. ""We are now collecting information on the concentration of radiation,"" Edano said. The quake and tsunami disabled the coolant systems at Fukushima Daiichi, which is about 260 km (160 miles) north of Tokyo. Japanese authorities have said there is a ""possibility"" that a meltdown has occurred in the damaged reactors, but said that there were no indications of dangerously high radiation levels in the atmosphere. Still, the government has evacuated more than 200,000 residents from homes close to the plant and tested 160 people for radiation exposure on Sunday, authorities said. Workers flooded two of the six reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi plant in a last-ditch attempt to head off a catastrophic meltdown of the reactor cores. In Miyagi Prefecture, rescue workers sifted through mountains of debris as hope for survivors appeared to dim. The town of Minami Sanriku -- about 5 kilometers from the Pacific Ocean -- morphed into a massive pile of wood that used to house some 20,000 residents. An eerie silence fell across town as emergency rescue officials said they don't think anyone was still alive under the rubble. About half of Minami Sanriku's population was unaccounted for. So far, about 15,000 people have been rescued, the Kyodo News Agency reported Monday, citing Kan. Japanese troops went door-to-door in the city of Ishinomaki, hoping to find survivors -- but found mostly the bodies of elderly residents. In the area of Sendai, where houses and buildings disintegrated into rushing water within seconds, solemn reisdents waited in lines that stretches blocks ore kilometers for food, water and gas. Despite the devastation surrounding them, the crowds appeared calm and orderly. But more destruction could still come. There's a high chance of a magnitude-7.0 quake or above in the next three days because of increased tectonic activity, the earthquake prediction department chief for the Japan Meteorological Agency said Sunday. The U.S. Geological Survey reported scores of such aftershocks. More than two dozen were greater than magnitude 6, the size of the quake that severely damaged Christchurch, New Zealand last month, the agency said. On Sunday, the country's prime minister called on people to pull together and face sacrifices. ""In the 65 years after the end of World War II, this is the toughest and the most difficult crisis for Japan,"" Prime Minister Naoto Kan told reporters at a televised news conference. ""We Japanese had a lot of difficulties in the past, but we were able to overcome those difficulties to reach this peaceful and prosperous society we have been able to build,"" Kan said. ""So with regard to the earthquake and tsunami, I am confident that the Japanese people can be united to work together."" The cooperation Kan called for will include accepting rolling blackouts in some areas to preserve electricity as emergency workers try to repair power plants damaged by the quake. About 2.5 million households, just over 4% of the total in Japan, were without electricity Sunday, said Ichiro Fujisaki, the nation's U.S. ambassador. Landmarks such as Tokyo Tower and the capital's Rainbow Bridge went dark in an effort to conserve energy. Japanese officials raised the quake's magnitude to 9.0 on Sunday, but the USGS kept its magnitude at 8.9. At least 48 other countries and the European Union have offered relief. The nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan arrived off Japan's coast Sunday to support Japanese forces in disaster relief operations, the U.S. Department of Defense said in a statement. Friday's quake is the strongest in recorded history to hit Japan, according to USGS records that date to 1900. The world's largest recorded quake took place in Chile on May 22, 1960, with a magnitude of 9.5, the agency said. CNN's Gary Tuchman, Anna Coren, Kyung Lah, Paula Hancocks, Brian Walker, Kevin Voigt and Sean Morris contributed to this report.","Official: There is little possibility that radioactive material was released in the air .

"Manchester, New Hampshire (CNN) -- Seven Republicans will be on the stage Monday night at the CNN/WMUR/New Hampshire Union Leader presidential debate, but one candidate will likely be the center of attention. Thanks to his standing at the top of the most recent horse race polls, his fundraising prowess and his top-flight campaign organization, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney is generally considered the front-runner at this early point in the battle for the GOP nomination. According to a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Monday morning, Romney -- who's making his second White House bid -- grabbed the support of 24% of Republicans and independents who lean toward the GOP. Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin is second with 20%, followed by former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and the rest of the field. But Romney's standing skyrockets to 35% -- 19 points ahead of the rest of the field -- when Palin and Giuliani, both of whom are still on the fence about the race, are taken out of the mix. Poll: Romney at top of GOP field . Because of his front-runner status and nagging questions among conservatives about the health care law he instituted in Massachusetts, expect Romney to have a bull's-eye on his back tonight in the early primary state he needs to win if he hopes to be the nominee. Here's what to watch for: . Pawlenty's target: Romneycare . For months, former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty has shied away from direct attacks on Romney but that's about to change. Pawlenty signaled over the weekend that he intends to step up his criticism of Romney in hopes of making inroads with fiscal conservatives who might be uncomfortable with the former Massachusetts governor. The mild-mannered Pawlenty needs to start drawing the contrast: Despite hiring a blue-chip staff and spending significant time in the first-to-vote states of Iowa and New Hampshire, he remains a single-digit blip in most state and national polls. So Pawlenty took sharp aim at Romney during a Fox News appearance Sunday, tying President Barack Obama's health care law to Romney's health care legislation in Massachusetts. ""The president's own words is that he patterned in large measure 'Obamacare' after what happened in Massachusetts,"" Pawlenty said. ""What I don't understand is they both continue to defend it."" Pawlenty lumped both laws together with the invention of a new term: ""Obamneycare."" He repeated the criticism later Sunday at a campaign stop in New Hampshire. Expect to hear more health care talk from Pawlenty during Monday's debate. The Gingrich relaunch . Romney will be the center of attention on Monday night, but former House Speaker Newt Gingrich might have the most to prove. Gingrich's entire senior staff abandoned his campaign last week, citing the candidate's questionable work ethic and fundraising ability. And yet, Gingrich has vowed to march on with his bid; he now has to prove that he can effectively run campaign the way he wants. Strong performances in nationally televised debates were always key to Gingrich's White House hopes. But in the wake of last week's campaign implosion, he must use Monday's forum not just to show off his presidential timbre. He has to demonstrate that his candidacy is still viable. Ready for Ron? Longtime Texas congressman Ron Paul is making his third bid for the White House. Paul has devoted and energetic followers, but he is thought to be somewhat out of the mainstream of GOP politics thanks to his calls to scale back U.S. military efforts abroad and his crusade to get rid of the Federal Reserve. But in the aftermath of the 2010 midterms, which saw Republicans make gains up and down the ballot after running campaigns built on scaling back the size of government, Paul insists that Republicans are moving toward his proposals. He pressed that message while on the campaign trail in New Hampshire on Friday. ""Some people say, 'Why don't you make your message more mainstream?' "" he said. ""Well, my message is becoming more mainstream."" Paul will try to make that case to a national audience tonight. Bachmann's debut . U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota has yet to form an exploratory committee, but all signs point to a Republican presidential bid. She is expected to launch a campaign in Waterloo, Iowa -- the town in which she was born -- in the coming weeks. She has lined up veteran Republican strategists Ed Rollins and pollster Ed Goeas to help run her political operation. And Bachmann has already proved that she can stir the passions of conservative voters in a way that others in the Republican field cannot. Bachmann is already a national figure thanks to her frequent cable news appearances and unabashed criticism of Obama. But establishment Republicans have questioned whether a three-term member of Congress with a meager legislative record and a tendency for over-the-top rhetoric can go toe-to-toe with some of the political veterans seeking the GOP nomination (not to mention the president of the United States). Her supporters beg to differ. Conservative audiences in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina have been impressed by her policy-heavy criticisms of Obama. She will have a chance to demonstrate her seriousness on Monday. Hi, my name is Rick Santorum . Rick Santorum may be among the least-known of the seven people on the stage. But thanks to his staunch opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage, the former two-term senator from Pennsylvania is popular with social conservatives who have played an influential role in choosing the GOP nominee. Santorum often touts his social conservative credentials. Last week, he told CNN Chief National Correspondent John King, who will moderate the debate, ""I talk the talk and I walk the walk, and I think that's what people are looking for, an authentic conviction conservative."" Though he has spent more time in the key early caucus and primary states than any of his rivals, Santorum remains in the low single digits in just about every national Republican horse race poll. The Monday debate could give Santorum an opportunity to increase his name identification by introducing himself to the country. Santorum also has a more robust foreign policy record than any of the declared Republicans candidates thanks to his time in the Senate, something he might try to highlight on Monday. Rising Cain . Herman Cain remains something of a curiosity to most voters, and Republican insiders largely discount his viability as a national candidate. But the former Godfather's Pizza CEO has started to gain traction among social conservatives and Tea Party activists in Iowa who are expected to have a major voice in the state's leadoff presidential caucuses. Cain has also made frequent appearances in New Hampshire and he delivered a strong performance last month at a Republican debate in South Carolina, albeit one that lacked Romney and featured just five candidates. Debates always give lesser-known candidates a chance to shine. With a knack for clever one-liners and confrontational barbs, he just might charm some Republicans getting their first look at the Republican field. Jon who? Jon Huntsman, the former governor of Utah who resigned to serve as Obama's ambassador to China, plans to make New Hampshire a lynchpin of his campaign. Despite spending loads of time in the Granite State over the past month, Huntsman decided to take a pass on the debate, saying that he is not yet an official candidate and still putting the finishing touches on his potential campaign. But Romney and Pawlenty both view Huntsman, with his executive resume and deep pockets, as a serious foe. It's worth watching to see if any of the candidates jab at the absentee candidate over his service in the Obama administration or his decision to skip the debate.","Expect front-runner Mitt Romney to be the target of his rivals .

"(CNN) -- The primary joy of a bicycle is that, in its purest form, it's little more than a highly efficient way of walking. Just grab the bike, climb aboard and pedal swiftly to the shop, the bar or wherever. Some cyclists, however, prefer their rides a bit more dramatic. Perhaps even scenic, remote and arduous. Here's a selection of fantastic rides from around the world that take anything from a day to several months to complete. Don't forget the anti-chafe cream. The Friendship Highway (China) Whether or not the 800 kilometers (500 miles) between the Tibetan city of Lhasa and the Nepalese border is the planet's most beautiful ride depends on your idea enjoyment of sometimes bleak high-altitude vistas. What's in little doubt is that it's the highest. The route includes three road passes of more than 5,000 meters (16,400 feet), with a lung-bursting maximum of 5,220 meters over the Gyatso La mountain pass, where the reward on a clear day is a distant view of Everest. This, it goes without saying, isn't for everyone. Conditions can be testing and the distance between towns necessitates careful planning. Plus, the sensitive political situation in Tibet means individual travel can be tricky at times. For the sufficiently committed this remains one of the globe's true adventures, from the religious and cultural wonders of Lhasa and Gyantse to the prayer flag-draped peak of the Gampa La mountain pass, with the vast, turquoise lake, Yamdrok Yumtso, shining in the valley below. If that's not enough, the route ends with possibly the world's longest descent, a precipitous 3,500-meter drop off the edge of the Tibetan plateau along muddy hairpins. La Ruta de los Conquistadores (Costa Rica) Shorter but arguably no less arduous than the Friendship Highway is this 270-kilometer off-road ride across Costa Rica. From the Pacific to Caribbean coasts, this one takes in mud paths, rainforest, coffee plantations, even an extinct volcano. It can be completed in three days each November as part of the annual mountain bike race from which the ride takes its name. Those in less of a rush can spend as long as they like, whenever they like, tracing the route of the 16th-century Spanish conqueror Juan de Cavallon, the chief conquistador of the title. Costa Rica has a vast range of natural wonder packed into an area roughly the size of Switzerland, around a quarter of it national park -- La Ruta delivers a decent taste of this. Beginning in the surf resort of Jaco Beach, the route soon turns onto energy-sapping red mud dirt roads, climbing up. And up and up -- the official La Ruta course includes about 3,000 meters (9,842 feet) of climbing on the first day alone. Skirting the capital, San Jose, it passes near the extinct peak volcanic peak of Irazu and down again to mangrove forests and white sand beaches. The traditional end to the trip is a dip in the Caribbean. Riding in is optional. North Sea Cycle Route (Europe) The NSCR, which also goes by the slightly less evocative name of Euro Velo Route 12, is a Euroskeptic's nightmare -- an EU-funded epic across eight countries that claims to be the longest signposted cycle route in the world. Covering almost 6,000 kilometers (3,728 miles), it runs from the northern edge of Scotland's Shetland Islands along the coasts of Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Norway. It hopefully goes without saying that there's no need for anyone to attempt the whole thing. Inevitably, it also goes without saying that a surprising number of people do, mainly over a series of summers -- this is a route where the warmest spot is probably somewhere near Ostend on the coast of Belgium, so it's really not one for winter. The more intrepid riders fill the official NSCR website with arcane tips about acquiring krone when crossing into Denmark and the best way to get themselves and their bikes over the sea crossings. The Shimanami Kaido (Japan) At a shade more than 64 kilometers (40 miles) this is perhaps the only route on this list on which riders could reasonably consider taking their kids the full length without worrying about a visit from social services. Completely separated from the road, it snakes across a series of small, wonderfully scenic islands in Hiroshima prefecture, in the west of the country. Japan might be more popularly associated with the car rather than the bike, but cycling is common here and the Shimanami Kaido shows how two and four wheels can happily coexist. The segregated cycleway, which also has a lane for pedestrians, for the most part runs alongside the road, though there are diversions, not least the longer, more gentle and thus more leg-friendly slopes up to the high road bridges. Bikes can be hired at a series of points along the path. Some people complete the trip in a day, but many dawdle to gaze at the beautiful vistas along the Seto Inland Sea. This is a route for gentle meandering, not teeth-gritted grinding. Yes, there are tolls on the bridges for cyclists, but these are pretty small, more necessitating a pocket of change than a bank loan. Great Divide Mountain Bike Route (North America) Want big? This is big. An off-road touring route from Canada's Alberta all the way to New Mexico. If the 4,400-kilometer (2,734 miles) length (as detailed on the Adventure Cycling website) isn't enough to start palpitations, how about a combined 61,000 meters (you don't even want to know what that is in feet) of climbing? Yes, that's right, almost seven times the height of Everest -- from sea level, that is, not base camp. It's also often extremely remote, and thus largely the preserve of wiry, wind-burnished men and women on much-traveled mountain bikes towing trailers filled with anti-bear spray, titanium camping spoons and nuclear fusion nano-stoves. It's undeniably spectacular, taking in everything from woodland to mountains (did we forget to mention the Colorado Rockies?) and the wastelands of the Great Basin. Potential companions could include grizzlies, moose, mountain lions and eagles. If that's not enough to think about, weather conditions mean the trip is only really feasible from June to September, and even then flash rains can make sections impassably muddy for weeks at a time. Munda Biddi Trail (Australia) Another epic, and this time in one of the more cutoff places in the world: Western Australia. At least with the Munda Biddi the route organizers might actually be on the rider's side. Slightly. A vastly ambitious, recently completed 960-plus kilometer (596 miles) off-road route through the forested wilderness -- Munda Biddi means ""path through the forest"" in the local indigenous language -- it runs from near the state capital, Perth, to Albany in the far southwest. The less ambitious can tackle smaller, less strenuous sections of just a day or more, and the official website gives updates on sometimes muddy trail conditions. Anyone planning the full slog would be wise to avoid the full heat of summer, and come prepared. That said, between towns there are designated campsites every 30 or so miles, with sleeping huts and water supplies. The South Downs Way (England) File under ""deceptively tricky."" This 160-kilometer route (99 miles) is hardly alpine in outlook, crossing some of the most stereotypically lush and rolling English countryside you can imagine. But all those small ups and down add up. Riders tackling the entire route commit themselves to almost 4,300 meters (14,107 feet) of uphill pedaling. A much tramped walking route for thousands of years and now a fully signposted hiking trail, the South Downs Way meanders from the precipitous cliffs of Beachy Head to historic Winchester, virtually all off road and much of it on ancient chalky bridleways. Open to cyclists, walkers and horse riders, those on two wheels generally allow two or three days for the trip, and there are plenty of absurdly picturesque villages en route with pubs and guesthouses. Some hardy souls tackle the entire thing in a day, but there's an argument that pedaling furiously through some of England's most glorious vistas kind of misses the point.

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- Two Philadelphia firefighters died early Monday and three others were injured after a wall collapsed in a building that had been cited repeatedly for safety violations and was set to be sold at auction later this year, officials said. The collapse occurred about 5:50 a.m. as the five were inside a furniture store, said Deputy Fire Commissioner Ernest Hargett Jr. Four of the firefighters were trapped inside, he said, but the fifth was able to get free. Firefighters were forced to move brick and timber by hand and cut through some materials to rescue the others, Hargett said. The initial report of the blaze came in at 3:13 a.m., Hargett said. Responding firefighters issued four additional alarms as the flames burned out of control for two hours and embers set surrounding buildings ablaze. The furniture store was one of the surrounding buildings, he said, and the five were ""investigating an extension of fire"" inside when the collapse occurred. In a press conference later Monday, Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Everett Gillison said city officials received complaints last November about the conditions in the main property involved in the blaze. Inspectors visited the building six days later, found problems and cited the property's owner. When they went back in December and found nothing had been done, they issued another citation -- with an identical scenario of inaction followed by a citation playing out 30 days later. The city pushed to bring the owners to court after the third citation, Gillison said, with a court date likely due sometime in May. Meanwhile, the building's owner had failed to pay $60,000 in taxes and another $12,000 in water fees, the deputy mayor said. After citations, fines and a court order, the building was being scheduled for a ""sheriff's sale"" -- a public auction for back taxes -- likely in June or July, said Gillison. ""We were not going to drop the ball on this one, and we did not,"" he said, saying that city officials were responsive all along to residents' complaints about the property. At Mayor Michael Nutter's urging, the city plans to contact District Attorney Seth Williams to determine if the owner's failure to maintain the building was ""risking a catastrophe and whether this amounts to criminal negligence,"" according to Gillison. Richard Negrin, the city's managing director, said investigators will determine if the fire was caused by arson or negligence. He stressed the duty of building owners, in this case and others, to abide by city code to ensure their properties are safe and secure. ""It is first and foremost the responsibility of the building owner to be in compliance with the code,"" Negrin said. The firefighters who died in Monday's blaze were 60-year-old Robert Neary and 25-year-old Daniel Sweeney, the firefighter's union and Fire Commissioner Lloyd Ayers said. ""We have a veteran firefighter and we have a new firefighter,"" Ayers told reporters. The IAFF Local 22 union identified two firefighters ""seriously injured"" in the incident as Patrick Nally, who is in critical but stable condition, and Francis Chaney, who is in stable condition. ""Right now, we're asking for prayers for the families,"" Ayers said. ""We're asking for everybody to be supportive. We're asking that you respect the firefighters, their families, their lives."" The last time multiple Philadelphia firefighters died in the line of duty was 2004, Ayers said, and the last firefighter death was in 2006. ""This is absolutely a tragedy,"" the commissioner said. ""No one wants to lose anyone.""","NEW: The building failed inspections and its owner didn't pay taxes, a city official says .

"(CNN) -- It might not make up for losing the Wimbledon final but in his first meeting with Andy Murray since last July, Novak Djokovic got a slice of revenge. The Serbian world No. 2 elbowed defending champion Murray out of the Miami Masters, but not without a spot of controversy. Djokovic sealed a 7-5 6-3 victory with some trademark tennis but was given a helping hand by a debatable call towards the end of the first set. Although the umpire allowed Djokovic's winner to stand, replays appeared to show the 26-year-old had reached over the net to play what proved a decisive volley. Read more: Venus Williams has 'nothing to lose' Murray questioned the call, speaking to both his opponent and the official before play continued, and Djokovic wrapped up the opening set 7-5. The Briton defeated Djokovic in straight sets on his way to a second grand slam title at Wimbledon in 2013 and the Serbian repeated the feat in front of a sunkissed Miami crowd. Although Murray earned a break to lead 3-2 in the second, Djokovic roared back to win the next four games and wrap up the match in 90 minutes. Murray, who recently parted company with coach Ivan Lendl, showed signs of getting back to his best after a spell on the sidelines with a back injury. As for Djokovic, he will face Japan's Kei Nishikori in the semifinals as he bids to win his second title of 2014, hot on the heels of his triumph at Indian Wells. Nishikori upset Indian Wells finalist Roger Federer, coming from behind to triumph 3-6 7-5 6-4 against the two-time Miami champion. In the women's draw, Dominika Cibulkova booked a likely place in the top-10 in the world rankings with a hard-fought 3-6 7-6 6-3 victory over Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska. Cibulkova, from Slovakia, battled for two-and-a-half hours before finally sealing a semifinals clash with China's world No. 2 Li Na -- who beat former top-ranked Dane Caroline Wozniacki 7-5 7-5. It will be a replay of January's Australian Open final, which Li won. ""This win really means a lot to me,"" Cibulkova said during an on-court interview after a win which should see her make a first ever appearance in the world's top 10 on Monday. ""It's always tough to play Aga, but I knew I just had to stay aggressive. If you make some mistakes with Aga you still have to stay aggressive. ""That's the way I play, and it's the only way to beat her. I just had to keep going."" ""I knew before the match that this was the match I needed to win to become top 10,"" she added. ""So it was some more pressure, but I'm obviously very happy with the way I handled it today.""

"Washington (CNN) -- A U.S. Navy drone crashed Monday in a marsh near Salisbury, Maryland. The RQ-4A Global Hawk drone crashed during a routine training flight from Naval Air Station Patuxent River, according to Jamie Cosgrove, a spokeswoman for the Unmanned Aviation and Strike Weapons Program at the base. There were no injuries to civilians and no property damage, said the Navy, which said it is investigating the cause. Video from CNN affiliate WBOC showed smoke rising from brush fires in the unpopulated area. The drone crashed into a tributary of the Nanticoke River, a U.S. Coast Guard official said. The crash site has been blocked to recreational boat traffic while the agency investigates, the Coast Guard official said. As soon as Navy personnel lost contact with the unmanned vehicle, a piloted aircraft was dispatched to Maryland's Eastern Shore, where it came upon the wreckage and determined that it was unlikely anyone on the ground had been hurt, Navy officials told CNN. The crash occurred at about 12:11 p.m., near Bloodworth Island in Dorchester County, the Navy said. The aircraft is one of five aircraft acquired from the Air Force Global Hawk program. The BAMS-D program has been developing tactics and doctrine for the employment of high-altitude unmanned patrol aircraft since November 2006. The drone can fly for 30 hours without refueling at altitudes as high as 11 miles. It is typically used for reconnaissance. Of the five drones based at southern Maryland's Naval Air Station Patuxent River, four are in routine training and one is deployed with the U.S. Navy Fifth Fleet, the officials said. The basic RQ-4A Global Hawk UAV, manufactured for the U.S. Air Force by Northrop-Grumman, is the largest and most advanced drone in the U.S. military, according to the Navy. It is 44 feet long, has a 116-foot wingspan and weighs 25,600 lbs. The vehicles cost $176 million apiece, the Government Accountability Office reported in 2010. Crashes are highly unusual, Navy officials said.","NEW: No one was hurt and no property was damaged, the Navy says .

"Angola, Louisiana (CNN) -- Prisoners in southeastern Louisiana are helping to fill sandbags and patch up levee holes along the swollen Mississippi in an all-hands-on-deck effort to keep the mighty river at bay. At the Louisiana State Penitentiary, also known as Angola, parts of the sprawling prison complex are already underwater. An outer-ring levee was breached and some 2,000 inmates have been evacuated. But an estimated 2,500 inmates are still at the prison, working to fill holes and keep the grounds dry. The 18,000-acre facility has a secondary levee that is currently holding the bulk of the water back. The prison is bordered on three sides by the Mississippi River. ""This is 18,000 acres -- this is as large as Manhattan,"" said Burl Cain, the warden at Angola. ""Think about evacuating Manhattan -- boom!"" Elsewhere in Louisiana, inmates in Pointe Coupee Parish have filled more than 110,000 sandbags, some of which were expected to be sent to St. Landry Parish, said CNN affiliate WBRZ. Others were used to shore up levees. ""The inmates take a lot of pride in doing this. They've been working very hard,"" said Point Coupee Sheriff Bud Torres, the station reported. Like many states, Louisiana is struggling to cope with the worst flood to hit the lower Mississippi River valley since at least 1937. Severe storms swept across the Midwest Sunday, bringing with them the threat of even more rain. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal has asked for federal assistance in grappling with flooding stemming from the Morganza Spillway, where 17 bays have been opened in hopes of sparing New Orleans farther downstream. So far, the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development has delivered nearly 150,000 sandbags, 30,000 cubic yards of sand and 33,000 linear feet of fabric-lined baskets, the governor's office said. Approximately 1,150 Louisiana National Guard members have been mobilized. Mandatory evacuations were in effect Saturday in Happy Town and the Sherburne Wildlife Management Area, the St. Martin Parish Sheriff's Office said. Evacuations in Butte La Rose have been ordered to start on Tuesday. Spillway gates are likely to be open for weeks, meaning it will be some time before the river falls below flood stage, allowing evacuees to return. In just the St. Landry and St. Martin parishes alone, more than 3,000 people have evacuated, the governor's office said last week. But so far, the prisoners left at Angola are holding their ground. ""There's a lot of worse places you can be,"" said inmate Darren Jarvis in response to a question about how he felt about working to save the institution that imprisons him. ""I would hate to see what it would be like if I had to go somewhere else.""","Parts of the Louisiana State Penitentiary are already underwater .

"(CNN) -- A nearly five-hour manhunt across Seattle ended Wednesday afternoon when the suspect in a pair of fatal shootings turned a gun on himself as police closed in, investigators said. Detectives believe the man was behind both the triple slaying at a coffeehouse in the city's University District and the fatal shooting of a woman near downtown about a half-hour later, Assistant Police Chief Jim Pugel told reporters. The suspect shot himself in the head but was still alive Wednesday evening, police said. Two men were found dead at the coffeehouse, and a woman wounded in the shooting spree died in a hospital later. Two other men were listed in critical condition Wednesday afternoon. The second shooting left one woman dead in what police described as a possible carjacking about four miles away. Detectives ""feel very confident that unfortunately, these are all connected, but fortunately we have the person in custody,"" Pugel said. He said a plainclothes detective spotted the suspect in southwest Seattle, within two miles of where the sport-utility vehicle seen fleeing the second shooting had been ditched. The detective called in uniformed officers, and the man shot himself as they approached, Pugel said. Barely an hour earlier, police had released security-camera images of the yet-unidentified suspect at CafÃ© Racer, in the city's University District. Heavily armed police were used dogs to search the neighborhood around the cafe for much of Wednesday afternoon, neighbors said. ""The streets are blocked off, and there's tons of cops,"" said Joe Backus, the manager of a musical instrument shop next to CafÃ© Racer. Police told employees and customers to stay inside while the search was going on, he said. Nearby resident Evan Hill said he could hear the gunfire from his living room. ""I counted four or five shots and somebody shouting, and I ran out to my balcony and called 911,"" Hill told CNN affiliate KOMO. Hill called the cafe a ""very mellow"" venue that hosts artwork and musical performances. ""It makes you kind of angry that it would happen in a place like that,"" he said. Witnesses to the second shooting told police a woman and man were arguing in a parking lot when the man pulled out a pistol and shot the woman in the head. He took off in a black Mercedes sport-utility vehicle, which was found around noon in a neighborhood a few miles southwest of downtown with a pistol inside, Pugel said. Seattle, a city of about 600,000, recorded 20 homicides in 2011, according to Police Department statistics. Wednesday's rampage brings 2012's year-to-date total to 19. But Mayor Mike McGinn said there have been ""multiple tragic episodes of gun violence"" around the city in recent weeks. In an afternoon news conference with police, during which news of the suspect's shooting emerged, McGinn said ending that violence was ""the highest priority."" ""We will be working with our police to give them the tools they need to focus on violent offenders with access to guns,"" he said. ""But it's also going to take a focus on the laws that make it too easy for people to acquire guns. And it's going to also take a full partnership with the community to end a culture of violence where young men believe it's OK to attempt to resolve disputes with violence, including guns.""","Seattle police link coffeehouse, downtown-area shootings .

"Warsaw (CNN) -- President Barack Obama wants Vladimir Putin to take steps to rebuild the trust shattered by Russia's actions in Ukraine. Obama's comment came as he visited Poland on Tuesday, the first stop on his three-country European trip which is intended, in part, to reassure allies in Eastern Europe unnerved by Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region. Putin ""has a choice to make"" on Ukraine, Obama said during a news conference in Warsaw, calling on the Russian President to continue to pull back troops from the border with Ukraine, persuade pro-Russian separatists to stand down and back Ukraine's recent presidential election. If the United States sees ""responsible behavior"" from Russia, Obama said, ""I think it is possible for us to try to rebuild some of the trust that has been shattered."" But he warned that it will take ""quite some time."" Kiev and the West have said the separatists in Ukraine are coordinated and supplied by Russia, a claim that Moscow denies. Obama's visit comes a day after a deadly attack on a regional headquarters building in Donetsk that has been taken over by separatists calling themselves the People's Republic of Luhansk. Five women and three men, all of them civilians, were killed in the attack, which Kiev has blamed on separatists. A munitions expert who accompanied a CNN crew to the scene, however, said the damage to the building was indicative of an airstrike. Social media video shows an aircraft overhead after the attacks, trees are splintered as if they were hit from above and craters in a nearby square leading to the building appear to have been the result of heavy cannon fire from the air. A meeting in France? Obama, speaking alongside Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski, said he had always had a ""business-like relationship"" with Putin and that he had conveyed the same messages to him in private conversations as were made in public. He said Washington wanted good relations, but added that sanctions imposed over Russia's Crimea excursion would be maintained and that more have been drawn up in case of further destabilization in the east. Obama added that he was ""sure"" he would cross paths with Putin while both are in France at the end of the week for events to mark the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Obama said he was looking forward to meeting with Ukraine's President-elect Petro Poroshenko on Wednesday, adding that his election last month ""gives us some momentum to build on as we move forward."" He also stressed the need for Ukraine to pursue economic as well as political reform, including taking steps to reduce its reliance on natural gas from Russia. At the same news conference, Obama announced that he is asking Congress for a fund of up to $1 billion to allow for a ""European Reassurance Initiative"" to bolster the security of NATO allies. This would help the United States undertake increased training exercises, explore the pre-positioning of military equipment, and build the capacity of Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine to partner with the United States and NATO. More U.S. Air Force and Army personnel will be rotated through allied countries in central and eastern Europe, Obama said. He urged all NATO nations to live up to their commitment to the alliance when member states are threatened, and commended Poland for its contribution. Bergdahl questions . As he undertakes his third overseas trip in less than three months, Obama finds himself once again peppered with questions about his foreign policy, even as he attempts to cement his own legacy on the world stage. His latest trip comes as Republicans have unleashed a new line of attack questioning his judgment in exchanging five Taliban prisoners held at the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for the return of a former prisoner of war, Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. Obama defended the decision, saying, ""We don't leave men and women in uniform behind."" His administration had previously consulted with Congress on the possibility of a prisoner exchange for Bergdahl, Obama said, but said it had to move quickly because of concerns over Bergdahl's health and to not miss a window of opportunity. He said he was confident the exchange of Taliban prisoners for Bergdahl would not endanger U.S. national security because the Qataris, who helped broker the deal, would be keeping a close eye on the ex-Guantanamo detainees. Walesa: Superpower not 'up to the job' For Obama, the itinerary of foreign travel has changed, but the conversation will sound familiar. During his last two foreign trips, he fielded questions about his approach to the crises in Ukraine and Syria, as well as the territorial disputes in Asia between China and its neighbors. In Manila, Obama responded that his second-term strategy is to avoid ""errors."" But away from the cameras, he has simplified his doctrine as ""don't do stupid stuff,"" administration officials say privately. However, Obama's critics, both at home and abroad, contend that approach is at best uninspiring, and potentially dangerous. Lech Walesa, the former Polish President whose democratic Solidarity movement helped usher in freedom in Poland during the fall of the Soviet Union, has warned that U.S. influence has declined under Obama's watch. ""The superpower has not been up to the job,"" Walesa said in a recent interview with the TVN24 television network. ""Therefore, the world is at a dangerous point and maybe it really is the case that lots of bad things are happening in the world because there is no leadership,"" added Walesa, who endorsed Obama's rival, Mitt Romney, in the 2012 presidential election. Obama has billed his recent decisions against any form of military action in Syria and Ukraine as successes because they rallied multilateral responses to global challenges, without messy prolonged commitments for U.S. armed forces. Obama, Putin cross paths . In France, Obama will have several opportunities to cross paths with Putin. They are both scheduled to dine with French President Francois Hollande on Thursday in Paris, though in separate meetings. The German government's press office confirmed Tuesday that German Chancellor Angela Merkel will speak with Putin on Friday in Normandy, when the two will discuss the situation in Ukraine. The talks on the sidelines of the D-Day commemorations will continue a telephone conversation the two leaders held Tuesday and focus on measures to aid the stabilization of Ukraine, it said. Obama led the international effort to suspend Russia's participation in the world group of economic powers. That suspension resulted in the relocation of this year's G7 summit from Sochi, Russia, to Brussels, which will occur during Obama's trip. Recent moves by Russia to withdraw some of its forces from its border with Ukraine has the potential to ease tensions between Moscow and Washington. But administration officials caution a new detente is a long way off. CNN's Jim Acosta wrote and reported from Warsaw, Laura Smith-Spark from London and Diana Magnay from Donetsk. CNN's Laura Bernardini, Chloe Sommers, Stephanie Halasz and Jason Hanna contributed to this report.","NEW: Expert says attack in Donetsk indicative of airstrike, not rebels .

"(CNN) -- They finally called a spade a spade. Japanese Parliament's new report on the Fukushima nuclear crisis stated that the ""fundamental causes are to be found in the ingrained conventions of Japanese culture: our reflexive obedience; our reluctance to question authority; our devotion to sticking with the program."" This admission exposes perhaps the weakest aspect of the Japanese governance style. Japanese companies are known to be indecisive, always taking a long time to reach any conclusion. On the other hand, they make the world's best consumer products. How can one explain this paradox? In the aftermath of the big earthquake last year, there was a group of 40 Japanese stranded in a building. There was no food in a freezing cold night, except for one cup of instant noodle. The 40 people calmly shared that one little cup, without any fight or quarrel. Stories like this coming out of the affected region illustrate the amazing level of collective discipline that Japanese have. It's hard to imagine the same behavior anywhere else. For the Japanese, this wasn't unusual. The reactions to such stories in Japan were along the line of: ""We knew you'd hang in there, well done, we're right behind you."" The Japanese are educated from a very early age to constantly ""think about others"" and to assess ""the positing of one's self in an organizational context."" Hence, solidarity within a group setting is very important. The unwritten communal rituals, value sharing and group-binding rules are so strong that they can overrule laws. In such a culture, the leaders in Japan are often selected on a consensus basis. In other words, the leader is often the person who can best represent and voice the group's collective interests. Individualism and top-down decision-making process are often rejected, especially among traditional organizations like the government or corporations. As a result, someone who has original or different ideas is more likely to be cast out of a group. This is opposite of the top-down decision-making process that is required for the leaders in Western countries. This consensus-based management style leads to an internal ""village-like"" way of doing things, usually under a closed-door policy. It breeds vested interests, which binds the leaders tighter. It is not hard to imagine that such organizational traits can easily reject third party's comments or suggestions, even if they are objective. For example, when there was a whistleblower from TEPCO, the first call that the government made to TEPCO was: ""Hey, you have a whistle blower"" instead of ""Hey, you might have a problem at the nuclear reactor -- look into it."" This is when rationality is washed away by excessive formalities and bureaucratic rituals. Many Japanese scandals in the past have been the result of this type of behavior. When there is no crisis, or when there is little or no paradigm change, the Japanese decision-making process is not a problem. In fact, it can even be advantageous, especially in a corporate environment. Japanese workers are extremely obedient, hard-working and loyal to their group. The corporate chief simply pushes his ""automatic flight mode"" and the plane will glide nicely as the mass will work hard to set the course. However, when there is an unanticipated event like an earthquake or tsunami, Japanese leaders cannot cope well. This is equivalent to when they are asked to make a decision about crash landing. Since these leaders have been constantly opting for consensus decision-making process that is based on precedents, when there is no precedent they malfunction. Strong top-down leadership when needed is simply not there. The statement in the Fukushima report says it all -- there is both strength and weakness to the Japanese style of management. The challenge for the Japanese is to open up to individualism and more top-down leadership while retaining collectivism to some degree. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Seijiro Takeshita.","Fukushima report says nuclear crisis was a ""man-made disaster""

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. troops were among the casualties in the shooting rampage at the Colorado movie theater, including a sailor who was listed as unaccounted for, the Pentagon said Friday. The Defense Department released a statement that said one sailor was injured and another one, known to have been at the theater, was unaccounted for. Two airmen were wounded in the incident, it said. Buckley AFB in Aurora, Colorado, is the closest military base to the scene of the shootings. Spokesman Master Sgt. Jill Lavoie said some of the wounded were from Buckley. About 10,000 troops -- including members of the Air Force, Army and Marine Corps -- are stationed at Buckley. Soon after the shooting, the base initiated a head count, Lavoie said. One of the units on base is the 743rd Military Intelligence Battalion. A post Friday on its Facebook page said that the Traumatic Stress Response Team (Mental Health Support) and Emergency Family Assistance Control Center (EFACC) had been activated at the base chapel. ""If you or family members need assistance or counseling following the aftermath of the Aurora Movie Theater shooting, you can meet with the teams standing by to help you,"" the posting says.

"HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- In Hong Kong, where the alert level has been raised to ""emergency"" after reporting its first case of swine flu, authorities are trying to keep the H1N1 virus from spreading through the metropolis of 7 million people through quarantine, stepped-up border measures and surveillance. Quarantined guests and hotel employees wave through the glass of the main entrance of Hong Kong's Metro Park Hotel. The quarantine has extended beyond the single confirmed case, a 25-year-old Mexican man, to include more than 340 people. They include: two taxi drivers, two fellow taxi passengers, a local friend, 36 passengers within a three-row vicinity of the patient aboard a China Eastern flight from Shanghai to Hong Kong, and 300 guests and staff at the Metropark Hotel he checked into. All have been put on the antiviral drug, Tamiflu. Among the two cab drivers, one was suspected of taking the patient from the airport to the hotel, and another was believed to have taken him from the hotel to the hospital. Authorities are seeing another 40 to 50 guests whose names are on the hotel's guest list. Some of them left their luggage behind. ""They are gambling with their health, jeopardizing public health safety,"" said Dr. York Chow, secretary for Food and Health, appealing to the guests to come forward. In addition to the Metropark Hotel in Wanchai district, the Lady Maclehose Holiday Village is being used as an isolation center during the one-week quarantines. The government has assured that people under quarantine will have their visas automatically extended, their hotel lodging fees waived and their onward journeys prepared. The Wanchai hotel is providing guests $200 worth of free overseas telephone calls daily. The isolation order, which went into effect Friday night, is to expire Friday at 8:30 p.m. (8:30 a.m. ET) -- the length of an incubation period for swine flu. The isolation order did not extend to the air crew or remaining passengers aboard the China Eastern flight. An airplane's air exchange rate is high compared to that in an office or hotel, explained Yuen Kwok-yung, chair of infectious diseases at the University of Hong Kong. ""Risk is very low on a plane,"" he said. So far, there have been no further confirmed cases of swine flu, and no Hong Kong pigs have tested positive for the virus, Yuen said.","More than 340 people quarantined in Hong Kong following single case of H1N1 .

"(CNN) -- The former manager of the largest U.S. kosher meatpacking plant was arrested Thursday on federal conspiracy charges of harboring illegal immigrants and aiding and abetting aggravated identity theft, federal officials said. Agriprocessors, the nation's largest kosher meatpacking plant, is in Postville, Iowa. Sholom Rubashkin, 49, a powerful member of the Hasidic Jewish community and former head of the kosher plant Agriprocessors, was taken into custody Thursday morning by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. ""This investigation is not closed and is continuing,"" said Bob Teig, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Rubashkin was arrested in Postville, Iowa, a town of about 2,400 in the northeast corner of the state that is home to the kosher plant. He faces three counts: conspiracy to harbor illegal aliens for profit; aiding and abetting document fraud; and aiding and abetting aggravated identity theft. If convicted, the first two counts carry a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and fines of up to $250,000. The third count carries a mandatory consecutive sentence of two years, Teig said.  See photos around ""ground zero"" of the nation's immigration debate » . ICE spokesman Tim Counts said he could not comment about specifics. ""Things are still unfolding,"" he said. Calls to Agriprocessors seeking reaction have not been returned. Rubashkin made an initial court appearance Thursday afternoon, where he waived his right to a preliminary hearing. He was released on the following conditions: He must wear an ankle bracelet that tracks his movement, limit his travel to northern Iowa, surrender his passport and his wife's passport and provide a $1 million appearance bond with $500,000 to be secured by Wednesday, according to the prosecutor's office. ICE agents raided the Agriprocessors plant May 12 and arrested more than 300 illegal aliens, most of whom pleaded guilty to identity theft charges in trials that lasted less than two days. Rubashkin was the plant manager at the time of the raid. Read how the Postville raid angered a local priest . ""None of the undocumented alien workers were in possession of documents allowing them to work or reside in the United States legally,"" the affidavit against Rubashkin says. ""During the execution of the warrants, agents discovered and seized dozens of fraudulent permanent resident alien cards from offices within the human resources department at Agriprocessors."" Thursday's arrest came a day after a human resources manager pleaded guilty to conspiracy to harbor illegal immigrants and aggravated identity theft charges. Laura Louise Althouse, 38, faces a mandatory sentence of two years in prison and a potential maximum of 12 years in prison, according to the U.S. attorney's office. ""Althouse conspired with others to harbor undocumented aliens at her place of employment in Postville. The information states the harboring offense was committed for the purpose of commercial advantage and private financial gain,"" the district attorney's office said in a written statement. Rubashkin and his father, plant owner Abraham Aaron Rubashkin, face other serious allegations from the state of Iowa. The state has filed more than 9,000 misdemeanor charges against the owners and managers at Agriprocessors, accusing them of child labor law violations. The criminal complaint, filed by the office of Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, says the violations involved 32 youths under the age of 18, including seven under the age of 16.","NEW: Sholom Rubashkin appears in court, where he's ordered to limit travel .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- At least 10 people were killed in two explosions Friday in central Nairobi, the Kenya National Disaster Operation Centre said via Twitter. As many as 76 people were wounded in the blasts at the Gikomba market and on a public minibus, the disaster agency said. Ambulances evacuated 43 injured males and 33 injured females, the Centre said via Twitter. Two suspects were arrested in connection with the explosions, which were caused by grenades, according to Nairobi Police Commandant Benson Kibuye. There have been no claims of responsibility in the attack. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta expressed his sympathy to those affected by the blasts, the Interior Ministry said via Twitter. The explosions came after the United States, Australia and UK issued travel alerts for the African nation Thursday. Hundreds of vacationers were evacuated from Kenya the same day in response to the alerts, which warned of a ""high threat"" of terrorist attacks. Kenyan authorities described the warnings as ""unfriendly acts"" and said security remains a top priority. ""Terrorism is not an evil that was born in Kenya, terrorism is a world wide phenomenon,"" the Kenyan President said in his state of the union address. As he delivered that speech Friday, the blasts rocked the central part of the capital. The Kenyan military crossed into Somalia in 2011 to battle the terrorist group Al-Shabaab, which it blamed for kidnapping tourists in the coastal region. In retaliation, the terrorist group has launched a spate of attacks, including targeting bustling bus stations with grenades. Last year, militants stormed the Westgate Mall in Nairobi and held shoppers under siege for days. At least 67 people were killed. CNN's Azadeh Ansari reported and wrote from Atlanta.

"Washington (CNN) -- A federal review cites poor judgment by a security guard who found a bag outside a government building in Detroit last year and stashed it under a desk where it remained for weeks -- with neither the guard nor anyone else in the building aware that it contained a bomb. The report by the Homeland Security Department's office of inspector general released on Wednesday also said the guard's employer, a contractor, and the federal agency that oversees security at the Patrick V. McNamara Federal Building shared some responsibility as well for the bomb going undetected. ""Although the IED (improvised explosive device) did not explode, it represented a risk to the safety and security of the building and its occupants,"" the report said. Previously on CNN.com: Terrorism task force investigates origins of Detroit package . After the bomb was discovered it was detonated harmlessly by Detroit police. A Michigan man subsequently was charged with placing the device in a canvas bag outside the building. The canvas bag, containing a small locked Sentry safe, was discovered February 26, 2011, outside the 27-story building that houses the FBI and other offices and remained at the guard desk until it was identified as a threat three weeks later. During that time, at least two employees X-rayed it in an unsuccessful attempt to determine its contents. One guard shook it in another failed attempt to learn more, and a federal inspector conducted four routine checks of the guard post without discovering that the bag contained an explosive device, according to the report by the inspector general, an independent watchdog. Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the top Democrat on the Republican-led House Homeland Security Committee, asked for the audit to determine whether the guard's actions violated the private security company's contract with the Federal Protective Service (FPS), the government entity that protects federal property. The assistant inspector general for inspections, Carlton Mann, concluded the contractor, DECO Inc., ""committed multiple breaches of its contract"" with the Federal Protective Service. But the report found that the shortcomings ""were the result of poor judgment by the guard, not systemic problems with DECO."" Company officials had reason to believe the guard, who was not identified, ""should have known how to respond to the bag,"" the report said. In addition to receiving refresher training just three months before the incident, the guard was a sergeant with the Detroit Police Department. One FPS official asserted that he was one of the best guards in the building, the report said. But on the day of the incident, the guard ""misidentified the bag as found property and never treated it as suspicious, despite not knowing its contents,"" the report said. The bag was placed under the security desk in the McNamara building, where other security guards did not consider it suspicious because the space was used to store found property and personal belongings. The Federal Protective Service ""also bears some responsibility for the bag ... remaining in the building for 21 days,"" the report said. An FPS inspector did not identify the explosive during four inspections, noting each time that the post was ""clean and orderly"" and ""free of unauthorized items."" On March 18, 2011 -- 21 days after the bag's discovery -- two guards grew suspicious and screened it. When they could not identify the contents, they notified an FPS inspector, who determined the bag possibly contained an explosive and took appropriate action, the report said. Following the incident, DECO fired the guard in question. Previously on CNN.com: Guard suspended after suspicious package abandoned in federal building . ""The guard's actions were serious breaches that cannot be compared easily to other breaches by this company or other guard service companies because there is little precedent,"" the report said. DECO also fired a guard and a supervisor who X-rayed the bag and incorrectly identified its contents. A second supervisor resigned before being fired, the report said. Numerous others were suspended, given written warnings, or retrained, it said. Both the Federal Protective Service and DECO told federal auditors they have taken steps to avoid a similar lapse. DECO put in place a plan of corrective action and the FPS is extending DECO's contract in three-month increments. It plans to solicit a new contract for guard services in Michigan.","A federal review cites poor judgment for undiscovered IED in Detroit in 2011 .

"(CNN) -- The United Methodist Church announced Monday it is dropping its denominational case against a New York clergyman who officiated his son's same-sex wedding. The Rev. Thomas Ogletree was charged by the church after presiding over the wedding of his son to another man on October 20, 2012, according to a statement from the New York Annual Conference (NYAC) of the United Methodist Church. The Methodist church says it welcomes members regardless of sexual orientation, but same-sex marriages cannot be performed in Methodist churches or by ordained ministers under church policy. An official church trial was set for Ogletree, in which his case would have been heard by a jury of 13 ordained clergy members with a penalty ranging from a reprimand to a full defrocking. Following an additional meeting among the church counsels, the decision was made to reach a ""just resolution agreement"" instead of a trial, said the statement. ""Church trials produce no winners,"" NYAC Bishop Martin McLee said in a statement Monday, stating that such prosecutions result in ""harmful polarization and continue the harm brought upon our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters."" The case began when a fellow clergyman who had seen the wedding announcement for Ogletree's son in The New York Times filed a complaint with the bishop of the conference, according to the statement. The complaint set in motion a formal disciplinary process with McLee, who then referred the case to counsel for the church, the equivalent of a prosecutor. After the case was reviewed, it was determined that there was sufficient evidence to warrant charges against Ogletree for his violations, the statement said. ""I could not with any integrity as a Christian refuse my son's request to preside at his wedding,"" Ogletree said in a statement in January. ""It is a shame that the church is choosing to prosecute me for this act of love,"" the January statement said. Ogletree is a retired professor and a past dean of the Yale Divinity School. As part of Monday's resolution, Ogletree agreed to join others from varying perspectives in a public forum that ""shall reflect a variety of different opinions and understandings,"" according to the just resolution agreement. Ogletree released a statement Monday relinquishing his right to the trial and accepting McLee's intention to ""approach the matter of marriage equality in a non-juridical manner."" The decision comes just months after Pennsylvania pastor, Frank Schaefer, was defrocked in December after being found guilty in a church trial for officiating his own son's same-sex wedding. ""On first blush it doesn't seem fair,"" Schaefer said on Monday, ""two United Methodist Ministers are charged with the exact same 'crime' of officiating at their son's same sex weddings -- one is defrocked, the other one's case is dropped without conditions."" Schaefer went on to say that despite the different outcomes, overall he is happy about the church's decision to drop Ogletree's case. ""It is a victory for the LGBT movement...if trials are part of the reason why things are changing now in the United Methodist church, it will have been worth my sacrifice,"" Schaefer said.","The Rev.

"(CNN) -- A Pennsylvania minister was defrocked on Thursday after he was found guilty in a church trial for officiating his son's same-sex wedding, according to church officials. Frank Schaefer, 51, the pastor at Zion United Methodist Church of Iona in Lebanon, had already been suspended for 30 days in November after a jury of 13 clergy members found him guilty of officiating a same-sex wedding and being disobedient to the discipline and order of the church, according to Cathy Husid-Shamir, a Schaefer family spokeswoman. During his 30-day suspension, Schaefer was to decide whether his advocacy on behalf of the LGBT community would prevent him from fully complying with church law in the future, according to a statement from Bishop Peggy Johnson of the United Methodist Church. Schaefer told the Board of Ordained Ministry Thursday that he could not uphold the church's Book of Discipline in its entirety because it discriminates against gay people. Schaefer was asked to immediately surrender his credentials, but he refused, forcing church officials to defrock him, the statement said. ""I am somewhat in shock still,"" Schaefer said at a news conference Thursday. ""When I went into the hearing this morning,"" he said, ""I was hopeful that it wouldn't come to what it has come to."" Schaefer previously told CNN's Zoraida Sambolin that his son, Tim, asked him to officiate his wedding seven years ago, and he decided to do it ""out of love for him."" Although he once believed that homosexuality was incompatible with his Christian beliefs, Schaefer said his views on the controversial topic evolved. ""By the time our son came out, I was ready to embrace him,"" Schaefer told Sambolin. The complaint was filed by one of Schaefer's church members, and the church leadership decided to act upon it, according to Schaefer. The church told Schaefer he could avoid a trial if he agreed never to perform another same-sex marriage. He refused. ""I can't commit to a statement like that, especially in light of the fact that I have two more children that are gay,"" said Schaefer, who has four children. He said he has already filed an appeal and hopes to become reinstated to the Methodist clergy. Schaefer's case will now be reviewed by the appeals committee of the United Methodist Church's northeast jurisdiction. It could also go to the judicial counsel which is equivalent to the supreme court of the church, according to Schaefer's attorney, Bill Ewing. ""I have been a part of this church for more than 20 years,"" Schaefer said Thursday. ""Being a United Methodist minister is the only kind of minister I know how to be."" Ewing expects the appeal to be tried some time in 2015. Asked of his plans until then, Schaefer said, ""I will continue to be a voice for the LGBT community.""","Rev.

"(CNN) -- A band of insurgents dressed in U.S. Army uniforms waged a deadly assault on U.S.-British military complex in Afghanistan before being beaten back by coalition forces, NATO's International Security Assistance Force said Saturday. Two U.S. Marines and 14 insurgents died in the ""sustained"" fighting during the Friday-night attack, ISAF said. The Taliban claimed responsibility, saying the strike was in response to the anti-Islam film stoking anger across the Muslim world. ISAF said the attack started just after 10 p.m. Friday when about 15 insurgents -- organized into three teams -- waged an assault on the airfield of a complex that includes American-run Camp Leatherneck and the British-run Camp Bastion, where British royal Prince Harry is stationed. Wearing U.S. army uniforms, the attackers toted automatic rifles, rocket-propelled grenade launchers and suicide vests. One of their teams was able to breach the perimeter fence, at one point, according to ISAF. The insurgents inflicted considerable damage around the base, including destroying six AV-8B Harrier jets and damaging two others. Six aircraft hangers suffered damage, while six refueling stations were destroyed. The violence ended after coalition troops killed all but one of the attackers. The lone survivor was wounded and taken into custody, ISAF said. Eight coalition military personnel and one civilian contractor were also wounded. An ISAF statement detailing the attack gave no indication how the insurgents might have obtained U.S. Army uniforms. Earlier Saturday, ISAF said the camp is secure and the strike would not ""impact"" air and ground operations. Camp Leatherneck, the U.S. side of the base, was not affected by the attack, Maj. Adam N. Wojack, an ISAF spokesman, told CNN. White House says Karzai, Obama committed to preventing Afghan riots . The assault occurred amid anger over the film denigrating the Prophet Mohammed. Angry protests tied to the film, a trailer of which was posted online on YouTube in July but only gained widespread attention this month, have occurred in recent days at American and other Western diplomatic missions across the Muslim world. Still, despite such protests and the Taliban claim tying the attack to the film, ISAF spokesman Maj. Martin Crighton said there had no organized demonstrations outside its gates before the attack. A week ago Friday, Prince Harry arrived in Afghanistan for a tour as an Apache helicopter pilot in the British military, Defense Ministry said. He is deployed at Camp Bastion with the 100-strong 662 Squadron, 3 Regiment Army Air Corps. Harry, the grandson of Queen Elizabeth II and third in line to the British throne, is a captain in Britain's Army Air Corps. The prince ""was in no way in any danger"" during the latest attack, Crighton said. Violence has been rife in Helmand and other parts of southern Afghanistan, which is considered the Taliban heartland, since a U.S.-led force first went into the country after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Separately, the British Defense Ministry on Saturday announced the deaths of two members of the 3rd Battalion of that nation's army in Helmand province. A man wearing an Afghan police uniform fatally shot the two soldiers at a checkpoint in the south of the province's Nahr-e Saraj district, Maj. Laurence Roche, a spokesman for Task Force Helmand, said in a statement released by the British defense ministry. This is the latest so-called insider or green-on-blue attack in which members of Afghan security forces are suspected of turning their weapons on coalition or Afghan soldiers. It was not immediately known where the incident occurred and where the slain service members were from. Another British soldier died Saturday in a separate incident in Nahr-e Saraj, according to the UK defense ministry. This troop was killed when the vehicle in which he was traveling in struck a bomb.

"(CNN) -- One of us is British and the other American. But we have many important things in common. Both of us are in the military and were deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. We're both proud to serve and fight for our countries -- and both of us have served successfully. But when our military colleagues found out that we are transgender, our careers took different paths. Here are our stories: . British Royal Air Force Flight Lt. Caroline Paige:  As a flight lieutenant, I serve as a navigator flying Merlin Battlefield Helicopters with the British Royal Air Force. The role of my squadron is to support the Army: from inserting assault troops, to resupply of austere bases, to escorting road convoys to casualty evacuation, and many other tasks. I am proud of the role my country plays in trying to stem the flow of global terrorism. I am proud of the military and the people who risk their lives -- in Britain and elsewhere around the world -- to do this and I am proud of my own military service. I am also a transgender woman; I have known this all my conscious life, but my military didn't know until I told them after 18 years of service to the Air Force. Because of my country's inclusive military policy, I was allowed to remain in the RAF and became the first transgender officer to serve openly in the UK military, and I have done so proudly for 16 years. It wasn't easy at first, because people fear what they don't know. I set out to prove them wrong by ensuring there was no difference in my capabilities or who I was in my job. When my aircraft first deployed to Iraq in 2005, and then again to Afghanistan in 2009, I made sure I was there. As the squadron's lead tactician and defensive aids expert, I had to lead from the front to ensure the safety of our UK soldiers and our allies. To fly into perilous locations requires that you know precise procedures like the back of your hand, and on several occasions I was at the right place at the right time to identify issues and trouble shoot problems with the aircraft's equipment, earning the respect and admiration of my peers and superiors. My service and performance were rewarded with several commendations for ""excellent service"" -- first in 2007 with a two-star award, followed by Commendation from the Commander-in-Chief of Air Command in the 2012 New Year's Honours List. All of my endeavors on operations were focused on ensuring our aircraft had the best possible protection, through equipment and tactics. Had I not been able to continue my military service because I was transgender, I wouldn't have been in the right place at the right time to make that vital difference for my colleagues and my nation. Former U.S. Navy Petty Officer Landon Wilson: In August of 2013, I left my parent command in Hawaii and arrived on the East Coast to begin training to deploy to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. For three months of training, I was ""one of the guys,"" and no one questioned my gender or referred to me as a woman. For those three months, I didn't feel like I had to walk on eggshells, and I didn't worry about being outed as transgender. After a pit stop in Qatar in November, where my senior leaders laughed at their mistake in trying to put me in a female barracks room, I landed in Afghanistan, and was immediately put to work. As a junior sailor, I found myself in a place I had never imagined: working as the lead liaison between foreign militaries, such as the British Armed Forces and the Australian Defence Force; as well as domestic governmental agencies, including the CIA, FBI, and NSA. I was proud to serve my country in a mission-critical role. But three weeks later, everything changed: My senior chief pulled me aside and escorted me into the sergeant major's office. In front of him sat my original enlistment paperwork, which listed me as female. Within hours, I was put on a C-130 back to the U.S. With my departure, there was no one trained to fill my position in Afghanistan. Someone must have thought I was doing a good job, because three days after the Navy sent me back to Hawaii, I was promoted and given a Flag Letter of Commendation from the Admiral of 10th Fleet. But at the same time it was promoting me, the Navy was preparing my discharge papers. In March of 2014, I was honorably discharged for being transgender. Caroline Paige and Landon Wilson: After serving in Operation Enduring Freedom, we and others attended the first-ever gathering of currently serving transgender personnel from around the world to share our stories. Some of the 18 nations that allow transgender service members to serve openly were represented at this recent conference in Washington, D.C., sponsored by the ACLU and Palm Center. As members of the military community, it is not our place to tell civilian leaders what to do. We do want to be sure, however, that people understand the main message emerging from our personal stories, and from the experiences of service members from other forces who participated in the conference: Transgender personnel serve just as effectively as everyone else, even in austere environments like Afghanistan. Just like nontransgender personnel, we care about doing our jobs well, so that our militaries can fulfill their missions. If and when our two countries come to follow the same policy, we are sure that the adjustment will be successful.","One writer British, one American. Both are transgender and served in Afghanistan .

"New York (CNN) -- Douglas Kennedy, the son of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, was acquitted Tuesday of harassment and child endangerment charges. He had been accused of twisting a nurse's arm and kicking another nurse in January as he tried to leave the maternity ward of a suburban New York City hospital with his newborn son.

The 21-year-old Germany international set up four goals and scored one himself as the home side moved ahead of previous leaders Bayer Leverkusen on goal difference, with both teams on 26 points. Unbeaten Leverkusen can regain their lead in Sunday's trip to ailing former champions Bayern Munich, while Hamburg can move up to 26 points with victory at home to Bochum. But Bremen ensured bragging rights for at least 24 hours with a demolition job that left Freiburg just two points above the bottom three. Daniel Jansen and Ozil both hit the woodwork before the latter crossed for striker Hugo Almeida to head home the 33rd-minute opener. Marko Marin doubled the lead 10 minutes after halftime with a freekick, then Ozil teed up Almeida's second soon after before making it 4-0 on 67 as he collected a long ball and rounded goalkeeper Simon Pouplin. Ozil was fouled in the box by Mohamadou Idrissou to allow Naldo to score from the spot six minutes later, and his cross from the left was converted by Markus Rosenberg on 82. Schalke moved up to third place with a 2-0 win at home to Hannover, who were mourning the suicide of Germany goalkeeper Robert Enke. There was a minute's silence before the game to commemorating his death, but it was Schalke who took the lead in the 69th minute as Jefferson Farfan headed home Rafinha's corner. Jan Moravek sealed victory in the second minute of time added on after Enke's deputy Florian Fromlowitz blocked a shot by Lukas Schmitz, meaning Schalke ended a three-game winless run -- and extended their unbeaten run to seven -- to move onto 25 points. Defending champions Wolfsburg lost 3-2 at home to Nuremberg, who moved out of the bottom three thanks to Peer Kluge's last-gasp winner three minutes into stoppage time. Ten-man Stuttgart had to come from behind to earn a 1-1 draw at home to bottom club Hertha Berlin, as Zdravko Kuzmanovic's 82nd-minute effort canceled out the 49th-minute opener by Adrian Ramos. However, the Serbian was sent off three minutes later for a second booking, but struggling Stuttgart held on. Hoffenheim crushed Cologne 4-0 to move above Hamburg on goal difference, while Borussia Monchengladbach moved away from the relegation zone with a 2-1 victory at Eintracht Frankfurt. Borussia Dortmund hosted Mainz in the late match.","Werder Bremen snatch top spot in Bundesliga on goal difference after crushing Freiburg 6-0 .

"(CNN) -- A prehistoric roar drowns out the delighted squeals of children madly dashing out of the path of the giant creature plodding towards them. They need not hurry. The fantastical 48-ton elephant with flapping leather ears and undulating wooden trunk takes his time as he huffs and puffs his way across the park. Welcome to Les Machines de L'lle -- a former shipping yard turned mechanical animal ""dream factory,"" in the industrial port city of Nantes, in northwest France. Dockyard to dream factory . The once dilapidated warehouses lining the riverfront have been transformed into a type of psychedelic Santa's workshop, with artists building everything from enormous flying herons to a carousel revolving with deep sea creatures. But these whimsical animals are more than simply elaborate children's toys. They're moving works of art, available for the public to climb on board and experience a retro fantasyland that ""blends the invented worlds of Jules Verne and the mechanical universe of Leonardo Di Vinci."" ""The animals are conceived to be 'traveling machines' instead of big thrills entrainment,"" said its co-artistic director Francois Delaroziere. ""It's the desire to conceive a city through a common imagination, in which the public becomes an actor."" The remarkable amusement park is the brainchild of La Machine, a street theater company famous for such creations as the 15-meter spider that crawled through Liverpool, in Britain, as part of the city's Capital of Culture celebrations in 2008. In 2007, the $19 million Les Machine de L'lle opened in the hope of regenerating Nantes' deserted dockyards, which had been in decay since closing in 1987. Backed by the local Metropole, the 337-hectare site is now one of the largest urban projects in Europe. Free to the public, anyone can wander around the workshops filled with artists hammering and carving their latest creations -- though if you want to clamber on one of the marvelous animals, you'll need to buy a ticket. Vintage Verne . The 25-meter tall Marine Worlds Carousel is the park's newest attraction, featuring 24 mechanical waves and three levels of rotating sea creatures -- from slack-jawed lantern fish to wriggling squid. The animals' hand-carved vintage style has a charming Steampunk quality -- a genre of science-fiction featuring steam-powered machinery. The alluring aesthetic is all the more fitting, considering Nantes is also the birthplace of 19th century writer Jules Verne. Indeed, the sea monsters of his famous novel ""20,000 Leagues under the Sea"" come alive in the glowing merry-go-round teetering on the water's edge. The 12-meter tall elephant -- lumbering beneath an ornate balcony of waving passengers -- is also reminiscent of Verne's book ""The Steam House,"" featuring a group of colonialists living in a wheeled house pulled by a steam-powered elephant. Making a move . The Great Elephant may amble across the park at a gentle three kilometers per hour, but inside he's a hive of activity -- propelled by a 450-horse power motor, 60 cylinders, 2,000-liters of oil, and a complex system of jacks, pulleys and gears. A steel skeleton forms the base of the wooden body -- replete with wrinkles carved beneath the blinking eyes. But the hydraulic beast isn't quite left to roam free, with an on-board driver steering him across the park, spraying onlookers with water from his rippling trunk. ""Sketchbooks are a starting point in creative process,"" says Delaroziere. ""They offer ideas for the seizing, define the rules of the game, and provide a rich basis for builders to begin constructing their interpretations on."" Real big things . The fantastical world of Jules Verne looms large at Les Machines de L'lle. But there's a distinct difference between the French author's pioneering novels and the psychedelic Steampunk park of his birthplace. As Delaroziere says: ""Jules Verne's creations remain imaginary. Whereas we built real machines.""","Fantastical mechanical animals roam $19m French amusement park .

"(CNN) -- Friend or foe? The first corner of the Canadian Grand Prix Sunday could settle the state of the fractious relationship between Mercedes rivals Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton. Rosberg pipped his English stablemate to pole position by just 0.079 seconds in qualifying at the Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve to set up a sizzling start to the race. Facing the media in Montreal after his Monaco fallout with Rosberg, Hamilton said the spat was ""done and dusted"". He explained: ""We spoke after the race and just like friends we have our ups and down, we've known each other a long, long time."" It was Rosberg who did the talking on track Saturday, eking out extra pace on his final timed lap round the tricky, temporary circuit on the Ile Notre Dame. The German, who leads Hamilton by four points in the Formula 1 world championship, set a quickest time of one minute, 14.874 seconds. ""I'm very, very happy it all worked out,"" Rosberg told reporters. ""It's been a fantastic day and the best position for tomorrow."" Hamilton, who was upset after being unable to set his potentially quickest time in Monaco because of an error by Rosberg on his final lap, appeared to lock up as he chased down his teammate's leading time in Montreal. Asked by reporters if it would be another tight race between himself and his teammate he said succinctly: ""I would assume so, yes."" Red Bull's reigning world champion Sebastian Vettel defied expectation to finish third with a brilliant final lap. ""I tried to take more risks and it worked,"" said Vettel, who out-qualified his teammate Daniel Ricciardo for just the second time this season. ""I kept it going until the end so all in all a good result and the maximum we could do. ""I'll try and stay as close I can to those two and maybe get some tow. If we have the chance to attack them then we'll go for it."" The Williams, powered by the dominant Mercedes turbo engine, performed well in Canada to show signs of finally coming good on its pre-season promise. Valtteri Bottas will line up for the Canadian Grand Prix in fourth ahead of his teammate Felipe Massa and Ricciardo.","Nico Rosberg takes pole position for the Canadian Grand Prix Sunday .

"(CNN) -- A legal defense fund for an Oklahoma City police officer accused of sexually assaulting several women was dealt a setback by a social media website that shut down one of the fundraising efforts, the officer's family said Thursday. Officer Daniel Holtzclaw, 27, is being held in jail in lieu of a $500,000 bond and faces 16 charges for allegedly sexually assaulting several women while on the job, according to the Oklahoma County Sheriff's Office. His bond was reduced Wednesday from $5 million. Holtzclaw's family raised more than $7,300 on GoFundMe before the website shut down the ""Justice for Daniel Holtzclaw"" fundraiser, said Jennifer Holtzclaw, the officer's sister. ""We raised a little over $7,300 before the 5% that is actually taken out for GoFundMe's fee. I am going to reach out to them again today and ask for that 5% back as they approved for the page to go up,"" Jennifer Holtzclaw told CNN. She also sent an angry letter of complaint to GoFundMe and stated that ""within just a few days we had more than $7,000 raised because people do believe in Daniel's innocence and not into the media hype that everyone is believing into!!!!"" In an email Tuesday from GoFundMe to Jennifer Holtzclaw, the website said it ""reviews campaigns that have received a high number of complaints on a case-by-case basis. In this particular case, your campaign contains subject matter that GoFundMe would rather not be associated with."" In an email to CNN, GoFundMe said it reviews campaigns that draw ""a high volume of complaints."" ""In this particular case, GoFundMe determined that the fundraising campaign titled 'Justice for Daniel Holtzclaw' would be removed from the site,"" the firm said. The company didn't elaborate. The Holtzclaw fundraising campaign has also drawn controversial comments on its Facebook page, as family members acknowledged on that site that they turn off the comments field at night ""so we can get some needed rest from deleting horrible comments,"" wrote relative Leslie A. Holtzclaw. The family is now raising funds for Daniel Holtzclaw's bail through a PayPal email account listed on a Facebook page. That account was established late Wednesday and Jennifer Holtzclaw didn't have an immediate figure on how much has been raised, she said. The family is also selling ""Free The Claw"" and ""#Justice4DanielHoltzclaw"" T-shirts for $25 and has sold 32 shirts for the legal fund, Jennifer Holtzclaw said. Daniel Holtzclaw has been in jail since his arrest last month. In the Oklahoma County courthouse on Wednesday, a judge entered a not guilty plea on behalf of Daniel Holtzclaw, who was silent in the face of charges of sexually assaulting eight women while in uniform or in his patrol car on the city's northeast side, CNN affiliate KOCO reported. If Holtzclaw is able to post bond, he would be placed under house arrest in the Enid home of his father, Eric, who is a lieutenant with the Enid Police Department, according to the affiliate and the family's Facebook pages.","GoFundMe approves then shuts down a fundraiser for Officer Daniel Holtzclaw .

"(CNN) -- Fearing that flocks of unmanned aircraft might soon traverse U.S. skies, the Federal Aviation Administration on Friday quickly appealed a judge's ruling that the agency does not have the authority to regulate commercial drones. The case involves Raphael Pirker, a drone enthusiast fined $10,000 by the FAA for using his 56-inch foam glider to take promotional videos of the University of Virginia Medical Center. The FAA said Pirker's flight ran afoul of its strict rules governing the commercial use of drones. On Friday, less than 24 hours after losing its case, the FAA said it was appealing the decision by Patrick Geraghty, an administrative law judge with the National Transportation Safety Board. ""The agency is concerned that this decision could impact ... the safety of people and property on the ground,"" the FAA said in a statement. Geraghty said FAA regulations approved for manned aircraft did not apply to unmanned aircraft any more than they applied to paper airplanes or balsa wood planes. Pirker's attorney, Brendan Schulman, called it ""a tremendously significant decision for model aircraft and commercial drone operators."" ""As a general matter, the decision finds that the FAA's 2007 policy statement banning the commercial use of model aircraft is not enforceable. It would appear to me to have a very significant impact on other operators,"" Schulman said. But the decision confounded the FAA, which as recently as last week had publicized its restrictions on commercial use of drones. In a press release headlined ""Busting Myths about the FAA and Unmanned Aircraft,"" it stressed that UAS enthusiasts could not use drones for commercial purposes. ""A commercial flight requires a certified aircraft, a licensed pilot and operating approval. To date, only one operation has met these criteria, using Insitu's ScanEagle, and authorization was limited to the Arctic,"" the FAA's Busting Myths release said. ""There are no shades of gray in FAA regulations,"" the FAA continued. ""Anyone who wants to fly an aircraft-manned or unmanned-in U.S. airspace needs some level of FAA approval."" The flight that got Pirker in trouble occurred October 17, 2011, when he remotely piloted a $130 RiteWing Zephyr II aircraft at the campus medical center. The FAA investigated, and the following April it proposed a $10,000 civil penalty, saying that Pirker operated the plane ""in a careless or reckless manner so as to endanger the life or property of another."" Pirker operated the aircraft within about 50 feet of numerous individuals, about 20 feet of a crowded street, and within approximately 100 feet of an active heliport at UVA, the FAA alleged. One person had to take ""evasive measures"" to avoid being struck by the aircraft, the agency said. Pirker appealed the case to the NTSB, where the case went before Geraghty. The FAA is appealing the matter to the full safety board.","Raphael Pirker remotely piloted a model plane for commercial purposes .

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- An attack that killed 25 people, mostly students, at a Nigerian school Monday night appeared to be ""an inside job"" in which the gunmen called out the names of their targets, a police spokesman told CNN Tuesday. ""The attackers went to the houses of the victims, called them out by their names and killed them,"" Adamawa State Police spokesman Mohammed Ibrahim said. ""They used guns and knives on the victims."" Some of the victims' throats were slit, he said.

"(CNN) -- Who would have thought it? Team Brazil just scraping by in a cliffhanger penalty kick shootout. But from here on out, where every game means somebody's going home, there's a 12th man on the field, a true equalizer -- roaring determination. And it nearly snatched victory for Chile. But Brazil's dream of winning a World Cup on its own soil has survived. It meets Colombia in the quarterfinals after it sent Uruguay home to join striker Luis Suarez, whom FIFA suspended for biting an Italian player last week. That may have cost Uruguay the game, but at the same time, Colombia has hit the World Cup like a whirlwind, and fans are swooning for their stand-out midfielder James Rodriguez. He has shot half of Colombia's total 10 goals in the tournament so far. Newby fans of Team USA soccer who left the television on over the weekend instead of waiting for America's faceoff with Belgium on Tuesday, must certainly have caught footy fever from Saturday's exhilarating matches. More to come, in the Round of 16 knockout matches -- see viewing times and channels below. Also included: a nice treat at bottom. Here's what to watch for: . 1. Hangovers . They may be epidemic in Brazil after the celebration parties. Three factors are at work here: . A. It was a Saturday night. B. Brazil won. C. Duh, it's Brazil during World Cup. But Brazil fans have a lot of time to recover from the party, since Brazil doesn't play again until Friday. If they win that quarterfinal match against Colombia, get ready of a repeat of last night. In the meantime, fans can take in two games on Sunday while vegging in front of the TV. 2. Offense vs. Defense . Netherlands vs. Mexico, noon ET Sunday, ESPN and Univision . The Dutch players could easily be mistaken for a road repair crew if they wear their hunter-orange jerseys on Sunday. But the color should be taken seriously as a symbol of how on fire they are. They have shot the most goals in group play at this year's World Cup -- 10, topping Germany and Brazil, which had seven each. They dominated their group, roundly stomping reigning world champ Spain 5-1 in their first game. But offense isn't everything, as Mexico's team will attest. They practically put a brick wall in front of their goal during group play, allowing just one ball to get in. They held Brazil to a 0-0 tie. All they need to do now is score more. Javier Hernandez might just have it in him. He's been quite a goal-getter in the past. And Dutch fans certainly make an impression parading down Brazil's streets in those bright jerseys. 3. Feels like the first time . Costa Rica vs. Greece, 4 p.m. ET Sunday, ESPN and Univision . They've never met before, FIFA says. Not once. And at the World Cup, this is only Costa Rica's third appearance, and only Greece's second. Costa Rica has shot twice as many goals so far as Greece, while allowing only one and putting away major contenders Italy and Uruguay. Sound like Greece is the underdog? FIFA ranks the team 12th in the world and Costa Rica 28th. 4. Line-dance craze . Colombia has not only won each of its games so far, it has also won the hearts of millions of fans. The spirit of the team's play, the scoring surge by Rodriguez. But crowds also love Colombia's signature celebration group dance. If Colombia continues its winning streak, it may catch on.

"(CNN) -- Australian Open champion Stanislas Wawrinka suffered a shock defeat against Andrey Golubev in Switzerland's David Cup quarterfinal tie with Kazakhstan in Geneva on Friday. Wawrinka who beat the odds to win his first major title against Rafa Nadal in Melbourne in January was on the receiving end of an upset this time as he fell to the world No. 64 Golubev 7-6 (7/5) 6-2 3-6 7-6 (7/5) in three hours 14 minutes. The 29-year-old cut a frustrated figure as his Kazakh opponent took control of the match winning the first-set tiebreak before racing through the second. Wawrinka rallied in the third before slumping to defeat in four sets. ""I'm really disappointed with myself but I have to give credit to Golubev,"" Wawrinka said, DavisCup.com reported. ""He was really aggressive and he found a way to win the match. I didn't play so well,"" he added. ""I was expecting more mistakes. I wasn't aggressive enough with my game. I'm really disappointed with the loss but have to accept it and be ready for tomorrow and a long weekend."" Wawrinka's loss was canceled out by Roger Federer a short time later as the former world No. 1 cruised to a straight sets win over Mikhail Kukushkin 6-4 6-4 6-2 to level the tie. The Swiss pair will now team up for Saturday's crucial doubles rubber against Evgeny Korolev and Aleksandr Nedovyesov. In Naples, the match between Britain and Italy is also finely poised with home side currently 1-0 up following Fabio Fognini's four-set 6-4 2-6 6-4 6-1 win over James Ward. A rain-delay at the start of the day meant that both singles rubbers couldn't be completed, but Andy Murray will have the edge when he and Andreas Seppi return to complete their match on Saturday morning. The Scot won the first set 6-4 and when bad light halted play the pair were tied at 5-5 in the second. In the remaining two ties, the situation is more clear cut after day one with Germany and the Czech Republic on course for a semifinal meeting. Germany, who are without Davis Cup regulars Tommy Haas, Philipp Kohlschreiber and Florian Mayer, raced to a 2-0 lead over France in Nancy. World No. 96 Tobias Kamke upset Julien Benneteau in straight sets 7-6 (10/8) 6-3 6-2 in the day's opening rubber before to Peter Gojowczyk, ranked 119 in the world, saw off world No. 12 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in a marathon five-setter 5-7 7-6 (7/3) 3-6 7-6 (10/8) 8-6.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Thousands of Kurds and their supporters poured into the streets of northern Iraqi cities on Thursday to protest the Turkish parliament's approval of cross-border raids into Iraq. Iraqi Kurdish youths wave their regional flag as they protest in Thursday in Irbil, Iraq. Some 10,000 demonstrators in Irbil, the capital of the Kurdish regional government, carried banners and signs and shouted ""no to Turkey."" Riot police were on hand, but there were no reports of disorderly conduct. In Duhuk, another mainly Kurdish city in northern Iraq, 5,000 demonstrators marched to the U.N. offices, according to The Associated Press. They presented a document asking the United Nations to stop Turkey from taking any military action in Iraq, the AP reported. Turkey's parliament on Wednesday voted to authorize cross-border actions by the country's military into Iraq to attack separatists from the Kurdistan Workers Party, known as the PKK.  Watch a new generation of protesters politicized » . That group, which operates largely in southeastern Turkey, has attacked Turkey from northern Iraq, and Turkey is intent on stopping that activity. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said the parliamentary vote wouldn't necessarily trigger immediate military action, and many analysts doubt that a full-scale invasion would be launched. Iraq and the United States oppose such cross-border action and hope they can persuade the Turks to deal with the PKK problem by diplomacy. Meetings this week with Turkish leaders about border tensions ""ended in good results,"" the office of an Iraqi vice president said Thursday. Tariq al-Hashimi, one of Iraq's two vice presidents, met with Turkish President Abdullah Gul, Erdogan and Foreign Minister Ali Babacan in Turkey's capital, Ankara. ""Before leaving Ankara, his excellency appealed to the Turkish government for restraint and to consider some time for the political efforts to take place in order to resolve the current crisis in the best possible way,"" al-Hashimi's office said. Al-Hashimi said he hopes the meetings result in a timely ""joint effort"" between the Iraqi and Turkish governments ""to stop the terrorist operations across the border."" He said such an effort will be successful through proper coordination over policies by ""the formation of joint committees to review the outstanding issues"" and a follow-up of bilateral security agreements. Iraqi President Jalal Talabani, visiting Paris for meetings with French leaders, called al-Hashimi's visit a success and said he does not ""believe that there is an imminent Turkish attack into northern Iraq and I hope that it will not happen."" ""We hope that the wisdom of our friend, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, is enough to prevent the Turkish military intervention,"" Talabani, who is Kurdish, said Wednesday. The Kurdistan regional government issued an appeal to ""our friend and neighbor Turkey to refrain from military action in Iraq"" and urged a political solution, rather than a military one, to the longstanding ""problem of the PKK."" ""A Turkish military attack on the Kurdistan region of Iraq would make the situation worse, complicating the prospects for a political solution in Turkey and threatening the fragile progress that is being made in Iraq,"" according to a statement posted on the government's Web site Wednesday. ""We do not interfere in the internal affairs of Turkey, and we expect the same in return,"" the statement said. The Kurdish region -- Duhuk, Irbil and Sulaimaniya provinces -- has had a close economic relationship with Turkey and said it considers good relations with Ankara a top priority. E-mail to a friend .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Firefighters in Southern California seemed Saturday to be winning the fight against the half dozen wildfires still burning. Santa Ana winds diminished significantly Friday, aiding first responders in their progress toward containment of the fires. Winds have shifted across much of Southern California, bringing cooler temperatures and higher humidity. Despite the reduction in winds, most of San Diego County continues to experience hot temperatures which, combined with dry conditions, allowed for at least one new wildfire to ignite. According to Cal Fire, a new 30-acre blaze began burning Saturday in Sycamore Canyon, inland from San Diego. Firefighters were able to stop it from spreading farther and no structures were threatened. On and around the Marine Corps' Camp Pendleton, six large wildfires remain active, having burned over 25,000 acres total. Since January 1, Cal Fire has responded to over 1,500 wildfires -- well above the average yearly number of approximately 800. This week's rash of wildfires is a reminder of just how dry conditions in California are. The agency is urging all Californians to ensure they are prepared by visiting ReadyForWildfire.org. At least four wildfires were completely contained early Saturday. Two more were nearly contained, and four others were steadily shrinking. But early Saturday, thousands of acres were still in flames that were driving walls of smoke skyward. The fire has scorched more than 31 square miles so far. The blazes in the state so far this year are ""unprecedented,"" Cal Fire Director Ken Pimlott has said. Flames have swallowed up dozens of homes and businesses. And the wildfire season has only just begun. Erica Bene was running errands at Camp Pendleton with her two children when she spotted a huge plume of smoke behind a school. A wildfire was coming her way despite progress made by an army of firefighters in San Diego County in quelling a spate of blazes this week. Bene, the wife of a U.S. Marine deployed to Afghanistan, headed home to pack up some important items and evacuate. ""I said 'let's go get the pets, and let's get out of here,"" she said. On the drive back home, orange flames raged. Shortly thereafter, the Marine Corps put out an evacuation order. The order spooked her 5-year-old son and 7-year-old daughter, but she explained that it didn't mean their house would burn down. The order just gave firefighters room to combat the blaze without having to worry about danger to residents. Her children are used to feeling uneasy because of their dad's dangerous deployment, Bene said. She took her children and the pets to a friend's home in nearby Temecula, where they plan to stay the night. By late Friday, the evacuation order had been lifted. If it remains lifted, she planned to go home Saturday. Arson arrests . Investigators have filed an arson charge against a man in one small fire in the county. At a news conference, the prosecutor identified him as Alberto Serrato, who's accused of adding brush onto an existing fire, District Attorney Bonnie Dumanis said. Serrato could face up to seven years in prison if convicted, Dumanis said Friday. Neither Serrato nor his attorney were immediately available for comment. Meanwhile, the prosecutor is weighing whether to press charges against a 19-year-old man and 17-year-old juvenile, both of Escondido, who were arrested Thursday in connection with a small fire that was extinguished, Dumanis said. Thousands on the move . Thousands of firefighters used air tankers, specially equipped DC-10s and military helicopters to douse the flames this week. Bene was just one of tens of thousands of residents to evacuate. In all, 176,000 notices of evacuation were sent throughout San Diego County via cell phone calls, e-mails, text messages and calls to homes and businesses, county Supervisor Dianne Jacob said. When Elisha Exon saw towers of smoke looming over her San Marcos, California, home, she knew it was time to go. The only problem: All the nearby places she'd normally take her family in an emergency were threatened by fire, too. ""You kind of feel like your only safety would be to hop town, completely,"" she said. Ash and smoke filled the air in many places, making breathing difficult. So far, injuries have been few: Authorities found a charred body in Carlsbad, but it was unknown whether the person died because of the fire. A Camp Pendleton firefighter suffered heat exhaustion. Homes in the crosshairs . Thousands of homes across the county are still in jeopardy. ""I've been doing this for 20 years,"" San Diego County Supervisor Bill Horn said. ""This is the worst I've seen."" Images from the fires were jarring. The night sky glowed orange from towering flames that consumed homes. Whirling columns of flame -- dubbed ""firenadoes"" or ""fire whirls"" -- spun across the landscape, in one case nearly devouring a hilltop home.

"POTTSVILLE, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- A fomer Pennsylvania high school football player  was acquitted of murder Friday in the beating death of a Mexican immigrant last summer. Luis Ramirez died of blunt force injuries after a confrontation with a group of Pennsylania teens. However, a Schuylkill County jury found Brandon Piekarsky and Derrick Donchak guilty of simple assault stemming from the death of Luis Ramirez, who died of blunt force injuries to the head after a fight with the defendants and their friends. Donchak, 19, was also found guilty of providing alcohol to the group of teens that encountered Ramirez the night of July 12 on a residential street in the rural mining town of Shenandoah. Both teens were acquitted of ethnic intimidation charges. Prosecutors alleged the teens baited the undocumented Mexican immigrant into a fight with racial epithets, provoking an exchange of punches and kicks that ended with Ramirez convulsing in the street, foaming from the mouth. He died two days later in a hospital in Danville. Piekarsky, 17, had faced a charge of third-degree murder for allegedly delivering a fatal kick to Ramirez's head after he was knocked to the ground. He also was found not guilty of ethnic intimidation, aggravated assault and attempting to solicit a cover-up. An all-white jury of six men and six women heard from several prosecution witnesses, including a juvenile co-defendant and another teen who pleaded guilty in federal court for his role in the fight. While the jury heard conflicting accounts about who initiated the encounter or delivered the final kick to Ramirez's head, defense lawyers attempted to place the blame on another co-defendant, who is facing charges in juvenile court, and Colin Walsh, who has pleaded guilty to violating Ramirez's civil rights. The juvenile admitted on the stand to shouting ""go home you Mexican [expletive]"" after the first fight dispersed, prompting Ramirez to turn back and attack him. The juvenile's testimony was corroborated by Walsh, who admitted to punching Ramirez and knocking him to the ground after he charged the juvenile. Both witnesses said Piekarsky delivered the final blow to Ramirez's head while he was on the ground, but others testified that they couldn't be certain who had actually kicked him. The incident drew national attention to the small town of Shenandoah, highlighting issues of race relations.

"(CNN) -- I once had a pet iguana. His name was Kramer, and he was the biggest, meanest thing you've ever seen. Without question, he spawned from the land of darkness, soon deciding his evil role in life was to make every day miserable for the Bellinis. And he accomplished this by whipping us mercilessly with his powerful tail. ""Good morning, Kramer."" Thwack! ""Screw you, lizard!"" Eventually, we tired of the physical and mental abuse and sold Kramer to man who might have been looking for an exotic pet, or, perhaps, an exotic pair of boots. Either way, this poor guy was getting an exotic tail straight to the neck. Buyer beware. Thwack! ""Screw you, lizard!"" As Kramer's new owner drove away from our house, thus ended my childhood interest in any pet not covered in fur. For it's hard to be vicious when your primary objective in life is to sleep eighteen hours a day. But, hey, plenty of other people still enjoy their weird, exotic pets, and this week I stumbled upon a fascinating, if not completely fabricated, story that was trending all over the Web. It was about a tortoise in Brazil who turned up alive and well after going missing from its family more than 30 years ago. The story, as recounted by several news agencies and websites who seemed not to find anything particularly odd about the details of this miracle, goes like this: . In 1982, Manuela the tortoise vanished from her home in Rio. The Almeida family searched everywhere (well, almost), and finally settled on the perceived reality that, maybe, after workers left a door open, their beloved tortoise just up and decided to leave. Mind you, very slowly. Now, fast forward 30 years to earlier this month, when the father of the house sadly passed away. The family, despite their grief, eventually decided it was time to go through the old man's stuff, which was piled high in a second-floor bedroom that was always kept locked. That's when the son, Leandro, discovered Manuela inside a box with a record player. Presumably listening to old Boz Scaggs 45s. Tortoises. They're into that. The family daughter, Lenita, was shocked more than anyone to be reunited with her childhood pet. ""We're all thrilled to have Manuela back,"" she said. ""But no one can understand how she managed to survive for 30 years in there. It's just unbelievable."" Yes. It is. However, a local vet theorized that the notoriously resilient red-footed tortoise, which could have survived long periods without food, possibly snacked on termites. Which explains why, after three decades locked in a room, the first thing she asked for was an In-N-Out burger. ""Get me a Double Double up in here. Animal style, yo!"" Of course, there's also the question of water. Specifically, ""Where was it?"" Nothing I read adequately covered this rather important detail, and I didn't exactly raise the bar very high. I literally would've accepted ""magic"" as a suitable answer. So, who knows? But, anyway, that's the (possibly) amazing animal story trending out of Brazil. And the Web absolutely loves it. Though, remarkably, Manuela isn't the only pet tortoise who has recently found its way into the world's collective consciousness. There's also Sammy -- the beloved 100-pound companion of San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who will be playing in Super Bowl XLVII this weekend in New Orleans. Kaepernick. Not Sammy. Though, the latter would be far more interesting. Especially when it starts eating the 30-yard-line. ""This tastes terrible."" ""It's synthetic turf."" ""Well, I'll be damned."" Munch. Munch. ""Say, aren't you Beyonce?"" Anyway, there's my feeble attempt to somehow relate all this to the Super Bowl. Naturally, Sammy the tortoise won't be on Kaepernick's mind on Sunday when he takes on the Baltimore Ravens. But there's a pretty good chance you'll hear about the exotic pet in one of those over-produced, pregame mini-biopics. Perhaps even punctuated by the music of Boz Scaggs. Tortoises. They're into that.","""Apparently This Matters"" is CNN Tech's weekly look at offbeat topics trending online .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Water with trace amounts of radioactivity may have leaked for months from a U.S. Navy nuclear-powered submarine as it traveled around the Pacific to ports in Guam, Japan and Hawaii, Navy officials told CNN on Friday. The USS Houston arrives in Pearl Harbor for routine maintenance, during which the leak was found. The leak was found on the USS Houston, a Los Angeles-class fast attack submarine, after it went to Hawaii for routine maintenance last month, Navy officials said. Navy officials said the amount of radiation leaked into the water was virtually undetectable. But the Navy alerted the Japanese government because the submarine had been docked in Japan. The problem was discovered last month when a build-up of leaking water popped a covered valve and poured onto a sailor's leg while the submarine was in dry dock. An investigation found a valve was slowly dripping water from the sub's nuclear power plant. The water had not been in direct contact with the nuclear reactor, Navy officials said. Officials with knowledge of the incident could not quantify the amount of radiation leaked but insisted it was ""negligible"" and an ""extremely low level."" The total amount leaked while the sub was in port in Guam, Japan and Hawaii was less than a half of a microcurie (0.0000005 curies), or less than what is found in a 50-pound bag of lawn and garden fertilizer, the officials said. The sailor who was doused, a Houston crew member, tested negative for radiation from the water, according to Navy officials. Since March, the Houston had crisscrossed the western Pacific, spending a week in Japan and several weeks in both Guam and Hawaii, Navy officials said.  See a timeline of the sub's movements » . The Navy on Friday notified the Japanese government of the leak, the officials said, and told them it was possible the ship had been leaking while in port in Sasebo, Japan, in March. While Japan has agreed to allow U.S. nuclear-powered ships in Japanese ports, the decision was a not popular in Japan. The Houston incident comes at a time when the Navy is trying to smooth over a problem with a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. The USS George Washington was due to replace the aging, conventionally powered USS Kitty Hawk this summer as the United States' sole carrier based in Japan. While en route to Japan this May, a massive fire broke out on the George Washington, causing $70 million in damage. The fire was blamed on crew members smoking near improperly stored flammable materials. There was no damage or threat to the nuclear reactor, but the ship was diverted to San Diego, California, for repairs. It now is expected to arrive in Japan at the end of September. The Navy this week fired the captain and his deputy, saying an investigation into the fire led to a lack of confidence in the leadership of both men. Just two weeks ago, thousands of Japanese protested the pending arrival of the George Washington.","Leak was found on the USS Houston during routine maintenance last month .

"(CNN) -- Superman is looking better than ever. In August, a pristine copy of Action Comics No. 1, containing the origin story of the Man of Steel, sold for more than $3.2 million on eBay. But even if you don't have that kind of dough, you can see what the historic issue -- rated 9 out of 10 by CGC Comics, an independent grading authority -- looks like thanks to a scan the company posted on its website. ""I think the first impression in my mind is just like it came off the newsstand,"" said Paul Litch, a 15-year veteran of CGC, who did the final grading of the comic book for the company. ""It was absolutely fresh and amazing."" Though Action Comics No. 1 is best known for the Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster story that created Superman, the issue -- which has been rarely reprinted in full -- has several other tales inside. There's ""Chuck Dawson,"" foe of crooked cattlemen; ""Zatara: Master Magician,"" ""champion of law and order""; and ""Scoop Scanlon, Five Star Reporter,"" who uncovers corruption with the help of photographer pal Rusty James. And that's not all! According to an ad on the inside front cover, you could win a dollar (that's in 1938 bucks, incidentally) for hand-coloring the title page of ""Chuck Dawson"" with your very own crayons. However, for those of you who actually own a copy of Action Comics No. 1, this is not encouraged. The scan has been available since talk of the auction began in July. But even after the actual, physical comic book was purchased by Metropolis/ComicConnect on August 24, it's stayed up. Litch says CGC has no plans to take it down. It's certainly boosted site traffic: In the three months since the scan was posted, sessions are up more than 50% from the previous three-month period. Users are up 166%. The scan has received more than 52,000 page views, CGC reports. David Tosh, an auctioneer specializing in comics with Heritage Auctions in Dallas, says that posting a full scan of a classic comic is ""unusual,"" but he believes it's beneficial to everybody -- including DC Comics, which owns the rights to Superman. (DC Comics is a unit of Time Warner, as is CNN.) ""The scans were done as a historical item, rather than something that would be published, and the book has been reprinted a number of times anyway,"" he said. ""It's all good publicity."" The process of scanning won't do any damage to the value of the comic book, he adds. A lot of the classic books of the '30s and '40s that have been reprinted in book editions are scanned from originals themselves. Also, having online copies available doesn't affect their collectability. ""Most collectors today are not like they were in the 1970s and '80s, when they were buying comics because they liked to read them,"" he said. ""Comics like this are sold as an investment more than anything else. The historical value of the book is still intact, and that's what people are actually buying when they buy a rare comic."" The legacy of Superman . These days, of course, quite a bit is online. Both Marvel and DC, the two major superhero purveyors, have parts of their websites devoted to accessing titles online, both free and for a fee. A number of sites specialize in posting comics old and new. Nevertheless, when it comes to historical work, Superman -- who will return to the movies next year with DC stablemate Batman -- still reigns supreme. And though the $3.2 million for the Metropolis/ComicConnect Action Comics No. 1 is the most anyone's paid for a comic book, Tosh believes there's a another copy out there somewhere, hidden carefully in somebody's collection. ""One of these days it'll turn up, and it will blow the rest of them out of the water,"" he said and then added words that even Superman would appreciate: ""The sky's the limit.""","The pristine $3.2 million Action Comics issue is available online .

"(CNN) -- Andy Murray will play Novak Djokovic in the quarterfinals of the Miami Masters after both men sailed through their last 16 matches. Murray, who won his second Miami title 12 months ago, beat France's Jo-Wilfried Tsonga while Djokovic beat Tommy Robredo of Spain. The Scot, who recently parted company with coach Ivan Lendl, put in a commanding performance against the 11th seed winning 6-4 6-1 in 74 minutes. Earlier, Djokovic progressed with a straight sets 6-3 7-5 win. The Serb, who is seeking a fourth Miami title, needed just over 80 minutes to see off 16th seed Robredo hitting 19 winners and five aces. The No. 2 seed was ruthless when required, taking both his break point opportunities -- one in each set -- to seal the win and remain on course for back-to-back ATP Tour 1000 events after winning at Indian Wells earlier this month. ""(It was a) very solid win,"" said Djokovic. ""I made him play an extra shot in important moments and that's why I'm satisfied with the overall match today."" Murray beat Djokovic in their previous meeting at last year's Wimbledon final, but has since slumped to sixth in the rankings. He has a home in Miami, where he is based for much of his training. ""If you're feeling a bit down, which I was a little bit when I got here, I also remember the amount of hours I put in on that tennis court out there and also in the gym,"" he said. ""This is where I have built most of my professional career from, so it makes a big difference coming back here. Mentally, I always feel pretty good here."" Roger Federer is also safely through to the last eight after dispatching Richard Gasquet in straight sets 6-1 6-2. But his compatriot Stanislas Wawrinka crashed out on Tuesday -- the latest victim of Ukraine's Alexandr Dolgopolov, who won in three sets 6-4 3-6 6-1. Federer will play Kei Nishikori in the quarters after the Japanese 20th seed overcame Spain's David Ferrer in an epic three-setter 7-6 (9/7) 6-2 7-6 (11/9). Nishikori raced into a 4-1 lead in the first before Ferrer clawed his way back into the set only to lose it on the tiebreak. But the Spanish fourth seed dominated the second before Nishikori won a grueling deciding set. Both players had match points in the tiebreak but it was Nishikori who eventually prevailed in three hours, seven minutes to send last year's losing finalist crashing out. World No. 1 Rafael Nadal, seeking his first Miami title after three losing finals, romped into the last eight with a 6-2 6-2 win over Italian 14th seed Fabio Fognini. The Spaniard will next face big-serving Canadian Milos Raonic, who booked his place by after beating Benjamin Becker of Germany 6-3 6-4. In the women's draw, Maria Sharapova is through to the semifinal after trouncing fellow former Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova 7-5 6-1. Sharapova, a losing finalist in Miami five times, will next face world No. 1 Serena Williams -- the American trounced ninth-ranked German Angelique Kerber 6-2 6-2. ""I felt much better today than in a few of my other matches here,"" said defending champion Williams, who has won a record six Miami titles. ""Knowing I was going to play a top-10 player, I knew I had to come out and play really well tonight. And I did play well."" Williams has won 14 successive matches against former No. 1 Sharapova, including the semifinals in Brisbane in January. ""I love playing her, I really do -- doesn't matter what surface or anything,"" the 32-year-old said. ""She's one of my favorite people to play. It just gets you really pumped."" Sharapova was also looking forward to the clash. ""It's no secret that she's been a big challenge of mine, an opponent that obviously I would love to beat,"" the Russian said. ""There are certainly ways I need to step up in certain situations I haven't been able to do in the past against her, but it's great I have the opportunity to play her again.""

"(CNN) -- Al-Jazeera broadcast on Thursday an audiotape on which a voice identified as Osama bin Laden declares ""Iraq is the perfect base to set up the jihad to liberate Palestine."" Terrorist leader Osama bin Laden spoke on a video released by al Qaeda in September. The voice calls on ""Muslims in neighboring countries"" to ""do their best in supporting their mujahedeen brothers in Iraq."" ""My speech to you is about the siege of Gaza and the way to liberate it,"" he said. ""The Gaza siege is a direct result of Annapolis,"" he adds, apparently referring to the site of November's summit in Annapolis, Maryland, where Israeli and Palestinian leadership agreed to work toward a two-state plan. He accused Arabs who supported the plan of having become ""partners in this horrendous crime."" And he predicted, ""Palestine will be restored to us, with God's permission, when we wake up from our slumber and adhere to our faith and sacrifice our souls and belongings for it."" The speaker called for armed revolt in the Middle East. ""Palestine and its people have been suffering from too much bitterness for almost a century now on the hands of the Christians and the Jews. And both parties didn't take Palestine from us by negotiations and dialogue, but with arms and fire, and this is the only way to take it back,"" he said. Though the voice sounds like bin Laden, CNN has not been able to confirm that it is him. However, a radical Islamist Web site reported earlier Wednesday that a statement from bin Laden was coming soon. The notice appeared on Al-Ekhlaas, known for carrying statements and videos from al Qaeda and its allies. Analysis of previous statements has indicated that bin Laden was the speaker, and a U.S. intelligence official said there was no reason to think the recorded voice was not bin Laden's. The broadcast comes a day after another statement attributed to the al Qaeda leader condemned European countries for siding with the United States in Afghanistan and for allowing the publication of cartoons considered insulting to Islam's prophet, Mohammed. ""This is the greater and more serious tragedy, and the reckoning for it will be more severe,"" the speaker in the five-minute audio recording says. The speaker said Muslims have not responded by mocking Jesus, whom they consider a prophet as well. ""The laws of men which clash with the legislation of Allah the Most High are null and void, aren't sacred and don't matter to us,"" he said. The speaker dismissed claims of free speech in his statement, citing European countries' laws against denying the existence of the Holocaust. Bin Laden also said in his earlier message that ""the crownless king in Riyadh"" -- Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah -- could have prevented the publication of the cartoons ""if it mattered to him."" ""If there is no check on the freedom of your words, then let your hearts be open to the freedom of our actions,"" he said. Bin Laden, who was behind the terrorist network's September 11 attacks, has been in hiding since the U.S. assault on Afghanistan that followed those strikes. His last public statement was an audio message issued in December, when he urged his followers in Iraq to continue battling U.S. troops there. Wednesday marked the fifth anniversary of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. The latest statement included no date reference beyond the cartoon controversy, which began in late 2005 when a Danish newspaper published a dozen cartoons about Islam, including one that depicted Mohammed wearing a turban resembling a bomb. Violent protests erupted in early 2006 after other European newspapers reprinted the images as a matter of free speech. Some Muslims believe it is forbidden by the Quran to show an image of the prophet at all, and others were offended that the cartoon by artist Kurt Westergaard appeared to depict Mohammed as a terrorist. Westergaard said he wanted his cartoon to say that some people exploited the prophet to legitimize terror. Several newspapers in Denmark reprinted the controversial cartoons in February after Danish authorities arrested several people who were said to be plotting a ""terror-related assassination"" of the cartoonist. That sparked violent protests in three Afghan cities this month, with Muslim students burning flags and chanting anti-Western statements. The message said the publication of the drawings in question ""came in the framework of a new crusade in which the Pope of the Vatican has played a large, lengthy role."" Pope Benedict is scheduled to visit the United States next month, with scheduled stops at the White House, the United Nations and Ground Zero, where the Twin Towers stood until al Qaeda's attack. Deputy Commissioner Paul J. Browne of the New York City Police Department said the department ""has been working closely with the United States Secret Service to provide the highest level of protection possible"" during the Pope's visit to New York.

"London, England (CNN) -- Two Norwegians were sentenced to death Thursday in Congo, the Norwegian Foreign Ministry said, after what a human rights group called a ""military show trial"" that relied on evidence obtained through torture. Joshua French, 28, who is also a British citizen, and Tjostolv Moland, 29, were convicted of murder, attempted murder, criminal conspiracy, armed robbery, and espionage, according to British legal charity Reprieve. Both men have maintained their innocence. Norway and Britain said Thursday they remain opposed to the death penalty and offered support to the men. The two men traveled into Congo from Uganda on a motorbike trip in April 2009, Reprieve said. When their bike broke down in Kisangani, they hired a car and a driver, and two Congolese passengers joined them, the group said. Several hours into the journey, in the middle of the rainforest, the driver was shot and killed, Reprieve said. Authorities allege French and Moland killed the driver, but both men maintain they were ambushed by gunmen. Afraid for their lives, they fled into the dense jungle, Reprieve said. They were arrested separately in May 2009, the group said. They were first sentenced to death last September. They lost their appeals but the Military High Court in Kinshasa quashed the sentences in April and sent the case back for a retrial, Reprieve reported. Reprieve said there is no physical evidence against the men and the two witnesses who testified against them were given large sums of money in compensation and have changed their stories ""countless"" times. The prosecution has also referred to statements obtained through torture, Reprieve said. ""This farce of a trial would be comical if the stakes weren't so tragically high,"" said Tineke Harris, the deputy death penalty director at Reprieve. ""Each time the military prosecution changes their theory, the witnesses all obligingly change their story."" Harris urged the British and Norwegian governments to press Congo to provide a ""credible civilian trial"" for French and Moland and arrange for their repatriation. A spokesman for the Norwegian Foreign Ministry told CNN the death sentences will not take effect until both men have exhausted their appeals. ""Norway is a strong opponent against the death penalty, and we have been communicating this stance to the relevant authorities,"" said spokesman Kjetil Elsebutangen. ""We have received assurances from the authorities that the death sentence won't be carried out and we hold the authorities responsible for the well being of these two."" Norway has told Congo it wants to transfer both men to Norway, but it's not clear under what conditions that can take place, Elsebutangen said. Britain's Foreign Office said it was ""extremely disappointed"" that French was sentenced to death. ""We will be doing everything we properly can to support him in the coming weeks and months,"" said a spokesman, who declined to be named in line with policy. ""We are committed to supporting any British national who faces the death penalty and our prime concern in this case is to ensure that no execution is carried out."" Britain has made its concerns clear to the Congolese government, the spokesman added. Reprieve said prosecution evidence includes photographs of two guns alleged to have been found on Moland's computer, but both guns have been traced to Norway and have never left Norway. The prosecution claims the maps, compass, and GPS system they were carrying proves they were spies, Reprieve said. After his arrest, French was beaten, subjected to a mock execution, and forced to sign a confession, the group said. The trial was held in French, a language neither man speaks, and no interpreter was provided for a large part of the trial, Reprieve said. ""For those hearings where an interpreter was present only a small part of what was said was translated, and even then mistakes were constantly made,"" the group said. ""French said that when he told the court he worked in security, the interpreter translated it as he worked as a spy."" Reprieve said the men are also being tried in military courts, in violation of Congo's constitution, which says such courts may only handle cases involving the military or police. Norwegian authorities deny that the two men, who are former soldiers, were ever involved in spying for Norway, Reprieve said.

"(CNN) -- Lauryn Hill walked free from a federal prison Friday and -- if she has her way -- back into the musical spotlight. The Grammy-winning artist was released from a low-security all-female facility in Danbury, Connecticut, according to federal prison records. She'd been incarcerated for the past three months for failing to pay federal income taxes. The 38-year-old still faces restrictions, though: three months of home confinement and a year of supervised probation. She'd also been ordered to pay penalties and the taxes she owed. Her lawyer, Nathan Hochman, said Hill has since fully paid her taxes. Hochman confirmed his client left the western Connecticut prison, as well as the fact she started her home confinement and probation on Friday. The singer got out several days earlier than planned due to various factors, ""including good behavior,"" Hochman said. On the same day of her release from prison, Hill released a new song called ""Consumerism"" -- a fast-moving track that puts the spotlight on various -isms, such as skepticism and narcissism -- via her official Tweeter feed. According to the linked page, ""she wanted to get this music out while she was incarcerated, as it is a product of the space she was in while she was going through some of the challenges she has been faced with recently."" The former Fugees star and solo artist has sold 16 million albums over the course of her career. But she didn't meet her tax obligations all that time: Hill pleaded guilty last year to three counts of failing to file tax returns on more than $1.8 million between 2005 and 2007. According to the prosecutor, the sentence she eventually faced also took ""into account additional income and tax losses for 2008 and 2009 -- when she also failed to file federal returns -- along with her outstanding tax liability to the state of New Jersey, for a total income of approximately $2.3 million and total tax loss of approximately $1,006,517."" Despite her commercial success, Hill told U.S. Magistrate Judge Madeline Cox Arleo in May that she lives ""very modestly"" and claimed that most of the money from her music went to other people. Describing her ""life of sacrifice with very little time for myself and my children,"" Hill insisted that she planned to pay her taxes, it was just a question of when. But, at her sentencing, the judge reminded the singer that individual citizens don't get to decide when they pay the government. The tax education of Lauryn Hill .

"(CNN) -- Norway's official  mourning period for victims of a bombing and shooting rampage ended Sunday with a national remembrance ceremony in Oslo. The Oslo bombing and Utoya island shooting killed a total of 77 people last month. ""In the time behind us, we have followed 77 people to their graves,"" King Harald V told mourners at Sunday's ceremony in Oslo. ""We have gotten to know each of them a little from the stories about them. Seventy-seven lives of people who wanted to change the world are gone. We will keep their memory alive by keeping their fight for a better world alive. I say to you as I said on the day after the tragedy -- freedom is stronger than fear."" The ceremony came a day after survivors returned for the first time to the site of the island shooting, where the gunman killed 69 people. He also bombed the Oslo government buildings on the same day, killing eight more people. Most of the victims were at a political summer camp held by  the youth wing of the governing Labour Party at the time of the July 22  shooting attack. Most survivors made it out alive by hiding among rocks or diving into the chilly waters around the island. Before the survivors' visit, relatives of those killed traveled to the island Friday for the first time to see where their loved ones spent their final moments. Many lit candles and left flowers in makeshift shrines. The suspect in both attacks, Anders Breivik, was ordered held in isolation for four more weeks Friday after appearing before a judge in Oslo. If removed from isolation, there's danger that he will tamper with evidence and hinder the police investigation, the judge said. Breivik, 32, had told the court that being held in isolation is ""boring, monotonous and a sadistic method of torture,"" the judge said. The suspect admitted the attacks, a judge and his lawyer say, but has pleaded not guilty in court. CNN's Cynthia Wamwayi contributed to this report.","NEW: ""We will keep their memory alive,"" says Norway's king .

"(CNN) -- Andy Murray's impressive defense of his Wimbledon title continued Monday as he dispatched 20th seed Kevin Anderson in straight sets in their fourth round match on Centre Court. It was always going to be a tall order for the 6 foot 8 inch South Africa to overcome the Scot who once again looked fit and focused in front of an expectant crowd. Murray engineered a break of serve in the third game of the match before serving out a competitive first set 6-4. Murray stormed into a 3-0 lead in the second before the heavens opened and the players left the court while the roof was closed. When they resumed, it was Anderson who began more brightly earning two break points on the Murray serve. He saved the first but could do nothing with the second as an Anderson pile driver took a heavy net cord with the Scot unable to get up to the ball. No bother. Murray was still a break up and in no mood to slip up again. Games went with serve up until the ninth when Anderson, serving to stay in the set, lost four points in succession to give Murray a two-set lead. Anderson's booming 130 mph-plus serve had delivered 63 aces in the first three rounds but he could only manage a further nine on Monday. The third set was tighter. Murray earned five break points in the eighth game but couldn't close out and with the chance gone the set went to a tiebreak. Like the set, it was nip and tuck with Anderson earning the first set point at 6-5 only for Murray to save it, win the next point and earn his first match point. Another competitive rally ended when Murray swiped a cross-court backhand winner and seal victory 6-4 6-3 7-6 (8/6). ""When it was outdoors, I played very well and was in a good position. When we came back indoors, he started to strike the ball a bit better, he started serving better,"" Murray said afterwards. ""It's a good win because he was playing well at the end and making it very tough for me. It's good to get through in straight sets."" The 11th seed Grigor Dimitrov awaits the world No. 5 in the quarterfinals. The Bulgarian, who won the Queen's Club event prior to Wimbledon, was also a straight sets winner defeating Argentina's Leonardo Mayer 6-4 7-6 (8/6) 6-2. No. 1 seed Novak Djokovic is also safely through to the last eight after negotiating a potentially tricky tie with France's Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. Djokokic won in straight sets with the almost identical scoreline to Murray, who he followed onto Centre Court. The Serb's 6-3 6-4 7-6 (7/5) victory -- his 13th in total over Tsonga -- puts him through to face Croatia's Marin Cilic who beat France's Jeremy Chardy 7-6 (10/8) 6-4 6-4. Bouchard bounds on . Eugenie Bouchard has already won one Wimbledon title -- now she's targeting the real deal. The 20-year-old Canadian, a junior champion at the All England Club in 2012, booked her place in the quarterfinals Monday following a straight sets win over France's Alize Cornet. Bouchard, who prevailed 7-6 7-5, will face either Maria Sharapova or Germany's Angelique Kerber for a place in the semifinals. The 13th seed has reached the last four of the previous two grand slams and is confident following her victory over Cornet, who had defeated World No.1 Serena Williams in the previous round. ""I'm really excited. I'm proud of the way I fought out there,"" Bouchard told the tournament's official website. ""Alize is a really great player. It was tough (under the roof), but it was the same for both of us. I need to focus on one match at a time, so that is my focus. This is what I've worked for, but I want to keep winning matches."" Elsewhere, Caroline Wozniacki's Wimbledon dream came to shuddering halt after she was dumped out in the fourth round Monday. The former World No.1 was beaten 6-2 7-5 by the Czech Republic's Barbora Zahlova Strycova, who qualified for her first ever grand slam quarterfinal. World No. 43 Strycova, who defeated Australian Open champion Li Na in the previous round, will now face either fellow Czech and 2011 champion Petra Kvitova for a place in the last four. ""Even when I had some opportunities I made some stupid mistakes or didn't play the balls properly. You know, it was kind of, I guess, one of those matches,"" Wozniacki, the Dane, seeded 16 at Wimbledon, told reporters. ""Of course I am a little disappointed sitting here. Obviously I would have loved to have been further. ""The fourth round has been the furthest I have got here, where I feel like I should have gone further some years, but, you know, I guess sometimes that happens. ""You just have to get yourself back up and keep working and come back next time."" Another Czech to reach the quarterfinals is Lucie Safarova who booked her place in the last eight following a comfortable 6-0 6-2 over compatriot Tereza Smitkova. Qualifier Smitkova, ranked 175th in the world, was dispatched in 48 minutes to set up a clash with either Agnieszka Radwanska or Ekaterina Makarova of Russia for a place in the last four. There was disappointment for Madison Keys, the final U.S. woman in the singles draw after she was forced to withdraw from her third round tie against Kazakhstan's Yaroslava Shvedova with injury. The 19-year-old, who won the Eastbourne tournament in the lead-up to Wimbledon, failed to recover from a thigh problem which she suffered on Saturday while trailing 6-7 6-6. ""I have a muscle strain in my abductor. It's not terrible, not really a long recovery time,"" Keys told reporters. ""But they were warning me it could get worse, make recovery time even longer."" Keys' injury means that Shvedova moves into the last 16 where she will play Germany's Sabine Lisicki. Lisicki, who reached the final last year, overcame Serbia's Ana Ivanovic 6-4 3-6 6-1. While rain prevented several matches from starting on time, there were some who managed to beat the clouds. In the men's draw, Australian Open champion Stanislas Wawrinka reached the fourth round for the first time since 2009 following a straight sets win over Uzbekistan's Denis Istomin. The Swiss ace, ranked fifth, eased to a 6-3 6-3 6-4 win to finish off the rain-affected match which had originally been scheduled for Saturday. Also into the fourth round is Japan's Kei Nishikori who overcame Italy's Simone Bolelli in a five-set thriller. The 10th seed triumphed 3-6 6-3 3-6 7-6 6-4 to make it through to the fourth round for the first time in his career. Nishikori's next opponent will be Canadian eighth seed Milos Raonic.","Andy Murray beats big serving Kevin Anderson to book quarterfinal against Dimitrov .

"(CNN) -- If there's one thing we can all agree on when it comes to ""Duck Dynasty"" star Phil Robertson and the fallout from his interview with GQ, it's that everyone has an opinion. And, to be honest, that's about the only thing we can agree on. In the 24 hours since GQ released its January profile of Robertson and his family, who draw millions to A&E with their reality show ""Duck Dynasty,"" social media has seen more than its typical overuse of exclamation points and excessive capitalization. The back-and-forth has gotten so extensive, we wouldn't be surprised if you've forgotten what you're even arguing about. But to be fair, this roiling debate is so addictive because the news here -- that Robertson shared viewpoints and beliefs that many, including A&E, found offensive, and was suspended indefinitely as a result -- gets to the heart of conversations many of us care about. This discussion may have been started with a single question: What does Phil Robertson, a professed born-again Christian, consider to be sinful? But it's now sprawled into even more complex territories like media responsibility and the difference -- if there is one -- between having an opinion and being a bigot. That last topic has been particularly difficult to tease out. Robertson told GQ that he considers homosexual behavior, among other things, to be sinful. To some, Robertson did nothing more than answer a question during an off-camera interview. Whether one agrees with his statement or not, it's been said, is not the point -- he shouldn't have been reprimanded for honestly answering a question. ""I'm gay and I don't care what others think, nor should other people. This guy did not offend me,"" Sue Dimaio posted on CNN's Facebook page. ""Some people have different beliefs, and I respect that. Let the guy stay on the show. There is something called free speech! Our freedom of speech is slowly being taken away from us, when it was once considered a huge part of the foundation of this country."" However, there are many others who read Robertson's words and saw the language of a bigot -- someone who treats members of a group with hatred and intolerance. In that view, his stance on homosexuality exceeds the boundaries of opinion or faith, and veers into discrimination. "" 'Is this man simply expressing his beliefs or spewing bigotry?' I don't see a distinction between the two,"" said another CNN.com commenter. ""Whatever the 'reasons' you have for being bigoted, at the end of the day, it's still bigotry. You can't hide behind 'it's my religious beliefs' as a justification for bad behavior."" And that's where we all get stuck: One man's idea of what constitutes an opinion -- or a spiritually prescribed value system -- is another man's idea of hateful rhetoric. This debate has even seeped into the political arena. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal issued a statement in defense of Robertson and his family, calling them ""great citizens of the State of Louisiana."" ""I don't agree with quite a bit of stuff I read in magazine interviews or see on TV. In fact, come to think of it, I find a good bit of it offensive,"" Jindal said. ""But I also acknowledge that this is a free country and everyone is entitled to express their views. In fact, I remember when TV networks believed in the First Amendment. It is a messed up situation when Miley Cyrus gets a laugh, and Phil Robertson gets suspended."" The counterpoint to Jindal's position? A&E has the right to act on their belief that Robertson was in the wrong. ""We are extremely disappointed to have read Phil Robertson's comments in GQ, which are based on his own personal beliefs and are not reflected in the series 'Duck Dynasty,' "" the network said in a statement Wednesday. ""His personal views in no way reflect those of A&E Networks, who have always been strong supporters and champions of the LGBT community. The network has placed Phil under hiatus from filming indefinitely."" To many CNN.com commenters, including one with the intriguing handle ""trollmuch,"" Robertson's freedom of speech hasn't been infringed upon: ""He has a right to speak his mind, but A&E has the right to take action."" One voice that hasn't been heard from as much in this debate is that of the GQ profile's writer, Drew Magary. While the magazine isn't offering further comment on what's transpired, it did point CNN toward Magary's reflection and outtakes from the article posted on Deadspin.com. The writer explains there that while he doesn't agree with Robertson's politics, he also isn't calling for the man's head. ""Whenever you meet face-to-face with people you don't necessarily see eye-to-eye with and talk to them and drink lots of beer with them, you're almost always more likely to understand them and like them. That's how it works,"" Magary writes. ""I don't agree with Phil's politics, and I have a lot of gay relatives and colleagues who would bristle at Phil's 'hate the sin, love the sinner' view of homosexuality. ... But I still like Phil and found him to be an otherwise decent fellow. I think it's all right to think that, and I think it's all right to hope that whatever fuss arises out of his comments -- it's happening already -- will soften him a bit toward what he believes to be wicked behavior. Consider this my own version of 'hate the sin, love the sinner.' "" A perspective which, we can all agree, is bound to elicit more opinions.","The fallout over Phil Robertson being suspended from ""Duck Dynasty"" has been immense .
It's expanded into a critical discussion about faith, freedom of speech and bigotry .
On one side, some think Robertson shouldn't be reprimanded for answering a question .
On the other, there's the argument that bigotry shouldn't be protected ."
"(CNN) -- As it deals with fallout from its bankruptcy announcement, American Airlines is also facing the wrath of a family who claim their loved one died after eating a meal served by the carrier. The wife and daughter of the late Othon Cortes of Miami are suing the airline and Sky Chefs for more than $1 million, alleging he ate food contaminated with bacteria during a flight from Barcelona, Spain, to New York. The incident happened on May 18 after Cortes consumed an in-flight meal that allegedly contained chicken, according to a lawsuit filed last week in the U.S. District Court in Miami. As is typical for active lawsuits, American Airlines declined to comment about the complaint or its allegations, said Tim Smith, a spokesman for the carrier. Meanwhile, LSG Sky Chefs -- a German company that produces airline meals for more than 300 airlines -- has begun the process to dismiss the case, said spokeswoman Josefine Corsten. ""Based upon the allegations in the complaint it is not possible that Sky Chefs is the responsible party because we did not cater the Barcelona flight in question,"" she said. The lawsuit states that after the plane landed at John F. Kennedy International Airport and as Cortes and his wife waited for their next flight to Miami, Cortes felt ""discomfort and pain that included sharp stomach cramps and sudden thirst and other clear outward manifestation of severe physical illness."" During the flight to Miami, Cortes experienced nausea and shortness of breath, and became unresponsive after a cardiac event, forcing the plane to make an emergency landing in Norfolk, Virginia, his wife and daughter said. He was pronounced dead on arrival. Cortes' family alleges that his death was caused by poisoned food that American Airlines and Sky Chefs served on the international flight. It accuses the companies of ""failing to properly maintain or prepare the food"" and alleges the companies allowed the food to become contaminated with Clostridium perfringens bacteria. Perfringens poisoning is one of the most commonly reported foodborne illnesses in the U.S., according to the FDA. It is very rarely fatal, but a few deaths have been reported as a result of dehydration and other complications, the agency said.","Family of Othon Cortes sues American Airlines and Sky Chefs .

"(CNN) -- Switzerland's Massimo Busacca has been selected to referee Wednesday's Champions League final between Barcelona and Manchester United in Rome on Wednesday -- UEFA have confirmed on their official Web site UEFA.com . Massimo Busacca refereed the 2007 UEFA Cup and one of the semifinals from Euro 2008. Busacca, 40, will be assisted by his compatriots Matthias Arnet and Francesco Buragina, while the fourth official will be Claudio Circhetta. Busacca has been an international referee since 1999 and has taken charge of 32 Champions League matches, including six this season. Among the top club matches he has overseen are this year's Champions League quarterfinal second leg between Porto and Manchester United and the 2007 UEFA Cup final between Sevilla and Espanyol in Glasgow. On the international stage, Busacca was also in charge of the Euro 2008 semifinal between Germany and Turkey and the 2006 World Cup last 16 match between Argentina and Mexico. Meanwhile, authorities in Rome have enforced a blanket ban on the sale of alcohol as they attempt to stave off the threat of trouble between 67,000 Barcelona and Manchester United fans. In a bid to avoid incidents, local authorities have banned the sale of alcohol throughout the city and in airports and stations from 11pm on Tuesday until 6am on Thursday morning.

"(CNN) -- There was barely time for the pea to stop spinning as the final whistle blew on the Premier League season before club owners started the next phase of their insatiable quest for improved fortunes. West Bromwich Albion took less than 24 hours to dispense with the services of Spanish coach Pepe Mel, while Tottenham Hotspur managed to wait just a little longer before sacking Tim Sherwood. The dismissals take the number of Premier League managers sacked in the course of the 2013-2014 season to 12, with West Ham manager Sam Allardyce also in danger of losing his job. Tuesday was also the day when many expected Louis van Gaal to give a concrete update on his chances of joining Manchester United, but the man who will step down as Netherlands coach after the forthcoming World Cup was non-committal. ""I'm here as Dutch national team coach, not the future Manchester United coach,"" Van Gaal told reporters at the training camp in Hoenderloo, before refusing to be drawn further on the subject. The Dutchman has been widely tipped to take charge at Old Trafford, after a tumultuous season in which Ryan Giggs finished as interim manager following the dismissal of David Moyes. Even though Sherwood left White Hart Lane with the best win percentage (59%) of any Spurs manager in the Premier League, he paid the price for failing to keep his emotions in check and to take Spurs into the Champions League. Andre Villas-Boas was manager for the first half of the season so Sherwood cannot take all the blame yet he did finish the season 10 points off the Champions League places, having taken charge when the gap was half that tally. ""We appointed Tim mid-season as someone who knew both the players and the club,"" said Tottenham owner Daniel Levy in a statement. ""We agreed an 18-month contract with a break clause at the end of the season and we have now exercised that option."" Overseeing Sunday's 3-0 defeat of Aston Villa, which enabled Spurs to finish sixth, Sherwood did at least ensure a fourth consecutive season of Europa League football, worth around $14 million to the club. That falls short of the Champions League football that owner Daniel Levy so desperately wants to see, both for its prestige and riches. In addition to the $42 million guaranteed by television money, clubs can also profit by squeezing every last ounce out of their commercial partners given the greater exposure afforded by being part of European football's greatest club competition. Southampton manager Mauricio Pochettino is favorite to replace Sherwood and if the Argentine can lift the Saints to eighth, can he be the man to take Spurs back to the Champions League for the first time since 2010/11? Such a return would be particularly welcome, especially with the new television deal guaranteeing English clubs at least $67 million when it comes into play for the 2015/16 season. While such sums seem suitably seductive, they are not far off the amount that clubs earn just by staying in the Premier League. Take West Brom's neighbors and rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers, who were pulling in the Premier League pay packed until their relegation in 2012. During the 2011-12 season, the club made a profit of $9.7 million but one year later, they had lost $50 million -- a figure that would have been worse had it not been for the first parachute payment ($27m of $81m) that clubs receive after relegation from the Premier League. It's a reminder to West Brom, who finished the season just one place above the relegation zone, of the importance of getting their next appointment right, following a season in which both Mel and predecessor Steve Clarke were pushed out.","Tottenham Hotspur dismiss manager Tim Sherwood .

"(CNN) -- Internet activists, perhaps today's new generation of hippies, often chant the mantra that ""information wants to be free."" The New York Times may have silenced some of them on Thursday. The venerable news outlet announced that 100,000 people had signed up for digital subscriptions in the first month since they were offered. The Times erected a pay wall on its site March 28, forcing readers to subscribe if they wanted to click on more than 20 articles per month. The digital plans range from $15 to $35 for four weeks of access, depending on which device you want to read the articles on. An early promotion let subscribers pay 99 cents per week. So, 100,000 new digital subscriptions in four weeks for the nation's third-largest newspaper -- is that an impressive figure? ""If you're The New York Times, no,"" said Alex Daley, an analyst for Casey Research. ""The New York Times is the Apple of the journalism world,"" he added. Daley believes that Web-only subscription rate could be hard for the Times to sustain and grow. ""There's no virtuous cycle in a subscription business like this,"" he said. ""Over time, the sales are actually going to get harder than easier."" By June 30, the Times will start giving Apple 30% of revenue from users who sign up for a subscription via its app on the iPhone or iPad, said Eileen Murphy, a spokeswoman for the news organization. As of last month, the Times' app for Apple devices had been downloaded 7.8 million times, she said. ""Apple creates innovative products that our readers love, and it is important for us to make the Times available on those platforms where our readers want us to be,"" she wrote in an e-mail. Let's crunch a few numbers: Apple sold 4.69 million iPads in the last three months -- ""every iPad 2 we were able to make,"" Peter Oppenheimer, the financial chief said -- versus the Times's 100,000 digital plans. The Times' Web-only subscription base ""should be in the millions, but it's going to take them time to get there,"" Daley said. ""It's an adjustment for their customers. It's an adjustment for their business."" The Times' financial health, like that of many print-centric media companies, is less than stellar. The company's profits  fell sharply over the last few months due to a struggling advertising market. ""You have a business still whose core revenue model is changing dramatically,"" Daley said. ""You're talking about a company that is half advertising-based, half subscription-based."" The newspaper's circulation and its subscription revenue have fallen while newsprint costs have risen. That's despite online postings from a few outspoken cost crunchers who discovered that it's cheaper in some cases to subscribe to the paper's Sunday print edition, which comes with free digital access, than to buy a digital-only plan.","The New York Times added 100,000 digital-only subscribers in the past month .

"(CNN) -- I don't know what's more offensive: rancher Cliven Bundy telling blacks they'd be better off as slaves picking cotton or conservatives who continue to defend him. Not only were his comments racist, but under no stretch of the imagination could anyone argue blacks were better off during slavery with no rights, working for free and being held the property of white people. I tweeted my outrage at Bundy's remarks, who by the way is a Republican, and to my surprise many of my followers excused his behavior, tweeting things like: . ""I don't think he's a racist. Just old school."" More like Cliven Bundy is ""an old school racist"" is what I responded. Others tweeted things like I ""needed to go back and watch the clip with an open mind."" Or that ""the Cliven issue is about Federal overreach please don't follow libs and make it about race."" I've watched the clip many times with a very open mind and each time I come to the same conclusion: Bundy is a racist. If slavery was such a great institution and better than being on welfare, as Bundy declared, why doesn't Bundy go back in time, become a slave and pick cotton for plantation owners without getting paid? He needs a history lesson about the horrors of slavery and why ""we blacks"" no longer call ourselves Negros. I'm glad to see many conservatives swiftly condemned Bundy's comments. But the real insult to injury for me as a black conservative woman is they never should have embraced him in the first place. Conservatives are supposed to be the party that believes in adhering to the Constitution and the laws of our land. We talk about this to the point of obsession, myself included, with regard to issues like immigration, affirmative action, Obamacare, etc. Yet conservatives of all kinds couldn't wait to support Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, who for over 20 years has refused to follow the laws of our land and Constitution by not paying over $1 million in grazing fees to the Bureau of Land Management. CNN's Chris Cuomo pointed this out to Bundy in his interview Friday, reminding him that he might want to read the Constitution he carries in his pocket. The federal government owns 85% of Nevada's land. In other western states the federal government also owns large swaths of land. Is it government overreach? Sure. But the way to tackle that government overreach is -- as members of Congress, conservative media personalities and others know very well -- to introduce legislation to fix it. One doesn't just wake up one morning like Cliven Bundy did and decided he's not going to follow the laws of our land. There are lots of laws I don't like -- most notably paying taxes -- but I follow them because I don't want to go to jail. As BLM rangers tried to confiscate Bundy's 500 cattle for his disobeying the law, Bundy joined about 50 other supporters, many of whom were armed with guns and refused to yield. And conservatives like Sean Hannity and Sen. Rand Paul cheered him on in his defiance. Then Bundy reveals himself as a racist. The entire Bundy affair just makes the Republican Party look bad. Are all Republicans racist? Absolutely not. But many overwhelming came out in support of this lunatic. I think it's an awful day for conservatives. I think we need serious reflection because we're not going to win 2016 with this attitude, keep doing things the same old way. We have old white men saying offensive things to women and minorities, and I'm tired of it. At a time when the GOP needs to bring more minorities into our tent -- along with women for that matter -- embracing fools like Bundy doesn't help and certainly will put us farther down the path of losing in 2016. I've said it over the past five years, but it continues to fall on deaf ears: The Republican Party at all levels from political organizations to offices of members of Congress needs to do a better job hiring blacks. Not to do ""black or minority outreach"" but to do the same jobs your white staffers are doing. Maybe if the GOP would stop treating blacks as ""others"" and really give us a seat at the table, it would stop acting like the stupid party and start winning presidential elections again.

"(CNN) -- Argentina's Congress debated a broadcast reform bill Wednesday, a proposal analysts say is the latest blow in a fight between President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner and media conglomerate Grupo Clarin. Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has blamed Grupo Clarin for her low approval ratings. The goal of the so-called Audio-Visual Communication law is to regulate television and radio broadcasters, and increase competition in the media industry, according to a draft of the bill. Analysts say the bill could be approved by the lower Chamber of Congress as early as Thursday after Fernandez de Kirchner withdrew a contentious article that would have allowed telecom companies to enter the broadcast industry. The media law calls for the creation of a regulatory agency and spells out ownership rules regarding how many and what kind of outlets one company can hold. This bill is ""for everyone who wants to live in a more democratic and more pluralistic Argentina,"" Fernandez de Kirchner said in a speech last month. But critics said it targets the powerful Grupo Clarin. The newspaper Clarin has been highly critical of the leadership of Fernandez de Kirchner and her husband and predecessor, Nestor Kirchner. Although the proposed legislation would not affect newspapers, Grupo Clarin's other business interests in cable, television and radio would be forced to be sold off or restructured. ""[Cristina] Kirchner saw [Clarin] as a limit to her power, and this was the origin of the conflict,"" Argentine political analyst Rosendo Fraga said. Argentina's case is just one of a number of fights between the presidency and the media in Latin America. ""At this moment, in Nicaragua, Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador and Argentina, the presidents have conflicts with the private media and seek to dominate them, although each country is a different case,"" Fraga said. Among the changes proposed in the bill, a company that owns a cable business would not be allowed to own any over-the-air broadcast channels. Also, the owner of a cable company would be allowed to have only one channel on that system. In its current form, Grupo Clarin would be in violation of both limits, among others. ""It hits other media groups, but Clarin is the one it hurts,"" said Daniel Kerner, an analyst at Eurasia Group. The reform would also redistribute broadcast frequencies into thirds: one-third for private media, one-third for the government and one-third for nongovernmental organizations and other civil groups. ""More control of the media by the government, this is the main motivation,"" Kerner said. Journalism advocacy groups have raised concerns, focusing on a proposed requirement that broadcasters renew licenses every two years. ""We are extremely concerned at the opportunity created under the current draft legislation for political pressure on broadcasters,"" International Press Institute Director David Dadge said in a statement. ""We urge Argentinean legislators not to pass this bill in its current form."" If anyone is applying unfair pressure, it is monopolistic media companies, Fernandez de Kirchner said. ""Freedom of expression cannot turn into freedom of extortion,"" she said during an August 27 speech. ""The right to information means the right to all information, not to the concealment of part of the information and the distortion and manipulation of the other part."" Grupo Clarin has about two-thirds of the cable market in Argentina, but its other products don't come close to monopolistic figures, Fraga said. Both Kirchners have blamed Clarin's critical reports for their low approval ratings. The ruling party was dealt a strong defeat during recent midterm elections. In response, Fernandez de Kirchner has come out swinging at the Clarin newspaper and its parent company, observers said. Last month, the government pushed the nation's soccer association to rescind a contract it had with Clarin to broadcast games. The government reached into its coffers and offered the association double what Clarin was paying for rights to broadcast the games. This month, 200 tax agents made a surprise raid on the newspaper's offices, ostensibly to check employment records, editor Ricardo Kirschbaum said.

"Mexico City (CNN) -- A suspected leader of the Juarez drug cartel told authorities he had ordered the deaths of about 1,500 people, a Mexican federal police official said Sunday. Federal police detailed accusations against Jose Antonio Acosta Hernandez, known as ""El Diego,"" a day after authorities announced his capture. He was one of the country's most wanted criminals, with officials offering a reward of 15 million pesos ($1.3 million) for his arrest. Collaboration with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration led to Acosta's detention, said Eduardo Pequeno, head of the Mexican federal police anti-drug unit. Acosta is accused of being a leader of the drug gang known as La Linea, the enforcement arm of the Juarez cartel, Mexican authorities have said. Pequeno told reporters that Acosta ""said he ordered the killings of about 1,500 people, mostly in Ciudad Juarez and Chihuahua's capital."" An investigation points to Acosta as the mastermind behind the March 2010 killing of three people connected with the U.S. Consulate in Juarez, Pequeno said. More recently, Acosta ordered operatives to hang banners with threatening messages directed at the DEA and other U.S. authorities, Pequeno said. Juarez, Mexico's most violent city, shares a border with El Paso, Texas. Pequeno also accused Acosta of having connections with some of the border city's most notorious violence over the past two years, including the 2010 killing of a state prosecutor, a car bombing outside a police station and a massacre at a house party that killed 15 people -- most of them students with no ties to organized crime. Acosta told authorities the targets of his criminal organization included police, government officials, rival drug gangs and civilians, Pequeno told reporters. Earlier this month, the U.S. consulate in Juarez issued a statement warning ""American citizens to remain vigilant"" based on information it had received that cartels may target the consulate or entry points on the U.S.-Mexico border. The northwestern Mexican state of Chihuahua, which contains the namesake capital city as well as Juarez, has been a hotbed for drug-related violence. The federal government has been targeting cartels' operations, and especially its leaders, in an ongoing battle. Mexican authorities have arrested several others they accuse of being connected to the slayings of three people connected with the consulate last year. The shootings occurred March 13, 2010, when consulate employee Lesley Enriquez and her husband, Arthur Redelfs, were gunned down as they left a birthday party in their white SUV. Jorge Alberto Salcido Ceniceros, the husband of another consulate employee, was killed in a separate vehicle.","Police: Jose Antonio Acosta Hernandez says he targeted police, officials, rivals .

"(CNN) -- What's better than receiving a text message? How about a text in 3-D? That's the potential of a smartphone from LG, which has a large 4.3-inch touchscreen capable of displaying three-dimensional images without the need for special glasses. A pair of cameras on the back allows users to take 3-D photographs and videos. LG is hoping its groundbreaking phone, with the hottest entertainment-focused technology on the market, will ride the 3-D wave being pushed by Hollywood, TV networks and other creators of media content. The method LG uses to accomplish this effect is called ""switchable barrier,"" which is similar to how Nintendo's 3DS can do 3-D without requiring the player to wear glasses. LG showed the phone, called the Optimus 3D, this week at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain. The company didn't provide a release date or price, though spokespeople have said it will be affordable. Demonstration units on display at the conference let attendees watch 3-D movies. They also provided a few 3-D games to play. That could pose a threat to the temporary monopoly Nintendo was poised to get on portable 3-D gaming when its handheld game system launches in March. With the proliferation of 3-D TVs in the market, the Optimus 3D could help people begin shooting and archiving cutting-edge family pictures and home videos. The phone can hook up to a 3-D TV with a cable to display media on the big screen. LG's G-Slate, a tablet that runs Google's Android 3.0 software and is slated for a March release, can also capture 3-D pictures and video. The tablet can't display 3-D on its screen, but like the phone, the G-Slate can be connected to a 3-D TV set. The Optimus 3D has caused quite a stir this week at Mobile World Congress. However, so far it offers no spinning 3-D text messages or eye-popping dial pads, meaning Android app developers have a new mission to fulfill.","LG's Optimus 3D can show 3-D images without the need for special glasses .

"(CNN) -- A man accused of shooting two soldiers at a military recruiting center in 2009 pleaded guilty Monday to the crime and received a sentence of life in prison without parole. Abdulhakim Muhammad, formerly known as Carlos Bledsoe, was charged with killing Pvt. William Long, 23, and wounding Pvt. Quinton Ezeagwula, 18. The attack happened June 1, 2009, outside a recruiting center in Little Rock, Arkansas. Muhammad faced 12 charges in total -- capital murder, attempted capital murder and 10 counts of unlawful discharge of a firearm from a vehicle -- according to Stephanie Harris, a spokeswoman with the state court system. In Arkansas, defendants cannot plead guilty in a case in which the death penalty is a possibility. Prosecutors agreed to drop the death penalty in exchange for Muhammad's plea, Harris said. A Muslim convert from Memphis, Tennessee, Muhammad was 23 at the time of the fatal shooting. He was angry at the U.S. military because of ""what they had done to Muslims in the past,"" Little Rock homicide Detective Tommy Hudson has said. CNN's Sara Pratley contributed to this report.","Abdulhakim Muhammad pleads guilty to a fatal attack at a Little Rock military center .

"Western Region, Abu Dhabi (CNN) -- A dusty track in the remote western region of the United Arab Emirates is one of the last places you'd expect to find a beauty pageant. But the leggy, doe-eyed lovelies on parade here are of the four-legged variety. The Al-Dhafra Camel Festival is a celebration of the ancient bond between humans and the ""ships of the desert,"" which have traditionally provided Bedouins with food, clothing and transportation. The highlight of the event, which draws more than 1,500 camel owners and 25,000 camels from all over the Arabian Peninsula to Al-Dhafra, about 150km west of Abu Dhabi, is the camel beauty contest. The judges in this high-stakes contest rate the animals -- the females of which are considered better looking -- on criteria including firmness of ear, straightness of leg and the size of their toe cleft. ""The big size of the bones, the big foot, the height of the camel, the neck,"" explains Shakhboot Al-Dosari, one of the judges, listing the most desirable attributes. ""The smoother the neck the better, the longer the neck the better."" It's a job he takes seriously, as the spoils of victory can be significant. The festival is an important auction market for purebred camels, and as well as commanding high prices, award-winning specimens can confer immense prestige on their owners. Read also: Stopping sexual assault in Cairo's Tahrir Square . Nasser Al-Hajri, a wealthy Saudi oil contractor who has been a devoted collector of the animals for the past decade, is prepared to pay top dollar for the right camel. ""It's a competition between tribes,"" he explains of the hump-backed status symbols. ""I want... the best camel to be owned by me."" He paid nearly $2.5 million for four-year-old Gaooda, voted one of the most beautiful. ""I love it. It is number one here, it is not number two,"" he says. The festival's organizers say it is an important way to protect the purebred camel lines of the region -- the light-skinned asayal, and the darker brown majaheem. More broadly, explains festival director Salem Al Mazrouei, it is also a way of preserving aspects of Bedouin cultural heritage that might otherwise be lost in a rapidly modernizing country. Read also: Can Iraq's geeks save the country? According to the rules laid down in the festival program, owners are required to swear religious oaths that the stated age and lineage of their animals is correct. As well as the beauty contest and auctions, the festival also has contests in traditional pursuits such as camel racing, camel milking, falconry and date packaging. There is also racing of purebred Arabian salukis, the slender sight-hound that is one of the world's most ancient breeds of domesticated dog, as well as handicrafts displays. While the SUV has replaced the camel as a means of transportation in the modern Emirates, it's clear the animal retains an important place in the nation's heart. ""The camels helped our grandparents in the past,"" says Al Mazrouei. ""Nowadays, we would like to give back to the camels and to absorb our culture.""","The Al-Dhafra Camel Festival features a beauty contest for purebred camels .

"(CNN) -- Bullets riddled a crowd at an Alabama nightclub over the weekend, according to police. Rapper Doe B, 22, was killed, police said. So was Kimberle Johnson, 21. The barrage wounded six more people at the Centennial Hill Bar and Grill in Montgomery early Saturday. Security guards at the club couldn't stop the shooting. Police are searching for suspects and asking for tips on Facebook to help them make arrests. The mayor vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice. Doe B and gunshot wounds . Doe B was born Glenn Thomas, and is from Montgomery, his manager Frank White said. Thomas had recently been on tour. Colorful placards announcing his performances marked the path of his December concert rounds through his state and to Atlanta. He then returned to the club in his home town, where his life was taken. It was not the first time he had been shot, Billboard Magazine reported. His eye was wounded in a previous shooting, and he wore an eye patch that had become his trademark. On the cover of his new album Baby Jesus, a baby is pictured dressed like Doe B with the eye patch and with additional bullet wounds on the left arm. Tough turf . The venue got a reputation with city officials after a shooting there last year, which local media reported. Back then it was called the Rose Supper Club, but it changed its name after the violence. Some people vented their rage at the club over Doe B's killing Saturday in all caps on the venue's old, pre-name-change Facebook page. ""Y'all SHOULD BE CHARGED WITH MURDER,"" wrote Brandon King. Montgomery's mayor shut the club down. The city had given Centennial Hill repeated warnings, Todd Strange said in a statement. ""I believe it is not a matter of 'if,' but 'when' the next tragic incident occurs at this business,"" he said. ""That is unacceptable, and that is why we have ordered the business to be closed effective immediately."" Music of sorrow . Doe B's musician friends and compatriots poured out their hearts on Twitter. ""He was just getting started.... The future was so bright... I would have told you thank you. Rest in peace,"" manager White posted. ""Clubs keep lettin guns in the club as if that's not where we as artists work.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- House Democrats' push on health care legislation hit a snag Thursday when a group of fiscally conservative Democrats, known as ""Blue Dogs,"" put on the brakes, pressing the Democratic leadership for significant changes to the draft bill. Rep. Mike Ross, D-Arkansas, is a leading negotiator for the Blue Dog Coalition on health care. As the Democratic leaders worked feverishly to finalize details of the legislation for a planned Friday rollout, the Blue Dog Coalition sent a letter late Thursday night saying the bill ""lacks a number of elements essential to preserving what works and fixing what is broken."" Forty of the group's 52 members of the group signed the letter, making it clear that a major block of the House Democratic caucus wanted some concessions in order to get their votes. Shortly after the letter's release, a group of the Blue Dogs huddled in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office with other leaders for nearly two hours. Arkansas Democratic Congressman Mike Ross, a leading negotiator for the Blue Dogs on health care, told reporters he, Rep. John Tanner, D-Tennessee, and Rep. Allen Boyd, D-Florida, also met with White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel on Wednesday to go over their concerns. ""The message to him was the same as to the leadership -- that we could not support the current bill,"" Ross said. Boyd told CNN that no deals were struck Thursday night, but that the group agreed to meet with House Energy and Commerce Chairman Henry Waxman, Ways and Means Chairman Charlie Rangel and Education and Labor Committee Chairman George Miller, on Friday. Boyd and other members representing rural areas pushed leaders to adjust the rates that rural doctors and hospitals are paid by Medicare for health care services. ""From a practical standpoint in terms of a timeline, a bill doesn't come into the House chamber until you got the votes to pass it, and I don't think they have the votes to pass it at this point. We've got to try to get to point where we're comfortable,"" Boyd said. Pelosi repeated her pledge earlier Thursday that a government run health care plan would be included in the House bill. Ross said conservative Democrats have major reservations about how a public option would work. In the letter and in the meeting, the conservative Democrats stressed they did not want a ""Medicare-like"" structure for a public option. ""What we are saying is if there is a public option, it can't be based on Medicare rates unless the regional disparity in Medicare rates is fixed,"" said Ross, who also planned to press for more controls on government spending on healthcare and more savings from changes to Medicare. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer waved off any suggestions that the development Thursday night was a setback. ""Let me make it very clear that everybody in that room thinks we ought to pass health care,"" Hoyer said. But he also acknowledged that they still need to work through the details.","Conservatives press Democratic leadership for significant changes to draft bill .

"(CNN) -- His Garmin-Sharp teammate saw victory snatched from his grasp in heartbreaking fashion earlier in the Tour de France but Ramunas Navardauskas made sure there was to be no repeat on a rain soaked 19th stage Friday. Navardauskas took his courage in his hands to burst clear of the peloton with 13km of the leg from Maubourguet Pays du Val d'Adour to Bergerac and to stay clear, becoming the first Lithuanian to win a stage of cycling's most prestigious race. The 26-year-old was helped by a late crash which disrupted the efforts of the chasing teams with recognized sprinters and left green jersey leader Peter Sagan on the tarmac. Yellow jersey holder Vincenzo Nibali avoided the carnage to maintain his seven minute 10 second advantage over Thibaut Pinot of France in the overall classification with just two days to go. It was the first stage win of the 2014 Tour for Garmin-Sharp, who might have thought their luck was out after Jack Bauer's tearful failure in Nimes last Sunday. Bauer had led until the closing meters before being overhauled by a pack of surging sprinters, but if Navardauskas was unnerved by that precedent he did not show it as he attacked on the fourth category Cote de Monbazillac. Using his noted ability as a time trialist, Navardauskas' advantage stayed at around 20 seconds until the crash at the front of the peloton just inside the three kilometers to go mark. His teammate Bauer took a hefty fall in the incident, the unfortunate New Zealander receiving medical attention at the roadside before cycling to the finish. Navardauskas could afford to sit up to celebrate his victory, having a seven second advantage over the chasers, who were led by German John Degenkolb ahead of two-time stage winner Alexander Kristoff of Norway in third. But he revealed that fear of the same fate befalling him as Bauer had been his motivation. ""I didn't know what was happening back there,"" he told gathered reporters. ""I was thinking that maybe the sprinters' teams would chase me down. ""I've no idea what happened, I just went as fast as I can, I kept my speed up and hoped that what happened to Jack wouldn't happen to me. ""Until the last 10 meters I was afraid to turn back. I went as fast as I can so at the end I couldn't say that I could have done better. I went with all my power and at the end I had nothing left in my legs."" Saturday will see the final major test of an eventful Tour, a 54km individual time trial from Bergerac to Perigueux. Nibali's advantage leaves him in a comfortable position, but the real battle will be for the other podium places with Pinot, fellow Frenchman Jean Christophe Peraud and fourth-placed Alejandro Valverde of Spain separated by just 15 seconds. Sprint specialists such as Marcel Kittel, Kristoff and Sagan will get one final chance of a stage win with the traditional finale on the Champs Elysees in Paris Sunday with Nibali set to be crowned Tour de France champion for the first time barring disasters.","Ramunas Navardauskas wins 19th stage of Tour de France .

"(CNN) -- Hilary Lister had had the difficult conversation with her husband -- a few times in fact. The quadriplegic had finally made the decision to end her life, had prepared to say goodbyes to Clifford and the rest of her family. ""It got to a point where I evaluated my life,"" Lister told CNN. ""I had to decide whether the space that I take up on the sofa [which unable to move she had done for hours and days on end] was still worth inhabiting. ""I came to the conclusion it wasn't. I was at a very, very low point. ""I knew if and when my condition got any worse I would end my life. That was a decision myself and my husband were both aware of. You don't make that decision on your own, you have to prepare yourself."" It was to be a pre-ordained death with rules. ""Basically, I wouldn't allow myself to take my tablets any more if I got much worse or got depressed or whatever,"" Lister added. ""But I also set parameters to make sure that it wasn't a spur of the moment thing. I have wonderful friends and family, who made sure they did everything to make sure my life was worth living."" For all their collective positivity, though, nothing worked, until a friend lured Lister to an outing on the water at Westbere Sailing Club, her local club in southern England. ""It wouldn't overstate it to say that sailing saved my life,"" said Lister. ""It just gave me a little glimmer of thinking that space I was taking up on the sofa was worth inhabiting after all, particularly as someone had managed to get me off it to get on the water. ""It was like 'gosh, I've found a reason to live.'"" That was 11 years ago. Since that Damascene conversion she has sailed single handed across the English Channel, circumnavigated Great Britain and most recently sailed the 1,500 kilometers across the Arabian Sea from Mumbai to Muscat, her first proper offshore expedition. It made her the first paralyzed women to complete the voyage while also on board was Omani yachtswoman Nashwa Al Kindi, the first Arab woman to complete the trip. Muscle waiting disease . Lister suffers from reflex sympathetic dystrophy, a muscle wasting disease caused by a genetic blip that now prevents her from using her arms and legs. With her sole movement in her head, Lister's boat for that voyage -- a 28-ft Dragonfly trimaran -- was rigged up for her to sail it using innovative methods originally designed in the United States. ""I have three straws with which you register positive or negative pressure - so puff or suck,"" she explains. ""That turns the winch one way or the other. The magic thing on the latest trip is that I was able to turn port and starboard in opposite directions at the same time thanks to reversible winches and thus fully tack the boat rather than doing it slowly, slowly bit by bit."" The 41-year-old hasn't always lacked mobility and it wasn't until the age of 11 that she noticed there might be something awry. ""I came off the hockey pitch with really sore knees,"" she recalls. ""I thought it was growing pains and would go away. By 13, it was hurting walking up and down stairs but again I thought it would go away."" It didn't. By the age of 17, she had lost the use of her legs, though she refused to give up on her ambition to become a biochemist -- an ambition she says she had from the age of three, which she achieved with a university degree followed by a PhD. Working in a lab on her PhD she had to concentrate on not dropping things. One day, though, three months of work and £12,000 worth of samples slipped out of her hands. She never returned to the lab and a complex operation, which involved blood drained from her arms with an injection to stun painful nerve ends, did not work. ""Life isn't always straightforward,"" reflects Lister. ""You just have to be grateful for what you have when you have it."" For her, that is out on the water. ""It's such a liberating place, it's where you feel free. Once on the boat I can sail it as well as anyone really. I can forget about work or home life, anything in fact. ""You just think about the next wave and the next puff of wind coming. The wheelchair's not there, I'm a sailor and it's a huge feeling of freedom. ""But it's more than that. It's there that the pain dissipates. It doesn't entirely go away, when you smack a wave, wow, I feel it. But it's like an itch, if there's something else, you forget about it."" Despite her lack of movement, Lister still suffers from crippling pain thought to be caused by one particular fully functioning problematic nerve that sends a feeling of immense pain, heat or cold coursing through her veins. It's something that has to be treated with a daily diet of opiates and morphine, though the pain never properly vanishes. It does not, however, stop her from planning new expeditions. There is one dream trip for Lister, who is sponsored by GAC Pindar, that hangs above all others. ""I want a longer crossing and I'm looking at something for next year. ""The dream would be to sail across the Atlantic -- it's something I've been thinking about and looking into for a long time. But we're quite a way off from getting to that point. ""People talk about the dangers but I have a safety boat with me in case I capsize. There are dangers certainly but it's about risk management. There are more people hurt riding horses each year than sailing."" It is such dreams that give Lister hope as she sits back on her sofa thinking of a myriad of oceans still to explore.","Hilary Lister had decided to take her own life back in 2003 but then took up sailing .

"(CNN) -- Referee Tom Henning Ovrebo was understood to have been smuggled out of England by police after receiving a number of death threats following his officiating of the Champions League semifinal second leg between Chelsea and Barcelona -- according to the UK Press Association. Tom Henning Ovrebo's refereeing of the semifinal between Chelsea and Barcelona has proved controversial. British police were said to be so concerned about his safety they changed his hotel before organizing his secret exit while, in Ovrebo's home city of Oslo, police said they were investigating threats made on the internet. An Oslo police spokesman told PA: ""We are watching closely what is being posted on the internet. Anything we believe would threaten his personal safety will be taken seriously."" Following the reports, Chelsea released a statement making clear they condemned any form of threat against players, officials or supporters. Bad decisions or bad losers? - join the debate . The statement on the club's Web site confirmed Chelsea would take the strongest action possible against any season ticket holders or members who were proven to have participated in threatening activity, but stressed that no evidence had been received implicating Chelsea fans. Four years ago Swedish referee Anders Frisk retired after receiving death threats following his sending-off of Chelsea striker Didier Drogba in a Champions League game against Barcelona. Chelsea issued a statement condemning the actions of those who had abused Frisk at the time. Meanwhile, controversy still surrounds Chelsea's exit from this year's competition, with Ivory Coast striker Drogba confronting referee Henning after the game. However, Chelsea and England captain John Terry felt that Drogba had been justified to act in the way he did. ""I am fully behind Didier Drogba for the way he reacted,"" Terry told PA Sport. ""The man wants to win. You can see the passion that he played with during the game and the passion afterwards."" The 28-year-old slammed the Norwegian referee and accused UEFA of making a mistake by appointing Henning to referee the semifinal second leg. Chelsea looked to have set-up a repeat of last year's Champions League final against Manchester United before Andres Iniesta 93rd minute equaliser saw the Spaniards through on away goals. But it was Henning's performance that left Terry and his Chelsea team-mates fuming after the Norwegian refused to award Chelsea two spot-kicks in the first half when Florent Malouda and Drogba were both brought down. Then, in the second half, he turned down two handball penalty appeals after Gerard Pique handled as Nicolas Anelka tried to go past him and in the final seconds, after Iniesta's leveller, Michael Ballack's shot hit Samuel Eto'o's arm. Ballack was so incensed he protested alongside the referee for 40 yards before getting a yellow card. CNN's Pedro Pinto: ""Barcelona deserved to win"" - do you agree? Drogba, who had been substituted in the second half, then confronted the official after the game and received a yellow card for his protest before yelling an obscenity straight at the TV cameras. ""It is difficult when players are so high on emotions after the game and people were saying in the TV studios that we shouldn't be reacting the way we did,"" added Terry. ""That's impossible after having six or seven decisions go against you at home in front of your own fans. I've seen them all and two were clear penalties and you don't get one. How are you supposed to feel? ""It's a shambles really. Players dream of playing in these finals but we can't through bad refereeing. We get a referee who has refereed 10 Champions League games in his career and for him to be given the semifinal at Stamford Bridge is not good enough. ""Not one player made a mistake over the two legs but we come away with a referee making four or five big errors and now we are out of the competition. Maybe that referee would have been good enough in the group stages of the Champions League but on a big stage, with a big game and big players, he simply wasn't good enough."" Drogba has since apologized for his behavior in a statement on Chelsea's official Web site. ""I was very upset at what happened during the game, but having seen the pictures on TV I accept that I overreacted,"" said Drogba. The statement continued: ""I also accept that the language I used did not set a good example for those watching at home, especially children. I regret that in the heat of the moment I let out my incredible frustration and disappointment in this way, and for that I apologize."" Chelsea also released a statement praising Drogba's apology and claiming his actions were fuelled by frustration. ""Chelsea welcomes Didier's statement which was made honestly and after reflection. ""We are all acutely aware of the responsibilities that lie with both the club and its players towards setting a good example as role models. ""While it is clear that some of the events last night were regrettable, they occurred only because of the high emotions and frustrations which arose from the disappointment of a controversial defeat in such an important game. ""We made representations to UEFA immediately after the game and we await their comments following a review of the match report.""","Referee Tom Henning Ovrebo believed to have been smuggled out of England .

"Washington (CNN) -- After celebrating his second inauguration with a throng estimated at about 800,000, President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama spent the evening at more intimate affairs: 30,000 guests at two inaugural balls. The Obamas first swung by the Commander in Chief's Ball, where they danced in front of a sea of cell phone cameras to Jennifer Hudson's performance of Al Green's classic ""Let's Stay Together."" They then switched partners: the first lady danced with Marine Corps Gunnery Sgt. Timothy D. Easterling and the president danced with an Air Force Staff Sgt. Bria D. Nelson. Obama sang a bit of the same song at a campaign fundraiser in Harlem last year. The first lady wore a custom, ruby-colored gown designed by Jason Wu, who also designed her inaugural gown in 2009, and the president wore a tuxedo and white tie. Vice President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, also appeared at the two balls, dancing to Jamie Foxx performing Ray Charles' ""I Can't Stop Loving You."" Foxx portrayed the singer in the movie ""Ray."" Your inauguration photos . The Bidens also switched partners with military members, the vice president dancing with Army Staff Sgt. Keesha Nicole Dentino and Mrs. Biden with Navy Petty Officer Patrick Figueroa. Obama delivered the ""thanks of the American people"" to the members of the military at the service members' ball. ""Thank you for volunteering, thank you for stepping up, thanks for making us strong, thank you for keeping us safe,"" the commander-in-chief told the cheering revelers. He also told them that Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey had promised to sing, ""so hold him to that."" The Obamas also danced to ""Let's Stay Together"" at the Inaugural Ball, also held in the convention center. Hudson was one of 21 acts that were to perform at the two balls, including Alicia Keys, Brad Paisley, Far East Movement, fun., members of the cast of ""Glee,"" John Legend, Katy Perry, Marc Anthony, Mindless Behavior, Nick Cannon, Smokey Robinson, Soul Children of Chicago, Soundgarden, Stevie Wonder and Usher. Keys changed the lyrics of her hit ""Girl on Fire"" from ""This girl is on fire"" to ""Obama's on fire."" Organizers converted the convention center's massive, bare-bones exhibit hall into a slightly less bare-bones ballroom. No chandeliers here, just a few drapes and decorations to spruce up the exposed ceiling and fluorescent lights. Revelers danced on the center's industrial concrete floor. Kelly Clarkson's Inauguration Day diary . Seen close to the stage were the first lady's mother, Marian Robinson, and Obama adviser and family friend Valerie Jarrett. Former Obama campaign manager Jim Messina was seen in the crowd. The Inaugural Ball was split between two floors in the building, and attendees were not allowed to go from floor to floor. While Monday's events were the only two official balls, there were others in the city around the inauguration. On Sunday night, they included the Red, White and Blue Ball headlined by Lynyrd Skynyrd; the Hip Hop Ball, chaired by Russell Simmons with appearances by 2 Chainz, John Legend, Eva Longoria and Swizz Beatz; and the ""Latino In Performance"" and ""Let Freedom Ring!"" galas at the Kennedy Center. On Monday, the Creative Coalition was putting on a ball with a performance by the Goo Goo Dolls, while the Young and Powerful Black Tie Ball and the Congressional Black Caucus Inaugural Ball were also taking place in the city. Sponsors threw a ball for George Washington a week after his inauguration in New York in 1789, but the celebrations were established as a tradition with the inauguration of James Madison in Washington in 1809. The Obamas dashed around Washington to 10 balls in 2009, but like many things in his second inauguration -- smaller crowds, shorter lines, shorter speeches -- the number was reduced. President Bill Clinton's second inauguration in 1997 holds the record for most balls with 14. George W. Bush had eight balls in 2001 and nine in 2005.

Francesco Schettino painted a picture of chaos aboard the Costa Concordia on the night the cruise liner sank, as they testified Tuesday in Italy. The cruise liner capsized after it struck rocks off Italy's Giglio Island in the Tyrrhenian Sea in January 2012, killing 32 of the 4,200 people on board. INTERACTIVE: How ill-fated cruise liner was raised from Italian seabed . Schettino faces charges of manslaughter, causing a maritime disaster and abandoning ship with passengers still on board. He denies wrongdoing. Among several key witnesses Tuesday, on the second day of prosecution testimony against Schettino, was Moldovan dancer Domnica Cemortan, who dined with the captain and was with him on the command bridge at the time of the accident. Cemortan, who boarded the ship as a passenger but had worked on another Costa Cruises ship captained by Schettino a few weeks earlier, conceded under questioning that she had been romantically involved with him. Everything seemed normal at first on the bridge, she told the court, but then she heard Schettino giving orders, and then ""speaking angrily, yelling, to another officer"" and telling him to obey the order. She heard the alarms go off on the bridge, triggering chaos and confusion. She heard a call from the engine room that ""water had entered the ship."" The dancer left the bridge with Schettino and crew member Ciro Onorato, she said, following them around the vessel because she wasn't sure where they were going. They ended up near some lifeboats, where ""it was very slippery,"" she said. She and Onorato helped other passengers for about half an hour while the captain returned to the bridge, she said. Then Onorato pulled her into a lifeboat that also held other crew members. The boat hung over the side, and some panicked passengers fell into the water, she said. Cemortan said she has suffered psychological issues and taken medication to deal with the mass media attention after the wreck. She is also a party to the civil case against the captain. Disappointed by captain's actions . Onorato, who had dined with the pair, earlier told the court he was disappointed by Schettino's handling of events during and after the accident. Under cross-examination, Onorato was quizzed about Schettino's movements around the cruise liner and about how they both came to leave the ship. Onorato gave the same account as Schettino has given -- that the ship was falling on top of them and that they had no choice but to ""fall"" into a lifeboat. The defense also asked about Schettino's demeanor when he saw him on shore and whether or not the captain was trying to get back to the ship. The prosecution also focused on why Schettino decided to sail so close to the island's rocky coastline. Another witness, ship's maitre d' Antonello Tievoli, a Giglio resident, said he had asked the captain to do the ""flyby"" a week earlier -- and he acknowledged feeling guilty about having done so. He testified that Schettino had told him that he was going to do a ""close passage to the island"" on the day of the crash, and that the captain had invited him on to the bridge so he could see it. Tievoli messaged his sister on Facebook to tell her the ship would be passing by moments before the accident. He was planning to point out where his house was on Giglio to Schettino and other guests on the bridge. 'It is going to end up in the rocks' Schettino asked him to call a retired Costa Cruises captain, Mario Palombo, who lived on Giglio to say they'd be passing close by, Tievoli said. Palombo was not on the island that night, but he and Schettino spoke by telephone. Tievoli told the court that he had done previous ""close passages to the island,"" but none that close. Schettino had to ask the Costa Cruises company before changing his route and had done so before on a previous voyage, Cemortan said. Palombo, who took the stand after Cemortan, described Schettino as insincere and always hiding the truth, adding that he did not respect him. The retired captain said he had been surprised to get a call from Tievoli and then Schettino that evening because it was winter, so there were few people on Giglio to see the ""salute,"" or close passage to the shore. Schettino had asked him on the call about the waters around the island, he said. Palombo said a friend had then rung him, who said, ""I saw a ship passing by so close, it is going to end up in the rocks ... I've never seen a ship passing by so close. The lights are off."" Palombo said there was no set procedure for doing a ""salute"" and that the cruise line had never asked him to do one to publicize the brand. He'd done them only for his own sense of pride and seamanship, he said -- and always in summer and never with any ""risky maneuvers."" Plates, glasses flying . Tievoli testified that after the ship hit the rocks and alarms started blaring, he ran down to the restaurant to check the situation. He found a scene of chaos -- terrified passengers, with plates, food and glasses on the floor as the ship listed. The maitre d' told the court he left panicked elderly passengers in safe places where they wouldn't be hit by flying plates. He heard a message from the loudspeakers that the ship was suffering a blackout but did not hear the coded message for crew members only to prepare for emergency, Tievoli said. Once the general alarm was sounded, he and other crew members started preparing lifeboats so those on board could abandon ship, he said. He described lifting a man on crutches onto his back to carry him to safety. Questioned by the defense, the maitre d' said he'd crawled down a ladder to jump on the roof of a lifeboat on the ship's upright side. Tievoli said he met the island's deputy mayor climbing onto the ship to save passengers, which could undermine Schettino's argument that he could not get back on board after ""falling"" into the lifeboat. Hero or villain? The trial is expected to last through the fall with a string of witnesses, including passengers, crew members and islanders, who say they saw the captain on shore looking for dry socks before all the passengers had been safely evacuated. Schettino argues that he is a hero who saved the lives of more than 4,000 people, not a villain whose negligence led to the deaths of 32. His defense is trying to prove, among other things, that the ship's watertight doors did not function properly, and that is the reason the ship sank, leading to all 32 deaths during evacuation. The captain also has told the court that the ship would not have crashed had his helmsman turned it in the direction that Schettino told him to 13 seconds before impact. The helmsman, Jacob Rusli Bin, and four others were convicted in a plea deal in July for their role in the disaster. A Florence court is considering the validity of those plea bargain agreements. CNN's Hada Messia and journalist Barbie Latza Nadeau reported from Rome.

"Madrid (CNN) -- Spain's Princess Cristina faces preliminary charges in a financial corruption scandal involving her husband, Inaki Urdangarin, the office of investigating magistrate Jose Castro announced Wednesday. It's the first time since democracy was restored in Spain in 1975 that a direct member of King Juan Carlos' family has faced preliminary charges of any kind, in any case, a spokesman for the Royal Household said. Urdangarin, the king's son-in-law, already faces preliminary charges as a suspect in the fraud scandal that has created unprecedented problems for the popular royal family. He denies any wrongdoing. Now, both the princess and her husband are under investigation for allegedly diverting public funds earmarked for a non-profit foundation for private use. Late Wednesday, the Royal Household issued a statement saying it was surprised that the judge -- who last year said in an order that there were insufficient grounds to name the princess as a suspect with preliminary charges in the case -- had changed his mind. In his 18-page order Wednesday, the judge said that further investigation since last year had led to the decision to bring preliminary charges. The Royal Household statement also said that it is in ""absolute conformity"" with an announcement by prosecutors that they will appeal the judge's order to place preliminary charges on the princess. The Royal Household statement added that it maintains full respect for judicial decisions. Earlier Wednesday, the Royal Household press office tersely said that it does not comment on judicial decisions. But the story about the King's daughter dominated the news in Spain and was getting prominent coverage abroad as well. Finally, the Royal Household opted for its statement late in the day, after the prosecutors announced their move, a senior spokesman told CNN. The judge's order said Princess Cristina will be questioned on April 27 regarding ""the handling and destination of funds obtained"" through her husband's foundation and also a separate company. Urdangarin was granted the title of Duke of Palma when he married Princess Cristina, the king's youngest daughter, in 1997. Judge Castro is leading the investigation at a local court in Palma de Mallorca, in Spain's Balearic Islands. An adviser to the royal household also has been implicated in the scandal. Earlier this year, a judge ordered Urdangarin and a former business associate, Diego Torrres, to deposit a joint bond of 8 million euros ($10.8 million) for potential civil damages. If not, the judge would move to embargo the assets of the two men, a court spokeswoman said. No trial has been set in the case, which has riveted national attention. Although preliminary charges have been announced, they could eventually be dropped, but a filing of indictments would set a trial in motion.","NEW: Royal family issues statement about judge's decision, will appeal .

"(CNN) -- Scores of people were killed in violence across Syria on Monday, opposition activists said, while Russia insisted a political solution was the only answer to end the bloodshed. Here are fresh developments in Syria's bloody civil war: . Opposition: 50 regime soldiers killed at checkpoint . A suicide bomber killed at least 50 Syrian soldiers Monday at a checkpoint in Hama province, the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. The opposition group said the bomber was from the al-Nusra Front, which has claimed responsibility for past suicide attacks. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said a suicide bomber killed two people and injured 10 others. CNN cannot independently confirm government or opposition reports out of Syria, as the government has restricted access by journalists. At least 162 people were reported dead Monday across Syria, according to the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria. This figure includes 72 dead in Idlib province, among them 32 ""martyred (in a) massacre in Kafr Nabl."" Eight women, seven children and two citizen journalists were among the casualties, the LCC said. Samer Kreishi was killed in fighting in the Damascus suburb of Arbeen, where government forces and rebels have been fighting sporadically for months, the LCC said. Another journalist, Nasser Sheikhani, was killed during shelling in Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city, the group said. The two were described by the LCC as ""citizen journalists"" who routinely documented violence by government forces with the use of video and photographs, which were then uploaded on YouTube and other social media sites. More than 33,000 people have been killed since the Syrian conflict erupted in March 2011, the opposition says. Russian diplomat: 'No need for any type of resolution' Russia's top diplomat dismissed a call by the U.N.-Arab League special envoy for the Security Council to adopt a resolution calling for a transition of power in Syria. Read more: Russia: We won't back a foreign force in Syria . ""If the priority is the change of (the government), then there will be more blood. But if the priority is to save lives, then there is no need for any type of resolution,"" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Sunday after a meeting with the special envoy in Cairo. Lavrov's comments followed news that the special envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, called on the U.N. Security Council to adopt a resolution calling for a transition of power in Syria that permanent Security Council members agreed upon in June. The resolution, known as the Geneva deal, was put together by his predecessor, Kofi Annan, and called for a transitional government in Syria. Brahimi's call for the resolution came after the collapse of a holiday cease-fire he had pushed for between government forces and rebels. Security blog: U.S. says Russian attack helicopters on way to Syria . The Geneva agreement did not lay out how power would be transferred, nor did it spell out any role for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who has been under enormous international pressure to step down and end the conflict. China and Russia, permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, have repeatedly blocked attempts to adopt a resolution. Many have accused Russia of backing the Syrian government, but Russia says it just wants a political solution for Syria determined by its own people. China, meanwhile, has offered a four-point plan to end the war, calling for a cease-fire, plans for political settlement and transition, and international humanitarian aid. Bullets stray into Israel . An Israeli military vehicle was hit by bullets coming from southwestern Syria on Monday night, an Israeli military spokesman said, in what appears to be the latest instance of violence in Syria crossing into neighboring countries. No one was injured by the gunfire, and Israeli officials do not believe its vehicles were targeted, the spokesman said. But the bullets are believed to be related to Syria's ongoing civil war. Israel's military filed a complaint about the incident with the United Nations, according to the military spokesman. The nation did the same three days ago, when three Syrian army tanks entered the Golan Heights demilitarized zone, according to the Israeli military. The tanks were positioned with their guns pointing toward Syria and fired, Israel said. A U.N. observer force remains in the Golan Heights to maintain a cease-fire between the Israeli and Syrian forces and to oversee implementation of the disengagement agreement. Israel's government controls the Golan, though some internationally regard it as occupied territory. The Syrian civil war has spilled over into other countries as well, including Lebanon and Turkey. Stray shelling from Syria into southern Turkey has caused several deaths in recent weeks, ratcheting up tensions between the one-time allies and spurring Istanbul to order the firing of artillery rounds back into their neighbor's territory. Rebels regroup . Syria's opposition groups began a second day of negotiations Monday in Qatar's capital city of Doha as part of an effort to unify the rebellion. The move comes after reports that U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told reporters that the exiled Syrian National Council should no longer be considered the ""visible leader"" of efforts to form a government to replace al-Assad, whose iron-fisted attempt to crush anti-government protests has resulted in the bloody civil war. Security blog: U.S., Russia grapple for common ground on Syria transition . Clinton said the opposition must include seats for ""those who are on the front lines fighting and dying today."" The United States has recommended people and organizations that should be included, she said -- and the State Department says Robert Ford, the U.S. ambassador to Syria, will be ""on the sidelines"" of the upcoming Doha talks. The U.S. secretary of state's remarks drew criticism from some opposition activists Monday. In a statement, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said they represented unwelcome ""interventions in the affairs of the revolution."" State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Monday that the United States does not intend to pick Syria's next leaders. ""Only Syrians can do this,"" she told reporters, ""so, none of the activities that we've been involved in since the last months and months are designed to do that. They're simply designed to insure that those Syrian voices inside Syria...are heard and are part of the process."" French President Francois Hollande made a similar statement Sunday, saying that the Syrian opposition needs a leader to set up ""an interim government through a fair democratic process,"" the state-run Saudi Press Agency reported. Read more: Putting the monkey on Lavrov's back . The negotiations in Doha began after the SNC announced it would elect a new president, replace half of its executive board and expand its membership. The SNC says its meetings are a prelude to talks with other opposition groups later this week. ""Any discussion about bypassing the SNC or forming other alternative entities is an attempt to damage the revolution and sow the seeds of division and discord,"" the group said in a statement. CNN's Sara Sidner, Jill Dougherty, Tracy Doueiry and Saad Abedine contributed to this report.","NEW: 162 are dead in Syria, including 32 in a ""massacre"" in Idlib province, opposition says .

"Washington (CNN) -- Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson is ordering more security for more than 9,500 federal government buildings and their 1.4 million daily visitors. Johnson said in a statement Tuesday that the Federal Protective Service's new security measures are a precautionary guard against ""continued public calls by terrorist organizations for attacks on the homeland and elsewhere"" after two attacks last week on Canada's government. But Johnson didn't reveal the details of the new security measures, saying they'll vary by location. ""The precise actions we are taking and the precise locations at which we will enhance security is law-enforcement sensitive, will vary and shift from location to location, and will be continually re-evaluated,"" Johnson said in the statement. A Homeland Security official told CNN there is ""no new intelligence"" suggesting that U.S. government buildings face additional threats, and emphasized that the changes are a ""precautionary measure"" that only apply to buildings secured by the Federal Protective Service.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Two German doctors treated Michael Jackson's insomnia with propofol 12 years before he died from an overdose of the surgical anesthetic, his former wife testified Wednesday. Debbie Rowe, who is the mother of Jackson's two oldest children, is being forced to testify about the singer's drug use by lawyers for AEG Live, the concert promoter being sued by members of Jackson's family, who say the promoter is responsible for his death. Doctors ""would try to outbid"" each other on who could give Michael Jackson ""the better drug"" for his pain, Rowe testified Wednesday. Jackson family matriarch Katherine Jackson sat Wednesday morning in the front row of the small courtroom, where she has spent much of the past 16 weeks watching the trial. Dr. Allen Metzger -- Jackson's general practitioner in the United States -- arranged for the German anesthesiologists to infuse the singer with propofol in a Munich hotel in July 1997 after sedatives failed to help him sleep between concerts, Rowe testified. ""I think they tried it and it hadn't worked and if he couldn't sleep, he couldn't perform,"" she testified. Jackson ""was at the end of his rope; he didn't know what else to do."" He ""felt better"" after eight hours of propofol-induced sleep and decided to get a second treatment after his second Munich show, she said. Metzger testified at the criminal trial of Dr. Conrad Murray that he was never involved in giving propofol treatments for Jackson and was not aware of the drug until much later. Rowe, who met Jackson when she worked as a nurse in the Beverly Hills office of Dr. Arnold Klein, backed away from her previous statement at her deposition in which she said doctors also gave Jackson propofol infusions in hotels in France during the HIStory tour. AEG Live contends that Jackson used propofol for years to treat his insomnia, including when Rowe was traveling with him in Europe in the 1990s. The coroner ruled Jackson died on June 25, 2009, from a propofol overdose administered by Murray, who is serving a prison sentence for involuntary manslaughter. Rowe testified that Jackson underwent surgery in 1993 to repair burns suffered years earlier. His doctors ""couldn't get a grip of the pain"" and that two doctors ""were having a pissing contest over who gave him the better drug."" ""Michael had a very low pain tolerance, and his fear of pain was incredible,"" Rowe testified. ""And I think that doctors took advantage of him that way."" Rowe has rarely given interviews since her divorce from the pop icon, although she did testify in her former husband's defense during his child molestation trial in 2005. Jackson was acquitted on all charges in that case. Jackson lawyers smiled as the trial recessed for the lunch break, indicating that they believed the defense witness was actually supporting their case. ""Michael respected doctors immensely, that they went to school, that they studied and to do no harm,"" Rowe said. ""Unfortunately, some of the doctors decided that when Michael was in pain or something that they would try to outbid on who could give him the better drug and so he listened to those doctors."" Rowe said many of the doctors who treated Jackson were ""idiots,"" including the dermatologist she worked for from 1979 until she quit in 1996 before she married Jackson. ""The only physician who ever cared for Michael as Michael was Allen Metzger,"" Rowe testified. ""So Metzger continued as his doctor?"" AEG Live lawyer Marvin Putnam asked. ""I don't know, because Conrad Murray got in there and killed him,"" Rowe replied -- a reference to the doctor AEG Live is accused of hiring. AEG Live executives, who were promoting and producing Jackson's comeback concerts, had no way of knowing that Murray was infusing him with propofol each night for two months in the spring of 2009, Putnam said. ""Almost no one knew until after his death,"" he said. ""AEG Live certainly didn't know about it."" The Jackson family's lawyers contend that the promoters ignored warning signs that Jackson's health was deteriorating during the two months before his death. Instead of getting him to another doctor who might have saved his life, they gave Murray the responsibility of getting Jackson to rehearsals, they argue. Michael Jackson's mother and three of her children contend AEG Live is liable in his death because it negligently hired, retained or supervised Murray. The company's agreement to pay Murray $150,000 a month put the doctor in a conflict of interest because he was in deep debt and could not risk losing the job by refusing Jackson's demands for propofol, their lawyers contend. AEG Live argues that while its executives negotiated with Murray to serve as Jackson's physician for the ""This Is It"" tour, it was Jackson who chose and controlled the doctor. One revelation from Rowe was that a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon faked doing a procedure on Jackson on two occasions, although he told the singer he had done it. Jackson complained about painful scars in his nose and went to Dr. Steven Hoefflin to inject them with collagen, she said. ""He put Michael out and didn't do anything but put tape on him as if he had treated him,"" Rowe testified. The doctor told her he did that because he could not find the scars Jackson thought were there. Wednesday is the 69th day of testimony in the trial, which the judge told jurors would likely be given to them for deliberations in late September.

"(CNN) -- Luis Suarez may have bitten off more than he can chew this time. Already banned twice in his career for biting an opponent, the Uruguay striker was seemingly at it again in his country's key World Cup victory over Italy. Just before Uruguay's winning goal, the striker was embroiled in an off the ball incident with Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini with both men falling to the floor. Television pictures showed Suarez dipping his head towards Chiellini, and when the Italian defender eventually got up, he pulled down his shirt and appeared to furiously indicate that he had been bitten on the shoulder. ""Suarez is a sneak and he gets away with it because FIFA want their stars to play in the World Cup,"" Chiellini told Sky Sports Italia. ""I'd love to see if they have the courage to use video evidence against him. The referee saw the bite mark too, but he did nothing about it.,"" added the Juventus defender. The 27-year-old Suarez will now face a nervous wait to find out if football's world governing body FIFA will take action retrospectively -- given it was missed by the match officials - and punish him. A FIFA spokesman told CNN: ""We are awaiting the official match reports and will gather all the necessary elements in order to evaluate the matter."" But FIFA vice-president Jim Boyce, who is also presides as head of the body's referees committee, says he has huge concerns over Suarez's actions. ""I have watched the incident several times on television,"" he told reporters. ""There is no doubt Luis Suarez is a fantastic footballer but, once again, his actions have left him open to severe criticism. ""FIFA must investigate the incident seriously and take whatever disciplinary action deemed necessary."" But Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez insists he did not see the incident when he addressed the press in his news conference. ""I'd like to see the images,"" he said. ""I didn't see that. And if it happened the referee probably didn't see it. So no I don't have any more comments to make. We had more important things than this in a football match. ""There seems there is animosity against this football player,"" he added. ""He just came out of a difficult moment and he has been penalized. There are people hiding behind the tree waiting for something to happen."" Diego Godin's 81st minute header secured victory for Uruguay against an Italian team which played the final half hour with 10-men after Claudio Marchisio was sent off. The defeat led to Italian coach Cesare Prandelli offering his resignation in his news conference after the game -- but all eyes were still on Suarez. The Uruguayan, who plays his club football with Liverpool, was banned for 10 games in April 2013 after being found guilty of biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic. He was also guilty of biting during his time in the Netherlands with Ajax where he was banned for seven games after leaving a scar on the collarbone of Otman Bakkal. Suarez's rap sheet is lengthy. At the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, he deliberately handled the ball on the goal-line to deny Ghana a place in the semifinals of the World Cup. He was sent off for his troubles but Ghana missed the penalty and Uruguay went on to finish third in the tournament. The following year after his move to Liverpool, Suarez was found guilty of racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra. He was fined $63,000 and banned for eight matches. Last week, after scoring both goals in his side's 2-1 victory over England, Suarez hit out at the British media after claiming he had been unfairly treated over his transgressions. ""Before the game people in England laughed about my attitude over the last few years,"" he told reporters following the game. ""I want to see what they think now. I have dreamed of this moment."" Suarez enjoyed a sensational season with Liverpool -- scoring 31 league goals to help his club qualify for the Champions League. He was voted Player of the Year by his fellow colleagues and also named as the journalists' Player of the Year too -- awards that reflected a feeling that Suarez had put behind him his troubled past. His participation in the World Cup had looked in danger when he suffered a knee injury in Liverpool's final game of the season. He was forced to undergo keyhole surgery and missed Uruguay's opening game defeat by Costa Rica before making a near miraculous return in time to face England just five weeks after his operation, scoring both goals in the South American side's 2-1 win. Uruguay's next game is likely to be against Colombia on Saturday in Rio de Janeiro. Meanwhile, Italy coach Prandelli says he will step down following another World Cup disappointment. Prandelli, who replaced Marcello Lippi as coach in 2010, also failed to guide Italy out of the group stage in South Africa four years ago. ""At the end of the match I spoke to the president of the federation, I have told them I am going to resign from my position,"" he told reporters. ""When there is failure, the person in charge must take responsibility,"" added Prandelli, who only extended his contract last month. Giancarlo Abete, the president of the Italian Football Federation, also announced his resignation while stating he hoped to convince Prandelli to stay on. In the group's other game, Costa Rica sealed top spot with a goalless draw against England. Los Ticos, which won both of its previous games, will play its next game in Recife on Sunday.","Uruguay defeats Italy 1-0 to book place in knockout phase .

The ABC dating competition show doesn't have the best track record when it comes to lasting love connections, and the show's latest match, Juan Pablo Galavis and Nikki Ferrell, have reportedly called it quits. This isn't entirely surprising, considering the couple has fought off rumors that they were ill-fated from the start. During his season on ""The Bachelor,"" which aired this year, Galavis was reviled by fans for his apparent lack of sensitivity toward the women competing to be his love interest. By the time he got down to his final two options, Galavis wasn't interested in proposing to either contestant, although he did want to pursue a relationship with Ferrell. One of the big sticking points for fans was Galavis' refusal to say whether he was in love with Ferrell. 'The Bachelor': Six ways Juan Pablo lost this season . The months that followed ""The Bachelor's"" finale in the spring were filled with rumors of a breakup, and those rumors only became louder when Ferrell and Galavis signed up for season 5 of VH1's ""Couple's Therapy.""

"Washington (CNN) -- A soldier being examined for possible post-traumatic stress disorder buys a gun off base and fails to register it with a commander, as required. Now Spc. Ivan Lopez is dead, along with three others, in the second major shooting at Fort Hood in less than five years. Changes implemented after the 2009 massacre in which Maj. Nidal Hasan killed 13 people and injured dozens resulted in a better response by military police to Wednesday's incident at the sprawling Texas military base, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno told a Senate panel. However, few immediate answers emerged about how the military can prevent someone undergoing psychiatric evaluation from illegally bringing a firearm on base. It is one of several recurring security questions involving military bases, particularly Fort Hood, the nation's largest Army base and scene of the 2009 attack as well as the 2011 arrest of an Army private who tried to build a bomb to blow up troops stationed there. ""Something went wrong"" ""As we watched some of the events unfold yesterday, we saw some of the benefits and gains made out of that first Fort Hood experience,"" Army Secretary John McHugh told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday. ""But something happened, something went wrong, and we need to know what that was."" The problem is not limited to Fort Hood. Last year, a gunman with access to the Washington Navy Yard in the nation's capital killed 12 people before police shot him to death. Steps taken in response to the 2009 Fort Hood shootings included creating a kind of ""neighborhood watch"" to teach the Army community to recognize and report suspicious behavior, as well as plans to educate commanders on signs of workplace violence, and an enhanced 911 system. Fort Hood shooting spree . Odierno said training for how to respond to a live shooter situation, including alert procedures, helped prevent Wednesday's violence from being ""much, much worse."" A resident at the base, Lynn Adams, said authorities check identification and other things, but overall, ""there hasn't been a whole lot of extra protection on base"" in the aftermath of the 2009 killings. After Wednesday's latest Fort Hood shootings, military and security analysts distinguished between the specific issue of security at the Army base and the broader debate over federal and state gun control laws. Lopez legally purchased a .45 caliber handgun at a gun store in Killeen, where Fort Hood is located, sources told CNN. He then took the weapon onto the base, which violated military regulations because he didn't register it there. Two issues involved . Those are two distinct steps -- one involving background checks of people seeking to buy firearms and the other about security protocols at the base where more than 50,000 people live and work each day, noted former FBI Assistant Director Tom Fuentes, CNN's law enforcement analyst. ""This is not a U.S. penitentiary,"" Fuentes said of Fort Hood. ""They're not going to search every car, every trunk, pat down every person going through there. It's a city. It's a working city."" He also noted the base includes soldiers preparing for combat deployment, meaning ""you have an extra percentage of the population that are trained to kill, if you will."" Fort Hood shooter was Iraq vet . ""So this is to be expected,"" Fuentes said. ""We don't want it to happen and we say we're going to do everything to stop it from happening, but we're just fooling ourselves. It's not going to be completely eliminated. There's not everything you can do to completely stop this on military bases or in any other city for that matter."" Killeen Mayor Dan Corbin shared that opinion, telling CNN that ""there's no way that we could be ... 100% certain that someone doesn't have a gun at Fort Hood."" ""That's logistically impossible,"" Corbin added. A 1993 ban on private weapons at military bases got expanded at Fort Hood following the Hasan killings, making Lopez's possession of his handgun on the base illegal. In response to Wednesday's shootings, which also injured 16 people including three critically, Republican Rep. Steve Stockman of Texas called for ending the restrictions. Let soldiers carry weapons on bases? ""This is the third mass shooting on a military base in five years, and it's because our trained soldiers aren't allowed to carry defensive weapons,"" Stockman said. ""Anti-gun activists have turned our military bases into soft targets for killers."" Odierno, however, said Thursday that the armed military police and other base security personnel provided enough protection. ""Although we carry arms quite regularly overseas when we we're deployed on a regular basis, I believe back here in the United States, it's more appropriate that we leave it to that,"" he said in response to a question from GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. Republican Rep. Peter King of New York earlier told CNN that his military experience showed the benefit of preventing ordinary soldiers from having firearms on base. ""You have a situation where in a barracks on Saturday night, you may have arguments, fights,"" King said, adding that military brass should talk to ""the sergeants, the NCOs, the officers and people on the ground"" about the effect that access to firearms could have on regular order and discipline before making any change. Again, a female cop is a hero at Fort Hood . King and others called instead for better screening of possible mental illness among troops, a major issue for the military dealing with the impact of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Lopez had a history of depression, anxiety and other psychiatric disorders, and was receiving treatment and taking antidepressants, according to military officials. ""At the end of the day, it's not going to be about the gun necessarily, it's going to be about the soldier and the care that he should have gotten that he wasn't getting, or somebody knew,"" said retired Army Lt. Gen. Russel Honore. ""At the bottom, there's a sergeant that knows that there's something wrong with that soldier, that he needed more help. At the bottom of this, there's a captain that knows."" Continuity of care . CNN Military Analyst James ""Spider"" Marks, a retired major general, noted that Lopez had been transferred from another military base to Fort Hood two months ago, which broke the continuity of any care he received for his mental issues. ""You wouldn't have done that with a soldier who was undergoing some other type of physical, visible ailment. You would have left that young soldier where he or she was,"" Marks said, adding that ""I think that is a part of this process that needs to be evaluated as well."" Odierno said the Army does ""quite significant screening today, but it doesn't mean it's right and it doesn't mean we can't improve it."" ""We have to constantly evaluate this,"" he told the Senate panel. ""This is something that we are going to have to deal with for a very long period of time, and that's the consequence of 13 years of war."" What is it about Fort Hood? The broader issue of U.S. gun laws raises more volatile and irreconcilable differences. ""This is yet another story, a person with psychiatric problems walking into a gun shop and being able to obtain a weapon and ammunition and go shoot who he wants,"" Fuentes said. ""There's no indication of any political will to change that situation, so we'll just have to deal with it as it comes."" To emphasize his point, he noted how proposals for tougher gun laws failed to pass Congress after the 2012 killings in Connecticut of 20 first-graders and six educators by a 20-year-old man with known mental health issues who had access to family firearms. ""If a massacre of children doesn't change situations like that, this certainly won't,"" Fuentes said. Gun control debate . However, Republican Rep. John Carter of Texas called the state's current system of background checks adequate, and Corbin, the Killeen mayor, warned that increasing restrictions could cause unintended consequences. ""If we impose restrictions on the ability to carry or get a concealed handgun permit because someone is starting to seek help for problems they have, that could serve as a disincentive and keep people from seeking treatment,"" Corbin told CNN. A CNN/ORC International poll in November, as the first anniversary of the Connecticut school shootings approached, showed the nation evenly split on the issue. In Washington, House Speaker John Boehner told reporters on Thursday that ""there's no question that those with mental health issues should be prevented from owning weapons or being able to purchase weapons."" He touted funding for pilot programs studying the matter in legislation passed by Congress, calling the issue something ""we need to continue to look at to find a way to keep weapons out of the hands of people who should not have them."" CNN's Dana Bash, Barbara Starr, Faith Karimi and Steve Almasy contributed to this report.","A soldier examined for mental issues buys a gun and opens fire .

"(CNN) -- The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating a near miss between two jets near Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport this month. The two planes were within about a mile of each other on May 9, the FAA said. ""The closest proximity between the two planes was 0.87 miles laterally and 400 feet vertically, about two miles southeast of the airport,"" the FAA said. The incident involved United Airlines Flights 601 and 437. Both had recently taken off. ""The controller issued instructions to both pilots to safely separate the aircraft,"" an FAA statement said. Audio from the control tower confirms that controllers asked Flight 437 to turn right immediately, while they told Flight 601 to ""stop your turn, stop your climb, stop your turn."" CNN sought a comment from United early Friday but has not received a response yet. A near miss does not cause any injuries but is enough of a close call that the details surrounding such incidents are investigated. It's also worth noting that the FAA uses the term, near midair collision, for more serious events in which two airplanes come within 500 feet of one another, whereas near miss is a more subjective term. There were 4,394 near misses in the year ending September 1, 2012, according to an FAA report. Forty-one incidents were characterized as ""high-risk events,"" and none resulted in accidents. In the year ending September 1, 2011, there were 1,895 such incidents, according to the FAA. As a result of last month's near miss at Newark Liberty International Airport, the rules for takeoffs and landings at the New Jersey airport were changed. In that April 24 incident, an Embraer ERJ-145 operated by ExpressJet was cleared to take off on a runway at the same time United Flight 1243, a Boeing 737, was landing on the intersecting runway. The 737 flew 135 yards away vertically and 50 yards away laterally from the smaller regional jet. Close calls at Newark had happened before, including four in 2008, according to a Department of Transportation inspector general's report. There was also a recent incident in Florida in which the FAA confirmed a commercial jet landing at Tallahassee Regional Airport nearly collided midair with a drone. It was so close, the jet pilot thought the two aircraft had collided. In October, the pilots of a pair of 747s, carrying more than 1,000 passengers, misinterpreted air-traffic control orders and came within 100 feet of colliding over Scotland. A former FAA crash investigation chief told CNN, ""Everybody got it wrong."" CNN's Eliott C.McLaughlin and Aaron Cooper contributed to this report.","Two jets were less than a mile from each other .

"(CNN) -- Good luck recognizing Kevin Smith these days. The director and sometime actor has not only slimmed down, he also shaved, which has left him looking decidedly less Kevin Smith-like. According to his Instagram account, Smith has lost 20 pounds after going off added and processed sugars for a few weeks. ""Day 17 of no added or processed sugar. Down 20 pounds. Feeling so good, I'm hiking the hills with my wiener out,"" read the caption on a photo of him walking his dachshund. Not content to stop at the weight loss, Smith also shaved his famous beard. ""Look at this goofy spaz,"" Smith wrote on Instagram. ""This is me, beardless, for the #YogaHosers green screen shoot. #FaceBrazilian."" ""Yoga Hosers"" is a new film written and directed by Smith. IMDb describes the plot as ""Two teenage yoga enthusiasts team up with a legendary man-hunter to battle with an ancient evil presence that is threatening their major party plans."" The film is set for a 2015 release. The director isn't the only well-known person to shed some weight lately. According to the New York Daily News, the Rev. Al Sharpton has shrunk from a high of 305 pounds to recently weighing in at 129.6 pounds. The activist and commentator said he got the weight off by cutting out red meat and then most other foods until he got down to just having tea, toast and juice for breakfast and fruit, tea and a salad with a hard-boiled egg at lunch. Like Smith, he exercises and stays away from added and processed sugars. Sharpton found that the less he ate, the less he missed food. ""I could take all the cartoons in the tabloid newspapers, but I couldn't take my daughter punching me in the belly and asking why I was so fat,"" he told the paper. ""That was my inspiration to lose the weight. And probably the last time anyone hurt my feelings.""","Filmmaker Kevin Smith gave up added and processed sugars to lose about 20 pounds .

"(CNN) -- Very few people outside of comic book store regulars knew what ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" was before this past summer, and yet it's now the biggest movie of 2014 so far. Marvel hopes to continue that astounding success for years to come. So when the studio announced its movie slate through 2019, there were character names and terms used that might be unfamiliar to a lot of moviegoers. But never fear -- we're here to explain. 'Captain Marvel' Set for July 6, 2018, the movie about Carol Danvers' cosmic alter ego caused a lot of excitement on social media, especially among fans who feel that female comic book characters have gotten short shrift on the big screen (something which rival DC Comics recently addressed by announcing a ""Wonder Woman"" movie). Captain Marvel first appeared in the comics in 1968, sharing the name of a once wildly popular character from the 1940s (which was the subject of a lawsuit with DC in 1952 for his similarities to Superman). Marvel's version of Captain Marvel was originally an alien officer, and the name has been transferred to multiple characters over the years. However, Captain Marvel achieved new popularity when Carol (previously Ms. Marvel) assumed the Captain's mantle. The character has been something of Marvel's answer to Wonder Woman, so in some ways, it makes sense that she would be the star of its first female-led movie. (The long-rumored ""Black Widow"" movie appears to be on hold, at least for now.) 'Black Panther' The first black superhero in mainstream comics appeared in 1966, and will make his big screen debut on November 3, 2017. Chadwick Boseman will portray the character (though he will be seen in the next ""Captain America"" movie first), who hails from the fictional African nation of Wakanda and is chief of the tribes there. In the comics, he has been an on-again, off-again member of the Avengers, and even replaced Daredevil for a brief time. In 2006, he married the X-Men character Storm. 'Doctor Strange' Up until now, this is the character we've heard the most about, especially when it comes to plentiful casting rumors (most recently, Benedict Cumberbatch). What we know is that the movie is out on November 4, 2016 (delayed from July), directed by Scott Derrickson. And the doctor title is for real -- he was a neurosurgeon before becoming a sorcerer. Since 1963, anything involving the occult would eventually lead in the direction of the good doctor. (And check out that incredible cape!) 'The Inhumans' November 2, 2018 will see another Marvel movie, not necessarily based on a household name. The Inhumans are actually a race of superhumans (not to be confused with the X-Men) that has a royal family. They're a society in and of themselves. And it doesn't hurt that they can live about 150 years. There's more than enough material here for what Marvel surely hopes will be a franchise of ""Inhumans"" movies. 'Thor: Ragnarok' Ever wanted to see Chris Hemsworth face off against himself? Looks like you'll get your chance in the third ""Thor"" movie (which co-stars fan favorite Tom Hiddleston) on July 28, 2017. Ragnarok is a cyborg clone of Thor who is up to no good. This will almost certainly put the Superman vs. Clark Kent fight from ""Superman III"" to shame. 'Captain America: Civil War' As long rumored, Robert Downey Jr. will once again reprise his Iron Man role in this ""Captain America"" three-quel. 2006's ""Civil War"" is one of the most memorable recent story arcs in Marvel Comics, with Cap and Iron Man coming to blows over the Superhero Registration Act, which requires anyone with powers to register themselves with the government. Tony Stark is all for it, but Steve Rogers, not so much. 'Avengers: Infinity War' This is the big kahuna, which will take place over two movies, releasing on May 4, 2018, and May 3, 2019. Marvel promises these two films will bring everything that preceded them to a head. The 1992 comic book story involved many characters of the Marvel Universe, and followed up on a previous story arc setting up Thanos (most recently seen in the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" movie) as one of the big bads of Marvel Comics. This promises to be the big showdown between the Avengers and one of the most powerful villains of all. The next five years will be huge for Marvel fans, no doubt about it.","Marvel has announced its slate of movies through 2019 .

"(CNN) -- Former ""Good Morning America"" co-host Joan Lunden revealed on Tuesday that she has been diagnosed with breast cancer. Posting to fans via Twitter and a letter on her website JoanLunden.com, Lunden said she had received an all-clear two weeks ago after her annual mammogram, but ""for women who have dense fibrous breast tissue, as I do, often our doctors will recommend an ultrasound as well."" ""My ultrasound that day revealed a tumor in my right breast,"" she wrote. ""After a core biopsy was performed, I heard those words that every woman fears and that I never thought I'd hear: 'you have breast cancer.' "" Lunden, who co-hosted ""GMA"" from 1980 to 1997, said she initially considered keeping the news private, but decided to go public with her diagnosis. ""I have decided to talk about my breast cancer because since the moment I took the job at 'Good Morning America' I have lived my life sharing my joys and my disappointments with all of you: my pregnancies, my relationships, my career,"" she said. ""I have shared my journey. So it certainly didn't feel right keeping this part of my journey a secret."" Lunden turned to current ""GMA"" co-host and breast cancer survivor Robin Roberts to offer her first TV interview about having the disease. The news hit home for the staff, as ""GMA"" co-host Amy Robach is currently being treated for breast cancer. Lunden told Roberts that the form of cancer she has is particularly aggressive. ""In the beginning it's such a shock, it's a stunner,"" Lunden told Roberts. ""For me, I'm a health advocate, I'm all over America talking to women saying, 'Make sure you get all of your checkups.' In the beginning you almost feel like 'What did I do wrong?'"" Lunden, whose late father was a cancer surgeon, said she gets mammograms every year. She is now in ""warrior mode"" learning everything she can about the disease and is currently undergoing chemotherapy, she said.","Lunden announced her diagnosis on Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- Banks are being scrutinized over the extreme working hours put in by interns following the sudden death of a 21-year-old undergraduate at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Moritz Erhardt collapsed and died in rented accommodation in east London last week, the bank confirmed. According to city workers on the internet forum Wall Street Oasis, he had worked until 6 a.m. for three days in a row. While no direct link has been made, the death of the German business student has put the spotlight on grueling hours suffered by interns looking to impress bosses and competing with each other. Internships such as Erhardt's pay around Â£45,000 ($70,500) a year, pro rata, and jostling comes as youth unemployment in Europe soars to record levels, hitting 23% in 2012. A BAML spokesman said the bank was ""shocked and saddened"" by the news. The spokesman declined to comment on unconfirmed reports Erhardt had epilepsy. Cass Business School professor Andre Spicer told CNN interns are expected to work long hours to show their commitment to prospective employers, rather than being productive. ""The real reasons are cultural. All-nighters are seen as a rite of passage,"" Spicer said. ""They show an intern is willing to push themselves beyond any reasonable limits at work ... if large firms hope to be sustainable and attractive to employees, they need to tackle the extreme hours culture,"" he said. According to the bank, all BAML interns are assigned a ""buddy,"" and some get a staffing officer whose job it is to allocate work across the group to make sure it's manageable. Katerina Rudiger, head of skills and policy campaign at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, told CNN employers try to make internships a positive experience for young people. Balance must be kept, she said, to ensure interns were not overburdened. She said: ""Young people really struggle with market access and they can be quite desperate... to get their foot on the job ladder and are willing to do whatever it takes. In some cases that can be too much."" Rudiger added: ""Another issue is that a lot of young people have not experienced a work place before so they don't know the rules and what is expected of them. They don't challenge their employers."" Erhardt was in the sixth week of a seven week internship when he died. Bank of America's interns have since been told they can leave the program early without negatively affecting chances of future employment. Dillon Khan, author of the The Intern, told CNN increased media scrutiny on internships, particularly in the UK, is forcing companies to be more careful when employing young people. He said: ""It's the type of news story that will catch fire very quickly, if a reputable organization is not doing its duty with interns. Organizations are very conscious of these things because they don't want a bad reputation."" Erhardt -- who had completed internships with a number of other banks -- was staying in a ground-floor flat at Claredale House, a four-storey building known as ""Banker's block"" due to its reputation for housing interns in the summer months. The BAML spokesman said of Erhardt: ""He was popular amongst his peers and was a highly-diligent intern at our company with a promising future. Our first thoughts are with his family and we send our condolences to them at this difficult time.""

"(CNN) -- Fast-food restaurants that have long catered to the hungry patron with super-sized entrees are now targeting the nibbler, offering smaller, snack-sized portions. Dairy Queen is the latest eatery to shrink a popular menu item. In late July, it plans to roll out a 7-ounce Mini Blizzard, 5 ounces tinier than its current ""small"" frozen treat. ""Our customers really wanted it,"" said Dean Peters, International Dairy Queen's associate vice president of communications. ""They really requested a smaller-portion size of our blizzard -- smaller appetites. We also felt there was an opportunity there with a smaller size Blizzard -- which is our signature product -- to perhaps bundle it with a combo meal or a food meal, as well."" Dairy Queen isn't the only big-name restaurant shrinking menu items. Last February, Burger King introduced a line of mini-burgers called ""BK Burger Shots."" Executives at the time touted that while the product ""might look small ... they are full of the big, flame-broiled taste."" McDonald's Big Mac Snack Wrap also hit stores last year. This offering relocates the innards of the Big Mac -- burger, pickle, special sauce, lettuce, cheese -- in a tortilla to create a small burger-burrito hybrid. There have been sporadic attempts to downsize on fast-food menus in recent years. Denver-based Quiznos, began offering a tiny wrap sandwich called the Sammie geared to snackers in 2007. And doughnut shops like Dunkin' Donuts have fed the masses with doughnut holes rebranded as ""Munchkins"" (or Timbits, if you're a patron of Tim Hortons). DQ unveiled its Mini Blizzard after seven months of testing in about 100 of its 5,700 stores. The new size comes on the 25th birthday of the frozen treat and the 70th anniversary of the chain. ""We really felt that this was an opportune time to introduce our Mini Blizzard to all of our loyal customers, and of course people can come in more often and enjoy their favorite Blizzard flavor,"" Peters says. But just because the menu item shrinks doesn't mean it will stick around. Despite a Twilight-themed media blitz in 2009, BK Burger Shots have disappeared from the Burger King menu. Officials weren't immediately available for comment as to why.","Fast-food restaurants are now targeting the nibbler, with smaller, snack-sized portions .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Despite the fact that some of the effects of climate change are still imperceptible to all but the most highly trained eyes, there can be no doubting the alarming picture painted by glacier melt. The iPhone application includes audio, video, slideshows and a documentary film. As these rivers of ice retreat back up the valleys they carved out, so scientists' knowledge of climate change advances, in turn helping us recognize the signs of a warming world. Now a new iPhone app is helping visitors to the Swiss Alps understand how climate change is altering the landscape. Developed by the Oeschger Center for Climate Change Research at the University of Bern in Switzerland and Swiss software company, Texetera, the Jungfrau Climate Guide is an interactive guide to glaciers and climate change. For a fee of 20 CHF (around $19) visitors to the Jungfrau Alpine region can hire an iPhone loaded with the app. Kaspar Meuli, Head of Communications at the Oeschger Center, told CNN what people can expect from the device. ""There are many different levels to the application. Audio pieces -- like the ones you might expect to find in a museum guide which guide you through paths on seven different trails."" At different stages along each trail, the phones -- aided by the built-in GPS -- alert visitors to particular points of interest by sounding a yodel. ""For example,"" Meuli explained, ""if you are standing in front of a glacier you will be told why it is no longer as big and provided with images of what it looked like 100 years ago, and what it might look like in the future."" There are more than 40 audio guides, plus a range of multimedia offerings including videos, slide shows and a documentary film. There are also sections which describe the various flora on the trails along with information on biodiversity. ""Everyone who tries it is quite fascinated by it,"" Meuli said. ""People are realizing that climate change is real when they see the consequences."" The Jungfrau region is home to the upper and lower Grindelwald glaciers, which have retreated rapidly in recent years. In 2008, the World Glacier Monitoring Service reported that glaciers in some regions of the world were melting away at a rate of more than a meter a year recently. Responding to the 2008 report, Achim Steiner, Executive Director of the U.N. Environmental Program, said: ""Millions, if not billions, of people depend directly or indirectly on these natural water storage facilities for drinking water, agriculture, industry and power generation."" ""There are many canaries emerging in the climate change coal mine,"" Steiner added. ""The glaciers are perhaps among those making the most noise."" In the future, Meuli says the University hopes to produce features that can be used by teachers in preparation for taking classes to the glaciers.","New iPhone app is helping visitors to Swiss Alps understand glacier melt .

"(CNN)  -- It cannot be denied that African-Americans have made tremendous progress -- and one of the most significant factors that contributed to black success and survival has been our faith in God. The manifestation of that faith is the religious community, which consists mostly of Christian churches that have produced positive spiritual, social, economic and political results for black America. The question is whether black churches can continue to be the instruments of empowerment that they historically have been. Perhaps an understanding of the emergence and prominence of the African- American church will offer some insight to the potential that these churches still possess. Eighty-seven percent of African-Americans report they are affiliated with a particular religious group, and 95 percent of those claim to be Christians, according to the 2007 U.S. Religious Landscape Study conducted by the Pew Research Center. Belief in God, regular prayer, worship attendance and belief in life after death are some of the core beliefs of a large majority of African-Americans. Although the expressions of faith and religious practices might differ, religious faith itself is a constant in black America. The African-American religious experience is a result of a convergence of African culture, biblical hermeneutic and social resistance, woven into institutions. The common threads among the culturally diverse African slaves in North America were communal living, extended families, cultural leadership and a deeply rooted appreciation for spirituality. Enslaved Africans were exposed to the literature of the Christian Bible, and they found comfort and direction in the same book that was used to justify their enslavement. Slaves met the indignities and injustices that denied them their humanity with the same resistance that humans throughout history have shown oppression. Religion in general and Christianity in particular became an answer to the mysteries of the cosmos and a way to cope: Only a belief in an unseen power and a faith in a divine advocate could sustain a people who faced such daunting circumstances. When the highest court in the land relegates one's race to subhuman status as a matter of law -- which the Supreme Court did in the Dred Scott decision of 1857 -- people need a source of authenticity for their identity. That source for African-Americans was the God of the Bible, who had sent Moses to lead the slaves out of slavery and who had sent his son to preach ""good news to the poor and set the captives free."" But that cultural background within Christianity translated into an ecclesiology that not only nurtured the development of the black churches, but also conferred upon black clergy a status that has been akin to royalty. Although the role of professional clergy in the Protestant church at large was viewed as a vocation, African-Americans tended to treat their clergy as more than just employees of the church --  they were royal tribal leaders for the community. So the separation between the sacred and the secular, the religious and the political, has not been as distinct among African- Americans. The clergy had to be advocates for justice, arbiters of internal disputes within the community and managers of sacramental affairs, all in one. And the churches themselves had to be more than places to learn about and worship God. In a segregated society, church was the place where people fulfilled their human potential, developed their God-given talents, made corporate decisions, voted for their officers, owned property, created benevolent societies, raised money for schools and scholarships, celebrated their marriages, blessed their babies, mourned their loved ones' deaths and even learned how to read. When states passed laws making it illegal to teach black people to read, many learned in church. Even people with little faith had great respect and admiration for the church, if for no other reason than it was a  ""surrogate world"" for black people, as E. Franklin Frazier noted in his book, ""The Negro Church in America,"" in 1963. The worship styles, doctrinal distinctions and organizational structures are so diverse that it is really a misnomer to refer to ""the"" black church. Many black churches make up the black religious experience. What is irrefutable is that without a deep and authentic faith and a passion for the institutional development of that faith, African-Americans could have never sustained the fortitude necessary to survive and succeed in the American experience. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the Rev. DeForest Soaries, Jr.","DeForest Soaries: Churches helped blacks' political, cultural, spiritual progress .
Slaves found, in the Bible, a means to cope with dire circumstances, he writes .
More than place of a worship, Soaries says. People fulfilled potential there .

"New York (CNN) -- In 2007, I co-founded FEED Projects with my business partner, Lauren Bush, to help address the problem of global malnutrition. Bush had designed the first FEED bag, which provides school meals to children through the U.N. World Food Program, where I was working. We have since sold more than half a million bags around the world and donated close to $6 million to provide more than 55 million school meals to children and raise awareness about a crucial humanitarian issue. But here at home in America, it's hard not to notice a different food-related problem: obesity. It's affecting everyone, from small children to the elderly, and it's growing. As an anti-hunger advocate, I found the perplexity of the obesity problem and the hunger problem existing side-by-side in our increasingly global food system begged further investigation. Read an interview with Ellen Gustafson at TED.com . About 30 years ago, a few key things happened that changed American and global agriculture. First, our farms consolidated after the oil crisis of the 1970s and focused more on growing highly subsidized commodities such as corn, soy and wheat. Concurrently, we began to cut international agriculture development aid. Since 1980, U.S. development aid for African farmers has fallen by 85 percent. With American farmers producing lots of excess corn, soy and wheat and farmers in the poorest parts of the world receiving less support, the way we've eaten here and around the world has changed in the past 30 years. Today, 75 percent of food products in supermarkets and fast food outlets contain corn, soy or wheat. The introduction of high-fructose corn syrup, first widely used in 1980, as a new outlet for corn has led to a dramatic increase in soda consumption and to a whole range of cheap, sugary foods. Chicken McNuggets, introduced in 1980, were a harbinger of the increase in cheap meat, for which 80 percent of the U.S. corn crop is used as animal feed. Changes in food consumption since 1980 have directly led to changes in our global waistline, so that today 1.6 billion people on the planet are overweight. That's a threefold increase since 1980, according to WHO, with projections of 2.3 billion adults overweight by 2015. Learn about Jamie Oliver's anti-obesity project . The abundance of cheap food with low nutritional value in the Western diet has wreaked havoc on our health; in America, one third of children and two thirds of adults are overweight or obese and are more likely to develop diabetes and cardiovascular disease. But another one billion people on the planet are still hungry. Our systems that produce massive amounts of cheap food are not helping the regions of the world where small farmers still toil amidst more regular droughts and famines. The average number of food crises per year having doubled since 1980. Furthermore, our old food aid model, based on sending excess U.S. grain to persistently hungry populations, has not helped farmers around the world develop reliable systems to prevent hunger. That said, some aid organizations, such as the U.N. World Food Program and Heifer International, run programs to support poor farmers. And political support for agricultural development is building in Washington. Watch Dan Barber's talk on sustainable fish farming . Taking the wider view, obesity and hunger look like two sides of the same core problem: malnutrition because of a lack of access to nutritious foods. In light of the changes in the past 30 years -- which have led to one billion people overweight, one billion hungry and an imbalanced global agricultural system -- I created the 30 Project. It's a long-term campaign to address global food system issues. As a new campaign of the FEED Foundation, the 30 Project will raise awareness about the systemic underpinnings of hunger and obesity, align the activists on both fights toward long-term change and facilitate local and regional discussions of food system challenges. I have hope that if we take a 30-year view of the future, we can create a food system that addresses the needs and health of the planet and its growing population. Maybe we need to rethink regional food systems for every community, from Botswana to Boise to the South Bronx, so we can buy more fresh food in our local economies. Maybe we need to change the way we value the food we eat, so that a ""value meal"" is something we are proud to feed our children. Maybe we need to re-engage our smart, energetic youth around the world to be farmers and find fresh, green technologies that will feed the world more fresh greens. Maybe we should commit to a goal that every child, in every country, will have access to nutritious food in school that will nourish their bodies and their minds. To address our current food system problems, I propose a series of local, regional, national and global conversations -- starting around the dinner table -- to rethink the food we produce, buy and eat. A healthier agricultural system at home and abroad would produce healthier food options for all eaters. We can all vote with our food dollars every day for the health of ourselves, our families and the world. Now that we know the outcome of our past three decades of food production and consumption, let's start to change the system -- one bite at a time.

"BOSTON, Massachusetts (CNN) -- The U.S. Army says it will honor the ""heroism and sacrifice"" of 350 U.S. soldiers who were held as slaves by Nazi Germany during World War II. Bernard ""Jack"" Vogel died in a Nazi slave camp in the arms of fellow U.S. soldier, Anthony Acevedo, in 1945. The decision by the Army effectively reverses decades of silence about what the soldiers endured in the final months of the war in 1945 at Berga an der Elster, a subcamp of Buchenwald where soldiers were beaten, starved, killed and forced to work in tunnels to hide German equipment. More than 100 U.S. soldiers died in the camp or on a forced death march. Before they were sent back to the United States, survivors signed a secrecy document with the U.S. government to never speak about their captivity. ""The interests of American prisoners of war in the event of future wars, moreover, demand that the secrets of this war be vigorously safeguarded,"" the document says. CNN last month reported the story of Anthony Acevedo, who was a 20-year-old medic when he was sent to Berga with the other soldiers. Acevedo kept a diary that details the day-to-day events inside the camp and lists names and prisoner numbers of men as they died or were executed.  See inside Acevedo's diary » . That story prompted a chain of events, including hundreds of CNN.com users urging their congressional leaders to honor the soldiers of Berga. Two congressmen, Reps. Joe Baca, D-California, and Spencer Bachus, R-Alabama, wrote U.S. Army Secretary Peter Geren and asked him to recognize the 350 soldiers. The Army recently responded to the two congressmen, saying it is working ""to determine an appropriate way to honor the heroism and sacrifice of these soldiers. We expect this review to be complete by March 6, 2009."" After learning of the Army's decision, Baca said in a press release, ""The courage and perseverance they demonstrated in enduring such inhumane conditions is awe inspiring, and I am pleased the Army has opened a more extensive investigation into honoring these men."" For the dozen of Berga survivors who are still living, the news came as a shock. Many had long ago given up hope that their country would ever recognize them for what they endured. ""It's amazing,"" said Morty Brooks, now 83, when informed of the Army plans. ""It's a recognition that's many years past due. No particular notice was ever given to us by the government, and it should be part of the military's annals."" Acevedo, now 84, noted the ages of the remaining survivors -- all of whom are in their 80s. Some are in failing health. He said he hopes the Army can reach its decision before March, because of the possibility some could die before then. ""If they can do it a lot sooner, we would appreciate it much,"" he said. ""I thank God I'm still able to communicate and express myself with dignity, and I'm hoping the other fellas are able to communicate also. ""I've always been proud to be a U.S. soldier. It did me some good, with God's help and faith. I'll pray for everybody, all my other fellas."" He said the 350 soldiers are heroes who ""exposed our lives for our country, for democracy and freedom of speech."" The soldiers, all of them survivors of the Battle of the Bulge, had originally been sent to a POW camp known as Stalag IX-B in Bad Orb, Germany. From there, the Nazis separated the 350 soldiers based on being Jewish or ""looking like Jews"" and sent them to the slave camp around February 8, 1945. Watch Acevedo describe treatment in the camp » . In Boston, Martin Vogel sits quietly in his home. His brother, Bernard ""Jack"" Vogel, died in Acevedo's arms at the age of 19 in April 1945. Bernard Vogel had tried to escape from Berga with another soldier named Izzy Cohen. Both were captured and forced to stand in their underwear outside the barracks for at least two days until they collapsed. The last words Bernard Vogel ever uttered were ""I want to die, I want to die.""  Listen as Acevedo tells brother of victim: ""I held him in my arms"" » . Martin Vogel, 82, said that ""since learning of my brother's death in 1945, a week has not passed that I don't think of his untimely death. Many questions had gone unanswered during this time."" After talking with CNN.com and the few remaining survivors, he said, ""My thoughts have come into a clearer focus. I have learned of the last few days of [Bernard's] life and what horrendous event took place prior to death. This has at least crystallized the uncertainty of his death and brought a close to this chapter."" Vogel still gets emotional talking about his brother's death. He wrote his thoughts so he wouldn't cry talking about it. He continued, writing that questions remain on many issues, including the fate of his brother's captors and ""the unwillingness of the Army to publicly document the capture and imprisonment of these soldiers. ... The least is I now know Jack died with friends near him, giving him comfort in his last moments."" The two Berga commanders -- Erwin Metz and his superior, Hauptmann Ludwig Merz -- were tried for war crimes and initially sentenced to die by hanging. But the U.S. government commuted their death sentences in 1948, and both men were eventually set free in the 1950s. Charles Vogel, the uncle of Bernard and Martin, was outraged at the decision. At the time a powerful Manhattan attorney, he petitioned President Harry Truman, Secretary of State George Marshall and Defense Secretary James Forrestal to overturn the commutation. Charles Vogel also helped form a group called ""Berga Survivors"" after the war in which some of the slave camp soldiers would meet to discuss the best way to pressure the government to honor them and allow them to testify against Metz and Merz. In a bulletin from one of their meetings in early 1949, the ""Berga Survivors"" appeared optimistic the government would act. ""Your cooperation now is doubly important, for things are beginning to break our way,"" the bulletin says. ""A little enthusiasm, a little more cooperation, a little more action will accomplish a great, great deal now."" It adds, ""You can aid in the campaign to get Washington to procure full justice for us."" More than six decades later, it appears the work of the original ""Berga Survivors"" group was not in vain. Most have since died, but the few who remain alive say they will never let their fellow soldiers be forgotten. ""It's finally gotten to a point where the Army is coming to their senses after they had ignored us in the past,"" Acevedo said. ""Why the silence all these years? It's time to recognize all these soldiers who sacrificed their lives."" CNN.com has located 14 Berga soldiers who are alive and will keep working to find if any others are still living.","Surviving soldiers happy that recognition will finally come .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Sniffer dogs have long been a useful tool in the search for hidden drugs and explosives, but the future looks bleak for man's best friend as scientists seek to develop a new ultra-sensitive electronic nose device. New electronic nose could work just as well as the snouts on man's best friend, say researchers. The electronic nose will be able to identify tiny amounts of explosives in high-traffic, high-risk areas, like airports or shipping terminals, according to researchers. Yushan Yan, a chemical and environmental engineering professor at the University of California, Riverside, and his team are in charge of the project. They have just been awarded nearly $1 million in grants by the National Science Foundation to develop the nose, which they claim will work just as well, if not better, than sniffer dog snouts. ""The sensor we are developing certainly has many possible applications,"" Yan told CNN. ""There are many other scenarios you can imagine."" These include using the hand-held device for military operations to detect hazardous materials or even land mines, he said. They could also be particularly useful in baggage x-ray machines or placed near passenger metal detectors in screening areas, quickly ""breathing"" in samples of air as people and luggage pass through. And unlike its animal counterpart, the device won't get tired, need bathroom breaks or require food and water, Yan argues. ""[A dog] takes a lot of training and a person has to be with them all of the time. A dog doesn't work 7 days a week and maybe will get into a bad mood,"" he added. They say the device will be able to pick up a smell at extremely low concentrations ranging from parts per billion to parts per trillion and will be able to detect dozens of different odors. It will consist of an ultra-thin film made out of zeolite, a porous substance commonly used to refine petroleum. The special film will capture certain gas molecules, like those found in the explosive vapors of TNT. The molecules that are trapped on the membrane will interface with an ultra sensitive sensor array made of carbon nanotubes. Each sensor will generate a specific signal in the presence of different compounds. The signals will combine to form a unique pattern, or fingerprint, that will be identified by computer software as a specific scent -- just as a human nose can differentiate between the smell of an apple and an orange, the electronic one will recognize ammonia gas from that of benzene, said Yan. Over the past decade, ""electronic sensing"" or ""e-sensing"" technologies, that mimic human senses, have grown significantly, especially from a commercial perspective. They are used by companies to ""smell"" everything from beer and wine to spoiled food and medicine. The technology behind reproducing human sense will grow even further in coming years. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are currently creating a tiny electronic nose made out of a ceramic material that could also detect a range of gases, including hazardous ones like carbon monoxide. While scientists at Tufts University in Massachusetts are working on a smelling machine that uses strands of dried DNA to identity different scents. Coca-Cola has a smelling machine to analyze corn syrup, while scientists at Nestlé have designed one to sniff coffee aromas. Some cosmetic companies have even used them to smell flower fragrances for their perfumes. However, so far no one has developed an electronic snout that can quite compete with the complex and highly sensitive canine olfactory system. But former dog handler, Bill Heiser is not convinced. Heiser, from Florida, has a faithful black Labrador, Max, who worked in drug detection for years. For him nothing beats working with man's best friend. ""You get attached,"" Heiser told CNN. The most rewarding is you get a dog that literally sometimes has no name,"" ""The end result is he is happy go out and work because of his loyalty to you. Each dog has a different personality.""","Electronic nose to detect trace amounts of explosive compounds .

"KUNA YALA, Panama (CNN)  -- Hunched over a campfire in eastern Panama, Embera tribesman Raul Mezua chanted a song his grandfather taught him when he was a boy. Embera tribesman Raul Mezua sings traditional songs over a campfire in Panama. The words are memorized, passed down from an aging generation to a new group of tribal youths. ""The song means a lot to me,"" Mezua told CNN, the fire's dying embers splashing a red glow across his face. ""But I don't know what it means."" It's not just the song but their language and culture that Mezua and his tribe fear losing as deforestation from logging and cattle ranching threatens the rainforest that is part of their identity. But recent trends could usher in a welcome reversal for Mezua and his tribe. Rural workers are migrating toward cities in search of jobs, and forests are re-emerging where now abandoned farms and cattle ranches once flourished, according to a 2009 report from the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization.  Watch the struggle over Panama's rainforests » . Such ""secondary"" forests in the tropics can rapidly grow in areas once cleared for logging and cattle ranching if left alone, said Joseph Wright, senior scientist at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama. ""After about 20 years (of being left alone) the forest will be about 60 feet tall,"" he said. Deforestation and re-growth in Panama may reflect a snapshot of a bigger picture involving rainforests throughout Central America. With more than three-quarters of people across the region now living in urban centers, the United Nations expects rural farming and population growth -- the usual culprits behind deforestation -- to dwindle. Some call forest re-growth a victory in the climate crisis. Trees consume carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that traps heat within the Earth's atmosphere. ""Biology is the only way we can remove carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere,"" Wright said. ""There's no way to do it faster than to let tropical forests re-grow on abandoned land."" Others say threats to primary forest, or original jungle, is the real issue and that its loss can cause irreparable damage to the surrounding ecosystem. ""Places in Colombia, places in Central America, places in Mexico, places in many of the Andean countries are the last bunkers, the last bastions of hundreds of unique species in each place,"" Lider Sucre, director of Panama's Museum of Biodiversity, told CNN. ""If you replant 10 times as much forest but you lose these last large pockets, you lose a huge amount of biodiversity forever and ever."" The value of primary and secondary forests is a debate heating up within the environmental community as new woodlands begin to wrap themselves around barbed-wire fences that still dot cattle-driven landscapes across Panama. ""We have to make that distinction, that fundamental difference, between re-growth and the original forest,"" Sucre said. ""Re-growth is only a shadow in terms of the diversity of life within it."" In places like Panama's Kuna Yala, a semi-autonomous tribal region and the country's largest tract of rainforest, new growth can bridge gaps between the remaining pockets of pristine old growth forest. ""Because of its size, because of the health of the entire ecosystem, it has an extraordinary potential to serve as a kind of a Noah's Ark -- a place that can safeguard biodiversity and the full complement of species,"" Sucre said. Recently, a scientific expedition unearthed 10 new amphibious species on both sides of Panama's mountainous border with Colombia, according to Conservation International, an environmental advocacy group based in Washington. At least 25 percent of the area is being deforested, putting the rich biodiversity in jeopardy, the group said. Across the region, the United Nations says tropical rainforest land is still being lost at an alarming pace. More than 7 million hectares of forests were destroyed globally each year between 2000 and 2005, the U.N. says.  See images of deforestation and tribal culture in Panama » . Slightly less than one-fifth of the world's carbon dioxide emissions stems from the effects of deforestation in poor countries, the U.N. said -- a figure comparable to the total output of the United States and China. For indigenous tribes -- who rely on the rainforest for everything from medicine and food to homes and artwork -- the reality behind the figures is staggering. ""The rainforest is something we depend on,"" Kuna tribesman Toniel Edman said, standing beside a thatched hut made from rainforest wood. ""The problem is actually with the farmers and ranchers,"" Edman said. ""They invade our land and deforest it for their own gain."" But here, cattle is king. ""We don't have another way to support ourselves,"" rancher Oriel Gonzalez said, overlooking cow pastures where rainforest once dominated. ""We go looking for work elsewhere but there isn't any. We don't know how to do anything else."" He added that loans for raising cows are just easier to come by than financing for crops or other livestock. ""It's partly tradition. The banker is used to lending money for cattle -- that's what he's always done,"" said Wright, the Smithsonian scientist.  See how the greenhouse effect works » . Wright noted that for lenders, there is inherently less risk with raising cattle. ""We have droughts. We have plagues of microbes. Plagues of insects. You can have a 100 percent loss with a row crop,"" he said. ""That just never happens with cattle. You can always get the cattle to market and sell them."" For lawmakers, striking a balance between preservation and the ""need for people to grow the land"" comes with ""difficulties,"" Panama President Martin Torrijos told CNN. Torrijos highlighted his country's recent successes in combating deforestation; Panama recorded drops in rainforest loss during the 2000 to 2005 period, the U.N. reported. But he also recognized a brewing conflict between indigenous tribes and the ranchers, farmers and loggers who encroach on tribal land. ""Every now and then, issues occur and we deal with it,"" Torrijos said. Part of the problem is ""unclear ownership of the land,"" said U.N. Forestry Officer Merilio Morell. ""By law, the indigenous own the comarca (tribal district). But exercising ownership is not easy,"" he said. ""They cannot patrol ever single meter of land ... and the borders aren't marked."" Scientists say efforts to promote carbon trading -- a process intended to get companies that exceed their allowed CO2 emissions to buy credits from groups that pollute less -- could provide the mechanism needed to slow deforestation. Earlier this month, delegates from donor and developing countries around the world met outside Panama City to address carbon trading amid the fallout from a global recession. Environmental consequences from the economic crunch are still uncertain. But U.N. projections show a growing global demand for rainforest products like fuel and timber. That demand could thwart the resurgence of the rainforest.","New trends could open door to reversal in deforestation for tribes .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Thai police want to arrest another Iranian allegedly behind the bombs in Bangkok, a fifth member of a group they say intended to strike Israeli diplomats. Authorities plan to seek a court warrant for Nikkhahfard Javad, a 52-year-old man who was seen leaving the Bangkok building where the first blast took place on Tuesday, Police Maj. Gen. Anuchai Lekbumrung said Friday. A Thai criminal court already has issued arrest warrants for four Iranians. The Bangkok blasts went off a day after a device attached to an Israeli Embassy van in New Delhi exploded, wounding four people. Another device, found on an embassy car in Tbilisi, Georgia's capital, was safety detonated. The Thai National Security Council has drawn a tentative link between the bombs in Bangkok and those in India and Georgia, saying the materials used in the explosive devices were similar. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has blamed Tehran for the attacks. But Iran has denied the accusation, saying that ""Israeli agents are often the perpetrators of such terrorist acts."" Indian police said Thursday that they have not established an Iranian tie to the New Delhi bombing. Thai authorities have said they are holding three Iranian suspects -- Saeid Moradi, 28, whose legs were blown off by his own bomb -- and Mohammad Hazaei, 42, who was taken into custody Tuesday at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport as he tried to board a plane to Malaysia. Masoud Sedaghatzadeh, 31, was arrested Wednesday by Malaysian authorities in Kuala Lumpur. All three face charges that include joint assembling of explosive devices, joint possession of explosive devices without permits and causing an explosion injuring other persons. Moradi also faces charges of attempted killing of state officials on duty and the intentional attempted killing of other persons. A fourth Iranian, a woman identified as Rohani Leila, remained at large. She is suspected of renting the house where the first device exploded, apparently by accident. Hezbollah, a Shiite Muslim group active in Lebanon that the United States views as a terrorist organization, has denied involvement in the bombs in Thailand, India and Georgia. ""We are not afraid to say that we had nothing to do with these explosions,"" Hassan Nasrallah, the head of Hezbollah, said in a televised address from an undisclosed location in Lebanon. Hezbollah has received financial and political assistance, as well as weapons and training, from Iran. Nasrallah denied that the anniversary of the death of a Hezbollah commander Imad Mugniyah in 2008 in an explosion in Damascus, Syria, had inspired the attacks -- a theory posited by some security analysts. Thai authorities have said that they do not believe Hezbollah is connected to the bombings in Bangkok. Last month, Thai authorities charged a Lebanese man they said they believed was a member of Hezbollah with possession of explosive materials. The police charged the man, Atris Hussein, after finding outside Bangkok ""initial chemical materials that could produce bombs."" The authorities said they believed Hussein was trying to attack spots in Bangkok popular with Western tourists. CNN's Jethro Mullen, Kevin Flower, Harmeet Singh and Josh Levs contributed to this report.","A Thai court has issued warrants for four Iranians in relation to bombings in Bangkok .

"(CNN) -- Thousands lined the streets on Friday as the body of Cpl. Nathan Cirillo began its final journey home. His death dominated international headlines this week both for its circumstances and the impression he left behind. Especially touching have been images of his dogs, unaware their master is never returning home. But the following account from what may have been the last person to speak directly to Cirillo, and tell him he was loved, is especially poignant. Attorney Barbara Winters was early for a meeting on Wednesday when she stopped at the National War Memorial in Ottawa, Ontario, to take a few photos. Two men in uniform solemnly stood guard. In an interview with CBC Radio on Thursday, she said she remembers remarking to herself what a beautiful October day it was. ""The sun had come out. It was a wonderful fall picture. I got two pictures straight on of these gentlemen standing in front of the cenotaph."" Moments later the beauty would dissolve into scenes of panic, chaos and mourning as shots were fired and one of those guards, Cirillo, was hit. Video from the scene just after the shooting shows gunman Michael Zehaf-Bibeau calmly returning to his illegally parked car on the roadside, holding what appears to be a weapon. It is believed Bibeau shot Cirillo and drove a short distance to the Parliament building, where he opened fire again. Bibeau was eventually killed by Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers. No one else was injured. Winters said she was already walking toward Spark Street when she heard the shots and found herself moving toward the sounds as other people ran away. Soon she found herself kneeling at Cirillo's side, along with a handful others. ""I think it's human nature to run towards somebody to help them,"" she said. Winters had served many years in the Naval reserve, part of that service as a medical assistant. Several people worked together in an attempt to save Cirillo's life, including a nurse and another corporal, Winters told interviewer Carol Off. Nearly breathless at times during the interview, Winters calmly detailed their various roles. But her voice caught and eventually broke as she described talking to Cirillo, telling him that he was loved, and that he was a brave man. ""Just think of what you were doing when this happened,"" she said she told him. ""Just think you were standing at the cenotaph. You were honoring others. Just think of how proud that will make your family. Your family must love you so much."" He never responded. An image of Winters and the others bent over Cirillo was captured by photographer Wayne Cuddington. But Winters said she kept speaking because she had once been in a coma, and although no one could tell, she could hear everything. ""I just repeated, repeated, repeated that he was a brave man, that he was a good man, that he was loved, that he was respected,"" she said. Off asked Winters what instinct prompted her to speak to him about love. She paused a moment before answering. ""I think you tell people when they're sick, or when they're ill, or when they're hurting that they're loved. Because everybody's loved,"" she said through tears, ""by somebody.""","Barbara Winters ran to help when she heard gunshots .

"(CNN) -- If the Syrian government falls, other countries in the region could suffer, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad told a Turkish news outlet Friday.

And perhaps with a domino effect will impact faraway countries as well,"" al-Assad said. ""The Arab states that have not supported the Syrian regime are those that are not independent actors but rather (act) under the guidance of foreign countries.""

He singled out the United States as a nation that has ""massacred millions"" in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya. He also criticized Turkey, saying Syria's neighbor ""has a hand in the blood flowing in Syria."" Al-Assad said he would welcome talks with his internal opponents. ""The only red line is about foreign intervention,"" he said. ""Any dialogue should include only Syrians. It should not include foreign intervention. We have no other red lines from this.

"(CNN) -- ""Gosh, I wanna be that guy again,"" Jeff Baxter would think when he remembered how it felt to be in shape. The 66-year-old teacher wasn't exactly accustomed to the extra pounds he was carrying around. He had been a marathoner before what he calls ""bad teacher habits"" crept into his life. As a high school teacher in Kansas City, Kansas, he often skipped breakfast and lunch because of his schedule. Then he would consume between 5,000 and 6,000 calories after 6 p.m. each night. ""I would come home ravenous,"" he said. ""I could eat a large can of peanuts and whole bag of licorice in one fell swoop."" He began to gain weight in his 40s, and the pounds piled on for the next 15 years. By the age of 62, Baxter was at his heaviest weight of 465 pounds. At 6-foot-4, his body mass index was 56.6.

Baxter knew he needed to make a serious change, but after several previous failed attempts at dieting he needed a lasting solution. So Baxter and his wife, Connie, began looking into weight-loss options. After a few months and several consultations, they decided on gastric sleeve surgery -- a restrictive operation that makes the stomach smaller. Baxter was hesitant. He feared he would only gain the weight back. But his daughter encouraged him to see the surgery as a tool, rather than an overnight solution. He had the procedure in January 2011. For two weeks before and after his surgery, he was on a clear liquid diet, which he says washed bad food cravings out of his system. Then he slowly began adding healthy foods into his diet. He added one new food per day, adhering to a schedule from his dietitian. Today, he typically eats oatmeal for breakfast, a turkey wrap for lunch and lean meats with vegetables for dinner. Combining smarter eating habits with regular exercise, Baxter lost 70 pounds in the first six months after his surgery. He walked every other day at first, and now he alternates between walking and running. ""When my children saw me for the first time, their jaws dropped,"" Baxter said. Teacher of the Year . The shock was even greater when he returned to school the following semester. ""My students were wowed,"" he said. Many of his students even joined him during his Sunday afternoon walks. ""We became each other's cheerleaders."" The support he received from his class and family perpetuated his momentum. By the spring of 2013, Baxter had lost an awe-inspiring 270 pounds. These days, he's proud to say he weighs around 180 pounds. ""I wake up in the morning and I think to myself, 'There is no way I am going to fit in those pants,'"" he says. Yet he takes the more pride in the energy he's gained than in the way he looks. ""It has resurrected my teaching career,"" he said. ""He's always been a great teacher,"" his wife, Connie, agrees. ""I just think he has more energy to do more with his talent."" Just three years after he was strongly considering retiring, Baxter's newfound zest for both life and teaching made him the 2014 Kansas Teacher of the Year. Now retirement isn't in his plans at all. ""I have a surge of joy for what I'm doing,"" he says. ""I'm up every day at 4:30 a.m.""","High school teacher Jeff Baxter was 465 pounds at his heaviest .

"(CNN) -- What will OK Go think of next? The band's creative videos have made use of treadmills, dominoes and optical illusions. In its latest, ""I Won't Let You Down,"" the foursome takes to the road -- and the sky -- thanks to camera-toting drones and some Segway-like Honda vehicles called UNI-CUBs. The video is nearing 3 million views on YouTube. Part of the idea came from a visit to Tokyo's Robot Restaurant, kind of a Medieval Times with robots. (""Girls in bikinis battle enormous Transformer-style robots, helped by Daft Punk-style storm troopers on Tron motorcycles,"" went the description of a TripAdvisor reviewer.) ""It was the best hour of my life,"" OK Go's Tim Nordwind told Billboard. The band worked with Japanese director Morihiro Harano to design the 5-minute-plus clip, which begins with the group on UNI-CUBs doing some leg moves and then rises high over a building lot while the band is joined by several -- and then dozens -- of umbrella-toting Japanese schoolgirls. (A choreographer named Airman handled the moves; Honda supplied the UNI-CUBs and some backing.) Eventually the proceedings moved to a warehouse for the conclusion, a colorful display -- like a stadium flip-card maneuver -- that includes pictures of the band members and a ""ribbon"" showing the title of the song. The last part took more than 50 tries and was shot at half-speed and then speeded up, the band members told Billboard. By this point, the drone camera was a half-mile up. The band's videos sometimes take months to come together, OK Go's Damian Kulash told HLN last month, and the day they debut is usually the quietest they've had in a while. To really find out what fans think, he adds, the band prefers touring: ""It's actually really nice to get out in front of people and feel the energy."" Still, the videos are part of a philosophy that tries to entertain as much as awe, Kulash told CNN in 2010. ""We make cool stuff,"" he said. ""We just think they're fun.""

"(RealSimple.com)  -- Make every day a good hair day with these tips for maintaining, styling, and genuinely appreciating the hair you have. Caring for normal hair . If your hair isn't dry or oily or damaged by chemical treatments, consider yourself lucky. ""Normal hair usually means a healthier scalp,"" says New York City hairstylist Julie Lin. Maintenance: You can wash your hair up to five times a week if needed. ""A basic shampoo and conditioner, even a two-in-one, is fine,"" says Marianne O'Donoghue, an associate professor of dermatology at Rush Medical Center, in Chicago. You don't want to disrupt the hair's natural balance by using products for dryness or an oily scalp. Styling: It's OK to blow-dry every time you wash, but use a heat-protection product and keep the dryer moving along the hair to avoid burning, says Johnny Lavoy, owner of the Moda Rey Salon & Spa, in West Hartford, Connecticut. Common misconception: If you have normal hair, it can't be damaged. In reality, normal hair should be treated as a fine washable, like lingerie or a cashmere sweater. What's to love: You can experiment with styling products -- which means you can pick something just because it smells good. Real Simple: How to wash your hair . RS picks for normal hair . • Joico Daily Care Balancing Shampoo delivers basic, gentle cleansing. • Warren Tricomi Protect Pre-Dry Calming Serum shields hair from the damaging effects of a blow-dryer or a flat or curling iron. • Infinium by L'Oréal Professionnel Hair Spray holds a style but keeps hair soft and touchable. Caring for dry hair . Sun, a dry climate, abuse from hot dryers and irons, and heredity can all contribute to dry hair. ""But as with your nails, which are also made of keratin, you can restore moisture to hair,"" says dermatologist Marianne O'Donoghue. Maintenance: Shampoo twice a week, using products containing moisturizing ingredients, like panthenol and ceramides. Condition after every shampoo. ""Hair can absorb only so much conditioner, so don't feel the need to slather it on,"" says Amanda B. Once a month, use a deep-conditioning mask. Styling: Try to minimize the use of hot styling tools. When you do blow- dry, straighten, or curl, apply a silicone-based cream or serum to tame frizz, promote shine, and shield the hair from heat. Common misconception: Clarifying shampoo makes dry hair look even drier. ""In fact, dry hair holds more product residue because it's more porous,"" says Barbara Eisenberg, a stylist at Sofia's Salon & Spa, in Boca Raton, Florida, so using a deep-cleansing shampoo once or twice a month lifts that heavy buildup and makes it shine like new. What's to love: You don't have to wash your hair as often. Real Simple: Complete hair care . RS picks for dry hair . • Marc Anthony Ultimate Moisture Replenishing Shampoo uses soy and shea butter to repair and hydrate. • Pureology HydraCure Intense Moisture Hair contains shea, mango, and avocado butters to deeply moisturize dry hair. • Ojon Shine & Protect Glossing Mist uses plant extracts to combat frizz. Caring for curly hair . If not treated with care, curly hair is prone to frizz. The trick is to keep it well conditioned and work with the curl, not against it. Maintenance: Curly hair tends to be drier than straight hair, so wash no more than twice a week, to let scalp oils hydrate hair naturally. ""Use a smoothing shampoo and conditioner to treat the cuticle and calm frizz,"" says New York City hairstylist Julie Lin. Styling: Dry your hair with a T-shirt or paper towels instead of a bath towel, which can cause frizz, says Jayson Morgan, style director at the Patrick McIvor Color Studio, in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Detangle hair with fingers or a wide-tooth comb, never a brush. And use a leave-in conditioning spray, which ""can also be misted on when the hair is dry to help the wave bounce back,"" says Amanda B., a Los Angeles--based hairstylist and colorist. Common misconception: Hair should be scrunched with the hands as it dries to enhance curls. Actually, scrunching disturbs the curl pattern and creates more frizz. Apply a product and either let the hair dry naturally or twist damp sections into the desired shape and let them air-dry completely. What's to love: Treat them right and your curls will be low-maintenance. Real Simple: Alternatives for beauty products . RS picks for curly hair . • Matrix Curl.life Shampoo cleanses without weighing hair down. • Nexxus Humectress Ultimate Moisturizing Conditioner hydrates and helps manage unruly hair. • Aveda Be Curly Curl Control lotion curls and adds moisture and shine. Caring for oily hair . Remember -- natural oils are beneficial, so don't entirely strip them for the sake of cleaner-looking hair. Maintenance: Wash oily hair daily with a mild, detergent-based shampoo. Concentrate on the roots. ""It's your scalp that's oily, not your hair,"" says Mitchell Barnes, co-owner of Carter-Barnes Hair Artisans, in Atlanta. Rinsing out the suds cleans the strands sufficiently. After you shampoo, use a light conditioner from midshaft to the ends. ""This allows you to detangle safely without breaking fragile, thinner hair,"" says dermatologist Marianne O'Donoghue. Styling: ""Because oil blocks the follicles, oily hair is usually fine hair,"" says salon owner Johnny Lavoy. Avoid silicone, heavy pomades, and creams and opt for an airy mousse, applying it at the roots to add fullness. Common misconception: Oily hair doesn't need to be conditioned. You must replace lost moisture with conditioner, especially if you shampoo every day. Apply only where needed, beginning at the ends. What's to love: You save money on styling products. Stick to the basics, like a volumizing mousse, and skip the masks, the creams, and the serums.Real Simple: Best drugstore beauty buys . RS picks for oily hair . • Frédéric Fekkai Apple Cider Clarifying Shampoo rids hair of buildup and impurities. • Dove Beautiful Care Conditioner helps maintain hair's moisture balance. • Garnier Fructis Style XXL Volume Thickening Mousse adds body and holds it in place. Caring for chemically treated hair . The chemicals used to color, relax, or straighten hair open up the hair shafts and make them more porous, so they're more prone to damage. Maintenance: Wait at least one day after coloring before you shampoo. ""The hair shafts need to repair themselves, and washing right after a dye job can remove the color slightly,"" says Lavoy. Use a shampoo for color-treated or damaged hair about three times a week and follow with a protein-based conditioner. African-American women should shampoo only about once a week and condition ""with a water-soluble conditioning oil,"" says salon owner Johnny Lavoy. Styling: Use a leave-in conditioner fortified with antioxidants and UV filters to protect chemically treated hair. A rich styling cream or hair oil is great for touching up relaxed hair and dry ends. ""Stay away from greasy, petroleum-based products, which just coat the hair and seal out moisture,"" says stylist Barbara Eisenberg. Common misconception: Chemically altering hair is a sure way to destroy it. Only consecutively applied chemical processes, such as bleaching and relaxing, will harm hair shafts beyond repair. What's to love: Relaxed hair is easier to style; colored hair feels thicker. RS picks for chemically-treated hair . • Pantene Pro-V Restoratives Breakage Defense Shampoo helps fill in the weak parts of each strand, making hair more resilient. • Redken Smooth Down Detangling Cream Leave-In Smoother conditions with macadamia oil to tame frizz. • Carol's Daughter Tui Hair Oil contains a botanical oil to add moisture and sheen to African-American hair.

"(CNN) -- There's no cure for Ebola. So why have some patients walked away healthy while others in the West died? Dr. Kent Brantly, Nancy Writebol and Dr. Rick Sacra all contracted the disease while working in Liberia -- and all survived. Spanish nurse's aide Teresa Romero Ramos got the virus while tending to stricken patients. She too lived. But like the patients above, Thomas Eric Duncan and Spanish priest Miguel Pajares also received treatment in the West. Yet they died. While there might not be a single, conclusive answer, a series of factors may contribute to survival. Early, high-quality treatment . This may be the most critical factor in beating Ebola. The survivors in the United States all have one thing in common -- they were rushed to two of the country's four hospitals that have been preparing for years to treat a highly infectious disease such as Ebola. Brantly and Writebol were successfully treated at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta; Sacra was released from the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha. Duncan didn't go to one of those four hospitals. He went to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas with a fever and told them he'd recently returned from Liberia. Yet the hospital initially sent him home with antibiotics. Then, after he returned to the hospital much more ill, two nurses became sick with the virus. They have since been moved to more specialized facilities such as Emory and the National Institutes of Health in Maryland. But that doesn't mean patients are doomed just because they go to a different hospital. ""Keep in mind that this is still a very deadly disease,"" said Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent. ""In West Africa, the mortality rates are above 60%. I think it is better in the United States. But they're not going to be zero, I think no matter where somebody is."" Spanish nurse's aide found to be Ebola-free in third test . Quick rehydration . After finding a hospital capable of treating Ebola, those who survive are usually rehydrated quickly. ""The most important care of patients with Ebola is to manage their fluids and electrolytes, to make sure that they don't get dehydrated,"" said Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""And that requires some meticulous attention to detail and aggressive rehydration in many cases."" And if an infected patient getting proper care normally has a strong immune system, the chance of surviving goes up. But what may seem basic in the United States can be difficult to come by in West Africa, where Ebola has already killed more than 4,500 people -- largely because access to health care is limited. Yet Nigeria has successfully eradicated Ebola from the country, the World Health Organization said Monday. Unlike in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone -- the combined epicenter of the oubreak -- all identified contacts in Nigeria were physically monitored every day for 21 days, WHO said. Plasma transfusions . Three Ebola patients -- Sacra, NBC cameraman Ashoka Mukpo and Texas nurse Nina Pham -- all received plasma donations from Brantly. And all three have survived. The theory is that Brantly's plasma contains the antibodies necessary to fight the virus. ""It's very fortunate that the three patients I've been able to donate to, they and I share the same blood type,"" Brantly told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""I'll keep doing it as much as it's needed, as much as I can."" There was some controversy about why Brantly didn't give plasma to Duncan. But the problem came down to blood type, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital said. WHO to review Ebola response amid criticism of its efforts . Experimental drugs . Medication that hasn't gone through clinical trials can be risky. But with a mortality rate of 50% in the current Ebola outbreak, a WHO panel said it is ethical to offer drugs to fight the virus -- even if their effectiveness or adverse effects are unknown. The experimental drugs at the center of this Ebola outbreak are ZMapp, Favipiravir, Brincidofovir and TKM-Ebola. Brantly and Writebol both took ZMapp, and both survived. But Pajares also took ZMapp, and he died. The director of Emory's Infectious Disease Unit cautioned against viewing ZMapp as a surefire cure. ""They are the very first individuals to have ever received this agent,"" Dr. Bruce Ribner said. ""There is no prior experience with it, and frankly, we do not know whether it helped them, whether it made no difference, or even, theoretically, if it delayed their recovery."" Spanish nurse's aide Teresa Romero Ramos took the anti-viral drug Favipiravir and also received antibodies from a survivor in West Africa. She is now free of the virus. In addition to getting a blood transfusion, Sacra received an experimental drug called TKM-Ebola, which the Food and Drug Administration recently approved for wider use. Duncan took a different untested drug, Brincidofovir. But he didn't receive it until six days after being admitted to the Texas hospital. Had he taken it earlier, the outcome might have been different. CNN's Al Goodman, Elizabeth Cohen, Faith Karimi and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","Three patients in the U.S. have received plasma from another survivor .
At least four in West survived after taking experimental drugs; two died .
Early treatment at specialized facilities for Ebola has netted positive results .
But mortality rate won't be zero ""no matter where somebody is,"" Dr. Sanjay Gupta says ."
"New York (CNN) -- The death of a New York college student during a fraternity ritual in Pennsylvania has been ruled a homicide, the coroner's office said Friday. Baruch College freshman Chun ""Michael"" Deng, 19, died in December of ""closed head injuries ... due to blunt force head trauma,"" said Mary Wallace of the Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, coroner's office. In a statement Friday, Baruch College said it ""supports the ongoing efforts of Monroe County law enforcement to hold responsible those involved in the tragic death."" The college had said Deng died while participating in an unsanctioned fraternity pledging event and that it has a ""zero tolerance policy regarding hazing."" Charges are expected in Deng's death, Monroe County District Attorney E. David Christine said in December. More than 30 members of Pi Delta Psi were conducting a ritual outdoors for new pledges called the ""glass ceiling,"" according to a probable cause affidavit obtained by CNN. The objective was for Deng, who was blindfolded and wearing a backpack filled with a 20-pound bag of sand, to navigate toward someone who was calling for him ""while other fraternity brothers physically prevent that from happening,"" witnesses said, according to the affidavit. Deng fell backward, struck his head and was unconscious and unresponsive immediately after he fell, the document states. Pi Delta Psi Fraternity Inc. said after Deng's death that it had ""revoked and terminated all affiliation with the Baruch Colony,"" as the fraternity is known.","Chun ""Michael"" Deng died of ""closed head injuries,"" coroner's office says .

"London (CNN) -- In his highly anticipated counterterrorism speech last month, U.S. President Barack Obama publicly acknowledged -- for the first time -- the human toll that drone attacks inflict on Muslim civilians. ""It is a hard fact that U.S. strikes have resulted in civilian casualties,"" he admitted, adding, ""These deaths will haunt us."" While he pledged to curtail the use of drone strikes in the future, those words rang hollow when he went on to reaffirm his commitment to the targeted killings because, in his view, any alternative would invite far more civilian casualties. Obama's drone calculus ignores the CIA's warning about the continuing ""possibilities of blowback."" Officials in Washington ignore the high-cost ways in which the U.S. ""war on terror"" and the use of tactics such as drone strikes fuel the fires of home-grown radicalization in Western societies. This is a rising phenomenon that has not been seriously debated, despite a string of high-profile attacks. While trials have yet to take place, the Woolwich attack in London and the Boston Marathon bombings are suspected to be the latest cases in point. In case after case over the past few years, attackers and would-be attackers have cited the war on terror, first in Iraq and now in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia and elsewhere as proof that the West is at war with Islam. The presence of Western boots in Muslim lands and the continuing use of drone strikes have triggered a backlash among scores of deluded young Muslims who live in America and Europe, and who come from different educational and class background, including high achievers. What is surprising is that these attackers are not unified by a core set of ideological beliefs, or a belonging to a particular terrorist group, but by a core set of grievances, real or imagined. These are a different set of terrorists, in that they radicalized themselves -- enraged by specific grievances, while also having been integrated into life in Western society. Falling under the influence of militant preachers mostly online, they have internalized the kind of religious-political worldview that justified their taking matters into their own hands -- in short, a license to kill. Instead of trying to dismiss how the manner in which the US ""war on terror"" has been waged has motivated these angry, deluded young men to kill, it behooves us to take stock of their voices and to understand the drivers behind this pattern of violent rage. The goal is not to rationalize or justify their murders but to make sense of their violent actions. Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, for example, allegedly left a note claiming responsibility for the April attack, describing it as retribution for U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The purported message was handwritten on the interior wall of the boat where he hid from authorities, bleeding from gunshot wounds. In the note, Tsarnaev is said to have described the bombing victims as ""collateral damage"": ""When you attack one Muslim, you attack all Muslims,"" Tsarnaev wrote. He described his brother Tamerlan, who died in a shootout with police, as a martyr. And after his Times Square bombing attempt, Faisal Shahzad -- who held a master's degree in business administration and who seemed fully integrated into American life - reportedly told investigators that he acted out of anger over the CIA's Predator strikes in Pakistan, especially a drone attack that took place while he was visiting the country. Asked later by U.S. District Judge Miriam Cedarbaun whether he was sure he wanted to plead guilty, Shahzad replied that he wanted ""to plead guilty 100 times because unless the United States pulls out of Afghanistan and Iraq, until they stop drone strikes in Somalia, Pakistan and Yemen and stop attacking Muslim lands, we will attack the United States and be out to get them."" Pressed by the judge to explain his motivations, Shahzad answered: ""I consider myself a Mujahedeen and a Muslim soldier,"" he said. Asked by Cedarbaum whether he understood that children and other innocents might have been among his victims, Shahzad was unapologetic. ""They don't see the drones killing children in Afghanistan,"" he said. ""It's a war and I'm a part of it."" Shahzad is not unique. Najibullah Zazi, who pleaded guilty to plotting to detonate a bomb in the New York subway, is also an example of bottom-up radicalization. Like Shahzad, Zazi told the court that in August 2008 he decided to go with friends to Pakistan to join the Taliban in fighting the United States' invasion of Afghanistan. He went to the Taliban, not the other way around, and while in Pakistan he was persuaded by al Qaeda operatives to return to America to be a suicide bomber. ""I would sacrifice myself to bring attention to what the United States was doing to civilians in Afghanistan by sacrificing my soul for the sake of saving their souls,"" Zazi told the court. Likewise, the Pakistani-born suspect charged in an alleged plot to blow up the Washington subway system in October 2010 came to the FBI's attention because he had asked people about ways to fight U.S. troops in Afghanistan and Pakistan, according to unsealed court records. Farooque Ahmed, a 34-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen, reportedly hoped to journey to his native country and to fight there. The Taliban and al Qaeda did not recruit him. Ahmed, an engineer with a bachelor's degree from the City College of New York, was supposedly radicalized by the conflict in Afghanistan-Pakistan. His ultimate goal, according to an FBI affidavit, was ""traveling to Afghanistan to fight and kill Americans."" Similarly, the Sweden suicide bomber, Taimour Abdulwahab al-Abdaly, who blew himself up in Stockholm, studied in Britain and was married with three children. Al-Abdaly's friends paint a picture of man who enjoyed basketball and a good party, yet who had become increasingly angry over the past few years. His Facebook wall posts give a hint of his gradual radicalization. One shows a blindfolded Iraqi man being taunted and abused by U.S. soldiers. Several more are part of a series on ""Russia war crimes in Chechnya."" According to the New York Times, al-Abdaly sent an audio recording to Swedish authorities minutes before the explosions warning his actions would ""speak for themselves."" ""Now, your children -- daughters and sisters -- will die like our brothers and sisters and children die,"" The Times reported. ""As long as you do not end your war against Islam and the insult against the prophet and your stupid support for that pig Vilks"" (Sweden has about 500 signals intelligence specialists in the NATO force in Afghanistan). As a round-up of these violent voices show, home-grown extremism is a phenomenon driven by identity politics, a blowback against what they see as the U.S. ""war on terror"" in Muslim countries, a war that kills more civilians than al Qaeda operators. In this sense, the fight disproportionately inflames anti-Western sentiments and creates more terrorists at home. According to a 2006 Pew poll, the U.S. ""War on Terror"" is very unpopular among Muslims in Europe, with 83% of Muslims in Spain opposed, 78% in France, 77% in Britain, and 62% in Germany. Three years later, a survey of British Muslims for the BBC showed that 75% said it was wrong for the ""West"" to intervene militarily in Pakistan and Afghanistan, though a majority of respondents -- 78% -- said they opposed Taliban attacks against Western troops there. In his national security address, Obama hinted that the U.S. might begin to bring a closure to the ""war on terror"". With al Qaeda's core now ""on the path to defeat,"" he argued, ""this war, like all wars, must end."" Although Obama did not go far enough by suspending drone strikes, his scaling back of the targeted killing and recommitting to closing the prison at GuantÃ¡namo Bay, Cuba, are steps in the right direction. The importance of Obama's speech lies in educating the nation about the diminishing terrorist threat. One would hope that the president would level with Americans about the limits and costs of force in international affairs. Terrorism cannot be eradicated by pushing a button, as in drone attacks, or even military intervention that might cause a backlash that spurs more, not less, terrorism. Deescalating the ""war on terror"" by halting the questionable use of tactics such as drone attacks might not bring an end to home-grown radicalization. But it could go a long way to deactivating the cultural and religious minefields that entrap disillusioned Muslim teens and spur some of them down a violent path. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Fawaz A. Gerges.","President Obama acknowledged -- for first time -- human toll of drone attacks .

"(CNN) -- It's the festival that launched Foursquare and popularized Twitter. So even if you've never heard of the SXSW Interactive festival (it's short for ""South by Southwest,"" but if you want to be completely beyond hip, you can call it ""South by""), your geek-tuned ears should perk up for some big tech news this week as this conference gets under way in Austin, Texas. The Web, apps, social media and tech start-ups have traditionally been the themes of this conference, which kicks off Friday. In addition to being a launchpad for new sites and apps, however, SXSW Interactive is all about big ideas in technology: Where are we going, why, and how will we get there? Here's our best stab at the ideas and trends that will pick up steam this year at SXSWi. Of course, all predictions are subject to change. And before we get there, a shameless plug: Check our SXSWi blog for continuous coverage from Austin. Also follow @cnntech, @markmilian,  @jdsutter and @griggsbrandon on Twitter for nano-sized updates. 'Second-screen' apps . Smartphones and the internet have rewired our brains to the point that paying attention to one thing at a time seems way too boring. Cue the rise of smartphone and tablet apps designed to provide a ""second-screen"" experience while you're watching television. It's common knowledge that people tweet their way through the Oscars and use Facebook to discuss their favorite sitcoms in real time. But a host of apps are emerging to take these second-screen experiences to a new level. The ""Backstage Pass"" app for the Academy Awards, for example, let iPad users choose which video feeds they wanted to watch. Instead of focusing on the red carpet, for example, viewers could choose to hang with the paparazzi or in the celebrity champagne room. Others are trying to sync their apps to live TV programming, using the microphones on tablets and smartphones. If your gadget listens to the TV while you watch, it can offer up quizzes, trivia and ads that are tied to what's going on in the show at that very moment. Localized group texting . Texting? Yes, texting -- but with a 2011 twist. If Facebook and Twitter were all about expanding a person's online social network, think of group texting as an effort to rein things back in. An app called GroupMe -- already a pre-SXSWi darling with tech bloggers -- integrates with Foursquare to let you have private text message chats with all of your friends who are close by. Another, Beluga, which was recently acquired by Facebook, lets users start private text message conversations with small groups of friends. Extreme use case: You're throwing a last-minute party, but your apartment isn't large enough to host all 2,000 of your Twitter-follower friends. Beyond Facebook . Continuing with this trend of Facebook not being the end-all-be-all of social networking, expect non-Facebook social networks and apps to get plenty of buzz at SXSWi. None of these are likely to try to unseat Facebook as the world's dominant online social network, but some are worthy supplements. Instagram, a photo-sharing app, is one hot example. It lets users apply all kinds of retro-looking, hipster filters to their smartphone photos and then share them instantly on Twitter, Flickr, Tumblr, Facebook and Foursquare. Other social networky apps and sites focus on other features Facebook either lacks or hasn't mastered just yet: Quora focuses on answering questions; Path is designed for groups of 50 friends or fewer; and Foodspotting is a social network that's fixated completely on the idea of foodie restaurant pics. Taming the internet . The internet is a crazy-overwhelming place. As Farhad Manjoo writes in The New York Times, the personal computer ""has become one of the most distracting machines ever invented."" Expect at least a few Web gurus at SXSWi to push the idea of ""content curation,"" meaning they're out to answer this question: How can we make interesting and relevant information rise to the top of the internet, where users can access it quickly and without stress, rather than forcing them to swim through an ocean of Charlie Sheen tweets just to find what they are looking for? Google, Bing, Facebook and the like obviously have a hand in this. But some up-and-comers -- a la Instapaper -- may dominate this space at SXSWi. Is technology making us happier? Traditionally, SXSWi has been a clubhouse for the digital utopian crowd -- the bike-riding, glasses-wearing, cardigan-snuggling folk who think technology is saving the world, or is going to really soon. But, based on a the SXSWi panel list, expect this year's festival to also give rise to a healthy bit of skepticism about what tech is doing to us. Are smartphones making us scattered? Is Facebook actually improving friendship? Does any useful info come across Twitter? As these technologies go from the stuff of early adopters to mass-market phenomena, look for the tech elite to start asking these kinds of questions and providing some solutions -- probably by using more technology.","The South by Southwest Interactive festival starts Friday .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Actor Jeff Conaway, who was in the TV series ""Taxi"" and the movie ""Grease,"" died Friday morning, his manager said. While pneumonia was the cause of death, the doctor who treated him for drug addiction for years says it was his dependence on prescription painkillers that eventually cost him his life. ""Jeff was a severe, severe opiate addict with chronic pain, one of the most serious and dangerous combination of problems you could possibly interact with,"" Dr. Drew Pinsky said during a taping for Friday night's ""Dr. Drew"" on HLN. ""The pain seemed to be motivating him back to the opiates, and I told him for years that it was going to kill him,"" Pinsky said. Conaway, 60, suffered from pneumonia and sepsis in recent weeks and had been in a medically-induced coma in an Encino, California, hospital for two weeks, manager Phil Brock said.

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan hailed the passage of a wide-ranging package of constitutional amendments as a ""milestone for democracy"" after voters approved the measures in a Sunday referendum. In a resounding victory for Erdogan and his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), voters approved the 26 amendments by a wide margin Sunday. The country's current constitution was enacted after a military coup that took place on September 12, 1980, 30 years to the day before Sunday's vote. ""Our nation has said from now on, we go forward,"" Erdogan told supporters Sunday night. ""Yes to freedom. Yes to rule of law. No to the law of the rulers. The tutelage of the coup regime is over."" But with more than 96 percent of the votes counted, 58 percent of voters favored the referendum, while 42 percent were opposed, Turkey's electoral board reported. More coverage at CNN Turk . The proposed amendments include articles that would allow collective bargaining for public sector workers and affirmative action measures for women. But when asked what was the most important achievement of the reform package, a senior Erdogan adviser made it clear that the main goal was to overhaul the country's judiciary. The proposed reforms include amendments to the judicial system, curbs on the power of military courts and an article abolishing the immunity currently enjoyed by the leaders of the 1980 coup. Other measures would guarantee gender equality and put in place measures to protect children, the elderly and the disabled. One of the amendments increases the number of judges on Turkey's highest court from 11 to 17. It also grants the parliament, which is controlled by Erdogan's party, the power to appoint several judges. The senior Erdogan adviser, who who requested anonymity because he is not authorized to speak with the media, told CNN the package would ""break the caste system of the judiciary."" In his victory speech, Erdogan apologized to political rivals he insulted during a bruising and divisive campaign in the run-up to Sunday's vote. But to thunderous applause, he announced, ""We are going to free the judiciary from an ideological abyss."" Opponents argued that the amendments would further undermine the secular foundations on which modern Turkey was established in 1923, giving the prime minister too much power over the judiciary and making him a ""modern-day sultan."" Berhan Simsek, head of the main opposition CHP's Istanbul branch, told CNN that by packaging the judicial changes with less controversial proposals, the AKP had ""coated a poisonous pill with chocolate."" ""This will put all the branches of government into one man's hand,"" Simsek said. ""It will be one-man rule, like Saddam Hussein, or the Fuhrer."" And Hasan Gerceker, the head of Turkey's Supreme Court of Appeals, this week warned that the changes would politicize the judiciary. But Erdogan said the amendments would bring greater freedom and democracy. ""Can there be anything wiser and more meaningful than going from a coup constitution to the constitution of the people?"" Erdogan told CNN last week. Turkish lawmakers approved the package earlier this year, but not by the two-thirds majority necessary for the government to press ahead without a referendum. The measures have also been ratified by Turkish President Abdullah Gul, Erdogan's AKP ally. ""People have voted for amendments that signal a desire for change to an outdated system of government,"" said Asli Aydintasbas, a columnist with Turkey's Milliyet newspaper. ""Erdogan clearly has come out of this with a solid mandate. But I do hope he now abandons the harsh rhetoric he has been using during the electoral process and reach out to secularists and the Kurds."" Sunday's vote is the latest confrontation in a power struggle between Erdogan's Islamist-rooted party and Turkey's secularist establishment, which have repeatedly clashed since AKP swept to power eight years ago. The AKP narrowly avoided being banned from politics in 2008 when it was fined by the country's constitutional court -- one of the last bastions of secular opposition -- for alleged anti-secular activities. The court has also blocked legislation to lift a ban on Islamic headscarves at public universities. ""It started out as a referendum on constitutional reform package but it quickly developed into a confrontation between the government and the opposition. So it's really become a vote of confidence in the government,"" Istanbul-based journalist Andrew Finkel told CNN. Turkey's main Kurdish political party, the BDP, called on its supporters to boycott the vote altogether, saying their struggle for greater autonomy will continue whatever the result. ""Regardless of who wins, it won't stop the war,"" Mustafa Avci, the Istanbul co-chairman of the BDP, told CNN. ""The referendum does not recognize the rights of Kurds."" Tensions boiled over in downtown Istanbul on Friday when Kurdish activists attacked buses and police vehicles with stones, wounding at least one bystander. Erdogan insists he will do more to defuse the decades-old simmering conflict which has claimed thousands of lives -- but only after winning the referendum. CNN's Ivan Watson, Simon Hooper and Yesim Comert contributed to this report.","NEW: Erdogan hails passage as a ""milestone for democracy""

"(CNN) -- I don't want to write this. As part of breast cancer awareness month, a 40-year-old anchor had her first mammogram on morning television. And last week the anchor, Amy Robach, underwent a double mastectomy after announcing she had cancer, and saying -- in front of 5 million viewers -- that ""having a mammogram saved my life."" And I feel the obligation to point out that other possibilities are more likely. To understand why, you need to know how doctors now think about cancer: in terms of turtles, rabbits and birds. The goal is not to let any of the animals escape the barnyard pen to become deadly. But the turtles aren't going anywhere anyway. They are the indolent, nonlethal cancers. The rabbits are ready to hop out at any time. They are the potentially lethal cancers, cancers that might be stopped by early detection and treatment. Then there are the birds. Quite simply, they are already gone. They are the most aggressive cancers, the ones that have already spread by the time they are detectable, the ones that are beyond cure. Before I go through the other possibilities, let me be clear about something: I know Robach has been through an emotionally gut-wrenching month. I know she is worried about her children. I know her parents are worried about her. And I truly hope the mammogram served a purpose -- that it saved her life. It is understandable that any woman with a screening-detected cancer would want to believe this. But all women contemplating mammography should understand the other possibilities. One possibility is that it could not save a life, that the woman will ultimately die from her disease. Thankfully this possibility is the least likely. Yet in every trial of screening, some women die from breast cancer despite its being detected early. It's not the mammogram's fault, it's the bird's fault. The birds are the reason why the rate at which women present with metastatic breast cancer in the United States remains unchanged, despite three decades of widespread screening mammography. Another possibility is that early detection was unnecessary -- that she could have done just as well had her cancer progressed to the point she noticed a breast lump. Doctors are getting pretty good at dealing with rabbits. While the news media tends to focus on screening, the bigger story in breast cancer is the dramatic improvement in treatment over the last 20 years. Ironically, the better we are at treating breast cancer -- the less important it is to screen for it. The final possibility is that she was overdiagnosed -- diagnosed with a cancer that may not have been destined to ever bother her. Cancer biologists now recognize that small collections of abnormal cells may meet the pathological criteria for cancer, yet never progress to affect the patient. In other words, her cancer may have been a turtle: it may not have been going anywhere anyway. While doctors used to debate whether turtles really existed in breast cancer, now the debate is about how many turtles exist. Even the program that promotes screening mammography in the United Kingdom now acknowledges that women are three times more likely to be overdiagnosed than they are to have their ""life saved."" Some researchers think the overdiagnosed to lives-saved ratio is closer to 10 to 1. Others might argue it's considerably less. Overdiagnosis is notoriously difficult to quantify. But most agree overdiagnosis is more common than having your life saved. That nuance is lost in the powerful survivor stories that appear regularly in the media. Of course, everyone wants to interpret them as evidence of the benefit of mammograms. Unfortunately, the more likely interpretation is that they represent evidence of harm: unnecessary surgery, chemotherapy and/or radiation. Why is this important? Video images of individuals purported to be helped exaggerate the benefit of mammography, while hiding its harms. They impede efforts to balance the process, such as screening less frequently or starting later in life. And they give more weight to the idea that the way to deal with cancer is to find more of it. Why don't I want to write this? Because no one wants to dispute the interpretation of a well-meaning cancer patient who is trying to help people. And no one wants to make a difficult situation any harder. But news stories about health -- particularly on television -- are too driven by powerful personal anecdotes. The public deserves more nuance. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of H. Gilbert Welch .","Gilbert Welch: Amy Robach had double mastectomy when mammogram revealed cancer .
She says mammogram saved her life; he says that's not how it works. Cancers all different .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Two of the world's largest concrete pumps will depart the United States later this week as part of the effort to resolve the crisis at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, officials said. Each pump weighs 190,000 pounds and has a boom reach of over 227 feet, and can pump water and concrete at massive rates. They will be loaded aboard enormous Russian cargo jets Friday. The pumps' manufacturer, Putzmeister, said in a release the devices are normally used to pour concrete for bridges and high-rise construction projects, but can offer pinpoint accuracy ""to directly target hotspots within the reactors"" and help with cooling. There are only three such pumps in the world, said Putzmeister spokeswoman Mary Roberts. Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan issued an emergency order to obtain a similar, smaller pump in March, approximately one week after the March 11 magnitude-9.0 earthquake and subsequent tsunami struck Japan and damaged the Fukushima Daiichi plant. After the pump arrived and was used to successfully pump 150 tons of seawater into the plant's nuclear reactor spent-fuel pool, initiatives to bring the two larger devices to Japan began. Just last week, the U.S. Department of Energy was using one of the pumps at a mixed oxide fuel plant construction site on the Savannah River in southeastern Georgia. Georgia Department of Transportation Jill Goldberg said the agency issued a special permit for the gigantic pump to get it to Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. It arrived there Monday. The pumps are fully assembled and will remain so during the long journey to Japan, Roberts said. ""Since they're already assembled, that will mean no delay on the Japanese end on getting it to the plant,"" she said. Once each machine is loaded on board Russian Antonov An-124 planes, one pump will depart from Atlanta, while the other will depart from Los Angeles International Airport on Saturday morning. Two Putzmeister technicians are traveling with each pump to train the Japanese who will eventually be operating them, Roberts said. Previously, one of the pumps had been used to encase the nuclear reactor at Chernobyl with concrete after the 1986 nuclear accident in the former Soviet Union.","The pumps are being loaded Friday onto Russian cargo jets .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Political tensions in Thailand exploded into a major outbreak of violence this week as police opened fire on anti-government protesters near Bangkok. Thailand's capital has been at standstill during the past few weeks as the protesters seek to unseat a leadership -- led by Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva -- they say is illegitimate and undemocratic. The demonstrators support Thaksin Shinawatra, who was prime minister from 2001 to 2006, before he was ousted in a bloodless coup. After his removal, he continued to play a role in Thai politics -- even from outside of the Southeast Asian nation. What is the background to the current protests? Abhisit declared a state of emergency on April 7, hours after anti-government demonstrators (known as ""red shirts"" for the clothes they wear) stormed the country's parliament. Three days later, the deadliest clash in more than a decade between protesters (in this case the red shirts) and the military erupted, leading to the deaths of more than two dozen demonstrators and military forces. Media and analysts in Thailand say civil war may be looming, with another group called the ""multi-colored shirts"" emerging. They are displeased with the disruption caused by the red shirt protests. They are generally middle-class city dwellers. They are not pro- or anti-government, they simply want the government to shut down the reds to end the violence and interruptions to daily life. The red and multi-colored shirts have clashed in Silom Road, Bangkok's business and financial district. Meanwhile, Thailand's independent election commission has recommended the dissolution of Abhisit's Democrat Party after accusing the party of accepting an $8 million campaign donation from a private company and mishandling funds allocated to it by the commission. The ruling still must be reviewed by the country's attorney general's office and its Constitution Court. A democrat party spokesman maintains the party has fully complied with all laws concerning the uses of funds during the election campaign and the party says it will fight the recommendation. Haven't these protests been going on for a long time? Yes, Thailand has been embroiled in political chaos for years and many here are growing weary with the instability. Ever since Thaksin came to power, there have been protesters opposing his allegedly corrupt and autocratic rule. Those protesters donned yellow shirts (the color of the king) and occupied the two main airports in Bangkok, until finally the pro-Thaksin government was brought down by a court ruling. In revenge Thaksin's supporters copied the yellow shirt tactics and took to the streets in red shirts. Why do the sides divide on colors? It's an easy way for them to create an identity. It all started with the yellow shirts wearing a color associated with Monday, the day of the week that Thailand's revered king was born on. That was designed to show their allegiance to the king, and more broadly the traditional elite which has dominated Thai politics for years. Thaksin's supporters then picked a color to distinguish themselves from the yellow-shirts. Why are they arguing? Essentially this is a classic power struggle. It's easy to portray this as simply rich against poor, but it is much more complicated than that, as illustrated by the fact that the reds' leader is in fact a multi-billionaire. Thaksin rode to power by enacting populist policies which gained huge support from the rural poor. His radical approach ruffled a lot of feathers among the elite, who felt he was in danger of becoming too big for his boots, and could erode their position. The ""civil society"" also become concerned over allegations of corruption and his brutal war on drugs, which saw summary executions. He was also criticized for his heavy handed response to violence in the Muslim-dominated south. Finally the army decided to oust him in a coup, which had the backing of the aristocratic elite and much of the middle class, who were becoming uneasy with the cult of personality growing around Thaksin. That set the stage for an embittered power struggle, between Thaksin loyalists and those loyal to the army, aristocracy and their traditional Democrat Party. What are the wider implications of the protests? If the divisions in Thailand can't be healed it could lead to a deteriorating security situation which would have wider implications for the region. Thailand's relations with Cambodia are especially frosty since Thaksin was appointed economic adviser to Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen. The worst case scenario would see Cambodia drawn into the dispute, with Thaksin using the country as a political base, adding to the already considerable tensions on the border. So who is Thaksin? Visionary leader or venal despot: Opinions vary, like the color of the shirts his supporters and detractors wear. If you sport red, you think Thaksin was the only prime minister to offer the rural poor a voice and real benefits; if you wear yellow, you view him as akin to Ferdinand Marcos: greedy, self-serving and dangerous. What is not in dispute is that he won two elections, was the only Thai prime minister to serve a full-term in office and is still hugely popular. But critics say he bought his support and was only in politics to help himself. What is he accused of? In 2008 he was found guilty and sentenced in absentia to two years in prison for a land deal that enabled his wife to buy a valuable city plot for a fraction of its true value. The case currently being considered by the Supreme Court relates to the transfer of shares in his communications company Shin Corporation. The prosecution alleges he illegally transferred the shares to his family, who then sold them to the Singapore government's Temasek without paying tax. The court will also rule on whether Thaksin's government implemented policies that benefited his businesses, including a low interest loan from the Thai government to the Myanmar government to buy equipment from Shin Corp, a change in tax laws that benefited Shin Corp and changes to satellite laws that helped Shin Corp. What does Thaksin's defense team say? The defense team argues that neither Thaksin nor his wife owned the Shin Corp shares while he was prime minister, selling them to their son before he took office. It was their son who decided to sell Shin Corp to the Singaporeans. The defense also claims that the Assets Scrutiny Committee -- which has led the investigation in this case -- was politically motivated, having been appointed after the coup that ousted Thaksin, and therefore was biased against him. How much money is at stake? 76.6 billion baht (about $2.3 billion). That is the total value of his and his family's assets that are currently frozen in Thailand. But there is speculation that he has a great deal more money elsewhere. Why bother going after Thaksin when so many other Thai leaders have been perceived to be corrupt? Well, Thailand certainly has had a checkered history. But current Premier Abhisit Vejjajiva is widely believed to be honest and free from any taint of corruption. He wants to give the country a fresh start by showing no one is above the rule of law and that means ensuring Thaksin isn't allowed to get away with his alleged corruption, even though he is in exile. However, many analysts say this case is not just about corruption, but more about Thaksin's challenge to the Thai political elite that has ruled for decades. The theory goes that Thaksin was dangerously popular and refused to submit to powerful factions in the army, privy council and aristocracy -- hence the 2006 coup and the lengthy efforts to shut him down.

"(CNN) -- It's just days till Christmas, and many young girls around the world will be thrilled to find little dolls under the tree to play with. But there's new evidence that it's not only human girls who enjoy playing with imaginary babies -- young apes may be showing the same behavior. A research paper published Tuesday has found what its authors say is the first-ever evidence that young female chimpanzees in the wild ""play"" with sticks as if they are dolls. ""We find that juveniles tend to carry sticks in a manner suggestive of rudimentary doll play,"" they write in the current issue of Current Biology. ""And, as in children and captive monkeys, this behavior is more common in females than in males."" The team of researchers watched and logged the Kanyawara group of chimpanzees in the Kibale National Park in Uganda for more than a decade. They were surprised to see young female chimpanzees carrying around sticks, apparently mimicking the way that mothers in the group cared for their own infants. The behavior would go on for up to hours at a time. ""The juveniles carried pieces of bark, small logs or woody vine, with their hand or mouth, underarm or, most commonly, tucked between the abdomen and thigh,"" they wrote. ""Individuals carried sticks for periods of one minute to more than four hours during which they rested, walked, climbed, slept and fed as usual."" Co-authors Sonya Kahlenberg of Bates College and Richard Wrangham of Harvard University found that such behavior was witnessed only rarely among young male chimpanzees, pointing to the controversial idea that differences in play behavior even in other primate species may be gender-driven. Boy chimpanzees typically used sticks as weapons, shaking them to intimidate playmates. But just like human boys with ""action figures,"" young male chimpanzees were sometimes seen playing with dolls as well. Kahlenberg described one 4-year-old male named Kakama in an e-mail response: . ""He was observed to bring his stick into his nest and play the 'airplane game' with it, that is, he laid on his back with his arms and legs extended upward and balanced the stick on his upturned palms and 'flew' it from side to side. This behavior is performed by mother chimpanzees with their infants and, of course, human parents do it as well. Another interesting observation is that Kakama even constructed a separate nest for his stick."" It could be some combination of nature and nurture, as monkeys and apes have been observed playing with toys and dolls in captivity before, with previous studies showing an affinity for females to take on mothering role-play. ""Sex differences in juvenile stick-carrying did not result from females observing their mothers carrying sticks, since mothers never carried sticks,"" the study found. ""Instead, youngsters apparently learned socially from each other. Such juvenile traditions have previously been described only in humans."" So should this behavior in any way alter the way we perceive chimpanzees, and any affiliation with human behaviors? ""Regarding how this study is related to the sex difference that we see in how human children play, it has at the very least contributed to the discussion of the factors underlying these differences,"" Kahlenberg answered. ""Our results suggest that part of the explanation may lie in innate differences between males and females. Specifically, there may be differences in how the sexes play that shape how they interact with toys, including which types they prefer."" That finding would suggest there may be a genetic and gender-driven force behind the play. The behavior seemed to be a practice exercise for how to care for babies, with the chimpanzees often seen taking the sticks back to their nests and playing with them in the same way mothers did with real offspring. The authors say that the doll play may have evolved to help the animals learn how to be better mothers and caretakers.","Report in Current Biology: Behavior is more common in females than in males .

"(CNN) -- When you're a billionaire, you can make an almighty splash. Comanche, arguably the world's most hotly-anticipated yacht, has finally taken to the seas and for its billionaire owner Jim Clark, it's a chunk of money that could land him a place in the record books. The 100-foot monohull vessel is the brainchild of high-school drop-out Clark, who made his fortune in computer science -- co-founding Netscape and making timely investments in Apple, Facebook and Twitter. Clark, valued at $1.4 billion by Forbes, likens the project to ""building a Formula One car from scratch although hopefully not quite as expensive."" The sleek black and red vessel is at the very cutting edge of its sport with a top speed expected to approach the 40mph mark. ""I feel like an expectant father,"" says Clark, whose Australian wife Kristy is a model and television host. ""The whole thing when your child is about to be born, you just want it to be healthy. It's not unlike this. You're just praying the boat stays in one piece and that's a realistic fear with such a cutting-edge project like this."" The 70-year-old's appointed skipper is Ken Read, of North Sails, the world's leading sailmaker, who has overseen the project since its inception three years ago. Read, a two-time skipper for Dennis Conner's Stars and Stripes in the America's Cup, admits to sleepless nights in the build-up to its first foray on water. Clark likes to talk about how the team behind his creation ""is pushing the envelope"" with Comanche, which lends its origins in part to the yacht Speedboat, which was launched in 2008. Designed by Van Peteghem Lauriot Prevost (VPLP) and Guillame Verdier, Comanche's creation has been fast track, the build itself usually expected to take two years but, in this instance, crammed into just one with up to 40 workers on hand. Clark admits that his creation, ""lost value the moment it hit the water."" So why spend some of your personal fortune on what many people would label a vanity project? ""People spend money on sports and I just don't do golf, I hate it,"" says the 70-year-old. ""But I love sailing and the technology aspect."" Born and brought up in the arid landscape of Texas some way from the nearest coastline, Clark's background does not immediately lend itself to a nautical life. But he joined the Navy and, after three-and-a-half years on the ocean, it became a part of him. ""It was in the late 1980s that I bought my first sail boat and, from there, you always want to get something bigger,"" he says. ""Then you get to a point where you want to downsize."" Which is what he plans to do after Comanche. His other yacht, Athena, is currently moored in Monaco and up for sale at $75m. For now, Comanche, is the sole focus. The name is close to his heart. The last Comanche tribe chief Quanah Parker surrendered about 60 miles from where Clark grew up in an area where ""the plains are very flat like the ocean"". The primary goal, admits Clark, is ""to be a record breaker"" and he says, with a throaty laugh, that the boat ""will go really, really fast."" The target is to win such events as the Transatlantic, Transpac, Fastnet and Middle Sea while breaking records in the process, before selling Commanche in two years. As for the origins of it, there are two slightly differing tales. Clark tells the story of going out on the first Wild Oats, Bob Oatley's boat that has dominated the Sydney to Hobart race, and being blown away by the technology of a keel boat. There and then, the seed of an idea was planted. Read, meanwhile, adds: ""Jim and Kirsty are probably the two most competitive people I've ever met. They go to Australia each year for Christmas and obviously Sydney-Hobart is a massive deal out there. ""They've got friends that are boat owners and they got egged on by their buddies, almost like 'come and play with the big boys'."" It is befitting then that Comanche's first race should be Sydney-Hobart, although it is not without its perils. The 1998 edition of the race remains infamous for the freak weather conditions that struck and left six people dead. ""This is so cutting edge that we'll got into that race with lingering doubts it might go wrong,"" admits Read. ""Did we push it too far? Sure, there are sleepless nights and I would love to lower expectations. ""I wish Sydney-Hobart wasn't the first race, in fact you couldn't choose a worst race for our first race. It's like we've gone straight from the gym to the heavyweight championship of the world. And it could end up like an F1 car blowing its engine on its first outing on the track. ""And these are not inherently safe boats as they're built on the cutting edge. We just don't know."" Clark is hopeful, though, that Read and his crew of 21 can produce a knock-out blow and halt Wild Oats in its tracks as it bids for an eighth win in the 630-nautical-mile race that gets under way each year on Boxing Day (December 26.) The race is part of the Australian sporting psyche, on a par with the Melbourne Cup, the Australian Open tennis or an Ashes cricket Test match between Australia and England. For Read, Comanche and its crew, Sydney-Hobart will be something of a trip into the unknown but with the technology on board and money spent, Read is all too aware that the expectation will be high in subsequent races. ""We want records but we have to win the races first and then think about the records,"" he says. ""But to do that the conditions have to be right. You can have the greatest thing since sliced bread but you won't go record breaking if the weather's not right. But if we get into the record books -- and we believe we will - then it's job done."" Read does not lack for experience: a six-time J-24 world champion, twice U.S. yachtsman of the year and two-time skipper in the Volvo Ocean Race, and he is adamant the safety of his crew is of paramount importance. Read and the Clarks have become close friends during their time together, Clark's only regret as a septuagenarian is that he is no longer young enough to be on board in some of Comanche's tougher races. His bad ankles mean he will mostly be their leading cheerleader on shore with his two younger children, three-year-old Dylan and eight-week old Harper. ""My wife's an Australian and a very competitive lady,"" says Clark, ""and she wants to sail in Sydney-Hobart. I say 'we have the boat, do as you wish'. I'll let her run the show."" The record books are on the horizon.","Billionaire Jim Clark launches his multi-million dollar super yacht called Comanche .

"Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) -- A plane carrying tourists and others to a staging point for Mount Everest expeditions crashed Friday after striking an eagle on takeoff, killing all 19 people aboard, Nepali authorities said. The Sita Air flight from the Nepali capital of Kathmandu to the village of Lukla was carrying 16 passengers -- seven from the UK, five from China and four from Nepal -- in addition to the three-member crew, airline official Sameer Neupane said. The Dornier-built aircraft went down just two minutes after taking off from Kathmandu's international airport, China's state-run Xinhau news service reported Friday, citing Naryan Bastakoti, the deputy inspector general of Nepal Police at the airport. The plane crashed on the bank of the Maohara River in Bhaktapur District, Nepal's Civil Aviation Authority said. Images from the scene showed emergency workers surrounding the plane's charred remains, trying to extinguish flames. The flight was headed for Lukla, a village in northeastern Nepal that is the starting point for many expeditions to Mount Everest, the world's tallest peak. This is the high season for visitors to the Everest region. While the crash remains under investigation, it appears the plane's collision with a black eagle was a factor, according to Ratish Chandra Lal Suman, general manager of Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu. Officials have recovered the plane's flight data recorder, he said. The UK Foreign Office confirmed that seven British nationals were on the flight. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs also confirmed the death of five Chinese nationals. The Britons were booked on a trek with Sherpa Adventure Travels, said Sonam Sherpa, the manager of the trekking company. The 13-day hike would have taken the tourists to the base camp at Everest and back to Lukla, Sherpa said. A U.S.-based company, Explore Worldwide, also issued a statement Friday saying that the British tourists were customers of the company and that a member of the company's Nepalese staff was among those killed. It appeared that Explore had partnered with Sherpa Adventure Travels to conduct the trip. Plane crashes are not uncommon in Nepal. A small plane crashed in a mountainous area of the country in May, killing 15 of the 21 people on board. And a year ago, a plane returning to Kathmandu from a sightseeing tour hit a mountain and broke into pieces. All 19 passengers on board died, including two Americans. CNN's CY Xu in Beijing and Jethro Mullen in Hong Kong contributed to this report.","NEW: UK Foreign Office confirms the death of seven British nationals .

"(CNN) -- A ""miracle"" journey has propelled Gael Bigirimana from war-torn Burundi to soccer stardom in the English Premier League with Newcastle United. Separated from his mother as he fled to Uganda as a child, they were reunited later in the UK. And his big break may never have happened had she not sent him on a fateful trip to the shops to buy a pint of milk. His errand took him right past the training academy at third division club Coventry City, when he felt compelled to knock on the door and ask for a trial. ""I heard this small voice inside of me saying 'Go and play' and I thought, 'Okay.' I obeyed that voice,"" Bigirimana told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""I said a prayer: 'God, these guys don't know me, I don't know them and so everything I say to them just make them say yes -- even if they don't understand me just make them say yes, yes, yes!' "" The precocious boy, then aged 10, tapped youth coach Ray Gooding on the shoulder and asked if he could play. It was a meeting that would change Bigirimana's life forever. Gooding promised the kid -- who used to run to school to save paying the modest bus fare -- that he'd pop along next time he played in a match. Overjoyed, Bigirimana scurried home to tell his family -- but he didn't get far. ""I was really excited, then I started jogging, not even sprinting, just jogging with happiness,"" he explains. ""As I was jogging up the hill to go back home, they stopped me. They called me back and said 'Do you have your own equipment? Boots and stuff?' I didn't but I said yes and then they said, 'Come back tomorrow and start training.' ""They said they saw me running fast, like an athlete. That's where I believe God showed them something, like a glimpse of the future -- how I was going to turn out to be. ""God's favor has just been amazing -- going there, signing, playing for two years, I got moved up to the age above and everybody started becoming like a family at Coventry. Until now my life has just been extraordinary, a blessing."" When Gooding moved to join the academy at Newcastle United in the northeast of England, his new employers asked if there were any bright prospects at Coventry that might interest them. Although it would take four years to get his man, Bigirimana eventually signed with the club -- renowned for stars such as Alan Shearer and Paul Gascoigne -- for Â£1 million ($1.6 million) in July 2012. Now 19, he harbors the hopes and dreams of some of most passionate supporters in the country -- known as the Toon Army -- and is watched by billions of football-mad fans across the globe. In his first season at the club he featured against Premier League champions Manchester United, Arsenal, Manchester City and played in Newcastle's Europa League quarterfinal with Portuguese giants Benfica. He has also represented his adopted country at under-20 level. ""It's nothing but a miracle, where I've come from to be in this place,"" he said. ""If somebody told me two years ago or five years ago that I'd be here, I'd say 'You're crazy.' ""I believe that this is just a glimpse of what's going to happen in my life because there's more to come -- it's exciting. ""Newcastle as everyone knows is one of the big clubs in England and their history speaks for itself. The fans are just awesome and crazy, but good crazy. It's a nice place to be -- they're really supportive and love the club no matter what happens. ""It's a blessing to play for this club and I've heard people say how we used to be in the days of Peter Beardsley and Alan Shearer, that the stadium was electric. I want to experience that feeling. I want to be a part of the history of Newcastle in a team that's done something."" The pristine turf at St. James' Park is a world away from the dusty streets of Burundi where Bigirimana first cut his footballing teeth. Sharing the family home with his three siblings and extended family in the capital Bujumbura, when Bigirimana wasn't playing football he was watching it -- Spanish club Real Madrid catching his eye. ""It's tough sometimes but as far as I can remember it was good times for me,"" he says of his childhood. ""We didn't have boots or real footballs but we appreciated what we had. There was a good spirit, we didn't have a lot but we lived a good life to the maximum."" But with the specter of civil war growing, Bigirimana's family was about to be displaced as the relationship between the country's Hutu and Tutsi tribes fractured violently. The aftermath of the first multiparty elections since Burundi gained independence from Belgium in 1962 unleashed a wave of recriminations and uprooted thousands of people, with a civil war that lasted from 1993-2005. ""The war was the reason we moved to Uganda, so we kind of divided,"" Bigirimana explained. ""We got separated from my mum for four years but she rang us and she said, 'I'm in England and my plan is to bring you guys here.' She said the plan is to bring you here to have a good education. ""As a child (it was tough) but it worked out really well. It was tough but I just put my trust in God that He knows what He's doing and I will see my mum any time, any day."" The contrast between downtown Kampale in Uganda and a manufacturing city in the heart of England could not have been greater, but Bigirimana took it in his stride. ""I came to England and I don't know how to explain it, it was just cool,"" he said. ""Every African kid, their dream is to come to Europe or America -- in their head that's paradise. ""To get here, it's like everything will get sorted and you never get hungry. In my head I thought, 'Wow, I'm going to Europe, I'm going to play with white kids and I'm going to play football with a different lifestyle,' so it was very exciting. ""The reason I play football now is for my friends back in Africa and for all of the kids who were in my position when I was in Africa or who never thought I'd play in the Premier League. Yes I do miss them but I know that one day I will see them."" So what advice would the teenager offer to any youngster back in Burundi who dreams of becoming the next Gael Bigirimana? ""Never give up and never quit on yourself,"" he said. ""I believe everyone is here for a reason, even though sometimes we might not see it, but everyone here has got a plan to play, has got a place to play in this life. ""I always say to people, if they know a jigsaw game, every piece is important and every person in the world is just like a piece of jigsaw, we all have a place to be to feel free in our lives. You're special and you're here for a reason.""","Gael Bigirimana is embarking on a football career in one of the world's biggest stages .

"(CNN) -- It's been another difficult start to the season for Ferrari, but Formula One's most successful team is showing signs that it may yet be competitive this year. While Lewis Hamilton continued Mercedes' dominant form by topping the second practice session in Shanghai on Friday, Fernando Alonso followed up his leading time from the morning run by being second fastest in the afternoon. Watching was Ferrari's new team principal Marco Mattiacci, who has been tasked with restoring the ""Prancing Horse"" to winning ways. On his first visit to the F1 paddock ahead of Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix, the Italian emphasized his ""humility"" and the steady progress he hopes to make. ""I first need to prove I am at the level of Ferrari, and of Formula One, so you have in front of you an extremely motivated person,"" the 43-year-old told reporters. Alonso's teammate Kimi Raikkonen finished the practice sessions with the seventh fastest lap. He had completed only one lap in the day's first practice before spending the rest of the 90 minutes in the pits with a mechanical problem, but emerged to complete 25 laps in the later session. Hamilton, who has won the last two races in Malaysia and Bahrain, was just 0.014 seconds quicker than Alonso -- though the Englishman had problems with his car in the earlier session. His teammate Nico Rosberg, who won the season-opener in Australia when Hamilton failed to finish, was 0.411 seconds off the leading pace. Alonso, who is fourth in the overall standings despite no podium placings in three outings, said he was ""happy"" with the team's improved performance. ""At every race, all the teams bring something new and we must try and make an additional step forward if we want to be competitive,"" said the Spanish driver, who won last year's race in Shanghai. There were also encouraging signs today for last year's constructors' champions Red Bull. Their two drivers took fourth and fifth fastest laps with Daniel Ricciardo narrowly beating out four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel with a time of one minute and 38.811 seconds. Red revolution? Ferrari bosses have pinned their hopes on Mattiacci to rescue a season where the team's two star drivers have failed to reach the podium in the opening three races. He confirmed he was flown to Italy last Friday by Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo to discuss the position, and was hidden behind dark sunglasses despite overcast conditions in Shanghai to hide his weariness after a long week of traveling. Mattiacci has no previous experience in F1, and comes to the Scuderia from a previous position as president and CEO of Ferrari North America. He claimed that doubts about his pedigree are ""very motivating."" ""I am an extremely humble person who will listen, and will fight 150% to be a facilitator, to utilize the best talent in Ferrari,"" Mattiaci said. ""We have a history, a pedigree, that is unique, and a pride that is impressive, and we will react, but to talk about restructuring is too early."" All hands on deck . Di Montezemolo has said will be taking a more hands-on role while Mattiacci becomes accustomed to his new position. Former team principal Stefano Domenicali resigned on Monday, saying he took responsibility for the team's poor start to the season. With two-time world champion Alonso and 2007 titleholder Raikkonen in the stable, Ferrari had high hopes of breaking Red Bull's four-year dominance of the sport. But the team parted with Domenicali after the drivers finished the Bahrain Grand Prix in ninth and 10th positions. While the practice results offer hope that a change in fortunes could be close, Ferrari's engineering director Pat Fry urged caution. ""Even if we are making progress on all fronts, we are well aware that it's always hard to know where you stand on a Friday,"" he told reporters. ""Today's low temperatures affected tire performance and even if we can expect the track surface to be in better condition tomorrow, the rain expected for qualifying could turn the session into a real lottery.""

"(CNN) -- If you're scared of heights, then this is not for you. But for those who love an adrenaline buzz, then ""step into the void"" -- a suspended glass cube with a transparent bottom overlooking the Alps. But it's not for the fainthearted -- there's a drop of over 3,300 feet (1,000 meters). A rival to the London Shard, which stands at 1,017 feet (310 meters) and offers a 360-degree view of the city, it is the latest piece of architecture to attract thousands of tourists. Designed by Pierre-Yves Chays, the structure is inspired by ""The Skywalk,"" a huge glass walkway overlooking the Grand Canyon in the U.S. state of Arizona. Perched at the top of the 12,600-foot (3,842-meter) Aiguille du Midi peak near Chamonix, France, it gives a view of Mont Blanc which had previously only been attainable by skiing. ""I don't know if I can do it,"" were the first words to flash into the mind of Mathieu Dechavanne, the man who helped create the attraction. After three years of development, Compagnie Mont Blanc, the firm which operates the ski lifts and attractions in the area, has created a structure made from three layers of tempered glass which can withstand winds of up to 200 kilometers an hour. The stupendous view captures the highest peaks in France, Italy and Switzerland, as well as the biggest glaciers in Europe. ""The original idea was to create something even bigger to cross from one end to another,"" Dechavanne, general manager of Compagnie Mont Blanc, told CNN. ""One of the main conditions we had was that the design fitted in with the environment of the site. ""If that wasn't possible, we wanted to do something to allow the visitor to step into the shoes of a mountaineer. ""We wanted people to understand what was going on at altitude. From the void, you can see people climbing and making their way up the mountain. ""You can also try to climb if you want but if you want the sensation of what it's like at the top then try this transparent box and you can gain a real experience."" While the view may be enough to send shivers down the spine, the journey to the very top might leave a few feeling queasy. To get to the top, patrons must brave a cable car ride which takes them 8,858 feet (2,700 meters) up the side of the mountain. Once that's been completed, it's on board a second cable car for the final 4,790 feet (1,460 meters) to ascend to the peak. ""The view is fantastic,"" added Dechavanne. ""The beauty is that the void is beneath the feet but the impact on the brain comes from the transparency of the glass."" ""It's not like walking in the street, but this gives the impression to people of what it's like on the mountain."" To compare how ""The Void"" compares to other viewing structures around the world, Toronto's CN Tower -- named one of the modern world's Seven Wonders by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 1995 -- is 1,815 feet (553 meters) tall and its highest platform is at 1,465 feet (447 meters). It has since been overtaken by Shanghai's World Financial Center, which has an observation deck at 1,555 feet (474 meters), and Guangzhou's Canton Tower (1,601 feet, 488 meters). In 2012, the tallest hotel in the world was opened in Dubai -- the Marquis, standing at 1,164 feet (355 meters) tall -- while its owner Marriott recently unveiled its newest property in New York. The Residence Inn consists of 68 floors and stands at 750 feet (228 meters) -- making it the tallest hotel in the U.S.","""Step into the Void"" is a glass room built around a metal frame in mountains .

"(CNN) -- For most people, breaking one world record would suffice. But for Simone Origone, rewriting history a second time isn't quite enough. Last month, the Italian speed skier set a new world record of 252.4 kilometers per hour (156.8 miles per hour) on the slopes of Chabrieres in the French Alps, beating his previous best of 251.4 km/h (156.2 mph) set at Les Arcs in November 2006. Now, the 34-year-old is gearing up to go even faster. ""I have already started to plan my next world record, next year, same place,"" Origone told CNN. ""If the conditions are perfect -- temperature, wind, snow -- I can be as fast as 254 or 255 km/h (158.4 mph)."" He might be already masterminding his next world-record attempt, but Origone is still coming to terms with the magnitude of his record-breaking achievements. ""It was the best day of my life! To set a new record once is cool. But to do it twice is absolutely great. I'm really happy with that after waiting for eight years,"" said Origone. ""It's my passion for the sport. Speed skiing is my life. I spend hours in the gym and on the slopes, working on my technique. I try to improve my aerodynamics in the wind tunnel and then the mental aspect is absolutely key. Losing your focus for a split second can be fatal."" Born in the city of Aosta in 1979, Origone hails from a family with skiing in its blood. Younger brother Ivan, 27, is also one of the world's top speed skiers, setting a junior world record of 250.7 km/h (155.7 mph) in 2006, and also took part at Chabrieres last month. The older sibling first took to the slopes at the age of three under the tutelage of his father, an experienced coach, and made headway in downhill racing as a teenager before turning his hand to speed skiing in 2003 -- a sport that complimented his daredevil tendencies to a tee. ""It's a very strong feeling. After five seconds you're already at 200 km/h (124.2 mph) on a slope that is up to 98% steep -- that's amazing,"" he said. ""It's impossible to win a race if you're afraid. Certainly my body and mind tell me you shouldn't be doing this. But in order to be fast you have to overcome your fear and force yourself to go down there."" That need for speed will have Origone coming back to Chabrieres next April, when the Italian will be praying for perfect conditions to maximize his chances of breaking his own world record for the second time. ""It's all down to the conditions. The snow has to be perfect to break the world record. The latest record was only possible because we had spring snow in Vars (in Chabrieres). In the three previous years the snow conditions were different and a world record was impossible,"" he said. ""There's only one piste in the world that is long enough to break the world record (Vars). In order to reach over 200 km/h (124.2 mph) the piste has to be long, without bumps and have a long finish area."" From now until next April, though, Origone will return to the day job, where he can be found juggling the roles of ski instructor, mountain guide and rescuer. For all that two speed skiing world records might bring you, prize money is not one of the luxuries afforded. ""We don't have prize money in our sport, it's all about the passion,"" he said. ""You have to live for it. And I do.""","Simone Origone thrilled to break speed skiing world record by clocking 252.4 km/h .

"(CNN) -- Elena Bonner, the wife of late Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov who gained worldwide acclaim after smuggling her husband's writings out of exile, died Saturday in Boston, her daughter said in a statement. She was 88. Bonner's ashes are be interred at a Moscow cemetery next to her late husband's remains, said her daughter, Tatiana Yankelevich. Bonner's life revolved around the political struggles that characterized the Soviet Union in the 20th century. She joined forces with Sakharov in the early 1970's. Bonner was born in 1923 in Turkmenistan into a family of prominent Communist Party officials, according to a biography posted on Harvard University's website. Her father was killed in Stalin's purges during the ""Great Terror"" of the late 1930s, and her mother was interned in a gulag for 10 years. Bonner was twice wounded during World War II while serving as a nurse for the Soviet military. She became a physician after the war. She married Sakharov, known for his work on the development of the atomic bomb for the Soviet Union, in 1972, according to the Andrei Sakharov Foundation website. Following his work on the atomic bomb, Sakharov began publishing writings critical of Soviet politics. Bonner followed Sakharov into exile in Gorky, in western Russia, in 1980. She was permitted to take trips to Moscow, which enabled her to smuggle Sakharov's critical writings on the Soviet Union out of exile. Bonner was convicted of ""anti-Soviet agitation"" in 1984 for smuggling Sakharov's writings and lost her travel privileges to Moscow. She was confined to Gorky with her husband. Mikhail Gorbachev ended Bonner and Sakharov's exile in 1986 by inviting them to return to Moscow, according to the Andrei Sakharov Foundation. Bonner, a founding member of the Moscow Helsinki Group in 1976, received the Rafto Prize in 1991 for her promotion of human rights in the former Soviet Union and contemporary Russia, according to the foundation. She moved to the United States to be with her daughter after Sakharov's death in 1989. She published at least four books on her life as a dissident, according to the Harvard website. ""It is with great sadness that I heard"" of Bonner's passing, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said in a statement, describing her as a human rights activist and author. ""She stood side by side with her husband in the fight for political freedom, democracy and human rights in the former Soviet Union, and all over the world. I want to pay tribute to the courage she showed in standing up for fundamental freedoms and human dignity that people worldwide demand.""","European Commission president pays tribute to Bonner's ""courage""

"(CNN) -- Tens of thousands of people have fled their homes as scientists warn the towering Mayon volcano is about to explode in the Philippines, the country's national news agency reported Monday. More than 9,000 families -- a total of 44,394 people -- are being housed in evacuation camps after authorities Sunday raised the alert status of the country's most active volcano, Albay Province Gov. Joey Salceda said. But officials said not everyone is heeding their warnings -- some villagers were spotted within the danger zone checking on their homes and farms on the foothills of the volcano. The government is trying to enforce a ""no man's land"" rule in the designated danger zone, with military and police instructed to double the personnel manning the nine checkpoints and double their foot patrol operation inside the restricted area, PNA reported. Philippine authorities raised the alert status to Level 4 on Sunday which ""means that a hazardous explosive eruption is possible within days,"" according to the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology. ""Audible booming and rumbling sounds were first reported in the eastern flank of the volcano"" Sunday afternoon, and 1,942 volcanic earthquakes were detected by the institute's seismic network in the 24 hours to 7 a.m. local time on Monday (6 p.m. ET on Sunday), the institute said. One was ""an explosion-type earthquake"" that launched a cloud of ash about 500 meters (1,640 feet) into the air, according to the statement. Level 4 means an eruption is considered imminent and Level 5, the highest, means an eruption is taking place. The Institute recommended extending already-established danger zones of 8 km (4.9 miles) south of the summit and 7 km (4.3 miles) north of the summit of the the 8,077-foot volcano. People in surrounding Albay Province have flocked to town centers to catch a glimpse of glowing lava cascading down the slopes of Mayon since the mountain began oozing fiery lava and belching clouds of ash last week. The volcano, located about 500 km (310 miles) south of the Philippine capital of Manila, has erupted 49 times since its first documented eruption in 1616. The Philippines is situated in the so-called Ring of Fire, an arc of fault lines circling the Pacific Basin that is prone to frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Mayon's most violent eruption, in 1814, killed more than 1,200 people and devastated several towns. Its last major eruption was in 1993. Since then, it has remained restless, emitting ash and spewing lava.","Thousands of people evacuated from base of Mayon volcano in Philippines .

"(CNN) -- Thousands of people in southern Chile were told they could return home Sunday, some two weeks after a volcanic eruption forced them to flee. Smoke and ash shot miles into the the sky when a volcano in the Puyehue-Cordon Caulle chain began erupting on June 4. Authorities evacuated more than 4,000 people from the area, according to the state emergency office. ""Fortunately, the volcanic activity has decreased and it is for this reason that we have decided to allow the people who were forced to evacuate to return to their homes,"" Interior Minister Rodrigo Hinzpeter told reporters. Dramatic images of the eruption showed red, orange and gray plumes of smoke rising from the volcano, which is some 540 miles south of Santiago. Ash from the eruption traveled around the world and disrupted flights as far away as Australia and New Zealand. It also forced most airlines flying into Buenos Aires to cancel flights temporarily, and ash fell in the Patagonia region in southern Argentina. Local governments used machinery to clear the roads, which were covered with as much as 30 centimeters (about 1 foot) of ash. Chile is located on the so-called ""Ring of Fire,"" an arc of volcanoes and fault lines circling the Pacific Basin that is prone to frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.","The volcano began erupting in southern Chile about two weeks ago .

"(CNN) -- Deadly violence, ongoing tensions and the deliberate downing of a passenger airplane. Though that turbulence is happening far away from American streets -- in Eastern Ukraine -- why should Americans worry? One reason: renewed fears of a return to Cold War relations between the United States and Russia. Two powerful members of Congress spoke on the matter during separate interviews on CNN's ""State of the Union."" Sen. Dianne Feinstein is the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Does she believe that U.S. and Russian relations are now at Cold War levels? ""Yes,"" the California Democrat said bluntly. Meanwhile, Rep. Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, was asked if U.S. security is under any threat because of the situation in Eastern Ukraine. ""Oh, I mean, sure it is,"" the Texas Republican said. ""And I think this is a game changer, what happened, the downing of this commercial flight by separatists tied to Putin. I think Putin is responsible and complicit for what happened."" He continued: ""Why is that important to Americans? Because I believe ... that we are, Mr. Putin is returning to a Cold War mentality. When I was over there, you could see its nationalistic pride, a sort of resurgence to regain the glory of the old days as the Soviet Empire."" However, McCaul explained a crucial difference. ""It's not the al Qaeda threat,"" he said. ""But it's the threat of brute force. It's the threat that could involve submarine warfare. We know that Russia's more fully engaged in every aspect of that type of warfare. And that concerns me from a homeland security standpoint.""

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- In 1989, the warnings were dire. The Spike Lee film ""Do the Right Thing,"" critics and columnists said, would provoke violence and disrupt race relations. Spike Lee: ""I wanted to do a film that would try to show what was happening at the time."" ""This movie is dynamite under every seat,"" wrote Newsweek's Jack Kroll. Other commentators believed the film would harm the candidacy of David Dinkins, an African-American who was running for mayor of New York. It might even spark riots at movie theaters, they thought. Instead, what the film provoked was ... talk. There were no riots. Dinkins was elected. ""Do the Right Thing"" had a successful run at the box office -- if not as successful as Lee and his supporters hoped -- and was nominated for two Academy Awards. Twenty years later, the film still maintains a hold on the imagination. In 2007, the American Film Institute ranked it as one of the 100 best American films. Roger Ebert, who has written he cried when he first saw the film at the Cannes Film Festival, still considers the film a wonder: ""Spike Lee had done an almost impossible thing. He'd made a movie about race in America that empathized with all the participants,"" he wrote in 2001. So what is the thing about ""Do the Right Thing?""  Watch Spike Lee describe things in his own words » . Part of its staying power is in its boldness, both in look and action. Lee's first two films, ""She's Gotta Have It"" (1986) and ""School Daze"" (1988), had marked him as a rising young filmmaker. But it was ""Do the Right Thing,"" made when Lee was just 32, that showcased his confidence, from the deliberately striking color scheme (bright reds and oranges that make a hot day seem even hotter) to its heightened -- sometimes stagy -- atmosphere, to its grim, documentary-style riot climax. Then there was its willingness to address issues head-on. Lee has said he wrote the film quickly, upset by racial incidents roiling New York City in the 1980s. (In one, the 1986 Howard Beach tragedy, three black men who had wandered into the largely Italian neighborhood by mistake were beaten by a group of white teens; one of the men was killed as he fled across a nearby highway.) ""When I wrote the script ... New York City was a very polarized city, racially,"" he said. ""I wanted to do a film that would try to show what was happening at the time."" He was also determined to roll in other clashes between poor locals and gentrifying whites, between police and citizenry, even between men and women. That friction takes a simple, sketchy plot -- a scorching day in the life of Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood -- and turns it into a series of tense standoffs. The generally African-American residents are trying to beat the heat. Sal, an Italian pizza shop owner, oversees his corner business. A local agitator, Buggin Out, crosses Sal. Sal's prejudiced son Pino faces off with Mookie, the delivery man played by Lee. The residents grumble at the Korean grocer. But all is more or less calm until Sal busts the boombox of the defiant Radio Raheem, and then hell breaks loose. The passion of ""Do the Right Thing"" is obvious: ""Opinion will always be divided on ... 'Do the Right Thing,' "" wrote The New Yorker's Anthony Lane. ""But it remains a thrilling panorama of social crackup -- a wide and worthy development of themes that Lee had been mulling since 'She's Gotta Have It.' "" The film also boasts indelible performances -- Lee, Danny Aiello as Sal, Giancarlo Esposito as Buggin Out, Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee as Da Mayor and Mother Sister, John Turturro as Pino -- and memorable music, a mix of jazz penned by Lee's father, Bill, and the Public Enemy song ""Fight the Power."" But perhaps the real reason people talk about ""Do the Right Thing"" two decades on is because it's still relevant. Lee makes the point that race issues haven't vanished simply because America has a black president.

"New York (CNN) -- A New York college student died of head injuries last week during a fraternity ritual held in Pennsylvania, the local coroner's office said Monday. Baruch College freshman Chun ""Michael"" Deng, 19, died of ""closed head injuries ... due to blunt force head trauma,"" Mary Wallace of the Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, coroner's office said. Also Monday, Pi Delta Psi Fraternity Inc. said it has ""revoked and terminated all affiliation with the Baruch Colony, effective immediately."" ""Baruch Colony has violated the values and rules of our organization,"" the fraternity said. ""We will also revoke the individual membership of any member found involved in this incident."" Charges are expected in Deng's death, which occurred after a fraternity pledge event at a residence in the Pocono Mountains, Monroe County District Attorney E. David Christine said last week. Fraternity kicks out chapter after New York 'hazing' death . The level of charges and who specifically will be charged is not clear, Christine said. More than 30 members of Pi Delta Psi were conducting a ritual outdoors for new pledges called the ""glass ceiling,"" according to a probable cause affidavit obtained by CNN. The objective was for Deng, who was blindfolded and wearing a backpack filled with a 20-pound bag of sand, to navigate toward someone who was calling for him ""while other fraternity brothers physically prevent that from happening,"" witnesses said, according to the affidavit. Deng fell backward, struck his head and was unconscious and unresponsive immediately after he fell, the document states. Other members of the fraternity told authorities they saw Deng get pushed but did not see who did it because it was dark in the yard of the residence where the ritual took place, the affidavit said. Later, three fraternity members drove Deng to a Pennsylvania hospital early on the morning of December 8, authorities said. ""The transport was done in a private vehicle ... which means this poor victim wasn't receiving any medical attention until the time he actually made it to the hospital,"" Christine said. He was unresponsive and in critical condition upon his arrival at the hospital. Physicians determined Deng had suffered major brain trauma, and he was put on life support, according to the district attorney's office. Opinion: Bullying among boys easily dismissed? In a statement, Baruch College said last week that Deng died while participating in an unsanctioned fraternity pledging event. Baruch College has a ""zero tolerance policy regarding hazing,"" according to the statement.

"Katra Sadatganj, Uttar Pradesh, India (CNN) -- It's pitch dark as we drive through the villages of India's most populous state. No street lights line the roads which cross large swaths of farmland; the only flashes of light come from the bolts of lightning which flicker across the stormy night sky. A powerful dust storm has knocked out power supplies as we head into Uttar Pradesh's Budaun district, but the headlights of our car illuminate the hazy figures of men and women squatting behind roadside bushes to defecate. Some 120km ahead of us lies the village -- Katra Sadatganj -- where two schoolgirls were attacked when they went out into the fields to relieve themselves Tuesday night; the pair were gang raped and later found hanged in a mango tree. The brutal assault has brought a range of challenges facing India into the international spotlight, almost 67 years after the country gained its independence from British rule. At Katra Sadatganj, villagers mourning the two girls blame a cocktail of issues for the horrific rape attack, from a lack of decent sanitation, to underdevelopment, to what they call police ""slackness"" in response to the girls' disappearance. According to UNICEF, India has the highest number of people in the world -- an estimated 620 million -- who defecate in the open; only half of the nation's population uses toilets. Most of those living at Katra Sadatganj have little choice in the matter. ""There's no toilet. Where can the girls go?"" shouted Jamuna Devi, one of those who had gathered to mourn the dead girls, as she sat on the mud floor of their home. ""No one has done anything for sanitation,"" she complained. ""We are scared,"" screamed Renu Devi, another of the women consoling the pair's bereaved mothers. ""If this could happen to them, it could happen with us also."" WATCH: India outraged by gang rape and murder . The mourners also accuse police of apathy, echoing concerns raised over and over again by human rights groups and activists concerning the handling of cases by India's law enforcement officers. Most of the country's policing system is based on the 19th-century, colonial-era Indian Penal Code (IPC), designed in the wake of an armed uprising against British rule in 1857. In its 2009 report, U.S.-based Human Rights Watch reported that Indian police forces have yet to evolve from the IPC's original pattern of behavior. Authorities have acknowledged in past years that the country's police have also been under-staffed and under-resourced. Katra Sadatganj's police station has been temporarily shut down after the attack drew national and international attention. Two of its officers are among five people who have been arrested in connection with the schoolgirls' deaths. The arrests so far notwithstanding, the murdered girls' families are unforgiving about the police's response to the case. ""If police wanted, my daughter would have been alive today,"" the father of the eldest victim wailed.","Katra Sadatganj, Uttar Pradesh, is the Indian village where two cousins were raped and hanged .

"(CNN) -- My Facebook feed is suddenly depleted of the usual smiling selfies and is now raging with photos, videos and links to news articles about the war going on between Hamas and the Israeli military. Everyone, it seems, has become their own curator of the news about this conflict. Many of the posts in my feed are about the media bias much of my family and friends perceive in the coverage. A much clearer-cut bias, though, is the one your Facebook feed might have. Some Jews and Muslims on Facebook may have noticed that their own feeds are replete with stories sympathetic to ""one side"" and possibly even hostile to the other side. As a journalist, it feels encouraging to see people so enthralled with the news of our times that they're compelled to share it with everyone they know. But as a 28-year-old who knows plenty of my friends get their news only through their Facebook feed, I'm concerned. I don't fault Facebook for creating an algorithm that feeds us the stories we're most likely to ""Like"" and share, based on what our friends are already liking and sharing. Undoubtedly, the attempt by Facebook engineers to keep us more engaged with our feed never intended to affect the balance of Middle East news coverage. Yet, I do worry that many of my of friends are seeing the news of this entire conflict only through a Facebook filter inadvertently biased against Israel or biased against Gaza, depending on your circle of friends and family. My fear is that they're no longer seeing the variety of reports from seasoned correspondents who go to painstaking lengths to give a complete and encompassing account of the stories in both in Israel and Gaza. Facebook, on the other hand, is programmed to feed up the news from one side: your friends' perspectives. ""It's not just Facebook,"" Eli Pariser, author of the ""The Filter Bubble,"" warned in his TED talk about the dangers of a customized Internet. Pariser points out that a simple Google search of ""Egypt,"" for example, will generate a completely different result and even different news articles customized for each user. ""There's a whole host of companies that are doing this kind of personalization. Yahoo News, the biggest news site on the Internet, is now personalized. Different people get different things,"" Pariser said. ""This moves us very quickly toward a world in which the Internet is showing us what it thinks we want to see, but not necessarily what we need to see."" For every person posting a story sympathetic to ""their"" side, they should take a moment to contemplate that someone else's Facebook feed is likely filled with the stories with the opposite bias. This week, I interviewed the two university students who started the Facebook page and hashtag ""Jews & Arabs Refuse To Be Enemies."" One is an Israeli Jew and the other a Syrian-born American Muslim. They said they were inspired to create the social media campaign, in part, because of the often vitriolic nature of what they've seen posted about Israel or the Palestinians on their own feeds. For many people, the one-sidedness of their Facebook feed might actually be a sign of something they're missing far beyond their feed: a lack of friendships they have across religious and ethnic lines. A few of my friends have even written status updates saying that they've defriended people on Facebook or been defriended for posting opposing views about this war. Muslims defriending Jews and vice versa -- just making the Facebook feed even more biased and insular from an opposing perspective or a shared news story which may be hard for one side to stomach. I admit that there are many important and intriguing stories about the war I've come across through my feed. Social media offer a slice of the story, but they just can't provide a holistic understanding of the news, much less the Middle East. Watching a newscast or reading a newspaper's website seems even more essential now to ensure you're confronting the opinions and reports that challenge your own perceptions and your friends' convictions. I just hope my friends will spend the time reading and watching the nuanced stories from credible journalists as they do from the friends on their Facebook feed. If not, what's arguably the world's most intractable conflict may only be seen by many through the world's largest echo chamber.","Concern that people are seeing news only via social media filter .

"(CNN) -- On Monday Esquire magazine published a massive profile of the Navy SEAL who says he shot Osama bin Laden. Weighing in at some 15,000 words, the story does not identify the killer of al Qaeda's leader by his real name and refers to him only as ""the Shooter."" Clearly the Shooter wanted to maintain something of the code of silence that is pervasive among the covert warriors of SEAL Team 6, the unit that mounted the bin Laden operation. What do we learn from the Shooter's story? Most critically that the Shooter says he killed bin Laden with two shots at close range as he stood in his third floor bedroom in the compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where he had been hiding for more than five years. This account differs in a crucial respect from the book ""No Easy Day"" by Mark Owen, a SEAL who also was on the bin Laden raid. (Mark Owen is a pseudonym; he was quickly revealed to be Matt Bissonnette.) In ""No Easy Day,"" a runaway bestseller that has stayed on the New York Times bestseller list for the past 22 weeks, Bissonnette writes that the SEALs were 15 minutes into the Abbottabad mission when the point man spotted a male poking his head out of a third floor bedroom. He wrote that the point man shot at the mysterious male, and when the SEALs went inside the third floor bedroom they found him lying on the floor in his death throes. Bissonnette and another SEAL quickly finished him off with several more rounds. The dead man was bin Laden. 'Nightmare' at home for SEAL who shot Osama bin Laden . It's a much less heroic story than that of the Shooter, who says he encountered bin Laden face-to-face in the bedroom. The Shooter says he saw that bin Laden's gun was within easy reach, and it was only then that he fired the shots that killed him. The Shooter's version of bin Laden's death matches closely the accounts by reporters who have written most authoritatively about it. It also matches what I saw when I was the only outside observer allowed inside the Abbottabad compound before it was demolished in late February 2012. Accompanied by Pakistani military officers, I examined the bedroom where bin Laden died. The officers showed me a large patch of dark, congealed blood on the low ceiling. It is consistent with the Shooter's account of firing two rounds at the head of a ""surprisingly tall terrorist"" while he was standing up. This evidence tends to undercut Bissonnette's version of bin Laden's death. That said, it is worth noting that the night of bin Laden's death was a very confusing one. As soon as the operation in Abbottabad had started one of the two Black Hawk helicopters crashed. There was a brief but intense firefight with Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, bin Laden's courier. The SEALs also shot and killed the courier's brother, sister-in-law and bin Laden's son Khalid. All this took place in less than 15 minutes on a night when there was no moon and the electricity in the compound and surrounding neighborhood had been turned off. The SEALs were wearing night vision goggles that bathed the compound in a murky, pixilated glow. It was a confusing situation, and that helps explain why Bissonnette's account differs from that of the Shooter. In fact, Bissonnette's account virtually eliminates what the Esquire profile asserts is the Shooter's ""central role in bin Laden's death."" Navy Seals: A battle for the conscience . ""I don't know why he'd do that,"" the Shooter told Esquire. We keep learning more about the hunt for and the death of Osama bin Laden, but it is a complex story, and, in common with many important historical events, the full facts will take many years to emerge. The Shooter's account in Esquire is important to help us understand what happened that night, as is Bissonnette's account. A good deal of the Esquire piece concerns the Shooter's worries about his future now that he has left the military. ""When he leaves after sixteen years in the Navy, his body filled with scar tissue, arthritis, tendonitis, eye damage, and blown disks, here is what he gets from his employer and a grateful nation: Nothing. No pension, no health care, and no protection for himself or his family."" In fact, pretty much any veteran who leaves before 20 years of service is not going to be eligible for a pension. So should the Shooter be treated any differently? Indeed, should other members of key Special Operations units like SEAL Team 6 or the Army's Delta Force who have been at war almost continuously since the 9/11 attacks be given greater benefits given the inordinate amount of combat they have seen? It's an idea that may be worth exploring for those who have seen extensive combat, but the fact is that once you start making such exceptions, the floodgates will open. After more than a decade of war, many veterans in conventional military units would also qualify for such preferential treatment. In a time of budget crisis and large cuts at the Pentagon it is hard to make such a case. After all, what about the thousands of Marines who have also been fighting for many years in tough places like Anbar in western Iraq and Helmand in southern Afghanistan? Should they get a cushy early retirement deal, too? If the Shooter had wanted to get the full benefits that follow 20 years of service he had a choice: Stay in for another four years to qualify for the pension he clearly deserves. It's a choice he didn't make.","Esquire published interview with ex-Navy SEAL who says he shot bin Laden .

"(CNN) -- Red Bull has appealed Daniel Ricciardo's disqualification from last weekend's Australian Grand Prix, the first round of the Formula One season. The Australian driver, making his debut for the all-conquering team, crossed the line in second place before learning of his expulsion. The International Automobile Federation says it will hear the appeal on April 14, the Monday before the fourth race of the season takes place in China. Race stewards found that Ricciardo's car exceeded the sport's ""fuel-flow"" limit during the maiden race of 2014. The limit was introduced in an attempt to make the sport more fuel efficient. Each car is limited to 100kg of fuel per race. Red Bull has cast doubt over the equipment used by F1's governing body the FIA to measure fuel-flow, despite its manufacturers Gil Sensors receiving ""positive feedback"" from the FIA. ""Inconsistencies with the FIA fuel flow meter have been prevalent all weekend up and down the pit lane,"" Red Bull said after Sunday's race. ""The ream and Renault (Red Bull's engine suppliers) are confident the fuel supplied to the engine is in full compliance with the regulations."" A statement on F1's official website read: ""Red Bull's appeal will now be processed by the FIA, who will then set a date for its hearing."" Sunday's race was won by Mercedes' Nico Rosberg, with McLaren rookie Kevin Magnussen taking second place in Ricciardo's absence with his teammate Jenson Button in third.

"(CNN)  -- The private forensic pathologist who conducted an autopsy on Drew Peterson's third wife affirmed the official findings that ruled the death a homicide, a copy of the autopsy report shows. Drew Peterson, a former police sergeant from Bolingbrook, Illinois, is charged with killing his ex-wife. The report, obtained by CNN legal analyst Lisa Bloom, was written by noted pathologist Dr. Michael Baden. He conducted a third autopsy on the body of Kathleen Savio at the request of Savio's family in November 2007. Peterson, a former Bolingbrook, Illinois, police sergeant, pleaded not guilty May 22 to a charge of first-degree murder in Savio's 2004 death. The initial autopsy report concluded that she died as the result of an accidental drowning. Savio was found in the bathtub in her home with a bloody gash on the back of her head; at the time she and Peterson were going through a bitter divorce.  Watch HLN's Jane Velez Mitchell on the case » . But investigators took another look at the case after Peterson was named as a suspect in the October 28, 2007, disappearance of his fourth wife, Stacy Peterson. Savio's body was exhumed on November 13, 2007, and state pathologist Dr. Larry Blum performed a second autopsy. Three days later, Baden conducted another autopsy on behalf of Savio's family. Baden's report cited Blum's findings of a 1-inch blunt-force laceration on the back of her head, five scraping abrasions and six blunt-force black-and-blue bruises on her extremities, abdomen and buttock. Baden also noted that even though the body was partially decomposed, ""bruises and contusions caused by blunt force injuries shortly before death"" were still visible on the right breast, the upper right thigh and the abdomen. The severity of those injuries, Baden said in his report, indicated a struggle.  See a timeline of the case » . ""It is my opinion, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that the drowning of Ms. Savio ... should be properly classified as a homicide,"" the pathologist concluded. The Will County, Illinois, prosecutor announced in February 2008 that the findings of the second autopsy, conducted by Blum, provided the basis to classify the case as a homicide. Peterson has denied any wrongdoing in the disappearance of his fourth wife, Stacy, who was 23 when she was last seen. The former police sergeant remains in jail, awaiting trial on the first-degree murder charge in Savio's death.","Private autopsy found evidence that Kathleen Savio was killed .

"(CNN) -- Both Massachusetts governor candidates have suspended campaign activity Thursday to honor former Boston Mayor Tom Menino, who died this morning, as politicians across the state and D.C. remember the city's longest serving mayor. President Barack Obama said he and First Lady Michelle Obama were saddened to learn of Menino's passing in a statement. ""Bold, big-hearted, and Boston strong, Tom was the embodiment of the city he loved and led for more than two decades,"" the White House statement said. ""His legacy lives on in every neighborhood he helped revitalize, every school he helped turn around, and every community he helped make a safer, better place to live."" Democratic governor candidate and Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley called the fellow Democrat the ""greatest mayor in [Boston's] history."" ""What made Tom Menino so remarkable was his connection to the people he represented -- he understood their lives, their hopes, and their dreams,"" she said in a statement. ""And he fought for them every day."" Coakley's opponent, Republican Charlie Baker, has cancelled public events Thursday and Friday ""out of respect for the passing of Mayor Menino,"" according to a campaign statement on Twitter. Statements of condolences from other well-known politicians continue to pour in, including one from Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts. ""The City of Boston lost a great fighter today. Mayor Tom Menino used his big heart, his strong voice, and his fierce determination to shape every corner of the city."" Warren said. ""Our mayor is gone, but he lives on in every neighborhood in Boston."" Secretary of State John Kerry weighed in with an emotional statement this morning. ""Tom Menino was Boston. In fact, if you just look around the city, you'll see with your own eyes that he is Boston today,"" said Kerry, a former Massachusetts senator, highlighting Menino's folksy appeal and down-to-earth attitude. ""People came up to the Mayor and asked him to fix things, and he followed up and fixed them, whether it was streetlights or parks or getting the snow plowed so people could get to work on time. He knew what built community. He felt the city and the neighborhoods in his bones."" Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick called Menino a ""political giant."" ""[My wife] Diane and I have lost a friend,"" he said. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who led the city for three terms, highlighted his partnership with Menino on gun control. ""Tom Menino was a terrific mayor and a close partner for me,"" Bloomberg wrote in a statement. ""In 2006, we formed Mayors Against Illegal Guns -- and what began as a meeting of 15 mayors ultimately became a coalition of more than 1,000 mayors from around the country. Whether it was tackling illegal guns or reviving neighborhoods, Tom was never afraid to take on tough issues."" Menino, who emerged as a leader on environmental issues, economic development and LGBT rights, announced he would step down in 2013 because of persistent health issues. A few weeks later, he famously left his own hospital bed during the Boston Marathon bombing to appear at a televised memorial service for victims. He died Thursday at 71 after a long battle with cancer.","Both candidates for governor in Massachusetts cancel campaign activity .

"(CNN) -- Mitt Romney has made much of President Barack Obama playing what he considers an inordinate amount of golf. I've even read blogs likening it to Nero fiddling while Rome burned. Perhaps, and then again, perhaps not. Clearly, there has been a long association with the ancient game and the American presidency. In fact, Obama is the 15th of the last 18 presidents to play golf. Not only is he a hugely avid golfer, but a pretty fair one, too. As far as how much time he spends on the links, his annual rate of play is about the same as President Dwight D. Eisenhower, with President Bill Clinton right on their heels. It's clear, the presidency and our great game have quite a thing going. And it seems the golf bug is bipartisan. Many people fondly recall Eisenhower and his utter passion for the game. During his presidency, he played some 210 rounds at Augusta National, the home of the Masters, many with his good friend Arnold Palmer. Such was his fervor for the game, he even had a putting green installed on the White House lawn. But Ike didn't play the most golf among our presidents, nor was he the best. The honor for the most golf played goes to Woodrow Wilson. It's said that he played at least a few holes each day -- even in the snow -- reportedly logging more than 1,000 rounds in his two terms. Maybe that's why the League of Nations failed. The best presidential golfer is widely acknowledged to be John F. Kennedy, usually shooting around 80. But suffering from Addison's disease and a bad back, Kennedy didn't play much while he was in office. He spent more time in his Oval Office rocking chair than on the links. Clinton, a passionate golfer whose foundation is associated with the recent Humana Classic in Palm Springs, California, was best known for taking Mulligans, a somewhat extra-legal do-over shot in a friendly match. The press even coined a term for them -- ""Billigans."" Franklin Delano Roosevelt often played at his family's summer home in Maine before he was stricken with polio. A good golfer who never played while in office, he nevertheless made his mark on the game with his public works projects that led to the development of many public access golf courses, including one of the very best in the country, the Black Course at Bethpage State Park on Long Island, New York, the site of two recent U.S. Opens. Roosevelt left quite a lasting legacy on the game. Lyndon Johnson played the game, warning his playing partners that it wasn't proper to beat the president. Most significantly, he used his outings on the links to secure votes for the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The best athlete as president? Easy: Gerald Ford, a former All-American football center at the University of Michigan. An avid golfer, right after Jimmy Carter was sworn in replacing him, Ford immediately flew to Palm Springs to play golf with Bob Hope in his Pro Am just hours later. There's more: President William Howard Taft, our 27th president, was so obsessive about the game he played in exhibition matches with top-notch players after his term of office; President Calvin Coolidge, who never did get the hang of the game, left his clubs behind when he left the White House; President Richard Nixon, always seemingly politically motivated, was said to have taken up the game to cozy up to Eisenhower and remain on the ticket as his running mate for a second term; and President Ronald Reagan, who was known to putt down the aisle of Air Force One into the section reserved for the national press. There is golf royalty associated with our presidents. George H.W. Bush's grandfather, George Herbert Walker, a former U.S. Golf Association president, donated the Walker Cup, the trophy for the prestigious international biannual amateur team matches. And Bush's father, Prescott, was also smitten with the game, serving as president of the golf association as well and officiating at a number of Bobby Jones' matches. Continuing the family tradition, George W. Bush, our 43rd president, is also an avid player, currently sporting a 12 handicap. But in his presidency, as a sign of respect for the U.S. troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, he said he decided to stop playing golf while they were in harm's way. After all, a president has to know his priorities. While our game is compelling and can be all consuming, it is sometimes incorrectly perceived, more than other presidential leisure activities, as a rich man's game. So maybe, just maybe, the current occupant of the Oval Office should curtail his golf while our troops are still in harm's way and the national unemployment rate is more than 8.5%. As with our other golfing presidents, there's plenty of time for golf later. Besides, he'll never have to wait for a starting time. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter. Join the conversation on Facebook.

"BERLIN, Germany (CNN) -- German federal prosecutors said Friday they have arrested a man suspected of helping a terrorist cell that allegedly plotted attacks against U.S. troops in Germany. The U.S. military's Ramstein Air Base is believed to have been one of the targets for plotters. The prosecutor's office identified the man only as ""Kadir T.,"" and said he is a German of Turkish origin. He is suspected of acquiring a video camera and night-vision equipment for the Islamic Jihad Union group, prosecutors said. The items were allegedly shipped to Waziristan in Pakistan, prosecutors said. Four men trained by the Islamic Jihad Union are on trial in Germany for allegedly plotting attacks against U.S installations in Germany. They are known as the ""Sauerland Group."" Three of the men, two Germans and a Turk, were arrested in September 2007. They were mixing a massive amount of explosive materials that could have resulted in a strong blast, bigger than the attacks in Madrid, Spain, in 2004 and London, England, in 2005, authorities said. Fritz Gelowicz, Martin Schneider, and Adem Yilmaz are charged with membership in foreign and domestic terrorist groups, preparation of explosives, plotting to murder and plotting to commit a crime using explosives, the court said. Schneider is also accused of attempted murder, the court said. The fourth person, identified in German media reports as Attila Selek, is a German citizen of Turkish descent. U.S. interests in Germany were among the targets of the group's plot, Michael Chertoff, who was the U.S. homeland security secretary, said at the time. Gelowicz and Schneider are Germans who converted to Islam. Gelowicz was a leading member of a radical Islamist center in Ulm in southern Germany, and was well known to German authorities, officials said. The Islamic Jihad Union is a little-known Uzbek militant group that claimed responsibility for the plot days after the arrests. It said the intention was to target U.S. and Uzbek targets, a German Interior Ministry spokesman said. German authorities have said the three men trained at the group's camps in northern Pakistan. The group said it wanted to target the Ramstein Air Base and other United States and Uzbek military and diplomatic installations in Germany, the spokesman said. The group also wanted to force Germany to stop using an air base in Uzbekistan as a stopover point for moving equipment and personnel in and out of northern Afghanistan, the spokesman said. The Islamic Jihad Union was unknown until April 2004, when it conducted a series of suicide bombings in Uzbekistan, killing 47 people, according to the Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism. The nonprofit organization is funded by the Department of Homeland Security.

"(CNN) -- Twelve months ago, Nigeria's President Goodluck Jonathan gave his people a bizarre New Year present: he announced the immediate removal of fuel subsidies. The controversial measure meant that, quite suddenly, citizens were to pay as much as three times the usual price for gasoline. Nigerians were outraged. They filled the nation's streets in protest. The coalition was broad: young and old, female and male, poor and (some) rich. Their action, often spontaneous but orchestrated by labor leaders, amounted to a fierce rebuke to Jonathan's administration. The government's unilateral decision was a recipe for new levels of extreme hardship for the poor, taxed already by low wages, ballooning unemployment, a high cost of living, shambling infrastructure -- and the Olympian greed of the elite class. The protesters quickly adopted the banner of ""Occupy Nigeria."" They were animated by a global movement of activists standing up against what they saw as economic exploitation and corruption perpetrated by Western governments, often with the tacit encouragement of powerful corporations. However, ""Occupy Nigeria"" was different from other ""Occupy"" movements. There was a good reason for this. Nigeria's activist voice had gone silent for too long. The country's streets had not felt the pounding of mass protests since the mid-90s, when a coalition of student activists, labor leaders, political activists, lawyers, doctors, academics, artisans and other civil society groups meshed into a powerful pro-democracy movement to drive the military from power. In fact, last January's ""Occupy Nigeria"" protests were largely heralded and led by young people who were born in the early and mid-90s -- a generation that has come to view and use social media as its primary means of activism, social mores and political empowerment. In January 2012, that mass movement put the bloated Nigerian government in the crosshairs. It's believed to be Nigeria's biggest ever national mass protest. Apart from its sheer size, the movement managed to endure for days and weeks. And, in some ways, it set some impressive, unthinkable marks. For instance, some considered it unimaginable that Nigerians (often portrayed as too ""happy,"" too timid and cowardly, too polarized along ethno-religious lines) would unite behind a common cause. Also, it was unthinkable that a mass uprising would start from the nation's capital of Abuja, considered a fortress of the ruling interests. Yet, an intrepid former legislator, Dino Melaye, sparked the protests with a petition drive that ignited a nationwide uprising. See also: Why Nigerians are no longer content with 'suffering and smiling' In a country factionalized along ethnic and religious lines, the movement defied all odds. In Lagos, for example, a radical fiery Christian preacher, Tunde Bakare of the Save Nigeria Group, anchored the protests. In Kaduna, the protests were led by Shehu Sani, a veteran activist and Muslim of the Civil Rights Congress. His religious faith didn't faze young Christian protesters determined to fight for their rights. In some parts of the country, the protests seemed far less organized. It was difficult to determine who was in charge in of them. There was also another novel aspect of the movement. Nigerians across the world also joined the protests to a degree never-before seen. In rally after rally, in the United States, the United Kingdom, Europe and Asia, they made their voices heard. In New York City, Nigerians staged four different actions. The most dramatic was a showdown with a Nigerian minister sent by the Jonathan administration to calm the tempers of Nigerians who felt justifiably insulted by the ill-advised removal of oil subsidies. Her so-called ""Town Hall"" meeting at a five-star hotel in Manhattan was effectively shut down, and the minister disgraced. Nigerians in Australia, Toronto, South Africa, London, Sweden and Accra, Ghana, were soon protesting at the country's embassies demanding change. But the biggest surprise was the protest movement's peaceful nature, especially at a time when the nation was gripped by violent militant groups and armed criminal gangs. Despite provocation by the security agencies and police, the protests were mostly civil and peaceful. The only deaths and injuries recorded in Ilorin, Lagos, Kano, Abuja and Kaduna were reportedly inflicted by the police and soldiers unleashed on hapless citizens. See also: Opinion: Nigeria is a sinking ship - don't desert it . But a year later, it's difficult to argue that the movement achieved its goal. For its size, its failure to compel any serious measures to curb the culture of impunity and corruption in Nigeria is significant. So, what went wrong? Why did the movement crumble in its cradle? These questions perplexed several traditional activist groups and NGOs who were busy attending meetings with the government to seek an amicable resolution to the crisis. One major reason for the quick collapse was the movement's lack of a central command structure. To some extent, it was a leaderless, but not rudderless affair. As the publisher of SaharaReporters, I witnessed the crystallization of a citizen journalist movement. Many citizens wrote and posted reports of the mass protests. They didn't wait around for their stories to be told in distorting sound bites by the foreign media or twisted by a mostly compromised local media. These citizen reporters sent photos, videos and texts. They tweeted, texted and analyzed every minute of the struggle from all over the country and the world, bringing the integrity of their witness to bear. SaharaReporters kept up its side of the bargain; we published the ""field"" reports in a timely manner. See also: Open Story: Unrest in Nigeria . For a moment, many Nigerians hoped that the ""Occupy"" movement would transition into the first sub-Saharan African Spring (or Harmattan). A year later, the conclusion is sobering. It is clear that ""Occupy Nigeria"" failed to metamorphose into a genuine, sustained mass movement. The central labor unions that were initially trusted to lead the movement capitulated quickly under the weight of accusations that they were conniving to overthrow the government. The Nigerian army, notorious for its legacy of intervening to protect the country's corrupt status quo, was deployed to quell the protests. On the bright side, the Nigerian people, especially the younger generation, got a taste of people power. I have no doubt that they can -- and will -- exercise that power again. Few as they were, some immediate gains testified to the power of the mass uprising. After two national addresses, a brow-beaten President Goodluck Jonathan rolled back fuel prices and reinstated some fuel subsidy. And he made a commitment -- far from realized -- to identify and punish profiteers from fuel subsidy scams. For Nigerians, one lesson is that they possess a latent power capable of bringing change -- if only the people will it. There are also important lessons about opportunists and saboteurs. It wasn't hard to see their trails during and after the mass protests. The protests had hardly died down when some of the labor leaders found their way into plush government committees. Others formed themselves into ""stakeholders"" and began earnestly to jostle for government patronage even as the issues that sparked the protests had not been addressed. Even so, I believe the awareness created about the pervasive corruption in the oil sector made a difference. But it was not the issue. After all, Nigerians already knew government officials and their corporate accomplices were stealing. ""Occupy Nigeria"" simply washed the carcass of the whale of corruption ashore. The eventual revelation by a parliamentary committee that a grand sum of $6.8 billion had been stolen through subsidy scams is a yet unresolved scandal. Nigerians suspect, with good reason, that their top government officials are in no hurry to unmask the gluttonous embezzlers of fuel subsidies. In fact, the impression is that the culprits, law enforcement officials, and the judges have all retired to their usual zone of criminal complicity and comfort. No one will be punished. As the people of Nigeria still hanker for their African ""Spring,"" the ""Occupy"" movement can re-emerge at any time to take Nigeria by storm. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Omoyele Sowore.","In January 2012, Nigerians protested the removal of fuel subsidies .

"(CNN) -- Police have smashed an illegal betting syndicate in Macau for allegedly taking the equivalent of US$645 million in bets on World Cup matches. It's believed to be the biggest ever raid on an illicit football bookmaking racket in the Asian casino capital, according to police. The gambling ring used three hotel rooms to take internet and phone bets from around the world, a first coordinator for the Macau Judiciary Police told CNN. One gambler placed a bet valued at around US$5 million, initial investigations found. Police arrested some 22 people from mainland China, Hong Kong and Malaysia in the raid on Thursday. Two of the suspects, from China and Malaysia, were believed to be the ringleaders of the syndicate. Officers seized cash worth around US$248,000, along with 17 computers, at least 10 cell phones, and betting slips. A second gambling syndicate was busted in the same hotel hours later, with police arresting four Chinese men early Friday morning. According to police, the second betting ring took around US$645,000 in illegal bets on World Cup matches in a single day. Police have not released the name of the hotel. The arrests are part of a cross-border campaign to crack down on illegal betting in Macau, Hong Kong and China's southern Guangdong province around the World Cup. Authorities from the Pearl River Delta region are also cooperating with Interpol and seven other Asian nations to tackle illicit gambling. More than half of the world's illegal sports bets are placed in Asia, according to a recent study by the International Center for Sport Security and Paris Sorbonne University. Since the tournament began, Hong Kong police have arrested a total of 39 suspects over illegal gambling and seized betting slips worth around US$10 million, according to the South China Morning Post. The city's legal gambling authority, the Hong Kong Jockey Club, is the second biggest betting operator worldwide. The club said illicit sports betting in Hong Kong generated an estimated HK$500 billion (US$64.5 billion) last year -- almost four times the amount the Jockey Club turned over in the same period. In Singapore, 15 people have been arrested for allegedly receiving illegal football bets equivalent to US$640,000 in the past two weeks, police said Monday. Police in Malaysia have also arrested dozens of suspected illegal bookmakers since the World Cup began.

"Donetsk, Ukraine (CNN) -- Ukraine's President-elect Petro Poroshenko has vowed to punish the ""bandits"" who shot down a military helicopter as the government's efforts to rein in pro-Russia separatists continue. ""The deaths of the military troops in Slovyansk are pain our whole nation is feeling,"" Poroshenko posted on his Facebook page late Thursday. ""While mourning with rest of the Ukraine, I give my condolences to the families and loved ones of the fallen heroes. Crimes of the bandits will not be left unpunished."" Militants in the rebel stronghold of Slovyansk, in the Donetsk region, claimed responsibility for downing the helicopter, a spokesman for the separatists said. A dozen servicemen died, authorities said, including a general. The separatist unrest that has gripped Ukraine in recent weeks has been centered in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. Acting Ukrainian Defense Minister Mikhail Koval said Friday that the military would continue its ""anti-terrorism"" operation until the east has been fully stabilized, Russia's state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported. ""We will work until this region starts living and functioning normally, and the people there feel safe,"" Koval is quoted as saying. International monitors sent by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, at the invitation of Ukraine, have been surveying the situation on the ground -- but they appear increasingly at risk of being targeted by armed groups. Four are said to be in the hands of pro-Russian separatists in Slovyansk, having gone missing Monday. And Friday, the OSCE said it had also lost contact with some members of its Luhansk-based team as of the previous evening after armed men stopped them. The team, which was in Severodonetsk, about 60 miles north of the city of Luhansk, consists of four international monitors and a Ukrainian translator, traveling in two vehicles, the OSCE statement said. Another 11 monitors were detained for several hours Wednesday after armed men stopped them in Marinka, west of the city of Donetsk, but were later released, according to the OSCE. Several weeks ago, another OSCE team was taken captive by militant separatists in Slovyansk. Its members were freed a little more than a week later. Grenade blast . Many are now looking at Poroshenko, whose inauguration is expected next week, to restore peace and stability to the divided nation. Amid simmering tensions, heavily armed militants clashed with a National Guard unit Thursday in the town of Oleksandrivsk in the Luhansk region, the National Guard said on its website. A grenade hit the unit's weapons depot, which exploded, destroying weapons and ammunition, the guard said. No casualties were reported. On Monday, a Ukrainian military operation against pro-Russia militants who had seized a part of Donetsk International Airport resulted in as many as 70 deaths, according to the separatists, although local officials' estimates were lower. At least 33 Russian citizens are among the militants killed, a spokesman for the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic told CNN. Their bodies are to be returned to Russia. Kiev and the West have accused Russia of coordinating and supplying the separatists, an allegation Moscow has denied. Russian troops 'pulling back' On Thursday, a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the latest intelligence said 30,000 Russian troops that had been amassed along the Russia-Ukraine border have been moving back to their home bases over the past several days. About 10,000 troops -- mainly infantry -- remain along Russia's border with eastern Ukraine, the official said, and there are signs those troops will be pulling back as well. NATO this week also reported that some Russian troops near Ukraine's eastern border may be preparing to pull back. The United States has been using satellites to track Russian troop movements for weeks, and both the United States and NATO have released imagery to bolster their case that Russia had amassed tens of thousands of troops along the border. U.S. officials have said it appears the Russians have decided to try to work with the new Ukrainian government, but officials also point out that it wouldn't take much to bring a large number of Russian forces back to the border via transport aircraft at any time. Diplomatic steps . Poroshenko has been invited by French President Francois Hollande to attend the 70th D-Day commemoration ceremonies on June 6, the Elysee Palace said. Russian President Vladimir Putin is also invited to take part in the D-Day ceremonies, raising the prospect that the leaders could hold discussions then. Even if international diplomatic efforts bear fruit, talks on the ground in Ukraine are complicated by divisions within the separatist movement. Serhiy Taruta, the billionaire governor of Donetsk, told CNN Thursday he was in talks with pro-Russia separatist leaders in the region to try to calm the situation. But he suggested it was not proving easy. ""We are having dialogue, which is dragging out because they seem to have a constant rotation of their leaders, but I hope that in the final analysis we will reach an agreement and reconciliation to work together,"" he said. Taruta has met with Poroshenko in Kiev, he said, adding that the President-elect will visit the Donetsk region ""we hope in the first half of June."" The governor, speaking in Kiev, acknowledged that a Ukrainian military operation was under way in the Donetsk region, but he was unable to comment further. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh reported from Donetsk, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported in London. CNN's Barbara Starr, Hala Gorani and Boriana Milanova contributed to this report, as did journalist Francesca Humi.","Four more international monitors have gone missing, this time in Luhansk .

"(CNN) -- When President Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, he reportedly said Democrats would lose the South for a generation. At the time, 115 of the 128 senators and representatives from the 11 former Confederate states were white Democrats. Today, all Democratic congressmen from Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, South Carolina and Georgia are black, except for John Barrow of Georgia; and all Republican congressmen from these states are white, except for Tim Scott of South Carolina. Part of that has to do with policy. And a lot of that has to do with the white backlash Johnson correctly predicted. So if Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, and his cohorts are really serious about bringing minorities into their big tent, they need to do more than massage the party's message. They need to do more than rethink its policies. They have to be honest about who is in their tent already. I applaud the effort of the RNC's 98-page Growth and Opportunity Project report. But it's hard to characterize it as an honest assessment of the party when it doesn't include the words ""racism,"" ""racists"" or ""racist"" in it. How can this so-called ""autopsy"" be accurate when it doesn't include the cause of death? I'm not saying the Republican Party is full of bigots. I'm saying history teaches us that the Republican Party is where white racists in the South turned for shelter in response to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the remnants of that migration is still impacting its image today. To characterize the Republican Party's difficulties to grasp the country's new demographics as ""they're too old and white"" oversimplifies a conversation that is much more nuanced than that. The reason why some minorities -- particularly blacks -- have a distaste for the Republican Party is because any policy that negatively impacts minorities disproportionately is being viewed through the electoral dynamic that was created in 1964. Opinion: Want black votes, GOP? Listen to black voters . If Priebus and company can't see and admit that, their new plan is not going to solve much of anything. I agree with Eric Cantor, Chris Christie and Jon Huntsman on a lot of issues. As an independent, it really pains me to know much of their messages get tainted nationally because their party has this lingering image problem. As the glaring omissions in the Growth and Opportunity Project report suggests, this wound is self-inflicted. For as long as GOP leaders refuse to acknowledge and confront racism in their party, they will continue to have a hard time convincing minorities they have their best interests in mind. Now, I'm sure spending $10 million to pay people to hang out with minorities and talk about how great the Republican Party is seems like a good idea. But when there is footage of a black man being beaten and run over by a group of white teenagers who reportedly wanted to ""go fuck with some niggers"" nearly 50 years after Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act, trust me, minorities are not looking for rent-a-friend to come talk to us about the Grand Old Party. We're looking for advocates who will listen. Who can see the South is not the South of bus boycotts and burning crosses -- but it is still the South. Who will see that Barry Goldwater, who opposed the Civil Rights Act, won 87.1% of Mississippi's votes in the 1964 general election and that lawmakers in Mississippi just got around to ratifying the 13th Amendment in 2013. Ruby Burdette, whose son was found dead along a rural Mississippi road in 2009, didn't receive her first visit from the Sheriff's Office until CNN reporters called asking about the progress of the investigation this year. ""He came in and said he was the investigator,"" Burdette said. ""He told me he apologized for no one coming out before now. And he told me that the first investigators they had didn't do anything."" More than three years had gone by, and the authorities didn't bother to look for who had killed her son. If Republican leaders really want to appeal to minorities --put that in the report. And do it not as a way to pander for votes, but to acknowledge the problem. There is definitely a fair share of bigots in the Democrat Party, and liberals can be quick to attribute problems impacting minorities to racism. But far too often, the GOP is quick to dismiss racism as a factor in anything, which draws attention to the party's lack of self-awareness. The Republican Party as a whole is saddled with the perception of having a diversity problem, and its recent political history justifies that perception. From what I know of Priebus, he is smart enough to know all of this. The fact this issue is not addressed in the report suggests he still isn't sure what to do about it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","The Republican National Committee released a report on how to connect with minorities .

"(CNN) -- In a move aimed at boosting mental health treatment, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius on Friday announced new rules that will put teeth in a 2008 mental health equity law. The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, signed by President George W. Bush, requires doctors and insurers to treat mental illness the same as physical illness. Sebelius made the announcement to applause at the Rosalynn Carter Symposium on Mental Health Policy in Atlanta. The move ""finally puts mental health and behavioral health on equal footing,"" Sebelius said. On paper, the law made mental health more accessible, but there has been virtually no enforcement of it, said Dr. Jeffrey Lieberman, president of the American Psychiatric Association and a Columbia University psychiatrist. ""Up to now, the law has not been complied with,"" Lieberman said. ""Companies have only sort of adhered to it."" Insurance companies often cover mental illness in a more limited fashion than physical illness. Now the rule will require insurers to charge similar co-payments regardless if the treatment is for physical or mental health. Deductibles and doctor visits would also be equitable, and there would be parity in outpatient services and residential treatment. ""Many private insurers gave nothing. Some provided benefits, but they were limited and inadequate,"" Lieberman said. The law, the new rules and provisions of Obamacare combined will ensure mental and physical illness would be covered similarly. America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), the professional association that represents the health insurance industry, said it has long supported the act and has worked to implement its requirements in an affordable and effective way. ""We appreciate that the final rule enables patients with mental and behavioral health conditions to continue to benefit from the innovative programs and services health plans have pioneered,"" AHIP's President and CEO Karen Ignagni said in a statement. Opinion: Wipe out the stigma of mental illness . For example, insurance companies can no longer authorize a 30-day hospital stay for a stroke and only a two-day stay in the hospital for someone who has had a psychotic break. In addition, people with pre-existing mental conditions like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or depression will no longer be denied insurance coverage -- and under Obamacare, a mental illness diagnosis will no longer trigger a potential loss of coverage. About one in four adults suffer from a diagnosable mental disorder in a given year, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. Sebelius pointed out that twice as many people die from suicides as homicides. The ""incredibly important law, combined with the Affordable Care Act, will expand and protect behavioral health benefits for more than 62 million Americans,"" Sebelius said. ""People who either have insurance coverage now and have no mental health coverage or where the Affordable Care Act fills in those gaps for people who have no insurance at all, they will be able to access affordable care with mental health and substance abuse benefits."" She called it ""the largest expansion of behavioral health benefits in a generation."" That is, if there are enough providers to deal with the potential influx of new patients. ""The not-so-good news is you are eligible for treatment now, but often the services are not available,"" said Carolyn Reinach Wolf, an attorney who specializes in cases involving mental illness. Surveys show there are only about 50,000 psychiatrists in the United States. According to the APA, that number is already too few to care for the existing number of people seeking treatment. And trends for the profession don't sound promising, according to the association. Enrollment in psychiatry programs is down, and over half of the profession is 55 or older which means they are nearing retirement age. Often, Wolf said, psychiatrists and psychologists don't take insurance, and patients struggling with mental illness or the families who care for them are too overwhelmed to have to process the paperwork themselves. ""Mental illness is not curable. It is a chronic lifetime illness and it requires a tremendous amount of resources to get them into treatment and to monitor that treatment. It is a huge cost to manage that care,"" Wolf said. Insurers still have to make money, which is difficult with this kind of ongoing, expensive treatment, she said. Now that the final rules have been announced, Lieberman argues there needs to be ""more transparency and means of enforcement. Or how do you know private insurers will comply?"" Friday's announcement applies to private insurance. The rules do not apply to people on Medicaid because the Obama administration has already given states guidance on how those plans should be meeting requirements set out by the 2008 law. Reframing the gun control debate: Is mental health the next focus? The Georgia setting for Sebelius' announcement seems particularly appropriate as an acknowledgement of former first lady Rosalynn Carter's long efforts to destigmatize mental illness. Carter is the author of a handful of books on the topic, and the Mental Health Systems Act was passed in 1980 in large part due to her advocacy. The law provided more funding for community-based care and created a system of prevention services and an advocate system for those who struggle with mental illness. That law also had a parity provision that was never enforced, Sebelius said Carter had told her. ""Finally, in 2013, we are achieving this,"" she said. CNN's Caleb Hellerman and Trisha Henry contributed to this report.","Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act was signed into law in 2008 but not enforced .

"(CNN) -- Whether viewed as a show of force to Russia or a sign of reassurance to nervous allies, the recent deployment of U.S. Army forces to Poland and three Baltic states is steeped in matters strategic and diplomatic to American foreign policy. A contingent of 150 paratroopers arrived in Poland on Wednesday from their base in Italy to conduct joint training exercises with the Polish military as the situation in neighboring Ukraine shows no sign of easing. An additional deployment of 150 paratroopers to Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, respectively, will take place over the coming months. With the announcement, the Obama administration is effectively sending a message that with all the talk of a ""re-balance"" in focus to the Asia-Pacific region, the exercises also show that the U.S. commitment to the NATO alliance is solid. ""It's a very tangible representation of our commitment to our security obligations in Europe, and the message is to the people of those countries and to the alliance that we do take it seriously,"" Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said this week. With Russia massing an estimated 40,000 to 50,000 troops under the guise of military exercises along its border with Ukraine, anxiety is running high among some of the newer members of NATO, themselves former states within the Soviet Union, regarding Russia's possible designs on territorial expansion. Under the collective defense clause of the NATO charter, an attack on one member constitutes an attack on the entire alliance, thus obligating American involvement in any response to such an attack. The exercises are a manifestation of that obligation. ""It sends a signal to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin his ambitions can't go as far as the NATO territory because we have this commitment to them,"" Nicholas Burns, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO, said in an interview with CNN on Wednesday. Ukraine is not a member of NATO. While the United States conducts exercises with the four countries on a routine basis, the Pentagon acknowledges the newest exercises are in part a response to the ongoing instability in Ukraine. ""These exercises were conceived and added on to the -- added on to the exercise regimen as a result of what's going on in Ukraine,"" Kirby said. But are the exercises sending the right message to both Putin and U.S. allies in NATO? Senior Republican members of Congress say they are a good first step, but require the necessary follow through by the administration. ""We should have them in Poland, Latvia, Estonia and make it clear this is not just a temporary measure,"" Rep. Peter King, a Republican of New York, told CNN in an interview. ""One criticism I would have of the President is he's not up until now shown we're in this for the long haul."" ""Do I think we could do larger NATO exercises, U.S.-led in a place like Poland? I do,"" said Rep. Mike Rogers, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""This is a very good start and a very good sign to let Putin know that we won't tolerate, the United States won't tolerate any incursion into NATO states."" While the Pentagon will not say how long the new exercises will last, NATO is still exploring additional responses and measures the alliance can take with regard to Ukraine. One former senior U.S. military officer told CNN that such exercises are important to maintaining the NATO alliance, but they will require more lift from European partners in the future. ""For the NATO countries, if they want to be reassured, they need to help with this by putting some real money towards their defense budgets,"" Gen. Richard Myers (Ret.), the former Joint Chiefs Chairman, told CNN. ""They've been underfunding defense for many, many years for lots of reasons. And if they're really serious about this, they've got to help. It can't just be the U.S. alone.""","U.S. deploying paratroopers to Poland and other NATO states in show of support for Atlantic alliance .

"Washington (CNN) -- There is no constitutional requirement that the Supreme Court preside over the inaugural - it's just been that way and a little history was made around that on Sunday. Chief Justice John Roberts delivered the oath at the White House to President Barack Obama for a second term. Just prior, Justice Sonia Sotomayor swore in Joe Biden to another four years as vice president, becoming the first Latina jurist to administer an inaugural oath. Biden was instrumental in Sotomayor's vetting and ultimate selection by Obama for the high court and said it was an ""incredible honor"" for him to have her deliver the oath. The justice told CNN's Soledad O'Brien on Friday that she was not feeling anxious about the inaugural duties, but rather viewing the responsibilities as ""surreal."" ""I was thinking just a couple of days ago, if I think back when I was a kid which of the two would seem more improbable to me I realized each one was so far fetched that I couldn't have imagine either,"" she saidâ€”sitting on the Supreme Court ""and swearing in the vice president in front of the nation and the world."" 13 reasons to follow the inauguration on CNN's platforms and nowhere else . Sunday's vice presidential inauguration at the Naval Observatory, where Biden lives, was moved up to accommodate Sotomayor's scheduling conflict. ""I want to explain to you what a wonderful honor it was and how much out of her way the justice had to go,"" Biden said. ""She is due in New York. She has to leave right now, so I apologize."" Sotomayor then headed out to catch a train to the Big Apple for a book signing for her new autobiography, ""My Beloved World."" The swearing in went off without a hitch, which Sotomayor said was a result of careful planning on her part. ""When you read my book, you realize I practice everything I do over and over again,"" she told CNN. Like Roberts, Sotomayor had the oath written on a small card. After delivering it, she offered a simple ""congratulations."" She will be back in Washington for Monday's public swearing in at the Capitol where she will administer the oath to Biden again. Roberts will do the same for Obama. Obama sworn in during private ceremony . The Constitution requires executive officers, including the president, as well as members of Congress and federal judges, to ""be bound by oath or affirmation."" But nothing mandates a Supreme Court justice administer it. When it comes to the presidential inauguration, they just have done so most of the time. There was no Supreme Court formed when George Washington took the first oath of office in 1789, so New York's highest ranking judge did the honors at Federal Hall on Wall Street. Four years later, Associate Justice William Cushing swore in Washington for a second term, beginning the Supreme Court tradition. Early inaugurals were usually conducted in the House or Senate chamber. The 1817 inaugural was held outdoors for the first time when James Monroe took the oath in front of the Old Brick Capitol, where Congress met temporarily after the original Capitol was burned by British troops in the War of 1812. The Monroe swearing-in site is now the Supreme Court building. The man who handled the duties 196 years ago was John Marshall, widely acknowledged as the most influential chief justice in U.S. history. He participated in a record nine swear-ins, from Thomas Jefferson to Andrew Jackson.","First Latina justice, Sonia Sotomayor, swears in Vice President Joe Biden .

"Washington (CNN) -- Environmental advocacy groups hope President Barack Obama will live up to the words of his second inaugural address that put climate change front and center on the national agenda even though he rarely mentioned it during the presidential campaign. But the same advocates, including the Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council, say the president should use the power of the executive branch to further those aims rather than pursuing a congressional strategy. Melinda Pierce, legislative director for the Sierra Club, pushed the president to focus more on executive orders and regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency than on legislation. ""Congress is a place where good ideas go to die,"" she said. ""There is a tremendous amount that his administration can do without Congress. He has the authority; he doesn't have to wait for Congress."" Eric Pooley, senior vice president of the Environmental Defense Fund, told CNN that while ""serious climate legislation isn't in the cards this year"" the White House understands that congressional ""legislation is not the only way to make progress."" CNN Poll: Do Americans agree with Obama on climate change and immigration? ""There is a clear plan of action here,"" Pooley said. ""It is time to just get started with the rule-making, which is a process that gives ample time for give and take between the administration and industry."" Included in the list of executive actions that Pierce and others hope for are curbing carbon emissions among existing power plants, not just new plants, and mandating high efficiency standards to larger trucks and longer haul vehicles. Those sort of executive branch actions are similar to what Obama pushed for during his first term. In 2011, the EPA issued new standards on toxic pollutants and mercury emissions from coal power plants. Obama also finalized regulations requiring that passenger cars and trucks nearly double their fuel efficiency by 2025. Bob Keefe, spokesman for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said Obama's first term was successful on environmental issues because of those actions. However, he acknowledged that he would have liked to have seen more from the president. ""You take what you can get and you hope for more,"" Keefe said. ""I think the president is recognizing this in his speech."" Why 2013 could be a game-changer on climate . In a lengthy paragraph in his address on Monday, Obama said, ""We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that failure to do so would betray our children and future generations. The path towards sustainable energy sources will be long and sometimes difficult. But America cannot resist this transition; we must lead it. We cannot cede to other nations the technology that will power new jobs and new industries -- we must claim its promise."" The president made little mention of climate policy in his 2012 campaign and outlined little, if any, specific climate policy plans for his second term. Obama's climate policies, specifically Energy Department loan and grant programs for developing advanced energy technologies, were used against him on the campaign trail following the bankruptcy of Solyndra, which received economic stimulus money. Attack ads featured a visit Obama made to the California solar panel manufacturer and Republican candidate Mitt Romney used the bankruptcy to highlight what Republicans believed were misspent taxpayer funds on unproven energy projects. Pooley called this time period -- the last two years of Obama's first term -- the ""two years of silence,"" when very little talk was devoted to climate change. It wasn't until Superstorm Sandy, an extraordinary confluence of powerful weather systems, devastated coastal New York and New Jersey in late October that the issue of climate change made an impact on the political season. Obama's speech ties current issues to founding principles . Before the storm hit, the last time both candidates mentioned the issue in any substantive manner was in written statements to a science organization in September. ""Sandy put this thing back on the agenda with an vengeance and restarted a national climate conversation,"" Pooley said. ""That is the reality, that is what reminded everybody that this issue is not going away, that we need to deal with it."" Next step: Obama's State of the Union speech on February 12. Pooley said he has ""every reason to suspect"" that Obama is going to unveil more detail in that speech about ""what he is going to do.""","Activists push for Obama to focus more on executive orders and EPA regulations than on legislation.

"Fukushima, Japan (CNN) -- It was 11 March 2011, and I remember standing in the newsroom that Friday afternoon glued to the television watching the horrific images coming out of Japan. The aerial pictures of the tsunami as it engulfed the coastline swallowing up everything in its path filled me with dread. That image will be etched in my memory forever. Little did I know that 24 hours later I would be on the ground in Japan covering the nation's biggest disaster. While we were focused on the mass devastation and the countless victims from the earthquake and tsunami, there was another catastrophe unfolding -- a nuclear crisis. The disaster had caused meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant and it was threatening Armageddon. No reporter was allowed anywhere near Fukushima -- it was too unsafe. It would be more than two and a half years before I'd finally set foot in Fukushima. We've been invited by the plant operator TEPCO to inspect the progress being made -- it's the first time any media crew has been allowed that close to the decommissioning work underway inside Fukushima. As we drive towards the plant I notice empty houses, overgrown gardens and fields and realize these homes haven't been touched since their residents evacuated during the crisis in 2011. This once bustling community of 60,000 people is now a ghost town; the only sign of life, a checkpoint in the middle of the road. Hazardous fuel removal process begins at Fukushima . We've entered the ""exclusion zone."" The only people passing through are the 3,500 workers who travel each day to Fukushima to undertake dangerous clean-up work, exposing themselves to high levels of radiation. We arrive at the plant under a TEPCO escort and are taken to a building to measure our radiation levels. We'll do this again at the end of the tour to see how much radiation we've each absorbed. Then it's time get kitted up in protective clothing. The ensemble includes a Tyvek suit, two pairs of socks, rubber boots, three pairs of gloves, a hat and mask -- no skin is left exposed. We also carry a dosimeter to measure the external radiation levels. With the appropriate attire and equipment, we are taken on a tour of the plant situated at the base of mountains, right on the coast. As we look out at the calm sea, it's hard to imagine how the ocean could have been so deadly and destructive that day back in 2011. The single success story for TEPCO is Reactor 4 -- it suffered a hydrogen explosion during the crisis, but received the least amount of damage of all four reactors. The reason? It was under maintenance and wasn't operational the day the earthquake and tsunami hit. Inside the giant building that has been rebuilt is a large cooling pool. Above the pool is an enormous crane that has begun to successfully move the 1500 fuel rods covered in the deep green water. TEPCO has described this as ""a milestone."" They're being transported to a storage pool next door where they will stay for the next 20 years. It's a delicate and slow process that's expected to be completed by the end of 2014 -- decommissioning reactor 4. But these milestones are few and far between. TEPCO's main challenge is working out how to shut down Reactors 1, 2 and 3 that all suffered meltdowns and remain dangerously radioactive. The other big problem is contaminated water. TEPCO is collecting 400 tonnes of it each day, storing it in newly built tanks on the site. There is a real fear this radioactive water is seeping into the ground and into the sea. As I look around the plant from a high vantage point on top of one of the buildings I see a broken Fukushima desperately trying to heal itself and a country that came so close to a nuclear catastrophe. Japan is indebted to the thousands of workers, who risk their life each day, continuing their mission to finish the job and close this painful and frightening chapter in Japan's history.","CNN was granted exclusive access to the heart of Fukushima's nuclear plant .

"(CNN) -- Neil Bolen has worked as a civil engineer with the Federal Aviation Administration for the past 24 years, designing air traffic control radar systems that help keep America moving. Now he's got a message for Congress: Get moving on a plan to save his job. Bolen, a 48-year-old father of two from the Atlanta area, is one of thousands of Americans with ties to the aviation industry who are suddenly finding themselves out of work this summer because of Congress's failure to pass routine legislation keeping the FAA funded. The House and Senate have gone on vacation, leaving Bolen on furlough. He's had no choice but to file for unemployment, prioritize which bills to pay, and dig into his family's savings in order to make ends meet. ""Congress doesn't care about me at all,"" Bolen told CNN. ""They're not done with their work and they go on vacation. How do they do that?"" Bolen says he's tried to ""avoid politics as a rule"" his whole life, but now he's calling his congressman and senators -- to no avail. ""It's always somebody else's fault"" when you call their offices, he says. ""It's never our fault."" The House adjourned Monday after a divisive vote to raise the national debt ceiling, leaving the Senate with an FAA funding extension bill it did not like and could not amend. So the Senate recessed Tuesday night without doing anything. At issue is a decision by Rep. John Mica, a Florida Republican, to add a provision to the funding extension cutting subsidies to rural airports. The measure is opposed by powerful Democrats such as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada. There's also a dispute over provisions that would make it easier for airline employees to unionize. Democrats support the section; Republicans generally oppose it. Bolen and 4,000 other FAA employees are stuck in the middle of the dispute. But they're not the only people being hurt. The FAA has stopped hundreds of airport construction projects nationwide, putting about 24,000 construction workers out of work. Another 35,000 support workers, such as food service vendors, are also affected, according to the Associated General Contractors of America. The FAA says the impasse will also prevent the federal government from collecting approximately $200 million a week in airline passenger taxes -- or about $1.2 billion during the congressional recess. Other workers caught up in the mess share Bolen's frustrating and growing anger with Congress. ""We're into the politics of confrontation versus looking out for the interests for constituents,"" said Troy Swanberg, a mechanical engineer from Chicago. ""I'm really disappointed."" He called the situation ""unconscionable."" Swanberg, 42, has worked for the FAA for 20 years and has a 2-year-old daughter. Like Bolen, he's digging into his savings. He's also looking for another job. Robert Aitken, 47, works for the FAA in Burlington, Massachusetts. He's been with the FAA for 18 years, and before that spent five years in the Navy. He has two children, ages 9 and 12. ""We're just in shock that (Congress) actually did not get this done,"" he told CNN. ""We understand this is politics, but this is just insane."" Aitken said he's ""very upset"" Congress ""didn't think this was important enough to stick around for."" He stressed that it's not just federal workers who are being hurt by the latest Washington stalemate. ""They're going to put people out of business,"" he warned. ""Small companies will go under."" Curtis Howe, 50, works for the FAA in Seattle. He helped build the control tower at nearby Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, among other things. Recently, he and his wife took out a 15-year home equity loan in order to put a new roof on their house. Now he's being forced to use that money to pay his regular bills. ""It's almost like there's a ... dog walking down the road, and he picked up a hand grenade in his mouth and it's going to go off. They don't even know what they're doing,"" he said in reference to Congress. ""Who are they? Are they better than us?"" ""This is a clear attack on middle America,"" Howe said. ""This is a punch in the face. It's terrible."" CNN's Jennifer Liberto contributed to this report .","4,000 aviation workers are being furloughed because Congress hasn't approved FAA funding .

"(CNN) -- After an agonizing week of waiting, hoping and praying, Brett Anderson reunited with his 16-year-old daughter, Hannah, on Sunday, according to a source close to the situation. Hannah was rescued in the Idaho wilderness after an FBI agent shot and killed the family friend suspected of killing her mother and brother, burning his own house down and kidnapping the girl. James DiMaggio's death and Hannah's rescue late Saturday afternoon ended a frantic, weeklong manhunt. The girl did not appear to have significant physical injuries, authorities said. ""It's now healing time,"" the girl's father said in a text message to CNN. ""They didn't fit"" Hannah went missing after cheerleading practice in San Diego County, California, on August 3. The next day, the bodies of her mother, Christina Anderson, and 8-year-old brother, Ethan, were found about 45 miles east in DiMaggio's burned house in Boulevard. That horror spurred a manhunt, which zeroed in on central Idaho after two critical clues: the discovery of DiMaggio's blue Nissan Versa outside the city of Cascade and a sighting of the pair by horseback riders. One of the horseback riders on Sunday described multiple ""red flags"" that were raised during their brief interaction with the pair, including their brand-new camping equipment and the pajama-like bottoms Hannah was wearing. Mark John recalled the interaction as ""just like a square peg going into a round hole. They didn't fit."" Another rider, Mike Young, said it looked like Hannah ""had a scared look on her face,"" adding about DiMaggio: ""I just had a gut feeling about him."" Unaware of the Amber Alert, however, the horseback riders continued on, and only after seeing a news report on the pair upon returning home did the group put the puzzle pieces together. ""When I seen that picture on the screen, I told my wife, I said, 'That is the girl that was up on that mountain,'"" John recalled. Hundreds of law enforcement agents scoured 300 square miles of rough terrain, hampered by the smoke from nearby wildfires. Key moments in the manhunt . Late Saturday afternoon, they spotted the pair's campsite near Morehead Lake, Idaho. But the topography was so steep, helicopters had to drop authorities off far away from the camp. Hostage rescue teams had to hike more than two hours to get to the scene, local sheriffs' departments said. They moved in carefully so they wouldn't alert DiMaggio that they were coming. ""Once the teams set up, they waited until DiMaggio and Hannah separated and moved in,"" the Valley and Ada county sheriffs' offices said. Authorities ushered Hannah to an area where a helicopter could whisk her away. At some point, a ""confrontation"" ensued between authorities and DiMaggio, San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore said. The confrontation ended when an FBI tactical agent shot and killed the murder and kidnapping suspect. ""Obviously we would have liked for Mr. DiMaggio to surrender and face justice in the court of law,"" Gore said. ""But that's not going to be the case."" 'Hannah is safe' Hannah didn't appear to have significant physical injuries,but was immediately taken to a hospital, the sheriff's spokeswoman said. ""Hannah is safe, and that was our first priority from the very beginning,"" Valley County, Idaho, Sheriff Patti Bolen said. In his text to CNN, Brett Anderson expressed a range of emotions upon hearing of his daughter's rescue soon after his wife and son's death. ""I am nervous excited saddened 4 my wife and son and worried what my daughter has been through,"" he wrote. Father of missing teen pleads for daughter's release . Witness: DiMaggio had crush . A friend of Hannah Anderson detailed the relationship she observed between DiMaggio and the teen. Marissa Chavez told CNN that she was in a car with Hannah and DiMaggio, 40, a few months ago when he told Hannah he had a crush on her. He followed it up by saying if he was her age, he would date Hannah, Chavez said. Hannah was unnerved by the comments, but did not tell her mother because she did not want to ruin the close relationship that her parents had with DiMaggio, Chavez said. But Hannah did not want to be alone with DiMaggio after that, Chavez said. ""I don't think she would have gone willingly with him at all,"" she said. In an earlier episode, Chavez recalled a trip that DiMaggio and Hannah took to Hollywood. The trip was supposed to be for one week, but Hannah told Chavez that they came back after two days because DiMaggio was upset that she wasn't paying enough attention to him. Search intensified after car spotted . DiMaggio's car was found after John reported he had a brief conversation with two campers in the Idaho wilderness on Wednesday. Why more Amber alerts will be waking you up . DiMaggio's car was found unoccupied Friday -- hidden by brush, with its license plate removed -- spurring authorities to intensify their search in that area. Ultimately, DiMaggio was spotted and killed not far from where he left his car, said Andrea Dearden, spokeswoman for Idaho's Ada County sheriff's office. Father of missing teen pleads for daughter's release . From anguish to elation . Grief over the deaths of Hannah's mother and brother gave way to euphoria after the teen was found alive. ""We're very excited,"" Sara Britt, Hannah and Ethan's grandmother, said Sunday. ""Just ecstatic. Jubilation. We couldn't ask for anything more. This is the outcome we wanted."" But the outcome was also bittersweet for Britt and her husband, Ralph, who lost their daughter Christina and grandson Ethan in the ordeal. Asked whether she had any sense that DiMaggio might have been capable of the alleged crimes, Sara Britt said never. ""Even the way it turned out -- I mean he loved little E, and he loved my daughter, and for him to do such a horrific act, it's just not fathomable. I can't understand it because he loved them too,"" she said. Ralph Britt said he wants Christina to be remembered ""as a daughter and a mother of two great kids. That's it."" CNN's Gregg Canes, Miguel Marquez, AnneClaire Stapleton, Mariano Castillo and Alicia Eakin contributed to this report.","NEW: 16-year-old Hannah Anderson is reunited with her father .

"Vicksburg, Mississippi (CNN) -- Early signs of recovery mixed with stormy forecasts Friday, as residents struggled to dig out of the most significant flood to hit the lower Mississippi River valley in more than 70 years. In Tunica, Mississippi, two casinos reopened after being shut for almost three weeks because of the flooding, said Caesars Entertainment, the company that owns and operates them. But farther south, Vicksburg residents face a long and slow goodbye to the historic flood that submerged much of their city, forecasters said. They predicted that the river could remain out of its banks until at least mid-June. The Mississippi River is not expected to return to its 43-foot flood stage in Vicksburg until after June 14, which is 46 days after it climbed out of its banks, said Amanda Roberts, a National Weather Service hydrologist. It crested at 57.1 feet Thursday, and the weather service predicts the crest will hold through at least Saturday morning in Vicksburg. Severe storms are likely Saturday and Sunday in the Mississippi River, Ohio River and Tennessee River valleys, said CNN meteorologist Sean Morris. Up to 3 inches of rain per hour are possible, with heavier storms on Sunday. The rain could lead to secondary crests and higher crests along the Mississippi from Memphis, Tennessee, southward, he said. Some greeted the cresting floodwaters -- which have damaged hundreds of homes and displaced 2,000 Vicksburg residents -- with relief. Others celebrated. Eddie Monsour, who owns a waterfront restaurant, threw a ""River Crest Party"" on Thursday night. It was a big success, he said. ""Usually we've got a good crowd, but nothing like it is now. We're probably 200 people more than we usually are,"" Monsour told CNN affiliate WJTV. ""There's tourists here. People from all over the state just coming to see the water. They've never seen anything like it."" The patrons also included area evacuees such as Louise Roland of Eagle Lake. ""(I'm) just here to celebrate the river cresting,"" Roland said. ""Hopefully, it'll start going down soon."" All but about a dozen of Eagle Lake's 600 residents evacuated, according to CNN affiliate WLBT. ""We talked about it and thought about it, but this really wasn't a decision at all,"" one of the holdouts, Cindy Roberson, told WLBT. ""This is home. This is where our stuff is."" Local officials caution that some area residents may have to wait to return to their homes. Flooded houses pose a variety of dangers, they said. Rising floodwaters bring on debris, hazardous waste and gas leaks, and force snakes or other potentially dangerous animals from their habitats and into residential areas. ""Right now we're moving to the recovery stage,"" Vicksburg Mayor Paul Winfield told CNN. ""Our first priority, I believe, should be public safety, to continue to encourage our residents and onlookers to stay free of the water."" Law enforcement officials are patrolling evacuated areas to help ensure that abandoned homes and businesses aren't burglarized, Winfield said. And each flooded property must be assessed before an owner can return to it, he said. Residents who live along the river should be vigilant, said Marty Pope, a senior hydrologist with the weather service. Warren County, which includes Vicksburg, has ""several hundred homes that have water"" and about 2,000 residents have been displaced, Sheriff Martin Pace said. County residents are accustomed to flooding and know what to do, but none have experienced it at this magnitude, according to Pace. The river began cresting ahead of schedule Wednesday night, probably because an old levee system in the Mississippi city of Greenville was breached May 13 and spread the flood's flow, Pope said. The Mississippi River is more than 14 feet above flood stage at Vicksburg and more than a foot over the record set in the city in 1927. Water levels in Natchez, a city about 70 miles south, are nearly 4 feet beyond the record. The river stood at 61.9 feet Thursday night, and the crest isn't expected till Saturday. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers kept a watchful eye on the Yazoo Backwater Levee, which residents near Vicksburg were counting on. It is designed to keep water from backing into parts of the Yazoo River delta. A slide was detected on the mainline Mississippi levee at Albemarle Lake, the Corps of Engineers said Thursday. That occurs when the integrity of a levee is undermined because dirt and sand are being eroded, said spokeswoman Eileen Williamson. ""It will take about a full week to repair,"" she said. Farther south, where the Mississippi River has not yet crested, residents were working to clear out their homes and find ways to get by. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal has asked for federal assistance in grappling with flooding stemming from the Morganza Spillway, where 17 bays have been opened in hopes of sparing New Orleans farther downstream. So far, the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development has delivered nearly 150,000 sandbags, 30,000 cubic yards of sand and 33,000 linear feet of fabric-lined baskets, the governor's office said. Approximately 1,150 Louisiana National Guard members have been mobilized. Mandatory evacuations will be in effect Saturday -- beginning at midnight Friday -- in Butte La Rose, Happy Town and the Sherburne Wildlife Management Area, the St. Martin Parish Sheriff's Office said. By Saturday morning, ""the area will be secured and no one will be allowed to enter,"" the parish said in a news release. Officials said spillway gates are likely to be open for weeks. It will be weeks before the river falls below flood stage, allowing evacuees to return. About five miles of the Mississippi River at Baton Rouge were closed Friday after four barges broke loose from a towboat, said Seaman William Benson of the U.S. Coast Guard. Three of the four sank. Benson declined to say whether the recent flooding could have had anything to do with the incident, but said an investigation was under way. The flood is the most significant to hit the lower Mississippi River valley since at least 1937. It has affected nine states so far: Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Ohio, Indiana, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- AEG dropped its claim Monday for a $17.5 million insurance policy for Michael Jackson, just days after e-mails revealed the concert promoter had doubts about Jackson's health at the time they were applying for the insurance. AEG lawyer Marvin Putnam told CNN later Monday the move has been in the works for months and is not connected with the controversy over the e-mails. A Lloyds of London underwriter sued AEG and Michael Jackson LLC after Jackson's death, claiming they failed to disclose information about the pop star's health and drug use. ""In exchange for AEG withdrawing its insurance claim, underwriters agreed to dismiss AEG from the case and to waive any costs recoverable from AEG,"" said Paul Schrieffer, attorney for the insurance underwriter. ""The insurance case continues against the Michael Jackson Company LLC for, among other things, rescission of the policy due to nondisclosures of Michael Jackson's prior drug use."" Source of leaked Michael Jackson e-mails identified . The Michael Jackson estate, which controls Michael Jackson Company LLC, is still pursuing the insurance payout, its lawyer said Monday. Jackson died of an overdose of a surgical anesthesia in combination with sedatives on June 25, 2009, according the the Los Angeles County coroner. Dr. Conrad Murray was found guilty last year of involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's death. A controversy over the insurance claim erupted last week after the Los Angeles Times published e-mails which the insurance lawyer said had not been provided to him despite a year of discovery in the case. Randy Phillips, the president of AEG Live -- the concert-promotion branch of AEG -- called Jackson's death ""a terrible tragedy"" in one e-mail written weeks after he died, adding ""but life must go on."" ""AEG will make a fortune from merch sales, ticket retention, the touring exhibition and the film/dvd,"" Phillips wrote. In fact, AEG Live was allowed to sell Jackson tour merchandise and share in the profits from the documentary ""This Is It,"" produced from rehearsal video. The e-mails suggest AEG Live's president saw Jackson's problems first-hand the day the pop star was to appear at the O2 Arena to publicly announce the shows. ""MJ is locked in his room drunk and despondent,"" Phillips wrote in a March 5, 2009, e-mail to AEG Live's parent company, the paper reported. ""I (am) trying to sober him up."" ""I screamed at him so loud the walls are shaking,"" Phillips wrote. ""He is an emotionally paralyzed mess riddled with self-loathing and doubt now that it is show time."" The promoter blamed London traffic when Jackson was 90 minutes late for the announcement that day. ""He's as healthy as he can be -- no health problems whatsoever,"" Phillips told CNN two months later to refute reports Jackson's health was threatening the concerts. The Los Angeles Times story, however, said the e-mails indicated major doubts about Jackson's ability to perform. ""We cannot be forced into stopping this, which MJ will try to do because he is lazy and constantly changes his mind to fit his immediate wants,"" AEG Live executive Paul Gongaware e-mailed to Phillips. Jackson's missed rehearsals in June triggered concerns in e-mails that he was slow in learning his dance routines and would have to lip-sync on stage, the newspaper reported. ""MJ is not in shape enough yet to sing this stuff live and dance at the same time,"" one e-mail from the show's music director read, the paper reported. A production manager wrote: ""He was a basket case. Doubt is pervasive."" A loud warning from show director Kenny Ortega, who worked closely with Jackson on previous tours, came in mid-June, just over a week before his death. Ortega wrote to Phillips that Jackson had ""strong signs of paranoia, anxiety and obsessive-like behavior"" and suggesting they bring a ""top psychiatrist in to evaluate him ASAP."" Previously on CNN.com: Jackson family drama . ""It is like there are two people there. One (deep inside) trying to hold on to what he was and still can be and not wanting us to quit him, the other in this weakened and troubled state,"" Ortega wrote. ""I believe we need professional guidance in this matter."" Ortega testified at Murray's trial about his concerns about Jackson's frail condition and missed rehearsals. It resulted in a meeting six days before Jackson's death in which Murray assured the promoters he would have Jackson ready for rehearsals that next week. An e-mail from Phillips after that meeting said he had confidence in Murray ""who I am gaining immense respect for as I get to deal with him more."" ""This doctor is extremely successful (we check everyone out) and does not need this gig, so he (is) totally unbiased and ethical,"" Phillips' e-mail said. A wrongful-death lawsuit, filed by Jackson's mother and his three children, contends that AEG contributed to the pop star's death by pressuring him to prepare even though the promoters knew he was in a weak condition and by its hiring and supervision of Dr. Murray. ""Defendants did not hire Dr. Murray nor were they responsible for the death of Michael Jackson,"" AEG lawyer Putnam told CNN last week. AEG's lawyer accused Katherine Jackson, the children and their lawyers of leaking the e-mails to a reporter, in violation of a court order, despite a claim of responsibility by someone else. Howard Mann, who partnered with Katherine Jackson on a book about her family, acknowledged to CNN last week that he gave the documents to Times reporter Harriet Ryan. Mann was involved in a bitter copyright dispute concerning that book with Jackson's estate at the time he gave the reporter the documents, but the lawsuit was settled last week. Mann said he obtained the documents from various sources, but none of them came from the Jacksons or their lawyers. Some of the documents were part of discovery in other cases, including the criminal trial of Murray, he said. AEG lawyer Marvin Putnam, who said Tuesday that he had ""unequivocal evidence"" showing that Michael Jackson's mother and her lawyers leaked the e-mails, has asked the judge in the wrongful-death suit to punish Katherine Jackson with fines and exclude the e-mails as evidence in the case. ""The documents released to the press were given to Mrs. Jackson and her attorneys -- and to no one else -- confidentially in discovery and subject to a court order,"" Putnam said Tuesday. On Thursday, he called it ""convenient that Howard Mann -- a longtime business partner of the Jackson family -- has come forward in this fashion."" AEG served a subpoena on Mann, ordering him to testify under oath about the source of the e-mails, on Friday, Putnam said. ""Whether these documents were leaked through an intermediary or directly by Mrs. Jackson and her counsel, this remains an egregious violation of the court's order requiring immediate sanctions and an investigation,"" the AEG lawyer said. Putnam accused Jackson and her lawyers of leaking the documents -- despite that their ""publication hurts her son's memory and her grandchildren more than anyone else"" -- because they ""know they cannot win on the law and are losing control over the case."" ""After months of discovery, plaintiffs now know what we have known all along -- there is nothing to support their claims,"" the AEG lawyer said. Jackson lawyer Kevin Boyle said the admission by Mann that he was the source of the e-mails should settle the matter. ""He (Mann) definitely never received any documents from Katherine, Prince, Paris, or Blanket Jackson, nor from their lawyers in the wrongful death suit against AEG,"" said Jackson lawyer Kevin Boyle. Prince, Paris and Blanket Jackson are Michael Jackson's children. Boyle criticized AEG's lawyers for their haste in pointing the finger at the Jacksons. ""AEG made these accusations against the Jackson family and their lawyers apparently without doing even the most rudimentary investigation,"" Boyle said. ""We are further disturbed that the motion for sanctions filed by AEG was given to the press before it was served on Katherine Jackson or her counsel.""","NEW: AEG's decision is not connected with the e-mail controversy, it's lawyer says .

"(CNN) -- The remains of a Saudi national killed in airstrikes in Yemen earlier this month are not those of a wanted al Qaeda bomb-maker, according to multiple sources in Saudi Arabia who were briefed on the matter. DNA tests conducted by Saudi officials showed that the remains were not those of Ibrahim al-Asiri, they said. Saudi officials had obtained a close match to al-Asiri's DNA via remains of his brother, who died in a failed suicide bomb attack. The brother had carried a bomb inside his body, which killed him upon detonation but failed to hit his intended target, Saudi Arabia's security chief. The sources said that the results were also negative for a DNA match to Nasser al-Wuhayshi, believed to be head of al Qaeda in the Arabian Pennisula. Al-Wuhayshi has been referred to as the ""crown prince"" of the global terror organization al Qaeda. Crackdown . The laboratory tests were conducted to determine whether a broad offensive against AQAP, which is considered al Qaeda's most dangerous wing, had eliminated the two men. The crackdown began over a week ago, resulting in the deaths of more than 60 suspected al Qaeda militants in Yemen from April 19 t0 21, Yemeni officials have said. Operations have included attacks by Yemeni commandos and suspected U.S. drone strikes, a high-level Yemeni government official said. U.S. special operations troops helped during that offensive, in part by flying Yemeni forces to a remote, mountainous spot in southern Yemen, though no Americans took part in combat, a U.S. official said. Terror threats . One reason Yemen and the United States partnered in the offensive: Threats from al Qaeda operatives in Yemen increased in recent weeks. U.S. authorities blame the Yemen-based branch of al Qaeda for a string of plots against Americans, including the failed attempt to blow up a U.S.-bound jetliner with a bomb concealed in an operative's underwear in 2009. It is also suspected of being behind another plot involving printer bombs on U.S.-bound cargo jets.

"(CNN) -- Authorities investigating a shooting at Los Angeles International Airport asked for patience Saturday as they piece together details of the rampage that left a Transportation Security Administration officer dead. The statement released jointly by federal and local authorities came one day after The Associated Press, citing two unnamed law enforcement officials, reported the slain TSA officer lay bleeding for 33 minutes because police had not declared the terminal safe for paramedics to enter. Authorities have charged Paul Ciancia, 29, in the death of TSA officer Gerardo Hernandez, who was shot in the chest and abdomen during the November 1 shooting at Terminal 3. The joint statement did not directly address the AP report, but it defended the actions of authorities that day. ""Command officers and airport administrators were faced with a wide range of important objectives, including conducting a complete search to rule out additional gunmen or explosives, identifying and treating all injured victims, and coordinating the needs of the thousands of arriving and departing travelers that were impacted by the incident,"" the statement said. Federal and local authorities will offer no further comment beyond the statement while the investigation is ongoing, said LAPD spokeswoman Sally Madera. The AP reported that while it was unknown when Hernandez died, officials were examining whether paramedics, who were reportedly held 150 yards away from the terminal by police, could have gone in earlier. ""Various statements have been made regarding the incident, some of which are untrue and others that merit serious consideration by our respective agencies,"" the Saturday statement said. ""Numerous actions are underway relative to this incident and the ensuing response."" According to the joint statement, authorities are conducting a federal criminal investigation and an officer-involved shooting investigation. An after-action work group is also analyzing all aspects of the ""multidiscipline response."" Key findings of the investigations will be released when they are completed, it said. Hernandez, 39, was the first TSA officer killed in the line of duty in the agency's 12-year-history. According to authorities, Ciancia walked up to the TSA checkpoint where Hernandez was working and opened fire, shooting him ""at point-blank range,"" according to a court document. Ciancia then went up an escalator toward the security checkpoint, but returned to shoot Hernandez again after apparently seeing the officer move, the document said. The rampage came to an end when authorities shot and wounded Ciancia, who has been charged with the murder of a federal officer and commission of violence at an international airport.","AP is reporting that a TSA officer killed during a shooting at LAX lay bleeding for 33 minutes .

"(CNN) -- It took more than 3Â½ decades, but Victoria Montenegro has finally recovered the remains of her father, and in doing so, her identity. The Argentinian mother of three, who lives in Buenos Aires, this week received confirmation that a body found in a Uruguayan cemetery is that of her father, Roque Orlando Montenegro, who disappeared in 1976 when she was just a few days old. It's a story about the depths of repression reached during Argentina's so-called Dirty War from 1976 to 1983. Thousands of people, mainly leftists, trade unionists, students, Marxists and their sympathizers, were targeted by the military regime that took power in March 1976 and even before then. Some were executed; many others simply were never heard from again. Victoria Montenegro had been seeking the truth about her father since she learned in the year 2000, when she was 24 years old, that the military couple who raised her were not her biological parents. ""I was appropriated,"" Montenegro says, using the term given to children whose parents were killed or disappeared during the Dirty War and were given to other couples. The organization known as Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo (May Square Grandmothers), helped her find the truth about her identity. The organization helps people, who were taken away from their politically persecuted parents as children, reconnect with their past. Guillermo Wulff, a spokesman with Abuelas, says that for Montenegro, learning the truth wasn't easy. ""It took a long time for her to accept it; but when she did, she was then ready for the next step, which was finding out how her parents died,"" Wulff said. The Argentinian Forensic Anthropology Team (EAAF by its Spanish acronym) announced this week that forensic and DNA tests prove that human remains found in a Uruguayan cemetery are those of Roque Orlando Montenegro, known as ""Toti,"" who went missing in February 1976 when he was 20 years old. Luis Fondevrider, president of EAAF, said that identifying the remains of Montenegro was a process that started 10 years ago in Colonia, Uruguay, across the Rio de La Plata from Buenos Aires. ""In 2002 we exhumed eight unidentified bodies from the cemetery in Colonia. At that time, we had no hypothesis as to how the bodies ended up there,"" said Fondevrider. EAAF took DNA and forensic samples from the bodies. In 2007, the independent organization started taking blood and DNA samples from people in Argentina with missing relatives. Victoria Montenegro was one of 8,500 people who left samples over the following four years. Finally, a match was made this year. But how did the body of a man kidnapped in Buenos Aires end up in a different country? Fondevrider believes Montenegro was killed during the so-called ""death flights,"" a series of military flights in which political prisoners were thrown alive into the sea. Montenegro's body probably washed ashore on the Uruguayan coast. A nameless tombstone was placed over his grave in Colonia. For Victoria Montenegro, seeking the truth about her origins has been a slow and painful process, but she says knowing what truly happened has given her some closure. ""Recovering my true identity was paramount,"" Montenegro said. ""Having a true identity is a human right. Recovering the remains of my father has been important not only to understand how he died, but also to bring some justice to Argentina and the victims of the regime."" Montenegro says her rendezvous with her past is only halfway done. Her adoptive parents, whom she calls ""my appropriators,"" told her both of her biological parents had died in a Buenos Aires shootout in February 1976. She has no knowledge or clues about what happened to her mother. Her adoptive parents are deceased. She called it ""a miracle"" that the Godmothers organization found her and, ""with a drop of my blood, was able to identify the remains of my father, buried in Uruguay since 1976."" Now with a son who, at 20, is as old as her father was when he disappeared, Montenegro said she hopes the episode shines a little more light on a dark past. ""As painful as it may be, we need to find the truth about our history,"" she said. ""By exhuming and identifying our loved ones after all these years, we give them back their dignity.""","Victoria Montenegro, 36, learned of her real father just 12 years ago .

"(CNN) -- This month, just outside of Houston, a man police say had a history of abusing and threatening women got his hands on a gun and executed six members of his ex-wife's family -- including four children. On that day, local law enforcement officials believe he was on his way to hunt down other family members when, thankfully, they ended his rampage. In our country, it's a sadly common story: An abuser or stalker gains access to guns and destroys the lives of women and families in our communities. That's why it is time for Congress to address this lethal mix of domestic violence and guns. Our leaders must pass laws that prevent stalkers and abusers from accessing guns to intimidate, hurt or kill women. Domestic violence: The next front in gun control fight . The numbers should shock you: Women in America are 11 times more likely to be murdered with a gun than women in other democratic countries with developed economies. In domestic abuse situations, if the abuser has access to a gun, it increases the chance that a woman will die by 500%. Most of the time, women are murdered with guns by someone they know, either by a family member or an intimate partner, such as a former or current husband or boyfriend. Between 2001 and 2012, more women were shot to death by an intimate partner in our country than the total number of American troops killed in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined. That is a national shame. Fortunately, the momentum is on our side. On Wednesday, the Senate will hold its first-ever hearing on domestic violence homicides and the use of gun violence against America's women. Many of our elected leaders are calling for new protections for those who are subject to abuse. States are already taking bipartisan action. And Americans support these laws by staggering margins. Keeping weapons from mentally ill proves elusive . Currently, federal law prevents people who are under domestic violence protection orders or have misdemeanor domestic violence convictions from accessing guns. But even though increasing numbers of couples are choosing to marry later in life, the law hasn't been extended to address dating partner abuse. And convicted stalkers can still get guns. Common sense says that these dangerous loopholes should be closed now. Congress has the power to do it. Those who argue that stalkers don't necessarily exhibit violent or threatening behavior haven't been on the other side of a conversation with a woman who fears for her life because her former boyfriend or acquaintance is promising to find her and kill her. The reality is three out of four women killed by their intimate partner were stalked before their death. We must continue to educate those who don't understand why we need these protections for abused women. Democrats and Republicans in state legislatures around the country recognize the problem and have come together to pass laws that better protect women from gun violence. This year alone, leaders in six states -- Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Washington and Wisconsin -- have enacted legislation with overwhelming bipartisan support that will help protect abused women from gun violence. Faced with laws that don't do enough to keep guns away from domestic abusers and stalkers, Democrats and Republicans chose common-sense change over the status quo. Opinion: I'm a gun owner and I want gun control . Our leaders in Washington should follow their example and back legislation that prohibits stalkers and dating abusers from having guns. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, a former prosecutor, has a bill that would do just that. It is the responsible thing to do. Keeping guns out of the hands of abusers and stalkers will take more than a Senate hearing and carefully worded statements that say all the right things. It will require our leaders to show some courage and stand up for common-sense laws. It will require some hard work. And it will require overcoming the power of those in Washington who continue to fight against these laws. But we urgently need stronger gun laws that protect women. We can't wait any longer. Women's lives are at stake. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.","Gabrielle Giffords, Katie Ray-Jones: Congress must address domestic violence and guns .
