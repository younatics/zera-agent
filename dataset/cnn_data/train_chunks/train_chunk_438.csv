"At the height of his power, Zhou Yongkang controlled police forces, spy agencies, court systems and prosecution offices across China -- and the domestic security czar wasn't shy in deploying his vast assets to crush dissent and unrest in the name of ""preserving social stability."" During his reign before retiring in 2012, as worsening income inequality and official corruption fueled mass discontent nationwide, Zhou oversaw the domestic security budget swell to surpass that of the two million-strong Chinese military -- the world's largest. As a member of the ruling Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee -- China's top decision-making body -- Zhou was one of nine men who effectively ruled the country of more than 1.3 billion people. Away from the spotlight, though, Zhou and his family members were reportedly taking advantage of his leadership position to accumulate enormous wealth. The allegedly blatant exchange between money and power, as revealed by China's state media, would eventually prompt Zhou's shocking downfall last summer. After months of intense political rumors, the Communist Party's disciplinary arm in late July announced an official investigation into Zhou for ""serious disciplinary violations."" On Friday, state prosecutors alleged the investigation found that Zhou, 71, had taken advantage of his positions to garner profits for others, and had ""accepted huge bribes personally and through his family."" Zhou was also expelled from the Communist Party, according to state news agency Xinhua, citing a decision made Friday at a meeting of the party central committee's political bureau. Anti-corruption campaign . Many have viewed his fall from grace as a watershed moment in the secretive world of Chinese politics now ruled by President Xi Jinping, who has been spearheading a massive anti-corruption campaign ostensibly targeting ""tigers and flies"" -- high-ranking and low-level officials -- alike. ""The important thing here is that Xi has proven he's powerful enough to break this taboo of never incriminating former Politburo Standing Committee members,"" said longtime political analyst Willy Lam with Chinese University of Hong Kong. Unlike Xi, who is ""Communist royalty"" thanks to his father's status as one of Chairman Mao's comrades in arms during the revolution, Zhou was born to a poor family in eastern China. His father was an illiterate farmer but borrowed money to send him to school. Smart and hardworking, Zhou didn't disappoint and went on to become one of the few local students admitted into an elite university in Beijing. That school, now called China University of Petroleum, was the cradle for titans in the state oil industry. After graduating with a degree in oil exploration, Zhou was assigned to an oil field in the country's northeast and rose through the official ranks from the late 1960s through the mid-1980s. Described by many as a capable and humbling young party cadre, Zhou was remembered more for his political savviness than technical knowledge. His political skill shone when he was transferred to the oil ministry in Beijing, which later became a giant state-owned oil company and one of Zhou's power bases. Decisive leader . Overcoming factional wars in the ministry, Zhou was said to be a decisive leader who focused on expanding domestic oil exploration as well as overseas projects, a two-pronged strategy that would continue to this day. Fast growth of business abroad made supervision from Beijing harder, sowing the seeds for corruption. In 2001, after a stint as minister of land resources, Zhou was named the Communist Party chief of Sichuan in southwest China, one of the country's most populous provinces. State media there portrayed Zhou as an eloquent leader with a clear vision, and credited him for luring high-tech companies including Intel to the southwestern province, as well as modernizing the agriculture and tourism sectors. Zhou also developed strong local ties and planted officials loyal to him -- including secretaries he brought from Beijing -- in key postings throughout the province. Zhou's big break came in 2002 when he returned to Beijing and was put in charge of the ministry of public security, which runs the country's police forces. Five years later, he rose to the apex of power by taking a seat in the nine-member Politburo Standing Committee -- with an expanded portfolio that covered all domestic security affairs. His reign coincided with a time of mounting social and ethnic unrest as well as such major events as the Beijing Olympics in 2008, the 60th anniversary of the People's Republic in 2009 and the World Expo in Shanghai in 2010. Ruthless hardliner . As the leadership prioritized security and stability above all else, Zhou greatly expanded police power at the expense of already-limited judicial independence, cementing his reputation as a ruthless hardliner among political dissidents and activists. It was also during this period that Zhou became a patron of Bo Xilai, a fast-rising political star who was waging his own controversial war against organized crime in the southwestern metropolis of Chongqing. Bo's spectacular downfall in 2012 -- complete with tales of murder, bribery and betrayal -- attracted global attention. State media cited his subsequent conviction on corruption charges as a prime example of Xi's resolve to clean up the party. Bo supporters, however, have long called him a political victim as the former high-flying politician was once considered Xi's main challenger for the top spot of Chinese leadership. Political activists and observers now note the similarity between the Bo and Zhou cases. ""Zhou challenged Xi's authority and threatened his rule -- that's why he's now being held responsible along with his gangs,"" offered Hu Jia, one of China's leading political dissidents, who was thrown into prison for more than three years on ""subversion"" charges when Zhou first took over nationwide law enforcement. ""The bottom line is: All officials are corrupt,"" he added. ""Xi can't find a better excuse to rid of his political opponents than fighting corruption -- something that helps him win the masses' hearts and minds. ""The people being investigated for corruption are on the losing side of factional struggles,"" echoed Lam, the Hong Kong analyst. ""People who are close to Xi are less liable to becoming incriminated."" Zhou's family, aides probed . Those close to Zhou have fallen with him. State media have reported official investigations -- and formal arrests in some cases -- into dozens of Zhou's family members and former aides. The biggest impact was felt in the domestic security apparatus, state oil industry and Sichuan province -- three places Zhou once ruled. Details have also emerged in Chinese media about possible skeletons in Zhou's closet, including the suspicious circumstances surrounding the death of his first wife. Most stories, though, have focused on the vast wealth amassed by Zhou's older son as well as his two brothers and their families. The Zhous reportedly benefited immensely from China's booming energy and real estate sectors thanks to Zhou's deep ties to the two related ministries. Zhou's older son, who is 42, is said to own multiple luxury properties worth millions of dollars. Before even turning 30, the younger Zhou's first foray into business met with fast growth and quick success after winning a contract to upgrade IT systems for 8,000 gas stations across China. His companies also reportedly reaped huge financial gain from buying and selling oil fields and hydropower stations. State media reports also indicated that one of Zhou's younger brothers, a onetime farmer, used Zhou's influence to launch a ""crisis management"" business and profited from helping people get out of jail, enter police academy and sell steel pipes to state-owned oil fields. Other published articles have painted an intricate web of officials, cronies and tycoons -- some with alleged mafia connections -- orbiting around the domestic security czar before the crumbling of his power structure. ""I think, unlike Bo Xilai, Zhou Yongkang will cooperate with investigators because his family is involved,"" said analyst Lam, predicting a suspended death sentence for both Zhou and his older son. ""His only incentive now is to protect his son -- he will toe the line to protect his son.""","Zhou arrested as part of corruption probe, expelled from Communist Party .

"George Clooney tried to rally support for Sony in the midst of a severe cyberattack on the studio, but the actor and filmmaker says he couldn't find anyone to stand with him. In an interview with Deadline Hollywood, Clooney says he circulated a letter asking top Hollywood figures to show their support for the embattled studio. The letter called for the industry to ""fully support Sony's decision not to submit to these hackers' demands,"" and to acknowledge ""that to give in to these criminals now will open the door for any group that would threaten freedom of expression, privacy and personal liberty. We hope these hackers are brought to justice but until they are, we will not stand in fear. We will stand together."" In essence, the letter was ""basically saying ... 'We're not going to give in to a ransom,' "" Clooney told Deadline. ""As we watched one group be completely vilified, nobody stood up. Nobody took that stand."" As far as his petition, Clooney couldn't land a single signature. The hack of Sony Pictures first came to light in November, and in the weeks since has developed into a devastating saga that's included leaked Social Security numbers and health information, embarrassing emails from studio execs and a threat that's led to Sony canceling its release of ""The Interview."" The movie, which stars stars Seth Rogen and James Franco, has a plot that involves a plan to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. U.S. officials believe the attack on Sony was ordered by North Korea's leadership. U.S. set to blame North Korea for Sony hack . To George Clooney, this isn't just about Sony, or the celebrity gossip that's emerged. ""We're talking about an actual country deciding what content we're going to have,"" he told Deadline. ""This affects not just movies, this affects every part of business that we have."" ""What happens if a newsroom decides to go with a story, and a country or an individual or corporation decides they don't like it? Forget the hacking part of it. You have someone threaten to blow up buildings, and all of a sudden everybody has to bow down. ""Sony didn't pull the movie because they were scared; they pulled the movie because all the theaters said they were not going to run it. And they said they were not going to run it because they talked to their lawyers and those lawyers said if somebody dies in one of these, then you're going to be responsible."" That sense of hesitation and fear was evident to the actor as he tried to drum up support for the studio. Clooney wouldn't mention names, but he did say that ""nobody wanted to be the first to sign on."" ""This isn't finger-pointing,"" he continued. ""This is just where we are right now, how scared this industry has been made. Quite honestly, this would happen in any industry. I don't know what the answer is, but what happened here is part of a much larger deal. ... And people are still talking about dumb emails. Understand what is going on right now, because the world just changed on your watch, and you weren't even paying attention."" Clooney isn't the only actor unnerved by the fallout from the Sony hack. As news spread Wednesday that the studio would not be releasing ""The Interview,"" in theaters or anywhere else, a number of celebrities came forward to express their frustration. Celebrities criticize decision to pull 'The Interview' ""I think it is disgraceful that these theaters are not showing The Interview. Will they pull any movie that gets an anonymous threat now?"" actor and filmmaker Judd Apatow tweeted. ""Wow. Everyone caved. The hackers won. An utter and complete victory for them,"" added Rob Lowe. ""Game of Thrones"" author George R.R. Martin has even offered to screen the film at his independent theater in Santa Fe, New Mexico, should the movie be made available. In a blog post titled ""Corporate Cowardice,"" Martin took aim at the theater chains that declined to screen ""The Interview,"" causing Sony to shelve the film. ""I mean, really?"" Martin wrote. ""These gigantic corporations, most of which could buy North Korea with pocket change, are declining to show a film because Kim Jong-Un objects to being mocked? The level of corporate cowardice here astonishes me."" ""The Interview"" was intended to open Christmas Day as a lighthearted option for holiday crowds. But while ""The Interview"" may once have been just ""a silly comedy,"" ""what it now says about us is a whole lot,"" Clooney said. ""We have a responsibility to stand up against this.""","George Clooney created a petition in support of Sony .

"Attorney Gloria Allred challenged comedian Bill Cosby, hounded by allegations of sexual assault, to meet his accusers in court or set aside $100 million to settle their claims. ""The public deserves to know if Mr. Cosby is a saint or a sexual predator,"" Allred said. Because many of the claims of sexual assault are decades old, Cosby would have to agree to waive the statute of limitations, allowing his accusers to sue him. ""It could be advantageous for Mr. Cosby to give up the statute of limitations because there is a huge cloud on his reputation and legacy,"" Allred said on Wednesday. But she also offered a second option. Cosby could put $100 million into a fund and anyone who claims she was a victim could file and have a panel of retired judges decide the merits of the case and award compensation. ""We challenge Mr. Cosby to end this nightmare for both him and the alleged victims by accepting either of the options,"" Allred said. There was no immediate response from Cosby's lawyer Martin D. Singer. Allred made the offer at a news conference flanked by three women who say they were sexually assaulted by the entertainer.  Two of them represent new accusers. Two of the women allege they were drugged by Cosby and sexually assaulted in the 1980s. A third woman said Cosby followed her and her friends around at a celebrity tennis tournament in 1973.  She said he later grabbed her right breast at a restaurant. Bill Cosby has defenders . A lawsuit . The latest allegations came a day after another women, Judy Huth, filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court, claiming sexual battery and infliction of emotional distress during an incident at the Playboy Mansion, according to the documents first obtained by Radar Online. The alleged sexual assault took place in 1974 when Huth was 15 years old. According to court documents, Huth and a 16-year-old friend met Cosby when he was filming a movie at Lacy Park in Los Angeles. After talking with the girls, the suit alleges, Cosby invited them to his tennis club the following Saturday, ""where he served them alcoholic beverages and played games of billiards."" They then went to the Playboy Mansion where, the lawsuit says, Cosby asked Huth to sit on a bed beside him, after she came out of a bathroom. ""He then proceeded to sexually molest her by attempting to put his hand down her pants, and then taking her hand in his hand and performing a sex act on himself without her consent."" In a pleading filed Thursday, Cosby attorney Martin D. Singer said Huth's claims are ""absolutely false"" and accused her of engaging in extortion after Cosby rejected her ""outrageous demand for money in order not to make her allegations public."" ""Through her lawyer, Plaintiff made extortionate threats to Mr. Cosby (through his counsel) about criminal penalties, coupled with ever-increasing demands for a six-figure payday to keep quiet about her long-since expired claims,"" Singer said. Singer added that Huth claimed she didn't remember the abuse until recently -- which he said in some cases could provide for an exception to the statute of limitations -- but tried to sell the story to a media outlet 10 years ago. He asked the court to impose monetary sanctions of $33,295 in court and legal fees. CNN has tried to contact Huth and her attorneys but has not heard back from them either. Cosby facing litany of allegations . 'Horrible, horrendous allegations' The suit goes on to call Cosby's alleged actions ""malicious, oppressive and fraudulent in nature."" ""This traumatic incident, at such a tender age, has caused psychological damage and mental anguish for (Huth) that has caused her significant problems throughout her life since the incident."" The case describes the damage as ""substantial and continuing."" Huth is asking for damages and legal fees. Because four decades have passed since the alleged crime, it wasn't immediately clear if the case falls within the statute of limitations in California for child sex abuse. It's because of that lag in time that CNN legal analyst Joey Jackson says he thinks Cosby's legal team will ask for the lawsuit to be dismissed. ""It's highly problematic, and it's likely the lawsuit will not stand,"" he said. With the allegations mounting, CNN political contributor Van Jones said that now is the time for Cosby to speak up. ""At some point, his silence becomes almost kind of an admission,"" he said. ""These are horrible, horrendous allegations."" Cosby has not commented on the allegations, leaving that to his lawyer. In a recent statement, Singer said it defies common sense that ""so many people would have said nothing, done nothing, and made no reports to law enforcement or asserted civil claims if they thought they had been assaulted over a span of so many years."" By CNN's count, at least 20 women have gone public with accusations. ""He owes this country. He owes his fans. He owes the women some kind of statement,"" said Jones, who is also an attorney. ""I think this level of silence for this long is unfair to everybody."" Another allegation . Huth's lawsuit was filed on the same day that The Daily Beast published a story in which a man named Tony Hogue alleges he rescued a female friend from Cosby's New York brownstone in 1984. The article describes Hogue beating on the comedian's front door after receiving a frantic phone call from the woman, who said, ""Tony, you've got to come get me."" After Cosby answered the door, the story says, Hogue found his friend on the second floor of the home. ""She looked drugged and in a fog, and she couldn't snap out of it,"" he said. ""She was a mess."" The Daily Beast reports this same woman was a witness in a sex assault lawsuit against Cosby, filed in 2005. That case was settled before going to trial.","Attorney Gloria Allred asks Bill Cosby to waive statute of limitations .

"Is the era of 5G connectivity upon us? The government in South Korea says so, and it's sinking $1.5 billion into upgrades it says will make mobile communications there 1,000 times faster than they are today. But not so fast. Literally, not so fast. As was the case when smartphones and other mobile devices first started having 4G slapped on them, the term 5G is as much a marketing slogan as anything else -- at this point, anyway. And if technophiles in the United States are hoping Korea's announcement means warp-speed data connections are coming their way in the near future, they're going to be disappointed. Regardless of the network's capabilities, any wireless carrier wanting to take advantage of them also would need costly upgrades to their systems. Users would have to purchase new devices that could access it. And even then, there's no guarantee that Netflix or similar companies would make their own data available at speeds that live up to the Korean government's tantalizing vision of an entire movie downloading in a single second. All that said, don't count Korea out. Arguably the most wired country in the world, South Korea has led in mobile adoption since the 1990s. ""We helped fuel national growth with 2G services in the 1990s, 3G in the 2000s and 4G around 2010. Now it is time to take preemptive action to develop 5G,"" the nation's science ministry said. ""Countries in Europe, China and the US are making aggressive efforts to develop 5G technology ... and we believe there will be fierce competition in this market in a few years."" A worldwide high of 82.7% of South Koreans use the Internet, and 78.5% of the nation's population is on smartphones. Narrow that down to 18-24 year olds and it's dangerously close to full saturation -- 97.7%. The science ministry's plan is realistically measured. A trial 5G network is due to be rolled out in 2017, with full rollout in 2020. The country's telecom companies, as well as native mobile companies Samsung and LG, are on board and plan to be ready to take advantage of the network, according to the government statement. Eventually, of course, 5G will hit the U.S. and elsewhere. Remember, the difference between 3G and 4G and 5G is somewhat semantic. Significantly upgrade what we have now and you can add a number before the G. But we'll no doubt be behind. Korea's compact geography and existing wireless infrastructure mean that upgrades can happen faster and cheaper, and will reach more of the population than in geographically spread-out countries like the United States. The increasing number of smartphones and tablets used in the United States is already beginning to tax existing communications networks. Add an emerging wearable tech trend and connected appliances like smart thermostats, refrigerators and smoke detectors, and experts expect the U.S. will need a serious upgrade by 2020 as well. Each generation of network technology has enabled a new set of features: 2G was about voice, 3G was about data and 4G is about video. 5G is expected to be about creating intelligent networks that can handle those billions of connected devices.","South Korea says they're spending $1.5 billion on a ""5G"" network .

"Albuquerque, New Mexico (CNN)Two Albuquerque, New Mexico, police officers will face first-degree murder charges in last year's shooting of a homeless man in the hills above the city, a prosecutor announced Monday. Keith Sandy and Dominique Perez were ordered to appear at a preliminary hearing, the date of which has not yet been set, said District Attorney Kari Brandenburg of New Mexico's Second Judicial Circuit. Sandy and Perez are accused of killing James Boyd in March. The 38-year-old homeless man spent the night before his shooting in a shelter, but when the shelter closed for the winter, Boyd tried to camp in the hills above the city, officials said. Overnight camping in the hills is illegal. Helmet and body cameras worn by dozens of city police who converged on the campsite showed Boyd with two small camping knives in his hands. Over several hours, Boyd talked with officers, at one point claiming to be ""the Department of Defense."" The cameras captured officers converging on a small nest of rocks on the hillside. At one point, Boyd turned his back to the officers and they began firing. Officers fired a shotgun and nonlethal beanbag pellets at Boyd, while other officers were caught on camera throwing flash-bang grenades. The video also shows one officer unleashing his K-9 German shepherd against Boyd. The helmet cameras show Boyd wheezing for breath after the attack. He died later at a local hospital. Do police videos tell the whole truth? Sandy retired from the department in December of 2014, an Albuquerque police spokesman said. It's unclear if Perez is still on the force. Local activists have demonstrated for months, protesting not only the Boyd shooting, but other shootings by city police officers since 2010. Records show that 26 civilians have been shot, a dozen of them fatally, by city police since 2010. Before Monday, no officer had been charged in connection with any shootings. The Justice Department in April 2014 found that ""there is reason to believe"" the city's Police Department had a ""pattern and practice"" of excessive force. The city has since agreed to a memorandum of understanding allowing the Department of Justice to monitor the department.","Keith Sandy and Dominique Perez have been charged in James Boyd's 2014 death .

"(CNN)I recently read seven words that shook me to the core. In a mesmerizing interview  in the new Smithsonian magazine, the civil rights historian Taylor Branch describes the three Freedom Riders who were killed in Mississippi 50 summers ago. All three had understood the dangers of going into the Deep South to register black voters. All had been trained in the practice of radical nonviolence. One of them, Michael Schwerner, lived out that ethic as he faced the gun-wielding Klansman who was about to murder him. Schwerner said to the man, calmly, ""Sir, I know just how you feel."" Then the man shot him and his two friends. Think about that. Put yourself in Schwerner's shoes. Imagine what it would have taken to summon such stillness, such profound and sincere compassion for one's killer, at the moment of death. And then put yourself in the shoes of that Klansman. After all, we know this story only because the Klansman later told it to investigators. He was haunted, for the rest of his life, by the depth of empathy that he confronted in that fateful instant. This story has stayed with me too, challenging me to admit it when in my comfortable everyday existence I fail to demonstrate even a fraction of that empathy and self-realization. But it's stayed with me in my civic identity as well. And it's made me wonder how much of our political and civic strife could be alleviated if we learned something from a young man who's been dead a half century but never gave in to fear or hate. Look around our country today. Look at the New York policemen who feel so insulted that they think they must turn their backs on their mayor. Look at the African-American citizens of that city who feel that the NYPD has never shown them the respect those disgruntled officers now demand. Look at the online comment threads after Ferguson and Staten Island. Look at how black men in hoodies and white men with badges are demonized. Look at the escalation of outrage that leads to philosophical hashtag wars about whether #BlackLivesMatter or #AllLivesMatter. Look at the disgust that drips from the lips of Democrats as they brace for a reactionary GOP Congress and from Republicans as they decry imperious Democrats. Errol Louis: There are two sides to America's policing issues . Look now at the people in your own community. Look at the way we walk past people whose circumstances are radically different from our own. Perhaps they are richer or poorer than you, or more liberal or less, or more self-destructive or less. Look at the way we ascribe moral meaning to those differences. Look at the way we tell ourselves stories about what our selves are. Look at the way those stories always accuse others of faults and excuse us for our own. Look at the way those solipsistic habits, which start with those closest to us, radiate outward. I have been guilty of this kind of self-justification, both personal and political. So have you. And for all of us, this season is an occasion to ask what it would take to earn the right to say these words: . I know just how you feel. To some people, this kind of radical compassion and loving nonviolence seems dangerously squishy, a slide down the slope to moral relativism. They fear that understanding the heart of another person, particularly the enemy, will lead to an obliteration of distinctions between self and other, between right and wrong. But that's not how it was for Michael Schwerner and for the other Freedom Riders. They had a crystal-clear understanding of the moral differences between them and the last-stand defenders of Jim Crow, between good and evil. Their capacity for empathy empowered them -- not to subdue others but to invite them into goodness and thereby transform them. This power does not come easily. It takes a lot to say truly, in the heat of conflict, that you know how your adversary feels. And to say nothing more -- no letting him off the hook, no further demonstrations of your goodness. Frankly, few of us will ever attain the near-saintly disciplined open-heartedness of young Schwerner. But more of us can come closer. And when few of us even bother trying, we get the political culture of today: polarization for its own sake; politics as a game of annihilation rather than repeat play; citizens as bloodthirsty spectators. As we begin the new year, as conflicts over race and class and guns and belonging continue to rage across the land, let's resolve to learn just how someone feels. And to let that knowledge guide our lives as citizens. ​ .","Eric Liu recalls words of civil rights worker before he was shot by KKK gunman .

"The United States and North Korea have long found themselves locked in a bitter cycle of escalating and deescalating tensions but the current cyber conflict may be especially hard to predict. CNN's Wilfred Chan discussed this with Mike Chinoy, a longtime North Korea expert who has traveled to the country 17 times, Senior Fellow at the U.S.-China Institute at the University of Southern California, and CNN's former Senior Asia Correspondent, whose new book ""The Last POW"" tells the story of the detention in North Korea of 85-year-old American tourist Merril Newman. There were reports Tuesday that North Korea's Internet was down, the disruption coming amid a growing war of words between the United States and North Korea over a cyberattack on Sony Pictures. Do you think the United States disabled North Korea's Internet in retaliation for the Sony hack? Chinoy: I'm not convinced that the U.S. government was behind the outage of the North Korean Internet. The issue though is not whether it was or it wasn't, the issue is what the North Koreans think it was. And I think it's safe to assume, unless they themselves took their system offline for their own security -- which is not impossible -- they'll be looking to respond. And if the U.S. government actually took down North Korea's Internet, that has its own implications. Because if the United States is officially engaging in cyberattacks then it implies North Korea can do it to us, and everybody else can do it to everybody else. How does the Sony hacking saga complicate the situation between the United States and North Korea? It's a brave new world. We now have a situation where it's entirely possible you've got third-party hackers possibly helping the North Koreans in the original Sony hack, entirely possibly taking down the North Korean Internet, who are beyond the control of any government. And that makes it much, much harder to assess. Part of what makes this dangerous is there are no agreed rules of the road in terms of cyber warfare in the way there are existing broad rules of the road for other security issues -- even if they are frequently violated. We're absolutely in uncharted territory. And we're in uncharted territory with pundits and the political class outraged in the United States, and a new, unknown North Korean leader in a system that we don't understand the dynamics of very well. So that's a worrisome combination. Do you think North Korea hacked Sony? I don't think the President of the United States would've been given talking points that so explicitly blamed North Korea if the U.S. government didn't have very high confidence there was a North Korean connection. Now, whether or not the North Koreans explicitly gave the order and then farmed it out to teams of people in China or elsewhere, we don't know enough about the decision-making process. How sophisticated are North Korea's hacking capabilities? We know they have a robust cyber capability. The North Koreans have devoted a lot of resources to giving themselves a lot of cyber capabilities. Their broader security strategy has changed under Kim Jong Un -- there's a heavy focus on nuclear, cyber, and asymmetrical warfare capabilities, which enables them to reduce expenditures on a conventional military. North Korea is the weaker, smaller power, and asymmetrical warfare is the approach of choice. The North Koreans are not suicidal. If they were responsible for the Sony attack, they targeted a specific company for a specific reason. It's hard for me to imagine they're going to take out the U.S. power grid. How do the United States and North Korea view each other right now? There's layers and layers of hostility and mistrust. Ever since the Korean War, the United States has seen North Korea as this dangerous, threatening country and there's always been concern when the North Koreans do something aggressive. In North Korea, based on my 17 visits there, what comes through clearly is the reverse image. They feel under siege from the United States. They are convinced that the American goal is to do them in, to bring them down. They feel alone and beleaguered and they're determined to keep their system afloat at all costs. The North Korean strategy has always been brinksmanship -- tit for tat, you hit me, we hit back harder. Part of their playbook is to make people think they are more extreme, they are crazier. A lot of it is rhetoric -- one of the challenges in situations like this is how to judge rhetoric. So when they threaten to attack the White House and so on, you have to be careful not to take it literally. Could this hacking crisis continue to escalate? Look, in 1976, North Korean soldiers crossed the demarcation line at Panmunjon, killed two Americans with axes, and we didn't go to war. In 2010, the North Koreans sank a South Korean ship, killing dozens of South Korean sailors, we didn't go to war. In 2010 when they shelled Yeonpyong island and killed South Koreans, we didn't go to war. We're going to go to war because they hacked a movie production company? I mean, you know, let's have a little bit of perspective about it. That being said, this has created a kind of perfect storm of a real threat with cyberattacks, with implications in terms of what else might happen. There's tremendous political pressure on the Obama administration to do something, even though the toolkit is somewhat limited. And what's new here is this is the biggest crisis since North Korea's youthful leader Kim Jong Un came to power three years ago. How could this play out in the long run? One of the likely responses is going to be accelerated moves toward a North Korean nuclear test. Lost in all the day to day headlines about Sony is the bigger strategic security picture which is the North Koreans are moving full speed ahead to enhance their nuclear capability. They've got a plutonium program, they've got a uranium program. Each time they do a nuclear test they move further toward having the capability to miniaturize a warhead. Once they can miniaturize a warhead they've definitely got medium range missiles. They've tested a long range missile, though it's not clear how well it works. There is nothing happening to constrain that. What worries me is there hasn't even been an attempt in the last couple of years to talk about this. Without a diplomatic agreement for them to curtail or roll back their nuclear program, they will soon have in a period of time, it's hard to judge how long, a larger nuclear arsenal, the ability to miniaturize a warhead, and a delivery system that can reach the continental United States. Then it gets really scary. Short of going to war and taking down the North Korean regime, it's very hard to see how you reverse that, unless you get back into some kind of negotiating process, and that seems very unlikely. There's a big debate still over whether we should talk to them. My sense is the North Koreans still would very much like to talk to the United States. But the Obama administration has not been in the mood to do it. Obama has just done this major initiative with Cuba, he's been talking to Iran, but in security terms the North Koreans are scarier. Unlike Iran, North Korea's got the bomb and Pyongyang uses overheated rhetoric which makes the Iranians sound moderate in comparison. There's very little evidence that sanctions work in terms of changing North Korea's behavior to what the United States wants. So that just makes the whole thing more dangerous.

"U.S. investigators have evidence that hackers stole the computer credentials of a system administrator to get access to Sony's computer system, allowing them broad access, U.S. officials briefed on the investigation tell CNN. The finding is one reason why U.S. investigators do not believe the attack on Sony was aided by someone on the inside, the officials tell CNN. The revelation is part of what is behind the government's conclusion that hackers operating on behalf of North Korea were responsible. The government is expected to publicly blame the reclusive regime as early as Friday. The hackers ability to gain access to the passwords of a top-level information technology employee allowed them to have ""keys to the entire building,"" one official said. Washington outraged over Sony decision . The access has led to some suspicion of perhaps an inside job. It's a common tactic that hackers use, and cyber-attacks often look like inside jobs, the officials say. U.S. used signal intelligence and other means to trace the attack to North Korea, finding digital footprints that pointed to North Korea.â€‹ The statement to be issued as early as Friday morning will provide some of the evidence behind the U.S. government's conclusion, but not all. Though officials say they are planning to lay blame on Friday, they haven't yet decided how to respond to the attack. The White House and other agencies are holding a series of high-level meetings to discuss the United States' range of options, a senior official in President Barack Obama's administration said. ""We do think it's appropriate to respond,"" the official said. Those options could include new sanctions against North Korea, another source said. White House press secretary Josh Earnest wouldn't confirm that the Obama administration has pinned the hack on North Korea, saying it's still being investigated by the FBI and the Justice Department. He said the investigation is ""being treated as a serious national security matter."" ""There is evidence to indicate that we have seen destructive activity with malicious intent that was initiated by a sophisticated actor,"" Earnest said. He said the United States' response would need to be ""proportional,"" and that national security officials considering how to respond are ""also mindful of the fact that sophisticated actors when they carry out actions like this are oftentimes, not always, but often seeking to provoke a response from the United States."" Opinion: Hollywood's complete moral surrender . A senior administration official said the White House did not pressure Sony to make the decision it announced Wednesday to pull the movie ""The Interview"" -- which depicts the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un -- from theaters. ""There was no pressure. Absolutely not,"" the official said, adding that consultations with Sony happened primarily in phone calls between the company and the FBI which were relayed to the White House. For all the restrictions the United States has already placed on North Korea, administration officials say there's a lot further those penalties could go. The toughest option: The United States could restrict North Korea's dollar-denominated trade by hitting Chinese banks that do business with Pyongyang -- a tactic used against Iran and, less comprehensively, against Russia after its incursion into Ukraine's Crimea region. Other economic sanctions could also be considered, and the United States could finger North Korean individuals involved in the hack for criminal charges -- though that option, while still being considered, appears unlikely, an administration official said. ""At this point we are not prepared to official say who we believe was behind this attack,"" Homeland Security Jeh Johnson told MSNBC on Thursday. ""I will say this: We do regard the attack on Sony as very serious."" Defector: North Korea deep into cyber warfare . Johnson described it as a ""serious attack not only on individuals and a company but basic freedoms we enjoy in this country,"" but did not want to label it terrorism. The administration is still discussing how to characterize the hack, sources said. Sources say it's unlikely there will be an indictment right now, as was the case in the Chinese military hacking case early this year. One law enforcement source said ""in order to indict you have to have an idea of who the players are,"" and at this point the investigation hasn't yet revealed those details. The law enforcement source said the United States' cyber investigation is moving at a speed that's unheard of amid mounting pressure for the U.S. government to publicly point the finger at North Korea. Analyst: We underestimated North Korea . The source said the Sony hack was similar to a cyber attack against South Korean banks last year, and that the coding was in Korean. A source familiar with the investigation says ""the tactics, techniques and procedures were right out of the North Korean playbook."" Sources with first-hand knowledge of the investigation said officials haven't ruled out the possibility that a Sony insider or former employee aided in the attack.","U.S. government officials are preparing to name North Korea as the culprit behind the Sony hack .

"(CNN) -- Veteran Spanish striker Raul has completed his move to German club Schalke after ending his record-breaking stay at Real Madrid. The 33-year-old agreed a deal until mid-2012 with the Bundesliga runners-up, joining on a free transfer after a trophy-laden 15 seasons at the Santiago Bernabeu. He had hinted on Monday that he might join an English club, having been linked with Tottenham among others. ""It's great news for FC Schalke 04,"" coach Felix Magath told the club's website on Wednesday. ""I'm delighted we've been able to inspire such an exceptional footballer and world-class striker to move to the Bundesliga and Schalke. ""Raul's qualities will help us move forward. His signing marks a decisive step in our efforts to strengthen and restructure our squad for the tasks ahead, and I look forward to working with such a likeable pro."" Raul bids farewell to Real . Raul is Real's all-time top scorer with 323 goals in 741 competitive appearances, having won three Champions League titles and six Spanish league crowns after coming through the club's youth ranks. He is also Spain's record goalscorer with 44 from 102 appearances, though his last outing came in 2006 before his country's breakthrough triumphs at Euro 2008 and the 2010 World Cup. The player, whose full name is Raul Gonzalez Blanco, has yet to receive a red card since making his first-team debut for Real in October 1994. Guti ends 24-year Real Madrid career . He is the third member of Real's squad to be released since Jose Mourinho took over as coach, with veteran midfielder Guti having joined Turkish club Besiktas and young defender Marcos Alonso sold to English side Bolton. Meanwhile, former England defender Sol Campbell has joined newly-promoted English Premier League side Newcastle on a one-year contract following the expiry of his short-term deal at Arsenal. The 35-year-old's new wife is also from the North-East area, where Campbell will be reunited with manager Chris Hughton -- who worked with him as a youth coach when both were at Tottenham. Arsenal's Denmark striker Nicklas Bendtner will miss the start of the new season due to a groin problem that troubled him at the World Cup. The 22-year-old had surgery on the injury last November, but it has not been successful.","Raul has completed his move to German club Schalke after leaving Real Madrid .

"(CNN)Imagine boarding your next flight and having the entire cabin to yourself. In this age of overstuffed planes, where we squeeze our bodies into cramped seats and jockey for overhead bin space, it sounds like a dream -- one that would never happen. But it did -- sort of -- on Monday for a man who boarded a long-delayed Delta Airlines flight from Cleveland to New York to find that all his fellow passengers had been rebooked on other flights. The man, Chris O'Leary of New York City, did what most of us would probably do. He chose an aisle seat near the front of the plane and stretched out. He chuckled at the absurdity of his situation. And he got a flight attendant to snap pictures of him, with rows of empty seats in the background. Then he began tweeting. ""They rebooked everyone but me on another flight to LGA, so I am literally the only person on this plane,"" he posted. ""No, I'm not joking,"" he tweeted a few minutes later. ""I'm the only one on this plane."" The rare situation was caused by bad weather, which caused several flight delays in the Northeast. O'Leary's Flight 6259, which normally seats 76 people, was delayed for six hours, and somehow he missed out on being rebooked. Often, an airline will cancel a near-empty flight. But Delta Airlines told KABC, a CNN affliliate, that it needed to get O'Leary's plane to New York's La Guardia Airport for flights later in the day. The most annoying types of airline passengers . As it turned out, O'Leary was not the only passenger on the flight. The plane was about to push back when, at the last minute, another man hopped on. The two didn't keep each other company, however. O'Leary told ABC News the other guy reclined his seat and slept most of the way. Even so O'Leary, a media strategist and editor of a beer-lovers' website, won't forget his semi-private jet ride anytime soon. ""It was definitely the most memorable flight I've been on in recent memory if only for the sheer lack of passengers to become bothersome,"" he told ABC News. ""There were no screaming babies, no one listening to loud lyrics or reclining their seats or taking off their shoes."" How bad was 2014 for air travel?","Chris O'Leary was only passenger on a Cleveland-New York flight until the last minute .

"(CNN)The New York City clinic where Joan Rivers underwent a procedure before her death will no longer be eligible to receive funds for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries at the end of this month.

The Yorkville Endoscopy Center says it plans to appeal. ""We are continuing to work with all regulatory bodies. We intend to communicate with CMS and appropriate authorities to have the decision reversed.

"A man armed with what police say was an assault rifle and carrying materials expressing anti-government sentiment opened fire Friday morning at Los Angeles International Airport, killing one person before being chased down himself, authorities said. Eyewitnesses said the suspect asked people, ""Hey, are you TSA?"" -- the acronym for the Transportation Security Administration -- according to a federal law enforcement official. If they said ""no,"" he would move on. One of those questioned travelers was Leon Saryan. He told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the same man he'd just seen shoot a TSA officer ""calmly"" walked toward him and asked, ""TSA?"" ""I just shook my head,"" Saryan said. ""And he kept going."" In the aftermath of the shooting, investigators found information on the suspect expressing not just anti-federal government sentiment but also anger at the TSA specifically, according to the federal law enforcement official. By then, a TSA officer was dead -- the first employee of that relatively new agency to be killed in the line of duty. The agency identified him as Gerardo Hernandez, who would have turned 40 next week. He was working as a travel document checker at the time of the shooting, according to TSA workers' union and federal sources. Two additional TSA officers were also shot, one in the leg, authorities said. The suspected gunman himself was detained after being shot in the chest multiple times, according to an intelligence source briefed by Los Angeles police. As of Friday evening, he was receiving medical attention at a hospital, according to FBI Special Agent in Charge David Bowdich. He was identified later by the FBI as Paul Anthony Ciancia, a 23-year-old from Los Angeles. He graduated in 2008 from Salesianum School, an all-boys Catholic school in Wilmington, Delaware, according to school President Brendan P. Kennealey. The intelligence source said Ciancia's family became concerned in recent days after he sent his brother and father ""angry, rambling"" texts venting about the government, living in Los Angeles and his unhappiness generally. Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center said that it received three male victims -- one in critical condition and two in fair condition. One of the two in fair condition suffered gunshot wounds, while another had an unspecified injury, said Dr. Lynne McCullough, an emergency physician at the Los Angeles hospital. One of them was released by Friday afternoon; one of the others who remained at the hospital was Ciancia, according to the intelligence source. Two patients, meanwhile, were transported to Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in Torrance, said David Klurad, a trauma surgeon there. One was what Klurad described as a ""middle-aged"" person with minor injuries from being shot in the shoulder. The other had no signs of life when he arrived at the hospital, the surgeon added. It wasn't known if this person was the slain TSA officer. TSA: Number of guns discovered in airports rising . The episode caused what airport police Chief Patrick Gannon, who had said the shooter used an ""assault rifle,"" described as a ""large amount of chaos."" People ran for their lives and took shelter wherever they could as authorities pursued the gunman. Chuck Ocheret was among those in the busy airport when he heard two ""loud pops."" ""Then I heard this mad rush of people, and there was a stampede of people coming from this direction,"" Ocheret told CNN. ""Nobody really knew what was going on."" Still, by Friday afternoon, authorities believes the worst was over. Gannon noted it is believed there was only one shooter. Suspect 'pulled an assault rifle out ... and began to open fire' An otherwise normal day in the airport's Terminal 3 turned upside down around 9:20 a.m. (12:20 p.m. ET), as the suspect approached a checkpoint. There, he ""pulled an assault rifle out of a bag and began to open fire,"" Gannon said. Passenger Saryan had just cleared the TSA checkpoint and was reaching for his shoes and belt when shots rang out, prompting ""everybody (to) hit the ground and .. run."" A TSA officer grabbed Saryan's shoes and started running alongside him, before the gunman grazed the officer with a bullet. ""I went and cowered in a corner,"" Saryan said. The suspect kept moving down Terminal 3, equipped with three magazines for his weapon,  according to the intelligence source briefed by Los Angeles police, he began running down Terminal 3. He had company. Gannon said two officers from his department responded ""within seconds after the shooting started"" and ran off in pursuit of the suspect. Opinion: Arming TSA officers not the answer . Traveler Vernon Cardenas was sitting at one end of the terminal, when he heard noise and saw a mass of people running toward him. He and others bolted through a kicked-open exit door and ran onto the tarmac -- believing then it was safer there -- even with then still-arriving and departing jetliners -- than in the terminal above. The circular area where Cardenas had been is where the bloodshed finally ended with the gunman's shooting by law enforcement, according to the intelligence source. They didn't take any chances with the wounded suspect either, handcuffing him to a gurney as he was being carried out. Actor Tim Daly said that when he was eventually led out of the  the Virgin America first-class lounge, he saw where the incident came to a head around Gates 35 and 36. After being told not to step on any blood or glass, Daly spotted a high-powered rifle on the ground along with a pair of black shoes and several bags strewn across the floor. Also there was more than 100 rounds of unspent ammunition, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said, enough to ""have literally killed everyone in that terminal today."" Los Angeles Police Chief Robert Beck credited the responding airport police officers with heroically saving lives with their efforts. It was a sentiment echoed by Mike Bonin, a city councilman whose district includes the airport and its surrounding neighborhoods. ""When shots rang out, members of the Los Angeles World Airport police department ran towards that gunfire, without regard to their own safety and well being,"" Bonin said. ""... No doubt, without their efforts, the casualty count today would be significantly higher."" Hundreds of flights impacted . Even once the suspect was shot and detained, law enforcement officers roamed the airport with guns drawn looking for others who might have involved. Fast Facts: 25 Deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history . KCAL showed live video of three officers with rifles to their shoulders inspecting parked cars in an open-air parking lot. At one point, firefighters lay tarps on the street at the airport, apparently for triage. The episode soon rendered one of the world's busiest airports a ghost town. Large portions were evacuated as authorities ordered a ""ground stop"" for arriving planes that lasted four hours. About 750 flights were affected by the ordeal, including 46 would-be arriving aircraft that were diverted to other nearby airports, said Gina Marie Lindsay, executive director of Los Angeles World Airports. Some that did touch down were held on the ground in Los Angeles, while others didn't leave their originating airports. LAX, as it's known, was a mess. Shooting delays flights nationwide . The area around the airport was jammed with cars as police shut down access. Meanwhile, many who were in the terminals, waiting for flights to arrive or depart, were pushed out. Even as late as 4 p.m. -- some 6½ hours after the shooting occurred -- masses were still huddled on sidewalks outside the airport, because they had no place else to go. Soon after that, people started moving back in as the airport operations kicked back into gear. Terminal 3, though, remained closed -- all flights that were supposed to go in and out of there were relocated elsewhere in the airport -- and will be ""for a while,"" said Bowdich of the FBI. ""This has been a trying day for everyone, I know,"" Lindsay said. That's especially true for members of the TSA, which lost one of its own Friday and had two others wounded. The federal agency's chief, John Pistole, is heading to Los Angeles on Saturday. Before he left, he sent a message to his employees thanking them for their good work and support for each other. ""Together, we will get through this,"" Pistole wrote. ""Our faith will guide us and our professionalism will ensure our ability to carry out our mission.""

"(CNN)New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's comments on vaccinations are already grabbing headlines, but the would-be 2016 contender has a busy schedule while overseas in London. On the trip — billed as trade mission — Christie also criticized President Barack Obama's negotiating skills, arguing that Obama has been weak in recent talks involving Iran and Cuba. ""You need an effective negotiator at the top and as I've said before, I think the President has shown over and over that he's not a good negotiator,"" Christie told reporters in Cambridge, England. ""If you see the reaction from Raul Castro, it doesn't seem like he's saying 'thank you, how can I make Cuba freer?' It seems he now wants Guantanamo Bay and it sounds to me like he now wants reparations and compensation,"" he continued, addressing Obama's push to ease the Cuba embargo. ""So the president is not proving himself to be the most adept negotiator in my mind on behalf of American interests."" Christie is in the United Kingdom for a three-day swing that will offer the governor -- who recently launched a political committee ahead of a potential White House run - -a chance to polish his foreign policy credentials. Later Monday he meets with Prime Minister David Cameron at 10 Downing Street, as well as U.S. Ambassador Matthew Barzun and members of the prime minister's Cabinet. Asked about vaccinations, Christie said he and his wife vaccinate their children but he understands ""that parents need to have some measure of choice as well. So that's a balance the government has to decide."" Christie, an avid sports fan, started his trip watching Arsenal defeat Aston Villa, 5-0, in a Premiere League game. He also stayed up late to watch the Super Bowl game, he told reporters Monday morning. Christie ventured across the pond a couple of days after Mitt Romney announced he wouldn't pursue the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, a decision that opens up funding streams for Christie. The two, who've long described themselves as friends, had dinner Friday night. Asked about the dinner, Christie, according to the Associated Press, told reporters Sunday: ""Good to see you all."" The governor declined to comment further on how Romney's decision affects Christie's chances for 2016. ""I just arrived here a few hours ago,"" he said. ""I'm not processing a lot at the moment. I've processed some soccer. That was about it. Or football as they call it."" His schedule on Monday included a wreath laying ceremony at the Cambridge American Cemetery to honor U.S. military service members who died in World War II. The itinerary this week also includes a visit to Hope House, a drug addiction treatment facility that's backed by members of the royal family. Britain's Prince Harry teamed up with Christie in 2013 to tour recovery efforts after Superstorm Sandy severely damaged the Jersey Shore. Unlike his trip to Mexico in September and to Canada in December, Christie is not set to deliver any major foreign policy speeches. Instead he'll hold roundtable discussions and tour facilities that focus on the life sciences industry, including pharmaceutical and health care organizations.

"Washington (CNN)As accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev goes on trial Monday few doubt the outcome of the first phase of the two-phase trial. It's the second, the sentencing phase, including a possible death sentence, that has been the subject of behind the scenes discussions. Federal prosecutors and defense attorneys for Tsarnaev have held talks on a possible plea agreement but failed to reach one, U.S. officials familiar with the talks say. The discussions in recent months have centered on the possibility of Tsarnaev pleading guilty and receiving a life sentence without parole, according to the officials. 13 things you should know about the trial . But the talks have reached an impasse because the Justice Department has resisted removing the death penalty as a possibility, these officials say. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney in Boston declined to comment. Attorney Judy Clarke, who represents Tsarnaev, didn't respond to a request for comment. The outcome so far is unusual for Clarke who helped negotiate plea deals that saved the lives of notorious criminals including 9/11 plotter Zacarias Moussaoui, Unabomber Ted Kaczynski and Jared Loughner, who carried out the mass shooting that killed six and gravely injured former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. RELATED: A tale of two Tsarnaevs on eve of trial in Boston Marathon bombing . Jury selection is set to begin Monday in the case, with Tsarnaev facing 30 counts including detonating a weapon of mass destruction. Three people died and 264 people were injured in the April 15 attacks. Attorney General Eric Holder is a critic of the death penalty, but he authorized seeking capital punishment in this case saying Tsarnaev acted in ""an especially heinous, cruel and depraved manner."" He also cited a seeming lack of remorse. Tsnarnaev's brother Tamerlan was killed in a confrontation with police during the manhunt that followed the bombing. Among the evidence prosecutors are expected to use against him are statements claiming to be angry at U.S. wars that killed Muslims in Afghanistan and Iraq. There are several reasons to pursue a plea deal, including to spare survivors and victim families from having to relive the trauma of the bombings, and to save financial costs in a case that has already cost millions of dollars. The case's toll on victim families has been at issue in the case. Prosecutors tried to bar Tsarnaev from being able to view autopsy photos of victims, claiming it would cause new suffering to their survivors. A judge rejected that request. Boston US Attorney Carmen Ortiz has overseen the plea discussions. Any decision to remove the death penalty as a possibility would have approval from Holder. The attorney general Friday also authorized prosecutors to seek the death penalty against the man accused of shooting a TSA employee at Los Angeles Airport in 2013.

Yeah, Anushay, feminists might be cool, but you might not realize they can also project evil on unsuspecting victims. After all, don't they play a role in the pedophilia of some priests? Or what a new movement terms the ""Emangelization"" of the Catholic Church. Thank goodness the Washington Post's Terrance McCoy exposed Cardinal Raymond Leo Burke's ""manifesto."" The good Cardinal told a website called the New Emangelization that he believes the ""radical feminist movement"" of the 1960s and '70s drove the ""manly priests"" from the altar. ""There was a period of time when men who were feminized and confused about their own sexual identity had entered the priesthood; sadly some of these disordered men sexually abused minors; a terrible tragedy for which the Church mourns.""

"(CNN)On a night that's all about flash and high-octane excitement, the commercial stood out for its starkness, both in tone and topic. On Super Bowl Sunday, No More, an anti-domestic violence campaign, teamed up with the NFL's ad group for a haunting 60-second reminder of the barriers to even talking about violence in the home. The commercial features the audio of a 911 call, inspired by a real-life call a dispatcher posted on Reddit, the social networking site, last year. In response to a question posed on the popular forum about what calls 911 operators could never shake, one wrote: ""I had a call that started out pretty dumb, but was actually pretty serious."" It seemed to be dumb because the caller didn't tell of an emergency when asked. As posted on Reddit, the call went: . Caller: ""I'd like to order a pizza for delivery."" Dispatcher: ""Ma'am, you've reached 911"" Caller: ""Yeah, I know. Can I have a large with half pepperoni, half mushroom and peppers?"" Dispatcher: ""Ummm ... I'm sorry, you know you've called 911 right?"" Caller: ""Yeah, do you know how long it will be?"" Dispatcher: ""OK, ma'am, is everything OK over there? Do you have an emergency?"" Caller: ""Yes, I do."" The emergency is that she was being physically abused but couldn't break away from her attacker to call for help. The dispatcher, who has been identified as Keith Weisinger, eventually caught on. Dispatcher: And you can't talk about it because there's someone in the room with you? Caller: Yes, that's correct. Do you know how long it will be? Dispatcher: I have an officer about a mile from your location. Are there any weapons in your house? Caller: Nope. Dispatcher: Can you stay on the phone with me? Caller: Nope. See you soon, thanks. Reading the words is haunting enough, and heard in the Super Bowl spot, they're chillingly effective. The audio plays over images of a home that looks unremarkable, apart for a few telltale signs of disarray. And how did the Reddit post make it to the small screen's biggest night? According to The Wall Street Journal, a writer saw the post, reached out to Weisinger and got another dispatcher from Connecticut to read a nearly identical version of the call Weisinger recounted.

"Princeton pulled ahead of Harvard to claim first place in the ""best national universities"" category in U.S. News & World Report's annual ranking of nearly 1,800 schools. Williams College again claimed sole possession of the top spot in the Best National Liberal Arts Colleges category. This year's methodology put more emphasis on student outcomes and less on where students ranked in their high school classes. Also this year, the difference between predicted and actual graduation rates was applied for the first time to Regional Universities and Regional Colleges. The magazine increased the weight given to graduation and retention rates in the National Universities and National Liberal Arts Colleges categories, meaning that outcome-related measures were the most heavily weighted factors. When cost was weighed, Williams -- at an average of $19,251 per year after grants based on need were factored in -- fell to No. 3, behind Barnard (rated second at $12,282 per year after grants) and Amherst (rated first at $16,286 after grants). Best-value regional universities were identified as Gallaudet, Carey, Creighton and Trinity. Cited as best-value regional colleges were Cooper Union, John Brown University, College of the Ozarks and California Maritime Academy. Clark Atlanta University won a dubious distinction among national universities. In all, 93% of its graduating students were in debt -- with an average of $43,727, according to U.S. News. That average does not factor in the 7% who had no debt. In the category of least debt, Princeton once again earned roaring rights, with just 24% of students in debt, and an average among them of $5,096.

"(CNN)A smuggler's drone flying from Mexico crash-landed just south of the U.S. border city of San Ysidro, California, in a failed drug delivery this week, Tijuana Municipal Police said. The incident showed that smugglers aren't just going underground anymore -- using tunnels beneath the U.S.-Mexico border to transport drugs and migrants. Now, the smugglers are trying to do business using unmanned aerial vehicles. U.S. authorities acknowledge a new smuggling strategy may be emerging on the border. ""To date, U.S. Customs and Border Protection has not intercepted any drones smuggling narcotics across the borders into the United States,"" said Alberto Vallina, supervisory Border Patrol agent in San Diego. ""In collaboration with our federal, state, local and international law enforcement partners, CBP remains vigilant against emerging trends and ever-changing tactics employed by transnational criminal organizations behind illegal attempts to smuggle narcotics into the U.S."" The drone was loaded with more than six pounds of the synthetic drug crystal meth, Tijuana police said. The drone crashed Tuesday night in a supermarket parking lot in Tijuana. Apparently the smugglers became too greedy, Mexican authorities said. The silver and black, six-propeller Spreading Wings S900 model was not able to withstand the weight of the load, police said. ""In San Diego, the street value, at last account, for a six-pound load would be about $48,000,"" DEA Special Agent Matt Barden said. ""Once you get it across the border, that stuff's like gold."" This wasn't the first time a drone was used in a smuggling attempt from Mexico, according to drug war analysts, U.S. officials and local Mexican police. But the incident amplified concerns about border security and officers' safety. ""I would hate to belittle 6 pounds of meth,"" Barden said. ""That's like saying 6 pounds of heroin isn't bad ... but I think the big thing to look at is the fact that the cartels or drug traffickers from Mexico are using drones in their playbook. ""My greater fear, being an agent, is what a drone means to officer safety. That to me, personally, being a tactical officer, that's my concern,"" he said. Drones are emerging as the latest technological gadget used by cartels and smugglers in trying to outfox border authorities. The crashed drone was a prototype that used a global positioning system, or GPS, to send it to a particular destination, Tijuana police said on the department's Facebook page. ""The cartels have been using drones for surveillance. Transporting drugs is a bit more complicated,"" said Sylvia Longmire, a leading drug war analyst. ""This is further evidence that the cartels have unlimited funds and creativity."" As to why smugglers would attempt to transfer what in the grand scheme is ""not that much,"" both Longmire and Barden were in agreement. ""My guess ... it might be a personal load,"" Longmire said. ""When you look at cartels, their goal is to flood the U.S. with as much drugs as they possibly can,"" Barden said. ""It also could have been a test run for something bigger."" CNN's Devon Sayers contributed to this report .","U.S. remains ""vigilant against emerging trends and ever-changing tactics"" by smugglers .

"After more than a week of stalemate, student leaders and the government have agreed to a framework for formal talks after protesters around the government headquarters gave civil servants better access to the building. Talks are scheduled between the government and protest leaders at 4 p.m. local time Friday (4 a.m. Friday ET), and media coverage will be allowed. The government's number two official, Chief Secretary Carrie Lam, will be the principal negotiator from the government side. Embattled Chief Executive C.Y. Leung released a video statement saying students should consider the inconveniences to the general public and insisted the students clear the vehicle entrances to the government complex. He also advised students to leave the protest site in Mong Kok. The news of official talks comes as a dwindling number of pro-democracy demonstrators continue to cling on to their protest sites in key areas of the tightly packed city. As their numbers wane, so does patience of some of their fellow citizens. ""At first, I supported them, but then I started to think they are being selfish because they block the roads -- and that's wrong,"" said Virginia Lai, who has sold newspapers from a stall in the busy district of Mong Kok for 45 years. Lai says her business is down 30% and getting worse. The student-led demonstrators are camped out at a major intersection in the neighborhood, which witnessed violent clashes between protesters and their opponents over the weekend. A CNN team at the main protest point in the Admiralty area also witnessed friction Tuesday night as a handful of protesters wearing blue ribbons -- indicating an anti-Occupy stance -- were mobbed by hundreds of Occupy student protesters. The protesters have blocked several main highways in the city for more than a week as they seek to change a decision by China's ruling Communist Party on how the next election for Hong Kong's top leader will work. At their peak, the demonstrations brought tens of thousands of Hong Kong residents together in spectacular fashion, covering large areas of the semiautonomous territory's central business district in a sea of people. 'Disrupting my life' But that was last week, when two back-to-back public holidays put work and classes on hold for a lot of people. As activity has cranked back up in the financial and commercial hub in recent days, crowds at the protest sites have thinned significantly and signs of discontent among other residents have spread. ""I am very angry because this movement is disrupting my life,"" said Polly Lau, an elderly woman who has lived in Mong Kok all her life. ""I think there will be a rebellion actually, a rebellion of the other 7 million people in Hong Kong against them."" The protests have blocked bus and tram routes, worsening traffic and putting more strain on the city's rail network. Some businesses, offices and schools have closed temporarily. In Tuesday's altercation in Admiralty, a known pro-Beijing activist, Lee See Yin, attempted to address crowds from street level through a megaphone and was surrounded by an angry crowd of hundreds of student protesters who began screaming to drown her out. She insisted that she was also from Hong Kong and had a right to be heard, asking the crowds, ""Is this real democracy?"" The altercation, which involved verbal assault but no apparent physical abuse, lasted 10 to 15 minutes. Eventually, half a dozen police came over and formed a ring around the handful of anti-Occupy protesters, who then left the area escorted by the officers. On Sunday, a group of about 30 taxi drivers carried out their own protest to express their frustration with the pro-democracy sit-ins, which they said were affecting their livelihoods, according to local broadcaster RTHK. But the protest movement also commands a lot of sympathy among residents of the city, especially after police used tear gas and pepper spray in a failed effort to disperse demonstrators on September 28 -- tactics seen by many as overly harsh. Is it safe to travel to Hong Kong? Is it 'deal time'? Some commentators are arguing that now is a good moment for demonstrators to cash in their chips before they lose too much support. ""The longer this drags on, the more student activists risk looking to average Hongkongers like irritants,"" wrote William Pesek, an Asia-Pacific columnist for Bloomberg View, suggesting it's now ""deal time for Hong Kong's students."" ""Why not parlay what's been achieved so far into meaningful concessions from the government?"" Pesek said. His suggestion follows calls from some prominent figures, including the heads of local universities, for students to leave the protest sites for their own safety. Other observers have noted that the demonstrators have succeeded in putting the democracy issue back on the agenda. But it remains uncertain what kind of deal the protesters might be able to reach with the government. One of the movement's demands has been the resignation of Hong Kong's top leader, Chief Executive C.Y. Leung. Increasing fatigue . Some demonstrators have said they are running out of steam after enduring long days and nights camped out on the asphalt amid stifling heat and torrential downpours. ""I'm tired, but I think we have to stay a while longer,"" said Kristine Wu, a student who has been at the main protest site on Hong Kong Island for a week. Are you there? Share images, if you can safely . 'We really have to stand strong' Other protesters among the depleted crowd still holding firm at the site Tuesday expressed similar determination to stay put until some kind of result was achieved. ""We really have to stand strong,"" said Luk Kam Yan, a student who had been protesting for eight days. ""There's been a lot of rumors about clearing out, but I feel if we stay here, we still have a bit of bargaining power."" Student leaders have said they will continue the protest until they have productive talks with the government and expressed optimism that their supporters will stick with them. ""Many protesters need rest after nine days of occupation,"" Lester Shum, the deputy secretary general of the Hong Kong Federation of Students, said Monday. ""I don't believe they are already giving up. When they have recovered, they will return."" But the government appears content to watch the demonstrators' numbers dwindle as negotiations drag on.","Student protest leaders and Hong Kong's chief secretary will meet Friday, official says .

"Washington (CNN)Just over a month after the release of American aid worker Alan Gross from a Cuban prison ushered in a new era between Washington and Havana, the relationship is facing a new chill. Speaking at a summit of Latin American and Caribbean leaders Wednesday, Cuban President Raul Castro made some big demands of the United States. Among them, Castro asked for the return of the Guantanamo Naval Base to Cuba, an end to the five decades-old trade embargo, a ceasing of U.S.-run television and radio broadcasts on the island, and compensation for economic damages. ""The economic, commercial and financial blockade that provokes enormous human and economic damage is a violation of international law that ought to be overturned,"" Castro said. The White House Thursday dismissed Castro's demands. When asked whether the U.S. would actually return the Guantanamo base to Cuba, Press Secretary Josh Earnest responded with an abrupt ""No."" ""The naval base is not something that we believe should be closed,"" he said, adding that the U.S. would keep the base even after the prison has been emptied. The comments were somewhat of a reality check for an administration attempting to navigate a relationship weighed down by decades of mistrust. It may take more time than originally expected. ""What (Castro's) comments highlight is that there is a pretty clear difference between reestablishing diplomatic relations and carrying out the longer process of normalizing relations,"" Earnest said. But as the Cuba Study Group's Tomas Bilbao notes, Castro's audience has to be taken into consideration. ""This is a speech that Raul Castro was giving in front of the CELAC to several of his regional friends, Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador, people who may feel challenged by Cuba and the United States reengaging their relationship,"" Bilbao said. He added: ""The Cuban government has long benefited from a position of confrontation with the United States, and as President Obama's policies take away a lot of those excuses, I think we'll see the Castro government come up and rehash some of these talking points to be able to continue to feed that ever-diminishing credibility of that argument."" So as Castro feeds the beast, don't expect the United States to give in to Cuba's demands. ""We shouldn't be derailed by the fact that we're dealing with a difficult totalitarian government and if we allow the Cuban government to determine what steps we do or do not take, we're in essence putting our foreign policy in the hands of a totalitarian state,"" Bilbao said.","Cuban President Raul Castro is demanding the U.S. leave Guantanamo Bay .

"Hong Kong (CNN)A 32-year-old man was found dead in an Internet cafe in Taiwan after a marathon three-day gaming binge, the island's second death of an online gamer this year. The man, surnamed Hsieh, entered the cafe in Kaohsiung, Taiwan's second largest city, on January 6, Jennifer Wu, a police spokesperson from the Hunei district precint told CNN. An employee found him motionless and sprawled on a table at 10 a.m. on January 8 and he was rushed to hospital, where he was pronounced dead from cardiac failure, she added. ""He has been unemployed for a long time, and internet cafes were the only place he could go to,"" she said. ""His family said he would disappear for two to three days on end."" Police first released details of the case late last week. It is not known exactly how long the man lay dead in the Internet cafe but police said his corpse had begun to stiffen so he must have been dead for several hours before they arrived on the scene. Police said gamers in the café continued as if nothing happened even when the police and paramedics arrived. ""The CCTV footage from the Internet cafe showed that he had a small struggle before he collapsed motionless,"" said Wu. Cold temperatures and over-exhaustion from the long hours spent playing games likely contributed to Hsieh's cardiac arrest, a police statement said. According to the Taipei Times, the man was a ""regular customer"" who often played for consecutive days. ""When tired, he would sleep face down on the table or doze off slumped in his chair,"" the staff member was quoted as saying. ""That is why we were not aware of his condition in the beginning."" Taiwan is no stranger to deaths from marathon sessions of online gaming. Hsieh's death came after 38-year-old man was found dead at an Internet cafe in Taipei on January 1 after playing video games for five days straight. And in 2012, the corpse of man who died playing online games went unnoticed for 10 hours by other gamers and staff.","Gamer entered the Internet cafe on January 8, was found two days later .

"Jizan, Saudi Arabia (CNN)Driving out of the sleepy Saudi seaside town of Jizan at dawn, I had no idea what to expect. I'd been asking the Saudi Interior Ministry to take me there for several years. Now I was in the desert kingdom covering King Salman bin Abdulaziz's ascent to the throne, and that permission had finally come through. In the past few weeks, Houthi rebels have taken control of Yemen's capital, pushing the country ever closer to ""failed state"" status and giving the al Qaeda franchise there -- al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP -- a greater foothold. The Saudi minister of interior, now second-in-line to the throne, has a personal stake in seeing AQAP eradicated. The terror group's top bomb-maker put a sophisticated bomb in his own brother's rectum, exploding it when the brother met the leading royal a few years ago. The brother died, the minister was only lightly injured. This is the same bomb-maker who made the underpants bomb that came close to bringing down an airliner over Detroit on Christmas Day 2009. Despite extensive drone campaigns targeting him, he is believed to still be alive and remains a significant global threat. There is no doubt in anyone's mind here that al Qaeda in Yemen will use any chance it gets to export terror over the border to their northern neighbor, with the royal family being the targets of choice. Col. Omar al Kahtani, our escort for the day, was in a voluble mood as we sped toward the looming mountains that mark the border. ""Anything could happen,"" he told us. ""Be ready with your camera."" Gun battles are rare on this border, he said, but only three weeks earlier, on Saudi's northern frontier,  ISIS fighters broke through the defenses, killing three Saudi soldiers, including their commander. The gun battle, footage of which was posted on the Internet, was a salutary reminder that the desert kingdom, the West's biggest regional partner in fighting the terror groups, is surrounded by battle-hardened enemies. This corner of the country is remarkably green. Relatively lush vegetation -- in Saudi terms, at least --  sprouts in profusion from the semi-arid fields. As our four-wheel-drive truck swung through the rickety metal gate, marking the edge of the border exclusion zone, we got our first taste of what has mostly been a hidden war down here. A sprawling Saudi village of large ornate villas came into view. Pretty, until we got close, when we realized the buildings were all shot up. Rockets had torn gaping holes in the walls and gardens were overgrown with spindly tentacles of creepers that slowly consumed the once-vibrant homes. Our host explained this was a village overrun by Houthi rebels from Yemen six years ago. In a three-week battle, Saudi Apache gunships had nearly destroyed the hamlet in the battle to save it. The government moved the residents away, creating a buffer between them and their fractious neighbor. As we drive on, he tells us Yemen's security is worsening and Saudi Arabia is spending almost $3 billion on beefing up border security. Our trucks are bumping and slipping their way up the newly cut rough rock tracks. At moments, it feels as if we are almost climbing vertically. These mountains are as rugged and rough as they are beautiful. Villages cling precariously to their higher reaches. No fence reaches up this far, the tiny smattering of guards solidifies the impression that at these altitudes, border control works on an honor system. No line on a map will stop these mountain men from rounding up their stray goats. Even from the roadside I can see tiny footpaths crisscrossing the steep terrain from Yemen to Saudi and back. In the foothills, control is much more effective. Watch towers are equipped with thermal imaging equipment, super zoom cameras watching over mile upon mile, and layer upon layer of razor wire. It needs to be like this. What we saw was staggering. I had no idea so many people and such a massive amount of drugs are moving over the border every day. At our first stop, we saw two men captured that day. We saw another one caught soon after. Then a whole vanload, about a dozen people crowded inside a mesh cage welded to a pickup truck. One of them was just 11 years old. They all told us they had come to Saudi for work. The 11-year-old was earning about $100 a month on a supermarket till in Jizan. All told the same story: about poverty and increasing chaos in Yemen and the Houthis getting stronger. The risk of jail in Saudi, they said, was better than the certainty of poverty in Yemen. Our government escort told us they'd all be sent to the nearest large police station where they would be fingerprinted and officials would check their records to make sure none had ties to terrorism. The men -- and they were all men -- admitted that sneaking over the border is getting much harder amid the increase in guard posts and border fences. Border guards told us in the past three months alone, they have picked up 42,000 people along the 800-kilometer (about 500 miles) border. Of course we are unable to verify that figure, but if the volume of illegal migrants we saw in the morning was shocking, then the afternoon was mind-blowing. We were taken to a room where three children were standing with bundles of qat, the narcotic shrub that most Yemenis chew every day, at their feet. The youngest, a 10-year-old, told me drug barons pay him $50 for hauling 10-kilos (about 22 lbs) of the green leaves over the border. It's the second time he has been caught. I was told that the boy, who had been given a banana and a bottle of water by the guards, would be taken back to the border and told to return home. All three looked small for their age. No one, particularly them, doubted they would be back. Unemployment among younger people is running at 40% in Yemen, likely higher in their villages. Putting food on the table at the end of the day is as far ahead as they think. Between them, they had been caught with about 30 kilos of the narcotic. Piled up outside the guard post were several tons more -- the haul of the past week, or so we were told. I'd seen similar piles outside many of the other posts we'd already visited. According to statistics given to us at the Jizan headquarters of the border guards, qat is a multi-million-dollar business. In the last three months, they say, they have seized more than 500,000 tons along the border, with a street value close to $100 million. They also showed us 50 kg of cannabis resin they had confiscated that day. Over the past three months, more than 6,000 kg of hashish -- with a street value in Saudi of about $36 million -- had been seized, we were told. Guns and ammunition are also smuggled in: 2,562 weapons have been seized in the past three months, as well as 380,088 rounds of ammunition, the border guards said. And the list goes on. And so did our day and the near-continual stream of infiltrators. The problem for the Saudis is that they cannot ignore this deluge. Any one of the thousands they stop could be a terrorist. Said Kouachi, one of the Charlie Hebdo attackers in Paris, is believed to have slipped in to Yemen not far from Saudi's border, making his way there for terror training from Oman. The attack he and his brother carried out also shows the lengths that AQAP is willing to go to in order to export terror. Hajj pilgrimages to Islam's two holiest sites, Mecca and Medina, draw millions of Muslims to the kingdom. Knowing who comes and who goes is vital. As the sun began to set, we jumped in police gun trucks as another group of men were spotted near the razor wire border fence. Tearing over the bumpy ground, we raced to intercept them. Surprisingly, they didn't run. They know they'll be freed soon, and from what we saw none of the six were beaten or abused. Within minutes, as we were driving away, the sun sinking over the horizon and our day done, we thought we passed another eight men being caught. We stopped as police emptied the men's pockets. Cheap cellphones, not much else. They were illegal workers on their way back to homes in Yemen after weeks of work in Saudi, their wages already sent over the border by local money exchangers. It was already darkening as we pulled away, once again trying to set off back to Jizan. And yet again,  we stopped as we saw a group of guards searching two small figures. More child qat smugglers, rope and sack bags on their backs bulging with the big wraps that protect the delicate green leaves. Each boy carrying bundles with the drug baron's name on them. Later, when we finally did get back to Jizan, we ate dinner sitting on rugs next to the Red Sea: fish, meat, salads, bread and Saudi ""champagne,"" non-alcoholic fizzy grape juice. This is a land of plenty, Yemen is not. Stanching the human tide flowing over the border is only going to get more difficult, and finding the terrorist hiding in so much human misery even harder.

"(CNN)Either one or two suicide bombers struck outside a stadium Monday in Gombe, Nigeria, after President Goodluck Jonathan ended a campaign rally at the site and had left, officials said. Police said one female bomber detonated explosives, killing herself and another person.  But rescuers and medical sources said both women were suspected to be suicide bombers. The number of injuries was also unclear. Fwaje Atajiri of the Gombe Police Command said six people had minor injuries.  Rescuers and medical sources reported 18 people injured in a blast were being treated at a hospital. The bomber was ""a long distance"" from where the rally had taken place, due to security measures, Atajiri said. Jonathan had left an hour earlier and was already out of the city when the blast occurred, he added. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast.

"(CNN)Shiite Houthi rebels overtook the presidential palace in Yemen's capital, Sanaa, on Tuesday, marking what a government minister called ""the completion of a coup."" ""The President has no control,"" Minister of Information Nadia Sakkaf told CNN as clashes raged. President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi was thought to be in his private residence at the time -- not in the palace. There were reports of clashes near the residence. And the Prime Minister's residence was under attack from the street, Sakkaf said. The regime still controlled the city of Aden, and it closed the port of Aden as well as roads leading into and out of Sanaa, according to Yemeni state TV, which is controlled by the government. The global stakes are high. Yemen is home to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, the terror network linked to such attacks as the recent slaughter at French satirical publication Charlie Hebdo. AQAP also tried to blow up a plane landing in Detroit in 2009. The battle against AQAP has helped make Yemen's government a U.S. ally in the fight against al Qaeda. A power vacuum often benefits terrorist groups. The Yemeni government has been grappling with pressure not only from the Sunni Muslim AQAP but also from Houthi militants, Shiite Muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority Sunni country. Seven things to know about Yemen . ""We are the victims of corruption and false promises,"" Houthi rebel leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi said in a televised address on a network controlled by Houthis and based in Beirut, Lebanon.  ""The government did not respect the peace and partnership deal from September.  We are trying to bring some legitimacy to the government."" He complained of economic struggles and poverty. Al-Houthi also said there is an international conspiracy to link Yemen to the attacks in Paris. ""Yemeni people have two options -- to move against the foreign agendas, or stand against them firmly since they seek to spread chaos in Yemen. This is why we moved with the Yemeni people though many powers inside and outside Yemen are angered. But the Yemeni people are with us and understand our goals,"" he said. AQAP claimed responsibility for the Charlie Hebdo attack, and U.S. investigators have worked on the assumption that attacker Said Kouachi met the late American terrorist cleric Anwar al-Awlaki at some point in Yemen and received orders from AQAP, a U.S. official told CNN. Tuesday's developments came a day after heavy fighting between government forces and Houthis left nine people dead and 67 others injured, Yemen's Health Ministry said, before the sides agreed to a ceasefire. Gunfire could be heard sporadically across Sanaa on Tuesday. Unknown assailants fired shots Monday night at a U.S. Embassy vehicle in Sanaa, the U.S. Embassy said Tuesday. The shooters fired first into the air and then turned the guns on the vehicle, the embassy said. The vehicle carried U.S. diplomatic personnel and was at a checkpoint near the embassy at the time. No injuries were reported. The embassy is known to use SUVs that are recognizable as U.S. government vehicles. Two U.S. Navy warships moved into new positions in the Red Sea late Monday to be ready to evacuate Americans from the embassy if needed, a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the planning told CNN. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called on ""all sides to immediately cease all hostilities, exercise maximum restraint, and take the necessary steps to restore full authority to the legitimate government institutions."" Members of the U.N. Security Council were briefed by the U.N. special adviser on Yemen, Jamal Benomar, and later issued a statement expressing their concern about the crisis. They stressed that Hadi is the country's ""legitimate authority."" ""The members of the Security Council emphasized that all parties and political actors in Yemen must stand with President Hadi, Prime Minister Bahah, and Yemen's Cabinet to keep the country on track to stability and security,"" the statement read. Houthis swept into the capital last year, sparking battles that left more than 300 dead in a month. In September, they signed a ceasefire deal with the government, and Houthis have since installed themselves in key positions in the government and financial institutions. But tensions flared again last weekend as Houthis said they abducted presidential Chief of Staff Ahmed bin Mubarak in Sanaa on Saturday. Osama Sari, senior media adviser to the Houthi movement in Yemen, said Houthis detained bin Mubarak because the President wanted to introduce a new constitution without the Houthis' approval.

"(CNN)Online solidarity strikes again. A fundraising campaign to support a disabled pensioner who was a victim of a mugging attack has raised more than £300,000 ($452,000) towards a new home. An assailant shoved Alan Barnes, 67 -- who is just four feet six inches tall and partially blind -- to the ground and demanded he hand over his money in Gateshead, a town in the north east of England. Barnes suffered a broken collar bone, but his attacker left empty handed. Beautician Katie Cutler read about the attack on a British newspaper website and created a fundraising page via the GoFundMe website. She says that Alan is too scared to return home and she would like to raise £500 to help towards a new house. ""After reading his article on the Mirror.co.uk I was so upset that anyone could target a disabled pensioner & be so cruel,"" she says on the page. ""We can't take away what has happened but with a little donation we can make the future a prettier one & help towards the cost of his new home. Thank you all."" A staggering £302,000 ($455,000) later -- and growing -- Cutler took to Twitter to express her gratitude towards the generosity of the online community. The donations were not just monetary either -- Cutler says a man has offered to fit a new kitchen for Barnes; another has pledged to decorate his new home. Northumbria Police are still searching for the attacker and appealing for further information. Detective Constable Chris Neil said: ""This was a cowardly assault on a vulnerable man who wasn't able to defend himself. His disability means he is partially sighted and quite short and it's disgraceful that someone would target him.""

"(CNN)In ""The Godfather Part II,"" Michael Corleone famously responds to a U.S. senator's demands by saying, ""My offer is this: nothing."" Since President Barack Obama announced his normalization deal with the Cuban regime in December, life appears to be imitating art. Last week, Cuban President Raul Castro declared that his regime would not even entertain the Obama administration's requests to normalize ties until the United States abandons our naval base at Guantanamo Bay, ends the trade embargo, ceases pro-democracy radio and television broadcasts into Cuba and compensates the regime for ""human and economic damages"" the U.S. has, according to him, inflicted on the Cuban people. Last month, the regime's lead negotiator summed up its position even more succinctly after the first round of U.S.-Cuba normalization talks in Havana, saying, ""Change in Cuba is not negotiable."" In other words, emboldened by the first wave of concessions Obama gave the Castro regime in the form of access to more U.S. dollars, it wants even more in exchange for nothing. When dealing with tyrants, you can't wear them down with kindness. When that approach is attempted and one-sided concessions are made, tyrants don't interpret them as good faith gestures. They interpret them as weakness. This is a lesson the Obama administration has failed to learn from its dealings with Iran, North Korea and Russia, and even terrorists such as the Taliban. On Tuesday, the American people will have their first opportunity to hear from the Obama administration about its dealings with the Castro regime when I chair a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere affairs. I look forward to hearing the perspectives of State Department officials, even though I am already concerned by the administration's reluctance to allow the American people to hear directly from the two White House officials who negotiated the deal with the Castro regime over the course of 18 months of secret negotiations, and without the input of our government's top diplomats and negotiators. Many important questions remain about what exactly the Castro regime has done in exchange for Obama's softening of travel and banking regulations that will now allow more U.S. dollars to fill the Castro regime's coffers. For example, it's unclear why, with all the economic leverage it initially brought to the table, the administration apparently accepted a deal to free conditionally 53 political prisoners -- many of whom were released, but with charges pending or were threatened with more jail time if they renew their pro-democracy work. Indeed, some have already reportedly been rearrested in addition to hundreds of new detentions since the December announcement. Questions also remain about what, if anything, the administration has done to secure the repatriation of what the FBI estimates to be more than 70 fugitives from justice being provided safe harbor in Cuba, including known cop killers such as Joanne Chesimard. Also unknown is what, if anything, the administration intends to do to secure billions of dollars' worth of outstanding American property claims and judgments against the Cuban government. The list of questions and concerns like these goes on and on. In recent months, I've made clear that I believe the President and his allies in Congress are misguided for supporting a policy that gives away practically all the leverage the United States has to bring about democratic change in Cuba in exchange for virtually nothing. While reasonable people can disagree on the merits of what U.S.-Cuba policy should be in the 21st century, no serious person can argue that America is stronger when we give a cruel regime such as the one in Cuba everything it wants from the United States, including money it uses to repress its opponents, while we get nothing in return except more anti-American bluster from a geriatric dictator. With Cuba in the news recently, many Americans are asking why Cuba matters to them and why they should care. The simple answer is that what happens with Cuba has far-reaching and potentially damaging implications far beyond the island nation. Cuba is not the only rogue regime with which Obama is engaging in an attempt to end bad behavior. When America sits at the negotiating table with one tyrant or radical regime, the others -- from Iran to North Korea and elsewhere -- watch closely and learn best practices that they can apply to advance their own anti-American agendas. Just as the Cuban regime reportedly cited our swap of five members of the Taliban in the negotiations for Alan Gross' release, the Iranians watched how North Korea exploited U.S. diplomacy, slow-walked negotiations and ultimately achieved their goal of developing a nuclear weapon. There should therefore be no doubt that regimes around the world will be looking to emulate the Castro regime's so far successful efforts to take advantage of Obama's weaknesses and to undermine the U.S. role as the world's leading economic and military power. When the President settles for one-sided deals with the Castro regime, it hurts the Cuban people and their aspirations for freedom. When Obama allows the Castro regime to get the best of him in negotiations, it emboldens tyrants around the world. As the President's engagement with the Castro regime continues, I will do all I can to ensure that his ""normalization"" does not come at all costs, becoming yet another instance of a failed foreign policy that makes America weaker in the world and, ultimately, less safe.

"London (CNN)There are guards at the gate, guards checking bags, and guards at the door of the darkened room: Security is tight as a drum. The reason for these safeguards is stored under glass, and bathed in a pool of low light -- not jewels or what might traditionally be termed treasure, but four ""grubby brown manuscripts."" In a room packed with illuminated tomes and richly-decorated books of hours, it would be easy to ignore the four tatty sheets arranged in a cabinet along the wall, were it not for the two magic words: Magna Carta. For the first time in their 800-year history, the four surviving ""original"" versions of the Magna Carta have been brought together at the British Library in London -- in an operation planned with military precision. ""It's pretty high security,"" admits June Osborne, Dean of Salisbury Cathedral; its copy of the charter has left home for the first time in decades to join its ""siblings"" in the exhibition. ""We had conservators all around it to make sure that in the transfer nothing threatened the document. But as in all of these matters of security the greatest advantage is secrecy,"" she adds with a smile, refusing to go into detail about how, or when, the priceless page was brought to the capital. ""I can tell you that as Dean I did not know when it moved ... We have taken it really seriously."" It's all a far cry from the days when one of the charter's previous custodians used to hide it under her bed for safe-keeping. ""The librarian, Elsie, felt very deeply about her responsibility for looking after it. The story goes that she occasionally put it under her bed at home and in order to get it under her bed she put it on the basket of her bicycle,"" says Osborne. ""I shudder to think that anybody could have thought that was the right thing to do but ... Elsie probably thought she was doing her best."" By contrast, Lincoln Cathedral's well-traveled version of the charter, which has just returned from a visit to the United States, is no stranger to such serious levels of surveillance, having spent several years under lock, key and armed guard in Fort Knox. ""In 1939, when the war broke out, it was at the World's Fair in New York,"" explains Philip Buckler, Dean of Lincoln Cathedral. ""It couldn't travel back across the Atlantic and so the American people took it in. ""It was kept at the Library of Congress for several years, but when the U.S. entered the war it was not safe in Washington D.C., and so it went into Fort Knox, and there it was held, with all of the other great treasures of America -- and the bullion, obviously -- until 1946."" Today, the Magna Carta is revered around the world as the document that established the principle that everyone -- including the King himself -- was subject to the rule of law. That key clause -- nestled among long-forgotten details about fishing rights and noble widows' dowries -- has become a central tenet of democracies across the globe, from the U.S., whose Constitution and Bill of Rights were directly influenced by the Magna Carta, to Australia, New Zealand and India. ""It really is an iconic document, one of the most famous documents in the world,"" says Claire Breay, head of Medieval manuscripts at the British Library. ""It has become such a powerful symbol over the centuries for all sorts of rights and freedoms."" But back in 1215, it was effectively a peace treaty. ""It was a practical solution to the political crisis the country was in at the time,"" explains Breay, a way of bringing to an end a long-running conflict between King John and his barons. And although the monarch signed it -- under sufferance -- he soon changed his mind and had it annulled by the Pope. It wasn't until his successors revived the Magna Carta in the years after his death that it began to take on such importance. Nowadays, it is studied in schools from Seattle to Sydney. More than 43,000 people from all over the world applied for tickets to the exhibition; just 1,215 of them will get the chance to see the quartet of charters over the next three days. Academics and Magna Carta experts will also get a unique chance to study the four documents side-by-side, looking at differences in text, handwriting and condition for clues to their past. ""It's a great opportunity for all four to be looked at, to be compared and contrasted,"" said Chris Woods, director of the National Conservation Service. ""There's a great deal we still don't know about each of their individual histories, but there are things we can learn about them, particularly by comparing them."" Julian Harrison, curator of Medieval manuscripts at the British Library, says it is a miracle the documents have survived -- one was badly damaged in a fire in the 18th century, and ""The other was reputedly found in a London tailor's shop in the 17th century -- that's a bit frightening because what was it doing there? Presumably it was going to be cut up to be used to make gentlemen's collars."" Once the landmark display comes to an end, the visiting versions will be sent home to Salisbury and Lincoln, where they, like the two held permanently by the British Library, will star in individual exhibitions marking the 800th anniversary of the charter, attracting thousands more visitors on a ""pilgrimage"" to see their own piece of history. ""It has become a relic in the best sense of the word, in that it represents a whole tradition,"" says Justin Champion, professor of history at the University of Holloway. ""It is a bit of a disappointment when you first see it... [it's a] grubby brown manuscript,"" but, he insists, it is much more than that. ""The Magna Carta [has become] not just an artifact [but] an idea -- and as we know ideas are much more dangerous than things."" Magna Carta: Law, Liberty, Legacy is at the British Library from March 13  to September 1, 2015; Magna Carta: Spirit of Justice - Power of Words is at Salisbury Cathedral from March 7, 2015 and Magna Carta: Power, Justice and Accountability is at Lincoln Cathedral and Lincoln Castle from April 1, 2015.","Four surviving copies of the 1215 Magna Carta have gone on display in London to mark document's 800th anniversary .

"The Republican establishment won big during this year's midterm elections, fending off far-right candidates in primary races who might have threatened the party's bid to retake full control of Congress. 2016 will be tougher. GOP leaders will have to keep an eye on a wide-open presidential primary, along with internal party fights at the House, Senate and gubernatorial levels. That could spread the party thin and leave an opening for conservative activists to pluck off establishment leaders with greater ease, particularly in congressional races as much of the attention shifts to the battle for the White House. Conservatives, smarting from their losses this cycle, are already getting organized for 2016. And they came out of this month's government spending fight furious that congressional Republicans produced no tangible response to President Barack Obama's immigration executive action and convinced that Republicans are still ceding issues to Democrats after the election. Daniel Horowitz, a conservative strategist and editor of the site ConservativeReview.com, said that now that Republicans have control of Congress, ""there's nowhere to run, and nowhere to hide"" for those who haven't kept their promises to the GOP base. ""You can only fool most of the people some of the time,"" he said. ""Every capitulation [congressional Republicans] engage in, every primary they win by getting across the finish line and they don't do what they've promised — it becomes that much tougher for them to defend."" Trent Lott, the former GOP Senate majority leader, said party leaders need to acknowledge the challenge they'll face with the presidential race at the top of the ticket. ""You have to go into it realizing what's going on in the Republican presidential primaries will have some effect on the House and Senate primaries,"" Lott said in an interview. ""What they need to do — that they did well in 2014, but they need to do even better this cycle — is reduce the number of open seats, and recruit solid contenders."" The dynamic underscores the competing priorities among Republicans heading into 2016. Establishment leaders view moderate candidates like Jeb Bush or Chris Christie as their best shot at winning the presidency. But conservatives believe that type of candidate would only follow in Mitt Romney's path to a disappointing loss, and are pushing for bomb-throwers like Sens. Ted Cruz or Rand Paul. The debate will play out at a time when Republicans are vulnerable on Capitol Hill. Though they will hold majorities in both chambers, Republicans face a daunting map in the Senate, where they'll defend 24 seats in 2016 -- seven in states that Obama won twice. Establishment Republicans see a need for more centrist nominees to defend those states in particular, and yet those centrist incumbents — senators like John McCain of Arizona and Rob Portman of Ohio — already have targets on their backs. Paul Lindsay, spokesman for the establishment-friendly outside group American Crossroads, said nominating strong candidates takes on added urgency because of the tough political terrain for Republicans. ""I think [candidate quality] is very important, especially given the fact that we have the Senate and we'll want to make sure that we maintain it — and we have a map with a lot of Republican senators who are up for reelection in purple or blue states that Obama won,"" he said. The memory of Todd Akin, the Missouri Republican Senate candidate who created headaches for candidates up and down the ballot with his comments on rape and pregnancy in 2012 — and lost a winnable race — hasn't faded from the minds of Republican strategists. They are wary that another fringe nominee could undermine the party's shot at the White House this year. Building on lessons from that cycle and 2010,  national Republicans this year decided to aggressively engage in primary fights to help nominate strong candidates, and the strategy brought the GOP great success. But their primary successes took huge amounts of resources from the establishment, both financial and human, and considerable message discipline across the GOP. Along with the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Chamber of Commerce and American Crossroads all poured millions into primaries to defend incumbents and beat back conservative challengers. Establishment strategists that engaged in primary fights this past cycle acknowledged with a wide-open, high-stakes presidential primary splitting attention and resources away from House and Senate primaries, conditions are ripe for an underfunded, insurgent challenger to slip through to the general. Austin Barbour, an adviser to a Mississippi-based super PAC that helped Sen. Thad Cochran fend off an unexpectedly tough challenge from the right, said incumbents this cycle should see Cochran's race as a cautionary tale. Fundraising ""has to be a concern,"" he said. ""You have to raise a ton of money and make sure you have a strong political organization in your state,"" he said. ""They're all going to require human capital, as well as financial capital, to win those races"" in 2016. GOP strategist Chris LaCivita, who advised the NRSC last cycle and was sent to help Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts overcome an unexpectedly strong independent challenger, said on that front in particular, the presidential primary could make things tougher. ""There's gonna be a lot of competition for money, a money and time-suck is going to really have an impact on Senate and House candidates, especially challengers,"" he said. Indeed, Lindsay said the group again plans to engage heavily in primaries. But he acknowledged it will be tougher to raise the money. And there's also the prospect that typically fringe candidates won't need the money to pick up traction, with a conservative presidential candidate offering them some lift. That could also complicate the party's message downballot, if incumbents and establishment candidates are asked to answer for gaffes or controversial comments made by conservative candidates engaged in the presidential primaries. And having a conservative-vs.-establishment fight at the presidential level could force some downballot candidates to address some of the more policy issues they can typically skirt, like welfare reform or disaster relief, that could be problematic for a nominee in a general election. Horowitz said conservatives see that as a key advantage of the upcoming cycle. ""We do have a net benefit of a presidential election, where you have prominent people at the top of the ticket discussing those issues and forcing some of those individual candidates downballot to go on the record,"" he said. But Ron Bonjean, a veteran Republican strategist with close ties to establishment groups and candidates, said that could be the GOP's ""biggest challenge."" ""Our biggest concern is making sure that Republicans and candidates are running their statewide programs — and not falling into the challenges of the presidential primary campaign trail,"" he said. Preparing for that potential is already underway. Incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is in talks to launch a new super PAC geared towards Senate races, likely to bolster the NRSC and Crossroads in helping nominate strong candidates and engage in the general election fight. The NRSC has met with the chiefs of staff of all incumbent senators up for reelection. But Tea Party groups say they're recalibrating as well, preparing for what ForAmerica President Brent Bozell called ""real combat."" ""It's going to be real combat between the moderates and the conservatives in the party — it's going to come to the surface in a pretty dramatic way,"" he said.","The Tea Party lost nearly every one of its battles in 2014, but may have a better shot this cycle .
With three levels of primary fights, the establishment's attention and resources will be split .
Establishment groups are already gearing up for another costly and divisive battle ."

"It's a slice of life you don't often hear about. Shortly after a manager at a Pizza Hut franchise in Elkhart, Indiana, announced that he was fired for refusing to open on Thanksgiving Day, the company is offering him his job back. Tony Rohr, 28, had worked for the chain for more than 10 years. When he refused to open on Thanksgiving Day this year and force his employees to work, he says, he was told to write a letter of resignation. Instead, he wrote one explaining why the store should remain closed. ""I said, 'Why can't we be the company that stands up and says we care about your employees and you can have the day off?'"" Rohr told CNN affiliate WSBT Wednesday.  ""Thanksgiving and Christmas are the only two days that they're closed in the whole year. And they're the only two days that those people are guaranteed to have off to spend with their families."" Who wants to work on Thanksgiving? Rohr told the affiliate he refused to quit and detailed his frustration in the letter. ""I accept that the refusal to comply with this greedy, immoral request means the end of my tenure with this company,"" he says he wrote. ""I hope you realize that it is the people at the bottom of the totem pole that make your life possible."" He was fired shortly after, he says. The local franchise told the affiliate that Rohr was not fired, but quit. Now, Pizza Hut's corporate office says the franchise ""made a serious error in judgment, one which we hope to help remedy."" It sent CNN a statement that said the store has agreed to hire him back. ""We fully respect an employee's right to not work on a holiday, which is why the vast majority of Pizza Huts in America are closed on Thanksgiving,"" the corporate office said in a statement. ""As a result, we strongly recommended that the local franchisee reinstate the store manager and they have agreed. We look forward to them welcoming Tony back to the team."" But Rohr, who was managing some 15 people when he departed, said Thursday that he was not sure he wanted to return to the team. ""That's something I can't decide right away,"" he told CNN in a telephone interview as he prepared to celebrate Thanksgiving with his family -- and without pizza. ""I'll start looking into stuff tomorrow."" He said publicity about the story has spread. ""All my friends are telling me how cool it is and how proud they are -- 'You're my hero' and stuff you don't expect to hear,"" Rohr said. ""No, I'm just some guy who told his boss 'No' and got burned. There are people who save lives.""","""I'm just some guy who told his boss 'No' and got burned,"" says Tony Rohr .

"(CNN) -- The human rights record of 2022 World Cup hosts Qatar is under the spotlight again after two Nepalese-British workers ""disappeared in Doha following harassment by the police,"" according to a non-governmental organization. The Norwegian NGO Global Network for Rights and Development (GNRD) says its employees Krishna Upadhyaya, 52, and Ghimire Gundev, 36, both vanished while working in the Gulf State. The pair went missing on August 31, and a spokesperson for the UK embassy in Doha confirmed to CNN that it is investigating their disappearance. CNN has contacted Qatar's interior ministry on several occasions but has yet to receive a response. Upadhyaya, a human rights researcher, and Ghimire, a photographer, arrived in the country on August 27 and had been working on a report around migrant working conditions. In February, organizers of the 2022 World Cup published a ""workers' charter"" which they said represented ""tangible progress"" in addressing widespread concerns over migrant workers' welfare. According to GNRD, the missing men stayed at the Grand Hyatt Hotel, Doha, and were working from the Nepalese embassy. While it has been confirmed that Upadhyaya did check out of the hotel, he remained in reception after revealing to a friend in Norway that he felt unsafe. ""Mr. Upadhyaya expressed alarm at the number of police in the vicinity, and noticed undercover authorities who came extremely close to him whenever he spoke on the phone,"" said a GNRD statement. ""GNRD has since contacted the British Embassy in Doha, who has reported that Mr. Upadhyaya checked out from the hotel but did not board his flight. ""GNRD holds the Qatari authorities responsible for their safety. In the event that its employees are subjected to any kind of physical or psychological harm, GNRD is prepared to take all necessary legal action."" The NGO said it is in contact ""with all relevant Foreign Ministries and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights"" as it seeks to secure the safe return of both British citizens. ""We request the immediate cooperation from Qatari authorities to fully disclose the whereabouts and current situation of Krishna Upadhyaya and Ghimire Gundev,"" it added. Upadhyaya, who is married with two children, has been working in the human rights sector for the past two years. He had traveled to Doha to finish a report on migrants who were reported to be overworked and forced to live ""a life of misery and destitution,"" according to GNRD. Gundev, who is from London and is also married with two children, has been involved in a number of human rights projects during his career. After being awarded the right to stage the 2022 World Cup, Qatar's human rights record has come under intense scrutiny. A report released by Amnesty International last November alleged that the abuse of migrant workers was rife within Qatar's construction sector, while British newspaper The Guardian likened the conditions for such workers to ""modern-day slavery."" The furor which surrounded ""stranded"" footballer Zahir Belounis also raised questions regarding Qatar's kafala law, which makes it difficult for workers to leave the country without their employer's permission. Sepp Blatter, the president of football's world governing body, FIFA, described the conditions for migrant workers in Qatar as ""unacceptable,"" but has so far refused to entertain the idea of moving the 2022 competition to another country. In response to Amnesty's allegations, the director of the Human Rights Department at Qatar's Foreign Ministry said laws are in place to protect workers' rights including working conditions, pay and accommodation, adding: ""The living areas go through routine and unscheduled inspection."" But Sharan Burrow, General Secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation, says ""Qatar seems to think that creating a climate of fear and intimidation will somehow turn the eyes of the world away from its modern slavery economy."" She added: ""Hundreds of migrant workers, many of them women, are languishing in Doha's detention centers simply for running away from abusive and violent employers. ""Foreign journalists have been detained for trying to report the truth, and state repression is actually increasing in a country that already showed no respect for basic human rights and legal standards."" Qatar is spending a reported $200 billion on infrastructure and building projects associated with its first staging of football's global showpiece. FIFA has also still to decide the actual dates for the 2022 World Cup after fears that the searing heat in Qatar in the summer will be dangerous for players and spectators. There have been widespread calls for a ""Winter World Cup"" and FIFA says it is consulting stakeholders, including the major European leagues, before making a final decision.","Two human rights workers have gone missing in Qatar .

"Washington (CNN)When Supreme Court justices opened the current term in October by declining to take up several gay marriage cases, it seemed they might avoid the blockbuster docket of the past few years. How things have changed. By November, the Court accepted yet another challenge to the Affordable Care Act—the signature legislative achievement of the Obama administration. In a matter of weeks, the justices heard arguments concerning pregnancy discrimination in the workplace and the First Amendment implications of threats made on Facebook. In January, they decided to take up a challenge to gay marriage, and for good measure, also agreed to hear a case regarding Oklahoma's lethal injection protocol. ""The term went from being one of the more uneventful terms in recent years to potentially one of the biggest ones in a generation"" says Supreme Court expert Amy Howe who is the Editor of Scotusblog.com. Here's a glimpse of some of what has been decided, what has been heard and what is to come: . WHAT HAS BEEN DECIDED . Religious freedom in prison: A unanimous Court ruled in favor of the religious freedom claims of Gregory Holt, an Arkansas inmate who wanted to grow a beard in accordance with his Muslim faith, but was blocked by the Department of Corrections' policy that forbid beards except for diagnosed dermatological problems. Justice Samuel Alito wrote the opinion holding that the prison policy violated a federal law designed to protect the religious exercise of prisoners. The Becket Fund for Religious Freedom proclaimed the decision a ""huge win for religious freedom"" for all Americans. But in a very brief concurring opinion, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, joined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, distanced the case from last year's Hobby Lobby decision. WHAT HAS BEEN HEARD . Separation of powers: A 12 year old American boy, born in Jerusalem, is caught in the middle of a significant dispute between Congress and the executive branch. The disagreement began in 2002 when the parents of Menachem Zivotofsky sought to have ""Israel"" recorded in his passport as the place of his birth pursuant to a federal law passed in 2002.  Sounds simple right? Not according to the State Department, which refuses to implement the law. The executive branch says that because Israeli and Palestinian leaders have long been engaged in a dispute over the status of Jerusalem, it avoids any official act that might be perceived as taking sides. The current policy is to list ""Jerusalem"" as the place of birth instead of ""Israel."" The Zivotofskys seek to compel the State Department to follow the law. They argue that Congress has broad power over passports, and that this case is about the identify of a passport holder. A lower court disagreed holding that the law ""impermissibly intrudes"" on the president's authority to decide whether and on what terms to recognize foreign nations. Race and redistricting: Recently, conservative Republicans have accused Democrats of using racial considerations improperly in the drawing of legislative maps. Not in this case. Democrats are challenging plans drawn by a Republican-led legislature. The Democrats say the plans packed too many blacks into too few districts. Experts like Richard Hasen of University of California Irvine, say the opinion could offer clues of how much the Court is willing to tolerate race-conscious districting under the Voting Rights Act  ""consistent with a belief that all race conscious efforts are subject to close scrutiny."" Facebook and the First Amendment: ""There's one way to love you but a thousand ways to kill you."" That's one of the messages Anthony D. Elonis posted on his Facebook account after his wife left him. Other postings were so violent that his former wife sought protection and Elonis was ultimately convicted under a federal threat statute. But he's seeking to overturn his conviction. He argues he was devastated after his wife left him and that he turned to rap lyrics as therapy. He says much of what he wrote was similar to the work of his idol Eminem. The case offers the justices an opportunity to clarify the scope of the ""true threats"" exception of the First Amendment in the relatively new world of social media. Pregnancy discrimination:  Almost 40 years after the passage of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, pro-choice and pro-life groups have come together asking the justices to clarify the reach of the law. Peggy Young was working for the United Parcel Service in 2006 when she got pregnant and was told by her doctor not to lift anything heavier than 20 pounds for the first 20 weeks of her pregnancy. She asked her supervisor for a temporary accommodation but was told that UPS did not give light duty for pregnancy. She sued, citing the language of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) that says that employers must treat pregnant employees the same as ""other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to work."" Young said that UPS offered light duty for a category of workers and that she should have been included. UPS argued that it treated Young the same way it treated other employees ""with similar lifting restrictions resulting from an off-the job injury or condition"" and did not discriminate on account of her pregnancy. WHAT'S COMING UP . Obamacare: On March 4, the Court will hear a challenge to a section of the Affordable Care Act concerning the subsidies available to individuals who purchase competitively priced insurance from the American Health Benefit Exchanges. As things stand now, 16 states and the District of Columbia have established their own exchanges, while 34 states have opted to have federally-facilitated Exchanges. At issue: who qualifies for the subsidies? The federal government say that ALL qualifying individuals are eligible. But challengers say that the law is clear: only those living in states with state-run exchanges can receive the subsidies. If the Court agrees with the challengers, the ruling could impact more than 5 million people and severely destabilize the entire law. Members of Congress who crafted the law say in a friend of the court brief that  it was ""widely understood that the tax credits would be available to all Americans who satisfied the statute's income criteria regardless of where they lived."" Gay marriage: Sometime in late April, the Court will take up whether states can ban gay marriage. Attorney General Eric Holder has vowed to file a brief and urge the justices ""to make marriage equality a reality for all Americans."" The justices will be reviewing the only recent appellate court decision that upheld state bans. The lower court said in part that the decision should be left to the democratic process. ""The people don't get to decide what the Constitution safeguards,"" says Jon W. Davidson Legal Director of Lambda Legal, ""They don't get to vote to violate the Constitution."" Lethal injection: Three inmates are challenging Oklahoma's lethal injection protocol, after the botched execution of Clayton Lockett last April. At issue is the first drug—midazolam-- used in the three drug protocol that critics say violates the Constitution's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. Lawyers for the inmates say the drug fails to maintain unconsciousness. In 2008, the Supreme Court found that Kentucky's lethal injection protocol was constitutional, but since then states have struggled to obtain drugs and frequently changed their protocols.","Supreme Court term opened by deflecting big cases .
But that quickly as the Court is poised to decide major issues ."
"(CNN)As the world now knows, the star of the Super Bowl was not Tom Brady or Russell Wilson. It wasn't Katy Perry or Missy Elliot. It was the Left Shark. His onstage dance during the halftime show has earned him global acclaim and, I must say, some unfair scrutiny for his seeming missteps. But neither the general public nor the media seem to appreciate just how much work goes into an interpretive, character-based dance such as the one Left Shark performed last night, and how easy it is, if you are committed to your craft, to lose yourself in the moment. Allow me to enlighten you. As a former ballerina, classically trained at the School of the Boston Ballet, I can assure you that Left Shark -- if he is the student of dance I suspect him to be -- trained for months to get inside the head of his character. Literally. Who is Left Shark? he probably asked himself. And why must he dance? What is his relationship to Right Shark? Are they lovers? Enemies? Do they share custody of a boy shark who's starting to ask questions about his parents' separation, for example? This is what true dancers -- or danseurs -- do. As Patrick Swayze's character said in ""Dirty Dancing,"" ""The steps aren't enough. Feel the music."" I speak from experience. At 12 I played a mouse in ""The Nutcracker"" and for months I studied the abrupt movements, barely discernible to the human eye, of other house mice. What moved them? What was their raison d'etre? By the end of my character study I had become that mouse. It took nearly a year for me to drop character afterward. At 13 I played Arabian Coffee in ""The Nutcracker."" Believe me, getting inside the head of an exotic hot beverage would test even Lee Strasberg's imagination. I decided to play it complex: caffeinated but also seductive. I wrote in a storyline about an elephant and a prince that only I knew about, but I assure you, it deeply enriched the character. But by far the most challenging role I was ever tasked with undertaking was that of a sylph -- or an ""invisible being of the air"" -- in a ballet called ""Les Sylphides."" The ballet is non-narrative; there is no plot. My character's motivation was therefore mine to create. I imagined her a malnourished Ukrainian runaway who came to America and discovered the simple pleasures of Capri Sun and ""The Simpsons."" She would return to her homeland one day, but not before she got her bachelor's degree and some much-needed dental work. Externally, she was sweet and vulnerable, but inside she was tough as nails. The part was only four measures long, but I made the most of it. The point is, no detail is too small or insignificant. And this likely explains why, to the untrained eye, it seems like Left Shark was off his mark or forgot the choreography. He wasn't drunk. He wasn't overwhelmed by the lights and the crowd and the music. Nor -- as some have claimed -- was he unable to see out of the costume. This wouldn't stop an artiste. I submit that Left Shark was so engrossed in his character that he felt moved to improvise in the moment. Maybe he envisioned a shifting tide or prey in the distance. Maybe he sniffed a shipwreck or sensed danger lurking behind the palm tree. Perhaps Beach Ball had given him the stink eye. Whatever it was, I'm sure it was intentional. I can recognize a method dancer when I see one. So, leave Left Shark alone. He is soulful and artistic, and I for one look forward to seeing him stretch and grow. Sadly, of Right Shark, I cannot say the same.","S.E. Cupp: Criticism of Left Shark's missteps in the Katy Perry Super Bowl halftime are undeserved.  Left Shark is an artiste .
She says as a young interpretive dancer she worked to plumb the motivations of her characters ."
"Chapel Hill, North Carolina (CNN)For 18 years, thousands of students at the prestigious University of North Carolina took fake ""paper classes,"" and advisers funneled athletes into the program to keep them eligible, according to a scathing independent report released Wednesday. ""These counselors saw the paper classes and the artificially high grades they yielded as key to helping some student-athletes remain eligible,"" Kenneth Wainstein wrote in his report. He conducted an eight-month investigation into the scandal, which has plagued the university for nearly five years. Four employees have been fired and five more disciplined because of their roles. One other former employee had honorary status removed, Chancellor Carol Folt said Wednesday. Wainstein is the former federal prosecutor hired by UNC to independently investigate the academic fraud brought to light by CNN, the Raleigh News & Observer and other media outlets. In all, the report estimates, at least 3,100 students took the paper classes, but adds the number ""very likely falls far short of the true number."" For the first time since the scandal first came to light five years ago, UNC admitted that the wrongdoing went further than academics and involved its athletic programs. In fact, Folt said, ""it was a university issue."" A stellar reputation comes crashing down . UNC has long been a place where it was believed that athletics and academics went hand in hand. It has enjoyed a stellar reputation, producing basketball greats such as coach Dean Smith and Michael Jordan. Now, that reputation has been stained. According to the report, one former head football coach, John Bunting, admitted to knowing of the paper classes and his successor, Butch Davis, also admitted some knowledge. Current men's basketball coach Roy Williams is steadfast that he did not know, Wainstein said. The detailed 131-page report is being shared with the NCAA and could have huge implications for the university. In the past 18 years, UNC has won three national championships for college basketball -- in 1993, 2005 and 2009 -- that could be in jeopardy along with countless wins. And it wasn't just the revenue-generating sports that benefited. The report says that athletes in a wide range of sports were involved, and it notes a noticeable spike of enrollment of Olympic-sport athletes between 2003 and 2005. UNC in January: We failed students 'for years' Report spreads the blame around . For five years, UNC has insisted the paper classes were the doing of one rogue professor: the department chair of the African American studies program, Julius Nyang'oro. Wainstein's report spread the blame much further. It also revealed that it was Nyang'oro's assistant, Debbie Crowder, who actually created the paper classes out of sympathy for athletes and other students who were not ""the best and the brightest."" Nyang'oro went along with them when he figured them out. Crowder was such a fan of UNC sports, particularly basketball, that she would sometimes miss work after a loss, the report says. It was well-known on campus that Crowder was a lax grader and gave high grades without regard for content, Wainstein said, emphasizing that she never gave a grade unless a student submitted a paper and did not change grades that were already given. Wainstein did find that five counselors actively used paper classes, calling them ""GPA boosters,"" and that at least two counselors, one in football, suggested to Crowder the grade an athlete needed to receive to be able to continue to play. Nyang'oro was more hands off. He had initially held legitimate independent studies classes, Wainstein said, but was accused of ""being an ass"" by counselors who felt he was too hard on athletes. Crowder then took it upon herself to create the first paper classes, naming Nyang'oro as the instructor even though she was managing all aspects of them: sending out paper topics, giving grades and assigning no meeting times. ""It is not clear whether Crowder ever got Nyang'oro's explicit approval to arrange these irregular independent studies. It is clear, however, that he ultimately learned about these classes and acquiesced in them by taking no action to put a halt to them."" When Crowder announced she was retiring, there was a spike in enrollment in the last year of her classes, because football counselors urged student athletes to sign up. Crowder actively tried to cover her activities, according to the report. UNC fake class scandal and NCAA's response wind their way to Washington . A strategy to keep players eligible . Former head football coach John Bunting admitted that he knew of the paper classes and said that former Director of Football Cynthia Reynolds told him they were part of her strategy to keep players eligible. Reynolds, who is now an academic program coordinator at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, was one of four employees who refused to cooperate with Wainstein's investigation. The report shows that during Bunting's years as head coach, there was a steady rise of enrollment of football players in the paper classes. Butch Davis, who succeeded Bunting as coach and was eventually fired in the wake of the scandal in 2011, also admitted to knowing there were ""easy classes,"" Wainstein said. Basketball coach Roy Williams maintained he had no knowledge of the fraud, Wainstein said, which was supported by a drop in enrollment in the suspect classes by basketball players during his tenure. There were no findings regarding renowned coach Dean Smith, who is ill with dementia. For health reasons, the Wainstein team was also unable to interview his longtime No. 2 and eventual successor, Bill Guthridge. The report does say that Smith's longtime academic adviser, the late Burgess McSwain, and her successor, Wayne Walden, knew about the paper classes. McSwain, who died of cancer in 2004, was a very close friend to Crowder, the report says. During the Smith years, 1961 to 1997, the report says there were 54 basketball players enrolled in paper classes. Although the paper classes did start in the spring of 1993, the year of Smith's final championship, grades would not have been entered until after the championship game was played. A whistleblower's saga . Many of the academic-athletic staff who were named and implicated by Wainstein were also named by university Learning Specialist Mary Willingham, who went public with detailed allegations about paper classes and who, after a an all-out assault on her credibility by the university, has since filed a whistleblower suit. CNN interviewed Willingham in January about her years working with student-athletes. She said that she had worked with dozens of athletes who came to UNC unable to read at an acceptable level, with some of them reading like elementary schoolchildren. She also said that there were many members of the athletic staff who knew about the paper classes, and her revelations contradicted what UNC had claimed for years -- that Nyang'oro acted alone in providing the paper classes. Whistle-blower in UNC paper class case files lawsuit . Willingham said paper classes were openly discussed as a way to keep athletes eligible to play, and former football player Michael McAdoo told CNN he was forced into majoring in African American studies, the department at the heart of the paper-classes scandal. Willingham shared her reaction to the report with CNN on Wednesday: . ""I didn't need Wainstein to validate me because the truth is validation enough, but I feel like what I've said for the last five years is in the report. ""I gave Chancellor Folt credit; she did a good job,"" she said. Willingham also said she believes it took so many years and six previous investigations because ""this is the flagship of the university system and of the state, and to admit we did anything wrong was too difficult there is a level of arrogance here and that's part of the culture."" Refused to help in investigation . Folt would not say who was fired or being disciplined. Wainstein, however, did name those who refused to cooperate, as: . -- Octavus Barnes, academic counselor for football 2002-2009. -- Carolyn Cannon, associate dean and director of academic advising. 1999-2010, who was the principle adviser for the men's basketball team. -- Cynthia Reynolds, director of football, 2002-2010. She was called a ""critical witness."" -- Everett Withers, interim head football coach in 2011. He's now at James Madison University. Scandal has been unfolding for years . The first hints of scandal began in 2010, with allegations that some athletes were having improper contact with agents. As the university investigated, it found academic irregularities and finally announced, under pressure from the News & Observer newspaper in Raleigh, that there were classes where very little work was required. For the next five years, UNC administration was on the defensive, admitting only to allegations as they surfaced and never digging deep to the root of the problem. Wainstein said he found no evidence that administrators tried to cover up anything. He attributed the five-year delayed response to ""insufficient appreciation of the scale of the problem."" Six previous internally commissioned reports had stopped short of systemic accusations. Folt said that when she took the job as chancellor in October 2013, she decided to hire Wainstein because there were still too many unanswered questions. ""I wanted to be sure that we wouldn't have to do this again and again,"" she said.

"Cairo (CNN)An Egyptian court triggered an international uproar Monday, confirming a death sentence for 183 defendants. The defendants were convicted of murdering 11 police and two civilians in August 2013,  Egypt's state-run MENA news agency reported. Those deaths came in an attack on a police station. It followed a massive, deadly crackdown by Egyptian forces on supporters of ousted President Mohamed Morsy. ""Today's death sentences are yet another example of the bias of the Egyptian criminal justice system,"" said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui of Amnesty International. ""These verdicts and sentences must be quashed and all of those convicted should be given a trial that meets international standards of fairness and excludes the death penalty."" ""Issuing mass death sentences whenever the case involves the killing of police officers now appears to be near-routine policy, regardless of facts and with no attempt to establish individual responsibility,"" Sahraoui added. ""So far, 415 people have been sentenced to death in four trials for the killing of police officers, while the case against former President Hosni Mubarak, involving the killing of hundreds of protesters during the uprising, has been dropped. To date no security officers have been held to account for the killing of 1,000 protesters in August 2013,"" the organization said on its website.  Amnesty International opposes the death penalty altogether. Thirty-four of the 183 defendants were tried in absentia. All are permitted to appeal. In July and August 2013, hundreds of demonstrators -- perhaps more than a thousand -- were killed by Egyptian forces in what Human Rights Watch said ""probably amounts to crimes against humanity."" ""The authorities have failed to hold even a single low-level police or army officer accountable for any of the killings, much less any official responsible for ordering them, and continue to brutally suppress dissent,"" the group said.  It issued a 188-page report titled ""All According to Plan: The Rab'a Massacre and Mass Killings of Protesters in Egypt."" Since August 2013, 343 police personnel have been killed, Egypt's Ministry of Interior says. At the heart of all this is the battle for control of Egypt that has gripped the country for four years. In February 2011, strongman Mubarak was toppled. Morsy, a longtime fixture in the Muslim Brotherhood, became Egypt's first democratically elected president in 2012. But he was deposed a year later in a military coup after mass protests. Also in 2013, Egyptian authorities cracked down on former Morsy supporters. In December of that year, Egypt's interim government officially declared the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization. (Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that controls Gaza, is a branch of the Muslim Brotherhood.) Egypt's current government, led by  President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, has called for a ""religious revolution"" and asked Muslim leaders to help in the fight against extremism.  He has launched a war against terrorism focused particularly on the country's Sinai region where an extremist group recently pledged allegiance to ISIS. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz reported from Abu Dhabi, journalist Sarah Sirgany  from Cairo, and CNN's Josh Levs from Atlanta.","The defendants were convicted of murdering 11 police officers and two civilians .
That attack followed a deadly, widespread crackdown by security forces .
""Mass death sentences"" in police killings are becoming routine in Egypt ""regardless of facts,"" Amnesty International says ."

"Sixty years after the overthrow of Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh, a declassified CIA document acknowledges that the agency was involved in the 1953 coup. The independent National Security Archive research institute, which published the document Monday, says the declassification is believed to mark the CIA's first formal acknowledgment of its involvement. The documents, declassified in 2011 and given to George Washington University research group under the Freedom of Information Act, come from the CIA's internal history of Iran from the mid-1970s and paint a detailed picture of how the CIA worked to oust Mossadegh. In a key line pointed out by Malcom Byrne, the editor who worked through the documents, the CIA spells out its involvement in the coup. ""The military coup that overthrew Mossadeq and his National Front cabinet was carried out under CIA direction as an act of U.S. foreign policy, conceived and approved at the highest levels of government,"" the document says, using a variation of the spelling of Mossadegh's name. While this might be the CIA's first formal nod, the U.S. role has long been known. President Barack Obama acknowledged the United States' involvement in the coup during a 2009 speech in Cairo. ""In the middle of the Cold War, the United States played a role in the overthrow of a democratically elected Iranian government,"" the president said. In 2000, then-U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright spoke of the intervention, and in the same year, the New York Times published what it said was a leaked 1954 CIA-written account of the overthrow. Iranians elected Mossadegh prime minister in 1951. Quickly, the leader moved to nationalize oil production in the country -- a move that would have been a serious blow to the United States and Britain and a win for the USSR. Because of the failure of oil negotiations with Iran, along with a number of other issues, the United States was concerned ""that Iran was in real danger of falling behind the Iron Curtain."" ""If that happened, it would mean a victory for the Soviets in the Cold War and a major setback for the West in the Middle East,"" Donald N. Wilber, a principal planner of the mission, wrote within months of the overthrow. ""It was the aim of the TPAJAX project"" -- that was the mission's code name -- ""to cause the fall of the Mossadeq government; to reestablish the prestige and power of the Shah."" Shortly after Mossadegh's election, the CIA began to plan his overthrow. The goal of the coup was to elevate the strength of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and appoint a new prime minister -- Gen. Fazlollah Zahedi. Before the coup, the agency -- along with the British Secret Intelligence Service -- helped foment anti-Mossadegh fervor using propaganda, according to CIA documents. ""In Iran, CIA and SIS propaganda assets were to conduct an increasingly intensified effort through the press, handbills and the Tehran clergy in a campaign designed to weaken the Mossadeq government in any way possible,"" Wilber wrote. On August 19, 1953, the coup swung into full effect as the CIA and British intelligence agency helped pull pro-Shah forces together and organized large protests against Mossadegh. ""The Army very soon joined the pro-Shah movement and by noon that day it was clear that Tehran, as well as certain provincial areas, were controlled by pro-Shah street groups and Army units,"" Wilber wrote. ""By the end of 19 August ... members of the Mossadeq government were either in hiding or were incarcerated."" In order to provide Zahedi, the country's new prime minister, with some stability, the ""CIA covertly made available $5,000,000 within two days of Zahedi's assumptions of power."" After the coup, Mossadegh was sentenced to death, but the sentence was never carried out. The former leader died in Tehran in 1967. Even 60 years removed, the 1953 coup still hangs over U.S.-Iran relations. Iranian politicians and religious leaders still use the coup as a way to foment anti-American sentiment. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iranian president from 2005 until earlier this year, demanded apologies from the United States for ""crimes"" the CIA committed in Iran during the 1953 coup. ""The issue is more than academic,"" wrote Byrne of George Washington University. ""Political partisans on all sides, including the Iranian government, regularly invoke the coup to argue whether Iran or foreign powers are primarily responsible for the country's historical trajectory, whether the United States can be trusted to respect Iran's sovereignty, or whether Washington needs to apologize for its prior interference before better relations can occur.""","A newly declassified document acknowledges the CIA's hand in ousting Mohammad Mossadegh .

"(CNN)The term ""nightmare bacteria"" does not bode well for anyone who may get infected. That's what CDC epidemiologists call carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE, which kill up to half the patients who contract them. The family of superbugs made headlines two years ago when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned it was spreading. Now, they're back in the news after seven patients at a Los Angeles hospital caught CRE after routine endoscopic treatments for bile ducts, gall bladder or pancreas. Two of them have died, the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center said Wednesday. CRE was a contributing factor in the deaths, but the exact cause of the deaths wasn't immediately disclosed, a hospital spokeswoman said. The medical center is contacting 179 others who had endoscopic procedures between October and January.  It's offering them home tests to screen for the bacteria. Here are some important things to know about the deadly disease. It is a family of bacteria usually found in hospitals and other health care facilities that has evolved a huge resistance to antibiotics. CRE can be so deadly, because few antibiotics work against its different variations. That's what the name ""carbapenem-resistant"" means -- carbapenem is a class of antibiotics often used as a last resort against a bad bacterial infection. But they are no match for CRE, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Not really; they are bacteria that just evolved. The superbug family includes Klebsiella and E. coli, which people have naturally in their intestines. But when they spread to other parts of the body, they can wreak havoc. Some CRE make an enzyme called Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase that destroys those strong antibiotics. The enzyme seems to be a pretty new adaptation; researchers first discovered it in 2001. You don't get it when somebody sneezes on you. You have to touch an infected wound or stool, then touch a vulnerable part of the body -- like an open wound. That's why it doesn't spread on the street but instead in hospitals, where health care workers and others can spread it by touch. Someone may forget to wash their hands after coming in contact with stool or a wound. Or a procedure could be performed with a contaminated instrument, like an endoscope or a surgical device. But CRE can also spread from other soiled invasive medical inserts like respirator tubes or catheters. Those infected are usually patients being treated for some other ailment. These patients have underlying health conditions, which may have left them more susceptible to CRE and other infections. But some researchers warn that CRE could spill over into the streets, too, if they become more widespread in hospitals. No, said the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. The procedure is called endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography or ERCP. It is used among other things to unblock bile ducts and take care of pancreas issues. ""It is estimated that more than 500,000 ERCPs are performed each year in the U.S.,"" ASGE said.  ""From what we know, over the past few years, there have been fewer than 100 known cases of transmission of these problematic bacteria through ERCP."" The ERCP procedure involves a duodenoscope, a flexible, lighted tube that is threaded through the mouth, throat, stomach, and into the top of the small intestine (the duodenum). Its design may impede effective cleaning, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Thursday in a safety communication. The device contains a hollow channel that allows the injection of contrast dye or the insertion of other instruments to obtain tissue samples for biopsy or treat certain abnormalities. The device also has a movable ""elevator"" mechanism at the tip, the agency said. Even meticulously cleaning the devices prior to high-level disinfection ""may not entirely eliminate"" the risk of transmitting infection, the FDA said. ""Reprocessing is a detailed, multistep process to clean and disinfect or sterilize reusable devices. Recent medical publications and adverse event reports associate multidrug-resistant bacterial infections in patients who have undergone ERCP with reprocessed duodenoscopes, even when manufacturer reprocessing instructions are followed correctly,"" the FDA said. ""Although the complex design of duodenoscopes improves the efficiency and effectiveness of ERCP, it causes challenges for cleaning and high-level disinfection. Some parts of the scopes may be extremely difficult to access and effective cleaning of all areas of the duodenoscope may not be possible,"" the FDA said. None of the companies the FDA identified as duodenoscope manufacturers  -- Fujifilm, Olympus or Pentax -- could be immediately reached for comment. Yes, but not many. And some that do can cause kidney damage. But they're only part of the treatment. Caregivers also remove some bacteria by draining off the abscess. Some CRE strains have been reported that are resistant to all antibiotics. On the other hand, some people contract the bacteria without an infection ever breaking out. Cleanliness in all things is important. Wash hands, sterilize instruments. If you're a patient in a hospital, remind staff to do the same, and don't share a room with an infected patient, the CDC said. Also, if you come down with a harsh bacterial infection after medical treatment in another country, be sure to tell your health care provider about that treatment. Some CRE are more common overseas than in the United States. Also, some researchers believe doctors should be careful not to prescribe antibiotics too quickly. The ubiquitousness of antibiotics led superbugs to develop resistance to them in the first place, according to many experts. CNN's Debra Goldschmidt, Elizabeth Cohen, John Bonifield and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","Design of medical scopes 'causes challenges for cleaning and high-level disinfection,' FDA says .
CRE is not one but a group of bacteria resistant to most antibiotics .
People who get infected are almost always recipients of invasive medical treatments ."
"Boston (CNN)Even as the defense for accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev continued its quest to move the trial to another city, prosecutors indicated Thursday that a federal court is drawing close to finding enough unbiased jurors in Boston. Sixty-one prospects have been identified as qualified to decide the capital case against Tsarnaev, Assistant U. S. Attorney William Weinreb announced at a federal appeals court hearing before a three-judge panel. The attorneys plan to pick 12 jurors and six alternates from a pool of 70. U.S. District Judge George O'Toole has turned down three previous defense requests to move the trial. He is convinced he can find enough impartial jurors among the 1,373 people who filled out lengthy questionnaires. The 13th Juror: CNN's Ann O'Neill on the Boston Marathon terror trial . To prevail at the appeals court level, the defense will have to convince two of the three judges that extraordinary circumstances are creating a hardship that is likely to cause irreparable harm. Judith Mizner, appellate chief of the federal public defender's office, suggested that the real harm might be a loss of faith in the judicial system. Jury selection began on January 5, and has lasted far longer than anyone expected. Court also has been closed on six days by snowstorms. The brief hearing on arguments on the change of venue issue interrupted the morning's session of jury selection. It will be the 18th day. So far, 219 people have been questioned closely about their opinions about Tsarnaev's guilt, their feelings about the death penalty and whether they or anyone they knew was directly affected by the bombing and deadly police shootout a few days later. The defense says it is impossible to overcome the bias against Tsarnaev in Boston. Mizner pointed to construction crews working outside the courthouse who have raised ""Boston Strong"" banners and painted the rallying slogan on the sides of cement mixers. ""This attack is viewed as an attack on the marathon itself and an attack on the city of Boston,"" Mizner said. She cited juror responses such as these: . • ""Why waste time on a trial because this guy is guilty."" • ""We should skip the trial and go right to the sentencing."" • ""For this case, I think a public execution would be appropriate, particularly by a mom of a victim at the finish line."" But prosecutors countered that painstaking individual questioning of jurors is successfully identifying people who promise to keep an open mind and decide the case based on the evidence they hear in court. The defense asserts that the trial should be moved because 98% of the people who filled out questionnaires either believe Tsarnaev is guilty, have a connection to the marathon or know someone who was a victim's relative, a first responder or on the staff of the hospitals that treated more than 260 maimed or injured people. Three people, including an 8-year-old boy, died on April 15, 2013, when two pressure cooker bombs went off, just moments apart, near the marathon finish line. An MIT police officer was ambushed and shot to death days later as Tsarneav and his older brother, Tamerlan, allegedly tried to escape capture by police. Tamerlan died in the gunfight. The three-judge appeals court said it will rule later on the venue issue. Meanwhile, jury selection is continuing, with just nine more to be found before each side exercises 23 challenges, dismissing individual jurors without having to explain why. Those left standing will likely end up on the jury of a three- to four-month trial that could be wrenching and gruesome at times. No cameras are allowed at the Tsarnaev trial. But CNN's Ann O'Neill will be there every day. Think of her as The 13th Juror, bringing insights here weekly. And follow @AnnoCNN on Twitter daily.","Defense asking three-judge appellate panel to move Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's trial from Boston .

"""So, how can we promote Seoul as a safe destination in the foreign media in the midst of the current North Korea situation?"" That was the question posed by a Seoul government foreign public relations representative at a meeting on Monday, even as Pyongyang continued its militaristic rhetoric, announcing on the same day that North Korea is pulling workers out of a joint North-South industrial zone. Fearing both short and long term drops in tourism, the Seoul government was seeking advice at a meeting it requested with North Korea expert Andrei Lankov, a professor at Seoul's Kookmin University. ""It's a very important question, but the problem is that the foreign media believes North Korea's threats when they should not,"" said Lankov, who has been studying North Korea for almost 30 years. Throughout the meeting, which took place in Lankov's office, the professor ignored his mobile phone and office land line, even as both rang incessantly. ""Journalists,"" he said, shaking his head. Lankov advised the Seoul government to bombard the media with images showing how the day to day lives of South Koreans have remained unaffected by North Korean threats, and how its residents remain unconcerned by the hostile rhetoric. ""Negative impact on South Korean tourism and the South Korean economy is exactly what North Korea wants,"" said Lankov, who is adamant in his belief that North Korea won't attack the South. ""[North Korean leader] Kim Jong Un is living a wonderful life that is better than any conglomerate owner's life in South Korea -- why would he want to cut that short?"" said the North Korea expert. ""He is therefore the one person South Korea can truly depend on to not go to war,"" Lankov concluded. Impact on South Korea tourism . It seems logical that tourism in Seoul, and all of South Korea, would suffer in the wake of the hostile rhetoric from the North Korean government. Seoul is located just 190 kilometers (118 miles) from Pyongyang, well within range of hundreds if not thousands of North Korean artillery and missile units. North Korea: Our global fear and fascination . However, no country has yet issued alerts or warnings concerning travel to South Korea. ""The Embassy has not changed its security posture and we have not recommended that U.S. citizens who reside in, or plan to visit, the Republic of Korea (South Korea) take special security precautions at this time,"" reads a statement posted on the U.S. Embassy in Seoul's website. There's no denying, however, that some travelers are altering their plans. ""We had two colleagues in New York who decided to push back their business trip to Seoul because of the North Korea crisis,"" said Annie Kim, a Korean American risk manager at a multinational bank. Kim, who arrived in Seoul two weeks ago on business, told CNN she doesn't believe the threats pose a danger. Her colleagues, however, are getting more nervous about the situation with each news report. ""They say they will come only after it all blows over,"" she said. Record month . Despite concerns, tourism numbers in South Korea are up. Way up. Last week, the Korea Tourism Organization (KTO) announced a record number of visitors for the month of March. For the first time in history, inbound international tourists numbered more than a million -- an 11.9% increase compared with the same month last year. Numbers for April won't be available until May. ""We've had record numbers from every country except Japan and Germany,"" KTO's Kang Sun-duk told CNN. According to Kang, tourist numbers are impacted by geopolitics, but not necessarily those involving North Korea. ""Many of the Chinese tourists who would have been visiting Japan are now coming to South Korea due to the island disputes between China and Japan,"" said Kang. China, Japan swap barbs over disputed islands . Approximately 12,000 visitors per day are currently entering South Korea on cruises from China, according to the KTO. Business as usual at DMZ . South Korea's largest airline, Korean Air, and several major hotels in Seoul, tell CNN there has been no noticeable dip in bookings. ""We have not seen any impact from the news from North Korea thus far, but we'll have to see about any further impact,"" a Korean Air public relations representative told CNN. This past weekend at Imjingak, an area within the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) popular with tourists, business appeared down only slightly. Though parking lots were jammed with Chinese tour groups and Korean families on day trips, the DMZ appeared to have fewer Western visitors than usual. ""We've seen around a 20% decrease in business, but it's not too bad,"" said Kim Bong-nam, 57, who has been selling hot dogs at the DMZ for 30 years. ""There was a similar drop in visitors when the Yeonpyong Island shelling happened,"" he said, referring to the 2010 incident when two civilians and two South Korean marines died after a North Korean attack. KTO's DMZ office said tours were operating normally. The KTO was unable to provide specific DMZ visitor data. ""We are not afraid at all!"" said a member of a group of tourists from Hebei, China, when asked why they'd decided to visit the DMZ in the midst of current reports. ""There will be only peace here."" According to Professor Lankov, there's a reason Chinese tourists are unruffled by the threats from North Korea. According to the North Korea expert, Chinese media isn't reporting on the situation in dire tones. He said Chinese reporters haven't adopted the posture of their Western counterparts, ""like CNN and BBC, as if war is going to break out."" ""The Chinese government doesn't allow them to portray their fellow communist country in that light,"" said Lankov.","Seoul government seeks advice on promoting tourism .
Despite rhetoric and threats, tourism up 11.9% .

"(CNN) -- Eight months after the release of a landmark U.N. Commission of Inquiry report on human rights in North Korea, the United Nations is finally deliberating how to address what were described as Pyongyang's crimes against humanity. Commendably, the European Union is taking a leading role in drafting a resolution to respond to those crimes. At the same time, the Commission of Inquiry's report also tells us that European nations, both EU and non-EU, have continued to sell the Kim Jong Un regime luxury goods in violation of several U.N. Security Council resolutions. By doing so, Europe has effectively contributed, and still contributes, to North Korea's heinous treatment of its population. The Commission of Inquiry -- citing reports that a famine that ravaged North Korea in the mid- to late-1990s killed between 450,000 and 2 million North Koreans -- leaves little question about the culpability for this tragedy. Every one of those deaths was needless. What Kim Jong Il, the current leader's father, spent during the famine years -- on weapons, luxury goods and a mausoleum for Kim Il Sung, the nation's founder and the current leader's grandfather -- could have fed every last one of the victims. The fact that a disproportionate number of those sacrificed came from the lower levels of North Korea's political caste system adds a sinister layer to this horrific man-made disaster, in a fraternal nod to the Khmer Rouge's malevolent axiom, ""To keep you is no benefit, to destroy you is no loss."" What may be less known is the way European states have abetted this tale of vast human misery. In 2006, too late to save the victims of the famine, a unanimous U.N. Security Council resolution banned Pyongyang from importing ""luxury goods."" The Security Council has since reaffirmed that sanction, and the EU has duly enacted it into regulation. Yet many European states, both EU member states and nonmembers, have enforced it poorly in practice, permitting what amounts to a ""don't ask, don't tell"" trade in luxury goods for the benefit of Pyongyang's elites. The practical effect of this ""open-minded"" business practice is to empower Kim's cronies as they purchase banned European luxury goods for the elite who help Kim cling to power through repression. In some cases, North Korea purchased its European luxuries through intermediaries, but in many other cases, it bought them directly from European suppliers. For the duration of the famine, Swiss manufacturers reportedly sold Kim Jong Il millions of dollars' worth of watches each year. Meanwhile, according to Kim Jong Il's former sushi chef, Kim's personal shoppers flew to Denmark for pork and to the Czech Republic for beer, and Kim Jong Il was able to purchase luxury cars and cognac from European suppliers. In 2010, according to Radio Free Asia, Kim Jong Il distributed 160 Mercedes-Benz sedans to his cronies. According to statistics released by a South Korean lawmaker, Pyongyang's luxury goods expenditures have tripled since Kim Jong Un's succession in 2011, to several times what the regime spent on importing food for the hungry. Dennis Rodman, the former NBA star who has visited North Korea several times, described Kim's private island and a 200-foot yacht that is a ""cross between a ferry and a Disney boat."" He reportedly added that Kim only served the finest liquor, just as a U.N. survey found that 84% of North Korean households have poor or ""borderline"" food consumption. And last year, a reporter for The Telegraph identified ""Canadian snowmobiles, Swedish snow-blowers and Italian and German snow ploughs"" in photographs of Kim's new ski resort. Swiss authorities refused to allow the sale of ski lifts for the resort, a decision Pyongyang denounced as a ""serious human rights abuse."" Too often, advocates of ""engagement"" with North Korea have overlooked such ethical questions about what this trade has done to its people. In fact, the legacy of the last two decades of engagement with Pyongyang increasingly resembles state capitalism -- the rich and powerful have grown richer, while denying the silent, expendable majority the means to survive by cracking down on smuggling, markets, and private agriculture. According to the United Nations, North Korea -- an industrialized, urbanized, literate society -- has one of the 10 worst cases of food insecurity in the world today, along with predominantly agrarian states in sub-Saharan Africa where illiteracy hovers around 50%. This state of affairs is not the consequence of lack of resources, but of Pyongyang's deliberate choices. As commendable as the EU's leadership at the U.N. may be, it does not absolve European nations of their legal duty to improve their own enforcement of U.N. sanctions -- or their moral duty to force Kim Jong Un to make better decisions about how he spends North Korea's wealth. UN Watch, a Swiss group that monitors the U.N., recently published a call by 20 North Korean defectors, including survivors of North Korea's gulags, for the Swiss government to freeze Kim regime bank accounts. Switzerland should listen to them, and European governments should gradually make those funds available for the purchase of food, provided that Pyongyang permits reliable monitoring of its delivery to those in need. Finally, Europe's SWIFT network, a key processor of financial transactions that recently stopped processing transactions for sanctioned Iranian banks, should also stop processing payments for U.N.-sanctioned North Korean banks. For once, the civilized world should demand that the North Korean state's wealth be used to feed its enslaved and hungry people instead of its privileged and well-nourished elites.","U.N. report on North Korea in February noted crimes against humanity .

"Two weeks ago I visited the Africa Village at London's Kensington Gardens, to appear on a radio show being broadcast from there. After the interview, I lingered, wandering around the national stands, savoring the Nigerian hip-hop that blared from the speakers. I stood in line to receive an inscription -- carefully traced out on paper by a cheerful, elderly man wielding a quill pen -- of my name in English and Arabic. So you can imagine my shock when I heard news of the premature closure of the Village -- fallout of a debt row involving the company managing events at the village, and a key supplier. For me that tragic turn of events symbolizes all that is wrong with sports administration in many African countries. Government funds meant to help Nigeria's contingent prepare for London 2012 -- a total of $14 million, according to Sports Minister Bolaji Abdullahi -- weren't released to the ministry until April, just three months before the opening ceremony. Abdullahi himself was only drafted to the ministry in December 2011, in an acting capacity; his substantive appointment was not announced until May. Now I'm not a sports technocrat, but something in the realm of common sense suggests to me that the Olympics are generally won and lost long before the opening ceremony cauldron is touched by fire. Watch: Games medals versus GDP . Nigeria, an unrepentantly heavy trader in the stock market of optimism, went to London the way it likes to travel to global engagements (be they sporting events or climate change summits) -- eschewing serious preparation, expecting the best, and inevitably attracting the worst, which actually varies in degree depending on the amount of good luck in the air. In the end, the opening ceremony march-past turned out to be the high point of our London 2012 performance. From a tally of four medals in Beijing (1 silver and 3 bronze) we dropped into medal-less oblivion in London. As with Nigeria, so has it been with Ghana (Ghana's last Olympic medal was its Barcelona 1992 bronze in the men's soccer event). Kenya, with a much better Olympic record, has also disappointed in London. The east African country, 13th on the medals table four years ago, with a total of 14 medals, all in long-distance athletics (six of which were golds), dropped to 28th place in London, with 11 medals (only two of which were golds). From the tales of woe filtering out from the various national camps one might be forgiven for assuming it's the same set of officials managing the Nigerians, Ghanaians and the Kenyans. Cameroon's problems are of a slightly different nature -- seven of its athletes vanished from camp two weeks into the Games, presumably envisaging brighter prospects as asylum-seekers than as home-bound Olympians. Across the continent there will be much handwringing and gnashing of teeth in the weeks and months to come. Governments will set up probe panels and probe panels to probe those probe panels. Two years ago, after Nigeria's disastrous outing at the 2010 World Cup, President Goodluck Jonathan, still fresh in office, fired the football federation board and placed a two-year ban on Nigeria's participation in international football competitions. The purpose of that ban, according to a presidential spokesperson, was to ""enable us put our house in order and enable us work out a more meaningful way to engage the global stage in terms of football so that this kind of rather embarrassing outcome we had in South Africa will not repeat itself."" Two years on, our embarrassments have grown muscle and wings. Like Usain Bolt recycling his wins with a certainty bordering on the surreal, we have made a spectacle of recycling our sporting failures. Different arenas, same scenarios. I shouldn't be too negative. It's perhaps not a totally hopeless situation. In a recent interview a chastened minister Abdullahi was quoted as saying: ""If we want to win and compete sustainably, we have to develop systems that establish clear connection between process and outcome."" Sadly systems are something Nigeria is not very good at or keen on building or sustaining. But for now we'll have to trust that the reform-minded minister has it all planned out. ""Failure can have a galvanising effect. And, I believe it is easier to deal with failure than to deal with success. This failure is an opportunity to do the right thing,"" he went on to say. I bet he knows only too well that failure also presents an opportunity to fail again, and fail worse. Which is where the bulk of Nigeria's experience lies. Watch: Looking back at London 2012 . Abdullahi will have to do several things all at once -- fight mafias and cabals for whom self-enrichment is the pre-eminent sport, enlist private sector funding (long stifled by corruption) on a larger scale, rebuild a comatose school sports, raise the standard of the National Sports Festival, and offer his unconditional support to the Segun Odegbamis and Mobolaji Akiodes and others who, against many odds, and often in spite of the government, are striving to build the next generation of sporting talent. None of these will be easy. If the past is anything to go by, time is not on his side. And this is not only because the countdown to Rio 2016 has started. Since democracy returned to Nigeria in 1999, we've had a total of 12 ministers for sport, translating to a new minister roughly every 12 months. Going by that arithmetic, Abdullahi and his lofty dreams already have their expiry date bearing down on them with the speed of Usain Bolt, and the deadly accuracy of Yi Siling. He will therefore be needing large doses of good fortune; the sort that every now and then transforms an underdog into an Olympic champion.","Closure of  Africa Village symbolic of administration failures, writes Tolu Ogunlesi .

"(CNN)The next class inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame could include punk rockers Green Day, the influential Nine Inch Nails and seminal rap group N.W.A. Those are just three of the 15 acts that are nominated for induction into the institution in 2015. Others include Joan Jett and the Blackhearts; Lou Reed; The Smiths; The Spinners; Sting; Chic; Kraftwerk; The Marvelettes; Bill Withers; War; Stevie Ray Vaughan; and the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. In order to be eligible for nomination, a music act had to release its first recording in 1989 or earlier. According to Billboard, that means Green Day and Nine Inch Nails are up for induction in their first year of eligibility. Nine Inch Nails' first album, ""Pretty Hate Machine,"" marks its 25th anniversary this month, and Green Day's EP ""1,000 Hours"" dropped in April 1989. The Smiths, Withers, Vaughan and Sting are newcomers to the ballot as well. (Sting was previously inducted into the Rock Hall of Fame as a member of Police but is now up for induction as a solo artist.) This eclectic group of 2015 nominees ""represent the myriad places where rock and roll converges with blues, electronic, dance, Motown, R&B, funk and other genres,"" Joel Peresman, the head of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation, said in a statement.

"Washington (CNN)Hillary Clinton has yet to declare her intentions to run for president, but the likelihood of a 2016 campaign is such a foregone conclusion that 29 out of 46 senators in the Democratic caucus have already endorsed her all-but-certain plans. Ready for Hillary, the pro-Clinton super PAC that has urged Clinton to run since 2013, has been the force behind seventeen of these endorsements. Senators like Tim Kaine and Mark Warner of Virginia and Dick Durbin of Illinois and have all endorsed the former secretary of state through the super PAC. The group is also currently working to line up more endorsements. ""We've been fortunate to have prominent Democrats lend their credibility, their star power and their grassroots networks to help build a list of millions of Hillary supporters,"" group spokesman Seth Bringman said about the list of high-profile endorsements they have wrangled for Clinton. What's more, every female Democratic senator in the last Congress backed Clinton in a secret letter. ""All of the Senate Democratic women have written her a letter encouraging her to run,"" Sen. Kay Hagan, who lost reelection in 2014, told an audience in 2013. In fact, before Clinton has even declared her candidacy, over 60% of Democratic senators have endorsed her run. Here is the list: .

Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut- Told CNN at a 2014 University of Connecticut event that he ""would support her when and if she"" runs. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey - Booker told NBC News that there are ""few candidates in history"" as qualified as Clinton.

Maria Cantwell of Washington - Signed a letter with all other female senators backing a Clinton run . Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland - Headlined a December 2014 fundraiser organized by Ready for Hillary . Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania - At a 2014 event in Philadelphia, Casey told CNN that it was too early to talk about Clinton 2016. ""I'm not going to get into that,"" he said. But after Clinton announced her run, he emailed supporters to say, ""Having served with her in the Senate, I know she has always been a strong advocate for the middle class and I'm confident she will work tirelessly to ensure that Pennsylvania families have the chance to get ahead and stay ahead.""

Tom Carper and Chris Coons have both side-stepped questions about Hillary Clinton 2016, largely because of uncertainty around whether Vice President Joe Biden -- a Delaware native -- will run. Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey told CNN last year that it was too early to endorse and Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent senator who caucuses with Democrats, is actively pursuing a 2016 run himself. Here is the list of not yet and nos to Clinton 2016: . Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio - In a June interview, Brown said he wasn't ""on board with anybody"" after being asked about Clinton 2016. Sen. Thomas Carper of Delaware - The senator told The Hill in 2014 that ""It's entirely, entirely too early to be talking about anybody running for president."" Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware - ""I think 2016 is a long way off, we have to get through 2014,"" Coons told Politico in January 2014. ""I have always supported Sen. Biden, Vice President Biden, and I think all of Delaware looks forward to a future in which he has great opportunities to serve."" Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont - The independent senator is actively pursuing a presidential run in 2016. Some senators have been unclear about their support of Clinton in 2016. The best example is Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. Reid sent a fundraising email through Ready for Hillary in 2014 and regularly speaks highly of the Clintons. But he has not directly said that he is support her possible run. Here is the list of senators whose support is unclear: . Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado - The Colorado Democrat sent an email through Ready for Hillary in 2014, but to date, has not made it clear that he would back her run in 2016. Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana . Sen. Angus King of Maine - The Maine senator has not said outright that he isn't backing Clinton, but in a post-election interview with MSNBC, the independent senator who caucuses with Democrats said, ""I think that is going to be a difficulty for someone like Hillary Clinton, who has tremendous experience and background, but she's going to have a hard time saying, 'Oh, I'm a new person.'"" Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts . Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey . Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon . Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut . Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan - Clinton endorsed Peters in 2014 and although Peters hinted at Clinton's future, he didn't outright endorse her. ""Whatever she does, she is going to be really great at it in the future,"" he said at the event with Clinton. Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island . Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada . Sen. Jon Tester of Montana - After losing the chamber in 2014, the Montana Democrat was named chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee through 2016. Sen. Tom Udall of New Mexico . Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon .","Twenty-seven out of 46 members of the Senate Democratic caucus - or nearly 60% - are already backing a Clinton 2016 run .
Most of these endorsements have been facilitated by Ready for Hillary, a super PAC urging Clinton to run .
The number of endorsements is a sign that Clinton's run is a forgone conclusion in Washington ."
"(CNN) -- If you woke up this morning, looked at Twitter and wondered, ""Who the hell is Alex from Target?"" you're not alone. If you've been awake for a couple hours and are still wondering why #AlexFromTarget is trending ... Please don't ask us to explain the Internet. According to Urban Dictionary, Alex from Target is ""a hardcore pimp who recently gained fame as an Instagram sensation for reasons beyond the comprehension of any sane person."" For the record, we don't think Alex is actually a pimp. He seems to be a nice kid who works at Target who became famous after Twitter user @brooklynjreiff posted a photo of him in his uniform on October 26. It was re-posted several times over the next few days, and then suddenly, as these things go, the Internet was hooked. There's now an Alex from Target Tumblr. And many pieces of disturbing fan fiction. Several people have noted Alex from Target's resemblance to Jake from State Farm (which, by the way, was a very popular Halloween costume this year). The real Alex from Target, at least according to his Twitter bio, is Twitter user @acl163. If the sweatshirt in his profile photo is any indication, he's from Texas. And that's about all we know about him. We'd love to know what his girlfriend -- or his mom, for that matter -- thinks of all this. (If you're reading this, contact me @jdwilson2.) We imagine the executives at Target are already dreaming up ways to cash in on this little meme. But if they know anything about the teenage attention span, they know they have to work fast. Let's get back to work, shall we?","#AlexfromTarget became a trending topic after a photo was posted on Instagram .

"Washington (CNN)President Barack Obama's budget plan, announced Monday, lays out the President's strategy to fight income inequality against projections that the United States is still far from erasing its national debt. The President's vision is like an opening bid in budget negotiations and will have to be squared with very different ideas expected to come from the Republicans who control the House and now the Senate too. The 10-year plan sets the stage for the economic fight over America's future, with the White House betting voters are ready to turn the corner on spending cuts and embrace his efforts to he thinks will lift up the middle class as well as raising taxes on the wealthy. The White House has touted a growing economy and shrinking deficits as the impetus for proposing a range of measures aimed at helping low- and middle-income families. These would be partially paid for by raising taxes on the rich, such as an increase on investment taxes and getting rid of what President Obama calls the ""trust fund loophole"" in the estate tax. According to the White House, the budget would also install new taxes hitting U.S. corporations storing assets overseas and offer nearly $300 billion in tax cuts aimed at mainly the middle class. On a conference call with reporters, senior administration officials said 44 million households would see an average tax cut of $600 apiece. But officials acknowledged the budget is only a starting point in negotiations with Republican lawmakers who are already criticizing much of what the White House is proposing. In an interview with NBC Sunday night, the President rejected the idea that many of the proposals don't stand a chance in a Republican-controlled Congress. ""My job is to present the right ideas, and if Republicans think they have a better idea then they should present them,"" he said. Obama said he has found over 6 years that, ""when I tell the American people very clearly what direction I think the country should go in, occasionally Republicans start agreeing with me."" He added, just not as quickly as he would like. Obama said he wants to make sure everyone benefits as the economy grows. ""I want to make sure that we have not only recovered,"" but that the administration has built a strong foundation that will prevent the country from ever getting mired in another economic meltdown, he said. Now that the economy is recovering, he said  ""we have to build on it."" The White House argues the budget focuses on making the U.S. more competitive by training future professionals and helping those already with jobs achieve more. The rollout of these programs started in early January, with Obama announcing a range of policy initiatives ahead of his State of the Union speech. Programs include tuition-free community college, early education programs, affordable child care and housing and skill training to increase job mobility. There is increased funding for special education, teacher training and support, and investment in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education. The White House proposes tax credits and initiatives designed to help working parents and caregivers, as well as students struggling with debt. And it looks to incentivize programs providing training, counseling and apprenticeships to Americans and specifically veterans. The budget also looks to change deep cuts, known as sequestration, that took effect in 2013. The President's budget claims that it is time to replace this ""mindless austerity"" with smart reforms, and although Republicans agree that the forced budget cuts are dangerous, reaching a deal on what to replace it with will not be easy. With the reversal of sequestration, Obama will look to increase spending on the military and national defense. The President's budget allocates resources to the fight against terrorist group ISIS as well as training for Iraqi security forces and humanitarian needs in the region. Support for NATO allies and European countries targeted by Russia, stronger cybersecurity defenses and research into combating infectious diseases like Ebola are also accounted for in the budget. Eliminating wasteful spending by modernizing and improving services within the federal government is another way the White House hopes to save money and increase U.S. competitiveness around the world. No matter how amenable Republicans are to Obama's plan, there are some areas where his budget seems far from reality, for example: immigration. The President's budget includes projected savings for an immigration reform bill that passed the Senate but has little chance of passing the House and or making it to Obama's desk. Although immigration is one area where both Republicans and the President will look for savings, the issue is also one of the most contentious. Still, senior administration officials continually point to bipartisan support for some of the budget measures. One example is the $478 billion, six-year proposal to improve roads, bridges and mass transit systems. Funding for the investment comes from taxes on foreign earnings from U.S. businesses, and administration officials say it is similar to a past Republican proposal. As congressional leaders in both parties look ahead to the future spending battle of the coming year, administration officials point back to 2013. Republican Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington found consensus in a ""grand bargain"" budget deal in late 2013 that had something good and something bad for everyone. President Obama wasn't happy with everything in that budget, but administration officials say they are hoping for a similar deal. One area where Ryan, new chairman of the House Ways and Means committee, has expressed frustration with the administration is in entitlement reform. A recent report from the Congressional Budget's Office projects entitlement spending will heavily impact the U.S. economy in the coming years. The CBO projects that the annual federal deficit for this fiscal year will be $468 billion, or 2.6% of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). That number reflects the gap between how much the government spends and how much it takes in. Solid economic growth over the next few years is projected, keeping the deficit at a very modest level until 2018. But after that the CBO expects it to gradually grow to 4% by 2025 as spending on entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and health insurance subsidies -- as well as interest on the country's debt - are projected to grow faster than the GDP. Senior administration officials say that their strategy has never been to erase the deficit all together but rather to keep it at a level that is manageable. The President's budget projects a $474 billion deficit for 2016, or 2.5% of the GDP -- which would remain stable as both the deficit and economy grow. Getting the deficit to below 3% allows for ""sustainable"" fiscal policy while investing in economic growth, officials said, citing economists.","With 10-year plan, White House bets voters have had enough of budget cuts .

"Washington (CNN)At least three would-be Republican presidential contenders have said that vaccinating children should sometimes be done on a voluntary basis, but their careful comments on the issue underscore how problematic it could be for some of them in a primary fight. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul joined New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie on Monday morning in asserting that the choice should be left up to the parents. And BuzzFeed highlighted comments made by former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina last week defending parents' rights on the issue. The scientific community overwhelmingly agrees that vaccines are needed to protect the public, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has provided assurances that the United States ""has the safest, most effective vaccine supply in history."" With the outbreak of the measles epidemic in December — after the disease was eradicated from the U.S. in 2000 -- the scientific community is mobilizing to counter the ""anti-vax"" movement, which has grown over the past decade. RELATED: CDC says 102 measles cases in January, most stemming from Disney outbreak . Paul, in comments on conservative talk-radio show host Laura Ingraham's show Monday, said he's ""not anti-vaccine at all."" ""But particularly, most of them ought to be voluntary,"" he added. Paul cited incidents where you have ""somebody not wanting to take the smallpox vaccine, and it ruins it for everybody else."" ""I think there are times in which there can be some rules, but for the most part it ought to be voluntary,"" Paul went on. ""While I think it's a good idea to take the vaccine, I think that's a personal decision for individuals to take."" He also said he was ""annoyed"" that his kids were supposed to receive the Hepatitis B vaccine as newborns, and that he had doctors space out the 10 vaccines they wanted to give his infant children over time. And in a later interview with CNBC, Paul suggested he had seen the negative effects of vaccines that those in the anti-vax movement cite in their opposition. None, however, are widely supported by the scientific community, and Paul's office did not respond to a request for comment for details. ""I've heard of many tragic cases of walking, talking, normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines,"" Paul said. ""I'm not arguing vaccines are a bad idea. I think they're a good thing. But I think the parents should have some input."" Christie also took a measured approach, saying that while he vaccinates his own children, parents should be able to choose. ""All I can say is that we vaccinate ours. I think it's much more important as a parent than as a public official, and that's what we do,"" he told reporters during his trip to England on Monday. He went on to say that's ""part of making sure we protect their health and public health."" ""I also understand that parents need to have some measure of choice as well. So that's a balance the government has to decide,"" Christie added. Asked whether he was advocating leaving parents the option to not vaccinate their kids, Christie said ""I didn't say I'm leaving people the option,"" but that ""it depends what the vaccine is, what the disease type is and all the rest."" ""And so we have to have that conversation. [It] has to move and shift to disease type. Not every vaccine is created equal. Not every disease type is as great a public health threat as others,"" Christie said. He went on to say that the debate over whether to vaccinate children should measure ""whatever the perceived danger by the vaccine is — and we've had plenty of that over a period of time — versus what the risk to public health is."" Shortly after Christie's comments were picked up by national media, his spokesman, Kevin Roberts, issued an email clarifying the governor's position, asserting that states should have jurisdiction over the issue, as they currently do. ""The Governor believes vaccines are an important public health protection and with a disease like measles there is no question kids should be vaccinated. At the same time different states require different degrees of vaccination, which is why he was calling for balance in which ones government should mandate,"" he said. Christie's careful dance on the issue reflects the potential political trouble brewing over the question of whether parents should vaccinate their children. The Democratic National Committee knocked Christie for putting on a ""tin foil hat"" and ""bowing to junk science,"" warning him to ""sit down and shut up, before people actually get hurt"" in a release. Another group of potential 2016ers also weighed in on the need for children to be vaccinated. Texas' Sen. Ted Cruz told reporters Tuesday that ""children of course should be vaccinated"" and also jumped to Christie's defense, a potential foe for the Republican nomination. ""This issue is largely silliness stirred up by the media,"" Cruz said. ""Nobody reasonably thinks Chris Christie is opposed to vaccinating kids other than a bunch of reporters who want to write headlines."" Cruz added in a statement that vaccines ""have tremendous public health benefits."" ""But on the question of whether kids should be vaccinated, the answer is obvious, and there's widespread agreement: of course they should. We vaccinate both our girls, and encourage all parents to do the same,"" Cruz said. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who is also weighing a presidential run, was unequivocal: children should ""absolutely"" be vaccinated and the practice should ""absolutely"" be mandatory, he said Tuesday. Rubio added to the heap of doctors and experts who assert there is no link between vaccinations. And unvaccinated people, Rubio added, put infants at risk. ""If enough people are not vaccinated you put at risk infants that are three months of age or younger that have not been vaccinated, and you put at risk immune-suppressed children that are not able to get those vaccinations,"" Rubio said. ""So absolutely, all children in America [should be vaccinated]."" Gov. Bobby Jindal said in a statement Tuesday he has ""no reservations"" about the benefits of vaccines and urged ""all parents to get their kids vaccinated."" ""There is a lot of fear mongering out there on this. I think it is irresponsible for leaders to undermine the public's confidence in vaccinations that have been tested and proven to protect public health,"" Jindal said. ""Science supports them and they keep our children safe from potentially deadly but preventable diseases. Personally, I would not send my kids to a school that did not require vaccinations."" President Barack Obama weighed in on the issue during a Sunday interview with NBC, urging parents to get their kids vaccinated. ""I understand that there are families that, in some cases, are concerned about the effect of vaccinations,"" he said. ""The science is, you know, pretty indisputable. We've looked at this again and again. There is every reason to get vaccinated, but there aren't reasons to not."" But despite Obama's insistence that the science supporting the need for vaccines is ""indisputable,"" the vaccine debate has been problematic for Republicans in the past. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry came under fire in the primaries from opponents during his 2012 run for president for issuing an executive order that mandated all young girls must receive a vaccine that protects against some forms of cervical cancer. He eventually flipped on the mandate and supported the Texas legislature's decision to overturn it, saying he made a mistake. ""If I had it to do over again, I would have done it differently,"" he said then. Indeed, Carly Fiorina, in explaining her position to BuzzFeed, referenced that vaccine as one worthy of ""concern."" Paul decried it as well. She drew a distinction between ""a vaccination when a girl is 10 or 11 or 12 for cervical cancer"" and one for measles. ""I certainly can understand a mother's concerns about vaccinating a 10-year-old,"" she said. ""I think vaccinating for measles makes a lot of sense. But that's me. I do think parents have to make those choices."" Richard Greene contributed to this report from London.","New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was asked about requiring vaccines, while he was visiting London .

"London (CNN)Said Osman found his life's calling after witnessing a tragic scene as a young boy that still haunts him decades later. The pioneering Kenyan doctor was just nine years old when a girl was rushed across the border from southern Ethiopia to northern Kenya. A few years his senior, she was severely dehydrated and barely holding on. ""Everyone was trying to resuscitate her and my uncle, a local pharmacy technician, saw the horrified look on my face. I was just a terrified kid, so he took me home."" But Osman couldn't get the girl off his mind. He persuaded his uncle to let him return to the hospital a few weeks later to see the girl. He was amazed to find she had nearly made a full recovery -- something that would inspire him to help others later in life. ""Another human being managed to bring her back to life and I should also be able to do the same if I try my best,"" he recalls thinking. Though friends and family laughed off Osman's interest in medicine, his mother voiced her support. ""You know, these guys have never seen a black doctor before,"" she said at the time. Looking back, Osman admits their reaction wasn't too surprising. He was, after all, living in a rural part of Kenya where nomads form most of the population. But he refused to let that stand in the way of pursuing his dream -- a journey that has taken him far away from his ancestral home and, eventually, to the United States. Medical milestone . Osman is currently based in Frederick, Maryland, near Washington D.C., and best known as a pioneer in endoscopic spine surgery. Patients, who are usually required to spend days in hospital, can often walk out of his clinic just hours after surgery. A fellow doctor from Hawaii became the world's first patient to undergo one of Osman's endoscopic spine surgeries in the mid 1990s. He had the first ever endoscopic thoracic decompression and fusion as an outpatient. A medical milestone, it was the culmination of several years of research. He called Osman three days after his surgery declaring: ""It's the first time in four years that I'm able to stand on one leg while putting on my pants."" But back surgery doesn't come without serious risks. Patients undergoing a currently popular minimally invasive surgery (direct lateral approach for lumbar spinal fusion) face a complication risk of up to 67%. Moreover, such procedures often result in some form of nerve damage. Osman is able to dramatically reduce those numbers by drilling a hole through the pelvic bone. This allows him to access the injured lowest lumbar disc while avoiding damage to spinal muscles or entry into the spinal canal, where nerves can be injured. It also doesn't involve access through the abdomen. The procedure is called trans-iliac approach to lumbosacral junction. Hundreds of surgeries later, Osman says he still hasn't come across any side effects in patients. He does, however, explain that the method still isn't common in the U.S., or around the world. This hasn't stopped Osman from sharing his groundbreaking technique with others. Now, more surgeons are embracing the approach as they become more familiar with it. ""It's my duty to tell the medical community to look at my technique if they truly have the patient's best interest at heart."" He recently released the first clinical result of the approach, while the original study was published in the ""Journal of Spine"" in 1997. He also introduced a technique called endoscopic foraminal decompression the same year. Doctors as far away as South Korea and China are now practicing the method. Dr. Anthony Yeung is best known as the former President of the World Congress of Minimally Invasive Spine Surgery and Techniques (WCMISST). He says Osman's approach is growing rapidly in popularity among spine specialists around the world -- who are now using the procedure on a routine basis. ""These are highly specialized surgeons,"" explains Yeung, who currently heads up the International Intradiscal and Transforaminal Therapy Society. From rural Kenyan boy to world-renowned surgeon . Osman was born and raised in Moyale, a place he describes as ""a small, but cosmopolitan market town between Ethiopia and Kenya."" People from different ethnic and religious backgrounds lived together in harmony -- something he says was unusual for a region largely divided into tribal areas. Each level of education Osman completed took him further and further away from his family. ""Nothing distracted me. I moved forward knowing everything was helping me reach my goal. I also began seeing black doctors the closer I got to Nairobi."" He trained at Kenyatta National Hospital, the country's largest healthcare treatment facility. It wasn't long before word of his success reached local communities in Moyale and those needing medical attention sought out his help in Nairobi. While treating them was a very fulfilling experience, Osman grew frustrated, as he wasn't able to cater to everyone's needs. This, coupled with the need to complete his post-graduate education, eventually led to his decision to leave Kenya. He was accepted to Scotland's prestigious Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1980. ""I'm Kenyan wherever I go in the world and nothing can ever change that,"" Osman told Kenyatta's head of surgery, who was sad to see his favorite student go. Osman eventually relocated to the United States where foreign doctors must get recertified to practice medicine. ""I wanted to advance technology in spine surgery, but how can I do that while I'm doing internships for the next three to four years? So I asked myself, where will the world of spine surgery be ten years from now?"" Predicting the future allowed Osman to spearhead cutting-edge medical procedures while still transitioning to working as a doctor in the U.S. Inspiring the next generation . Some 30 years later, his success story appears to have inspired a new generation of high achievers in his rural hometown. Osman explains his village in Moyale at one point produced the highest number of doctors, veterinary surgeons, nurses and engineers per capita in Marsabit county. He remembers receiving an email from a young man about 10 years ago. It turned out he came from the same village and was studying electrical engineering in Kansas. ""He said if there was no Said Osman, I probably wouldn't be here. I felt tears running down my cheeks and realized that I've achieved what I set out to do. To lead by example, so others can use their potential to get more out of life."" Osman's ultimate ambition is to produce an artificial skeleton, which mimics a natural one as closely as technology allows. That goal could already be well within his reach. He has patents for growing artificial bones and joints -- as well as replacing damaged discs in the spine with biologic materials. ""I still see that 12-year-old girl in front of me,"" he says."" That's who I'm treating every day. If my patients are smiling, then I have achieved my dream."" More from African Voices .","Kenyan-born Said Osman is a world-renowned spinal surgeon .

"In the run-up to the Israel elections, two pieces of conventional wisdom were making the rounds among analysts, diplomats and experts:  First, Benjamin Netanyahu would win big, and second, the victory would propel him on a collision course with Barack Obama, a second term president seeking to do something serious on the peace issue. The first proved to be dead wrong. The second will probably follow suit. ""Bibi"" Netanyahu has just been re-elected prime minister, no less for the third time. But don't get out the popcorn and turn out the lights just yet.  The sequel to the Obama-Bibi wars isn't about to begin. Sure, their relationship has been perhaps the most dysfunctional in the history of U.S.-Israeli ties.  And there are bound to be plenty of downs in the next several years, particularly if Netanyahu is forced to form a narrow right-wing governing coalition. But the U.S.-Israeli relationship is simply too big and important to fail, particularly now. Netanyahu's party wins but centrists flex muscle, polls show . Indeed, given the real prospects that the new Israeli coalition will include Yair Lapid's centrist party (whose surprise showing of 19 seats may make him a  coalition lynchpin) and maybe another moderate faction if Lapid won't sit with other right-wingers in the coalition, the two leaders may have less reason to fight and more reasons to cooperate. Here's why. Second term illusion . The notion that a second-term president freed from the constraints of re-election will now hammer an Israeli prime minister with a big peace initiative just doesn't add up. First, there's no precedent for such a thing in American policy toward the Arab-Israeli negotiations. Bill Clinton's push at Camp David in July 2000  -- the precedent most often cited -- came not from Clinton, but at then-Prime Minister Ehud Barak's urging. Second, it's the presence of opportunity, not the absence of political constraints or the desire to get even and settle scores, that leads a U.S. president to act. A quick look around and any sentient human being would see that a grand deal between Israelis and Palestinians isn't possible now. Lapid's presence in the coalition may restrain some of the Israeli right's ambitions to expand settlements, but it isn't enough to support a full-scale push toward a comprehensive peace. Indeed. Lapid's focus was on economic issues and national service, not on negotiations with the Palestinians. The suspicions between Israelis and Palestinians are too deep, the gaps on the issues too big, and the political houses on each side too divided. More likely, the new Netanyahu government will focus on some kind of interim accord with the Palestinians.  And that leads us to the second reason that a big fight is likely not in the offing. Why fight about nothing? Fighting with an Israeli prime minister (and the Arabs, too) is a part of the job description of serious American mediators. But the fight needs to be productive and worth the effort. Right now, there's nothing to fight about because there's no conceivable Israeli-Palestinian agreement in the offing. You fight when you think there's a way to produce an agreement that would justify the risks of a confrontation, not when you're certain to fail. For Obama, whose domestic agenda will require an enormous expenditure of political capital at home, neither fighting with Republicans and Democrats over pressure on Israel nor launching an initiative that fails is smart politics. John Kerry needs a friend . We are going to have a new secretary of state who will have responsibility -- assuming he can convince the president to let him handle the issue -- for dealing with the Israeli-Palestinian problem. The last thing Kerry wants is a worsening of ties between Obama and Netanyahu that makes it impossible for him to do his job on such a key issue. If Kerry wants to have a chance of succeeding -- even to manage the problem -- he'll need a relationship with Netanyahu based on some measure of confidence and trust. This is even more important given the absence of such trust between Obama and the prime minister. Bush 41 and then-Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir didn't get along. James Baker managed to hammer out a working relationship with Shamir, tense at times but functional. Without it, there would have been no Madrid peace talks. If Kerry is smart, he'll keep the door to Netanyahu open and try to  see if he can't reach some understanding with the prime minister.  If he can't, there will be plenty of time to fight later. The Iranian Issue . The big reason why Bibi and Obama will likely have a stake this time around in more cooperation and less friction is Iran. The fact is neither Obama, the mullahs, nor Netanyahu wants a war over the nuclear issue. But avoiding one will require the closest of cooperation between Jerusalem and Washington. There's an expectation that 2013 will be the year of decision on the Iranian nuclear issue.  Maybe yes, maybe no. But that expectation alone will require intimate coordination to prevent a unilateral Israeli strike, to see whether diplomacy can produce an Iranian-American deal and to determine whether it can be sold to Israel. If not, and no diplomatic fix to the nuclear issue is possible, American-Israeli understandings will be required on a military option. Either way, neither the United States nor Israel can avoid a public falling out over Iran or a major split over how to manage the problem. Simply put, the U.S.-Israeli relationship is too big to fail. That doesn't mean there won't be real differences over settlements, for example, that won't cause friction. But on the two biggest issues of the day, how to manage Iran and the Palestinians, there can't be solutions without close Israeli-American cooperation. It's legacy time. This is Obama's last term as president and perhaps Netanyahu's last term as prime minister. Obama doesn't want to be the U.S. president on whose watch Iran crossed the nuclear weapons threshold and certainly neither does Bibi want to be the Israeli prime minister held responsible. It would be nice to imagine that the two can sit down and reach a broad strategic understanding -- first we deal with Iran, and if we succeed through diplomacy or even war, then let's find a way to preserve the two-state option for Israel and the Palestinians. But even if this doesn't happen, these two leaders are inexorably bound together. They're never going to love each other. But I'm betting they'll find a way to get by without a major fight neither wants.  The fact is the protection of Israeli and American interests and regional stability in a volatile, turbulent Middle East depends on it.","Benjamin Netanyahu is headed for third term as Israel's prime minister .

"Three days before Independence Day, Milton Hall died in a fusillade of police gunfire outside a strip mall. He had been arguing with officers in a parking lot next to a shuttered Chinese restaurant when he was shot, in full view of passing motorists and while he was holding some sort of knife. Saginaw County Prosecutor Michael Thomas said later that the squad of police confronting him opened fire ""because apparently, at this point in time, he was threatening to assault police."" Thomas' office and the Michigan State Police are investigating Hall's death. Saginaw Police Chief Gerald Cliff said Hall was ""known to be an assaultive person"" with ""a long history"" of contacts with law enforcement, ""not only with police from our department but with the county."" Hall's cousin, Mike Washington, acknowledged Hall had been jailed for minor offenses like vagrancy in the past, but, ""He was not violent."" And Hall's mother is growing impatient with the probe and questions why police opened fire so furiously on her son, whom she said was mentally ill. The chart blog: Mental health . ""It appeared to be a firing squad dressed in police uniforms,"" Jewel Hall told CNN from her hometown of Albuquerque, New Mexico.  ""There was another way. They did not have to kill him. He had not done anything. He was not violent. He was not a murderer. He was not a criminal."" Jewel Hall said her son had once trained as a civil right activist, been an avid reader and played football. He had lived in Saginaw for 35 years and received Social Security disability payments for a mental illness, but, ""He knew his rights."" ""Everybody knew him. The police knew him well,"" she said. ""So that's another question: they knew him, so why? Why did they kill him?"" WJRT: Community questions police shooting . The July 1 shooting happened in a parking lot on West Genessee Avenue, a busy commercial strip on the north side of Saginaw. In a video purchased by CNN, shot by a motorist from across the street, the 49-year-old Hall is seen arguing with a half-dozen officers. For more than three minutes, he walks back and forth, and at one time appears to crouch in a ""karate stance,"" according to the man who captured the scene. Police said Hall had just had a run-in with a convenience store clerk. On the video, he tells police, ""My name is Milton Hall, I just called 911. My name is Milton, and I'm p---ed off."" When an officer tells him to put the knife down, he responds, ""I ain't putting s--t down."" He appears unimpressed by a police dog, telling officers, ""Let him go. Let the motherf---ing dog go."" Finally, he turns to the left of the frame, where another officer had moved out of view a short time earlier. It's then that the police open fire with a reported 46 shots in a five-second hail of bullets. ""I'm stunned that six human beings would stand in front of one human being and fire 46 shots,"" Jewel Hall said. ""I just don't understand that. It's a lot of pain in that because it only takes one shot, so the question is why?"" She questioned why none of the cameras in the police cars at the scene recorded the shooting -- ""none of them work."" ""So that's the question I have and the community has is, what's taking so long?"" she said. ""Why is not being transparent?"" Lou Palumbo, a former Long Island police officer, told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" that the video is ""a perceptive nightmare"" for a police department and could reflect a lack of training by the officers. ""This wasn't a scenario where he was discharging a weapon in their direction,"" he said. But Palumbo added that the shooting may yet be determined to be justifiable.  ""One of the things the public has to understand, an individual wielding a knife at you at about 20 feet can be on top of you in a split second,"" he said. ""The public doesn't know this because they don't do this for a living."" Neither state police nor the prosecutor's office would comment on the investigation. In a written statement to CNN, the state police said, ""Our focus is on conducting a complete and thorough investigation, rather than a hasty one."" But Saginaw City Councilman Norman Braddock, who also has criticized the pace of the investigation, said the probe should be a ""top priority."" When CNN showed Braddock the video, which he hadn't seen before, he said, ""This is disturbing."" ""I can see what people are traumatized at, looking at something like that,"" Braddock said. ""We need answers."" Jewel Hall said her family is conducting its own investigation into the shooting, ""and at the end of that investigation we will decide what next steps to take with our legal advisors.""","Milton Hall was killed in a confrontation with police in Saginaw, Michigan .

"A 50-member committee completed Sunday an item-by-item vote on the 247 articles of a new constitution for Egypt, according to a breaking news banner on state-run Nile TV and reporting on state-run al-Ahram Online. The next steps in the process for the the draft to become law are for Egypt's interim President Adly Mansour to ratify the charter on Tuesday and then announce a date for it to be put to a popular referendum. The constitution will replace the one suspended in 2011, al-Ahram reported. Egypt's new constitution would ban religious parties and put more power in the hands of the military, according to a draft posted on state media earlier Sunday. ""The constitution brings back soft power to Egypt. It's the real power that gave Egypt influence and a role and glory,"" Amr Moussa, head of the assembly, said at a news conference on Saturday. ""It deals with the dangerous circumstance through which Egypt passes."" The new constitutional articles come months after a military coup  unseated elected President Mohamed Morsy in July and touched off a series of protests that ended in violence. The painstaking process of approving the draft of the new constitution started Saturday. Also on Saturday, security forces dispersed protesters who were demonstrating against Egypt's anti-protest law. U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel on Saturday called his Egyptian counterpart, Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, to express concerns over the law restricting demonstrations and protests, among others. Hagel told him that Egypt's response to free expression will demonstrate the interim government's commitment to a nonviolent democratic transition, according to a statement from the Pentagon.","The 50-member committee working on the new constitution approves 247 articles .

"(CNN)Even at the age of 7, Lotte Hershfield knew her world was crumbling. She avoided the benches with the sign: No dogs or Jews allowed. She couldn't attend public schools. And the Nazis and their growling German shepherds raided her family's house, throwing their books into a fire. As a child, ""we were very aware,"" said Hershfield, now 84. Jews weren't welcome in their own home. Growing increasingly fearful, her parents and her older brother left their hometown of Breslau, Germany, in 1938 and journeyed to an unlikely new home -- the Philippines. About 1,200 European Jews fled to the Philippines from 1937 to 1941, escaping the throes of the Nazis only to face another bloody war under Japanese occupation. Many of the Jews came from Austria and Germany, as the anti-Semitic policies including the Nuremberg race laws intensified. Unable to immigrate to countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States, thousands of Jews escaped to places such as Shanghai in China, Sousa in the Dominican Republic and Manila. Those who arrived in Manila didn't realize that they had escaped the Holocaust only to be caught in the war in the Eastern Front, where the Philippines came under attack. ""We were going from the frying pan to the fire,"" Hershfield said. ""We went from Nazi persecutors to the Japanese."" The Philippines capital was liberated after a grueling, monthlong campaign in the Battle of Manila, one of the bloodiest battles of World War II, which now marks its 70th anniversary. This little known chapter of history about Jewish refugees in the Philippines has inspired two documentaries and talk of a possible movie. ""We know about stories like Anne Frank, 'Schindler's List' -- the things that grab popular imagination,"" said Michelle Ephraim, whose father, Frank Ephraim escaped to the Philippines after Kristallnacht in 1938. ""Once you bring an Asia element, it becomes so complicated, interesting and surprising."" About 40 of the Philippines refugees are alive today, according to documentary filmmakers. They were children when they arrived in the Philippines over 70 years ago. ""That was like a rebirth,"" said Noel Izon, the filmmaker of the documentary, ""An Open Door: Jewish Rescue in the Philippines,"" in which he interviewed several Jewish refugees. ""They went from certain death to this life."" Among them was Frank Ephraim, who arrived in Manila at the age of eight. He recounted his experience in his biography, ""Escape to Manila: From Nazi Tyranny to Japanese Terror."" ""My father got a lot of positive attention, coming from a place where Jews were exiled and treated so poorly,"" said his daughter, of his escape from Europe. Frank Ephraim died in 2006. ""The Filipinos were incredibly kind and treated him extremely well. There was an element of something so redemptive."" Manuel Quezon, the first president of the Philippine Commonwealth, and a group of Americans that included future U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower and the Freiders, the Jewish-American brothers, became increasingly concerned about the treatment of Jews in Europe during the late 1930s. ""They had a shared view of the world, they were men who understood what was happening in Europe,"" said Russ Hodge, co-producer of the documentary ""Rescue in the Philippines."" That documentary was screened in the Philippines with the country's president, Benigno Aquino in attendance last year. Over poker, the men devised a strategy to bring Jewish refugees to the Philippines. The Philippines Commonwealth remained under U.S. supervision so it could not accept people who would need public assistance. The refuge committee sought highly skilled professionals such as doctors, mechanics and accountants. By 1938, a stream of refugees arrived including a rabbi, doctors, chemists and even a conductor, Herbert Zipper, who survived Dachau concentration camp and later became the founder of the Manila Symphony. Quezon's ambitions to settle 10,000 Jews in the southern island of Mindanao were dashed as the the war arrived to the shores of the Philippines. For the European Jews who arrived in the Philippines, ""it was a cultural shock,"" said Hershfield. ""We didn't know the language. We had never seen any other than white people before."" The humidity was thick, the heat overpowering and the mosquitoes gigantic. But the young Jewish refugees saw the Philippines as a new adventure. Children climbed mango trees, swam in the bay and learned Filipino songs. Hershfield became friends with local neighbors, played sipa (a local kicking game) and relished tropical fruit such as papaya and guava. Life in Manila was running around in sandals and summer clothes. The experience differed for her parents. ""It was very difficult for my parents,"" she said. ""They never really learned Tagalog. They had been westernized and they stayed mostly within their circle of other immigrants."" Many of them lived in crowded community housing where fights would break out. They had gone from being wealthy in Germany to having nothing. ""It wasn't what they'd known before in Germany,"" Izon said. ""At the same time, ""they were able to practice their religion, able to intermingle and have businesses."" Hershfield's idyllic days of playing under the Manila sun came to an abrupt end as the war came ashore to the Philippines. Starting in 1941, the Japanese occupied the Philippines. In some respects, the Jewish refugees were treated considerably better than Filipinos. What ironically protected the Jews was their German passports with the swastikas -- they were viewed as allies. ""It occurred to me later, that's what kept us from being interned,"" said Ursula Miodowski, who was 7 years old at the time. The Japanese interned British and American residents in camps. Filipinos and American soldiers were forced to march 65 miles in the infamous Bataan Death March in which an estimated 10,000 prisoners died. Japanese officers confiscated residents' homes and also hoarded crops for its military. The local economy shriveled and food became scarce. Life under the Japanese was hard and brutal, surviving refugees said. When Allied forces began taking back the Philippines, bombs fell daily. Families hid in bomb shelters, not knowing where the next one would fall. Frank Ephraim spent days hiding in a ditch, shaking with a mattress covering his head. One of Hershfield's friends died after stepping on a mine. ""Fires were going on all the time,"" said Hershfield. ""You could see the black clouds, smell of bodies, lying there and decaying."" As the Japanese were losing Manila, the imperial troops launched a brutal urban campaign. Rapes, torture, beheadings and bayoneting of civilians were widely reported, so much so that a Japanese general Tomoyuki Yamashita was later executed for having failed to control his troops. ""The Japanese decided to destroy Manila. They were going to give them a dead city, they set about doing that,"" said Miodowski. ""They burned, they killed."" But war time in the Philippines was ""preferable to being in a concentration camp,"" she said. The monthlong urban street fighting for Manila left the capital in ashes, decimating its economy and infrastructure. The Philippines suffered nearly a million civilian deaths during the war. Despite the trauma of facing both fronts of the war, Hershfield remains grateful. ""We would not be alive today if not for the Philippines. We would've been destroyed in the crematorium."" In 2009, a monument honoring the Philippines was erected at the Holocaust Memorial Park in the Israeli city of Rishon Lezion. The monument, shaped like three open doors, thanks the Filipino people and its president for taking in Jewish refugees during the Holocaust. Many of the descendants of the Jewish refugees who fled to the Philippines have not forgotten their family's place of refuge. When Typhoon Haiyan struck the Philippines in November 2013, the disaster brought in relief workers from the American Jewish Distribution Committee. Danny Pins, who is related to Hershfield and is the son of a Jewish refugee to the Philippines, headed its assessment team. ""For me it was like coming full circle and I couldn't help but think of what it must have been like when my grandparents and mother arrived 76 years ago,"" he said. ""My going to the Philippines after Typhoon Haiyan was very special. I was repaying a debt to the country that saved my family.""","Philippines welcomed Jewish refugees during Holocaust while other countries closed doors .

"The trial of the son of former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and dozens of other former regime officials resumed in Tripoli on Sunday, in continued defiance of the International Criminal Court that last week rejected Libya's plea to try Saif al-Islam Gadhafi domestically. Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, once his father's heir apparent, has been held in the western mountain city of Zintan by the militiamen who captured him in 2011. The group has refused to hand him over to the central government, citing security concerns and lawlessness in the capital. He appeared via videolink from a courthouse in Zintan, while more than 20 former officials were in the south Tripoli courtroom. Eight other former regime members being held in Misrata also appeared on a videolink. The officials are facing charges relating to the 2011 revolution and attempts to suppress the uprising, including the killing of protesters, a crime punishable by death. The fourth session of the trial comes less than a week after the ICC's appeals chamber upheld an earlier decision by the international court demanding that Libya hand over Gadhafi to The Hague. Libya submitted put in a legal request to try Gadhafi domestically in 2012, but it was rejected by the ICC last year and later appealed by the North African country. Wednesday's decision by the ICC appeals chamber is a final. The ICC had indicted both Gadhafi and former spy chief Abdullah al-Senussi for alleged war crimes in 2011. Al-Senussi, who was extradited to Libya from Mauritania two years ago, also appeared in court on Sunday, looking frail and as if he had lost weight. Although the international court granted Libya the right to try al-Senussi last year, his ICC- appointed lawyer was appealing the ruling. Libya has insisted that unlike under the Gadhafi regime, the defendants will receive a fair trial. But rights groups have raised concerns about the ongoing trial, especially the use of videolink that they say does not allow them to communicate with their lawyers before and during sessions. Other concerns include limited access of some defendants to legal counsel, and some defendants still have no lawyers. During Sunday's session Gadhafi still did not have a court-appointed lawyer, and al-Senussi's attorney was absent. Without the presence of defense lawyers, the two did not enter a plea or respond to charges read by the judge. The other defendants denied the charges. Some of them became emotional as they addressed the court. Buzeid Dorda, the former head of foreign intelligence, denied the charges calling them ""fabricated"" and ""politically motivated."" The trial was adjourned to June 22 after the prosecution and defense attorneys requested more time to prepare their cases. Libya's government, which has been in the midst of its worst political and security crisis since the revolution, has not yet commented on the ICC's latest decision. Legal experts say the country could face consequences for its refusal to hand over Gadhafi to The Hague, but only if steps are taken by the international community. ""Sanctions can be imposed on Libya by the UN Security Council for Libya's non-compliance, and Libya's membership in various international organizations could be suspended and/or made conditional on Libya surrendering Saif Gadhafi to the ICC, if states wish to insist on it,"" John Jones, Gadhafi's ICC-appointed defense lawyer, told CNN on Saturday. ""Therefore the matter is in the hands of the international community, in particular states like the UK and France, which are both members of the ICC and permanent members of the Security Council."" Jones insisted that Libya must hand Gadhafi over to the ICC, saying his rights have been ""gravely violated"" since his capture more than two years ago. Violations include Gadhafi being held in solitary confinement in a secret location and being denied visits by friends and family, according to Jones. ""Libya is paralyzed and unable to protect the rights and security of Libyans, including judges, lawyers and judicial police and detainees, much less the rights of a person like Mr. Gadhafi,"" Jones said. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, who have also raised concerns about the deteriorating security situation in the country, have also renewed their call for Libya to hand over Saif al-Islam to The Hague. ""The ICC appeals decision only reinforces Libya's long overdue obligation to surrender Saif Gadhafi to The Hague,"" said Richard Dicker, international justice director. ""Libyan authorities should show the same respect for ICC procedures as they did when they first engaged the court on Gadhafi's case."" Crowds rally in Libya to support retired general's campaign .

"President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin crossed paths Tuesday during a summit of world leaders in China -- but little else. The world leaders registered just a few chats during the daylong Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meetings in Beijing despite both flanking Chinese President Xi Jinping throughout most of the event. National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan confirmed the brief encounters between Obama and Putin in a statement Tuesday. ""On three occasions throughout the day, for a total of approximately 15-20 minutes, President Obama had an opportunity to speak with President Putin,"" Meehan said. ""Their conversations covered Iran, Syria, and Ukraine."" Those likely won't be the only conversations between the two presidents as they are expected to cross paths again during the G20 summit in Australia later this week. Obama will also travel to Myanmar during his weeklong trip across Asia and the Pacific. U.S.-Russia Relations have descended to a new low over the last eight months since Russia meddled in the internal affairs of Ukraine, a NATO ally, and annexed Crimea in March. Chinese censors wipe Putin's move on China's first lady . That annexation compelled the United States and the European Union to begin imposing sanctions on Russia which have since ratcheted up following Russia's continued support of pro-Russian separatists fighting Ukrainian forces in Eastern Ukraine. And those tensions came to a head this summer with the downing of flight MH17, which U.S. officials have said was shot down by a Russian-made missile from rebel-held territory in Eastern Ukraine. Western sanctions have targeted Putin's inner circle in an attempt to pressure the Russian head of state to change his tack. Russia has not only armed the separatists in the region, but has reportedly deployed Russian military personnel to Eastern Ukraine -- with Ukraine accusing Russia most recently of sending 32 tanks across its border on Friday. And despite attempts to ""reset"" U.S.-Russia relations early on in Obama's presidency, relations between the two countries have soured over more than just Ukraine. The two countries have also been at odds over the conflict in Syria as Putin continues to arm Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces and provide diplomatic cover for Iran over its nuclear ambitions.

"Russian tanks, Russian artillery, Russian air defense systems and Russian troops -- all heading into Ukraine. That's what American Gen. Phillip Breedlove, the commander of NATO forces in Europe, said Wednesday that his government has seen over the past few days -- Moscow's latest such alleged incursion into the nation, parts of which remain in turmoil after months of violence. Russian officials frequently deny claims that the military has moved into disputed parts of the Ukraine, and this time is no exception. In a report from the country's state-run TASS news agency, Russian military spokesman Igor Konashenkov blasted what he called Breedlove's ""alarmist anti-Russian allegations."" ""We've stressed many a time there are no real facts behind the acts of shaking the air by Brussels officials,"" Konashenkov said, referring to the Belgian capital, where NATO is based. Ukraine violence flares as ceasefire collapses . A day earlier, Breedlove said Russia has moved ""forces that are capable of being nuclear"" into Crimea, which was Ukrainian territory until being folded into Russia on the heels of a government turnover earlier this year. Crimea borders southeastern Ukraine, where much of the current unrest is focused and into which Russian troops allegedly have moved. ""Whether they are [nuclear-equipped] or not, we don't know,"" Breedlove, the top U.S. general in Europe, said Tuesday. ""But they do have the kind of equipment there that could support that mission if required."" Russian President Vladimir Putin has alluded to his country's nuclear arsenal, amid criticism of Russia's actions. In late August, state-run TASS reported that he told a youth forum, ""I want to remind you that Russia is one of the most powerful nuclear nations. This is a reality, not just words."" Asked specifically about possible nuclear movement into Crimea, Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, ""NATO releases such statements almost on a daily basis. We have no intention to react and comment on them."" Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu did say Wednesday that his military is considering forming ""a full-fledged and self-sufficient"" unit in Crimea. Those troops' purpose would be ""to ensure the military security of the country and its allies,"" said Shoigu, according to another TASS report. ""In many respects, this is connected with the situation in Ukraine, with fomentation of anti-Russian moods on the part of NATO and reinforcement of foreign military presence in the immediate vicinity to our borders,"" the defense minister said. Opinion: Ukraine or Russia -- who will blink first? The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting Wednesday afternoon on the worsening situation, where one official warned of a return to serious fighting. ""We are deeply concerned over the possibility of a return to full-scale fighting,"" Jens Anders Toyberg-Frandzen, U.N. assistant secretary-general for political affairs, told the Security Council. The alternative to all-out war, still a ""catastrophe for Ukraine,"" would be months of continuing ""low-level battles marked by periods of increased hostilities and further casualties,"" Toyberg-Frandzen said. All these accusations and actions come amid intensified fighting of late in southeastern Ukraine. Pro-Russian rebels claim control of parts of that region, despite a push by Ukrainian forces to defeat them. The two sides signed a ceasefire deal in September, raising hope that the months-long conflict was nearing an end. But now, fighting has returned to levels that preceded the ceasefire, a British security source who has detailed knowledge of the matter told CNN. As Breedlove said Tuesday, ""The ceasefire is in name only at this point."" Ukrainian Defense Minister Stepan Poltorak said his government needs to be ready for combat operations, especially amid concerns that separatists and their Russian allies are building up their forces. Ukrainian defense spokesman Andriy Lysenko said late last week that 32 tanks, 16 D-30 howitzers and 30 KamAZ heavy trucks crossed from Russia past a border checkpoint and headed toward the volatile Luhansk region. Another Ukrainian official, Dmytro Tymchuk, alleged the ""armored column"" consisted of ""a battalion tactical group of the Russian Armed Forces,"" according to Ukrinform state news agency. Russia accused of sending 32 tanks into Ukraine . Talking at a government meeting Wednesday, Poltorak said that ""of course, we expect .... actions"" by those forces moving into and around southeastern Ukraine. He added, ""I think the main task is to prepare for fighting.""","Russian official: ""No real facts"" behind claims troops moved into Ukraine .

"Could this be the deadliest smartphone app ever? A German security consultant, who's also a commercial pilot, has demonstrated tools he says could be used to hijack an airplane remotely, using just an Android phone. Speaking at the Hack in the Box security summit in Amsterdam, Netherlands, Hugo Teso said Wednesday that he spent three years developing SIMON, a framework of malicious code that could be used to attack and exploit airline security software, and an Android app to run it that he calls PlaneSploit. Using a flight simulator, Teso showed off the ability to change the speed, altitude and direction of a virtual airplane by sending radio signals to its flight-management system. Current security systems don't have strong enough authentication methods to make sure the commands are coming from a legitimate source, he said. ""You can use this system to modify approximately everything related to the navigation of the plane,"" Teso told Forbes after his presentation. ""That includes a lot of nasty things."" He told the crowd that the tools also could be used to do things like change what's on a pilot's display screen or turn off the lights in the cockpit. With the Android app he created, he said, he could remotely control a plane by simply tapping preloaded commands like ""Please Go Here"" and the ominous ""Visit Ground."" The Federal Aviation Administration said it is aware of Teso's claims, but said the hacking technique does not pose a threat on real flights because it does not work on certified flight hardware. ""The described technique cannot engage or control the aircraft's autopilot system using the (Flight Management System) or prevent a pilot from overriding the autopilot,"" the FAA said. ""Therefore, a hacker cannot obtain 'full control of an aircraft' as the technology consultant has claimed."" Teso says he developed SIMON in a way that makes it work only in virtual environments, not on actual aircraft. But the risk is there, some experts say. ""His testing laboratory consists of a series of software and hardware products, but the connection and communication methods, as well as ways of exploitation, are absolutely the same as they would be in an actual real-world scenario,"" analysts at Help Net Security wrote in a blog post. Teso told the crowd that he used flight-management hardware that he bought on eBay and publicly available flight-simulator software that contains at least some of the same computer coding as real flight software. Analyst Graham Cluley of Sophos Security said it's unclear how devastating Teso's find would be if unleashed on an airplane in flight. ""No one else has had an opportunity to test this researcher's claims as he has, thankfully, kept secret details of the vulnerabilities he was able to exploit,"" Cluley said. ""We are also told that he has informed the relevant bodies, so steps can be taken to patch any security holes before someone with more malicious intent has an opportunity to exploit them."" Teso said at the summit that he's reached out to the companies that make the systems he exploited and that they were receptive to addressing his concerns. He also said he's contacted aviation safety officials in the United States and Europe. ""From the sound of things, this researcher has got himself a lot of media attention, but still believes in responsible disclosure, rather than potentially putting aircraft and passengers at risk,"" Cluley said. Teso isn't the first so-called ""white hat"" hacker to expose what appear to be holes in air-traffic security. Last year, at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas, computer scientist Andrei Costin discussed weaknesses he said he found in a new U.S. air-traffic security system set to roll out next year. The flaws he found weren't instantly catastrophic, he said, but could be used to track private airplanes, intercept messages and jam communications between planes and air-traffic control.","A German security researcher says he has developed an app that could hack planes .

"The QuikTrip that's now in shambles, its iconic red awning a nest of twisted metal, was once a favorite stop for residents here. The kids loved the slushies. The adults loved the doughnuts. And residents in the area say that before ""the ruckus on West Florissant"" -- in which looters and vandals parading as protesters mangled a primary corridor -- they could walk to QuikTrip at any hour with nary a concern for their safety. It speaks to a city that enjoys the simpler things: a frozen custard at an old train depot, an afternoon casting reels in Wabash Park, pork steak Wednesdays at Marley's Bar & Grill or a night knocking back cold ones at the local brew house. The Ferguson that residents see on television, they don't recognize that place. The tear gas canisters clanking through the streets, flash-bang grenades, military Humvees and cops in riot gear facing off with angry protesters, many of them out-of-town rabble-rousers here to cause trouble -- yeah, this isn't Ferguson, they say. Residents near the protest area have gotten the worst of it. Their stores' windows have been replaced with plywood, spray-painted with messages like, ""Thank you for your love and support."" Protest blockades have trapped them in the neighborhoods at night, leaving them afraid to take walks or let their children play out of sight. For some, staying inside was no better, as the pungent tear gas used to choke and disperse troublemakers -- and incidentally, peaceful but precariously positioned protesters -- wafted down into their neighborhood. It seeped into their homes, stinging their eyes, skin and throat. They moved here because of the city's solid schools, decent jobs, affordable housing and manageable crime rate. Now, they're choking in their living rooms. Three weeks ago, before Michael Brown was shot and killed by police officer Darren Wilson, Ferguson was an immensely different place, they said.

They just want to take care of the homes they have and keep it moving,"" said Charles Davis, a longtime black businessman in the area who opened his Ferguson Burger Bar on West Florissant the day before Brown was shot. Opening a burger shop across from a McDonald's on one of Ferguson's main drags may seem questionable, but like many people in the area, he said his fate is in someone else's hands. ""I have a good friend. His name is God. I don't worry about it,"" said Davis, who has lived in Ferguson three years; his mom has lived here for 20. In the nights after Brown's shooting -- when most businesses closed either intentionally or as a result of having their windows smashed and wares filched -- he stayed open until 10 or 11 p.m., serving up his ""garbage"" burgers, complete with bacon and a fried egg, and Muddy Water, a secret-recipe beverage resembling an Arnold Palmer (but don't tell Davis that). When tear gas canisters bounced into his parking lot, which he shares with a barbershop and beauty supply store, he opened his doors to protesters. Inside the bare-bones eatery with its pithy signs -- ""You say I dream too big, I say you think too small"" -- refugees watched through hand-painted plate glass as the mayhem unfolded outside. Ferguson residents aren't used to being fearful. FBI statistics from 2012 show crime is a smidge higher than the national average, but it's low for St. Louis, especially if you venture to the nearby suburbs of Kinloch, Berkeley, Jennings and the misleadingly named Country Club Hills. In many parts of the city, blacks live next to whites, whites live next to blacks, and everyone seems to get along. At least they did before the town was overrun with strangers and it became unclear who was supporting Michael Brown and who sought to stoke chaos. ""From what I understand and know, Ferguson is A-OK,"" said Davis, who lives in a diverse neighborhood down the street from his burger joint. A rift with police . Sure, there are exceptions: the nosy lady down the street always concerned with someone else's business or the shopkeeper who seems to watch his black patrons too closely. And then there are the guys with badges. You'll hear stories about them if you travel to some of the predominantly black neighborhoods: the nondescript block units of Nantucket Gardens or the oak-laden Park Ridge Apartments. And, of course, there's the sprawling 400-unit Canfield Green development with its three-story, brick-and-siding dwellings recently refurbished with new wooden handrails and staircases. There, the police have a reputation for being tough, and while that's good for keeping the drug dealers and gangbangers who plague St. Louis off Ferguson's streets, many innocent black teens and young men are swept up in the effort to keep Ferguson safe, residents said. Older African-Americans seem less affected, but they have stories about nephews, sons or family friends being roughed up or dressed down in this city of 21,000. Patricia Pendelton, a nurse who lives a few blocks from the cross-and-candle memorial that marks the spot where Brown took his last step, said she has never had issues with police, but she noted that she's a 41-year-old woman. As youngsters, their elementary school closed because of the protests, rambled through her front yard and played basketball on a miniature hoop, she explained how her sons -- ages 17, 19 and 21 -- have different experiences. They and other young black men have been stopped for reasons as spurious as looking suspicious, she said. ""How does a person look suspicious? What do you have to be wearing to look suspicious?"" she asked before mimicking an offending police officer, "" 'Where you going? What you doing? How you doing it?' It's none of your business."" Outside his bustling barbershop on a muggy Missouri afternoon, Mike Knox, his ears tucked under a spiffy St. Louis Cardinals snapback, recalled how one of his sons, an A student, was arrested with several other kids in the parking lot of an auto parts store. They'd met there because it was a central location to rendezvous before a game of basketball. When Knox picked his son up, police told him he hadn't been charged, just taken away by police, said Knox, adding that he's been pulled over for DWB, or ""driving while black,"" a common complaint in Ferguson. At a protest in a parking lot across from the police station, Maurice Phipps, 22, a Ferguson resident of eight years, relayed a similar story: A Ferguson officer once pulled him over and said he was looking for a suspect with dreadlocks. ""And I got a box cut,"" he said, pointing to his dyed-blond 'do. It's not just blacks complaining. Tom Steigerwald, 31, a military brat who moved to Ferguson in 1994, recalled being smacked in the head by a Ferguson cop after an argument over a noise complaint. ""They've always been a**holes,"" he said. ""They all got a power trip problem, a lot of them."" It's this kind of police behavior that creates rifts in the community, said Knox, a 33-year-old father of four. ""You're supposed to be happy when you see police. That's a protector. But no, not really,"" he said. Many changing faces . Ferguson used to be a hiccup of a town hosting a train depot between St. Louis and St. Charles. It popped up in 1894 on a few deeded acres. In its first census, it boasted 1,000 residents. A century will bring change to any city, but the times have frequently altered the face of Ferguson. It has been a commuter stop, a bedroom community for the automotive and airline industries and now, with 40% of its population younger than 25, a hub for students. Another change? Twenty-five years ago, one in four residents was black. Today, the number is two of three. Yet despite that shift, two things have remained static: Ferguson's police force and the Ferguson City Council are overwhelmingly white. The old depot is now an eatery and museum, next to a train trellis that sports banners promoting church fish fries and the local farmers market, one of the state's most popular. On Saturdays, about 50 volunteers set up tents and tables, as area residents arrive to buy plump tomatoes and sweet corn from growers such as Earth Dance Farms down the street. Also nearby is Pearce Neikirk's handsomely appointed real estate office with fiber art from local artists adorning the walls. Located between a bike shop and wine bar on a 10-block stretch of downtown known as CityWalk, the area features concert series, festivals and Food Truck Mondays. West of CityWalk you'll find dozens of ""century homes,"" architecturally distinct Colonial, Craftsman and Tudor Revival structures with sweeping roofs, gables and expansive porches. Residents mail-ordered them from Sears and Montgomery Ward during the early 1900s . ""This is the kind of stuff that makes the community really strong. It makes it attractive,"" Neikirk said. But be clear: While this part of Ferguson has a diverse mix of residents traversing its streets, its historic buildings and well-kept landscaping are a contrast from the strip malls and $500-a-month apartments along West Florissant. Aside from broken windows at a liquor store and brake shop and a few other acts of vandalism, this side of town has remained relatively unscathed during the protests, perhaps because of the downtown police station. Or maybe because it's a mile from where Michael Brown lost his life. Whatever the reason, the residents along West Florissant yearn for a return to the normalcy that is still day-to-day life on the other side of town. They may get it. Thursday's and Friday's protests were some of the most peaceful yet. Some black residents, though, are skeptical it can stay that way, especially if Darren Wilson isn't indicted. ""If this police officer don't get no kind of charge,"" said the nurse, Pendelton, shaking her head at the potentiality, ""they think it's chaos now?""","Ferguson yearns for more ""normal"" days .
Shooting and protests have changed the town .

"South Sudan's president, who accused Sudan of declaring war on his nation, cut short his trip to China on Wednesday as tension between the two neighbors intensified over border and oil disputes. President Salva Kiir canceled the Shanghai leg of his trip. He had planned a five-day trip, ending Saturday. It's unclear how soon he will return home. During a visit to Beijing on Tuesday, Kiir  accused Sudan of declaring war on his nation. The visit came at a ""critical moment ... because our neighbor in Khartoum has declared war"" on South Sudan, Kiir told his Chinese counterpart,  Hu Jintao. His accusation marked the latest in fiery war rhetoric that has drawn alarm and condemnation from the international community. China, a crucial trading ally to both nations, urged restraint and negotiation, and said it plans to send its envoy for Africa to Sudan and South Sudan to promote peace talks. Beijing has deep trade ties with Africa, and has had diplomatic and economic ties with Sudan for decades.  Ambassador Zhong Jianhua traveled to both countries earlier this year for mediation, the  Chinese foreign ministry said. South Sudan split from Sudan last year as part of a 2005 peace deal that ended decades of war in Africa's largest nation. The war left 2 million people dead and ended with the peace agreement that included an independence referendum for the south. Despite the split in July,  unresolved issues remain between the two, including status of their citizens, division of national debt, disputed border areas and sharing of oil wealth. Simmering tensions peaked this month when South Sudan seized the oil-producing region of Heglig from Sudan, raising the stakes by targeting a resource that fuels the economies of both nations. Heglig oil facilities account for about half of Sudan's production of 115,000 barrels a day. Sudan claims ownership for the region, and lodged complaints with the United Nations and the African Union to pressure South Sudan to withdraw troops from its territory. The  African Union on Tuesday gave the nations 48 hours to cease their hostilities and three months to complete negotiations on outstanding issues or face ""appropriate measures."" It said it will seek updates on the status of negotiations and will require compliance by Sudan and South Sudan. Failure to resolve their disputes will lead to an arbitration process, the body said, without getting into specifics. Heglig is on the border created when the two countries split. While it is a disputed region, Sudan continued administering it after South Sudan declared independence from the north. ""We have every right to use all military means inside our territory to crush the enemy, "" said Daffa-Alla Ali Osman, Sudan's ambassador to the United Nations. ""Setting territories inside our borders as theirs ... this is a call for war until they stop and refrain from any behavior against the territorial integrity of Sudan."" After an international outcry, including from U.S. President  Barack Obama, who urged the nations to resolve their issues peacefully, South Sudan withdrew its troops Saturday and Sudan retook control of Heglig. ""We wish to see a return to peace with our neighbors. We stand by the values of having two states viable and living in peace side by side,"" said Agnes Oswaha, the South Sudan ambassador to the United Nations. A day after South Sudan withdrew from the disputed region, it accused Sudan of launching ground and aerial attacks on its territory. The bombing in Unity state killed at least 16 and left 34 injured, the United Nations said. U.N. peacekeeping officials in South Sudan confirmed the casualties from bombings near the border, said Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and the current Security Council president. Council members have ""demanded an immediate halt to aerial bombardment by the Sudanese armed forces and urged an immediate cease-fire and return to the negotiating table,"" she said Tuesday. A spokesman for the Sudanese military could not be immediately reached for comment. Claims from both sides are difficult to confirm because journalists and independent observers do not have access to the front lines. The international community has appealed for both sides to silence their weapons and return to the negotiating table, with Sudan facing the latest criticism for bombing Bentiu, which is about 60 miles (nearly 100 kilometers) from Heglig. Last week, Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir vowed to never give up the disputed region, whose  loss would send the nation's economy reeling. Sudan's oil industry suffered when fighting in Heglig halted oil production in those fields. The Satellite Sentinel Project released images this week suggesting a critical part of the oil pipeline infrastructure was destroyed. The collection manifold, which allows oil flows to be separated or combined without interrupting the flow, appears to have been damaged by an explosion. Analysts could not determine whether the destruction was the result of ground fighting or aerial bombardment,  said Jonathan Hutson, a spokesman for the project, which is led by the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative. Serious damage to the facility would prevent companies from resuming production and would require substantial investment to repair or rebuild.","South Sudan's president cancels the Shanghai leg of his China trip .

"First, police say, came a fight in a crowd at the end of a multiday surfing and skateboarding competition in Southern California's Huntington Beach on Sunday evening. Then came a riot, with scores of people rampaging down palm tree-lined streets, damaging city vehicles and street signs, throwing more punches and overturning portable toilets as many more looked on. By the time helmeted police broke up the disturbance hours later -- firing pepper-spray pellets in the process -- at least eight people had been arrested on suspicion of failing to disperse, the Huntington Beach Police Department said. World's 50 best surf spots . The rampage came as people left the U.S. Open of Surfing, a nine-day event that wrapped up Sunday afternoon. No injuries were reported. ""It started with like a fight, and then it just broke out,"" an unidentified woman told CNN affiliate KTLA. ""They were tipping Porta Potties. Then the cops started to move in, and they were throwing tear gas at everyone. ""Everyone was like plugging their nose and coughing and dodging into stores. Everyone was just running down Main Street."" In a cell phone video obtained by CNN, men topple portable toilets as others jump and cheer, and still others look on and record video. Another clip shows two people exchanging punches while surrounded by scores of onlookers. Rioters damaged city vehicles, windows, newspaper racks and street signs, police said. Authorities said they hadn't yet accounted for all the damage. The competition's organizers are ""extremely disappointed and saddened by the disturbance,"" a message on the U.S. Open of Surfing's Facebook page said.

"(CNN)Indonesian searchers battled bad weather Wednesday in their efforts to find more remains from AirAsia Flight QZ8501, a day after the first signs of debris were spotted. There was conflicting information about whether any parts of the plane had been located underwater. One search official told CNN that he believes sonar equipment has detected wreckage from the plane at the bottom of the sea. ""I think that that's the case,"" said Muhammad Hernanto, the head of search and rescue for the city of Surabaya, where Flight 8501 began its journey on Sunday. He was dialing back earlier comments he made to CNN in which he said the sonar equipment had located wreckage from the plane. Indonesia's national search and rescue chief said the body of the aircraft hasn't yet been discovered. ""Until now, we haven't found the plane,"" Bambang Soelistyo said, according to Indonesia's national news agency Antara. ""We've only found seven bodies to this day."" The grim discovery Tuesday of parts of the missing plane and several bodies on the surface of the sea dealt a heartbreaking blow to families whose loved ones were lost. Debris was found 100-200 kilometers (60-120 miles) from the aircraft's last known location over the Java Sea, Indonesia's search and rescue agency said. Seven bodies -- four men and three women -- have been recovered from the water so far, Soelistyo said. One of the women found was wearing a flight attendant's uniform, he said. Search teams are looking for other bodies and parts of the plane, including its so-called black boxes. Those could help investigators determine what went wrong on the flight, which lost contact with air traffic controllers on Sunday with 162 people aboard. Sonar equipment has been searching the bottom of the sea, tens of meters below the water's surface, according to SB Supriyadi, the search agency's director of operations. Dozens of ambulances were lined up in the Indonesian city of Surabaya, ready to carry any bodies recovered. The search isn't easy; heavy wind and rain, as well as big waves, are hampering efforts, officials said. Families' anguish . As families watched a live news conference Tuesday about the discovery of the debris and saw video of a helicopter lowering a diver to what appeared to be a floating body, some people fainted. Stretchers were brought into the room. Family members burst into tears, dabbing their eyes as officials passed out tissues. Some sat with their eyes full of tears, hands covering their mouths or heads buried in their hands. Others had phones jammed against their ears. ""Everyone became hysterical, especially the mothers. One mother even blacked out,"" said Maria Endang Wirasmi, whose daughter, son-in-law and two grandchildren were on the flight. Her husband, Imam Sampurno, said he was relieved the plane had been found. ""We hope that our children will be saved by a miracle,"" he said. AirAsia CEO Tony Fernandes told reporters he hoped there was ""at least some closure"" for families. ""My heart is filled with sadness for all the families involved in QZ 8501,"" he tweeted. ""On behalf of AirAsia my condolences to all. Words cannot express how sorry I am."" Flight 8501 was operated by AirAsia's Indonesian affiliate. Military crew spotted an object's shadow . Soelistyo, the head of Indonesia's search and rescue agency, said the debris was discovered when a crew on a military aircraft spotted the shadow of an object that looked like a plane in the water off the coast of Indonesia's Central Kalimantan province on Borneo. Further searching found floating objects believed to be the bodies of passengers, and then what appeared to be an emergency exit of the plane. Officials sent other search teams racing to the area. Several nations are contributing resources to the effort, including the United States. The U.S. Navy destroyer USS Sampson arrived Tuesday. The USS Fort Worth is also being prepared to deploy from Singapore, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said.  It ""can be ready to sail in a day or two to get on station and can be there very quickly,"" he said. The United States is also preparing maritime patrol aircraft that could help, he said. The flight, which was lost Sunday on its way to Singapore, was carrying 155 passengers and seven crew members. The overwhelming majority were Indonesians. There were also citizens of Britain, France, Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea. Search and rescue teams are diverting all their resources to where the debris is, in the Karimata Strait, about 110 nautical miles southwest of the Indonesian city of Pangkalan Bun, AirAsia said. How can a modern airliner vanish? Unanswered questions . Fernandes said the focus for now must remain on the recovery effort, and no sweeping changes were planned for the airline, which has 1,000 flights a day. ""But rest assured,"" he said, that once the investigation is done, if ""there are things we need to change, that we will change it."" The Airbus A320-200 lost contact with air traffic control early Sunday shortly after the pilot requested permission to turn and climb to a higher altitude because of bad weather, according to Indonesian officials. Authorities mounted a huge effort to find the aircraft, mapping out a search zone covering 156,000 square kilometers. Questions remain about why Flight 8501 lost contact with air traffic control and what happened afterward. Some experts have said the aircraft might have experienced an aerodynamic stall because of a lack of speed or from flying at too sharp an angle to get enough lift. Analysts have also suggested the pilots might not have been getting information from onboard systems about the plane's position or that rain or hail from thunderstorms in the area could have damaged the engines. The key to understanding what happened is likely to be contained in the aircraft's flight recorders. ""Until we get the black boxes, we won't know what's going on with the engines,"" said Bill Savage, a former pilot with 30 years of experience. Anguish revisited: Relatives of MH370 victims speak out about AirAsia QZ8501 .

"The staffing search for a Hillary Clinton campaign manager is heating up, and a Clinton spokesman acknowledged  Thursday that the former secretary of state is ""casting a wide net"" when talking to different people about about a would-be presidential bid. Clinton met with Guy Cecil, the outgoing head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, on Wednesday in Washington, according to Politico, and has talked with Robby Mook, a former Clinton aide, about 2016.â€‹ Both are seen as frontrunner for the top job in a Clinton campaign. Although Clinton's spokesman said he wouldn't confirm or deny the meeting and conversations occurred, Nick Merrill acknowledged that Clinton is talking with a wide array of people about 2016. ""As she decides, she's casting a wide net and wants to hear from a variety of people on a range of specific topics, from policy ideas to what a successful campaign would look like,""  Merrill said in an email. Democrats have repeatedly said that Clinton has yet to make up her mind, but according to people close to Clinton, there have long been four names in the campaign manager race: Cecil, Mook, Stephanie Schriock and Ace Smith. Here is what you need to know about each. Cecil: . Although Cecil, as executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, was at the helm when Democrats lost the Senate in 2014, he is close with the Clintons -- particularly Bill Clinton -- and worked as Hillary Clinton's national political and field director in 2008. Cecil is an unpretentious figure and has won the trust of many on Capitol Hill. Earlier in his career he led the standard journeyman campaign life, working for campaigns in Arkansas, North Carolina and Colorado (where he led Sen. Michael Bennet's dark-horse win in 2010). Cecil has been hesitant to talk about Clinton publicly as she considers a 2016 run and did not respond to an email for this story. Mook: . The then 33-year-old political operative was seen as a man on the rise when he steered Gov. Terry McAuliffe to victory in Virginia in 2013 and is regularly mentioned by people close to Clinton as a smart choice for campaign manager. Before working for McAuliffe, Mook was the head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and in 2008 steered the Clinton presidential campaign to wins in Nevada, Ohio and Indiana. Mook, who has a loyal following in his own Democratic circle, started his political career working for then Gov. Howard Dean in Vermont. Like Cecil, Mook has been hesitant to comment publicly on Clinton's 2016 bid. He did, however, make the most interesting splash of any of the possible campaign managers when emails he sent to a group of supporters were leaked to ABC. In the emails, which were sent to a group called the ""Mook Mafia,"" the operative urged his supporters to ""smite Republicans mafia-style."" Schriock: . Schriock currently has what she calls ""one of the very best jobs in American politics right now"" and it wouldn't be a stretch to say Hillary Clinton probably agrees. As head of Emily's List, Schriock's goal is to help elect pro-choice, Democratic women across the country -- something Clinton regularly talks about on the stump. Schriock, the often-on-message campaign veteran, started her career as Dean's 2004 finance director, where she tapped into a new revenue stream -- the internet -- to raise money. She then went on to lead high profile Senate campaigns, including Jon Tester's in Montana and Al Franken's in Minnesota, to wins. Schriock briefed the press at last month's Ready for Hillary strategy session, where she flatly said she was ""not going to talk about"" a possible role in the Clinton campaign. ""I am not going to talk about any conversation I may or may not be having with any candidate who may or may not be running for office,"" she said. Smith: . Smith, a California based consultant with deep ties to the Clinton, would be the dark horse in this field of four. While Smith led Hillary Clinton's campaign to 2008 wins in California, Texas and North Carolina, it is the list of other Democrats he has worked for that is impressive: Richard Daley, Paul Simon, Ann Richards, Dianne Feinstein, Dick Gephardt and Howard Dean, to name a few. People close to Clinton say that Smith would be a good, outside-the-beltway choice for campaign manager. Although he had deep ties to Washington -- through the people he has worked for -- Smith is based in California and has focused on the state in the last few years. And it seems like Smith is interested. ""Anything Hillary Clinton asks me to do, I will do,"" Smith told the San Francisco Chronicle in November. ""I'm a huge charter member of the Hillary Clinton fan club.""","Hillary Clinton is reportedly meeting with candidates to be her 2016 campaign manager .

"(CNN)Rescuers rushed from the rubble with babies in their arms after a gas explosion leveled part of a maternity hospital in Mexico City on Thursday, killing at least three people and injuring dozens more. More than 100 people were inside Cuajimalpa Maternal Hospital when the blast occurred at about 7 a.m., minutes after a hose burst on a truck supplying gas to the building. Paramedics carried bloodied victims on stretchers. Ivonne Lugo Durantes told CNNMexico she spent 10 minutes trapped under rubble before rescuers reached her. The supervising nurse called her husband, Mario Angeles Sanchez, after the blast. As she described what was happening, he heard people in the background screaming for help. ""I am still a little bit in shock. It was a nightmare,"" she said, describing how hospital workers tried to rescue babies from a nursery as flames engulfed the building. A nurse and two babies were killed by the blast, Mexico City Health Secretary Armando Ahued told CNN affiliate FOROtv. At least 73 people were injured, he said, including about 20 newborns. Officials initially reported a higher death toll, but later said a mix-up between the number of those deceased and those seriously injured led to an incorrect report. Outside the hospital, frantic family members searched for word of loved ones they feared were inside. Searching continued Thursday evening at the site, though officials said it appeared everyone had been accounted for. Jose Eduardo was relieved to learn his wife and son, who was born on Wednesday, had survived the blast. He heard about the explosion on the news from his home, where he'd gone to rest after the baby was born. He rushed to the hospital to be by his wife's side. ""She told me that it started to smell like gas and the ceiling started to fall on everyone,"" he told CNNMexico. ""She covered up the baby and ran."" His wife was barefoot when she escaped, he said. Others were naked. ""We started pulling babies from the debris who were alive,"" Ignacio, a volunteer at the scene, told CNN. ""We pulled out, fortunately, I think we pulled out seven. We would've wanted to pull out more."" Witnesses said the explosion shook the neighborhood. ""We heard something, and it smelled so much like gas, really a lot. And then two minutes, three seconds later, we saw an explosion that made everything fly in the air,"" witness Teresa Ramirez told CNNMexico. ""It threw me to the ground."" Virginia Gonzalez, who lives near the hospital, said her patio was covered with broken glass from blown-out windows. After the explosion, Mexicans eager to help lined up at hospitals where victims were being treated, offering to donate blood and bringing bottled water and diapers for survivors. Lugo, the nurse who was inside the hospital during the explosion, told CNNMexico she is suffering from first-degree burns but feels lucky to be alive. ""I feel grateful to have another chance to keep living,"" she said, ""to keep working as a nurse."" First, calls came into firefighters reporting a gas leak at the hospital, a facility on the southwest outskirts of Mexico City that is part of the government health system. Hospital workers had already started evacuating the building when the explosion happened minutes later,  Mayor Miguel Angel Mancera told reporters. One of the city's publicly accessible webcams captured the blast, showing a plume of smoke rising from the direction of the hospital. A truck was supplying gas to the hospital when apparently a hose burst and the resulting leak caused an explosion, Mancera said. The driver and two assistants delivering the gas have been detained, Mancera's office told CNNMexico. Two of the detained workers are hospitalized, and one is receiving other medical care, the office said. The gas in question is known as liquefied petroleum gas, a mix that could be mostly propane or mostly butane. These propane/butane mixes are commonly used in Mexico for heating, cooking and other fuel applications. Gas Express Nieto, the company that owned the truck, has operated in Mexico City since 2007 and has a contract to supply gas to hospitals run by the Mexico City government, the mayor said. The hospital is 70% collapsed, Mancera said, although some walls and steel columns are still standing. Journalists James Fredrick and Sheila A. Sanchez Fermin and CNN's Krupskaia Alis and Fidel Gutierrez contributed to this report from Mexico City. CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin and Mayra Cuevas contributed from Atlanta.","Three men have been taken into custody in connection with the blast .

"Pro-democracy Hong Kongers have reacted angrily to a Chinese government white paper affirming Beijing's ""comprehensive jurisdiction"" over the territory, released days after more than 100,000 demonstrators gathered in the city calling for greater rights. The 14,500-word document, which stresses that Hong Kong does not have ""full autonomy"" and comes under Beijing's oversight, was released amid fierce debate between residents of the former British colony over impending electoral reform and the nature of the ""one country, two systems"" concept. Published by the State Council Information Office, the unprecedented white paper states that ""many wrong views are currently rife in Hong Kong"" with regard to the ""one country, two systems"" principle that governs the territory's relationship with Beijing. Some residents are ""confused or lopsided in their understanding"" of the principle, it adds. ""The high degree of autonomy of the HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) is not full autonomy, nor a decentralized power,"" said the paper. ""It is the power to run local affairs as authorized by the central leadership."" Hong Kong lawmaker Alan Leong, leader of the pro-democracy Civic Party, said he was ""completely taken aback"" by the document, which had sent a shiver up (his) spine."" ""It is a sea-change to our understanding of what 'one country, two systems' should be,"" he said. He argued that the notion that judicial decisions made in Hong Kong should take into account the needs of China was a new concept, and one that was ""totally repugnant to our understanding of the rule of law as an institution which we hold very dear to our hearts."" ""I am surprised that my country could go back on the promises and undertakings that had brought about such a smooth reversion to Chinese sovereignty,"" he said. A warning to democrats? Many analysts view the release of the paper, the first official document since the 1997 handover to set out Beijing's authority over the territory, as a warning to campaigners pushing for the introduction of universal suffrage by 2017, when the city will choose its next chief executive. Joseph Cheng, professor of political science at City University of Hong Kong, said the paper represented an attempt by Beijing to shape the debate around electoral reform. ""I think this is part of a campaign to warn Hong Kong people that we have to accept the electoral system soon to be imposed on us, which probably will follow the proposal set out by pro-Beijing groups,"" he said. An article of Hong Kong's Basic Law, which serves as the territory's constitution, states as an eventual goal that the chief executive should be selected through universal suffrage. In 2007, the Chinese government settled on 2017 as the earliest that this may occur. But the prospect has proven controversial, with pan-democrat Hong Kongers wanting the general population to be able to choose its next chief executive without restrictions, and the city's pro-Beijing politicians arguing that only candidates who ""love China"" should be eligible. Currently, Hong Kong's chief executive is chosen by a 1,200-member committee, mainly composed of pro-Beijing and business figures. Cheng said the white paper's main thrust was that, while Hong Kong enjoyed a high degree of autonomy, Beijing was ultimately in control, with China's interests and national security paramount. ""The main point is that whatever power Hong Kong has comes from the central government -- no more,"" he said. ""The emphasis is on China's state interests, China's sovereignty, on one country ahead of two systems."" Mixed opinions . Cheng said the paper had been met with ""concern, resentment, dissatisfaction."" ""We are all concerned that if Beijing chooses to deny giving Hong Kong people a democratic electoral system, then the SAR (special administrative region) government will be seen to be illegitimate."" But Mo Pak-hung, an associate professor at Hong Kong Baptist University's department of economics, did not see a cause for alarm, saying Beijing was sending a signal that it intended to be increasingly involved in Hong Kong's political evolution while supporting economic growth. ""It means that Hong Kong will be relatively stable politically and... (the) risk (to) the economy is reduced,"" he said. ""To the investors and businessmen in Hong Kong, these signals are positive."" Under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, Hong Kong has been allowed to develop as a more liberal, capitalist city within socialist China -- the only place within Chinese territory where large pro-democracy demonstrations are tolerated. Still, many of its residents are worried that the city's freedoms are steadily eroding, and Beijing's efforts to draw the territory nearer are often resisted. In February, journalists organized a 6,500-person rally decrying what they said were increasing levels of coercion against the Hong Kong press, and last week, as many as 180,000 people turned out to a candelight vigil commemorating the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, according to organizers. Occupy Central . Later this month, a pro-democracy group called Occupy Central plans to hold an unofficial citywide referendum asking Hong Kong's citizens to vote for their preferred type of electoral reform, a move that has irked the city's pro-Beijing establishment. If the results show support for public nomination and elections, Occupy Central says it will block traffic in Hong Kong's crowded downtown to pressure the government to adopt its reforms. A January poll by the non-partisan Hong Kong Transition Project found 38% of Hong Kongers supported Occupy Central's proposed civil disobedience, while 54% opposed it. China's vice president has warned that such a protest would be ""unlawful"" and would ""wreck the stability and prosperity"" of the city. On Friday, the South China Morning Post reported that Beijing was drafting a similar white paper on Macau -- the former Portuguese colony that is China's other Special Administrative Region. The newspaper quoted a researcher as saying the paper would cover similar ground to the Hong Kong report, and address public order issues in the wake of recent protests in the territory.

"As Congress voted on the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, in 2010, one of the bill's architects, MIT economist Jonathan Gruber, told a college audience that those pushing the legislation pitched it as a bill that would control spiraling health care costs even though most of the bill was focused on something else and there was no guarantee the bill would actually bend the cost curve. In recent days, the past comments of Gruber -- who in this 2010 speech notes that he ""helped write the federal bill"" and ""was a paid consultant to the Obama administration to help develop the technical details as well"" -- have been given renewed attention. In previously posted but recently noticed speeches, Gruber discusses how those pushing the bill took part in an ""exploitation of the lack of economic understanding of the American voter,"" taking advantage of voters' ""stupidity"" to create a law that would ultimately be good for them. In this fourth video, Gruber's language is not as stark as in three previous instances, but his suggestion that Obamacare proponents engaged in less-than-honest salesmanship remains. ""Barack Obama's not a stupid man, okay?"" Gruber said in his remarks at the College of the Holy Cross on March 11, 2010. ""He knew when he was running for president that quite frankly the American public doesn't actually care that much about the uninsured....What the American public cares about is costs. And that's why even though the bill that they made is 90% health insurance coverage and 10% about cost control, all you ever hear people talk about is cost control. How it's going to lower the cost of health care, that's all they talk about. Why? Because that's what people want to hear about because a majority of American care about health care costs."" You can watch the speech on the C-SPAN website here . Gruber said the measures in the bill that attempt to lower costs constitute a ""spaghetti approach"" -- throwing everything against the wall to see what sticks. And while preferable to the status quo, Gruber said he could offer no guarantee that any of the measures would work. ""The only way we're going to stop our country from being a latter day Roman Empire and falling under its own weight is getting control of the growth rate of health care costs,"" he said. ""The problem is we don't know how."" Experts ""know what the problem is,"" he said. ""Our providers are paid enormously high. In the 1950s surgeons are middle class guys like professors...Now they live on the Hamptons, the Cape, they're like investment bankers. Gruber said attempts to control costs in a real way were politically untenable. ""The problem is if we just say, 'Look, let's just cut our spending,' well, the problem is you're going to then eat into what the rich guys are getting that they're liking. And that doesn't go so well. That's going to be pretty hard politically. That's why no one has a politically feasible way right now to bend the cost curve, it just doesn't exist."" Politicians could suggest capping costs but ""you wouldn't win many elections."" The emergence of this videos from an important crafter of the legislation, repeatedly suggesting that ""stupid"" voters were misled for their own good by Obamacare supporters, is a potential political problem for the president. He now faces a Congress completely controlled by Republicans, determined to chip away at if not completely overturn the health care law. He also faces another U.S. Supreme Court case on the matter; Supreme Court Justices will assuredly be made aware of the Gruber comments one way or another. Asked about Gruber's comments from a 2013 University of Pennsylvania panel in which the economist said ""a lack of transparency was a huge political advantage for the President..."" in selling the bill to the American people, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said ""the process associated with writing and passing and implementing the Affordable Care Act has been extraordinarily transparent."" Earnest insisted ""it is Republicans who have been less than forthright and transparent about what their proposed changes to the Affordable Care Act would do in terms of the choices that are available to middle-class families.  I know there is at least one very prominent Republican who campaigned for reelection saying that he would repeal the Affordable Care Act, but yet keep in place the Affordable Care Act marketplace that has operated very successfully in his state."" Asked about Gruber's reference to the ""stupidity of the American voter,"" Earnest said, ""I disagree vigorously with that assessment."" Gruber declined to comment to CNN. Related: Third Obamacare architect video emerges . On Thursday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was asked about Gruber's remarks. ""I don't know who he is,"" she said. ""He didn't help write our bill."" A Washington Post story noted that Pelosi in 2009 cited Gruber's work approvingly. The Obama administration in recent days has suggested that efforts to bend the cost curve have been working. ""Since President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act, there is evidence that we have bent the cost curve when it comes to health care,"" the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, Sylvia Matthews Burwell, said in September. ""Across the board, we have now held down health care price inflation to the lowest rate in 50 years."" As Sophie Novack noted earlier this year in National Journal, the slowdown in the growth of health care costs is indeed ""promising, but analysts remain split over what accounts for the changeâ€”and, consequently, how long it will be sustained. The more pessimistic view is that the lower cost growth is a result of the recession and will inflate again as the economy recovers."" A 2013 Kaiser Foundation study concluded that the struggling economy was responsible for 77% of the slowed growth, ""that the economy, including factors such as Gross Domestic Product growth and inflation, produces a major but delayed effect on the nation's health spending. This effect stretches over a period of six years, meaning that the recession that ended in 2009 will continue to dampen health care spending for several more years and that spending will increase gradually as the economy strengthens."" At a press conference in 2010, President Obama told this reporter that ""bending the cost curve on health care is hard to do. I said at the time, it wasn't going to happen tomorrow, it wasn't going to happen next year. It took us decades to get into a position where our health care costs were going up 6, 7, 10 percent a year. And so our goal is to slowly bring down those costs,"" he said. Obama added, ""as a consequence of us getting 30 million additional people health care, at the margins, that's going to increase our costs, we knew that. We didn't think that we were going to cover 30 million people for free, but that the long-term trend in terms of how much the average family is going to be paying for health insurance is going to be improved as a consequence of health care."" The first few Gruber videos to get any media attention were documented over the course of the last year by Rich Weinstein, an investment adviser who became interested in the origins of the law after the price of insurance for his family doubled.","A series of videos featuring statements by an Obamacare architect have incited a furor among conservatives .
In the videos, MIT professor Jonathan Gruber suggested Obamacare supporters were over-emphasizing the benefits of the  health care law."
"(CNN)Another matchday, another morgue full of bodies; another crowd of mothers broken by grief, weeping for the souls of their dead sons. Soccer should never be about survival, it should never be about counting coffins, but Sunday was another dark night in Egypt. Around 20 fans of Zamalek were killed outside the Air Defence Stadium in Cairo before a top of the table clash with ENPPI. Egyptian officials announced that 19 people had been killed. Zamalek fans posted the pictures of corpses on social media. A crush had developed outside the narrow, single entrance -- more of a cage covered in barbed wire -- through which the thousands of fans were expected to walk through. As the fans tried to push their way in, it appeared that riot police fired tear gas into the crowd. Before the bodies were cold, the blame game had begun. Mortada Mansour, Zamalek's president, immediately blamed the Ultras White Knights (UWK) -- the club's organized group of fans -- and absolved the police of all blame. Egypt's interior ministry also blamed the fans, saying in a statement: ""They climbed the fence. The security forces tried to disperse them, the fans fled to the main road and blocked traffic and stopped the bus carrying the Zamalek soccer team. ""They set fire to a police vehicle. We got reports of fatalities because of a stampede."" We have heard this before, of course, and semantics are important. Were the young men -- for they are always young men -- killed? Was it a riot? Or was it naked violence? Was it an accident or was it murder? To understand why this is important you have to go back to Egypt's revolution on January 25, 2011. Back then, the regime of former president Hosni Mubarak seemed impenetrable. Mubarak had successfully run a brutal police state for decades, and almost all opposition had been neutered. But when the deep unhappiness with the state of the country and the lack of freedoms burst forth in Tahrir Square, three groups emerged at the front: activists, the Muslim Brotherhood and, strikingly, Egypt's soccer ultras. Ultras are organized fan groups who religiously follow their team.They are anti-authoritarian, independently minded and have no time for the mainstream press who characterize them as violence-addicted hooligans. But the truth was more complex than that. In 2007 I met the founders of the Ahlawy, the ultras group of Al Ahly -- Egypt's biggest team and Zamalek's main rival. What began as support for a team with European-style banners and songs about Mohamed Aboutrika, their greatest ever player, became something much more dangerous for the authorities. For years Al Ahly fans were attacked by police as they tried to watch their favorite team play. But the ultras, who had obtained a degree of anonymity in numbers and within the huge terraces of the Cairo International Stadium, fought back. ""It wasn't just supporting a team; you were fighting a system and the country as a whole,"" one of the Al Ahly founders told me in 2011. ""We were fighting the police, fighting the government, fighting for our rights ... this was something new, a little bit of a seed that was planted four years later."" When the revolution came, the ultras were on the front lines. They were the only groups that had experience confronting the police. The two teams maintain a historic rivalry but, briefly, the fans of Ahly and Zamalek -- as well as supporters from other ultras groups -- joined forces in Tahrir Square and in the other cities around Egypt. In those fleeting, free moments in post-revolution Egypt, the ultras were revered as protectors of the revolution. But as the authorities slowly reasserted their power, the narrative changed. On February 1, 2012, 72 members of the Ahlawy were killed at a football match against Al Masry in Port Said. At first, the authorities said it was hooliganism, violence between two sets of fans -- nothing more, nothing less. But it soon emerged that this couldn't have been further from the truth. A moving televised testimony by a fan who was there turned the tide of public opinion in favour of the Ahlawy. The Ahlawy maintained that the incident was organised by the state, a political assassination of a group that had become too powerful. Yet a measure of justice, at least temporarily, had been won. The league was suspended, and the Ahlawy picketed the stadiums, successfully preventing the league from returning until justice was done. Death sentences were passed down on a number of Al Masry fans, and some officials were even jailed. The Port Said tragedy showed that protest could affect change. But this is a new Egypt. The democratically-elected president, Mohamed Morsy, was deposed in a coup and replaced by General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. Hundreds of Muslim Brotherhood supporters have been shot dead at protests. Activists, like Shaimaa el-Sabbagh, have died whilst protesting peacefully. The groups that led the revolution from the front are slowly being removed from view. The image that will stay with me from Sunday night is the video posted on YouTube of a police officer firing tear gas canisters into the crowd gathered outside the ground. The crowd is so packed that it is clear no one can escape. It was the kind of casual brutality by the police towards the supporters that I'd experienced before the revolution. But the comparison here isn't with Mubarak, with the revolution, or even with Port Said. At Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield, England, 96 Liverpool fans were crushed to death at the start of an FA Cup match in 1989. Immediately the narrative had been set: The fans were drunk; they rushed the turnstiles; they stole from the bodies of the dead. The victims were besmirched by the police and newspapers like The Sun. For 25 years, families have been fighting for justice.  The verdict that the fans' deaths were accidental has been overturned, and a new coroner's inquest is underway to determine how all 96 victims died. We may never get to the bottom of what happened on Sunday night. The Zamalek president, a keen supporter of President Sisi, had already dubbed the Ultras White Knights a terrorist organization. ""They are not fans, they are criminals,"" Mansour said in an interview with The Guardian last month. ""They are using bombs, live ammunition and shotgun pellets ... And last week they threw acid at me -- but I continue because this is part of the nation's battle against terrorism."" The acid turned out to be human urine. Several ultras were jailed for the incident. The authorities announced that the leaders of the UWK would be rounded up and arrested. The UWK called Sunday's incident a ""deliberate massacre."" Fact and fiction seamlessly intertwine in the aftermath of chaos. What is clear is that the league has, once again, been suspended indefinitely as the funerals of those killed take place in the coming hours. Meanwhile Egypt is again counting the numbers of the dead. It is far from the hope and optimism I had been lucky to experience in Tahrir Square in 2011. As George Bernard Shaw once wrote, ""Revolutions have never lightened the load of tyranny, they have only shifted it to another shoulder."" And the match the fans died trying to watch? It went ahead anyway. It finished 1-1.","In the fleeting, free moments in post-revolution Egypt, the ultras were revered as protectors of the revolution, argues James Montague .

"St. Louis (CNN) -- Activist Cornel West was among more than 49 people arrested at the ""Moral Monday"" march in Ferguson, Missouri, officials said. A photo from CNN affiliate KMOV-TV in St. Louis showed police in rain gear arresting West, in a black suit, tie and scarf, and others in what appeared to be a parking lot. Shawn McGuire, a spokesman for the St. Louis County Police Department, said 49 people were arrested. Police said West and 42 other people were detained at the Ferguson Police Department protest site for disturbing the peace. The protesters tried to push through a police line, he said. A half-dozen people were arrested at another site for blocking traffic and refusing to clear the street. As expected, demonstrators demanding the arrest of the police officer who killed Michael Brown took part in a ""series of actions"" Monday. Protesters also showed up at a fundraiser in Webster Groves for County Executive candidate Steve Stenger. The event was attended by Sen. Claire McCaskill and at least six demonstrators were handcuffed by police. There also appeared to be a handful of arrests at a Ferguson Walmart. On Sunday night, about 2,000 people attended an interfaith rally, where West, who is a professor at New York's Union Theological Seminary and a noted author, was the featured speaker. Some protesters demanded a chance to speak before West took the stage at St. Louis University's Chaifetz Arena. ""If you can see a dead black boy lie in the streets for four hours and that doesn't make you angry, you lack humanity,"" a woman, who didn't give her name, told the crowd. She was referring to how long Brown's body lay on a street before investigating officers removed it after an August 9 encounter between the 18-year-old and police officer Darren Wilson, who authorities said shot the teenager after he attacked him and tried to take his gun. But witnesses said the unarmed teen had his hands in the air when he was shot. The shooting prompted weeks of protests in Ferguson, which sometimes became violent when demonstrators and police clashed. The latest protests, dubbed a ""Ferguson October"" and ""Weekend of Resistance,"" are taking place in Ferguson, St. Louis and the surrounding area. Mom, daughter trek 750 miles on $100 budget to join 'Weekend of Resistance' Demonstrators are demanding that Wilson be charged with a crime -- a point that West also made. ""Everybody knows if you shoot somebody down, you should be arrested,"" he said. He asked the crowd to channel their rage into a plan of action for change. New wave of protests . Before this week, protests had died down considerably. But early Sunday, protesters threw rocks at police and tried to storm a QuikTrip store, according to tweets from St. Louis Metropolitan Police Chief Sam Dotson. In the Shaw neighborhood of St. Louis, protesters have also rallied against the death of Vonderrit Deondre Myers, 18. Protests erupted there after a white police officer fatally shot the black teenager Wednesday. Authorities said the teenager was armed and fired at the officer, but Myers' relatives said they don't believe the police account. Two groups of protesters gathered in Shaw before splitting and reconvening at St. Louis University, according to CNN affiliate KTVI-TV in St. Louis. One group threw a volleyball and jumped rope while chanting, ""This is what a game looks like. We aren't playing games."" The group marched to the QuikTrip, a reminder of the violence that happened in Ferguson, where protesters destroyed such a store in the days after the Brown shooting. Police were at the convenience store, which had been closed as a precaution, the station reported. The crowd prompted Dotson to tweet that demonstrators were trying to ""storm"" the gas station, and he warned that ""protesters engaging in illegal behavior will be subject to arrest."" After clerks locked the QuikTrip door, fearing the store could be looted and burned like the one in Ferguson, police in riot gear used pepper spray on sitting protesters surrounding the QuikTrip, CNN affiliate KPLR-TV reported. Police told the protesters to disperse, but they wouldn't, so officers moved in, clacking their night sticks on their leg shields as they approached, the station said. Dotson tweeted that protesters threw rocks at police. Seventeen people were arrested for unlawful assembly, but no injuries or property damage was reported, KPLR said. 'They attacked people' Ferguson October, the group that helped organize the protests, took issue with Dotson's tweets, saying they only made matters worse. ""Today protestors in St. Louis showed the best of our democracy and the St. Louis police demonstrated the worst of their out-of-control law enforcement agency. The police brutalized peaceful people protesting their brutality,"" the statement said. ""With batons and chemical agents they attacked people peacefully sitting on the ground and the reporters who were there with them."" At St. Louis University, about 1,000 protesters gathered on campus, using the hashtag #OccupySLU to convince people and businesses to donate supplies or join an all-night sit-in. Early Monday morning, about 80 protesters remained on campus, KMOV reported. ""The goal was to occupy SLU and to kind of wake up the campus. I think there's a sense in the community that SLU is kinda shut off from what happens outside of SLU. But this latest incident was six blocks from SLU, so it does affect us,"" freshman David Gramling told the station. Early Monday morning, about 200 protesters marched from the site where Myers was shot, holding signs that read, ""Black lives matter."" Police with riot gear showed up on a bridge near the St. Louis University campus. The protesters turned on the other side of the street, stayed on the sidewalk and walked past them. The demonstrations were peaceful, and the protesters said they were serious about keeping them that way. On Sunday, Ferguson October was training protesters in nonviolent civil disobedience. ""Nonviolence is really important because you're not going to change someone's mind by being violent. And also there is just so much more power in taking a stand and doing it nonviolently,"" Jasmin Maurer, who is taking part in the peaceful training, told KPLR. Meanwhile, authorities also took additional steps to prepare for the protests, as police told KMOV that every patrol officer in St. Louis -- city and county -- is working 12-hour shifts and days off have been canceled. City police would not say how many officers were working in the area, but a county police sergeant told the station there were about 200 officers in Ferguson alone. CNN's Bill Kirkos, Sara Weisfeldt, Steve Almasy and Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report.","NEW: Total of people arrested increases to 49, with more handcuffed at events Monday evening .

"(CNN)How much information is too much information? When British tennis player Heather Watson said in a post-match interview that she lost her Australian Open round due to ""girl things,"" she sparked a debate about menstruation that quickly spread across the world. ""Has sport's last taboo been broken?"" wondered commentators, after the 22-year-old described feeling ""light-headed"" and ""low on energy,"" putting it down to her period. ""We talk about sex quite openly, we talk about breast enlargements, we talk about so many things that people don't even bat an eyelid about these days,"" former British number one tennis player, Annabel Croft, told CNN. ""Yet this particular subject never gets discussed. And I can understand why -- it's a bit uncomfortable viewing isn't it?"" said the founder of her own line of leak-proof underwear called ""Diary Doll."" ""But the fact that Heather said what she said in a very innocent, charming way, I think it made people think 'wow' this does happen to athletes at that particular time of the month."" With the world's media scrutinizing their every move, it often feels as though nothing is out of bounds when discussing the physical and mental conditions of elite athletes. Indeed, Argentine footballer Javier Mascherano didn't bat an eyelid as he told reporters he'd torn his anus in a goal-saving stretch during last year's World Cup. While English cricketer Michael Yardy flew home early from an international tour in 2011, revealing he was suffering depression. ""Women's business"" So why the silence when it comes to a fact of nature that affects most female athletes -- and in Watson's case apparently influenced the outcome of her match? ""Even grown women in the office, when they make the walk from their cubicle to the bathroom discreetly tuck a tampon or pad up their sleeve or decide whether to carry their purse with them -- not to hide the blood itself, but the fact that they're bleeding,"" Karen Houppert, author of ""The Curse: Confronting the Last Unmentionable Taboo, Menstruation,"" told CNN. She said the secrecy was partly to do with workplaces historically being ""men's spaces,"" which women have adapted to. ""I think it's also linked to sexuality in ways that makes people feel uncomfortable,"" Houppert added. ""Girl things"" While Houppert supported Watson's candor, she said describing menstruation as ""girl things"" perpetuated a culture of concealment. ""I wish she could have just been direct about it, because I think that adds to the weirdness surrounding this topic,"" said Houppert. ""Our history of talking about menstruation is really full of euphemisms that people have used for centuries: Wrong time of the month; Communists in the summer house; The misery; Under the weather; Weeping wound; Package of troubles."" Could the British number one tennis player have actually set back feminism in the sports arena by bringing up her period in the first place? ""It's potentially problematic for women because our periods can get used against us,"" said Houppert. ""It's easy to dismiss a woman as 'oh she's on her rags' if someone is angry or emotional. It's a way of discounting the validity of what a woman is saying."" Professional cyclist, Inga Thompson, said there was a fine line between openness and undermining women's sporting abilities. ""I feel very protective of our sport. You don't want to pull the 'girl card,' because we've fought so hard for equal representation,"" she told CNN. ""It's true that the day before or the day after I started my period, I was a little weaker. Was I ever so weak that I felt I lost a race because of it? No."" In Croft's case, she once felt so dizzy from her period she had to walk away from a Grand Slam match -- ""I didn't feel like I could talk about why I had to do this. Like so many female athletes I suffered in silence,"" she said. Man up? Every woman is different and menstruation needn't be the deciding factor on the playing field. After all, British runner Paula Radcliffe told the BBC​ she had her period when she broke the world record at the Chicago Marathon in 2002. In some cases, professional cyclists naturally miss periods due to low body weight, said Thompson. ​ . On the tennis circuit, players sometimes take the pill to skip their period during a major competition said Croft, who recalled the immense pressure of playing at Wimbledon in a white skirt, with her period, and the world's camera lenses trained on her every move. ""It's a nightmare, particularly because the skirts are flapping up in the wind the whole time and you definitely don't want to have an accident,"" she said. ""There is only one toilet break a set -- and matches can go on a long time!"" Breaking the cycle . So does that mean Watson has heralded a new era of openness among female athletes? ""What she has done is open up a world debate, and I think it will be easier to talk about it in the future because that subject has been broached now. I think it's been quite groundbreaking,"" said Croft. ""But whether or not a journalist is brave enough in a press conference to ask: 'Did you lose today because you had your period?' I'm not sure if that's ever going to be the case.""

"(CNN) -- Ghana's World Cup challenge is in danger of imploding after two of its star players were thrown out of their squad following allegations of physical and verbal attacks within the team's camp. Sulley Muntari and Kevin-Prince Boateng were both suspended indefinitely by the Ghana Football Association just a day after the players had finally settled a row over appearance fees. Muntari, who plays his football with Italian side AC Milan, was accused of launching an ""unprovoked physical attack"" on Moses Armah -- a member of the GFA, in a statement on their website. The incident, which took place on Tuesday according to the GFA, has led to Muntari's expulsion from the camp. He is joined by Milan teammate Boateng, who the GFA says launched ""vulgar verbal insults"" at coach Kwesi Appiah during training this week. ""Boateng has since showed no remorse for his actions which has resulted in the decision,"" added the GFA statement. Boateng told CNN's Chris Eldergill that he had been suspended, but dismissed reports of a fight with Muntari, who was not immediately available for comment. In an interview with German magazine, Sport-Bild, Boateng says he ""absolutely accepts"" his punishment and blamed a training ground bust-up for his exclusion. ""Sulley Muntari and I were just joking around, and the coach stopped the session and sent us back to the changing room,"" said Boateng. ""Afterwards I went to him and asked what he had against me and he started yelling. He insulted me."" ""No-one should think I insulted the coach. I'm traveling now, and I wish my colleagues all the best for the match against Portugal,"" added Boateng, referring to Ghana's final World Cup Group G match Thursday. Ghana's campaign had already been blighted by controversy over the payment of appearance fees to players. Following a standoff between players and the GFA, the nation's government was forced to fly $3 million in cash to Brazil to pay players their fees and fend off the prospect of a boycott. According to coach Appiah, ""the practice in Ghana has always been paying the money in cash"" as many of the players don't have Ghanian bank accounts. Deputy Sports Minister Joseph Yamin told Ghanaian radio station Citi FM: ""The government mobilized the money and chartered a flight to Brazil."" A statement from the Ghana Football Association said: ""The government is pre-financing the payment of the Black Stars appearance fees, which will be reimbursed when FIFA's prize money for Ghana's participation in the World Cup is paid."" Ghana's participation in the World Cup is already under threat with victory against Portugal a must if it is to qualify for the last 16. The African nation, which reached the quarterfinals four years ago, must defeat Portugal and hope the U.S. fails to gain a result against Germany, though Boateng had already been ruled out of Thursday's game having been sent off in Ghana's 2-2 draw against Germany Saturday. The news will be of great encouragement to the U.S. which sits second in the group following an opening victory over Ghana and a 2-2 draw with Portugal. Jurgen Klinsmann's team takes on the Germans in Recife Thursday needing just a point to qualify for the last 16. But fans hoping to access the stadium were facing a challenge with rainfall causing chaos around the city. CNN's Fred Pleitgen, who is in Recife, says roads are flooded and traffic is chaotic.","Ghana has sacked two of its star players .

"Yes, the Iraq War was a war for oil, and it was a war with winners: Big Oil. It has been 10 years since Operation Iraqi Freedom's bombs first landed in Baghdad. And while most of the U.S.-led coalition forces have long since gone, Western oil companies are only getting started. Before the 2003 invasion, Iraq's domestic oil industry was fully nationalized and closed to Western oil companies. A decade of war later, it is largely privatized and utterly dominated by foreign firms. From ExxonMobil and Chevron to BP and Shell, the West's largest oil companies have set up shop in Iraq. So have a slew of American oil service companies, including Halliburton, the Texas-based firm Dick Cheney ran before becoming George W. Bush's running mate in 2000. The war is the one and only reason for this long sought and newly acquired access. Full coverage: The Iraq War, 10 years on . Oil was not the only goal of the Iraq War, but it was certainly the central one, as top U.S. military and political figures have attested to in the years following the invasion. ""Of course it's about oil; we can't really deny that,"" said Gen. John Abizaid, former head of U.S. Central Command and Military Operations in Iraq, in 2007. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan agreed, writing in his memoir, ""I am saddened that it is politically inconvenient to acknowledge what everyone knows: the Iraq war is largely about oil."" Then-Sen. and now Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said the same in 2007: ""People say we're not fighting for oil. Of course we are."" For the first time in about 30 years, Western oil companies are exploring for and producing oil in Iraq from some of the world's largest oil fields and reaping enormous profit. And while the U.S. has also maintained a fairly consistent level of Iraq oil imports since the invasion, the benefits are not finding their way through Iraq's economy or society. These outcomes were by design, the result of a decade of U.S. government and oil company pressure. In 1998, Kenneth Derr, then CEO of Chevron, said, ""Iraq possesses huge reserves of oil and gas-reserves I'd love Chevron to have access to."" Today it does. Exclusive: Hans Blix on 'terrible mistake' in Iraq . In 2000, Big Oil, including Exxon, Chevron, BP and Shell, spent more money to get fellow oilmen Bush and Cheney into office than they had spent on any previous election. Just over a week into Bush's first term, their efforts paid off when the National Energy Policy Development Group, chaired by Cheney, was formed, bringing the administration and the oil companies together to plot our collective energy future. In March, the task force reviewed lists and maps outlining Iraq's entire oil productive capacity. Planning for a military invasion was soon under way. Bush's first Treasury secretary, Paul O'Neill, said in 2004, ""Already by February (2001), the talk was mostly about logistics. Not the why (to invade Iraq), but the how and how quickly."" In its final report in May 2001 (PDF), the task force argued that Middle Eastern countries should be urged ""to open up areas of their energy sectors to foreign investment."" This is precisely what has been achieved in Iraq. Here's how they did it. The State Department Future of Iraq Project's Oil and Energy Working Group met from February 2002 to April 2003 and agreed that Iraq ""should be opened to international oil companies as quickly as possible after the war."" Arwa Damon: Iraq suffocates in cloak of sorrow . The list of the group's members was not made public, but Ibrahim Bahr al-Uloum -- who was appointed Iraq's oil minister by the U.S. occupation government in September 2003 -- was part of the group, according to Greg Muttitt, a journalist and author of ""Fuel on the Fire: Oil and Politics in Occupied Iraq."" Bahr al-Uloum promptly set about trying to implement the group's objectives. At the same time, representatives from ExxonMobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Halliburton, among others, met with Cheney's staff in January 2003 to discuss plans for Iraq's postwar industry. For the next decade, former and current executives of western oil companies acted first as administrators of Iraq's oil ministry and then as ""advisers"" to the Iraqi government. Before the invasion, there were just two things standing in the way of Western oil companies operating in Iraq: Saddam Hussein and the nation's legal system. The invasion dealt handily with Hussein. To address the latter problem, some both inside and outside of the Bush administration argued that it should simply change Iraq's oil laws through the U.S.-led coalition government of Iraq, which ran the country from April 2003 to June 2004. Instead the White House waited, choosing to pressure the newly elected Iraqi government to pass new oil legislation itself. Did Iraq give birth to the Arab Spring? This Iraq Hydrocarbons Law, partially drafted by the Western oil industry, would lock the nation into private foreign investment under the most corporate-friendly terms. The Bush administration pushed the Iraqi government both publicly and privately to pass the law. And in January 2007, as the ''surge"" of 20,000 additional American troops was being finalized, the president set specific benchmarks for the Iraqi government, including the passage of new oil legislation to ""promote investment, national unity, and reconciliation."" But due to enormous public opposition and a recalcitrant parliament, the central Iraqi government has failed to pass the Hydrocarbons Law. Usama al-Nujeyfi, a member of the parliamentary energy committee, even quit in protest over the law, saying it would cede too much control to global companies and ""ruin the country's future."" In 2008, with the likelihood of the law's passage and the prospect of continued foreign military occupation dimming as elections loomed in the U.S. and Iraq, the oil companies settled on a different track. Bypassing parliament, the firms started signing contracts that provide all of the access and most of the favorable treatment the Hydrocarbons Law would provide -- and the Bush administration helped draft the model contracts. Why women are less free after Iraq War . Upon leaving office, Bush and Obama administration officials have even worked for oil companies as advisers on their Iraq endeavors. For example, former U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Zalmay Khalilzad's company, CMX-Gryphon, ""provides international oil companies and multinationals with unparalleled access, insight and knowledge on Iraq."" The new contracts lack the security a new legal structure would grant, and Iraqi lawmakers have argued that they run contrary to existing law, which requires government control, operation and ownership of Iraq's oil sector. But the contracts do achieve the key goal of the Cheney energy task force: all but privatizing the Iraqi oil sector and opening it to private foreign companies. They also provide exceptionally long contract terms and high ownership stakes and eliminate requirements that Iraq's oil stay in Iraq, that companies invest earnings in the local economy or hire a majority of local workers. Iraq's oil production has increased by more than 40% in the past five years to 3 million barrels of oil a day (still below the 1979 high of 3.5 million set by Iraq's state-owned companies), but a full 80% of this is being exported out of the country while Iraqis struggle to meet basic energy consumption needs. GDP per capita has increased significantly yet remains among the lowest in the world and well below some of Iraq's other oil-rich neighbors. Basic services such as water and electricity remain luxuries, while 25% of the population lives in poverty. Share your story of the Iraq War . The promise of new energy-related jobs across the country has yet to materialize. The oil and gas sectors today account directly for less than 2% of total employment, as foreign companies rely instead on imported labor. In just the last few weeks, more than 1,000 people have protested at ExxonMobil and Russia Lukoil's super-giant West Qurna oil field, demanding jobs and payment for private land that has been lost or damaged by oil operations. The Iraqi military was called in to respond. Fed up with the firms, a leading coalition of Iraqi civil society groups and trade unions, including oil workers, declared on February 15 that international oil companies have ""taken the place of foreign troops in compromising Iraqi sovereignty"" and should ""set a timetable for withdrawal."" Closer to home, at a protest at Chevron's Houston headquarters in 2010, former U.S. Army Military Intelligence officer Thomas Buonomo, member of Iraq Veterans Against the War, held up a sign that read, ""Dear Chevron: Thank you for dishonoring our service"" (PDF). Yes, the Iraq War was a war for oil, and it was a war with losers: the Iraqi people and all those who spilled and lost blood so that Big Oil could come out ahead.","Juhasz: Opening up Iraq to foreign oil companies was main goal of Iraq War .

"Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling says he's sorry but feels he was ""baited"" to make racist comments, nearly two weeks after the NBA fined him and banned him for life for his remarks in a recorded conversation. ""When I listen to that tape, I don't even know how I can say words like that. ... I don't know why the girl had me say those things,"" he told CNN's Anderson Cooper in an exclusive interview set to air on Monday. ""You're saying you were set up?"" Cooper asked. ""Well yes, I was baited,"" Sterling said. ""I mean, that's not the way I talk. I don't talk about people for one thing, ever. I talk about ideas and other things. I don't talk about people."" Sterling, an 80-year-old married lawyer and billionaire real-estate investor, hasn't spoken publicly about the accusations since celebrity gossip website TMZ posted a 10-minute audio recording of him that drew widespread condemnation from fans, players and the league. In that audio clip, Sterling chastised friend V. Stiviano for posting pictures online of her posing with African-Americans, including basketball Hall of Famer Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson. The recording triggered a firestorm that led to Sterling's lifetime ban from the NBA and a $2.5 million fine. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has asked the other 29 owners to force Sterling, the longest-tenured owner in the league, to sell the Clippers. ""I'm not a racist,"" Sterling told Cooper. ""I made a terrible, terrible mistake. And I'm here with you today to apologize and to ask for forgiveness for all the people that I've hurt."" Asked by Cooper why he took so long to say he's sorry, Sterling said he was ""emotionally distraught."" ""The reason it's hard for me, very hard for me, is that I'm wrong. I caused the problem. I don't know how to correct it,"" he said. Sterling said he doesn't want his comments to eclipse his lengthy tenure with the NBA. ""I'm a good member who made a mistake and I'm apologizing and I'm asking for forgiveness,"" he said. ""Am I entitled to one mistake, am I after 35 years? I mean, I love my league, I love my partners. Am I entitled to one mistake? It's a terrible mistake, and I'll never do it again."" Now, Sterling said, his fate is in the league's hands. ""If the owners feel I have another chance, then they'll give it to me,"" he said. 'I thought she liked me' Last week, another audio recording surfaced online, allegedly showing Sterling trying to add context to the racist comments that got him banned from the league. In that recording, Sterling purportedly explained that his comments were driven by jealousy. ""The girl is black. I like her. I'm jealous that she's with other black guys. I want her. So what the hell, can I in private tell her, you know, 'I don't want you to be with anybody'?"" the man purported to be Sterling said in that recording, according to RadarOnline. On Sunday, Sterling told CNN that in the recording ""I spoke to a girl that I was fond of."" Stiviano told ABC News earlier this month that the recorded conversation was similar to many she's had with Sterling about race. ""There's been a number of occasions where Mr. Sterling and I had conversations just like this one,"" she said. ""Part of what the world heard was only 15 minutes. There's a number of other hours that the world doesn't know."" Sterling told CNN he's not sure who released the recording. ""I don't know. An 80-year-old man is kind of foolish, and I'm kind of foolish. I thought she liked me and really cared for me,"" he said. ""I guess being 51 years older than her, I was deluding myself. ... I just wish I could ask her why, and if she was just setting me up."" Sterling says he's spoken with Magic Johnson . Referring to Johnson, Sterling purportedly said on the recording: ""Admire him, bring him here, feed him, f**k him, but don't put (Magic) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me. And don't bring him to my games."" As criticism over the recording spread, Johnson was among the first to say that Sterling should be forced to sell the team. ""He shouldn't own a team any more. And he should stand up and say, 'I don't want to own a team any more,' "" Johnson said in an ABC pregame show interview last month. Sterling told CNN he's spoken twice with Johnson. ""Did you apologize to him?"" Cooper asked. ""If I said anything wrong, I'm sorry,"" Sterling said. ""He's a good person. I mean, what am I going to say? Has he done everything he can do to help minorities? I don't think so. But I'll say it, he's great. But I don't think he's a good example for the children of Los Angeles."" Will owners force sale? The matter of the team's sale is with the NBA's Advisory/Finance Committee, which met Wednesday in a conference call. Members discussed the ""termination of Mr. Sterling's ownership of the team,"" the NBA said in a news release. The committee will meet again next week, the statement said. NBA's strategy to force a sale hinges on 1981 document . If the case proceeds to a full vote, 75% of the owners would have to approve the forced sale. However, an attorney for Donald Sterling's estranged wife, Shelly, told CNN Friday that she wants to keep her 50% stake in the team. ""She wants to remain a passive owner,"" said attorney Pierce O'Donnell. ""She's not going to want to manage the team. She's going to want a very skilled, professional, well-heeled new owner to come in and replace Donald,"" O'Donnell said. ""She only wants to own the team in her lifetime. She's 79 years old. At this point, she's earned it. She's been an owner for 33 years, and she's an avid fan."" In an interview with ABC News on Sunday, Shelly Sterling said she was prepared to fight any attempt by the NBA to take away her stake in the team. ""I will fight that decision,"" she told ABC's Barbara Walters. ""To be honest with you, I'm wondering if a wife of one of the owners, and there's 30 owners, did something like that, said those racial slurs, would they oust the husband? Or would they leave the husband in?"" NBA spokesman Mark Bass said in a statement after the ABC interview aired that what happens if the owners vote for a forced sale is already spelled out in the NBA Constitution. ""Under the NBA Constitution, if a controlling owner's interest is terminated by a 3/4 vote, all other team owners' interests are automatically terminated as well. It doesn't matter whether the owners are related as is the case here,"" he said. ""These are the rules to which all NBA owners agreed to as a condition of owning their team.""

"Families torn apart for more than 60 years -- separated by the Korean War -- began to reunite at a mountain resort in North Korea Thursday. Without any regular forms of communications between the two Koreas, the family members have gone decades without phone calls, letters or emails -- unable to know whether their loved ones are alive or dead. The majority of the participants in South Korea are now in their 80s and 90s. The meetings are likely to be the last time the separated families will have contact with one another. Thursday's reunion is the first since November 2010. The negotiations leading to the expected reunions have also been painstaking, reflecting the tensions between North and South Korean governments. Past reunions have been emotional affairs with sobbing relatives clinging to each other and showing each other family photos. This time, the reunion wasn't conducted as freely as North Korean workers stood beside the tables and listened to every conversation. One North Korean resident thanked the Marshall, which is the country's leader, Kim Jong Un for his ""blessing"" and making the visit possible. On Thursday, the first of a six-day event, an initial 200 North and South Koreans met. Among them was Jang Chun, whose brother was 8 years old when he last saw him. Jang, a North Korean conscript during the Korean War, was taken prisoner by UN forces in South Korea. He has since lived in the South and has been unable to see his family. But four years ago, he received a letter and several photos of his family in North Korea through the Red Cross. The black-and-white photos showed his brother and a picture of his brother's wedding -- major life milestones Jang had been unable to attend. ""It was shocking,"" he said. ""I didn't even know they were alive although I had hoped they were. After reading the letter, I started crying, I was filled with both joy and sorrow."" Jang clutched the only memorabilia he has of his long-lost family. ""Whenever I miss my family, I read this letter,"" Jang said. Jang, silver-haired and aging, thought he finally got his chance when he learned he'd be part of a reunion group last September. The reunion waitlist in Seoul has thousands of names and the lucky ones are selected through a computer-generated lottery. But Pyongyang canceled the September event with only a few days notice, accusing Seoul of souring ties between the two countries. ""It was like being hit on the back of the head,"" Jang said about the shock of coming so close, only to have his hopes dashed. ""I had to take medication and sedatives."" It may have felt like deja-vu for Jang earlier this month. After the Korean governments reached an agreement to hold reunions, less than a day later, North Korea said it may back out if South Korea holds its annual military drills with the United States. South Korea has refused to cancel the annual drills. Pyongyang's attempts to link the reunions to politics were rejected by both Seoul and Washington who see it as a purely humanitarian issue. Jang finally got his wish, trembling, while he held the hands of his younger brother, Jang Hwa Chun and younger sister Jang Keum Soon, who both live in North Korea. Jang had brought his son, Jang Ki-woong, who met his North Korean uncle and aunt for the first time. They learned coincidentally that both Jang's son and his younger brother had become locomotive engineers. Jang's younger sister burst into tears during the conversation. ""Every time a train passes by, I thought (about you),"" Jang Keum Soon told her South Korean brother, sobbing. ""I missed you, older brother."" Jang's son vowed to his North Korean aunt and uncle: ""I will drive a train and come here. I am a locomotive engineer so I will drive the train and promise to come back. Until then, please stay healthy and live a long life."" Although delayed by snow, 82 South Korean participants accompanied by 58 other members arrived Thursday afternoon and were scheduled to have lunch before finally meeting their families. The reunion ended for the day around 5 p.m. Trust remains tenuous in the peninsula, separated by the world's most fortified border—the Demilitarized Zone and rocked by North Korea's nuclear test last year. The rarity of inter-Korea reunions meant that many participants in ill health insisted on going to Mount Kumgang for the event, desperate for a chance to see their relatives. Nineteen of the South Korean participants were in wheelchairs. Two South Korean participants departed for the reunion venue by ambulance, one of them was receiving an IV drip, refusing to miss the date. South Korean participants of the reunion were seen bringing gifts for their family members. The most popular gifts for families in North Korea were Choco Pies, a chocolate-covered treat, along with medicine and medical supplies like pain killers, according to YTN, a CNN affiliate in South Korea. They were greeted with a newly-made stone near their North Korean facilities that read: ""Long Live General Kim Jong Un, The Sun of Military First Korea.""","North and South Korean families to reunite in six-day event at North Korean mountain resort .

"(CNN) -- What burns five times brighter than a full moon and flies through the air with its tail sticking out behind it? Many Texas residents reported seeing a meteor streaming across the Saturday night sky. They were right, but scientists are still investigating the details, said Dr. Bill Cooke, lead for NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office. ""This was definitely what we call a fireball, which by definition is a meteor brighter than the planet Venus,"" he told reporters in a conference call Sunday. ""This event was so bright that it was picked up on a NASA meteor camera in the mountains of New Mexico over 500 miles away, which makes it extremely unusual,"" he said. ""This was a very bright event."" Based on data from NASA's camera, Cooke estimated that the meteor was at least four feet wide, weighed about 4,000 pounds and burned five times brighter than a full moon. The American Meteor Society has received more than 200 reports about it so far from people in various parts of the Lone Star State, who reported seeing it within minutes of the same time -- 8:45 p.m. Central (9:45 p.m. ET). Descriptions of the fleeting flash spread rapidly on social media. One YouTube user apparently caught it whizzing by on camera and posted video online. Did any pieces of it make their way to Earth? It's possible meteorites from the fireball hit the ground, Cooke said. To find out, investigators will be looking at things like weather radar data, he said. The Maverick County Sheriff's Department reported around 8:45 p.m. that the ground shook when a meteorite landed, the National Weather Service in San Antonio said. Where did the fireball come from? When a piece of a comet or asteroid hurtling through space enters the Earth's atmosphere, pressure causes it to break apart violently in an explosion, Cooke said. The fireball that Texans spotted Saturday night could have come from the North Taurid meteor shower, which is going on right now and is known for producing bright fireballs, Cooke said. It also could have been part a piece of rock from the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, he said. ""We're going to have to wait until we get more data to discriminate between the two of them,"" Cooke said. Why did so many people notice it? A NASA camera near Mayhill, New Mexico, captured an image of the sky that shows the brief, bright flash around 8:40 p.m. Central Time. Another camera in Las Cruces, New Mexico, didn't capture the event itself, but detected a change in the sky's brightness because of the fireball. Fireballs aren't uncommon, Cooke said. Thousands of them occur in the Earth's atmosphere each day, the American Meteor Society says. But most of them happen over oceans or uninhabited areas -- or are masked by daylight, the society says. ""A city dweller in the U.S. might expect to see events this bright once or twice per year,"" Cooke said. But depending on what time they hit, they tend to draw more attention. ""This one was around 8:40, so there were a lot of people outside and those events get a lot of notice,"" he said. ""There would have been far fewer reports if it happens around 3 a.m.""","NASA scientist: Fireball burned five times brighter than a full moon .

"Members of the powerful Gambino and Bonanno crime families were among 24 people arrested Tuesday in New York and several cities in Italy in a major anti-mafia raid, authorities said. The FBI and Italian police carried out the raid as part of operation ""New Bridge,"" which targeted more than 40 people for international drug trafficking and organized crime in connection with the 'Ndrangheta mafia, officials added. Italian police arrested 17 suspects, anti-mafia prosecutor Franco Roberti told reporters at a news conference in Rome. The FBI arrested seven people in New York in a coordinated raid, he added, including members of the Gambino and Bonanno families. The U.S. Attorney's Office in the Eastern District of New York named these seven suspects as 'Ndrangheta member Raffaele Valente, also known as ""Lello,"" Gambino associate Franco Lupoi, Bonanno associate Charles Centaro, also known as ""Charlie Pepsi,"" Dominic Ali, Alexander Chan, Christos Fasarakis, and Jose Alfredo Garcia, also known as ""Freddy."" The defendants are charged with drug trafficking, money laundering and firearms offenses, ""based, in part, on their participation in a transnational heroin and cocaine trafficking conspiracy involving the 'Ndrangheta, one of Italy's most powerful organized crime syndicates,"" it said. All seven pleaded not guilty Tuesday to the various charges in a federal court in Brooklyn. Afterward, four of the men -- Valente, Lupoi, Chan and Garcia -- were held without bail, though bail could become an option later. In addition to the drug and money laundering charges, Valente and Lupoi are also charged with selling an unregistered firearm silencer. Meanwhile, Centaro, Fasarakis and Ali all were free on bail. In addition to surrendering their passports, their travel within the United States is limited as well. Ali's bond was $1.4 million bond, and bond was $1 million for the other two. Investigators speaking at the news conference in Rome said the money found in the raids amounted to hundreds of thousands of dollars. The operations in Italy were carried out in the southern region of Calabria, home of the 'Ndrangheta syndicate, and in the cities of Naples, Caserta, Torino, Benevento and Catanzaro. The Italian mafia family involved in the alliance, or ""bridge,"" with the Gambino family, is called Ursino Ionica. Tuesday's operation was the first ever jointly run by U.S. and Italian police targeting the ties between the two countries' 'Ndrangheta mafia families, investigators said. Anti-mafia prosecutors in Calabria have been carrying out an investigation over the past two years, and Italian police compiled a 2,000-page report detailing what was learned, including information from phone wiretaps. U.S. Attorney: 'Lasting blow' The Italian national anti-mafia body, which coordinated the investigation and operation, alleges that the 'Ndrangheta is behind a ring of drug trafficking between South and Central America, Canada, the United States and Italy. U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch said the operation had ""dealt a lasting blow"" to the 'Ndrangheta's efforts to gain a foothold in New York. ""The 'Ndrangheta is an exceptionally dangerous, sophisticated and insidious criminal organization, with tentacles stretching from Italy to countries around the world,"" she said. ""The defendant Lupoi sought to use his connections with both 'Ndrangheta and the Gambino crime family to extend his own criminal reach literally around the globe."" Together, the accused sought to move cocaine and heroin into the United States under the guise of legitimate shipping operations, with the help of a corrupt official at the port of Gioia Tauro, in Calabria, the U.S. Attorney's Office said. Lupoi, from Brooklyn, has lived in Calabria and used his connections with both the Gambino organized crime family and the 'Ndrangheta to pursue international criminal activity, it said. Among those arrested in Italy are his father-in-law, Antonio Simonetta, and his cousin, Francesco Ursino, it said. During two joint FBI-Italian operations in Italy, Lupoi and Ursino sold more than 1.3 kilograms of heroin to an FBI undercover agent for what they believed was eventual distribution in the United States, the U.S. Attorney's Office said. In New York, Lupoi, Chan and Garcia sold the undercover agent more than a kilogram of heroin, it added. Cocaine found in canned fruit shipment . Lupoi, 44, is also accused of plotting to smuggle 500 kilograms of cocaine, concealed in frozen food, in shipping containers from Guyana, in South America, to Calabria, thanks to connections with Mexican drug cartels operating in Guyana. Italian court documents show the conspiracy slowed after shipping containers from a Guyanese shipping company were seized in Malaysia and found to contain more than $7 million in cocaine hidden in cans labeled as containing coconut milk and pineapple, the U.S. Attorney's Office said. Investigators said at the news conference that the Mexico-Calabria connection was established in New York. Law enforcement officials are still trying to establish how the drug traveled from Mexico to Guyana but said that some of the suspects took trips to Latin America following their New York meetings. The illegal traffic of drugs between the United States and Italy stopped by police could have earned the mafia millions of euros, authorities said, though they declined to give an exact figure. Raffaele Grassi, head of the Criminal Unit of the Italian State Police, told reporters that the operation demonstrated that the ""'Ndrangheta is one of the strongest organizations in the world in illegal drug trade."" He cited its sophisticated network of contacts and its ability to adapt and find new markets, including ""expanding beyond Italian borders."" Historic links . Grassi said that historically, the Gambino family had had ties with the Sicilian Mafia, Cosa Nostra. But their involvement in the illegal traffic of heroin, known as the ""Pizza Connection,"" was dismantled or severely curtailed in the 1980s, he said, and they are now trading mainly cocaine. The latest operation, according to Grassi and FBI officials, shows that the mafia families of the ""new continent"" are still seeking and relying on ""old country"" connections -- which is why investigators dubbed the operation ""New Bridge."" According to Grassi, the Italian-American mafia families ""need this new bridge to connect and support the traffic of cocaine."" While the existence of a connection between the Calabrian mafia and U.S. mafia families has been well known, Tuesday's operation shows its great strength and reach, investigators said. One of the more alarming discoveries to emerge from the operation was evidence that 'Ndrangheta has also reached out to the Far East in the heroin trade, another investigator said.","No bail for 4 U.S. suspects; bond was set for 3 others, and all were released .
U.S. justice officials accuse these 7 arrested in New York of drug trafficking .
The raids zero in on the Calabrian mafia, the 'Ndrangheta; 17 arrested in Italy .

"Civil rights activists reenacting a 1965 march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, are doing more than just reliving an important part of American history -- they are bringing a new message to an old fight. Two days after NAACP President Ben Jealous -- along with organizer the Rev. Al Sharpton and the Rev. Jesse Jackson -- were joined by thousands of people, both young and old, to mark the 47th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, their journey through Alabama continues. Participants say this year -- an election year -- is about more than just remembering, it's about raising consciousness. ""Right now, we are seeing the Voting Rights Act attacked more consistently across the country than we have seen since it was passed."" Jealous said. Since crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge on Sunday, marchers are continuing on to Montgomery to bring attention to what they call a modern-day attack on voting rights. ""We need people to understand that not only is history not very distant, but we stand on the precipice of repeating it,"" Jealous said. The NAACP leader said strict voter ID laws that won't allow people to vote without a driver's license or passport are unnecessary and will make it difficult -- and in some cases impossible -- for 5 million people to vote. ""We need to make sure that the principle of one person, one vote, is respected,"" he said. New marchers -- including a Latina student from Idaho who came with other members of a campus organization called Movimiento Activista Social, and senior citizens from Boston -- all made the trip to Alabama to fight voting restrictions nationwide. Some older activists came to relive a turbulent time in American history. As a girl, Amelia Boynton, who was born in 1911, sent a letter to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. asking him to participate in the march. This time, she couldn't make the journey on foot, so Boynton is being driven along the route. She is joined by another elderly woman who was 11 and a member of the NAACP youth council on March 7, 1965. On that day, protesters fighting for the right to vote tried to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge and were beaten back by police officers and attacked by dogs. The brutal attack became known as Bloody Sunday. This month, the Alabama House of Representatives unanimously passed a resolution to gather and preserve a collection of accounts from current and former members of Congress who were involved in civil rights marches in the state. Jealous agrees that is important that people know and remember the legacy of Selma. ""We need people to know what happened,"" he said. ""We need students to know that people risked their lives."" Participants will have walked more than 20 miles by the end of day Tuesday. Once the walking ends, marchers will gather for the evening at Macedonia Church and sleep on cots, NAACP spokesman Derek Turner said. The march, which was primarily organized by the National Action Network with support from the NAACP, AFL-CIO, Service Employees International Union, National Council of La Raza and other groups, is expected to end Friday on the steps of the Capitol in Montgomery  with a call to repeal voter ID laws and Alabama's HB56, a strict anti-immigration law.","Civil rights activists are reenacting a march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama .

"The naked Florida man who chewed off the face of another man last month in a zombie-like cannibal attack used marijuana but not ""bath salts"" as police had suspected, authorities said Wednesday. Rudy Eugene, 31, was killed by a police officer after Eugene's 18-minute attack on a homeless man. His body didn't show ""any other street drugs, alcohol or prescription drugs, or any adulterants found in street drugs,"" according to the Miami-Dade County Medical Examiner Department. ""The department has also sought the assistance of an outside forensic toxicology reference laboratory, which has confirmed the absence of 'bath salts,' synthetic marijuana and LSD,"" the statement said. A video of last month's incident shows Eugene coming across 65-year-old Ronald Poppo on a sidewalk along Miami's MacArthur Causeway, stripping clothes off him and eventually chewing on his face.

Armando Aguilar, president of the Fraternal Order of Police, told CNN affiliate WPLG last month that he suspected Eugene was under the influence of ""bath salts,"" a drug that contains synthetic stimulants that can ""cause chest pains, increased blood pressure, increased heart rate, agitation, hallucinations, extreme paranoia and delusions,"" according to the National Institute of Drug Abuse. Eugene's mother said last month that her son was ""a nice kid"" who could have been subdued with a Taser rather than gunfire. ""He was a good kid. He gave me a nice card on Mother's Day.

"Sen. Rand Paul appears to be warning former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and other potential 2016 candidates that support for Common Core would be a losing position in the GOP presidential contest. ""If there's a Republican candidate out there -- let's just say there's a hypothetical one that's for Common Core. I'm saying that that hypothetical candidate that's for Common Core probably doesn't have much chance of winning in a Republican primary,"" the Kentucky Republican told Breitbart.com. His comments, published Monday, come from an interview last week while Paul was in North Carolina campaigning for Senate hopeful Thom Tillis and Rep. Walter Jones. Paul didn't mention Bush or any other potential 2016 candidate by name, but the former Florida governor has been a vocal backer of Common Core, a set of national education standards for English and math. ""The danger of having one central governmental authority deciding curriculum is, what if we get some people who decide we really need to treat Karl Marx fairly, we need to make sure he gets a good writeup in the history, and Adam Smith, oh gosh, he was terrible,"" Paul said. ""You can see how once it's nationalized, one person can insert a bias into the curriculum, and it goes everywhere, and then you have to fight it."" While conservatives accuse the program of interfering with local government control, the standards were developed by the bipartisan National Governors Association, state governments and nonprofit groups. But if states want a share of President Barack Obama's Race to the Top education grants, one of the ways to get it is by adopting Common Core. In that sense, the government created incentives for states to embrace the standards. Bush, who was campaigning for Tillis in North Carolina the week before Paul was there, reiterated his support for Common Core, according to The New York Times. Tillis did not express the same support and attacked the Department of Education. Bush says the standards help prepare students for college and the workforce. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has also offered support for Common Core, though he created a panel to review and improve the program's implementation in the Garden State. Republican Govs. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and Rick Perry of Texas have been fiercely opposed. Jindal sued the Obama administration over the issue this year and announced plans to take Louisiana out of the program, while Texas was one of five states that didn't adopt the standards at all. In the Senate, Republicans Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida are two potential presidential candidates who have also been highly critical of Common Core. Paul has previously weighed in on his disdain for the program, saying in August that he believes education standards ""should be developed locally"" and reiterating his wish to eliminate the Department of Education. ""The kids are tested to death, I think, and not necessarily any smarter,"" he said at a Republican event in Urbandale, Iowa. ""Is testing good? Yes, but I would let local people figure that out."" ""I also think we make a mistake as Republicans blaming teachers for everything, you know, because frankly some of the fault ... we need to look in the mirror; it's parents' fault as well,"" he continued.","Sen.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Larry Flynt's Hustler magazine claimed credit for exposing Sen. David Vitter's connection to the ""D.C. Madam"" Tuesday, saying Vitter confessed after a journalist reported finding the senator's number in the escort service's phone records. Sen. David Vitter apologized after his telephone number appeared among those linked to an escort service. ""Larry Flynt's ongoing investigation into the dirty secrets of prominent elected officials has exposed another hypocrite,"" Hustler said. Vitter, R-Louisiana, admitted Monday that his telephone number turned up in the phone records of an escort service run by Deborah Jeane Palfrey, though he did not say he had sex with a prostitute. The records date from before he won his Senate seat in 2004. ""This was a very serious sin in my past for which I am, of course, completely responsible,"" Vitter said in a statement given to reporters Monday night. ""Several years ago, I asked for and received forgiveness from God and from my wife in confession and marriage counseling."" Vitter, 46, represented New Orleans suburbs in the House of Representatives from 1999 to 2004, when he ran for the Senate. He is married and has four children.  Watch what some in Vitter's state say about the admission » . Vitter was one of the top backers of a failed constitutional amendment that would have banned same-sex marriage and serves as the Southern regional chairman of former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani's presidential campaign. In his Monday statement, he offered his ""deep and sincere apologies to all I have disappointed and let down in any way."" Palfrey was indicted in March on charges of money laundering and racketeering stemming from her business, Pamela Martin & Associates, which prosecutors allege was involved in prostitution. Palfrey has denied the charges, saying she operated a legitimate escort service. In an effort to raise money for her legal defense, Palfrey tried to sell a telephone list containing names of more than 10,000 clients. A judge blocked her from selling the information, but she provided some of the documents to media outlets. Dan Moldea, an investigative journalist working with Palfrey on a book, told CNN that he discovered Vitter's number in Palfrey's phone records and passed the information to Flynt. ""I had no idea who he was prior to then, although I'm sure he was a client and he's stated accordingly, but I don't remember this man,"" Palfrey said. Hustler said an editor at the magazine called Vitter's office for a response Monday evening, spurring Vitter to issue his statement to The Associated Press. Paul Colford, a spokesman for the wire service, said Vitter's statement ""came into the AP's New Orleans bureau without prior contact from the AP."" Flynt took out a full-page ad in The Washington Post in June to offer $1 million for ""documented evidence of illicit sexual or intimate relations with a congressman or senator."" Flynt launched a similar campaign in 1998 in an effort to counter the drive to impeach then-President Bill Clinton over allegations that he had lied about his relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Moldea worked with Flynt in that effort as well. Moldea told CNN that he is a paid consultant for Flynt and Hustler and is not eligible for the $1 million prize. Hustler's search led to the resignation of House Speaker-designate Robert Livingston -- whose congressional seat Vitter won the next year. ""Flynt's team is currently continuing its investigation into improprieties by other high-ranking elected officials,"" Hustler announced. Vitter is the first lawmaker known to be linked to Palfrey's business, though State Department official Randall Tobias -- who promoted abstinence education as head of the Bush administration's effort to curb the spread of AIDS -- resigned in May after confirming he patronized Palfrey's business. Campaigning in New Hampshire on Tuesday, Giuliani said Vitter's apparent connection to the Palfrey case was a ""personal issue."" But he admitted, ""Some people disappoint you."" Vitter's disclosure follows the June resignation of Giuliani's South Carolina campaign chairman, State Treasurer Thomas Ravenel, who was indicted on cocaine charges. Giuliani told reporters Tuesday ""it's too early to tell"" if Vitter will leave his campaign, and said he should not be judged on the problems of some people associated with his campaign or with his administration as New York mayor.

"(CNN)After 32 games, 23 days and one drawn lot, it's all over. A dramatic 9-8 penalty shootout alleviated a turgid scoreless draw, but after a 23-year wait Ivory Coast will not care how they secured the silverware. The unlikely hero of the evening was Boubacar Barry, Ivory Coast's hitherto reserve goalkeeper, only promoted to the team after an injury side-lined first choice Sylvain Gbohouo. After saving two penalties, he slotted the winning kick against his opposite number, sending the West African nation into raptures. It was a bizarre and beguiling night of football in Equatorial Guinea, but the festivities were not contained to the Estadio de Bata. Millions around the world, including players past and present, took to social media to share their despair and jubilation. Here, we have compiled the juiciest online outbursts as we reflect on this, the morning after the night before. The importance of the occasion could not be understated. But an utterly uncompelling 120 minutes of football gifted few highlights. Fans were impatient. As open play drew to a close the painful inevitability of penalties awaited. Ivory Coast's Gervinho, subbed in the dying moments of extra time and knowing he would play no further part, couldn't bring himself to watch the shootout. Sitting despondently in a plastic chair, the internet turned on the Ivorian striker and reacted in the only way it knows how: a meme. Both teams missed two penalties apiece, calling forth the dreaded sudden death. With the late drama, all was forgiven according to ESPN. Neutrals reveled in the late drama. With all outfield players having stepped up, it was down to the goalkeepers. Tom Gann was at hand to provide a Marxist reading of the situation. As Boubacar Barry broke the deadlock, Ivory Coast legend Didier Drogba reacted to the moment. With the help of The Simpson's Jasper Beardly, one parody account summed by the absurdity of the situation. Wyclef Jean of The Fugees was quick to offer both his congratulations and commiserations. Ghanaian recording artist M.anifest was despairing. The post-match analysis was swift and cutting, some suggesting the Ghanaians could have done with a little more training and a little less of this: . The Black Cats' John Mensah was magnanimous in defeat... ...And the hero Boubacar Barry was humble in victory. There were consequences for ex-Ghana player Samuel Kuffour, who bet his team would win.

"The U.S.-led coalition fighting ISIS in Syria has stepped up its attacks on the militant Islamist group's de facto capital, with 30 airstrikes targeting Raqqa overnight, the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Sunday. Separately, another opposition activist group based in Raqqa reported that about 30 airstrikes by ""the crusader alliance"" targeted areas northwest of the city. Previously, coalition strikes have primarily targeted Kobani, near the Turkey border. The attacks in Raqqa mark an increase in coalition activity there. Last week, almost 100 people were killed in Syrian government airstrikes in Raqqa, the observatory said. Many more were critically injured. Government warplanes carried out at least 10 airstrikes in Raqqa, targeting the city's al-Hani Mosque and the public souk, or market, the observatory said, using reports from activists and residents on the ground. Extremists have made the city, which sits on the banks of the Euphrates River, the de facto capital of their self-declared Islamic State that stretches across large areas of Syria and Iraq. The city is known as a place where ISIS puts training centers, weapons depots and accommodations for fighters. During the Syrian conflict, the group has also seized military bases from the Syrian regime near the city and in the wider Raqqa province. Syria has been embroiled in a three-year civil war, with government troops battling ISIS and other rebels. Fighting raged across the country on Sunday, the observatory said, with more than 40 people reported dead in airstrikes, shelling and raids. A leader of al Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra was among those killed in clashes north of Aleppo, the observatory said. The Islamist militant group, also known as al-Nusra Front, is also trying to establish an Islamic state, though primarily in Syria. It has been gaining ground and has emerged as one of the most effective groups fighting the Syrian regime during the civil war, drawing on foreign fighters with combat experience in Iraq and elsewhere.

"Few laws can drive political discourse and posturing like the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare. The individual mandate was one of its most contentious aspects. Today, though, it's another mandate -- the employer penalty -- that is garnering headlines. The Obama administration announced it would delay the implementation of the employer penalty for a year, until 2015. This move is sure to please businesses that employ a large number of lower-wage employees who don't receive comprehensive health insurance. But it's also been met with other cries of dismay. Some have declared the delay another bit of evidence that Obamacare is fatally flawed and that it should be repealed immediately. Others have declared that this delay bodes poorly for the individual mandate, which should not be attacked. And still more have taken it as a larger indication of the state of the administration, that it spells doom for immigration overhaul, that it's a sign of a tyrannical administration, or that it's just one more illustration of incompetence in getting Obamacare off the ground. For the most part, these are all political posturing. The employer penalty, like the individual mandate, is just one small part of a very large law. It serves a specific purpose, and although Obamacare will not perform as efficiently without it, it will still function. The employer penalty is complicated. The first thing to know is that it only applies to businesses with more than 50 full-time-equivalent employees. Any ""small business"" with 50 or fewer employees doesn't have to provide insurance at all. If you have more than 50 workers, you have to provide comprehensive insurance to your employees that covers a core set of benefits, and the premiums can't cost workers more than 9.5% of their income. If you don't, you pay a penalty of $2,000 for each full-time worker -- your total of employees minus 30. Alternatively, you can provide them with much less comprehensive plans that meet ""minimum essential coverage."" But employees can refuse this coverage and instead go to an exchange in their state to obtain health insurance. If they do, businesses will pay a penalty of $3,000 for each employee who goes to an exchange and qualifies for a subsidy from the federal government. These penalties can add up to millions for large employers. So companies are taking them seriously. But it's important to put things in perspective. It's likely that more than 95% of businesses are smaller than the 50-employee limit, so few need concern themselves with the penalty at all. Moreover, of the 4% of employers who are large enough to have the penalty affect them, about 95% already offer coverage. When all is said and done, the employer penalty will likely apply to about 10,000 companies out of about 6 million in the United States. Those companies employ about 1% of American workers. But the penalty will still be real to these companies. They will be thrilled to see it delayed, and they will certainly fight to see it pushed back even further, or repealed. There are some reasons to cheer them on. The employer penalty, as designed, has a lot of flaws. It encourages employers to push people into part-time jobs to have fewer full-time employees to count. It also is an incentive to get people to hire more well-off employees as opposed to poorer employees, because they can't get subsidies in the exchanges and won't incur a penalty for the employer if insurance isn't offered. So why have an employer penalty at all? The simple reason is that it lowers the cost of Obamacare. Helping people buy insurance is expensive. When people get their  insurance in the exchange with a subsidy, it costs the federal government money. When they get their insurance at their job, it costs the federal government much less. So pushing the uninsured to their employers, through the penalty, lowers the cost of Obamacare overall. If we get rid of the employer penalty, the likely effect is that the number of uninsured will not drop as much, and the cost of the law will go up. It's really that simple. Supporters of the law don't like the former, and opponents don't like the latter. So everyone will have something about which to complain. But still, the law will function, albeit less efficiently. As for me, I've never had a huge problem with the employer penalty. For better or for worse, we have an employer-based insurance system in the United States. The majority of people living here get their insurance through a job. Partly that's historical, because of wage freezes in World War II, and partly that's because the tax deduction for employer-sponsored insurance makes it all the more enticing to get insurance instead of wage increases. So if we want to continue this type of system, it makes sense to have employers either provide insurance to their workers or pay some sort of tax, or penalty, to help the government do it for them. That doesn't mean there aren't better ways to do this. First of all, we could uncouple insurance from jobs entirely. There's really no good reason to have the system function this way. Past proposals, such as the Wyden-Bennett plan, would reduce employer-based insurance substantially. Sen. John McCain proposed eliminating the employer-sponsored insurance deduction in his 2008 presidential campaign. Even a single-payer plan, such as Medicare for all, would accomplish this task. Short of that, if you want to keep this system intact, other mechanisms such as an overall payroll tax instead of this employer penalty would have removed the various bad incentives to favor wealthy or part-time employees. It's a fixable problem. But fixing it would require a functioning government. It would need Congress to pass a bill replacing or eliminating the employer mandate, and then the president to sign it. That's not going to happen. Opponents of Obamacare don't appear eager to fix the law in ways that would make it less unpopular or repeal less likely. Supporters don't appear eager to spend political capital to tinker with a law that cost them so much to pass in the first place. So we'll get administrative fixes such as this one, which wind up pleasing few, other than those who enjoy political theater.","Employer penalty for not providing full health care delayed for a year, till 2015.

"In front of a packed Great Hall of the People, outgoing Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao delivered his last government work report as he opened the National People's Congress. During the coming days, the country's top officials will discuss national priorities for the years ahead, and formally appoint the president who'll oversee them. Four months after taking over as General Secretary of the Communist Party, Xi Jinping will replace outgoing president Hu Jintao. Li Keqiang will become premier, replacing Wen Jiabao. Opening the NPC, Wen urged delegates to ""unite as one and work hard to finish building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and achieve the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,"" according to state-run media Xinhua. Firm economic targets include annual growth of 7.5% in 2013, along with efforts to keep consumer price inflation at around 3.5%. Nine million new jobs would be created, he said, in order to keep urban unemployment no more than 4.6%. Wen touched on what some see as the biggest challenge facing the country: The disparity in wealth and opportunity between city dwellers and migrant workers who have left the countryside in their millions to tap into the economic boom. ""The development gap between urban and rural areas and between regions is large, and so are income disparities between individuals,"" Wen said, according to Xinhua. He said the government needs to ""promptly formulate specific policies"" to build on planned reforms to the income distribution system. China: Three challenges for new leaders . The need to tackle corruption and to reduce the environmental toll of economic growth also emerged in reports from the congress on state media. A separate session of the government's top advisory body began on Sunday. Delegates from around the country have been arriving in Beijing for the meetings, which, while highly choreographed, are expected to shed light on the future direction of China, which many people believe is at a crossroads. Many risks and challenges . This winter has seen its worst pollution in living memory, angering a population already jaded by a series of high-profile corruption scandals -- including the downfall of the once high-flying politician Bo Xilai -- that have tainted the reputation of the party. In a speech published by the People's Daily on Sunday, Xi warned that China faced many risks and challenges, saying that the party's future was at stake. ""All party members, especially leaders should have the sense of urgency that our skills and abilities require constant sharpening and renewing,"" Xi said in the speech that was given on Friday at the Central Party School that trains officials. ""The goal of 'two 100 years' can only be achieved when we become a party that keeps learning and improving."" The NPC, which takes places at The Great Hall of the People in Tiananmen Square and ends on March 17, will give Xi the opportunity to lay out his policies, and he is expected to make fighting corruption a priority. In several speeches since he took control of the Communist Party in November, he has warned that corruption could lead to the collapse of the party and the downfall of the state. ""The central government stresses the change of working style, we encourage more learning, more thinking and less wasteful dinner parties and pointless formalism and bureaucracy,"" Xi said on Friday. Food scandals . Beijing is also planning to create a single agency to deal with food and drug regulation after a string of deadly scandals surrounding food safety, the South China Morning Post reported. Ordinary Chinese are trying to make their voices heard as the meetings commence and one group airing their grievances is migrant workers. ""We are all Chinese citizens. Why are our kids not treated equally, like those with permanent Beijing residency? We live and work here and pay the taxes as well,"" one woman told CNN at a protest outside the capital's municipal education commission on Thursday. She said the children of migrant workers living in Beijing are discriminated against because they cannot take part in college entrance exams that play a key part in determining a child's future. China's new leaders will also be looking to project strength not just at home but also on the global stage. Beijing has been standing up to its neighbor Japan over a disputed chain of islands and recently landed a fighter jet on the deck of an aircraft carrier for the first time.","Wen Jiabao opens annual session of China's parliament .

"(CNN)He's a man that divides opinion and in the past has even jokingly compared himself to a James Bond villain stroking a white Persian cat. But forget felines -- it's equine beasts that really stir the emotions of the head of world football's governing body, Sepp Blatter. FIFA president since 1998 and bidding for a fifth term in the post, horses have always played a big part in the 78-year-old's life. ""When I was a young boy in my home city of Visp, which is a very small village, our neighbors, our uncles and especially my godfather had a horse,"" Blatter told CNN Equestrian, reflecting on his Swiss childhood. ""And the horse for me was always very attractive,"" he added. ""I was also in the Swiss Army as a high-level officer, I was a commander of a regiment -- definitely [there] you have contact with horses."" Blatter, who has been involved with FIFA since 1975, was recently a special guest at the CSI Zurich horse show. It's an event the Swiss has always made room for in his diary despite the challenge of running football's world governing body. ""This is what we like in football -- connecting people,"" Blatter said, comparing the world of equestrian and football. ""And you have seen the public, the public is happy with that. Because it's the big presentation, they listen, they listen. ""And here [at the horse show] they go, it's like football. It's like a football game. And I like that."" FIFA even sponsors a spin-off event at the CSI Zurich show, involving parents and children competing together as a team in horse jumping and with a ball at their feet. ""Sepp Blatter is a good friend of us,"" said CSI Zurich co-president Rolf Theiler. ""I remember 15 years ago, it was the first time he was at the horse show and he saw the spectators, he saw the horses and said, 'FIFA must be a sponsor at the horse show.' ""I said, 'Sepp is that possible?' and he said, 'I will do sponsoring at the horse show with FIFA.' It's fantastic."" The FIFA chief added: ""It's a family prize and this is wonderful. It's not about who's the best, but the best combination."" He might have a special place in his heart for horses, but Blatter admits to having always preferred to admire them from afar rather than jump on board one.

"(CNN)In the movie ""Field of Dreams,"" Kevin Costner plays Ray Kinsella, a man who listens to a voice inside his head. The voice tells Ray to plow under his sole source of income -- his Iowa cornfield -- and build a baseball diamond for the ghosts of long dead Chicago Black Sox stars to come play in. The voice in his head says don't test out the idea, don't talk to anyone to see if it'll work, just build it, and they will come. Kinsella builds the field, the ghosts of the players arrive, and he's vindicated. That's how it works in the movies. In reality, of course, it doesn't work that way. Just because you can build something doesn't mean you should. Even if you cook up something cool and new and make it available, real people may still not want it. Google seems to have stumbled on that simple fact last week. The tech world was surprised by an announcement that on January 19, Google Glass will be withdrawn from the marketplace. Sales didn't catch fire. Apparently, people didn't have much use for it.  Google may have needed to stop and listen to the needs and emotions of people in the everyday world of consumers. Good things certainly flowed from Google Glass. A mainstream conversation started about wearable tech, taking it out of the lab and thrusting it into the clutches of consumers. By pushing its agenda into this area, Google will help open the floodgates of products that deliver the promise of the Internet of Things. Google Glass is a demonstration of what gives American business an edge. This kind of applied technology, that creates leaps into a whole new category of products and economic territory, is the essence of American competitiveness. But Google's fast retreat exposes the most fundamental sin that companies make with the ""build it and they will come"" approach. It's a process that tech companies rely on, referred to as public beta testing. But, in one sense, it treats consumers like guinea pigs: a company such as Google invents a test product such as Google Glass, throws it into the marketplace and asks people to actually pay (in Google Glass' case: $1,500) for the privilege of beta testing their unfinished brainstorm. Companies are so focused on the mousetrap, like Google Glass, they tend to lose touch with the emotions and needs of the people they actually work for: consumers. Astro Teller, head of Google Glass development at Google X research labs, admitted as much. The team looked inside Google to the technology they could produce, to make Google Glass, and they didn't fully understand what value Google Glass would play in people's lives.  There are other clues that Google had little advance interest in their consumers' real feelings about the value of smart eyeglass technology. Before launch, Google didn't anticipate that few would want to pay (or could afford) $1,500 to parade in public with a device slung around their eyes that others might perceive as either a threat to others' privacy or a pretentious geeky gadget. Google designated early adopters as ""Explorers,"" but the outside world didn't quite see them that way. ""Glasshole"" was the word people invented to describe Google Glass wearers. They were thrown out of bars and banned from movie theaters because of privacy and intellectual property concerns. Google Glass showed, yet again, that Silicon Valley's idea of fashion has precious little to do with the tastes of the rest of the world. Google execs were taken aback: they'd never anticipated rejection.  Sebastian Thurn, a key exec on the Google Glass team,  was shocked by the Glasshole label and surprised that for his officemates, wife and family, ""it was much less desirable for me to wear it than I initially thought."" Is that tone deaf? Maybe. But more than anything, Google spent its time looking inward, at how to make a product that would fit their business agenda of capturing more personal data, rather than looking outward. That was a critical mistake. Feelings and emotions that consumers bring to a product are the pistons of the consumer demand engine -- the ""demand drivers"" of why someone wants a product to begin with. Those drivers were there to be discovered and applied to the Google Glass product development process -- and none of those are connected to the company's ultimate goal of having people hand over yet more data to Google. Privacy, for example, is known as a big issue in wearable tech. Consumer confidence in the security of digital channels is low. There is not one mode through which a majority of Americans are ""very secure"" sharing private information. How Google protects information through product design helps determine whether a person will be interested in buying their product.  Google, more than any company, is familiar with this tricky relationship between technology and privacy. Yet it designed a product that raised but didn't acknowledge and address these concerns. Google seems to have also missed that fashion is personal -- and that is no less true in wearable tech.  Any wearable tech that typecasts the wearer or, worse, threatens others -- as Google Glass did -- is likely to find limited demand. Google is moving to fix the basic issues that dogged Google Glass by making product improvements, utilizing eyewear expertise, including a leader with fashion  experience, and taking advantage of a big gun for strategic guidance -- Tony Fadell -- who brought the iPod and Nest to market. We'll find out if the new team grasps the core reason Google Glass failed: the company wasn't accountable to its consumers. One can hope that in the next Google Glass round, and for other Google ""moon shots"" still incubating in the Google X lab (driverless cars, wifi balloons and glucose-sensitive contact lenses to name a few), the company's engineers will gaze outside their lab to build a field of dreams for the people intended to play there.","Google is pulling controversial Google Glass from the marketplace, rethinking it .

Being separated from mom and dad after that, and living in a strange house, is enough to make a little boy break down and cry. Through the eyes of a dog, possessive of its owner, a stranger in the house screaming at a family member can look like a threat that must be dealt with. The two scenarios cruelly collided over the weekend when a 150-lb bull mastiff fatally mauled a 5-year-old boy, puncturing his head and neck. Lynn Geiling had taken the little boy into her Jessieville, Arkansas, home after he and his family survived a monster tornado that in May waylaid Moore, Oklahoma.  His parents had returned home, 200 miles away, to gather up the pieces of their lives. Sunday, something upset the child and he threw a temper tantrum, the country sheriff's office said. Geiling went over to calm him, but the screaming upset another family member -- Geiling's dog. The dog probably thought the boy was attacking its owner, said Garland County Deputy Scott Hinojosa. It lunged for him. Geiling fought to unlock the dog's jaws from around the boy while calling to her husband for help, the sheriff's office said. She pried the dog loose, but the damage was done. The couple rushed the bleeding boy to meet an ambulance, which took him to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Authorities did not release his name. The dog ran away but was later captured.  No charges have been filed against Geiling, Hinojosa said. ""I am just really sorry that this happened in Garland County to people who have undergone such tragedy. It makes your heart bleed for them,"" Garland County Justice of the Peace Mary Bournival told CNN affiliate KATV. She was close to tears. As justice of the peace, she has seen too many maulings by dogs. She keeps a collection of gruesome photos of people with flesh torn away from their arms, legs and faces by ""bully"" breeds, as she calls them. ""I would say just in the last two months we've had at least seven attacks involving these dogs,"" she said. Her county has some of the most relaxed laws in the state, she said. ""We don't even have a simple leash law."" She wants that to change. But that would be too little too late for the little boy and his family.

"The signs pointed to the grand jury drawing near a decision as to whether Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson will be charged with a crime for fatally shooting Michael Brown. But word leaked out Saturday that when the Missouri grand jury wrapped up its session Friday, it hadn't wrapped up the case. The 12 grand jurors will meet again Monday, sources said. People are getting antsy. Supporters of Brown's family want to see Wilson go to trial. The officer's supporters want him to be vindicated. Business owners worry about their property. Officials are concerned about keeping the peace. It's still unclear when we will hear what the grand jury has decided. In the meantime, here are five things to ponder: . 1. Why were there expectations of a decision Friday? There were several indicators that something was going to happen last week. On Monday, Gov. Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency, citing the ""possibility of expanded unrest."" He also ordered the National Guard to send troops to the area. For weeks, the prosecutors' office in St. Louis County has said there likely would be a decision by mid-November. Law enforcement officials briefed on the plans said Wednesday the grand jury was going to meet Friday for what might be its final session. On Thursday, an email went out to all St. Louis County employees detailing security preparations for a grand jury announcement. 2. What does it mean that the grand jury is not done? That's hard to discern, but it's not as if they have reached the deadline to decide. That's January 7. Normally, a grand jury in St. Louis County meets every Wednesday. But the grand jury had been extended for the Brown case so jurors have extra time to hear from a number of witnesses and to focus solely on this case. In this scenario, the panel is allowed to meet on days when all 12 jurors can get together. Once agreed upon, the schedule is given to the prosecuting attorney's office. The law enforcement officials who told CNN of Friday's session also said St. Louis County prosecutors were preparing to present more evidence to the grand jury before it started deliberating. 3. What is taking the grand jury so long? Unlike in most grand jury presentations, St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch has said he was going to present every piece of evidence and witness he has, much more information than is typically given. ""Absolutely nothing will be left out, so the grand jury is making their decision based upon absolutely everything, and we'll go from there,"" he told a St. Louis radio station in August. It is an unusual approach. ""Most times prosecutors decide, 'Look, I want to get an indictment. I'm going to present the minimum amount of testimony I need to get an indictment,' "" CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin has said. McCulloch told CNN's Ana Cabrera that it had taken longer than expected to get some of the witnesses in front of the grand jury. The grand jury meets in secret, so it is impossible to know whether all the evidence has been presented and all the witnesses have testified. One possibility is the grand jury wanted to hear from a witness again. Another scenario is that the grand jurors took a break before starting their deliberations. McCulloch has told CNN that if there is no indictment, he will seek to publicly release all evidence in the case. Paul Fox, St. Louis County's director of judicial administration, sent a statement to media on Sunday that said that a judge must approve such a request and that the court will have to ""analyze the need for maintaining secrecy of the records with the need for public disclosure of the records."" 4. What are the possible outcomes a grand jury could reach? The grand jury is deciding whether Wilson should be charged with any one of several possible crimes, including: first-degree murder, second-degree murder, voluntary manslaughter or involuntary manslaughter, said Ed Magee, spokesman for the prosecuting attorney's office. The grand jury can issue an indictment on any of those four charges, and it also has the option of adding a charge of armed criminal action, authorities said. At the same time, the grand jury will receive the Missouri statutes for self-defense and the police use of deadly force. It may choose not to indict Wilson. Once it has heard all testimony and reviewed the evidence, the grand jury determines whether there is probable cause a crime or crimes have been committed. If that is the case, a ""true bill"" is found and an indictment is issued. If no true bill is found, then there is no charge. Nine of 12 grand jurors must agree that there is a true bill for the case to head to a trial hearing. But even in the case of a no true bill, prosecutors could theoretically present the evidence to a different grand jury. HLN legal analyst Joey Jackson said he thinks that is highly unlikely. Whatever the decision, officials have said they will give notice to law enforcement and other authorities before publicly announcing the outcome. 5. What do Ferguson residents say about the added wait? It seems to be a mixture of frustration and confusion for Ferguson residents. ""For me, it's like I don't understand what they are stretching it out for. Maybe they don't feel like they have enough evidence, I don't know,"" said Anthony Kelly. Others think the grand jury had a pretty easy case. ""Honestly, I don't think it should be a process. This man (Wilson) should be locked up,"" said Brandon Turner, who works in Ferguson.  ""Any civilian could have had 20 witnesses pointing at them, and he could have been locked up that day. I think this is crazy."" Some people were guardedly OK with the news that grand jury would meet again. They said rushing through could lead to the wrong decision. Turner said many people he has talked to believe that Wilson won't be indicted. ""Everybody is in shock that it's taking this long. Everybody is anticipating that he is going to get off,"" he said.","Grand jury has been solely focusing on Michael Brown shooting .
Prosecutors have said deadline is January 7, but decision likely before then .
12 jurors have more evidence and testimony to weigh than in a normal case .

"""Sport has the power to change the world,"" Nelson Mandela once said -- and the South African prisoner-turned-president also provided perhaps the most eloquent supporting evidence for his claim. ""It has the power to inspire,"" he said. ""It has the power to unite people in a way that little else does. Sport can create hope where once there was only despair. It is more powerful than government in breaking down racial barriers."" That last sentence was the closest Mandela came to referencing his own role in using sport to unify South Africa, a country that had been separated by skin color and the warped political ideology of apartheid for nearly half a century by the time he became its first black president in 1994. A year after winning South Africa's first multiracial elections, and five years after his release from prison after nearly three decades of incarceration for his anti-apartheid activities, the then-African National Congress leader revealed his acute political antennae as South Africa hosted the 1995 Rugby World Cup. The sport had long been seen as the white man's game in South Africa, and many non-whites identified the national team, the Springboks, as being synonymous with minority rule. The team's antelope emblem had been proudly worn by the country's whites-only sporting teams during apartheid. As the onetime pariah state found itself in the unusual position of welcoming the world, there were widespread fears of a racial bloodbath. Some groups were keen to avenge the years of racial oppression, while some right-wing whites were plotting violent protests against the new black majority rule. Despite their readmission in 1992 to international rugby, after years of apartheid-enforced sporting isolation, South Africa used home advantage so well that the debutants reached the World Cup final. The sporting, political and human drama was told in John Carlin's book ""Nelson Mandela and the Game That Made a Nation"" and was made into the movie ""Invictus,"" with Morgan Freeman playing Mandela. Carlin tells the story of the moment on the day of the final when white South Africans took a man they once considered a terrorist into their hearts. ""The day's crowning moment came before the game had even begun, when Mandela went out onto the field, before a crowd of 65,000 that was 95% white, wearing the green Springbok jersey, the old symbol of oppression, beloved of his apartheid jailers,"" he wrote. ""There was a moment of jaw-dropping disbelief, a sharp collective intake of breath, and suddenly the crowd broke into a chant, which grew steadily louder, of 'Nelson! Nelson! Nelson!'"" Two hours later, the day's images adopted iconic status as the ""Rainbow Nation"" beat New Zealand to win the tournament, precipitating widespread celebrations, increased harmony and a mixture of both pride and hope to a South Africa in desperate need of reconciliation. The photo of team captain Francois Pienaar receiving the trophy from Mandela, who was wearing the No. 6 jersey associated with the Springboks' Afrikaner skipper, now takes a place of pride at the Apartheid Museum in Johannesburg. Nonetheless, Dr. Ashwin Desai, a university lecturer, sociologist and specialist in South Africa's racial history, believes that the impact of the moment was short-lived and began to crumble within a few months of the final. ""The Rainbow Nation and Mandela's legacy was supposed to be about the erosion of racial categories, but that has not happened,"" said Desai. ""This idea that sport can harmonize a nation is a cliché that South Africans use -- but we also know that sport can divide. The kindest thing to say about the dream of the Rainbow Nation is that it has been deferred -- more realistically though, the dream has been shattered. What we have now is deepening racial division, with racial categories being pre-eminent again."" Yet one of the most celebrated pages in modern race relations would never have been written had Mandela not saved the Springbok emblem, which was labeled ""deeply offensive"" by the National Sport Council in the mid-1990s because of its use in the racially divisive past. Recognizing that whites had lost both their national flag and the elevated status of their national anthem, Mandela understood their need to retain some identity -- and so the pacifier persuaded his colleagues that the Springboks' survival was key to building the new South Africa. Mandela won the argument despite the Springboks' history of breaking the international sporting ban that the ANC had successfully forced on many South African teams during apartheid. Even though he had backed the boycott from his prison cell on Robben Island, Mandela was aware of the sacrifices imposed on his nation's best sportsmen. ""I wanted my people to know that I became president sooner because of the sacrifices made by our athletes during the years of the boycott,"" he replied when asked why he was at a soccer match involving South Africa, rather than a politically themed event, shortly after his inauguration in May 1994. Two years later, Mandela and South Africa repeated the trick -- this time with soccer, the game that was the main preserve of the country's black community. With Mandela now draped in the football jersey, South Africa used home soil to win the Africa Cup of Nations, the continent's premier football event, at the first time of asking. Yet Mandela's true football legacy came when South Africa was awarded the honor of staging the 2010 World Cup finals, beating favorites Morocco 14-10 in the final vote. ""The presence of Mandela when we were making our bid was very, very powerful,"" said Desai. ""We were up against some big, powerful nations, such as Morocco and Egypt, so to beat off Morocco meant there had to be an extra player on the team -- and certainly the major game-changer was Mandela."" ""It is thanks to Mandela that the world could finally trust us to deliver this event at a world class level,"" Danny Jordaan told the FIFA website. ""He gave us a momentum and self-belief that we could achieve what many thought was impossible and we, and this country, will be forever grateful."" Despite a personal tragedy on the eve of the finals -- his great-granddaughter Zenani, 13, died in a car crash -- Mandela was ultimately rewarded with a tournament that shone with color, originality and, to widespread surprise outside South Africa, fine organization. Within Africa, many said they felt an increased sense of belonging as the football World Cup, which dates back to 1930, finally arrived in Africa -- the first time the continent had hosted a global event on the scale of the Olympics. FIFA President Sepp Blatter hailed Mandela as an ""extraordinary person"" on Thursday and recalled the ecstatic scenes at the 2010 World Cup's closing ceremony in what proved to be Mandela's final public appearance. ""When he was honored and cheered by the crowd at Johannesburg's Soccer City stadium on 11 July 2010, it was as a man of the people, a man of their hearts, and it was one of the most moving moments I have ever experienced. For him, the World Cup in South Africa truly was 'a dream come true,'"" Blatter said in a statement on FIFA's website. ""Nelson Mandela will stay in our hearts forever. The memories of his remarkable fight against oppression, his incredible charisma and his positive values will live on in us and with us."" Former South African international, Lucas Radebe also paid a moving tribute. ""The sports history books in South Africa will show statistics and victories. What they won't show, however, was that it was Madiba Magic that forged those results and performances; and united a country and its people along the way. No doubt, that Madiba Magic will live on. Thank you Tata,"" Radebe wrote on his website. This sense of belonging is one that Mandela maintained with his foundation, the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund, which started the Sport for Good program with the aim of using sport as a way of improving the lives of children in both South Africa and Swaziland. This sporting philosophy had served Mandela himself exceptionally well during his time in prison. In his biography, ""A Long Walk to Freedom,"" he explained how he followed a highly disciplined exercise regime in a bid to stay both physically and mentally healthy. ""I have always believed that exercise is a key not only to physical health, but to peace of mind,"" wrote the once-keen boxer and long-distance runner. ""Exercise dissipates tension, and tension is the enemy of serenity."" ""In prison, having an outlet for my frustrations was absolutely essential. Even on the island, I attempted to follow my old boxing routine of doing roadwork and muscle-building from Monday to Thursday and then resting for the next three days."" The efficacy of his discipline -- which also included 45 minutes of running ""on the spot in my cell"" and extensive anaerobic exercise four times a week -- was clear to see in the energy he brought to life as a free man -- keeping together the fragile, new South Africa, visiting world leaders and becoming one of the political icons of our time. After 27 years behind bars, where he was allowed just one visitor a year, perhaps it was only fair that the world then came to visit Mandela in later years -- with Pele, Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, Alex Ferguson, Tiger Woods and David Beckham prominent among the sporting luminaries to meet the icon. Like the wider world, sport is unlikely to forget Mandela, not just because of the tournaments and stadiums already named in his honor, but primarily for a day in 1995 when the anti-apartheid activist stole the show during the defeat of a team called, ironically enough, the All Blacks.

"(CNN)Holding onto the rails of a cage, we descend lower and lower into the coal mine. It is pitch dark, hot and humid. Every now and then a spray of water drizzles on us. The two-minute ride down seems much longer than that. Once we reach the bottom of the shaft, we begin a 3.5 kilometer walk underground to the site where miners are excavating coal. For almost an hour, we trudge through the slush, the light from our safety helmets the only illumination underground. Our protective clothes and faces quickly develop a black layer of coal dust. Coal is a polluting fossil fuel, which currently powers more than 60% of India. The government produced 462 million tonnes of it last year and is targeting a billion tonnes by 2019. Typically, the coal that burns in power plants across India is of poor quality, therefore more harmful. India is already the world's third highest emitter of greenhouse gases. So why is India so hungry for coal? Coal is abundantly available in India, which has the world's fifth largest reserves. That's still not enough to feed the country's hunger for the fuel. Rapid industrialization and rising demands from the power sector are primarily leading to coal shortages, says Leena Srivastava, an analyst at the Energy and Resources Institute in New Delhi. India resorts to imports to plug the gaps. For the current financial year, national demand for thermal coal to produce energy has been estimated at 551.6 million tonnes, authorities say. Of it, at least 84.7 million tonnes is being met through imports, coal minister Piyush Goyal told the Indian parliament in December. The state-run monopoly Coal India Limited (CIL) accounts for more than 80% of the output. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's plans for future privatization of this crucial industry faced resistance recently, when CIL workers stopped work in January. The two-day strike -- the biggest of its kind in four decades -- not only severely limited the ability of the companies to meet their production quotas, but forced the government to go slow on reforms. Around 300 million Indians still live in darkness, without access to electricity. That's the entire population of the United States. Coal remains an economical way to provide power, a cheaper fuel than several other sources. For now. Aware of international pressure to reduce its greenhouse gases, India is trying to ramp up alternative energy options. Blessed with months of sunlight, it's giving solar energy a big push. The current government has announced plans to produce 100 gigawatts of solar energy by 2022. Compared with the three gigawatts India produced last year, it seems ambitious. But Anand Prabhu Pathanjali, a renewable energy campaigner for Greenpeace India, believes it can be done. ""By making the policy regulations more  transparent and increasing investments on infrastructure this megafigure of 100GW can definitely be pulled off,"" he says. However, in order for it to happen, policy makers, regulators, solar companies, roof-top owners and off-grid users must cooperate. India is also moving ahead with a civil nuclear deal with the United States. Progress was made when U.S. President Barack Obama visited New Delhi last month but it will take years for nuclear energy to power India in a significant way. It's a balancing act for Modi, who has to manage international pressure regarding climate change on the one hand, and domestic pressure at home to illuminate lives and homes in India. Deep underground, miners work around the clock, seven days a week to power the country. It's hoped in the future, newer, greener technology will be in place to spare the environment and share the load.","India has the world's fifth largest coal reserves, but not enough to feed demand for fuel .

"(CNN)The vast majority of airport employees with direct access to the tarmac and airplanes do not go through any daily security screening, and only two of the country's major airports have systems in place that require all employees with secure access to pass through metal detectors, a CNN investigation has found. CNN was given exclusive access to one of those, Miami International Airport, and on a recent afternoon, employees lined up at a checkpoint where they passed through a metal detector as they reported to work. They gathered their belongings, swiped their badges and opened a door that leads down to the airport's secure ramp area. ""One of the greatest vulnerabilities for this airport and probably any other major airport like MIA is the insider threat,"" Lauren Stover, the airport's security director told CNN. Miami has four checkpoints for employee screening, five vehicle access gates manned by airport workers, random background checks of employees and a mandatory security awareness class for all employees among a myriad of other security measures. The only other major airport that conducts full employee screenings is Orlando, Florida, according to interviews with aviation officials. There is no federal requirement that the baggage handlers, mechanics, cleaning crews and other employees with access to the airfield and other secure areas get screened as passengers do. They are typically subject to a criminal background check and might get randomly screened while at work. By contrast, those who work at the gates, such as restaurant employees, pass through TSA security checkpoints. It's an issue that will be discussed on Tuesday at a hearing of a House Homeland Security subcommittee and follows a high-profile case in Atlanta. Federal agents broke up a gun smuggling operation at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in December, arresting a Delta baggage handler and passenger. The baggage handler brought the guns to work, entered the gate area and passed the weapons onto a passenger who had already gone through security. The passenger transported guns on about 20 Delta flights from Atlanta to New York last year, according to the arrest affidavit. Atlanta, unlike Miami and Orlando, does not use metal detectors to screen workers with access to secure areas. A spokesperson told CNN, ""We have expanded random inspections and increased our police presence."" In addition, the general manager of Atlanta's airport is expected to announce security changes at the upcoming hearing, according to a source familiar with his testimony. Delta declined to discuss specifics, but a spokesman said ""safety and security are always Delta's top priority."" CNN contacted 20 major airports across the U.S. to ask about security protocols for the so-called ""back of the airport"" employees. A spokesperson for Seattle Tacoma International Airport said employees with access to restricted areas do not have to pass through metal detectors but do carry badges verified by biometric scanners. Representatives of other airports, such as Los Angeles International Airport, Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport and McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, said some employees with restricted access pass through metal detectors while others do not. ""Not all employees are required to go through metal detectors,"" Sgt. Karla Ortiz with the Los Angeles Airport Police told CNN. ""There are several layers of security that are in place and part of that is training everyone that we are all responsible in ensuring the safety of our airports."" Representatives from eight airports deferred CNN's questions on metal-detector screenings for employees to the Transportation Security Administration, which did not provide further information on the topic.  Logan International Airport in Boston, Philadelphia International Airport and George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston did not respond to CNN's repeated requests for comment. Even Miami's strict security protocol could be vulnerable, according to Stover. ""It's not 100 percent foolproof, and we know that people are going to exploit the vulnerabilities that they can find,"" she said. ""We're not just looking for terrorist activity. We have a range of threats."" Last year, the airport confiscated 209 employee ID badges for security violations. The airport has nearly 34,000 employees with ID badges, and 33,150 who have access to restricted areas. Airport police, emergency responders and federal law enforcement are the only ones who do not go through the checkpoints, Stover said.  Miami began screening all employees through checkpoints after a 1999 drug smuggling plot in which dozens of ramp and food workers were arrested. A 2007 firearm and drug smuggling case in Orlando's airport led to full employee screening as well. In response to the investigation of the smuggling that brought firearms from Atlanta to New York, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, called on the TSA to require all airline and airport employees to undergo physical screening every time they enter secure areas of airports. Schumer referred to the lack of physical screening as a ""gaping loophole in airport security"" in a letter addressed to TSA Acting Administrator Melvin Carraway. ""When guns, drugs, and even explosives are as easy to carry on board a plane as a neck pillow, then we have to seriously -- and immediately -- overhaul our airport security practices,"" Schumer said in January. In a statement, the TSA said it was ""taking these recent incidents very seriously and has taken immediate steps to enhance site security at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport and other major U.S. airports. ""TSA is implementing or considering a range of measures, including additional requirements for employee screening; conducting additional, randomized security countermeasures at employee access points; and introducing additional security patrols by TSA teams of law enforcement and screening professionals to specifically address these concerns. ""Additionally, TSA has created a working group with representation from airport security partners to further develop plans for improving security."" The TSA identified workers with access to secure areas of airports as one of the greatest potential threats to aviation, according to a 2009 report by the Government Accountability Office. The report said costs for full screening of airport and airline employees could range from $5.7 billion to $14.9 billion for the first year of implementation. The entire TSA budget for 2015 is $7.3 billion. Wayne Black, a Miami-based security expert told CNN, ""We have a saying in our business: Budget driven security will always fail. ""You don't have to be a security expert -- a fifth-grader can tell you if you are checking at the top end, at the front end of the airport, you've got to be checking the back end of the airport,"" he said.

"While the nation waits to see whether the 1965 Voting Rights Act will be dismantled by the U.S. Supreme Court, it is worth reviewing how the act affected one group that had long opposed black suffrage: Southern white politicians . Before 1965, many white officeholders helped build their career by preventing blacks from voting. They could easily ignore black citizens.  In the very first primary election after passage of the Voting Rights Act, that began to change. In Alabama in 1966, Lurleen Wallace was standing in for her husband, George Wallace, who was unable to run again because of term limits. She faced a challenge from Attorney General Richmond Flowers, the first Democrat to seek black votes. If elected, he promised to remove the Confederate flag that flew atop the State Capitol and delete the words ""White Supremacy"" from the party emblem. Flowers campaigned mostly in black communities and joined in singing ""We Shall Overcome."" In return, he received the support of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Alabama's two largest black political groups, the Confederation of Alabama Political Organizations and the Alabama Democratic Conference, groups shunned by white candidates. Other candidates, once intensely racist, surprisingly followed Flowers' lead. Al Lingo -- head of Alabama's State Troopers and one of the architects of Bloody Sunday, the assault on Selma-to-Mongomery marchers on March 7, 1965, by state troopers and deputies -- sought black votes in his race for Jefferson County sheriff. ""I want the support of everybody, white or colored,"" he said. As for Bloody Sunday, he claimed that he had wanted to let the marchers proceed, but the governor overruled him, making him the ""scapegoat"" for what occurred. If elected, he promised that the sheriff's office would include black deputies. Even more startling was the behavior of Jim Clark, Sheriff of Dallas County, who was seeking re-election. Just the year before, Clark had treated African-Americans seeking the right to vote in Selma with unparalleled savagery and led the Bloody Sunday assault. Now he attempted to woo black voters. On April 24, he invited them to join him at a picnic where beer and barbecue were served. Turnout was disappointing. ""A man can't beat us in 1964 and 1965 and expect us to vote for him in 1966,"" noted one black leader. Because black votes now counted, reporters covering the campaign noted that the n-word, once a political staple, had disappeared. George Wallace, accustomed to saying ""Nigra,"" now struggled to remember that it should be pronounced ""Negro."" While Lurleen Wallace won an overwhelming victory on Election Day, Lingo received less than one-tenth of the number of votes cast for his opponent. Clark, facing defeat, attempted to steal his election, but he was blocked by Assistant Attorney General John Doar, who took him to court in the first lawsuit brought under the Voting Rights Act. Clark lost in court, ending his long reign of terror in Alabama. The 1966 Alabama primary was a preview of what was to come. In the years that followed, George Wallace apologized for his earlier racist views and sought the support of black voters. But perhaps more important -- and more striking -- was the evolution of South Carolina's Strom Thurmond, who had opposed the Voting Rights Act in 1965 and its renewal in 1970 and 1975. In 1982, civil rights activists worried that Thurmond would use his power as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee to kill the act's reauthorization. Thurmond's opposition to integration went back decades. In 1948, Harry Truman's civil rights programs had led Thurmond to bolt the Democratic National Convention and run for president as a ""Dixiecrat."" As a senator, Thurmond launched a historic filibuster against the 1957 Civil Rights Act and denounced the 1964 Civil Rights Act as ""vicious."" That same year Thurmond became a Republican and supported Barry Goldwater for president, beginning the political transformation of the South from staunchly Democratic to reliably Republican. By 1982, 30% of the voters in Thurmond's state were black, leaving the senator little choice but to vote for the act. In doing so, he said that he did not want to fall victim to ""the common perception that a vote against the bill indicates opposition to the right to vote and, indeed, opposition to the group of citizens who are protected under the Voting Rights Act."" Or, as he earlier told a racist colleague who lost a campaign for governor of South Carolina, ""we can't win elections any more by cussin' Nigras."" The Voting Rights Act had succeeded in doing what it was created to do: create millions of new black voters, and -- less understood -- free white Southern politicians from always opposing black gains. There is no better example of democracy in action. In 2006, not a single senator from a state covered by the Voting Rights Act voted against its renewal. Should the Supreme Court now significantly weaken the protection of minority voting that the act provides, we may well return to a time when ""cussin' Nigras"" is again a politically acceptable strategy.","Gary May: Court to consider 1965's Voting Rights Act provision .

"A city defined by the natural contours of the land, hugging the sea and pinpricked by rocky outcrops, Helsinki has been planned to fit around the landscape. This year, this mini metropolis has proven it's creative credentials in all aspects of urban life. The Finnish capital has gained hugely from a shake up in the city planning department. New arrangements have changed the dynamic -- such as old railway tracks being converted into a pedestrian cycling route. Any fuss about old statues being overshadowed by contemporary architecture clearly belongs to the old order.

Between two of the city's main shopping malls, and the iconic 1930's Lasipalatsi building, this circular wooden structure is a surprisingly bold architectural statement in one of the busiest parts of Helsinki. Designed by the studio K25 (consisting of three young architects) the awarded building is a site for meditation, its plain minimalist form inviting quiet reflection. Made out of Finnish timber, the design shows great sensibility for the use of local materials. Without side windows light falls from above through an oval gap around the ceiling, creating a sense of calmness. The chapel demonstrates how contemporary architecture at its best can fascinate and inspire. It is one of the true centerpieces of the WDC 2012 program. Simonkatu 7, Helsinki. Opening hours: 7 am to 8 pm on weekdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekends . 2. Musiikkitalo . The new concert venue and music academy, occupies a site between three of the city's architectural monuments. On the opposite side of Mannerheinintie stands the Parliament House in neoclassical style, to the north lies Aalto's Finlandia Hall from 1970s and across the lawn to the south shines Steven Holl's Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art. As most new buildings it has divided opinions. The architecture was criticized for not being bold enough, perhaps not living up to the expectations imposed by its neighboring buildings. However, the interior has great spatial rhythm with seven halls in different sizes, descending below the ground level. The largest hall follows a vineyard shape design, where musicians are surrounded by the audience and a row of windows allows daylight into the space  when left uncovered. The program is a combination of classical and popular music. One of the autumn highlights has been Tristan and Isolde conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen and presented in collaboration with visual artist Bill Viola. World-class orchestras such as Berlin and Vienna Philharmonics have also been scheduled to perform in the main hall renowned for its exceptional acoustics. Mannerheimintie 13 A, Helsinki 00010 . 3. Mattolaituri . A short stroll from the South Harbor, this cafe has become one of the most popular spots along the seafront for a coffee break and for drinks on warm summer evenings. Opened last year it also embodies the innovative attitude of the new city planning department. The long coastline has recently been enlivened by new cafes and industrial harbor sites are being redeveloped. In the smart Kaivopuisto neighborhood, Mattolaituri occupies a beautiful site previously allocated for washing rugs in the seawater, hence the name ""rug quay."" The atmosphere is relaxed and the tipple of choice seems to be bubbly, with an unusually large selection of Cava and Champagne for a seaside cafe. Tapas style snacks sandwiches and pastries are also served. Ehrenströmintie 3 A, 00140 Helsinki . 4. Galerie Forsblom . Since moving into new premises last year, Galerie Forsblom has established itself as the largest gallery dealing in contemporary art in Scandinavia. Despite its imposing scale, the gallery has a welcoming Nordic feel with whitewashed wooden floors and daylight falling through the ceiling in the main hall. And just one block away from Stockmann department store. Designed by Gluckman Mayner, Forsblom relied on the New York based architects' expertise with exhibition spaces, seen in earlier commissions from big American art institutions and galleries such as Larry Gagosian. In Helsinki, Gluckman Mayner  conjured an airy gallery out of an old office block, where Forsblom will showcase some of the best in Finnish art and design during the WDC year. Lönnrotinkatu 5, 00120 Helsinki . Recommended by Susanna Petterson, director of the Alvar Aalto Foundation: the best places for a stopover in Helsinki. CAFE ENGEL, Aleksanterinkatu 26, 00170 Helsinki . ""A great spot for admiring the surrounding architecture over coffee and cakes."" Opposite Tuomiokirkko Cathedral, this cafe is housed in one of the oldest buildings around Senaatintori square. The facade was designed by C L Engel, whose neoclassical buildings adorn the square. The cafe is a popular place for lunch amongst locals from the nearby university buildings. LASIPALATSI, Mannerheimintie 22-24, 00100 Helsinki . ""An example of 1930's functionalist architecture with many cafes and a restaurant offering Finnish style cuisine."" Lasipalatsi, originally built as an office building, is close to the Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art and the Kamppi Chapel. Also a cinema and Eat&Joy Maatilatori, a store for local and organic produce, can be found here. CAFE  AALTO, Akateeminen, Pohjoisesplanadi 39, 00100 Helsinki . ""Designed by Aalto in the 1960's this cafe is a unique place in the heart of the city. It is run by the same family as Cafe Engel."" Located on the second floor of the Akateeminen bookstore, the cafe represents Aalto's later design approach with wall surfaces in light marble. A serene environment for coffee or a light lunch.","The Finnish capital is the World Design Capital 2012 .

"(CNN)Gov. Chris Christie canceled three scheduled media appearances with reporters in London on Tuesday, less than 24 hours after the New Jersey Republican made controversial comments about vaccinations and after a new report revealed lavish travel by Christie that was paid for by others. ""We're just not having a gaggle today,"" Christie's spokeswoman, Maria Comella, told reporters without giving a reason. Christie was scheduled to make remarks to the press after having lunch with British Chancellor George Osborne, but he did not come to the microphones. ""We had a lot of fun,"" Christie said as reporters shouted questions at him. He and his wife, Mary Pat, walked to a waiting car holding hands. The potential presidential contender, on the final leg of his three-day trip to the United Kingdom, also dodged questions after an event earlier in the day when he stopped by the Hope House, a drug and rehabilitation center that counts members of the royal family among its supporters. And he declined to talk after stopping by the Globe Theatre to watch Rutgers students rehearse William Shakespeare's ""Henry V."" When pressed by reporters, according to a Washington Post reporter, Christie responded,""Is there something you don't understand about 'No Questions'?"" A New York Times story Monday night disclosed new details about travel and gifts that Christie has accepted from foreign governments and wealthy donors, including a weekend trip paid for by King Abdullah of Jordan. And casino mogul Sheldon Adelson let Christie fly on his private plane to Israel in 2012, right around the time when Christie was facing a decision of whether to sign a bill legalizing online gambling in New Jersey. Christie's office said in the story that Adelson did not personally lobby Christie to veto the bill, and the governor ultimately decided to sign it, anyway. RELATED: Chris Christie sidesteps vaccine science . The story also takes a wider look at Christie's penchant for expensive travel and his history of hobnobbing with celebrities, despite portraying himself as a no frills, average guy from Jersey known for his blunt, candid personality that strays from the typical persona of a politician. Christie's acceptance of free travel from King Abdullah doesn't appear to break any laws. He signed an executive order in 2010 that allows New Jersey governors to travel at the cost of foreign governments. As for three parties that King Abdullah hosted for Christie during the trip, the governor's office cited a law to the New York Times that lets governors accept gifts from personal friends. Comella declined to dispute anything about the article when CNN asked her on Tuesday, saying she would not comment on it. The same law was referenced when Christie's expenses were covered by Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones to an NFL game last month in Dallas. RELATED: Measles outbreak: How bad is it? Christie also caused a stir Monday when he suggested that parents should have ""some measure of choice in things"" like vaccinating their children, describing it as a ""balance that the government has to decide."" The vaccination debate has seen renewed attention after the measles have seen a resurgence despite being declared eliminated in the U.S. by 2000. His comments, as well as those by some other potential presidential contenders Monday, stirred up a political firestorm over where Republicans and Democrats stand on the issue. Kevin Roberts, a spokesman for Christie, followed up in an email to reporters that Christie ""believes vaccines are an important public health protection and with a disease like measles there is no question kids should be vaccinated."" Christie is scheduled to stay in London until Wednesday morning but does not have any more public events.

"(CNN)Ivory Coast claimed its first Africa Cup of Nations title in 23 years after beating Ghana 9-8 in a dramatic penalty shootout in the final Sunday. The winning penalty was scored by Ivory Coast goalkeeper Boubacar Barry after he had saved the preceding effort from his Ghana counterpart Razak Braimah. It was almost a carbon copy of the 1992 final when the Ivorians beat Ghana on spot kicks after a goalless draw and extra time. The 35-year-old Barry, who replaced the injured Sylvain Ghobouo for the final, had been beset by cramp during the lengthy shootout, but mustered the energy to fire his kick past the unfortunate Braimah to spark wild celebrations by his team. Ghana had looked set to win its first AFCON crown since 1982 when it took a 2-0 lead in the shootout after Manchester City's new signing Wilfired Bony and teammate Tallo had failed to convert their kicks. But the Black Stars failed to take full advantage as Afriyie Acquah saw his effort saved by Barry and Frank Acheampong sent his effort wide. With all the remaining outfield players successful with their kicks, it was left to the respective goalkeepers to play out the final drama. The match in Bata in Equatorial Guinea was watched by the country's president Teodoro Obiang, FIFA president Sepp Blatter and Confederation of Africa Football (CAF) president Issa Hayatou. They saw a tactical affair which rarely reached the heights expected of a match between two powerhouses of African football, played in a stadium less than full. The Elephants of Ivory Coast made the better start but failed to forge a clear cut opening as the supply to star striker Bony was restricted. Ghana came closest to an opening as Christian Atsu's snap shot from the edge of the area rattled the post and late in the first half Andrew Ayew's effort clipped the outside of the near post. Further chances in the second half and during added times were again limited as both teams appeared to settle for the lottery of penalty kicks. The triumph is the second in three AFCON finals for Ivory Coast coach Herve Renard, who led Zambia to the 2012 title, ironically with Ivory Coast as the victims after a penalty shootout. Frenchman Renard, the first man to achieve this feat, understood what the triumph meant to the winning nation. ""We dedicate this win to the Ivorian people,"" he told gathered reporters. ""Football has this magic element in that it unites all the ethnic groups -- all the people who perhaps don't think the same way. ""Ivory Coast is more than delighted today and that's the most important thing."" His opposite Avram Grant also praised his beaten side, claiming that reach the final alone was a big achievement. ""We were the better team but we did not create enough chances... Ghana can be proud of this young team,"" said the former Chelsea manager.","Ivory Coast wins 2015 Africa Cup of Nations .

"(CNN)Katy Perry made our teenage dreams come true at the Super Bowl halftime show Sunday with dizzying pyrotechnics, dancing sharks and enough outfit changes to give Beyonce a run for her money. Expectations were mixed going into the show. Would she fall flat like the Patriots' footballs or take off like a firework? She had the support of well-wishers like ex Russell Brand, who promised baffled Brits that the halftime show would be ""amazing."" But really, we were just eager for a reprieve from the lackluster first half between the Seahawks and the Patriots. Regardless of whether you appreciated her artistry, the show delivered throughout on memorable (and meme-worthy) moments, from Perry's entrance atop a robot tiger, dressed in a suit of flames, until her exit on a star that drew comparisons to NBC's ""More You Know"" logo. Much of the credit goes to guest stars Lenny Kravitz and Missy Elliott, whom some deemed more worthy of the spotlight. First up was Kravitz, who joined in a duet of ""I Kissed A Girl."" People were excited if not somewhat confused by the pairing. Then, Perry transitioned to a tropical landscape of dancing beach balls, palm trees and sharks for ""California Girls,"" and everyone started wondering whether we were in a ""Teenage Dream"" or on a bad acid trip. Luckily, Snoop Dogg chimed in to assure us that yes, the landscape was real, and he knows because he was there. Then, Missy Elliott arrived to help Perry get her freak on, much to everyone's delight. Some would say she stole the show. But, the real kicker was her exit on a star that drew comparisons to NBC's famous ""more you know"" star. What's the verdict? Overall, most seemed to delight in roasting Perry, and were generally pleased that the show delivered enough moments to make into memes and objects of mockery. Our friends at HLN probably said it best: ""@katyperry's dancing sharks are the thing to beat this #SuperBowl Sunday.""","Social media delight in Katy Perry's halftime show .

"In 2010, the New York State Legislature passed a law raising taxes on cigarettes purchased in New York City to $5.85 per pack of 20 cigarettes. Fast-forward four years: A U.S. senator is blaming the politician that created that law for the chokehold death of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man, by a white police officer in New York City in July 2014. ""I do blame the politician,"" Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, explained on MSNBC's ""Hardball."" ""We put our police in a dangerous situation with bad laws."" Garner died after a police officer put him in a chokehold while trying to arrest him for selling tax-free cigarettes. The police officers at the time were unaware of Garner's pre-existing health conditions that likely helped lead to his death. On Wednesday, Paul said Garner's death would have been prevented if the law creating New York City's high cigarette taxes -- the highest in the country -- wasn't created. ""I think it's also important to know that some politician put a tax of $5.85 on a pack of cigarettes,"" Paul said. ""So they've driven cigarettes underground so as not to make them so expensive."" The likely Republican presidential hopeful continued, ""But then some politician also had to direct the police to say, 'Hey, we want you arresting people for selling a loose cigarette.' And for someone to die over you know breaking that law -- there really is no excuse for it.""","Sen. Rand Paul blames New York City's high cigarette taxes for Eric Garner's death .

"""Everything secret degenerates, even the administration of justice; nothing is safe that cannot bear discussion and publicity."" -- Lord Acton . The recent disclosures about the National Security Agency's massive and aggressive spying on the world, including U.S. citizens, along with other scandals showing Associated Press and Fox News reporters targeted in ""leak"" investigations, should make us realize that John Poindexter's plan for ""Total Information Awareness"" never died: It merely went underground and changed its name. When the TIA idea was first proposed by the Bush administration after 9/11, along with a ""Big Brother"" all-seeing eye logo, it was widely considered a crazy notion, resulting in an outcry. That data collection plan, which involved indiscriminate spying on Americans, was quickly squelched -- at least publicly. The truth, however, was that it was reborn under dozens of massive data collection and surveillance programs within each of our 16 highly secretive intelligence agencies, under a variety of cute acronyms. These programs falsely purport to get ""novel intelligence from massive data."" (In fact, NIMD is the actual, self-explanatory name of one such program). Few within the national intelligence community complained about the wrongfulness, illegality or ineffectiveness -- let alone the waste and fraud -- of programs that create billions in profit for private surveillance contractors, technology experts and intelligence operatives and analysts. But there's no evidence the NIMD theory has worked.  Researchers long ago concluded that the NIMD-type promise of detecting and accurately stopping terrorists through massive data collection was simply not possible. Opinion: Edward Snowden is a hero . Think about how Bush administration officials defended themselves from not following up on the incredibly specific intelligence warnings urgently going to Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet and National Counterterrorism Director Richard Clark in the months leading up to 9/11. Their common response back then was something along the line of: intelligence is like a fire hose, and you can't get a sip from a fire hose. There was apparently too much for top officials to even read the key memos addressed to them. But if intelligence was a fire hose before 9/11, it quickly became Niagara Falls. And now, with so much data (almost all of it irrelevant) that has been sucked into government databases and computers, one might liken the ""intelligence flow"" to a tsunami, with analysts asked to find just the right drop of water. Good luck. In fact, The Washington Post's well-researched series in 2010 on ""Top Secret America"" reported that the NSA was collecting and storing around 1.7 billion pieces of information every 24 hours, even back then. To switch metaphors, it does not make it easier to find a needle in a haystack if you continue to add hay.  No one has ever explained why it was left to fellow passengers or alert street vendors, not the ""intelligence"" agencies, to stop the last four major terrorist attacks or attempted attacks on U.S. soil. When the Bush administration's illegal monitoring was revealed by The New York Times in December 2005, a cover-up of sorts ensued.  By labeling it the ""terrorist surveillance program,"" Bush and his closest intelligence officials scared Congress and the people into believing that the surveillance was something other than a dragnet -- that it was limited to terrorist suspects, or at least to foreign nationals, and did not encompass all Americans.  Few believed at the time that such a colossal secret system could eventually be used against American news agencies and reporters, activists and other officials. Fast forward to President Barack Obama's response to the recent confirmation about the extent of the NSA's ""metadata"" collection of our telephone and Internet information. Keep in mind that the NSA is just one of the 16 agencies involved in data gathering and storage. Opinion: Your biggest secrets are up for grabs . A courageous person of conscience -- Edward Snowden -- has now openly confirmed it all but is already suffering official demonization because he felt it important for the wider public to know and debate the magnitude and reach of the U.S. government's secret monitoring. The disclosures have caused Obama and other officials to more or less admit that massive government surveillance erodes citizens' individual privacy, but they claim that it is a necessary trade-off in the quest for security.  Omitted was proof that such a strategy even works. The excessive secrecy and increasing compartmentalization in ""top secret America"" actually reduces information sharing, which the post 9/11 investigations concluded was the major failure and root cause that allowed the 9/11 attacks to occur. Some of us even wonder if the 9/11 attacks could have been prevented if WikiLeaks or a similar channel had existed to get out the serious threats and information that surfaced in the months beforehand but were ignored, unread or became blocked in the ""fire hose."" Secretive spying programs actually harm national security.  And arguably worse, they pose, as Snowden stated, ""an existential threat to democracy."" The Bill of Rights limits government prerogative by ensuring that a measure of evidence and proof are necessary before police can detain people or search their homes and other areas of privacy. The threat to democracy lies not only in the evisceration of the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of unreasonable searches and the Fifth Amendment's guarantee of due process, right against self-incrimination and coerced confessions and other rights that form the backbone of the criminal justice system, but also in eroding freedom of the press, seeing journalists and reporters as ""aiding and abetting"" the criminal telling of government secrets. Secrets, by the way, that shouldn't even be secret. Few graphs climb as sharply upward as this one tracing the line from 6 million government documents classified ""secret"" in 1996 to 92 million secret in 2011. What will be the figure in 2013?  Will we need someone such as Snowden to tell us? Has Thomas Jefferson's notion that the bedrock of democracy rests on an informed citizenry become as ""quaint"" as the Geneva Conventions? The notion that we must choose between abiding by the Constitution and improving security is fundamentally false, as Obama noted when first campaigning for the presidency. But his recent response was a flip flop exploiting people's fear of terrorism to say he cannot ensure their ""100% security"" unless people give up their privacy and convenience to allow the massive NSA monitoring.  A lot more than privacy and convenience is at stake. What is at risk here is simply the rule of law, whose keystone is the concept of due process, as derived from the Magna Carta and enshrined in the Bill of Rights. Once due process goes, we can wave goodbye also to freedom of speech, freedom of press and freedom of assembly. Opinion: Why we need government surveillance . It has happened before. One need to only look to the operation of the House Un-American Activities Committee in the late 1940s and '50s to recall a time when rights were suspended and to be accused meant to be convicted of a thought crime. Often considered the smartest man of the last century, Albert Einstein died with a nearly 2,000 page FBI file. J. Edgar Hoover gathered secret information on anyone and everyone of consequence, which gave him power over some presidents. In the 1960s, the FBI's COINTELPRO (counter-intelligence program) secretly monitored civil rights, anti-war and even feminist groups. Hoover's ""black bag jobs"" against such public activists as Martin Luther King Jr., secret blackmailing attempts and nonjudicial ""disruption"" of these groups is what actually led to the Church Committee investigation of abuses and the creation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which the NSA has now effectively dismantled. Who wants to go back to the good ole' HUAC-Hoover era? I'm afraid that secrecy will inherently continue to degenerate everything and everybody it touches. Thank goodness for some persons of conscience such as Edward Snowden and for a little truth getting out!","Coleen Rowley: Surveillance programs create huge profit for private contractors .

"(CNN)A Southern California day care has shut down because an infant there -- who's too young to get vaccinated -- contracted measles, another case in the re-emergence of the disease on the West Coast. The Samohi Infant Toddler Center inside Santa Monica High School, a facility for 24 young children of students and staff members, closed Monday after it was learned that a baby under 12 months old being care for there had measles. It's not clear when, where or how the child got the disease. Nor is there any timetable for when the center will reopen, but it's possible that children who have been immunized against the highly contagious virus could soon go back. In addition to the baby with measles, 13 other infants who went to the day care center are being quarantined for 21 days as a safeguard. ""It's the best thing to do to protect the babies and the community,"" Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District spokeswoman Gail Pinsker said of the closure. ""It's a tough situation."" For all the talk about vaccination and measles, in one respect it's irrelevant in this case: Children shouldn't get the first dose until 12 through 15 months of age, with the second dose coming when they are between 4 and 6 years old, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Then again, the fact that infants aren't vaccinated makes them even more vulnerable -- especially at a time when more and more measles cases are popping up daily in Southern California. So far, this latest case hasn't affected the rest of Santa Monica High School or its 3,100-plus students, beyond the three teenage mothers with children who go to the day care center. An assistant baseball coach (who didn't teach at the school) contracted the disease weeks ago, but he's since returned with a clean bill of health. According to the school district, 11.5% of all Santa Monica and Malibu students have not been immunized because their parents opted out. This is legal in California, but controversial -- with some, including medical professionals, saying that vaccinations are a safe, effective and necessary means to prevent the spread of diseases like measles. Measles starts with a fever, runny nose, cough, red eyes and sore throat. For most people, it doesn't get much worse than that -- and yet one out of every 20 children with measles also contract pneumonia, and one or two out of every 1,000 children with the disease die from it, according to the CDC. While once widespread in the United States, cases dropped significantly thanks to vaccines. In 2000, health authorities declared that measles had been eliminated in the United States, which meant it was no longer native to the United States but continued to be brought in by international travelers. But that doesn't mean no one has gotten it since. Last year, the United States had its most number of measles cases -- at 644 -- since 2000, the CDC reported on its website. And in the first month of this year alone, 102 people reportedly had come down with the disease. Measles outbreak: How bad is it? Those cases were reported in 14 states, but the vast majority were in California. The Golden State alone had 92 new cases since December, most of those tied to an outbreak at Disneyland, according to the state's public health department. Most of the 59 people originally affected were park employees and patrons. Those numbers are one of the reasons California has been at the epicenter of this story, but not the only one. Another has to do with vaccinations. California allows exemptions from vaccinations for medical reasons and ""personal beliefs,"" and parents have been using them. Over the last school year, 3.3% of California kindergartners -- about 18,200 -- were allowed to skip their shots, according to the CDC. Schools are encouraged to have ""an up-to-date list of pupils with exemptions, so they can be excluded quickly if an outbreak occurs,"" the California Department of Public Health says.

CNN's Traci Tamura, Steve Almasy and Stella Chan contributed to this report.","Santa Monica day care shuts down because a baby who goes there has measles .

"Atlanta (CNN)Two days after she was found facedown and unresponsive in a bathtub full of water at her Roswell, Georgia, home, Whitney Houston's daughter Bobbi Kristina Brown is on a ventilator and in intensive care, a source close to the family said. Brown, 21, was placed in a medically induced coma and the status of her brain function won't be known until the sedatives are reduced, the source told CNN. ""Bobbi Kristina is fighting for her life and is surrounded by immediate family. As her father already stated, we are asking you to honor our request for privacy during this difficult time,"" the Houston family said, thanking her supporters. The source close to the family told CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin that Brown's eyes opened and closed a few times Monday, but that doctors told family members not to read too much into that movement. Doctors were trying to reduce the sedatives to check Brown's brain function, but decided not to and to keep her in the coma for now, the source said. The source added that Brown had some seizures on Monday. Bobbi Kristina, in her own words . She ""was not breathing"" when a man identified as her husband found her Saturday morning inside her townhouse in the Atlanta suburb. He called 911 and performed CPR until emergency crews arrived and took over, said police spokeswoman Lisa Holland. The spokeswoman said when Brown was found, she was ""unresponsive, meaning not breathing, no heartbeat."" In scanner traffic, emergency services could be heard describing an ""ECHO-level response"" -- urgent and life threatening -- with ""possible cardiac arrest."" ""Twenty-one-year-old female in the bathtub, facedown.  PD's (police department's) en route."" Brown was taken to a local hospital, where ""she is still alive and breathing. Other than that, I don't know her condition,"" Holland said over the weekend. A source close to the family told CNN contributor Nischelle Turner on Monday that Brown is in ""really bad shape."" Everyone is ""hoping for the best, preparing for the worst,"" and ""praying for a miracle,"" the source said. Nobody knows what caused Brown's unresponsiveness, Holland said, but police consider it a medical incident at this time. She said investigators had found nothing to indicate it was drug- or alcohol-related. The incident report referenced a drowning. Police had been to Bobbi Kristina Brown's residence recently. Somebody reported a fight there January 23, but nobody answered the door and officers found no evidence of an altercation, Holland said. Almost three years ago, Whitney Houston was found dead in a bathtub at the Beverly Hilton hotel near Los Angeles, hours before she was to attend a pre-Grammy Awards party. A coroner ruled her February 11, 2012, death an accidental drowning, with heart disease and cocaine use listed as contributing factors. Brown is her only child. ""She encourages me and inspires me,"" Houston once said of her daughter. ""When I look at her eyes and I see myself, I go, 'OK. I can do this. I can do this.'"" Brown was born in 1993 during Houston's marriage to R&B singer Bobby Brown, which ended in divorce in 2007. The daughter of music royalty became a public figure during the mid-2000s reality show ""Being Bobby Brown,"" in which she frequently appeared alongside her parents and often had a front-row seat to their marital fireworks. Bobby Brown requested privacy in a statement issued Sunday by his lawyer, who said that Brown was at the hospital with his daughter. ""Please allow for my family to deal with this matter and give my daughter the love and support she needs at this time,"" Bobby Brown said. Mother and daughter performed together on national TV in 2009, when the two sang ""My Love Is Your Love"" in Central Park on ABC's ""Good Morning America."" Given the pair's close relationship, it's no surprise that Houston's death was a major blow. Days after her mother's body was found, a grieving Bobbi Kristina -- then 18 -- was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center because she was ""overwhelmed,"" family friend Kim Burrell said. ""She loves hard,"" Burrell said then of Bobbi Kristina. ""She's going to be OK, and we're going to see to it."" After Houston's death, Bobbi Kristina talked of pursuing a career in acting and music, just like her mother. In 2012, she reportedly lobbied for a role in a planned biopic of her mother's life. Lifetime's ""Whitney,"" which was directed by actress Angela Bassett, debuted in January 2015, but the Houston family was not involved. Brown did make her acting debut in 2012 on Tyler Perry's TBS show ""For Better or Worse."" Her performance in the small role won praise from Perry. ""She did a fantastic job,"" he said at the time. ""And that kid has a such a future. She's such an actor. "" Even before her famous mother's death, videos of Brown singing surfaced on You Tube and were quickly criticized by fans who felt her talent did not live up to Houston's. Concerns that she may have substance abuse issues, as her mother did, intensified in July 2014 after a picture was posted on her Instagram account showing a young woman who looked like Brown appearing to be smoking from a bong. The caption read: ""This picture may be inappropriate but I want to make a connection with you all. Don't worry this picture isn't recent just hear me out. Do you know what I feel? I feel strange I can't feel any pain anymore. I don't take any drugs as of recently. Things just happened. But then there is some situation that force me to do things and the impact I'll feel pain. I did and I do. I was hurt."" Brown later denied that she posted the photo and tweeted that it was done by someone attempting to tarnish her image. Brown appeared on episodes of Lifetime's brief reality show ""The Houstons: On Our Own,"" which followed her life after Houston's death. One of the show's storylines revolved around Brown's relationship with Nick Gordon, who had lived with Houston and her daughter since he was 12 years old. Brown reportedly got engaged to Gordon, and in January 2014, she tweeted out a picture of wedding rings, presumably belonging to her and Gordon, along with the words, #HappilyMarried• SO#Inlove."" ""(Houston) made me promise several times to look after Krissy ... and, Mom, I will never ever, ever break that promise,"" Gordon told the entertainment show ""Extra"" afterward, saying Houston ""just treated me like she gave birth to me."" It was unclear whether Gordon came home Saturday morning to find Brown in the bathtub or if he had been in another part of the house overnight, Holland said. Police have obtained a search warrant to look through the house, but that's standard procedure, she said. Concern for Brown surged again after news broke.

"(CNN)There are tiring commutes. And then there's James Robertson's commute. The 56-year-old Detroit man walks 21 miles every weekday as part of his journey to and from the factory where he works. ""I never thought anything I did would garner this much attention,"" Robertson said. Robertson takes the bus some of the way, but for the past decade, ever since his car broke down, he has trudged the better part of a marathon each workday. Rain, snow or shine. After reading about Robertson's commute in a Detroit Free Press article from over the weekend, college student Evan Leedy was moved. Like Robertson, the 19-year-old lives and works in two counties, so he spends a great deal of time commuting himself. But Leedy has a car. Leedy decided to set up an online fundraiser to buy Robertson a new car. ""My first car cost $3,000,"" Leedy said, ""So I set the goal at $5,000. Within an hour, we'd raised $2,000."" Leedy's fundraiser on GoFundMe has blown past its original goal, reaching more than $257,000 by Tuesday evening. Robertson, in a video message posted on the Free Press website, gave thanks. ""Everybody calls me the inspiration, but to those who have been great enough to donate and everything ... it was really so welcome that I don't know what to tell you,"" he said. ""You guys are the heroes."" Comments on the page from people donating money suggested that the story of Robertson's dedication to getting to work had tapped into a deep well of public feeling. ""Thank you for inspiring me and hopefully tons of other people to persevere in the face of adversity,"" said a contributor by the name of Kevin LeMelle. ""You are a true American hero."" ""We could use more men like James Robertson in this world,"" wrote a donor named Betty Blanchard. Blake Pollack identifies with the strangers' words of support. He first spotted Robertson during his own work commute a year and a half ago. ""Climbing over snow banks, when it was pouring down rain in the summer,"" Pollack said, ""Whatever the weather, he was there."" Pollack approached Robertson, who told the financial executive his story.  Pollack promised to give him a ride the next time he saw him. ""Two to three months later, I saw him on a corner,"" Pollack remembered, ""And I asked if he needed a ride to work."" Pollack estimates he's given Robertson between 40 and 50 rides since then, and the two men from vastly different worlds have formed an unlikely friendship. The pleasure, Pollack said, has been all his. ""I'm the lucky one,"" Pollack said. ""Driving him around isn't a chore, it's a reward."" Pollack said Robertson is inspirational and funny, adding that his work ethic puts anyone to shame. ""I set our attendance standard by this man,"" Todd Wilson, plant manager at the engineering factory, told the newspaper. ""I say, if this man can get here, walking all those miles through snow and rain, well I'll tell you, I have people in Pontiac 10 minutes away and they say they can't get here -- bull!"" Robertson apparently has a perfect attendance record. He earns $10.55 an hour, not enough to save up to buy, insure and operate a car in the city, according to the newspaper. With the online donations now topping $200,000, Robertson, Pollack and Leedy met together for the first time Monday night. The overwhelming support has extended beyond money -- and several car dealerships have offered to give him a vehicle outright. ""Now that [the effort] is so big, there's so much more to think about,"" Leedy said. There are, unfortunately, people who want to take advantage of Robertson's newfound celebrity and his generosity, Pollack said. He put together a team that includes an attorney from a large law firm in Michigan, a CPA and a certified financial planner that he says will ensure the donation money is handled appropriately and in a way that best serves Robertson. ""This money that is being given to him -- he earned every penny of it,"" Leedy said, just by his work ethic and his attitude. He's been making the arduous 21-mile journey from Detroit to Rochester Hills since his 1988 Honda Accord gave up on him. The donations mean that Robertson's mode of transportation will likely soon be changing, and without the long commute, he'll probably be getting a lot more sleep. But he loves where he works, so he has no plans to change much else. ""I can't imagine not working,"" Robertson said. ""It's what I've always done."" Robertson, in his message, said he never expected as much support as he has received. He encouraged people to look out for one another. ""If this story will touch at least one person and inspire them to do something out of the goodness of their heart, I will be the happiest person alive,"" he said. CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report.","Detroit man thanks supporters .

"Another American doctor infected with the deadly Ebola virus has arrived home for treatment in the United States. A plane carrying Dr. Rick Sacra landed Friday morning in Omaha, Nebraska, and he was then was taken to Omaha's Nebraska Medical Center, center spokeswoman Jenny Nowatzke said. His doctors in Nebraska said they are treating him with ""aggressive supportive care,"" including fluids and electrolytes, and they are continuing to examine him to make sure nothing else is wrong. The doctors said they are exploring ""experimental options,"" calling on experts throughout the world to see what experimental therapeutics might work best and what treatment is ""most promising."" Sacra, the third American with Ebola to return to the United States for treatment, was stationed in Liberia when he was exposed to the virus. His wife, Debbie Sacra, said he was ""clearly sick"" but was in ""good spirits"" and was able to walk onto the plane in Liberia before the flight to Nebraska. ""We are really encouraged by that news and are looking forward to reuniting with him,"" she said. When Sacra's temperature went up, he sent the president of SIM, the aid organization he works for, an email that read: . ""To all of you at SIM, and to my colleagues here in Liberia at ELWA Hospital, I apologize,"" read a tearful Bruce Johnson, president of SIM USA. He went on to explain that Sacra is a humble man and would be embarrassed by the global media attention. He said Sacra was concerned that the attention on his case would disrupt broader patient care at ELWA Hospital in Liberia. The email went on to say: ""Regarding evacuation: I know and accept that there is no easy solution for an evacuation, so I don't expect one. Jesus is right here with me in Liberia!"" As soon as the physician was symptomatic, he was admitted locally to an Ebola case management center near a hospital in Monrovia where he has served for 15 years. ""Rick was receiving excellent care from our SIM/ELWA staff in Liberia at our Ebola 2 Care Center,"" Johnson said. ""They all love and admire him deeply. However, the Nebraska Medical Center provides advanced monitoring equipment and wider availability of treatment options."" What to know about the killer disease . Sacra, who is from Holden, Massachusetts, was not treating Ebola patients directly. Instead, he was delivering babies at a general hospital in Monrovia, Johnson said. ""I am surrounded by friends and family and the body of Christ, who are a great encouragement and who are praying fervently for Rick's recovery along with me,"" Debbie Sacra said in a statement. ""We are trusting in God to be with Rick and us through this difficult circumstance."" She will be traveling to Nebraska this weekend, Johnson said. ""Rick would want me to urge you to remember that there are many people in Liberia who are suffering in this epidemic and others who are not receiving standard health care because clinics and hospitals have been forced to close. West Africa is on the verge of a humanitarian crisis, and the world needs to respond compassionately and generously."" Rick Sacra had been to Liberia with SIM before, and volunteered to go again after he heard fellow missionaries Nancy Writebol and Dr. Kent Brantly had contracted the virus, Johnson said. Brantly and Writebol were flown to Atlanta last month for treatment at Emory University Hospital and have since been released. Human trial of experimental Ebola vaccine begins . Sacra started to show symptoms of hemorrhagic fever on August 29. Health care workers did an Ebola test on him Monday, which came back positive for the deadly virus. Sacra was following all protocols and taking necessary precautions against Ebola, Johnson said. It is unclear how he became infected, but SIM is working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to determine the point of contact. Doctors in Nebraska said they know they are in for a ""long haul"" with Sacra's treatment. They are hopeful but believe he could be under  treatment for at least two to three weeks. If he does recover fully, SIM leaders said that Sacra has said he intends to go back to Liberia to continue to help build and strengthen the country's medical infrastructure.","Dr. Rick Sacra has been flown to Nebraska for treatment .

"Washington (CNN)Cory Booker joined the Senate in 2013 as one of the chamber's most prolific Twitter users, boasting 1.4 million followers on his personal account. But when he got to Washington, the New Jersey Democrat had to start an official account from scratch, with zero followers. That's because congressional ethics rules bar Booker and other lawmakers from transferring their personal or campaign followers to their official government Twitter accounts. The prohibition is in place because lawmakers aren't allowed to use office tools for campaign purposes. Such rules reflect the growing challenge of coming to Washington in the digital age. Elected leaders must navigate an increasingly complex landscape to have the social media presence their constituents demand without getting in trouble. VIDEO: Who teaches the government how to tweet?To help make sense of it all, Twitter has invested in a Washington-based team to act as a liaison between the company and government entities that use the service. The group doesn't have any lobbyists or political agenda. Instead, this five-person contingent, which works with every level of government, from town mayors to the White House, serves the growing network of government entities for which Twitter has become a part of everyday life. On any given day, they walk the halls of Capitol Hill on their way to teach Senate communication directors how to use Twitter's latest tools, pass through security checks at federal agencies for a seminar with bureaucrats or host meetings at GOP or Democratic headquarters with campaign operatives. Adam Sharp, a political and media veteran who formerly worked for Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu and C-SPAN, leads the group from a small downtown office. ""Our role here is to help elected officials and agencies recognize that they can use the platform to communicate more effectively with constituents and give them ideas on how to do that,"" Sharp said. Sharp was Twitter's first Washington employee in 2010, when he initially set up shop from his living room. At that point, Twitter had already been around for four years, but only about a quarter of Congress used the platform. Sharp's job at the time was spent mostly persuading government agencies and lawmakers to join. Since then, Twitter has transformed the way Washington does business. In a town where information is traded like currency, Twitter's ability to share and spread a message has made it the first place many turn to break or find news. Nearly every government agency, from the Central Intelligence Agency to the U.S. Geological Survey, relies on the service, which they can use to reach their audience directly. As Twitter's popularity grew throughout government and political circles, the company's mission here adapted. Their task shifted from persuading elected leaders to take a risk and try their site to teaching eager policymakers how to use it better. Twitter's high-profile role has had an especially outsized role in reshaping the way Congress communicates with the media and constituents. In the weeks leading up to President Barack Obama's recent State of the Union address, Twitter's D.C. team was busy encouraging lawmakers to live-tweet their experience during the proceedings by posting their reactions, photos and videos using Vine, a camera app Twitter acquired in 2012. The pitch to members: Why wait for a television camera to find you when you can broadcast your personal response to the President of the United States in seconds? The campaign paid off. Within minutes of Obama's remarks, congressional staffers and even lawmakers themselves pulled out smartphones to shoot brief videos throughout Statuary Hall — the room outside the House chamber that doubled as a media spin room after Obama's address -- of their bosses rebutting or praising the President's proposals. The House Republican Conference even set up a rapid response station to help automate the process for lawmakers who needed some extra help. ""We're moving toward a situation where members are letting people into the process and viewing it through their own eyes, which is a lot closer,"" said Sean Evins, a former House Administration Committee staffer who joined Twitter's government team in 2012. ""You're seeing more members involved personally, and it brings a lot more people into the process."" Sharp's team last year produced a handbook for policymakers on how best to use the platform, which along with security guidelines, recommends that policymakers use their accounts themselves to share photos and information about their lives and work. (Twitter is aiming to compete on photo-sharing with Facebook-owned app Instagram, which is currently dominating the online photo market.) Of course, over-sharing can backfire. A website maintained by the watchdog Sunlight Foundation called ""Politwoops"" that tracks posts deleted by politicians serves as a graveyard of congressional digital mishaps. In January, freshman Republican Rep. Mike Bishop of Michigan tweeted photos from the House floor in violation of chamber rules that bar photography. He deleted them soon after. Last summer, several lawmakers removed tweets of praise for the release of hostage Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl once details of how the Obama administration handled the negotiations became known. Still, Twitter's D.C. reps hold that the opportunity to connect directly with constituents is well worth the risk. ""The best members of Congress who use Twitter are the ones who are using it themselves and using it in an authentic way,"" Sharp said. ""It's not something to be afraid of. Opening this new gateway for that direct one-on-one communication gateway with constituents is something we haven't had in a long time.""","Twitter's Washington staff promotes tweeting to governments around the world.
They don't lobby; they teach lawmakers and government agencies how to use Twitter's latest tools ."
"(CNN)For a group of radical anti-Western militants, ISIS is pretty good at luring Westerners to its ranks. The latest is an American teen from suburban Chicago who was allegedly on his way to join ISIS. Mohammed Hamzah Khan was stopped just before he was supposed to board a plane to Turkey, authorities said. But he's far from alone. Last month, U.S. authorities detailed their case against a New York food store owner accused of funding ISIS and plotting to gun down American troops who had served in Iraq. And a French man told his mother that he and his half-brother were going on vacation -- only to tell her later that they were fighting in Syria. ""Some of the foreign fighters may not return as terrorists to their respective countries, but all of them will have been exposed to an environment of sustained radicalization and violence with unknowable but worrying consequences,"" Richard Barrett of The Soufan Group wrote in a report called ""Foreign fighters in Syria"" this summer. So what is it about ISIS and its uncanny ability to recruit Westerners? Here are five methods the group employs: . It preys on a recruit's sense of identity . The recruits are often young -- sometimes disillusioned teenagers trying to find purpose and make their mark. For many, it boils down to a lack of a sense of identity or belonging, Barrett said. ""The general picture provided by foreign fighters of their lives in Syria suggests camaraderie, good morale and purposeful activity, all mixed in with a sense of understated heroism, designed to attract their friends as well as to boost their own self-esteem,"" he wrote. And some are drawn by the desire to die as a martyr who would enjoy a sumptuous afterlife if they die fighting the ""infidel"" enemy. It appeals to their religious duty . Westerners waging jihad, fighting alongside ISIS and other terror groups, is not a new phenomenon. The FBI and the U.S. Justice Department have been trying to stay ahead of wannabe terrorists since the 9/11 terror attacks. But what draws Americans to give up their comfortable lives in the United States and travel to war-torn countries to fight? An appeal to their sense of duty. It's a message frequently posted by ISIS on social media: ""You have to join. It's your religious duty,"" CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said. It operates a sophisticated propaganda machine . ISIS now operates the most sophisticate propaganda machine of any terrorist organization, said Matthew Olsen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center. ""Importantly, the group also views itself as the now-leader of a global jihadist movement,"" Olsen said. ""It turns out timely, high-quality media, and it uses social media to secure a widespread following."" ISIS has a penchant for producing slick videos that resemble trailers for Hollywood action movies. One hour-long video showed a collection of bombings, executions, kidnappings and beheadings. As one roadside bomb blasts a vehicle into the sky, two men in the background of the video chuckle. ""We are way behind. They are far superior and advanced than we are when it comes to new media technologies, social media, when it comes to video production qualities, and in disseminating their propaganda over the Internet,"" said Maajid Nawaz, a former jihadi and author of ""Radical: My Journey out of Islamist Extremism."" And it's probably no accident that a knife-wielding man in the beheading videos of Americans James Foley and Steven Sotloff and Britons David Haines and Alan Henning had a distinctive British accent. It drives home the point that Westerners can join ISIS, too. It exerts a cult-like control . When Steve Hassan heard an ISIS propaganda tape, ""it reminded me of the exhortations of Jim Jones' cult saying, 'Come to Jonestown. It's a paradise. It's wonderful.' And that keys in on one of the key principles of destructive cults, which is deceptive recruiting."" Hassan is the founder of Freedom of Mind, an organization dedicated to exposing destructive cults and cult behavior. ""This is a political cult using religion and a perversion of Islam as the shield. But in fact it's a systematic effort to create an army of basically tranced-out followers."" Video clips of foreign jihadists burning their passports show that many have no interest in returning home. It uses its successes as tool . About 2,000 Westerners have gone to fight in Syria, though it was not clear how many joined ISIS in its quest snatch more land and how many joined moderate opposition groups battling the Syrian government, a CIA source told CNN last month. But it's the extremist groups like ISIS that attract the most foreign fighters, Barrett wrote. ""They tend to be more inclusive, better organized and better financed than their more moderate counterparts,"" he said. ""They also tend to be more assertive and have more of an impact on the battlefield, and so enjoy greater local standing, which makes them still more attractive to foreign fighters looking to make their own impact."" UK authorities believe at least 500 British citizens have gone to Iraq and Syria, many of them to fight with ISIS and other Islamist groups. French authorities estimate more than 700 people have traveled from France to fight in Syria, according to Barrett. On Sunday, FBI Director James Comey told CBS' ""60 Minutes"" that his agency is tracking a dozen Americans that have joined terrorist groups in Syria. But it's not all alarming news. Concerned by the prospect of these recruits bringing home their angst and their ability to launch attacks, Western nations are fighting back. Some European countries have laws that penalize membership in groups such as ISIS, Barrett said. A U.S. State Department official said an anti-ISIS messaging campaign is keeping disaffected youth from joining. ""We have evidence that there are young people who are not joining because we have somehow interceded,"" Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs Richard Stengel said Monday. ""They're reading the messages, they're hearing the messages -- not just from us but from the hundreds of Islamic clerics who have said that this is a perversion of Islam, from the hundreds of Islamic scholars who have said the same thing."" But Barrett said elected officials might not be doing as much as they think. ""Policymakers often underestimate the impact of what is happening in these closed circles even as they overestimate the impact of their own."" CNN's Mariano Castillo, Catherine E. Shoichet, Laura Koran and Elise Labott contributed to this report.","ISIS has a penchant for producing slick videos that resemble trailers for Hollywood action movies .

"The European Court of Human Rights on Tuesday rejected a claim by a young Muslim woman that France's ban on the wearing of burqas and niqabs in public violates her rights. The French law banning the burqa, a full-body covering that includes a mesh over the face, and the niqab, a full-face veil with an opening for the eyes, went into effect in April 2011. It has pitted religious freedom advocates against those who say the Islamic veil is demeaning to women and inconsistent with France's rigorously enforced secularism. A 24-year-old French woman brought the case to Europe's top rights court in Strasbourg because she says the ban infringes on her ability to live according to her religious faith, culture and personal convictions. But the court said Tuesday that it found that the French law doesn't breach the European Convention on Human Rights. Muslim woman's case . The woman, a devout Muslim whose name has not been disclosed, had tried to draw on several articles of the convention to make her case. Those articles cover the right to respect for private and family life; the right to respect for freedom of thought, conscience and religion; and the prohibition of discrimination. The woman said no member of her family has put pressure on her to wear the burqa and niqab. She wears them in public and private, but not all the time, she said. The European Court of Human Rights started hearing the case in November. Debate in France . The French Constitutional Council said in 2010 that the law does not impose disproportionate punishments or prevent the free exercise of religion in a place of worship, finding therefore that ""the law conforms to the Constitution."" But critics argue the government has no business telling people what clothes to wear or how to practice their religion. The law drew criticism from some human rights and religious organizations and some Muslims as discriminatory. France has Western Europe's largest Muslim population. The French law imposes a fine of 150 euros (about $205) for wearing the items. The person breaking the law can be asked to carry out public service duty as part of the punishment or as an alternative to the fine. When the legislation came into effect, some analysts said it was largely born out of internal French politics, with former President Nicolas Sarkozy's center-right party seeking to fend off a challenge from a more hard-line right wing.","The court says the law doesn't violate the European Convention on Human Rights .

"In the past weeks, North Korean state media have called the female President of South Korea a ""dirty political harlot"" and an ""old prostitute"";  the gay chairman of the U.N. Commission of Inquiry on North Korea ""a disgusting old lecher with 40-odd-year-long career of homosexuality""; and, in a loathsome screed, referred to U.S. President Barack Obama as a ""monkeyish human monstrosity."" Still, North Korea's exceptionally vile words pale in comparison to its criminal actions. In North Korea, racism isn't just talk. That U.N. Commission of Inquiry's report summarizes testimony from North Korean refugee women and former border guards who say that the regime forcibly aborts or murders the babies of refugee women sent back to North Korea by China, on the presumption that the babies' fathers were Chinese, to maintain the myth of state-mandated ""racial purity."" It described a system of hereditary discrimination, based on perceived political loyalty, that denies lower-caste North Koreans opportunities for education, employment, and even food. The report asserts that Pyongyang fines women for wearing pants or riding bicycles, and forces thousands of them into sexual slavery by denying them an adequate supply of food. As for gay North Koreans, Pyongyang denies that they even exist, and said the report was spurred by lies and ""hostile forces."" North Korea's repellent language and actions teach us some uncomfortable lessons: . First, North Korea's remaining defenders on the far left do not deserve to be described as liberal or progressive. Although increasingly fewer in numbers, these ideologically committed apologists echo Pyongyang's justifications for its nuclear weapons programs, deny its responsibility for crimes against humanity, and -- despite Pyongyang's repeated violations of the 1953 Armistice -- insist that only a peace treaty can prevent war. To defend Kim Jong Un's rule, they must also defend its racism, its sexism, its homophobia, its class discrimination, and its extreme repression. Second, we should stop infantilizing North Korea and dismissing it as ridiculous. The temptation is understandable. The North Korean regime's very weirdness causes much of the world to dismiss its invective as the rant of a regime that is merely isolated, eccentric, and misunderstood. But North Korea is not just a bizarre abstraction --- an impoverished kingdom ruled by a young, overly well-nourished hereditary leader with an affinity for the National Basketball Association. It is a murderous regime that is approaching nuclear breakout, and whose human rights violations, according to the Commission of Inquiry, ""have no parallel anywhere in the world."" North Korea's words reflect the character of its political system. They manifest the malice of a regime that practices hate and inflicts it on its own people and its neighbors alike. It's time to treat Kim Jong Un like the threat to civilization that he is. Third, North Korea is not a problem the Obama administration can keep ignoring. North Korea has been caught assisting Syria's nuclear weapons and chemical weapons program; has sold ballistic missiles to Iran and Syria; and has sold arms to Hamas and Hezbollah. Yet, it has not been penalized for most of these actions. Indeed, North Korea may be the most influential regional actor in history in relation to its economic, political and cultural power, and the size of its territory and population. Over the past two decades, this poor, aid-dependent, isolationist state has outplayed the biggest and wealthiest nations in the world, including the United States, China, Japan, Russia, and South Korea, on high international politics -- nuclear diplomacy. Fourth, North Korea can't be appeased or patronized away. Since the mid-1990s, Pyongyang has reaped billions of dollars from the U.S. and its allies in return for empty pledges of de-nuclearization while forging ahead with its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Since 2008, North Korea has refused to show up at six-party de-nuclearization talks, in spite of U.S. and South Korean offers of aid. Despite years of aid and engagement, North Korea shows no interest in reform, has become more dangerous to South Korea as well as to its own people, and has become more hostile to the U.S. and the world. Today, North Korea is on the verge of a fourth nuclear test. North Korea must be held to the standards of the civilized world. For decades, diplomats and nongovernmental organizations alike have excused Pyongyang's transgressions, lies and crimes out of a desire to maintain relationships with it at all costs. The consequences of such appeasement are telling: Aid doesn't get to the hungry, disarmament deals collapse, U.N. sanctions leak, and a regime sustained by hate and contemptuous of human life and dignity acquires the bomb. Pyongyang uses its access to the civilized world to supply its increasingly wealthy elite with cash, while, according to the United Nations, 84% of North Korean households have poor or borderline food consumption. The world cannot sanction and subsidize the same regime at the same time. It must first pressure Pyongyang into understanding that change is its only choice, by taking the enforcement of U.N. Security Council sanctions seriously. For once, actions must have consequences. For Pyongyang to enjoy the benefits of civilization, it must live by the standards of civilization. Accepting Pyongyang's hate at face value is a first step toward credibly presenting Pyongyang with that dose of reality.","North Korean state media hurl foul insults against Obama, South Korea president, others .

"(CNN)An uncle of a Jordanian pilot captured by ISIS in Syria and threatened with beheading has appealed to the terrorist group to release its prisoner. ""It is in their benefit as well and the benefit of all us,"" Yassin AlRawashdeh, a former diplomat, told CNN on Friday. ISIS should set Moaz al-Kassasbeh free in order to gain more sympathy in the region, AlRawashdeh said. ""Otherwise, they will get the anger of the whole people of Jordan and the anger of the whole world,"" he said. ISIS had pushed Jordan to bring a convicted terrorist, Sajida al-Rishawi, to the Turkish border by Thursday evening. The Jordanians didn't, so governments and relatives were still waiting Friday to see whether ISIS followed through on its threat to kill al-Kassasbeh, followed by the beheading of a Japanese journalist, Kenji Goto. Another of the pilot's uncles,  Fahed Al-Kasasbeh, said the family hasn't received any information from official sources. And there has been no proof of life from ISIS. ""But we hope he is still alive,"" AlRawashdeh said. Al-Kassasbeh's father, Safi, made a similar appeal for his son's release Thursday, after the sunset deadline. Jordanian officials have said they are willing to swap al-Rishawi for the pilot. But Jordan's key condition is proof that al-Kassasbeh is still alive. ""At this point, we want to emphasize that we have asked for proof of life, and we have not received anything as of yet,"" government spokesman Mohammed al-Momani said Thursday afternoon, about an hour before the purported deadline. The lack of proof of the pilot's health is concerning, but Al-Kasasbeh said the family had received some information from ""unofficial sources"" that was comforting. Kidnappers are in a commodities exchange business, said Chris Voss, a former FBI hostage negotiator. And ""proof of life is part of this type of negotiation."" ""The Jordanians have no business going forward until they get it."" Al-Kassasbeh was captured after he ejected from his F-16 jet last month near Raqqa, the extremist group's de facto capital in Syria. Coalition warplanes and drones continue flying over ISIS strongholds in northern Syria, looking for any signs of unusual activity -- perhaps a convoy moving toward the border with Turkey. But hope is fading. ""Given the fact that ISIS has executed every hostage that they have publicly produced on a videotape except one British hostage, it does suggest that ISIS is not that interested in serious negotiations and is principally interested in the ability to get a lot of attention for its cause,"" said Peter Bergen, CNN's national security analyst. The 47-year-old Goto left Japan last fall, when his youngest daughter was 3 weeks old. His wife, Rinko, who heard from his captors first on December 2 and most recently in a Wednesday email with their ""final demand"" -- pleaded for his return. ""I hope our oldest daughter, who is just 2, will get to see her father again,"" his wife, Rinko, said. Thursday's deadline was the third that ISIS set in less than a week. The wait began with a video showing two Japanese hostages, Goto and aspiring security contractor Haruna Yukawa.  And an outrageous demand from ISIS: a $200 million ransom from Japan within 72 hours, or else both captives die. The first deadline passed a week ago Friday. Grim proof soon followed: An image of Goto holding what appeared to be a photo of Yukawa's headless body. Goto apparently was spared. ""What it shows is that they are reacting tactically,"" said CNN military analyst Ret. Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling. ""They no longer have a strategic plan. ... They are just trying to get the best thing going."" Days later, came a change in demands: ISIS now sought the release of al-Rishawi, a female jihadist imprisoned in Jordan for her role in a 2005 suicide bombing at a wedding reception that killed dozens. And if the swap wasn't made, the group threatened to kill both the pilot and the journalist. Wednesday night brought yet another deadline: deliver al-Rishawi to the Turkish border by sunset Thursday, or al-Kassasbeh and Goto would die. The relentless back-and-forth has raised hard questions about whether ISIS is truly negotiating, and whether Jordan made a mistake to try. ""They are attempting to elevate themselves into some sort of status as a political movement and a state,"" Hertling said. ""They are not. They are terrorists."" CNN's Kareem Khadder, Barbara Starr, Anderson Cooper and Jim Sciutto contributed to this report.","Uncle of captured pilot: If ISIS kills hostage it will face the anger of all of Jordan .

"(CNN)About a third of American parents harbor some degree of ""vaccine hesitancy"" that leads them to resist getting recommended vaccines.  It's also true that nearly a third of Americans think the evidence supporting climate change is shaky. Both these beliefs can be very dangerous.  And those of us who make and purvey science need to better understand why people distrust and reject scientific authority in this country if we're to combat it. The Disneyland measles outbreak has now spread to 14 states, and physicians have not been able to raise their voices high enough above the misinformed din to head off the suffering, disability and death that could result. There's not much we can do about the small core of people who oppose vaccines based on ideology: They have been with us since Edward Jenner first introduced his smallpox vaccine in 1798. But we have a better shot with the larger and more rational border zone of the vaccine hesitant who may base their concerns on genuine cases of vaccine harm, such as the very small but accepted link between influenza vaccination and a temporary paralysis called Guillain-Barré Syndrome. Part of the problem is that Americans see their government issuing mixed messages on the value of vaccination. Even in the midst of the current outbreak, and just as President Obama was imploring parents to vaccinate their children, New Jersey governor and likely presidential contender Chris Christie muddied the waters by unhelpfully asserting that parents should be given some leeway on whether  to vaccinate. I'll note here this is the same governor who famously erred in quarantining a returning Ebola aid worker who showed no signs of the disease, so hopefully we'll take his public health pronouncements in the proper context. Whether the issue is climate change, Ebola, or vaccine-preventable diseases like measles, each of these threats comes with a corps of true experts who must compete for the public's attention and trust with a set of vocal charlatans, conspiracy theorists and even politicians. In the case of measles, a breakdown of the patient-doctor relationship is to blame. The Internet has helped erode the old paternalistic relationship just as it has diminished all authority figures, while simultaneously welcoming fringe beliefs into the mainstream. Parents: What is your message to parents who don't vaccinate their kids? The Internet has brought down to earth the rarefied medical ""priesthood"" by democratizing access to its previously shrouded holy texts of medical science. At the same time, we doctors have injured our standing through decades of serving as willing cogs in a ballooning and inefficient medical industrial complex that took its customer base for granted. The teetering medical system has come crashing down in a conflagration of national debate about access, fair pricing and information sharing. We have witnessed the dawn of the ""empowered patient,"" whose self-generated and self-controlled data now offers the potential for enormous efficiency gains. Still, we know that cultivating a strong patient-doctor relationship is the most successful method of reversing vaccine opposition. But doctors can no longer dictate to their patients. It's not an option. The new role we doctors play, after all the dust is settled, is entirely built on trust. We are the expert consultant to whom you bring the information you have generated from your own body and your own research. We help you navigate your ideas and worries, and craft the concise guidance you need. At the same time we cannot ultimately be your concierge; we stand on the ground between our best understanding of science and its application. Navigating that shifting territory requires winning your trust. It's no coincidence that the golden age of vaccine acceptance in the mid-20th century corresponded with some of our most fundamental medical advances and peak prestige in the medical profession. I don't think we'll ever be there again. You've earned the right to question your doctor, and you may indeed bring information to the table that your doctor doesn't have. If we can carve out a system where your doctor is granted the time to truly understand you, while at the same time allowing your doctor to treat you appropriately in the border zone between our limited science and its limitless application, we'll build up the trust we need. If we've done our job right, you'll seek out the insights we've earned from treating many challenging cases over many years. And we'll know we've succeeded in our new relationship when you let us vaccinate your children.","Ford Vox: Some parents have been forgoing measles vaccines for kids.

"Kim Kardashian's 20-carat diamond engagement ring, a remnant of her 72-day marriage to NBA basketball player Kris Humphries, was auctioned Tuesday in New York by Christie's for $749,000, US Weekly reported. Christie's auction house confirmed the sale of a 20-carat ring to an anonymous buyer. It did not reveal whether it was the ring that Humphries gave Kardashian. The ring ""far exceed the presale estimate"" of $300,000 to $500,000, said Gabriel Ford, a spokesman for Christie's. ""This impressive diamond ring was sought out by two bidders in the back of the room, one online bidder and was ultimately won by a bidder on the phone,"" Ford said. Humphries, an NBA forward, accused Kardashian of fraud by entering the marriage only to make millions of dollars with their wedding, Humphries' lawyer, Marshall Waller, told a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge. The August 20, 2011, wedding was aired in October on E! Entertainment in a two-part special titled ""Kim's Fairytale Wedding: A Kardashian Event."" Kardashian filed for separation in October 2011, beginning a more than 20-month divorce battle. The couple's divorce was finalized in June just days before she gave birth to a girl fathered by rapper Kanye West.

"The names, which some liken to slurs, spread everywhere -- triggering anger in the United States as well as South Korea. Last week, KTVU, a TV station based in the San Francisco area, aired what it believed were the names of the Asiana Airlines Flight 214 pilots. A National Transportation Safety Board intern confirmed the bogus names -- phrases which sounded like ""Something Wrong"" and ""We Too Low."" And hello, perfect storm. Or as one blogger put it -- ""an epic mind-blowing fail."" The crash of the South Korean carrier had already hit racial notes -- with jokes mocking Asian driving or piloting skills and questions whether the crash had to do with the Korean culture. U.S. comedian Bill Maher quipped on his show, ""Now that we know the cause of that Asiana Airlines crash was the pilots flying too slowly, I don't want to hear another word about me doing Asian driver jokes."" His comment followed an array of similar jokes on social media. Phil Yu of the ""Angry Asian Man"" blog, said he was bracing himself for jokes after the crash. ""It's completely inappropriate especially because we're talking about a tragedy. People died, people were seriously injured,"" he said. The crash prompted speculation as to whether the Korean cultural deference to authority played a role in bringing the Boeing 777 down on the San Francisco runway on July 6. This is a hypothesis made about Korean airlines long before the Asiana crash. A blogger at Ask a Korean sarcastically asked: ""What is it about American culture that contributed a local station with heavily Asian population to blindly buy the obviously false representation from the NTSB? Is there an inherent deference to authority in American culture that contributed to this gaffe?"" The bogus names prompted the South Korean carrier to say it would take legal action against KTVU, because ""it was their report that resulted in damaging the company's image."" Several legal and PR experts questioned the wisdom of the lawsuit -- which the airline later said it would not pursue, while others on CNN's discussion board questioned whether the joke was even racist. ""Ah yes, the ""r"" word: racism. And the ""o"" word: offensive,"" wrote one commenter. ""Get over it. A mildly clever person pulled a reasonably funny (if insensitive - to the victims of the crash) prank."" ""I honestly believe nobody has a sense of humor anymore, and when someone does, they have to apologize for it. Get over it. It was hilarious!"" another wrote. Asiana won't sue TV station . Asian-American advocates say that creating vaguely Asian sounding names to crack jokes about a deadly plane accident that killed three Chinese girls is completely insensitive. ""Making up Asian names or mimicking foreign accents are not innocent forms of satire,"" wrote Paul Cheung and Bobby Calvan, of the Asian American Journalists Association. ""Doing so demeans and hurts."" Racial jokes around the fatal air crash ""are not benign,"" said Claire Jean Kim, an associate professor of political science and Asian American Studies at the University of California Irvine. ""Those kinds of jokes reflect a deeper view of Asian Americans as culturally different and inferior,"" she said. ""That's not a joke, that has material effects. It leads to a general sense, even those who are born here in the U.S., they simply don't belong."" Kim says denying that something is racist is a sign of the times. ""People are minimizing it as a joke,"" she said. ""In this particular period, many people claim that racism is a thing of the past, we live in a colorblind society, we should brush these things off."" The mocking of Asian names dates back to when immigrants arrived to the United States, said Gary Okihiro, founding director of the Center for Study of Ethnicity and Race at Columbia University. ""In the 19th century, many immigration officials who first greeted Asian migrants demeaned them, by first of all, making fun of their names because they couldn't pronounce them properly, or assigning them names like John Chinaman or China Mary,"" he said. ""Anything foreign seems to be open season or free game,"" Okihiro said. Passengers begin legal action against Boeing .","Some question why KTVU's fake pilot names were offensive .

"Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson, who shot and killed teenager Michael Brown on August 9, is in the final stages of negotiations with city officials to resign, according to people close to the talks. Wilson maintains he hasn't done anything wrong, and the resignation talks have hinged on whether a grand jury returns an indictment against him in the death of Brown, people close to the talks said. Wilson has told associates he would resign as a way to help ease pressure and protect his fellow officers.  Wilson has expressed concern about resigning while the grand jury was hearing evidence for fear it would appear he was admitting fault. Wilson could announce as soon as Friday his plans to resign, the same day a St. Louis County grand jury meets to deliberate and possibly decide on an indictment. The talks could still collapse, these people said. Wilson doesn't know what the grand jury will do and if they return charges he could change his mind.","Wilson shot and killed teenager Michael Brown on August 9 .
Sources: Wilson has told associates he would resign to protect his fellow officers .
Wilson doesn't know what grand jury will do and could change his mind, sources say ."
"Did Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson shoot Michael Brown dead as he staggered to the ground, hobbled by gunshot wounds? Or, did the 18-year-old aggressively charge at Wilson even after the officer ordered him to stop? A St. Louis County grand jury heard both versions and many more from dozens of witnesses who gave accounts of what happened on August 9, the day Wilson shot Brown to death in the middle of the street outside an apartment complex as dozens of people watched. The panel of nine white and three black members heard 70 hours of testimony from 60 witnesses and three medical examiners before declining to indict Wilson on Monday in Brown's death. Their decision touched off riots and looting in the streets of Ferguson and St. Louis, and protests nationwide. After the decision was announced, the St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney's Office released transcripts of the proceedings, offering a rare glimpse into the closed-door hearing. It may have been a gesture of transparency, but the conflicting witness accounts, redacted police statements and contradictory autopsies only seemed to leave a murkier picture of what happened. When the grand jury first convened on August 20, St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch told panelists that he hoped to wrap up proceedings by mid-October. Instead, the panel sat for 25 days over three months as multiple jurisdictions investigated Brown's death. In that time, a grass-roots social justice movement coalesced online, Brown's parents addressed the United Nations, and Wilson got married in secret. As weeks dragged on jurors appeared to understand that the public was getting impatient. In an exchange on September 20 before testimony got underway, two jurors raised concerns. ""My concern is that everybody is saying 'hurry up, hurry up, hurry up,' from what I'm hearing. Hurry up, make a decision, hurry up and get this done, hurry up and get that done,"" one juror said on September 30. ""I think everybody needs to ratchet it down a little bit and let us do what we can do. I have faith and trust in everybody in here, to make the decision that's appropriate. I'm not saying it is the right decision, I'm not saying it is the wrong decision, but make the decision that's appropriate based on the facts. But is that being disseminated by these groups or whatever to the people there?"" ""Do they not understand the process?"" another juror said. ""Is that the problem, or is there a way to bypass this because it seems to me that we're doing what needs to be done and we're doing what's right and people are not seeing that."" The transcripts provide a window into evidence the grand jury considered in making its decision. Some sticking points are beginning to emerge as CNN reviews the transcripts. What follows is a work in progress as we continue to read. When did Wilson start shooting? In Wilson's David-against-Goliath-like portrayal of the events, the six-year veteran of the force told the grand jury that he called for backup before he got out of his car. He feared for his life against the 6-foot-4, 290-pound Brown, likening the matchup to ""a 5-year-old holding onto Hulk Hogan."" Whether it was a tussle, a wrestling match, witnesses said they saw a confrontation between Brown and Wilson while Wilson was in his police SUV. Accounts varied regarding who was the aggressor, and not everyone heard gunshots that Wilson fired, by his own admission. But everyone saw Brown suddenly take off running east behind the car. What happened after Wilson stepped out of his car is unclear. Several witnesses testified that Wilson began shooting while Brown was running away from him. One witness claimed to watch from a bedroom window as Wilson shot at Brown as he ran in the opposite direction (volume 7, page 18). By the time the witness ran outside for a better look, Brown was ""bent down"" and facing Wilson with his arms tucked on his stomach, ""so I'm thinking now he's shot,"" the witness told the jury. Another witness supported that claim, saying in an audio recording played for the grand jury that Wilson immediately began shooting after emerging from his vehicle (volume 7, page 86). The witness also said that a bullet appeared to strike Brown, ""jerking his body."" A different witness testified that Wilson got out of the vehicle with his gun drawn but did not point it at Brown until Brown turned around to face him (volume 6, page 166). Did Brown raise his hands in surrender? What happened after Brown turned around is also hotly disputed. Were his hands up -- as in clearly raised up and out -- in surrender? Or were his palms up, meaning was he looking at his body with his arms near his sides, not necessarily in a conciliatory gesture? Or, did he put his hand in the waist of his pants, as if moving toward a gun, as Wilson testified? The same witness who said Wilson did not open fire on Brown as he ran away also said that Brown made absolutely no motion to surrender. ""He stopped. He did turn, he did some sort of body gesture,"" the witness testified. But ""it was not in a surrendering motion."" ""I could say for sure he never put his hands up after he did his body gesture, he ran towards the officer full charge. The officer fired several shots,"" the witness told the grand jury (volume 6, pages 166-167). In an earlier police statement, the witness admitted that his version differed from what others claimed to see, as bystanders traded stories on the street in the immediate aftermath. The same witness who claimed to see Brown's body jerk from a gunshot said Brown turned around and put his hands up. ""And, the officer walks up to and continues to just shoot, shoot him until he falls to the ground,"" the witness said. ""Even though his hands were up?"" a detective asks on the recording. ""Yes."" Did Brown charge at Wilson? Wilson testified Brown came at him after turning around to face him. ""As he is coming towards me, I tell, keep telling him to get on the ground, he doesn't. I shoot a series of shots,"" he told the grand jury. At least one witness agreed with Wilson, the one who said Brown ran toward the officer ""full charge."" Those who testified that Brown already had been wounded said the charge was more like a wounded stagger. ""He was going down definitely,"" said the witness watching from the balcony. ""And, the officer just let out a few more rounds to him and he hit the ground and that's when I seen blood."" (volume 7, page 21) As he was taking small steps ""like he was stumbling,"" the officer ""lets out some more shots and that's when he hit the ground,"" the witness testified. Another witness said Brown made it about 25 to 30 feet when he turned to face the officer, who had exited his vehicle by then, and Brown raised his hands, ""but he didn't raise them all the way up."" As Wilson yelled ""stop,"" Brown took two to three steps forward and ""pow, pow,"" the witness said in a police statement that was read aloud to the grand jury. Wilson staggered forward with the ""weirdest look on his face,"" the witness told police -- not a menacing look, but ""like he's coming to him like to plea with him stop."" Wilson continued yelling ""stop,"" but Brown stumbled forward ""real slowly,"" hunched forward and rocking back and forth as if he were in pain. Wilson fired again, the witness said. ""And as he was going, he kept firing. He kept firing. Until he hit the ground."" That last set of rounds was what set off everyone who was watching, the witness said. Brown was already down. Did Wilson have to keep shooting? ""He was, to me and I'm going to say it, he was executed,"" the witness said of Brown. ""Maybe he got caught up in the heat of the moment or whatever was his intention I cannot read that officer's mind, but he did not have to fire that last volley."" Was Wilson credible? This grand jury had something most grand juries don't get -- the man who fired the fatal bullets. Michael Brown, the best witness to cast doubt on his version of events, was dead. In the end, it came down to whether jurors believed Wilson's self-defense claim -- or if they could find a reason to disbelieve him. Wilson did say he was afraid another blow to the face would knock him out; he also feared Brown would take his gun and shoot him. In the end, the grand jury appeared to give more weight to Wilson's testimony.

"(CNN) -- What kind of politician is slashed in the face with a knife, and upon waking up in hospital the first thing they ask about is the election campaign? Answer: Park Geun-hye, South Korea's first female president, and a woman who has experienced her fair share of violence while working -- and growing up -- in government. Park was left with an 11 centimeter wound across her cheek after she was attacked by a man at a political rally in 2006. Her apparently businesslike response after waking from surgery -- ""How is Daejeon?"" -- referring to the party's campaign in that city, earned her the nickname ""Queen of Elections."" The moniker finally held true in December 2012, when Park was elected president of a country which hasn't had a female ruler in over 1000 years -- not since Queen Jinseong in the 9th century. This is a place with one of the highest levels of gender inequality in the world -- rated 111 worst out of 135 nations, by the World Economic Forum. Indeed, if you're a working woman, South Korea is the worst developed country on the planet to live in, according to the Economist's Glass-ceiling Index. All of which makes Park's position particularly remarkable. But then, perhaps it's no surprise the 62-year-old should pursue the country's top job, given her upbringing. Her father was military hardman Park Chung-hee, president of South Korea from 1961 to his death in 1979 -- when his own intelligence chief shot him over dinner. The murder came five years after his wife, and Park Geun-hye's mother, was also killed by an assassin who had been targeting her husband. And so at the age of 22, Park Geun-hye was forced to take on the role of first lady, accompanying her father to official events and even welcoming U.S. President Jimmy Carter and wife Rosalynn to the country in 1979. Almost two decades later, Park, who holds a degree electronic engineering, entered politics of her own accord, and is known for her straight-talking style. She is said to be an intensely private woman who has never married and mostly dines alone. The nation is her family, she likes to say. With North Korea on her doorstep -- a country which the U.N. recently denounced for human rights abuses ""comparable to Nazi-era atrocities"" -- there is now even greater international focus on Park's leadership. She spoke to CNN's Leading Women about her vision for the fourth-largest economy in Asia, and the personal tragedies which forced her into the public spotlight from an early age. ""I believe the very fact that I was elected as the first female president of the Republic of Korea is testament to the dynamism of Korean society. I feel an even greater sense of responsibility as president. I also feel that we can look forward to greater opportunities that enable women to fully tap into their potential and live out their dreams, given the dynamism of our society and the way the entire world is headed."" ""This is a time when we see fathers, especially young fathers, who would be more than willing to play their part in raising children and who are so willing to help their wives. We see many young fathers who would find great reward, pleasure, and joy in raising their children."" ""I can say my greatest mentor is the citizens of this country."" ""When I was a child I longed to become a teacher and after I got into college I had hoped to be able to contribute to the industrialization of my country by being involved in for instance in research in science and technology. And that is why I subsequently chose my major in electronic engineering in college."" ""With the sudden passing of my mother, heavy responsibilities and duties of the first lady were suddenly forced upon me. It was indeed an arduous task for me but I would say that my experience during those years continue to be very helpful to me even to this date."" ""After both of my parents passed away I lived a very normal life but then came the Asian economic crisis that buffeted South Korea in the late 1990s. I was shocked to see what was transpiring in the country and I couldn't just sit idly back knowing how much it took to build up this country and to see this country being engulfed in crisis and to see our people suffer so much. That's why I decided to take up politics."" Watch: South Korea's president talks economy . See: Park Geun-Hye on North Korea .

"(CNN) -- Evangelical pastor Ted Haggard described Thursday as ""fundamentally true"" an assertion that he engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a 20-year-old male volunteer in 2006. Pastor Ted Haggard acknowledged on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" that he had a second relationship with a man. The incident occurred when the two men were in bed together, Grant Haas said in a videotaped interview played on CNN's ""Larry King Live."" ""He pretty much asked me if it was OK if he masturbated in front of me or masturbated in the bed next to me,"" Haas said. ""I told him no, it would make me really uncomfortable. But he grabbed a bottle of lotion and started masturbating."" Haas added, ""(Haggard) used to say to me, 'You know what, Grant, you can become a man of God, and you can have a little bit of fun on the side."" Haggard, 52, said the incident was ""an indicator of the compulsive behavior"" that ruled him at the time. However, he said he has been undergoing therapy during the two years since and ""working it out.""  Watch Haggard accuser speak out » . Controversy involving Haggard first erupted in November 2006, when a former prostitute, Mike Jones, said the pastor had paid him for sex over three years and had used methamphetamine in his presence. Haggard initially admitted in interviews that he received a massage from Jones but denied having sex with him. He also said he bought methamphetamine, but threw it away instead of using it. The assertions received widespread news coverage and sparked charges of hypocrisy, particularly because Haggard had condemned homosexual sex.  Watch Haggard address allegations on Oprah » . Haggard is the former president of the National Association of Evangelicals, which claims to represent millions of people in 45,000 congregations nationwide. He was also the head pastor at New Life Church. In a settlement with New Life, the church and Haggard agreed that he would retain his six-figure salary for a year, leave the Colorado Springs area, receive counseling and not speak publicly about what had happened for one year, according to a church staff member with knowledge of the settlement but who was not authorized to speak on the record. In the CNN interview, Haggard credited Jones with having helped him by disclosing that information. ""I think he rescued me. I'm very grateful to him,"" Haggard said. He said he would have lost the support of his wife of 30 years, Gail, and their five children ""and been a drug addict"" had he not been caught. ""I paid a heavy price. It was stupid,"" he said. Haggard likened his struggles with his desires to the struggles faced by dieters who say, ""'I'm not going to eat today' and then they eat."" ""Many of the charges against me are exaggerated, but it doesn't matter,"" Haggard told Larry King. ""I'm guilty enough of so many things."" He acknowledged that his actions were hypocritical, but said he could not control his urges. ""I felt like God's plan was for sexuality to be in a monogamous, heterosexual marriage,"" he said. ""I wanted that. But at the same time, I had these other things going on."" Haggard said he had thought that focusing on his spiritual life would help, but found that it did not. ""It actually made me worse,"" he said. Haggard said that, for a time, he lost the ability to read the Scriptures and became suicidal. ""I think it was divine intervention that stopped me,"" he said. Asked if he has engaged in inappropriate conduct with any other men, Haggard did not give a direct answer, saying only, ""I have thoroughly discussed all of my sexual history with my wife and my therapist and, to some degree, the family, and we think that's an appropriate boundary for that."" Asked whether he considers himself bisexual or gay, Haggard said that different therapists have described him in different ways. ""The first said, 'You are a heterosexual with homosexual attachments.' I wasn't sure what that meant."" His current therapist, he said, described him as ""a heterosexual with complications."" Haggard said he has, at least, another year of therapy ahead of him. ""I think I'm still deeply wounded and scarred and somewhat confused,"" he said. About other men, he added, ""I have thoughts from time to time, but not compelling thoughts."" Nevertheless, he said, ""Today, I'm 100 percent satisfied with my relationship with my wife, and I have no compelling things in my life toward others."" He said he initially urged his wife to leave him, but she refused. ""I really do love this man,"" she told CNN when asked why she did not leave. But it was also her faith that led her to stick with the marriage, she said. ""The teaching of Jesus is that we forgive and that we love."" She said the two had ""a great sexual relationship in our marriage ... throughout marriage."" Though the news of his unfaithfulness came as a shock, it wasn't completely out of the blue, she said. ""I knew that Ted had some struggles in this area, particularly in his thoughts. I never knew that he acted on them."" Marcus Haggard, the couple's 25-year-old son, said he, too, was shocked by the revelations, but was more disturbed to learn that his father had lied. Still, he said the news brought the family closer together. ""He had lived so long on a pedestal,"" Marcus Haggard said about his famous father. ""He seemed practically perfect. There was a sense of relief in the fact that we could connect with our dad."" Asked if he wants to return to the pulpit, Haggard said, ""I think Gail and I both want to tell our story to the degree that it's helpful to other people. I don't know that that would mean a pulpit, but certainly I'd be interested in public speaking.""

"Two more infants have contracted the herpes virus after undergoing an ultra-Orthodox Jewish type of circumcision, which has been linked to the spread of the potentially deadly virus to newborn boys, according to the New York City Health Department. In the ritual, known as metzitzah b'peh, after removing the foreskin of the penis the person performing the procedure places his mouth briefly over the wound, sucking a small amount of blood out, which is  discarded. Antibacterial ointment is applied and the wound is bandaged. The health department says the procedure is dangerous because the contact with the mouth could transmit diseases such as herpes. Most adults are infected with the herpes simplex virus type 1, and while they may have no symptoms, the virus may be present in their saliva, according to the health department. (It is different from herpes simplex virus type 2, which is usually transmitted sexually.) ""While HSV-1 in adults can cause the common cold sore, HSV-1 infection in newborns is very serious,"" a department statement says. Since 2000, there have been 13 reports in New York City of infants contracting HSV-1, two of whom died from the virus. The health department reported that an estimated 20,493 infants in New York City were exposed to the practice in that period. In the most recent case, the infant developed a fever seven days after circumcision and vesicular lesions the following day, according to a press release from the city health department. Seventy percent of neonatal herpes cases show lesions and only 40% produce a fever. The DOH passed a regulation in September requiring all those who perform the ritual to get parental consent on a form stating that the procedure can lead to health risks. Several Jewish groups and three rabbis filed a lawsuit in federal District Court in Manhattan arguing that ""the government cannot compel the transmission of messages that the speaker does not want to express -- especially when the speaker is operating in an area of heightened First Amendment protection, such as a religious ritual."" Dr. Thomas A. Farley, commissioner of the city's health department, claimed the consent requirement was ""lawful, appropriate and necessary"" in a September press release. ""The city's highest obligation is to protect its children; therefore, it is important that parents know the risks associated with the practice,"" he said. Baby boys whose circumcisions likely involved the ritual between April 2006 and December 2011 had an estimated risk of contracting neonatal HSV-1 infection of 24.4 per 100,000 cases, 3.4 times greater than other infants, according to the health department. ""There is no safe way to perform oral suction on any open wound in a newborn,"" Farley said. While Jews regularly practice circumcision as part of their religion, metzitzah b'peh is limited to a relatively small number of ultra-Orthodox Jews.","Two infants diagnosed with herpes after ultra-Orthodox Jewish circumcision ritual .

"(CNN) -- A Republican senator pleaded guilty earlier this month to a misdemeanor disorderly conduct charge stemming from his arrest at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, according to state criminal records. Republican Sen. Larry Craig of Idaho was arrested in June at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. Roll Call newspaper reported Monday that Sen. Larry Craig of Idaho was apprehended June 11 by a plainclothes police officer investigating complaints of lewd behavior in an airport men's room. Roll Call reports on the U.S. legislature. Craig denied any inappropriate conduct in a prepared statement, and said he now regrets his guilty plea. ""At the time of this incident, I complained to the police that they were misconstruing my actions. I was not involved in any inappropriate conduct,"" he said. ""I should have had the advice of counsel in resolving this matter. In hindsight, I should not have pled guilty. I was trying to handle this matter myself quickly and expeditiously."" Congress is currently in recess, and Craig's office said he was on vacation in Idaho with his family, with no public appearances scheduled. Craig, 62, paid a $500 fine when he entered his guilty plea on August 8 in Hennepin County Municipal Court in Bloomington, Minnesota, according to state criminal records. CNN confirmed that Craig was sentenced to 10 days in jail but that sentence was stayed. Minnesota law defines disorderly conduct as brawling, disturbing a meeting or engaging in ""offensive, obscene, abusive, boisterous or noisy conduct."" According to Roll Call, the arresting officer alleged that Craig lingered outside a rest room stall where the officer was sitting, then entered the stall next door and blocked the door with his luggage. According to the arrest report cited by Roll Call, Craig tapped his right foot, which the officer said he recognized ""as a signal used by persons wishing to engage in lewd conduct."" The report alleges Craig then touched the officer's foot with his foot and the senator ""proceeded to swipe his hand under the stall divider several times,"" according to Roll Call. At that point, the officer said he put his police identification down by the floor so Craig could see it and informed the senator that he was under arrest, before any sexual contact took place. Idaho's senior senator is married with three grown children and nine grandchildren. A former rancher, Craig was first elected to the Senate in 1990, after serving a decade in the House. His seat is up for re-election in 2008. Last fall, Craig's office publicly denied assertions by Internet blogger Mike Rogers that the senator is gay. Craig's office dismissed speculation about the senator's sexuality as ""completely ridiculous."" In 1982, Craig denied rumors that he was under investigation as part of a federal probe into allegations that lawmakers on Capitol Hill had sexual relationships with congressional pages, saying the ""false allegations"" made him ""mad as hell."" He was never implicated in that investigation, which eventually led to ethics charges against two other congressmen. In recent years, Craig's voting record has earned him top ratings from social conservative groups such as the American Family Association, Concerned Women for America and the Family Research Council. He has supported a federal constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, telling his colleagues that it was ""important for us to stand up now and protect traditional marriage, which is under attack by a few unelected judges and litigious activists."" In 1996, Craig also voted in favor of the Defense of Marriage Act, which denies federal recognition to same-sex marriages and prevents states from being forced to recognize the marriages of gay and lesbian couples legally performed in other states. Craig has also opposed expanding the federal hate crimes law to cover offenses motivated by anti-gay bias and, in 1996, voted against a bill that would have outlawed employment discrimination based on sexual orientation, which failed by a single vote in the Senate. Craig has endorsed former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney in the 2008  presidential race. The senator was named in February, along with Sen. Robert Bennett of Utah, as Romney's liaison to build support among GOP senators. Monday night, Romney's presidential campaign announced Craig was stepping down. ""He didn't want to be a distraction, and we accept his decision,"" the Romney campaign said in a statement. Access to a YouTube video in which Craig praised Romney was also blocked.

"(CNN)In late January, Kristiana Coignard, a seventeen-year-old woman with bipolar disorder and depression, walked into the police department in Longwood, Texas, with ""I have a gun"" written on her hand. She also had a knife in her waistband. Officer Glenn Derr approached her, read her message, and quickly restrained her. He then let her go, restrained her on the floor, then let her go again as two other officers entered the scene. On the surveillance video that the department released, you can see the moment in which Coignard decides to die. She raises her knife and charged at Derr, who shoots, as does one of the other officers. The third officer deploys a TASER, but by then it was too late. She lies on the floor for a few minutes until emergency medical services arrive. The department has released a statement and held a press conference. The officers have been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of an investigation by the Texas Rangers. When police misread the circumstances of encounter with an individual with mental health crisis, the possibility for violence rapidly escalates. The only solution is for law enforcement to try to stabilize every encounter, to the extent possible, as if it involved psychiatric disability. As a nation, we are in the midst of an extended conversation about police violence, and this case stands out as unusual. The victim was white and female, for one thing. Moreover, ugly use-of-force incidents usually result from police being too quick to escalate, rather than too slow. In the last few years I've watched many videos, either from cell phones or police cameras, and read even more incident reports describing encounters between law enforcement and people with psychiatric disabilities. I cannot recall seeing a case in which an officer has a potentially violent individual so well subdued, and then just backs away. I wondered if just as being black and male sparks some officers to be overly aggressive, a confrontation with a slender white female might produce the opposite effect. The best known victims of police violence while in mental health crisis are black men.  Police arguably are more prone to consider black men dangerous. They demand instant compliance and respond to any hesitation as a threat. For example, in cases such as the death of Kajieme Powell in St. Louis, or Dontre Hamilton in Milwaukee, police officers engaged aggressively, demanding the individual act in a non-disabled manner and comply. In my review of such encounters, I've argued that Powell, Hamilton, and many other individuals in similar circumstances, couldn't follow orders as expected. Therefore, they were shot and killed. These are cases of law enforcement officers failing to recognize the complexity of a mental health situation. In Longview, Texas, on the other hand, the incident shows the other side of the coin -- under aggression. I spoke to Lou Hayes, a police officer and a trainer for use-of-force incidents, he said that in his experience many officers are likely to be less aggressive toward women, especially small women, in ways that put everyone in greater danger. ""Generally speaking, male officers are more reluctant to use lawful, justified, and necessary levels of force against women as compared to incidents with men."" He also said that use-of-force models for a suspect armed with a knife, but restrained, might differ. Hypothetically, Hayes says that if he could control a suspect's arms, he would not let her free from the restraint hold, but that if he feared he might lose control, backing up and readying his firearm might be a reasonable choice. At this time Officer Derr is not speaking about his decision-making, due to the ongoing investigation, so I don't know why he didn't try to handcuff her. I expect the investigation to determine that he was operating within the norms of his training for use-of-force. There's no question that using a firearm and aiming for center mass is the correct response for someone at close proximity charging you with a butcher knife raised. It's just not the only way to handle these situations. For example, in Milwaukee recently, a man with a butcher knife charged at police officers. They held their fire, remembering the death of Dontre Hamilton, and instead led him in a chase around parked cars, shouting at him to drop his knife, and simply waited until he eventually complied. That's a model of tactical restraint that we need to see applied more broadly. Encounters between people with psychiatric disabilities and law enforcement can be dangerous. Studies estimate that around half the people killed by law enforcement every year have psychiatric disabilities such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.  There will always be some situations in which the threat level is so great that there's no way to stabilize it peacefully. But the death of Kristiana Coignard was not one of them.  Her death demonstrates that the ongoing crisis of violent police encounters with people with mental health transcends race, class and gender. It requires fundamental rethinking of strategic approaches to these types of incidents on a national level.  Until that happens, the unnecessary deaths will continue.","Kristiana Coignard, who had mental illness, was killed after she raised knife and charged at police .

"Washington (CNN)The Secretary of Veterans Affairs announced Monday a massive restructuring of the department in the wake of a scandal that left more than a hundred thousand veterans waiting for health care. VA Secretary Robert McDonald, who took over the agency three months ago after his predecessor Eric Shinseki resigned, said at least 35 people will be initially fired -- and more than 1,000 could soon follow. ""We're simplistically talking about people who violated our values,"" McDonald said in an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes"" that aired Sunday. ""It's integrity, it's advocacy, it's respect, it's excellence. These are the things that we try to do for our veterans."" But McDonald first needs to build up a case against each person listed on the pink slip list, since a judge needs to approve each firing. ""We've got to make it stick,"" he said in the interview. Beyond sacking officials that don't meet the VA's new standards, McDonald's reforms are also expected to restructure health care services for veterans, consolidating management of the massive health care system and giving veterans a single point of contact to get care, the New York Times reported Saturday. McDonald's reforms will also attack the core cause of the VA's sometimes 90-day-plus wait times that left some veterans dying as they waited for a doctor's appointments. Details of the delays were first reported by CNN in November. McDonald told ""60 Minutes"" he hopes to hire about 28,000 medical professionals to join the agency's hospitals and clinics around the country, including about 2,500 mental health professionals. And the new VA secretary is taking the initiative to reach that goal, visiting hospitals and medical schools to recruit young doctors to join the ranks of a health care network on the rise -- and pitching incentives like student loan forgiveness. McDonald's Monday announcement comes one day before Veterans Day.","Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert McDonald took over the agency earlier this year .

"Justice Department and FBI representatives have had a front-row seat to the St. Louis County investigation into the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. They've participated on witness interviews and got full access to grand jury testimony and evidence. But in the coming weeks, when local authorities announce the results of the investigation and a decision by the grand jury on possible charges against the police officer who killed him, don't expect federal authorities to be standing next to county prosecutor Robert McCulloch. McCulloch has pushed for the federal officials to coordinate the completion of the separate federal civil rights investigation and to make a joint announcement, according to federal and local officials briefed on the discussions. Local officials believe a united front would help reduce the potential for violence on the streets if the grand jury declines to bring charges against officer Darren Wilson. Justice officials have rejected the idea, in part because they believe a joint announcement would undermine their argument that the federal investigation is independent. 5 crucial things about the grand jury investigation . State and federal investigations are focused on separate legal statutes, federal officials say. A Justice official says that the department ""has informed the locals that the [federal] investigation will conclude when it's ready not on an artificial timetable."" If, as is widely expected, the St Louis County grand jury declines to bring charges, the Justice Department could announce it will review the state investigation to ensure it was done properly, according to the officials briefed on the matter. Rising tensions between officials . Local officials bristle that the federal government could do another review. That's because the Justice Department and the FBI have sat through almost every interview, or have had access to transcripts from those interviews, according to government officials. The tussle has heightened an already tense situation in discussions among local, state and federal officials. All are concerned about possible violence in the wake of the grand jury's decision. No one wants the blame. The manner in which the local prosecutor has presented the case is somewhat unusual for St. Louis County. Ferguson on edge as doubts raised over Darren Wilson indictment . Usually grand jury proceedings involve a couple of witnesses, but, in this case, there have been many more. And the prosecutor is presenting all evidence to the grand jury, including information that supports the account of Wilson. That's also unusual. There is some cooperation between the federal and local investigators. The FBI performed some of the forensic tests that the state is using in its case. Trying to heal a community-police rift . But as the investigation into the shooting has continued, federal and state officials, along with members of the Missouri congressional delegation, have been working on proposals to try speed reforms to improve a poor relationship between the Ferguson police and the mostly African-American community it is supposed to protect. Among the those efforts is a plan in the works under which Thomas Jackson would step down as Ferguson police chief to make way for the St. Louis County Police Department to assume management of the smaller force, according to government officials briefed on the discussions. CNN's report on those plans prompted pushback from city officials who already weren't pleased by state and federal officials push for rapid changes. On Wednesday, Attorney General Eric Holder said in remarks at the Washington Ideas Forum: ""I think it's pretty clear that the need for wholesale change in that department is appropriate."" Last month, the Justice Department publicly released a letter it sent to the Ferguson Police to prohibit city officers from wearing on-the-job wristbands with the words ""I am Darren Wilson."" Justice Department officials have also expressed anger at leaks that they blame on local authorities trying to manage the public perception of the case. Another point of contention could come at the end of the grand jury process, when local officials want to immediately release all evidence that was part of their investigation. If federal officials are still conducting their investigation, they may oppose the release of sensitive information.

"Selma, Alabama  (CNN)On a recent morning, Edward Shaw and other family members walked into the Selma Police Department in search of answers. They had come to see official video footage of a police shooting that took place more than a year ago. Ananias Shaw, 74, was killed last December after he rushed an officer while wielding a hatchet, police have said. Video of the incident, captured by an officer's lapel camera, proved the shooting was justified, officials have argued. A grand jury heard the case, saw the footage and decided not to issue an indictment. But for more than a year, Shaw's younger brother, Edward, 69, said he and others have been asking to see the tape for themselves. And what they saw on December 19 only seemed to raise more questions, leaving them to feel the shooting was more senseless than ever. With police shootings making headlines across the nation, the Selma case adds a different layer to the conversation -- not least of all because of the city's historic civil rights significance. CNN saw the video, which runs four minutes and 48 seconds, after the family did. It shows a patrol officer pulling up to an abandoned building, where two other officers have already gathered. One officer ducks inside the building and soon Ananias Shaw emerges, holding an ax and cussing. An officer follows, there are at least 20 shouts to ""drop the ax,"" and then Shaw turns toward the officer, appears to lunge toward him, and -- bang -- he's dead. Officers had been called to respond to a disturbance at a Church's Chicken restaurant, but found Shaw across the street in the long-gone Towns Laundromat. Edward Shaw said his brother, once a mechanic, had ""lost himself"" after his wife left him decades ago and his house burned in a fire. He said Selma police knew his brother ""acted crazy,"" and walked the streets but that he never harmed anyone. And he just can't understand why they had to follow him. ""He'd left Church's Chicken, and wasn't shot for disturbing the peace, but because they were messing with him in his domain."" Shaw said requests to see the video only gained traction after a small band of protesters took to the streets. It was the Ferguson, Missouri, protests that inspired longtime activist Faya Rose Toure to lead the charge for the Shaw family in Selma, though the circumstances are vastly different from Ferguson. Selma, which is more than 80% African-American, has a black mayor, a black police chief, a black district attorney and a majority black city council. Ananias Shaw was black. So was the officer who shot him. But for Toure, the problem in Selma goes far beyond this one case. Selma once shocked the national consciousness when police beat and tear-gassed 600 civil rights marchers as they crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge on their way to Montgomery. The day became known as Bloody Sunday and led the way to the Voting Rights Act of 1965. A movie depiction of the Selma story will release nationwide on January 9. Selma, said Toure, has come a long way since then, but black people are not yet free of injustices. She has led the charge in recent weeks, marching from Selma's famed Edmund Pettus Bridge while yelling, ""Hands up! Don't shoot!"" and ""I can't breathe!"" -- in reference to the deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson and Eric Garner in New York. Added to the mix in Selma has been this chorus: ""Show the tape!"" Police Chief William Riley said he takes no issue with protests tied to the tensions roiling through the country. What happened in Ferguson and New York bothers him, too. ""We have things going on in policing that aren't right,"" he said. If people want to scream outside his department, ""I can't breathe,"" he's all for it. But what riles him is how what happened in Selma is being lumped with these cases. ""It's wrong and disingenuous,"" he said. ""We're no Ferguson,"" and pretending Selma is, he said, ""hurts the message."" Activist Toure said it was her husband, Alabama State Sen. Hank Sanders, who was responsible for $30,000 in funding for the city of Selma to buy lapel cameras for the police force. She has called for a public release of the video showing the shooting of Ananias Shaw, calling it a ""matter of transparency."" ""They let CNN see [the tape] before me. I need to see the tape, as an attorney and a citizen,"" Toure said. ""If there's any doubt that the killing was justified, we would demand that the D.A. reconvene the grand jury."" Riley, the police chief, said the family should see it first. He said it wouldn't be easy to watch and that they deserved space to process it on their own. ""I don't care who's jumping up and down,"" Riley said. ""We want the family to see it first. It's only fair."" Ananias Shaw's children, who live in the Chicago area, were able to see the video several hours after family members in Selma did. They, too, walked away troubled and wanting more answers. Randall Shaw called it ""inconclusive,"" and his brother, Marvin Shaw, complained about editing. He said the video was choppy and skipped from one place to another. ""We need more information to move forward, to have closure,"" Marvin Shaw said. Civil rights attorney Russell Ainsworth, who said he has been working with the family to obtain the videotape since June, said he will be contacting the Selma police chief to demand the release of the lapel camera videos from the other two officers who were present. He also said the family wants to know the name of the officer who shot Shaw. ""What we did learn from the video is that officer appeared to be poorly trained,"" Ainsworth said. ""He put himself so close to Mr. Shaw that he escalated the situation."" The police chief said the officer is no longer on the force, but he didn't say why he left or where he'd gone. Lt. Johnny King, who has been with the department for nearly 28 years, said he knew of only two police shooting fatalities in all that time. With the police chief on vacation and out of town on the day of the viewing, it was King who showed the video to the family in Selma. He also showed it to CNN. When asked questions, he could only say, ""No comment."" Activist Toure raised other questions, too. She said that while there may have been witnesses who said they saw Ananias Shaw rushing the officer, there was also a witness who said she saw no such thing. Resident Betty Ford said she and her daughter were on their front porch when she saw police following Shaw through her yard. She pointed to the place in front of her home where she said the officer shot the man dead. Ford said she didn't see him raise the hatchet. She said he wasn't threatening anyone. But Ford was never called to testify before the grand jury, Toure said. Why is that? District Attorney Michael Jackson had an answer. He said Ford was not called because her words would not have changed the video. ""What's the point?"" he said . ""You can bring in 50 witnesses and it would not change what the tape clearly shows."" Though the police force has since acquired Tasers, officers didn't have them at the time. ""The officer only had one choice,"" Jackson said. But Edward Shaw said there was no reason for the police to give his brother chase. ""They flushed him out like a rabbit"" and treated his brother like ""a nobody,"" he said. ""Life beat him down, but he was a good man.""","Family of Ananias Shaw questions circumstances of his death .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Thursday's coordinated attack on Israeli soldiers and civilians, the deadliest in more than two years, spawned reprisal, rhetoric and questions over security in neighboring Egypt. Israel's military said it launched an airstrike against militants in Gaza on Thursday, hours after a string of bold attacks on buses, civilian vehicles and soldiers left seven Israelis dead in the southern part of the country. Palestinian medical officials said an airstrike north of Gaza City killed a boy in a home and injured five early Friday. Three other people were injured, they said, in a strike on a Hamas government compound south of the city. Israeli police said an eighth Israeli, a special operations officer, was killed late Thursday in fighting with Sinai border infiltrators. ""We all witnessed today an attempt to escalate the terrorist war against Israel by launching of attacks from the Sinai,"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. ""If there is someone who thinks that the state of Israel will let this pass, he is mistaken."" The Popular Resistance Committees in Gaza, whose leaders were targeted in the airstrike, and Hamas denied involvement in the terror attacks on Israel, with the latter claiming Israel was looking for a pretext to attack Gaza. The first retaliatory Israeli airstrike occurred just west of Rafah, close to the Egyptian border, and killed six people, Palestinian medical and security sources said. The victims were five Popular Resistance Committees members and the son of one of the members. Kamal Nirab, head of the group in Gaza; Imad Hamed, head of its military wing; and Khaled Shaat, a senior operative, were among those targeted, the IDF said. ""IDF's blows are now hitting the heads of the committees in Gaza,"" Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said. ""The people who gave the order to murder our citizens and that were hiding in Gaza are no longer alive,"" Netanyahu said. Late Thursday, the IDF said forces intercepted a rocket fired on Israel from Gaza. Hours earlier, six civilians and one Israeli soldier were killed and 40 people were wounded in attacks about 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the Israeli city of Eilat, close to the Israeli-Egyptian border. Israeli soldiers exchanged gunfire with the assailants and killed seven militants, the military said. Popular Resistance Committees militants attacked with the intention of kidnapping an Israeli civilian or soldier, the IDF said. Israel believes that the attacks had their roots in Gaza but were coming out of the neighboring Egyptian region of Sinai. They come amid what Barak says is ""the weakening of Egyptian control over Sinai."" Egypt claims it has been cracking down on terror groups in its portion of the Sinai, exchanging fire with militants on its side of the border. Khaled Fouda, the governor of Southern Sinai, an Egyptian province, said ""the security at border has not been affected by the revolution, and no one from Egypt has crossed through to conduct the attacks on Israel."" ""The distance between the place of the attack and the border of Egypt is too far to allow the sort of attack conducted on the Israelis today with the weapons used,"" Fouda added. Senior Egyptian military and security officials told CNN that two members of the Central Security Forces (CSF) and one military officer were killed in clashes near the southern border between Israel and Egypt. Gen. Saleh Al Masry, head of security in North Sinai Province, said an Israeli helicopter was in action over the area, chasing militants in the aftermath of the attacks on Israelis. ""The Israeli ground troops engaged with armed militants 200 meters from the Egyptian border which may have also led to casualties on the Egyptian side,"" said Egyptian army spokesman Lt. Col. Amr Imam. ""We have reinforced our border guards and raised the level of alert."" The incident allegedly occurred east of Ras Al-Naqab, about 13 kilometers north of Taba. An Israeli army spokesperson told CNN in Jerusalem the IDF had no information on the Egyptian claims. Hamas denied responsibility for the earlier strikes against Israelis and condemned ""the crime in Rafah."" Ihab Al Ghosen, a Hamas spokesman, said the Interior Ministry ""announced a state of emergency and told the people to be careful and take all the measures needed, hospitals are on high alert, and concentrations of security forces were evacuated."" Abu Suhayb, the spokesman for the Popular Resistance Committees, said the group would have announced its involvement if it were responsible. ""We warned Israel not to blame us just because it is easy for them to do so,"" he said. ""All the options are open now for reaction, from kidnapping soldiers, to suicide attacks inside Israel and to shelling with rockets."" Israel had been on heightened alert in the south of the country, and an elite counter-terrorism unit was in the area, according to an Israeli government source who doesn't want to be identified because he cannot speak publicly about the matter. The counter-terrorism unit and Israeli soldiers responded to the attacks, the source said. The incident began when shots were fired at a civilian bus traveling from Beer Sheva to Eilat, near the community of Netafim. Attackers also fired shots at another bus and two civilian vehicles. Eilat is a resort town on Israel's southern tip, near Egypt's Sinai border. Officials say it's likely there were both civilians and active-duty soldiers traveling by bus in the area because it was the start of the weekend and soldiers might have been going on breaks to the Eilat area. Later, IDF soldiers were injured when an explosive device was detonated as they arrived on the scene. Several mortar shells ""were simultaneously fired from the Gaza Strip at soldiers conducting routine maintenance work on the security fence on the Israel-Egypt border."" That was a bit farther north along the border from the bus attack, the IDF said. ""This is a malicious attack on innocent civilians, who were on their way to the known tourist destination city, Eilat, for their summer vacation,"" the IDF said. ""The IDF will pursue those responsible for this attack at all costs and will not allow any further harm to Israeli civilians."" Barak said Israel ""will not always be able to prevent such attacks."" ""The Egyptian control over Sinai is weakening, and this is probably the reason that this attack that originated in Gaza has made it all the way down here."" ""In light of what's happening near Eilat, our deepest condolences go out to the victims, their families and loved ones, of what appears to be a brutal and cowardly act of terrorism in southern Israel,"" the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv said. Eilat generally has not endured the kind of strife faced by other regions including the swath of southern Israel near Gaza, the coastal Palestinian territory just south of the Jewish state along its west coast. Across the border, the Egyptian army and police are cracking down in an ""anti-terror"" operation in the Sinai area of Egypt, state-owned media reported Tuesday, as reports emerged of Osama bin Laden's doctor surfacing in the area. Police said they found hand grenades, machine guns, rocket-propelled grenades and ammunition in the operation that targets Sinai ""terror cells"" suspected in attacks on a gas pipeline to Israel and a police station in the border town of el-Arish. Since the overthrow of the Mubarak regime, the security situation in Sinai has dramatically deteriorated. Senior Egyptian officials said several weeks ago that more than 23,000 prisoners escaped from prisons in Egypt in late January and February because of the breakdown in regime authority. About one-third of the escapees have been recaptured, but many apparently traveled to the Sinai to take advantage of the relative absence of state security. Many of the weapons looted from police stations ransacked during the revolution ended up in the Sinai. Travel between Egypt and Gaza has become much easier since the Military Council reopened the border crossing at Rafah in late May. But along with traders -- and Gazans just wanting a break from their cramped sliver of territory -- there are signs that Islamist groups have begun taking advantage of weaker security. The crossing is the only land passage out of Gaza not directly under Israeli control. Questions are being raised about the Egyptian military presence in the demilitarized zone in Sinai, which was created under the terms of the Camp David Agreement signed in 1978 between Egypt and Israel. CNN's Kevin Flower, Michal Zippori, Talal Abu Rahma, Guy Azriel and Ben Wedeman and journalist Mohamad Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report.","Egypt says three troops killed in clashes near border .

"(CNN)The stage is set for high tensions between two of the macho men of world politics at a leader's summit next month, after Australian PM Tony Abbott vowed to ""shirt-front"" Vladimir Putin over the MH17 disaster. ""Shirt-fronting"" is a term used in Australian rules football, referring to an aggressive, front-on physical challenge. Abbott used the term Monday when speaking to reporters about the Russian President's attendance at the G20 Leaders' Summit, to be held in Brisbane next month. Abbott told reporters: ""Look, I'm going to shirt-front Mr. Putin... you bet I am. I am going to be saying to Mr. Putin, Australians were murdered. They were murdered by Russian-backed rebels using Russian-supplied equipment."" He continued: ""We are very unhappy about this. We accept that you didn't want this to happen but we now demand that you fully cooperate with the criminal investigation, and if the criminal investigation identifies suspects that you have some influence over, they've got to be produced and justice has got to be done."" Putin's upcoming presence on Australian soil has been a contentious topic in the wake of the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in July over an area of eastern Ukraine controlled by pro-Russia separatists. Thirty-eight Australian citizens and residents were among the 298 killed in the tragedy. The United States, Ukraine and others have blamed on the separatists. Russia has denied involvement. Abbott told reporters his conversation with Putin would be ""the toughest conversation of all."" Russia: 'Offensive, insulting' The Kremlin has issued no official response to the remarks, but Alexander Odoevskiy, second secretary and spokesman at the Russian Embassy in Canberra, told CNN the comments were ""immature,"" ""offensive"" and ""insulting."" ""Some say it's tough talk. We say it's immature talk,"" he said. ""Definitely, it's personal and insulting. It's not the usual way one leader can communicate with another leader."" Odoevskiy said the obscure Australian sporting reference suggested the comments were directed to a domestic audience. ""What we have ... is a high-profile, media-oriented, politicized statement that is of no value to achieve the outcomes of the ongoing (MH17) investigation,"" he said. ""From the Russian perspective, we think the West has lost interest in learning the truth about MH17."" Abbott has faced calls to bar Putin from the G20 Leaders' Summit. But on Sunday, Australian Treasurer Joe Hockey confirmed to public broadcaster ABC that Putin would attend, saying G20 member nations were in consensus that he should be there. Opposition leader Bill Shorten told reporters Monday: ""When you deal with an international bully, the way you do it isn't by laying out the red carpet, so no, I don't think he's welcome. I don't think most Australians want him here."" Odoevskiy said that although Putin currently is preparing for the summit, there were no requests from either side at present for a bilateral meeting between the two countries. Abbott's comments were picked up by Russian media, as well, with Pravda, the newspaper associated with the Russian Communist Party, returning fire in an editorial decrying Australia's ""insolence"" and ""colonial chip on its shoulder."" It slammed Abbott as ""rude, insolent, insulting, impolite, impertinent, unpolished, gross, unpleasant and downright impudent.""","Australian PM vows to ""shirt-front"" Vladimir Putin over MH17 at G20 summit in Brisbane .

"(CNN)It started like any other of Peter Greste's 400 days in captivity. The Australian journalist, held in an Egyptian prison since December 2013, was exercising when the prison warden beckoned him over and told him that he needed to get ready to leave. ""Pack your stuff,"" he was told. Confused, he asked the warden what he meant -- was he being transferred to another prison? ""He said: 'You're going... the embassy's coming, they'll be here in an hour, so get your stuff and go,'"" Greste told his network, Al Jazeera, in an interview with correspondent Stefanie Dekker in Cyprus. ""I can't tell you that real mix of emotions that was boiling inside,"" said Greste. ""It's a relief and excitement but also real, real stress at having to say goodbye to my colleagues and friends, the people who have really become family inside that prison."" READ MORE: Freed Al Jazeera journalist is 'safe, healthy and very happy,' family says . Having experienced ""an awful lot of false starts with this, and an awful lot of false alarms,"" Greste hadn't wanted to set his faith in the Egyptian system until he was safely out of the country. But once he had his ""backside into a seat on the plane,"" the relief was palpable. However, his joy was tempered by the fact he was leaving behind fellow Al Jazeera journalists, Mohamed Fadel Fahmy and Baher Mohamed. All three were convicted of supporting the banned Muslim Brotherhood, but have maintained their innocence. In addition, another seven were convicted in absentia alongside the journalists. ""I feel incredible angst about my colleagues, leaving them behind,"" said Greste. ""Amidst all of this relief I still feel a sense of concern, a real sense of worry because ... if it's right for me to be free, then it's right for all of them to be free."" After spending more than a year in such close proximity -- ""in a box"" -- Greste says deep bonds were forged, making ""the moment of walking out of that prison, saying goodbye to those guys"" much more conflicted. ""Over that period I've got to know them... as family,"" he said. ""They're my brothers. It couldn't be any other way."" Still, he says that his release is a positive step, and he hopes that it signals a change in direction from the Egyptian government. ""The sense of euphoria, of optimism is so overwhelming,"" Greste said. ""What's very clear is that ... for Egypt too this is a big step forward. I think everyone has acknowledged that this is a very important moment and I just hope Egypt keeps going down this path with the others."" Sue Turton, an Al Jazeera English senior correspondent who was sentenced in absentia in Greste's trial, spoke to CNN's Hala Gorani about the possible release of the network's Cairo bureau chief Mohamed Fahmy. Fahmy had needed to take the drastic measure of renouncing his Egyptian citizenship in his bid for freedom, she said. ""He has now renounced that citizenship,"" she said. ""He was really coerced to do so. He was told by the Egyptian authorities that if this was going to happen he was going to have to give away his Egyptian passport."" It represented an extreme step for the journalist, who came ""from a very patriotic, proud military family,"" she said. ""This is a big deal for him. This isn't just a question of saying, 'Oh well. I'll just take a Canadian passport and that'll be that.' ""Now we're getting quite a lot of diplomatic messages through that it sounds like really his release is very imminent and he is pretty soon hopefully going to be on a plane headed to Canada."" Meanwhile, Greste's parents spoke to CNN's Christiane Amanpour about his release. His mother, Lois Greste, says that they initially weren't sure that the email that informed them of his release could be trusted. ""It was pretty difficult to take it in, that this was really going to happen,"" she said. ""But then a couple of hours later we got a call from Peter to say that he in the airport and about to hop onto the plane."" His father, Juris, confirmed that his son's release was a wholly unexpected development. ""He was just as surprised as anybody that he was asked to pack his small amount of gear and be ready to leave,"" he said, smiling. And now he's free? ""Juris suggested I put him over my knee and give him a whack,"" said his mother, laughing. But, she conceded, ""foreign correspondents have a habit"" of worrying their parents.","An Australian journalist is released after more than a year in Egyptian prison .

"Scientists are inviting you to take part in ""waking up"" a comet-chasing probe that has been in hibernation in space for nearly three years. The spacecraft  is due to reactivate itself from an internal alarm clock on Monday but to celebrate the event the European Space Agency (ESA) is asking people to film themselves shouting ""Wake up, Rosetta!"" and then share their video clips on a dedicated Facebook page. Visitors to the page can vote for their favorites and the top 10 will be transmitted towards Rosetta and out into the universe beyond. Behind the fun lies a ground-breaking mission, which, if successful, will notch up a series of notable firsts. Rosetta will be the first spacecraft to orbit a comet and to place a lander on the surface as it approaches and then swings around the sun. ESA says the mission's objective is to help understand the origin and evolution of the solar system and investigate the role that comets may have played in seeding Earth with water. Named after the Rosetta stone --- a block carved with ancient scripts that led to Egyptian hieroglyphs being deciphered -- the €1 billion ($1.36 billion) space mission was launched in 2004. Since then, ESA says it has been around the sun five times as controllers line it up to meet comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in August this year. For the last 31 months it has been in hibernation for the coldest part of the journey that took it close to the orbit of Jupiter. After mapping the comet's surface it will release the lander Philae in November and monitor changes as it gets closer to the sun. ESA project scientist Matt Taylor said if the project is successful it will advance the knowledge about comets. ""It's the first time we've made a rendezvous with a comet -- that's never been done before -- and it's going to be the first time we've escorted a comet past its closest approach to the Sun,"" he told CNN. ""The cherry on the cake is that we also deploy the lander to probe the surface of the comet. ""With these firsts it will enable us to make a quantum leap in our understanding of comets -- where they come from, their consistencies. ""Previous missions have only flown past comets at high speed. Rosetta will get within 5km (3.1 miles) when we deploy the lander and will be in pace with the comet -- we will be really up close and personal with it."" Taylor explained that the spacecraft was designed to be put in hibernation because even with massive solar panels the size of a basketball court, Rosetta would not have enough power to complete its mission without this energy-saving strategy. The lander is equipped with harpoons to attach itself to the comet, which is about 4km (2.5 miles) long, and then drill about 20cm (8 inches) into the surface to analyze the chemical components. Often described as ""dirty snowballs,"" comets are known to contain a lot of ice but scientists want to learn more about their exact composition. Barry Kellett, an astronomer and research scientist at the UK's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, explained that when comets approach the sun, the ice melts and is turned into an ionized gas tail. The dust produces a separate, curving tail. ""Astronomers believe comets are made of pristine solar system material before the solar system was formed,"" he said. ""They are the left over bits that never became a planet."" Some think that Earth may have received its water from comets, or even the chemicals that make up the building blocks of life on our planet. ""When Earth and Mars formed it would have been very hot so they would have formed dry,"" said Kellett. ""And it was certainly very hot when Earth was hit by something that made the Moon. The only things we know that have a large amount of water on them are comets."" He said if Rosetta can establish the composition of this comet then ""the question of where life came from might be better answered than before."" Rosetta's target comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is known as a short-period comet. It reappears every six years as its orbit brings it close to the Sun. Halley's comet has a period of about 76 years and is not due to return close enough to Earth to be visible until 2061. Others only return after thousands of years. Recently, comet ISON was mostly destroyed in its close encounter with the sun in November last year but it did provide scientists with fresh data in the process.

"It's been a month since violent clashes between opposition demonstrators and government forces in Venezuela first grabbed global attention. Protests rage on, and demonstrators show no sign of backing down. Medical sources at a hospital in Venezuela's Carabobo state said a student protester and a 42-year-old man were killed in clashes there Wednesday. State media accused violent right-wing groups of attacking a worker's march there. In a Twitter post, state Gov. Francisco Ameliach said a national guard captain had been killed in fighting, which he described as ""terrorism."" A government tally released Tuesday said at least 23 people had been killed nationwide and more than 200 others have been injured since protests started. The tally did not specify whether the casualties occurred among demonstrators or government forces, or both. Student protesters on both sides packed streets in Caracas Wednesday. State-run VTV showed pro-government demonstrators waving flags with the face of former President Hugo Chavez as they marched. Opposition student protesters also marched in the country's capital, CNN affiliate Globovision reported, calling for the resignation of the government's ombudsman. Violence surged this week in Tachira state, which borders Colombia. Government forces shot tear gas at opposition barricades there, and a well-known student leader was gunned down Monday. Daniel Tinoco, 24, was a university student studying mechanical engineering. He died after he was shot in the chest. Witnesses told CNN en Español that they were at a peaceful vigil with Tinoco in the city of San Cristobal when two white trucks with 10 armed passengers ambushed the protesters and open fire. The witnesses accused government intelligence services of being complicit in the shooting. Authorities have said they're investigating and denied reports that a government vehicle was involved in the shooting. The weeks of protests across Venezuela mark the biggest threat President Nicolas Maduro has faced since his election last year. Demonstrators say they have taken to the streets to protest shortages of goods, high inflation and high crime. Opposition protesters and government officials have traded blame for the violence for weeks. In an exclusive interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour last week, Maduro was unapologetic about his government's response to opposition protesters. Think about what the U.S. government would do if a political group laid out a road map for overthrowing President Barack Obama, Maduro said. ""What would happen in the United States if a group said they were going to start something in the United States so that President Obama leaves, resigns, to change the constitutional government of the United States?"" Maduro said. ""Surely, the state would react, would use all the force that the law gives it to re-establish order and to put those who are against the Constitution where they belong."" An opposition leader who encouraged protests, Leopoldo Lopez, remains behind bars, facing charges of arson and conspiracy. ""He created a road map to topple the legitimate government,"" Maduro told CNN last week. ""So now he's in jail and he has to go through justice."" But opposition demonstrators have argued that the government's approach of tamping down dissent is anything but just. ""No one accepts a monologue nor impositions from a government that has wanted to resolve the crisis with deaths, injuries, tortures, detentions and prisoners,"" opposition leader Henrique Capriles Radonski said in a Twitter post Wednesday. After a meeting in Santiago, Chile, to discuss the crisis in Venezuela, foreign ministers from the Union of South American Nations said they would send a special commission to support and advise a process of peaceful political dialogue in Venezuela. The group will have its first meeting by the first week in April, the statement said. The foreign ministers from Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname and Uruguay condemned the recent violence in Venezuela and expressed their solidarity ""with the families of the victims, with the people and with the democratically elected government of this sister nation."" In remarks broadcast on state-run VTV Tuesday night, Maduro said he would welcome a delegation from the regional body to help encourage dialogue in Venezuela. At a U.S. House hearing Wednesday, Secretary of State John Kerry said the U.S. government is prepared to sanction Venezuela if the situation worsens, but he also cautioned that the country's economy is already fragile. While the United States has voiced its concerns, other countries in the region are ""not listening to us, particularly, obviously,"" Kerry said. The Venezuelan government has continued efforts to blame the United States for problems there, he said, which makes it hard for ""us to be able to have the impact we'd like to have."" But still, Kerry said he hoped peer pressure from other South American nations could help resolve the crisis. ""I think the best hope right now is that the efforts of the neighboring countries, who are deeply concerned about what is happening and its impact on the region, may, may be able to encourage the kind of dialogue that could actually pave a way forward,"" he said. ""We've become an excuse. We're a card they play."" Venezuela cuts ties with Panama, calling country a 'lackey' for the U.S.","Three people are killed in clashes in Carabobo state .

"""Donetsk is a Russian city."" The chant rang out in the eastern Ukrainian city on Saturday, as thousands of pro-Russia demonstrators rallied beneath a towering statue of Soviet revolutionary Vladimir Lenin in the city's main square. They waved Russian flags and red flags emblazoned with the iconic image of Argentinian Marxist Che Guevara. There was not a single Ukrainian flag to be seen. ""They are frightened,"" said local journalist Denis Kazansky of pro-Ukraine protestors. ""They will not come out and demonstrate."" That's because just three days earlier, Lenin Square was the scene of violent clashes that left a 22-year-old, pro-Ukrainian activist dead. A floral tribute is the only evidence that remains of the bloodshed that unfolded Thursday night when a police cordon that stood between rival groups was breached. The tribute appeared a lonely site on Saturday as thousands of pro-Russia protesters stood with their backs to it. Their focus turned to a platform beneath the Lenin statue, where men and women took turns making their case for a referendum on the right to self-determination. Among the demonstrators was Vladimir Kosolapov, a local leader for the Communist Party in Ukraine. He told us that people in this eastern pocket of Ukraine supported the idea of federalism. ""We need more independence from Kiev for our region. Most people here don't think that power in Kiev is legitimate."" In the region, 48% are ethnic Russians and 46% are ethnic Ukrainian. Most speak Russian as their first language and feel closer historic ties to Moscow than Kiev. ""I am a citizen of Ukraine,"" said Kosolapov. ""I have the opportunity to leave Ukraine and go to Russia to my friends and relations but I don't want to go. I will not leave here because this is my home. My family is here. This is my parents' native land."" While those who support the new government in Kiev have only been holding sporadic rallies in Donetsk, pro-Russian demonstrators have a more permanent presence in Lenin Square. They have set up red tents from where they call for volunteers to join self-defense units and invite people to sign a petition and answer three questions. People queue to have their say beneath the Russian flags. Do you support a Customs Union? Yes. This is a trade agreement between Russia and some of the former Soviet republics. Do you want Russian to be an official language? Yes. Should Ukraine be a member of NATO? No. The local council had tried to ban any further demonstrations this weekend following the bloodshed on Thursday, but the Donetsk District Court rejected the request, saying there was no evidence of any danger to the public. Indeed, the rally in Lenin Square was peaceful on Saturday, though the demonstrators did bring traffic to a standstill when they decided to march through the streets and take their protest to the offices of the SBU, the Ukraine Security Services, which is loyal to Kiev. As riot police stood guard at the building entrance, the demonstrators called for the release of Pavel Gubarev, one of the leaders of the pro-Moscow protest movement who was arrested by the SBU on March 6, for leading a blockade at the regional administration building. There were reports of some property damage, but the demonstration did not escalate further. But it won't be an end to the pro-Russian fervor in Donetsk. Police were poised for more of the same with another major rally planned on Sunday in a show of support for the referendum in Crimea. Many in Donetsk want the same.","Protesters mainly pro-Russian in Donetsk, city in eastern Ukraine .

"Like a wounded animal lashing out in fury, ISIS is betraying hints of desperation in its latest video, which purportedly shows the aftermath of the beheading of U.S. hostage Peter Kassig, analysts said Sunday. And if there's news worse than the apparent brutal death of Kassig, it's that we should expect even more vicious videos to come from the group, also known by the acronym ISIL, said Haras Rafiq of the Quiliam Foundation, an anti-extremist think tank. ""As we see the U.S. and the coalition making gains against ISIL, we will find that they try and show that they are still strong, try and show that they are just as barbaric as they have been, and unfortunately one of the things we'll see is that the videos will become more and more barbaric,"" he said. ""I think it's a sign of desperation,"" he said. ""I think it's a sign that they know and feel they are under attack, they're under siege and they're struggling."" The video, released online Sunday, shows the aftermath of a beheading, in which the victim is not clearly recognizable. The White House confirmed that the video showed Kassig. Kassig, 26, who converted to Islam in captivity, also went by the name Abdul-Rahman Kassig. He went to the Middle East as a U.S. soldier and returned as a medical worker, feeling compelled to help victims of war. The video does show -- in gruesome detail -- the beheadings of what the group claims are pilots for the Syrian government, which is also battling ISIS forces. ""It can't be said enough,"" said CNN's Nic Robertson. ""This is the most barbaric they've done so far."" The carefully produced video is clearly ""a prize piece of propaganda for them,"" Robertson says. It also differs from others produced by ISIS. It doesn't feature a Western hostage dressed in orange speaking to the camera before his death. Nor does it name the group's next victim. It is likely in part meant to scare Syrians and Iraqis into obeying ISIS' orders when it comes calling, said Rafiq and retired U.S. Army Lt. Col. Joe Ruffini, a counterterrorism expert. ""What ISIS is telling them is, 'When we come in and tell you to do what we tell you, you know what the consequences are if you say no,'"" Ruffini said. But it also comes at a time when the United States and its anti-ISIS allies are claiming their airstrikes and support for ground forces fighting the group are beginning to slowly turn the tide, said retired U.S. Maj. Gen. James ""Spider"" Marks. Has ISIS peaked? Terror group suffers setbacks in Iraq . It also comes during a visit to Iraq by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey. ""Clearly there are no coincidences,"" Marks told CNN on Sunday. ""This is timed very specifically to those activities by the coalition and, I would say, the results of those activities."" Since beginning airstrikes in August, U.S. officials have touted successes in disrupting ISIS communications and logistics, slowing its advances and forcing fighters to disperse into smaller formations. Last week, President Barack Obama said the fight was entering a new phase that would rely heavily on Iraqi ground troops and other local fighters. More recently, U.S. officials have suggested more openness to a role for U.S. ground forces in the fight. In testimony to the House Armed Services Committee on Thursday, Dempsey said commanders are ""certainly considering"" the prospect that U.S. forces might be needed to retake the Iraqi city of Mosul, currently held by ISIS. In Sunday's video, the narrator taunted Obama to do just that. Hostages tortured before beheadings .","Video in part aimed at local residents, analysts say .

"Three Bangladeshi navy ships have begun searching the Bay of Bengal for traces of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, but have yet to find anything, a commander said Friday. The ships are operating off a tip from an Australian company that claims to have found possible traces of an underwater airplane wreck in the area. ""We haven't found anything yet, and the frigates will continue the search until they verify all available information,"" Commodore Rashed Ali, director of Bangladeshi navy intelligence, told CNN on Friday. Although Australian officials and other experts have derided the claim, acting Malaysian Transportation Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said he, too, is considering sending a ship to search -- even though he thinks it is ""highly unlikely"" the plane will be found in the Bay of Bengal. Hussein said the tip could be confirmed only by sending vessels to the area, which is thousands of kilometers away from the official search area in the southern Indian Ocean. ""But I just want to stress that by doing that, we are distracting ourselves from the main search,"" he said Friday. ""And in the event that the result from the search is negative, who is going to be responsible for that loss of time?"" His comments came three days after the Australian company GeoResonance publicized its claim that it may have found the wreckage of a plane in the bay. While GeoResonance said it's not sure whether the debris is from Flight 370, the company said it has been pressing officials to take a look. The chief coordinator of the international search effort said he doubts GeoResonance's claims. ""I am confident that the area in the southern (Indian) Ocean is the right search area, and I'm sure that in ... some time, we'll find the aircraft in that area of the Indian Ocean,"" chief coordinator Angus Houston said Friday. Houston said the search for the plane, which was carrying 239 people when it disappeared on March 8, may take eight to 12 months. MH370 report: Mixed messages ate up time before official search started . Next phase of the search . The Bluefin-21 drone finished its 18th underwater mission and found no debris of interest on the Indian Ocean floor, search officials said Friday. The drone's search area was set based on the findings of another device, a towed pinger locator, which had detected signals that officials believed were from the jet's flight data recorders. But no debris from the plane has been found. The search is entering a new phase, Hishammuddin said Friday. He said officials have had detailed talks with several Malaysian companies about deploying specialized assets such as deep-water towed side-scan sonars and remotely operated vehicles to join in the new phase of the mission. Families told to go home . After nearly two months of waiting at Beijing's Lido Hotel, relatives of Chinese passengers said Friday they've been told to leave. ""Chinese officials asked the family members to leave the hotel by 6 p.m. today,"" said Wang Yong Zhi, whose wife was on Flight 370. ""We don't have a choice."" More than 100 of the plane's passengers are Chinese, and the hotel has been a sentimental and informational hub for their families. Malaysia Airlines officials have been briefing families at the Lido over the past several weeks. On Thursday, some relatives wailed and yelled when the airline announced it was closing such assistance centers. ""Instead of staying in hotels, the families of MH370 are advised to receive information updates on the progress of the search and investigation and other support by Malaysia Airlines within the comfort of their own homes, with the support and care of their families and friends,"" the airline said in a news release. The hotel has seen an increased police and government presence over the past few days. Media have been barred from broadcasting within the hotel complex. ""What can we do?"" one relative yelled as others kneeled in front of police. Airline compensation . Wang said family members signed a letter, left fingerprints and agreed that a committee representing the families would continue working with Malaysia Airlines and the government on issues such as compensation. Under an international treaty known as the Montreal Convention, the airline must pay relatives of each deceased passenger an initial sum of around $150,000 to $175,000. Relatives of victims can also sue for further damages. Malaysia Airlines said Thursday it would begin making advance compensation to the Flight 370 passengers' next of kin to help with their immediate economic needs. But the airline didn't say how much of an advance the families would receive. Sarah Bajc, the American partner of Flight 370 passenger Philip Wood, said she was one of about 500 people at the Lido Hotel meeting Thursday. She said Chinese relatives had told her they dreaded the day that the hotel centers would close, fearing they wouldn't get timely updates at their rural homes. ""They are very distraught, because the average Chinese family member will be sent home to mostly a very rural place with limited access to (the) Internet,"" she said. ""They just feel like all lines of communications will be cut."" But some family members don't mind leaving the hotel. ""Nothing has changed for me, because living in Lido and living back home is the same to me,"" said Steve Wang, a relative of one of the passengers. ""We will move on to the next stage, and we will still keep on fighting for the truth and where the plane is and where our loved one is. We will keep on with it. We will never give up.""

"(CNN)Being a parent has suddenly become a lot more stressful. At least it has if you live in Taiwan. Lawmakers in the island have outlawed iPads and other electronic gadgets for children under the age of two, and demanded that those under the age of 18 do not use digital media for ""a period of time that is not reasonable."" Parents who fail to comply with the new ""Child and Youth Welfare Protection Act"" -- or rather, fail to enforce it upon their children -- may be fined 50,000 Taiwan dollars ($1,576). Now, as much as I dislike the excesses of bloated, interfering governments, I couldn't help but emit a yelp of joy when I read of these developments in Taiwan (which follow similar measures in China and South Korea). Of course, there are obvious difficulties with the legislation. For a start, it fails to define a ""reasonable"" length of time, leaving its application open to interpretation and abuse. Moreover, how can the law possibly be enforced? The government can hardly install some sort of spyware on every tablet and games console sold in the country. Most irritatingly of all, the measures also seem to ride roughshod over personal privacy. Dealing with the mother-in-law was bad enough. Now politicians are telling us how to parent our kids? (Talk about the ""nanny state""). Nevertheless, I couldn't help but feel that as a symbolic gesture, the new Taiwanese legislation is important. The fact is that doctors' advice on screen-time has been clear for years -- and for years, it has been comprehensively ignored by most parents. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the most influential body to have released such guidelines, recommends that ""television and other entertainment media should be avoided for infants and children under age two."" ""A child's brain develops rapidly during these first years, and young children learn best by interacting with people, not screens,"" it says. For older children, screen-time should be limited to two hours per day. The National Library of Medicine, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, points out that ""despite what ads may say, videos that are aimed at very young children do not improve their development."" Depressingly, however, the vast majority of parents are either unaware of the guidelines and dangers, or they simply disregard them. Research has shown that in the United States, children have between five and seven hours a day of screen-time, roughly triple the AAP's maximum. And British psychologist Aric Sigman says that the average seven-year-old will have spent the equivalent of an entire year in front of a screen. In Australia, a study called Virtually Impossible found that 45% of eight-year-olds and 80% of 16-year-olds exceed the recommended screen-time allowance. Let us be clear: the AAP guidelines might be rather black and white, but they are vitally important. Dismissing them, researchers believe, can cause children to have impaired brain development; an increased risk of attention problems, anxiety and depression; behavioral difficulties; obesity; sleep loss; poor academic performance; and physical complaints. Yet many parents continue to put their heads in the sand. Partly, the option of a digital babysitter is simply too tempting. In addition, there is a perception that electronic media can be beneficial or educational for children. As one study put it, ""the immediate practical advantages and believed educational benefits of entertaining children with screen media often override the long-term harm that many [parents] feel does not apply."" That's not to say that parents are devoid of good reasons to be skeptical. Every new medium, from novels to radio, has been accused of corrupting the young, and there could be something rather shrill in the medical establishment's opposition to digital media. It is indisputable that technology is increasingly dominating our lives; children who are able to write code or use Photoshop will have a significant advantage as adults. Furthermore, a number of academics have drawn a distinction between harmful and beneficial screen-time. Zero to Three, a nonprofit early childhood organization, argues that harm could be reduced if parents made screen-time ""a shared experience,"" and if children still had lots of time to play in the ""real, 3-D world."" Similarly, the Harvard Family Research Project has argued that ""young children may benefit from computer use"" if the software is sufficiently interactive and ""empowering."" But such studies can be exaggerated. It is worth noting, for instance, that even the Harvard study emphasizes that ""excessive screen time harms healthy growth and development, regardless of content"". And the AAP, which reviewed its guidelines in 2011, has not seen fit to significantly alter them. The fact remains that as a benchmark, the AAP guidelines deserve to be taken seriously. The alternative is to play Russian roulette with your child's wellbeing. Moreover -- and this is the important point -- the extent to which the guidelines are being smashed is massive. Most children in developed countries are consuming double, triple, or even quadruple the accepted healthy level of screen-time. Even the most educational app is unlikely to make a meaningful difference to that. There's no point in sugaring the pill. If kids aren't encouraged to unplug, they are likely to turn into some rather unhappy adults. This isn't something I say very often, but hurrah for the Taiwanese nanny state.","Lawmakers in Taiwan have outlawed iPads and other electronic gadgets for children under the age of two .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN)A South Korean military court has sentenced a sergeant to death for killing five members of his unit last year, authorities said Tuesday. The sergeant, surnamed Lim, threw a grenade and shot at his fellow soldiers at a base in a remote area near the heavily fortified border with North Korea in June. Two days later, surrounded by military forces, he was captured after shooting himself in the shoulder. ""Lim committed a tenacious and premeditated crime by killing even unarmed colleagues at the barracks,"" the chief judge of the military court said in the verdict Tuesday, according to the South Korean news agency Yonhap. ""Capital punishment is inevitable for such a hideous crime."" Military prosecutors had demanded the death penalty for Lim on charges of murder and desertion, Yonhap reported. A death sentence is effectively the equivalent of life in prison without parole in South Korea, where no executions have been carried out since 1997. Around 60 convicts are on death row in the country. Lim's case will go to appeal at a higher military court, Defense Ministry spokesman Kwon Ki-hyun told CNN. The soldier's defense lawyer said the court had ignored a lot of testimony about the bullying of his client at the barracks, according to Yonhap. Lim was three months from the end of his compulsory military service when he carried out the attack on his unit. He had been categorized as a soldier in need of special attention, according to the Defense Ministry. CNN's Paula Hancocks reported from Seoul, and Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong.","The sergeant threw a grenade and shot at his fellow soldiers last year .

"(CNN)Five years ago, the McStays were living the California dream. The family had moved into a new home in Fallbrook, and Joseph McStay's business was taking off. He had started a company called Earth Inspired Products that sold waterfalls, and online orders were strong. McStay connected with Chase Merritt, who manufactured custom indoor waterfalls. The two quickly bonded. ""We talked constantly. ... He came down and had dinner with me and my family once or twice a week virtually every week,"" Merritt told CNN's Randi Kaye. ""Joseph was my best friend."" It's a surprising statement considering where Merritt is now -- behind bars, charged with murder in the deaths of McStay; his wife, Summer; and their two small children, Gianni and Joseph Jr. The last time anyone heard from the McStay family was February 4, 2010. For years, no one knew what happened to them. Police who searched their home days after the family disappeared found eggs on the kitchen counter and bowls of popcorn in the living room, along with the family's two dogs. There were no signs of a struggle. The bodies of the McStay family were found in the Mojave Desert in November 2013. Police say they believe the family died of ""blunt force trauma."" Merritt, who is now representing himself, has pleaded not guilty. A preliminary hearing has been set for April 7. No trial date has been scheduled yet. But investigators are confident they have the right man. From the start of the case, San Bernardino County detectives had their eyes on Merritt, a talented welder who was known for his laid-back, cowboy demeanor. Joseph McStay's father, Patrick, teamed up with Gina Watson, who knew his son through work. The two did their own investigating and came across what they say are some troubling inconsistencies. Merritt has said he was the last person to see McStay alive. The two, Merritt said, met for a business lunch in Rancho Cucamonga the day the family disappeared. ""I am definitely the last person he saw,"" Merritt told Kaye in January 2014. Asked if McStay was concerned about anything, Merritt said, ""No, no, no. He seemed happy."" But Patrick McStay told CNN that Merritt told him Joseph was upset about a damaged fountain Merritt built for him. Joseph McStay also told his father he was frustrated with Merritt's work. ""Joey had talked about the quality of some of the fountains had slipped. And Joey wasn't happy with that,"" Patrick McStay said. ""Because he was getting complaints."" Joseph McStay had talked to his father about getting another welder. Merritt also told CNN about receiving a call from McStay the night he disappeared. Merritt said he didn't remember the call until his then-girlfriend reminded him about it. The call came, he said, when they were watching television. Merritt picked up the phone, looked at it and set it back down.   He was tired, he said. But when Patrick McStay asked about the call, Merritt said it was a follow-up to their conversation at lunch. San Bernardino County District Attorney Michael Ramos said he can't yet say what the motive was, but he said his team had been watching Merritt on a daily basis. ""We know there have been many inconsistencies,"" Ramos said. ""His story is all over the place."" Still, the case against Merritt may have holes. Merritt told CNN he went to the McStay house after the family went missing and before it was sealed off. Officers believe the McStays were killed in the home, but 11 days passed between the family's disappearance and an alert to the sheriff's department. It took San Diego investigators three days to obtain the warrants they needed to complete a full search, and during that time, the home remained unsealed. How reliable is evidence gathered at the McStay house so many days after investigators say the family was killed there? Could one person kill a family of four and bury the bodies 100 miles away? And the fact that it has been five years since the family went missing does not make the prosecution's case any easier. ""I think the biggest obstacle ... is time. Because witnesses forget, people forget the time frames, what occurred, etc.,"" Ramos said.","Chase Merritt has pleaded not guilty to four counts of murder .

"Jerusalem (CNN)Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed the resignation Tuesday of the head of a U.N. inquiry into alleged war crimes during last summer's conflict between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza. Netanyahu said that Prof. William Schabas ""was biased against Israel"" and that the commission of inquiry's as yet unpublished report was written at the behest of the U.N. Human Rights Council, which the Prime Minister described as ""an anti-Israel body."" He said the report, due to be presented to the U.N. Human Rights Council in March, should be shelved. ""This is the same council that in 2014 made more decisions against Israel than against Iran, Syria and North Korea combined,"" he added. Netanyahu said that Israel acted in accordance with international law during Operation Protective Edge and that it was ""Hamas, the other terrorist organizations and the terrorist regimes around us that need to be investigated, not Israel."" Israel's Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman also accused Schabas of bias -- saying his nomination was ""like appointing Cain to investigate who murdered Abel"" -- and welcomed his resignation, describing it as ""another achievement of Israeli diplomacy."" Schabas, a Canadian-born professor of international law based in London, was appointed by the U.N. Human Rights Council to head the three-person commission of inquiry in August. The council said its task was ""to investigate all violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, particularly in the occupied Gaza Strip, in the context of the military operations conducted since 13 June 2014."" This includes looking at the activities of Palestinian armed groups in Gaza, including attacks on Israel, as well as the Israeli military operation in Gaza and the West Bank, it said. The United Nations has said more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the conflict in Gaza. According to U.N. estimates, at least 70% of the Palestinians killed were civilians, but Israel reports a higher number of militants among the dead. On the Israeli side, there were 68 casualties, 65 of them soldiers and three civilians.","Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says William Schabas ""was biased against Israel""

"(CNN)  -- A cruise ship resumed its voyage to Cozumel, Mexico, on Tuesday after the Coast Guard released it from the search for a 50-year-old woman believed to have fallen overboard late Monday. Passengers on the Carnival cruise ship Holiday were told that the missing person had not been found. The Coast Guard identified the woman as Michelle Vilborg of Bay Minette, Alabama. Two Coast Guard ships, two planes and a helicopter had been searching an area of more than 1,200 square miles about 75 miles south-southwest of Pensacola, Florida. A U.S. Coast Guard spokesman told CNN the search began after a crew member heard a loud splash near the vessel late Monday. The Holiday, which sailed from Mobile, Alabama, stopped and passengers were told to return to their cabins for a head count, a passenger said. On Tuesday, a note from the ship's captain, Carmelo Marino, was slipped under the doors of passenger cabins, briefing them on the situation. After circling in Gulf waters Tuesday, the Holiday was released by the Coast Guard about noon. The Coast Guard continued searching for the missing woman. Vilborg is believed to have fallen about 10:30 p.m. Monday, and boats were launched from the cruise ship to search nearby waters. The Coast Guard said it joined the search around 11 p.m. In a separate incident Monday, rescuers found a passenger who had fallen off another Carnival cruise ship. The man had climbed a railing for a better a view of the scenery and slipped into the water near Tampa, Florida, the Coast Guard said. The passenger was found clinging to a sea buoy and was taken to a hospital with cuts on his arms. CNN's Ed Payne and Samuel Gardner contributed to this report.","Authorities suspect passenger fell overboard from Carnival ship Holiday .

"(CNN)President Obama's new budget includes a mixed bag of tax reforms, including progressive proposals to create a fairer income tax, as well as misguided corporate giveaways. On the individual side, he would increase taxes on the very wealthiest Americans to pay for tax cuts for lower- and middle-income Americans, including limiting tax benefits of itemized deductions for the best-off Americans, scaling back gigantic tax breaks for capital gains and large estates, and ensuring that hedge-fund managers pay their fair share. Each of these steps would reduce glaring inequities in our tax laws that allow the Warren Buffets of the world to pay lower tax rates than their secretaries. On the tax-cutting side, Obama would expand tax credits for child-care and education expenses, boost the earned-income tax credit for childless workers, and give a new tax break to two-earner couples. Critically, these tax cuts would be paid for by the loophole-closers already mentioned. Unfortunately, these sensible proposals are almost certainly dead on arrival in the GOP-led Congress. But on the corporate side, the president's plans actually have a chance of being taken seriously by congressional Republicans — possibly because his ideas are more in line with the ideological push for lower corporate tax rates. The president's plan would impose a one-time 14% tax on the $2 trillion in untaxed income that multinational companies collectively have stashed in tax havens. While 14% is certainly higher than the single-digit rate companies such as Apple and Microsoft have paid to date on their offshore cash, it's still a lot less than the 35% these companies should be paying on their profits, and it's less than what many other businesses are already dutifully paying. Members of Congress have made similar proposals, including Sens. Barbara Boxer and Rand Paul, who recently proposed taxing foreign profits at 6.5%. Put another way, the president and lawmakers' theory on taxing offshore profits appears to be ""getting something is better than nothing."" But we can do better. In the wake of a titanic debate last year over what should happen to the corporate tax rate, Obama's budget is equally notable for failing to include a comprehensive proposal to eliminate tax giveaways. The President has said that he wants a revenue-neutral corporate tax change that collects the same amount of revenue by lowering the corporate tax rate while eliminating loopholes. But his budget proposal is silent on how to accomplish this goal. The goal of corporate tax reform should be raising more revenue, not the same amount. Measured as a share of the economy, the U.S. corporate tax is lower than almost every other developed nation -- and our corporate tax collections are at nearly their lowest point since World War II. This decline has been driven by rampant tax avoidance by big multinational corporations. Citizens for Tax Justice released a report which found that 111 Fortune 500 corporations have found a way to pay zero corporate income taxes in at least one of the last five years despite being consistently profitable. And more than 70% of the Fortune 500 companies now have subsidiaries in foreign tax havens. All of which makes it even more absurd that President Obama would reward these tax dodgers with a special low tax rate on their foreign cash hoard. There is some good in the president's tax reform proposal. In particular, the low-income tax credits will encourage work and pull millions of workers out of poverty. Unfortunately, it is hard to imagine these ideas receiving a real hearing this year. But the President's plan to lower the corporate tax rate and reward companies that stash their profits offshore with a lower tax rate -- coupled with his budget's lack of detail on a road map to eliminating corporate loopholes -- signals there is fertile ground for compromise that would fail to achieve a fair and sustainable corporate tax.","Robert McIntyre: Obama's progressive plans to create a fairer income tax won't get through GOP-led Congress .

"(CNN)More than 100 people in 14 states were reported to have measles last month, with most cases linked to exposure to the disease at Disneyland from December 15 to December 20. President Obama urged parents to make sure their children are vaccinated. And yet three potential Republican candidates for the 2016 presidential election have suggested in recent days that parents should have a choice in whether children should be vaccinated. When we are not exposed to the suffering that childhood infectious diseases can cause or didn't experience them ourselves, we as a society tend to forget just how dangerous they can be. In 1938, President Franklin Roosevelt founded the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, now known as the March of Dimes Foundation. Children and adults everywhere collected dimes to raise money for the development of a polio vaccine. There was such fear about the disease that children were kept from going to community swimming pools and parks. Their way of life was changed by the disease. Today, in contrast, we don't seem to be alarmed at all. Federal research funds, the major source of funding to support research by immunologists, virologists, and other scientists who create the vaccines that protect us, were 22% less in 2014 than they were in 2003 when adjusted for inflation. Why was everyone so gung-ho to raise money for research then but not now? Because we forgot. We forgot that the ""black death"" plague of the 14th century wiped out 60% of Europeans. We forgot that smallpox killed 30% of people who got sick before a vaccine was available. We also forgot that the smallpox vaccination campaign was so successful that the last case of smallpox in the United States was in 1949, and, with the exception of two vials in storage, it was eliminated from the planet in 1977.  By forgetting the sheer horror these diseases inflicted on humanity and the decisive way in which vaccines eliminated them, it's easy to forget how fragile we are. In 1954, the first polio vaccine became available. Parents jumped at the chance to enroll their children in a vaccine trial that eventually included 1.8 million children from 44 states. Those parents saw children crippled by the polio virus; they saw images of iron lungs that breathed for a child because the child's own lungs were effectively paralyzed. Those parents willingly enrolled their children in the trial despite not knowing if their child would be in the group that received the vaccine or the control group that did not. They were terrified enough that the benefit outweighed the risk. More recently however, for some parents, the risk has outweighed the benefit. They have become complacent. Maybe they bought into disproven science about a link between autism and vaccines. Maybe they think because they have not seen anyone with polio, that their child is safe. Our collective historical amnesia has led to increased numbers of unvaccinated children, and we are all worse off for it. The recent outbreak at Disneyland will hopefully boost our collective memory as to how contagious a virus can be. The 102 cases reported in January is a staggering number when we consider that for the past decade, the average total number of cases in a year was under 150. Many, but not all, of these cases were in individuals who did not receive the full course of childhood vaccinations, making us realize that any one of us could be at risk. Given that there are only a limited number of doctors still around that have ever seen a patient with measles, or remember diagnosing a case of measles decades ago, only compounds the problem and aids the spread of disease. The unfortunate reality is that it may take the occasional serious outbreak to provide that reminder to all of us how quickly we can be overcome by something as tiny as a virus. Today's tourist destinations are just like the pools and parks when polio was rampant, places for the virus to find new victims. Viruses don't care about borders and easily hitch rides around the world in a matter of hours. We can't protect against every infectious disease, but why should we risk getting sick from diseases, especially measles, for which we have safe and effective vaccines? We can all hope that parents will see this as a wake-up call and vaccinate their children, and that all of us will make sure we are up to date on our boosters. Hopefully, the memory of these events will not fade so we won't need a reminder like the measles outbreak of 2015 again any time soon.","102 cases of measles were reported last month in the United States .

"(CNN)Don't call it ""Monopoly money."" Not in France, anyway. As part of the 80th anniversary of Monopoly's first appearance in France, Hasbro is issuing a handful of special sets in that country with real euros in place of the colorful paper it usually offers. Of the 80 special sets, 69 will have five 10-euro notes and five 20-euro notes, another 10 will come with five 20-euro, two 50-euro and one 100-euro bills, and one set will have a complete bank drawer of real cash. That's 20,580 euros -- or about $23,650 at current exchange rates -- for whomever buys the lucky box. CNN asked Hasbro whether a similar plan was in the works for the United States -- where the game is also celebrating its 80th anniversary, at least under a corporate parent -- but has yet to hear back. Nevertheless, it's a game that's compiled a lot of big numbers (and quite a bit of cash) on its own. Consider these impressive facts courtesy of Hasbro: . - More than 275 million sets have been sold worldwide. - Monopoly is available in 111 countries in 43 languages. (Many of those sets substitute local landmarks for the familiar Atlantic City street names.) - San Francisco jeweler Sidney Mobell is responsible for the most expensive Monopoly set, a $2 million game with a golden board and diamond-studded dice. - The longest game on record lasted for 70 days. That was on terra firma; Monopoly has also been played underwater and in a treehouse. - There are 32 houses and 12 hotels in a standard Monopoly set. - A Monopoly board has 40 spaces, including 28 properties. Yes, that includes the railroads. - The lowest rent in Monopoly? Mediterranean Avenue with no houses (assuming its owner doesn't also own Baltic Avenue). It'll cost you $2 to land on it. The most expensive? Boardwalk with a hotel, worth a cool $2,000. - In 2008, more than 3,000 people played the game at the same time, a record. And not one of them overturned the board in disgust.","French version of Monopoly has some sets with actual euros .

"London (CNN)Lawmakers on Tuesday voted in favor of a law that sets the stage for the United Kingdom to be the first country in the world to allow a pioneering in vitro fertilization technique using DNA from three people. The technique could prevent mitochondrial diseases but also raises significant ethical issues. The measure was passed in the House of Commons, 382 to 128, Speaker John Bercow said. A further vote must be held in the UK's upper house, the House of Lords, before the measure can become law. Passage of the law is opposed by Catholic and Anglican church leaders, in part because the process involves the destruction of an embryo. One in 6,500 babies in the United Kingdom are thought to develop a serious mitochondrial disorder, which can lead to health issues such as heart and liver disease, respiratory problems, blindness and muscular dystrophy. Problems with mitochondria, the ""powerhouse"" cells of the body, are inherited from the mother, so the proposed IVF treatment would mean an affected woman could have a baby without passing on mitochondrial disease. But the cutting-edge IVF technique, which involves transferring nuclear genetic material from a mother's egg or embryo into a donor egg or embryo that's had its nuclear DNA removed, raises ethical questions. The new embryo will contain nuclear DNA from the intended father and mother, as well as healthy mitochondrial DNA from the donor embryo -- effectively creating a ""three-parent"" baby. The amount of donor DNA in the mitochondria will, however, be much less than the parental DNA in the nucleus, which determines the baby's characteristics. The Church of England's national adviser on medical issues, the Rev. Dr. Brendan McCarthy, described the step as representing an ethical watershed and said more research and wider debate were needed. ""We accept in certain circumstances that embryo research is permissible as long as it is undertaken to alleviate human suffering and embryos are treated with respect. We have great sympathy for families affected by mitochondrial disease and are not opposed in principle to mitochondrial replacement,"" he said. ""Our view, however, remains that we believe that the law should not be changed until there has been further scientific study and informed debate into the ethics, safety and efficacy of mitochondrial replacement therapy."" Bishop John Sherrington, in a statement posted online by the Catholic Church in England and Wales, urged lawmakers not to rush into taking such a serious step. ""It seems extraordinary that a licence should be sought for a radical new technique affecting future generations without first conducting a clinical trial,"" he said. ""There are also serious ethical objections to this procedure which involves the destruction of human embryos as part of the process."" The California-based Center for Genetics and Society, in an open letter to UK lawmakers last month, said that although the proposed goal was noble, ""the techniques will in fact put women and children at risk for severe complications, divert resources from promising alternatives and treatments, and set a policy precedent that experimentation on future generations is an acceptable biomedical/fertility development."" A team at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Mitochondrial Research, led by professor Doug Turnbull and based at Newcastle University in northern England, has been leading the research into the pioneering IVF technique. The center points out that mitochondrial diseases cannot be cured and that in many families, several people are affected. A Wellcome Trust fact sheet states that ""nuclear DNA is not altered, and so mitochondrial donation will not affect the child's appearance, personality or any other features that make a person unique -- it will simply allow the mitochondria to function normally and the child to be free of mitochondrial DNA disease. ""The healthy mitochondria will also be passed on to any children of women born using the technique."" According to the latest estimates from the research team, published in The New England Journal of Medicine, almost 2,500 women of childbearing age in the UK are at risk of transmitting mitochondrial disease to their children, while in the United States, the number is more than 12,400. This equates to an average of 152 births per year in the UK, and 778 births per year in the United States, the team said. In a Newcastle University news release, Turnbull said his team's findings had considerable implications for other countries considering the technique. Allowing it would give ""women who carry these mutations greater reproductive choice,"" he said. CNN's Alexander Felton, Laura Perez-Maestro and Debra Goldschmidt contributed to this report.","UK lawmakers vote overwhelmingly in favor of allowing the new IVF technique .

"London (CNN)A French journalist's ISIS captors cared little about religion, Didier Francois -- who spent over 10 months as the group's prisoner in Syria -- told CNN's Christiane Amanpour in an exclusive interview on Tuesday. ""There was never really discussion about texts or -- it was not a religious discussion. It was a political discussion."" ""It was more hammering what they were believing than teaching us about the Quran. Because it has nothing to do with the Quran."" ""We didn't even have the Quran; they didn't want even to give us a Quran."" Francois was released in April last year, but has only rarely spoken about his ordeal. He is one of the rare ISIS hostages who was freed. Among those still held by ISIS is an American woman, U.S. President Barack Obama acknowledged this weekend in an interview with NBC News. Francois told Amanpour that he had met her twice. He was reluctant to get into details, lest anything jeopardize her safety. In general, he said, women ""had a bit more freedom of movement,"" but being an ISIS hostage is ""frightening enough,"" and ""being a woman doesn't make it easier."" Francois saw unimaginable horrors while detained. When ISIS held him in an Aleppo hospital, he routinely heard and saw the aftermath of his captors' torture of local Syrians and Iraqis who fell afoul of their hardline rules. ""We could see some of them in the corridors when we were taken to the toilets,"" he said, ""and we could see some people lying in their blood."" ""You could see the chains hanging, or the ropes hanging, or the iron bars."" Francois is matter of fact when describing his own treatment. ""Of course we were beaten up. But it was not every day. I mean, it's hard enough -- you don't have to overplay it."" ""It's hard enough to lose your freedom. It's hard enough to be in the hands of people who you know are killing hundreds and thousands of local Syrians, Iraqis, Libyans, Tunisians, can put bombs in our countries."" ""It's terrifying enough. The beating is strong, but it's not every day. It happens sometimes."" ""If they wanted to wreck you, they could. None of us would have been able to go through if it was beating every day, and torture every day."" Through ISIS's brutal executions of Western journalists, one anonymous fighter has seared himself into the world's consciousness -- nicknamed ""Jihadi John"" for his distinctly British accent. Francois knew Jihadi John while in captivity; he was one of the guards. ""You can see on the video -- he's not somebody you'd like to have to deal with."" The British jihadis, nicknamed ""The Beatles"" by the hostages, were ""harsher in their violence,"" he said. They were, he told Amanpour, more extreme -- the food the Brits gave them was better, ""but the beating was harsher."" Jihadists from the former French colonies in North Africa, or the Maghreb, were also comparatively harsh in their treatment of French captives, Francois said. They ""were much more keen to [put] the French hostages in the same groups as the Americans and the British, and not negotiate for us,"" Francois said. Francois was released just before ISIS made its shocking sweep through Iraq, capturing vast amounts of territory. Indeed, he now says, he does not believe he and his three colleagues would be released were they still in ISIS hands, ""especially with France involved in the coalition and bombing in Iraq."" ""We were lucky."" When he went to Syria, he told Amanpour, a journalist or NGO worker's capture was not reported, so it was hard to know just how dangerous it was. ""So we didn't know the level of the risk, or we didn't realize the level of the risk at the time. Plus it was the time when the people from ISIS were still hiding within Jabhat al-Nusra and didn't organize their kind of coup within al Qaeda."" Unlike the United States and the United Kingdom, many European countries are believed to pay ransom for hostages held by terrorist groups, including ISIS. France has publicly denied paying a ransom for the journalists' release. ""It's never only a question of money,"" Francois said, calling speculation in the media about amounts of money that may have been paid ""utterly ridiculous."" Francois was held captive with James Foley, the journalist whose brutal execution fby ISIS -- and the video that followed -- was the first in a sickening line. ""James was an amazing friend,"" Francois said. ""He never gave up. He had a fantastic heart."" ""He was always trying to get things for the others."" When guards asked the hostages if they needed anything, they would all reflexively reply no, not wanting to rock the boat. Foley, by contrast, would suggest perhaps they could have some vegetables to vary their diet. ""They didn't like the fact that he was not broken. And that's the reason why he was getting more beaten. Because he was not broken. He was still fighting, in his way. He was still arguing."" When Foley was so gruesomely murdered, Jihadi John was seen in an ISIS propaganda video putting a knife to the journalist's neck. The actual beheading was not shown on camera, leading to speculation about whether Jihadi John was actually behind the killing. Francois told Amanpour he believes it was Jihadi John who committed the murder. As a former captive, Francois has incredible perspective on the inner workings of an opaque and new organization. ""The Iraqi and the Syrian people who join ISIS are much more traditional conservative kind of guys from the tribes."" ""And sometimes it's not easy for them to fit with the jihadis coming from other countries, because they don't share the same ideas, they don't share the same behaviors, they don't have the same codes. And sometimes it's really tense between them."" Unlike al Qaeda, from which ISIS was cleft, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi ""is always trying to root his organization in the local conflict."" ""He always tries to push the Sunni tribes, the Bedouins, to fight against the Shiite, or the Yazidi, or the Christians. And they trying to play communities one against the others. That's how he survives. That's how he recruits."" ""He is using, of course, those young guys coming from Europe or coming from all over the place. But it's only one part of his organization. The strongest parts of his organization are the tribes, the local Sunni tribes."" Survival, he said, was a matter of trying to exist ""in between those.""","Didier Francois says his ISIS captors ""didn't want even to give us a Quran""

"German authorities have asked pop star Justin Bieber to hand over nearly $8,000 for the costs of caring for the capuchin monkey he left behind in Munich after bringing it on tour without the right paperwork. The bill covers the cost of vaccinations, accommodation and transport for the monkey, known as Mally, which is now being cared for at a zoo in northern Germany. Customs officials posted a public notice of the bill after failing to get a response from Bieber at the address he gave to customs officials, said Martin Brandlhuber, a customs spokesman at Munich's airport. In light of that, German authorities have followed the applicable laws and made the claim publicly known, he said. Bieber must pay up the next time he comes to Germany or risk being denied entry, Brandlhuber said. If he is unable to pay cash, then customs officials could confiscate other property to meet the claim, Brandlhuber said. Alternatively, Bieber could be denied entry and be required to provide a valid address. The young monkey was taken to a Munich animal shelter after it was confiscated at the end of March as Bieber arrived in Germany on a European tour. Mally was transferred to the Serengeti Park in Hodenhagen, near Hanover, in June after spending several weeks in quarantine. Bieber had until May 7 to present the paperwork to reclaim his pet but failed to do so, zoo spokeswoman Juliane Gunkel said last month. As a result, Mally is now the property of the German government, and the Serengeti Park is acting as the caretaker. The park was picked because it is the only zoo in Germany that has a family of capuchins for Mally to join. Bieber's representatives declined to comment at the time the animal was confiscated.

"A third successive year of California's worst drought in a century has the Golden State's reservoirs at record lows. Agriculture has been affected, hitting the local economy, while some small communities risk running out of water. But business is booming in California's Orange County Water District (OCWD), through a pioneering wastewater treatment facility that recycles used water -- or sewage -- and returns it to the drinking supply. The plant is expanding production from 70 to 100 million gallons per day, enough for 850,000 people, around one-third of the county population. As the OWCD output is mixed with the main groundwater supply it reaches over 70% of residents. Global problem . The facility is among the oldest and largest of its type in the world, and could represent a model solution for a global problem. The U.N. warns that half the world population will face water scarcity by 2030, accelerated by climate change and population growth. Shortages on such a scale would threaten food production, as well as a health crisis through increased exposure to unsanitary water, which already kills millions each year through waterborne diseases such as cholera and diarrhea. But the introduction of reuse systems has been difficult, with a high degree of public skepticism. Orange County began recycling water for non-potable use in the 1970s, but only began contributing to the drinking supply in 2008, combined with a comprehensive PR and education campaign to allay public fears. Operators now feel the system is well established and ready to scale up. ""It's a watershed moment right now, we're seeing widespread acceptance of these technologies,"" OCWD General Manager Mike Markus said. ""As the shortages become more extreme and water supplies are cut, it has raised awareness that we need to find alternative resources."" The process works by re-routing a proportion of the 1.3 billion gallons of waste water generated in Southern California each day into a three-step treatment. The first is microfiltration of the treated waste water to remove solids, oils and bacteria, before the resulting liquid goes through reverse osmosis, pushing it through a fine plastic membrane that filters out viruses and pharmaceuticals. The water is then treated with UV light to remove any remaining organic compounds, before joining the main groundwater supply, which must pass strict quality controls to meet legal standards, and distribution to households. Read this: Machine makes drinking water from thin air . The OCWD says the water exceeds all state and federal drinking water standards. Safety has also been established in pioneering projects around the world. Water-insecure Singapore, previously reliant on imports, now delivers 30% of its needs through the NEWater reclamation facility. Although only a small amount is added to its reservoirs, the output surpasses WHO standards for potable use to the extent that a high proportion is directed for industrial uses requiring ultra-clean water. One of the world's earliest schemes, in Windhoek, Namibia, has been in operation since 1968 and has tackled both shortage and water-borne diseases. Over half of the Sub Saharan African population faces water insecurity, and the greatest health risk, diarrhea, kills over a million people each year in the region. But research showed that in the 1970s disease occurred at lower rates for people supplied by the Windhoek plant than through conventional treated sources. ""Standards are stricter because of the novelty of the technology and process,"" says Benedito Braga, President of the World Water Council. ""The quality from sewage is very good, as good or better than the tap water in any city in the developed world."" The message is now being heeded and the model is spreading. California has put $1 billion into funding recycling for potable use ($800 million of that in low-interest loans), with new initiatives launched in Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego. Texas, parts of which are also severely affected by drought, aims to generate 10% of all new supplies through reclaimed water by 2060. A facility in Big Spring has introduced the first ""Direct Potable Reuse"" scheme in the United States by sending recycled water to the final treatment plant without passing it through groundwater reserves. Dealing with disgust . In each case, public relations are key, as recycled water schemes have been historically shot down by public disgust at the concept. This was most vividly shown in the Australian city of Toowoomba in 2006 when local activists represented by the group ""Citizens against drinking sewage"" defeated plans to introduce reclaimed sources, citing health risks and emotive factors. But Australia also shows the extent to which attitudes have changed. After a three-year public trial, the city of Perth will receive up to 20% of its drinking water from reclaimed sources in coming decades, with a reported 76% public support. A network of similar programs is being established across the country, according to the Australian Water Recycling Center of Excellence. Psychologists say the aversion is deeply held and difficult -- but not impossible -- to overcome. ""The disgust comes from intuitive concepts of contagion,"" says Dr. Carol Nemeroff of the University of South Maine, who has studied reactions to reclaimed water. ""It is magical in nature, the same type of thinking that underlines voodoo practices."" ""One of the best ways to get past it is perceptual cues -- if you can see sparkling fresh, clear water, and taste it that helps to overcome the concept ... the contagion type thinking decreases with familiarity,"" says Nemeroff, adding that necessity can also be a key driver. ""If you're desperate you'll override anything for survival."" Energy and cost . In Orange County and other facilities, mixing the output with groundwater is a largely unnecessary, confidence-building measure to allay public fears. But as awareness improves, operators hope to move from indirect to direct potable reuse, which would bring down energy use and costs, while avoiding the counter-intuitive step of re-contaminating purified water. ""The main cost is energy and that is coming down all the time,"" says Mike Markus. ""Improvements in membrane technology allow us to use less pressure to do the same thing."" The energy cost of reverse osmosis has come down by 75% since the 1970s, he says, while emerging technologies such as Aquaporin may reduce it further. Even now, the cost is favorable compared with desalination or imported water in California. Markus hopes such advances will allow for the creation of portable modular units that can be cheaply transported to the areas of the world with the greatest need. Campaign group Water Reuse does much of its work in education outreach, through messages such as the ""Downstream"" concept, that all water is ultimately recycled. ""It's the same water now as when dinosaurs walked the earth,"" says executive director Melissa Meeker. ""It's about understanding the water cycle and how we fit into it. Once people think about it, they become more open-minded."" If costs continue to fall and public acceptance continues to grow, waste water can become a major defense against the projected scarcities of this century. The World Water Council projects that recycled sewage will be a normalized source of drinking water in cities around the world within 30 years, and much of the infrastructure and technology is already in place. It's up to us now to get used to it.","U.S. and beyond increasingly looking to reusing sewage water for drinking .

"(CNN)Just when you think ISIS cannot horrify any more than it has, the group sends us to a new level of disbelief. The latest news from the Middle East -- the release of a video allegedly showing the Jordanian pilot Moath al-Kasasbeh deliberately burned alive by his captors -- is the latest example. How can we comprehend human beings behaving in this way? The highly produced videos of decapitations have continued coming, and now this. It's tempting to think this is the work of a small number within ISIS, perhaps a core of psychopaths, given free rein by the so-called Islamic State's leaders. But these are not isolated incidents. This is much more. This is a very deliberate policy of a strategically coherent group that has defeated armies and captured and held a significant swath of the Middle East. This is ISIS very deliberately pursuing a policy that it believes will help it achieve its ultimate objectives. These are acts of brutality by an organization that has sought to make ruthlessness one of its most distinctive characteristics. Indeed, far from apologizing for its inhumanity, ISIS advertises it proudly, it taunts the world with it, and goes to great lengths to confirm that the acts that horrify us are not the work of rogue members but are, indeed, the organization's policy. Cruelty is a key component of the ISIS brand. The group has managed to conquer large parts of Syria and Iraq with a systematic and efficient plan. Like everything else it does, broadcasting barbarism is a calculated strategy. But why? Brutality has psychological, strategic and ideological objectives. That's why other fighting forces have resorted to cruelty to achieve their objectives. History is replete with examples that we see echoed today. As we avert our eyes from the carnage, from beheadings, mass executions and crucifixions; as we try to avoid looking at the worst of the online videos, it is apparent that the strategy has the potential to create a huge and powerful backlash. That cruelty is turning much of the world, including Arabs and Muslims, against ISIS. And the atrocities against American and other Western citizens are all but inviting the world's most powerful armies to take on the Islamist militias. And yet, by showing its fighters massacring the enemy without mercy, by flooding social media with the gruesome images, ISIS sends several messages that its leaders believe bring benefits that outweigh the risks. Long before we heard what happened to American hostage James Foley back in August, months before we learned that ISIS had killed hundreds of men, women and children of Iraq's Yazidi minority, burying some of them alive, the people of the Middle East had become acquainted with the mass executions, the brutal persecution of minorities, the killing of Christians, of Shiites, and of Sunnis or anyone else who posed a challenge, hesitated to follow its religious dictates, or resisted the ISIS advance in Syria and then Iraq. Cruelty communicates fearlessness, and fearlessness, coupled with battlefield success, is an irresistible draw. It's no wonder ISIS has attracted large numbers of men eager to fight, including hundreds from Europe. They share the goal, as one defector told CNN, of establishing an Islamic state in the Arab world and then taking the campaign to other countries. Beheading the enemy is an effective recruiting appeal to a small but not insignificant segment of the population that is enticed by the brazenness and ideological fervor. To them, mostly young Muslim men, the barbarism resonates with their own brand of hatred and lust for revenge: revenge over real or perceived slights against Muslims. The religious justification for the executions, described by ISIS as part of its jihad -- a war to return the reign of an Islamic caliphate and impose the Quran's dictates -- gives the killings moral, theological clearance, all but precluding empathy toward nonmembers. In addition, by advertising its methods, ISIS intimidates the armies it faces, causing some soldiers to flee before battle, even leaving their weapons behind, as we saw when ISIS took over Mosul. The executions of hundreds of enemy soldiers, those who chose to fight, have appeared in videos, a warning to others. And the method also works to keep populations in line after ISIS takes over territory and enforces its rule. Of course, ISIS is not the first organization to use barbarism as a weapon of war; to use cruelty as a method of policy enforcement. In the Middle Ages, the Inquisition, an institutionalized effort to root out heresy and strengthen the hold of the Catholic Church and its allies, made it well known that those who did not fully comply with its wishes would suffer unspeakable punishments, from torture to being burned alive. Many militant movements throughout history have managed to erase from their followers an essential element of their humanity -- a part that we think could never be destroyed inside us. We cannot imagine deliberately inflicting pain on another, particularly someone who has not harmed us. But it turns out that our restraints against cruelty can be destroyed. History is replete with examples: The millions killed by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, as they sought to build a communist utopia. The industrialized killing factories built by Germany during World War II, which had no military value. However, they played the key role within Nazi ideology of exterminating unwanted people, principally Jews, but also the disabled, homosexuals, Roma (Gypsies) and other ""inferior"" peoples. The genocide in Rwanda, in which ethnic hatred unleashed a genocidal wave that left 800,000 dead, most hacked with machetes by their neighbors. Other jihadi groups operating today have shown no compunction about killing civilians, women and children, about kidnapping girls in Nigeria, about blowing up city markets in Baghdad, buses in London, restaurants, cafes and hotels in Bali, Jerusalem or Amman. The common denominator throughout history until today is an ideology that justifies everything for the search of a ""higher"" goal, one usually suffused with some utopian vision of a perfect world. It is a world that has no room for anyone who disagrees with those seeking to make it a reality and finds in cruelty a recruiting tool for the cause and a fully justified method in pursuit of ultimate success. Along the way, it turns men who were once presumably normal, even lovable, children into black-hooded executioners capable of taking a knife to the neck of a man kneeling at their feet, or of setting on fire another human being, a Muslim man, no less.","ISIS video alleges to show Jordanian pilot being burned alive .

"During a trip to the mostly Muslim nation of Albania, Pope Francis rebuked militants who act in the name of religion, saying no one can act as the ""armor of God."" The Pope lauded Albanians during a visit to the capital of Tirana, calling the Balkan nation one that proves ""a peaceful and fruitful coexistence between persons and communities of believers of different religions is not only desirable, but possible and realistic."" The pontiff didn't refer to any militant group by name. He denounced those who have perverted religious spirit and who are engaged in violence that prevents harmony between people of different faiths. Last month, he denounced ISIS, the Islamist militant group seeking to establish a caliphate in the Middle East. He called ISIS an ""unjust aggressor"" On Sunday, he again spoke harshly against religious warriors. ""Let no one consider themselves to be the 'armor' of God while planning and carrying out acts of violence and oppression,"" Pope Francis told diplomats at the presidential palace. ""May no one use religion as a pretext for actions against human dignity and against the fundamental rights of every man and woman, above all, the right to life and the right of everyone to religious freedom."" The pontiff pointed to the religious peace in Albania, a country relatively new to the concept of religious freedom. The population is 56% Muslim, 10% Catholic and 7% Orthodox, according to the CIA Factbook. The climate of respect and trust between those groups is a ""precious gift,"" the pontiff said. It has been two decades since a Pope last visited Albania, which is a short distance from Italy, just across the Adriatic Sea. The day-long visit is the first for Francis to another European country since he became Pope. On his way to the palace, he rode through the streets past multitudes of cheering fans and onlookers in an open Pope mobile. Later the Pope celebrated Mass on Mother Teresa Square. Many see Pope Francis' visit as support for the country's efforts to grow closer to the West and its wish to join the European Union. Albania was a Soviet satellite state before the fall of European communism at the end of the Cold War. It has been a democratic republic for 24 years.","No one can act as the ""armor of God,"" Pope Francis says .

"With one vote on Friday, the Republican-led House launched the latest spending battle in Congress -- one that could bring a government shutdown in less than two weeks. By a 230-189 tally almost strictly on party lines, the House passed a short-term government spending plan that would eliminate all funding for Obamacare. The measure now goes to the Democratic-led Senate, which is certain to reject the provision that defunds President Barack Obama's signature legislative achievement of his first term. Even though House Republicans now have voted 42 times to repeal or otherwise undermine Obamacare, Speaker John Boehner and fellow Republicans held a brief victory rally after Friday's action and challenged the Senate to follow their lead. ""The American people don't want the government shut down, and they don't want Obamacare,"" the Ohio Republican said to applause and cheers. ""The House has listened to the American people. Now it's time for the United States Senate to listen to them as well."" In a display of the raw politics of the battle, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia called out  Senate Democrats facing re-election next year by name, asking how Sens. Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Mark Begich of Alaska and Kay Hagan of North Carolina will vote on the House proposal. ""It's up to Senate Democrats to follow House Republicans and show some responsibility,"" Cantor said. Later Friday, Obama accused conservative Republicans of holding the nation hostage by trying to make passing a federal budget and increasing the debt ceiling contingent on defunding health care reforms. ""You don't have to threaten to blow the whole thing up if you don't get your way,"" Obama said in a campaign-style speech at a Ford plant in the Kansas City, Missouri area, adding that legislators in Washington were focused on politics and ""trying to mess with me,"" rather than helping the middle class. In legislative jargon, the House passed a continuing resolution that would keep the government funded for the first 11 weeks of the fiscal year that begins October 1. Without some kind of spending measure by then, parts of the government would have to curtail services or shut down. Government shutdown: Again? Seriously? Conservatives tie Obamacare to budget talks . The controversy involves the provision demanded by the GOP's conservative wing and agreed to by Boehner that eliminates all funding for the 2010 health care reforms popularly known as Obamacare. Approval by the House set in motion a Capitol Hill showdown that will continue through October, when the nation's debt ceiling must be increased so the government can pay all its bills. The two-stage process includes the possible government shutdown at the end of the current fiscal year on September 30 if there is no compromise on a spending resolution, followed by a potentially even more rancorous debate over raising the debt ceiling. Cantor said Friday the House would consider a one-year debt ceiling measure next week that contains other conservative-backed proposals, expected to include postponing implementation of Obamacare for a year and approving the Keystone oil pipeline from Canada. Obama, however, rejected playing politics with the debt ceiling, which is the limit for how much the federal government can borrow to pay bills it owes. ""This is not a deadbeat nation. We don't run out on our tab,"" the president said, calling even the threat of not raising the debt ceiling ""the height of irresponsibility."" He also made a point of telling the auto workers that raising the debt ceiling ""doesn't cost a dime"" and ""does not add a penny to our deficits."" ""All it says is, you gotta pay for what Congress already said we're spending money on,"" Obama said, adding that ""if you don't do it, we could have another financial crisis."" Tea party conservatives who have pledged to fight implementation of Obamacare consider the current budget debate their last major chance to undermine it, because the brunt of the new system takes effect with the start of fiscal year 2014 on October 1. They demand a halt to funding all programs from the 2010 Affordable Care Act, and they seem indifferent about forcing a government shutdown if that doesn't happen. ""I will do everything necessary and anything possible to defund Obamacare,"" Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said Thursday, threatening a filibuster and ""any procedural means necessary."" However, more moderate Republicans in the Democratic-led Senate call the defunding effort a waste of time. Veteran GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona told CNN on Thursday that because of the chamber's Democratic majority, ""we will not repeal or defund Obamacare"" in the Senate ""and to think we can is not rational."" In addition, the White House said Thursday that Obama would veto the House spending resolution defunding Obamacare if it reaches his desk. An earlier compromise proposed by Boehner and fellow GOP House leaders to their conservative wing would have allowed a symbolic vote on the defunding provision that the Senate would then strip out. The result would have been what legislators call a ""clean"" final version that simply extended current levels of government spending for about two months of the new fiscal year, allowing time for further negotiations on the debt ceiling. Worries about Obamacare? Fear not . However, conservative opposition to the compromise made Boehner agree to a tougher version that made overall government funding contingent on eliminating money for Obamacare. Moderate Republicans question the strategy, but fear a right-wing backlash in the 2014 primaries if they go against the conservative wing. In reference to the divisions in the House, McCain said it is ""pretty obvious that (Boehner) has great difficulties within his own conference."" On the House floor on Friday, legislators warned of the serious consequences of a government shutdown. The last shutdown, which occurred during the Clinton administration more than 17 years ago, comprised a total of 28 days and cost the nation more than $1 billion, according to congressional researchers. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California said the intent of the Republican measure is to shut down the government, calling it a ""wolf in wolf's clothing."" GOP Rep. Harold Rogers of Kentucky, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, said ""a government shutdown is a political game in which everyone loses."" ""It shirks one of our most basic duties as members of Congress and it puts our national security at stake,"" he added. Opinion: The real problem with Obamacare . Republicans said the House vote showed bipartisan support for defunding Obamacare because two Democrats backed the GOP resolution -- Reps. Jim Matheson of Utah and Mike McIntyre of North Carolina. Meanwhile, Rep. Scott Rigell of Virginia was the lone Republican to break ranks with his caucus by voting against it. In the Senate, Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada made clear on Thursday that any plan to defund Obamacare would be dead on arrival. Instead, the Senate is expected to strip the measure of all provisions defunding Obamacare and send it back to the House. ""They're simply postponing an inevitable choice they must face,"" Reid said of House Republicans. Boehner would then have to decide whether to put it to a vote, even though that could undermine his already weakened leadership position by having the measure pass with only a few dozen moderate Republicans joining Democrats in support. If he refuses to bring the Senate version to the floor for a vote, a shutdown would ensue. ""Will he act as the captain of the entire House of Representatives or remain a captive of his right wing Republican mates?"" asked Democratic Rep. Sander Levin of Michigan. ""Will he, as he acts, worry mainly about the risk to his speakership or the risk to our entire nation? House Republicans taking the ship over the cliff would take the nation's economic well-being with it."" Polls showing a decrease in public support for the health care reforms embolden the Republican stance. Meanwhile, Democratic resolve is bolstered by surveys showing most people oppose a government shutdown and more would blame Republicans if it happens. House GOP: defund Obamacare or shut government down . Shutdown scenario . Voices across the political spectrum warn against a shutdown, including Congressional Budget Office Director Douglas Elmendorf, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and Republican strategist Karl Rove. ""Even the defund strategy's authors say they don't want a government shutdown. But their approach means we'll get one,"" Rove argued in an op-ed published Thursday by the Wall Street Journal.","President Obama says conservative Republicans holding the country hostage .

"(The Hollywood Reporter)It's been nearly six months since Robin Williams' death, and in the last two, the late comedian's family have entered into a dispute over the personal property his trust assigns each of them. On one side is his widow, Susan Williams, who filed a petition in December for a court's interpretation of the trust. On the other are his three children by previous marriages, Zachary, Zelda and Cody, who dispute the reading she provides. The dispute centers on the two houses Williams owned at the time of his death — one in Napa and one in Tiburon, California. Susan's filing calls the Tiburon house the ""marital abode,"" and the trust, which her late husband most recently amended in 2010, before their marriage in 2011, grants her the Tiburon residence and its contents upon his death. That's where things get complicated. Williams' widow claims that ""within days"" of his death in August, the trustees started gathering up the comedian's property. Within weeks they allegedly informed her they would come to the Tiburon residence to remove more of it. ""The co-Trustees had keys to her home. Naturally, Mrs. Williams became frightened of the co-Trustees invading her home,"" reads her petition, filed in San Francisco Superior Court. In their opposition, filed in the same court on January 21, Williams' children tell it differently. They claim that collecting and inventorying Williams' property is part of the execution of the trust. Furthermore, they say she held them off for nearly three months ""while at the same time permitting various third parties to access the residence on her own behalf to appraise certain Trust assets, remove certain Trust assets from the Tiburon Residence, and plan, design and implement a $30,000 renovation."" Read more: THR's 10 Most Popular Stories of 2014 . She complains of not being ""given time to grieve her loss free from the frenetic efforts to interfere with her domestic tranquility"" or that of her high-school-aged sons. But her resistance to the trustees' efforts was in part due to concerns over the interpretation of the trust. Specifically, there's one paragraph about certain items of Williams' property that his beneficiaries have made into a tricky semantics debate. The paragraph assigns to Williams' children all of his ""clothing, jewelry, personal photos taken prior to his marriage to (Susan) ... memorabilia and awards in the entertainment industry and the tangible personal property located in Napa."" In Susan's interpretation, the paragraph is ambiguous regarding the house (or houses) from which the items can be removed. Is the phrase ""located in Napa"" in reference only to ""tangible personal property,"" or is it restrictive of every category? She claims her husband wished ""to allow her to stay in their Tiburon home as it was during their marriage,"" and therefore the paragraph should be read to cover only the items in the Napa house, not those in the Tiburon house. ""Any other interpretation would lead to Mrs. Williams's home being stripped while Mrs. Williams still lives there,"" her filing reads. It would give the trustees permission to give to the children items including the tuxedo he wore at their wedding, she specifies. ""It is difficult to imagine Mr. Williams desiring that outcome."" But Williams' kids read the trust differently — they argue that it grants them every category of item listed in addition to the property in the Napa house, not every category of item confined to the Napa house. It's nonsensical to list ""the tangible personal property located in Napa"" separately if there aren't items to which they're entitled outside the Napa house, they argue. They point out lines in the trust that give Susan the Tiburon house and its contents with the exceptions of items gifted in other stipulations. They want the court to declare they're entitled to the categories' items in the Tiburon house, too. ""The Williams Children are heartbroken that Petitioner, Williams' wife of less than three years, has acted against his wishes by challenging the plans he so carefully made for his estate,"" reads their opposition. ""While it is styled as a request for instruction, the Petition in fact appears to be a blatant attempt to alter the disposition of assets Mr. Williams specifically planned and provided for."" ""We're puzzled a little by the tone of the opposition,"" Susan Williams' attorney, James Wagstaffe, tells The Hollywood Reporter. ""I'm hopeful that there's a spirit of generosity in this."" Read more: Robin Williams Had ""Early Stages of Parkinson's Disease,"" Wife Says . But Susan's petition anticipates their counterargument, and in the event a judge finds the paragraph applies to the Tiburon house, she wants categories like ""memorabilia"" and ""jewelry"" narrowly defined. The former should encompass only items depicting him or relating to his fame — ""in other words, this does not include his personal collections of knick-knacks"" — and the latter shouldn't include his watches, she argues. Williams's children dispute her interpretations, in particular criticizing her characterization of their father's collections — which apparently included Japanese anime figurines, antique weapons, carved boxes, theater masks, rare books, lapel pins, fossils, graphic novels and skulls — as ""knick-knacks."" They were ""carefully amassed"" during his lifetime and should go to his children, they argue. ""As the Williams Children grew, so did their father's collections and they shared in their father's excitement as additions were made to his collections,"" their filing reads. There's one separate question, too. It's unclear whether the contents of storage spaces Susan claims were intended for the Tiburon home should go to her as if they were contents of the house itself. California courts have never addressed the issue, according to Susan's filing. ""In other states that have considered this issue, courts have found that a residence, i.e. a home should be broadly interpreted,"" her filing continues. The Williams children, unsurprisingly, present different case law that indicates a home should be strictly understood to mean the physical location. A hearing is scheduled for March 30 in Superior Court in Marin County, where Tiburon is located, but Wagstaffe tells THR he hopes the parties will sort it out in discussions before then. Attorneys for the Williams children have not responded to a request for comment.

"Tobey Maguire has settled a lawsuit that sought repayment of hundreds of thousands of dollars the ""Spider-Man"" actor allegedly won in secret high-stakes poker games at Beverly Hills luxury hotels, according to court documents filed last week. A series of federal suits, including the one against Maguire, said the poker winnings were paid with funds stolen from investors who had been lured into an illegal Ponzi scheme. Maguire agreed to pay $80,000 to the estate of Bradley Ruderman, 48, who is serving a 10-year federal prison sentence for tax, wire and investor advice fraud convictions.  The judge will hold a hearing on December 21 to decide if he will approve the Maguire settlement. The lawsuit against Maguire, filed in March, alleged that the actor won $311,000 from Ruderman in 2007 and 2008. Actors Nick Cassavetes and Gabe Kaplan, along with professional poker player Dan Bilzerian, two nightclub owners and a Los Angeles lawyer, are among at least 10 other people sued by a bankruptcy trustee. Most of the celebrity defendants have not publicly commented on the case, but Kaplan, the star of the 1970s TV sitcom ""Welcome Back, Kotter,"" reached his own settlement in August. Kaplan, whose poker skills are well known because of his frequent television appearances at professional gambling events, agreed to repay $27,000 of the $62,000 the trustee contended he was paid in gambling proceeds from the Ponzi scheme funds. Lawsuits: Celebrities play high-stakes poker in hotels . None of the defendants in the civil lawsuits faced criminal charges, but the bankruptcy trustee for Ruderman's estate said they had to return at least $1.5 million of their alleged gambling winnings. What each defendant allegedly has in common is that they beat Bradley Ruderman in ""regularly held, high stakes and clandestine 'Texas Hold 'em' poker games"" at hotels and homes in the Beverly Hills area. Ruderman induced at least 22 victim-investors to give him approximately $44.3 million that was never invested, one lawsuit said. Ruderman, a Beverly Hills resident, used the money, in part, to cover his gambling losses, it said. The suits say that the poker games were ""exclusive events, by invitation only, and that there was a regular roster of players consisting of wealthy celebrities, entrepreneurs, attorneys and businessmen."" The games were also unlicensed and illegal, so ""the player had no legally enforceable contractual right to receive payment,"" the suits said. Bilzerian, a top professional poker player known as the ""Blitz,"" beat Ruderman for $100,000, which the bankruptcy trustee wants back, court documents said. There is no criminal investigation of the alleged gambling,  a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district attorney said in June when the lawsuits were made public.  ""Gambling is illegal, but it's a misdemeanor,"" Sandi Gibbons said. The court documents pull back the curtain a bit on what is mostly done behind closed doors by the wealthy and well-known in Beverly Hills. The poker games were ""held at luxury locations such as The Four Seasons Hotel in Los Angeles, California, the Beverly Hills Hotel in Beverly Hills, California, the Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills, California, and occasionally at private residences of the poker players,"" the lawsuits said. None of the hotels would comment on the allegations when contacted by CNN. The games were ""arranged by Molly Bloom, initially (as) an assistant to one of the poker players and then as a stand-alone business,"" court documents said. Bloom arranged ""food, alcohol and massages"" for the players and ""arranged for the settlement of gambling winnings and losses between and among the players."" Bloom, who is being sued by the trustee for $473,200, denied in a response to the court that she was involved in organized illegal gambling. She acknowledged, however, that she ""performed services and received value from Ruderman in good faith in exchange for her services."" Bloom passed ""a large percentage"" of the money sent to her by Ruderman to ""third parties,"" her response said. Ruderman's Ponzi scheme spanned seven years, starting in 2002 and ending with an FBI investigation in 2009, according to court papers. ""To obtain investments in the fund, Ruderman misrepresented to potential investors that Lowell Milken (chairman of the Milken Family Foundation and younger brother of Michael Milken) and Larry Ellison (the CEO of Oracle Corporation) were investors in the funds,"" federal court documents said. Ruderman provided false accounting statements claiming his hedge fund investments earned between 15% and 61% each year and were valued at more than $800 million, the documents said. ""In reality, the funds lost millions of dollars over the years and had a net liquidation value of less than $650,000 at the end of 2008,"" documents said. It was a year after the funds collapse in April 2009, and months after Ruderman pleaded guilty in January 2010, that the bankruptcy trustee discovered the large transfers of cash from the fund to pay his gambling debts, the lawsuits said.","The ""Spider-Man"" actor agrees to pay $80,000 to settle the $311,000 claim .

"(CNN) -- It's the dark days that Oliver Wilson remembers most. The phone calls with his psychologist where the tears flowed, the moment his wife Lauren sat him down and told him he could give up the game of golf, that he had nothing left to prove. He boasted an unenviable place in the record books: the most runner-up spots in European Tour history without a win, having finished second nine times in 227 tournament starts. And then there was the accolade of being the only Ryder Cup representative -- he played for Europe at Valhalla in 2008 -- not to have won a title. However, in a career of unlucky numbers, the Englishman will forever remember 228 -- which marked his long-awaited breakthrough victory and the lifting of a cloud of depression that threatened to end his playing days. It came this month at St. Andrews, as the 34-year-old held off the world's best player, Rory McIlroy, to win the prestigious Alfred Dunhill Links Championship and rocket 636 places up the world rankings from 792nd. As he walked down the 18th fairway at the home of golf, running through his mind was the thought that he would soon be hearing from the legendary Gary Player, a nine-time major winner with a propensity to tweet each weekend's big tournament winner. For the first time in Wilson's life, he was the social media recipient. He calls it a ""Cinderella story"" and it is just that. Things started to go horribly wrong when he missed qualifying for the 2012 European Tour by a single shot in Wales. He returned to the locker room and burst into tears. ""There were some very dark times,"" he says on reflection. ""Last year was very rough on us (Wilson and his wife). It was hard, very stressful at home."" Wilson was shelling out money just to play golf. He estimates that, prior to St. Andrews, he had spent about $120,000 over two years merely traveling to tournaments -- and banked barely half of that before tax from a smattering of prize money. He is not looking for sympathy -- after all, he admits he is unlucky enough to have banked enough money from past results to be financially secure. ""I remember Lauren said to me, 'It's okay if you don't want to do it and don't enjoy it.' And I hated it. I didn't want to go and play,"" he says. ""I worked harder than ever before in practice and in the gym, and it only made it worse. In some ways being at events was easy. The pressure was off, I knew I'd turn up, play two rounds, not make the cut and go home."" Until St. Andrews, where in 2009 he tied for second with McIlroy at the same event, Wilson had not carded a single round under par in two months. Perhaps a tad ironic for a golfer who had hit rock bottom, it was fellow European Tour professional Robert Rock that came to his aid. Rock sent a lengthy email missive detailing his compatriot's swing, likening it to that of McIlroy and Tiger Woods, and highlighting where he had gone wrong with it. With the new tips on board, Wilson put them into practice the following day and immediately broke the course record, albeit at a second-tier European Challenge Tour event in Kazakhstan. ""I thought, 'We could be on to something here.' I owe it all to him,"" Wilson says. He was not able to follow up his success at last weekend's rain-shortened Portugal Masters, where only two rounds were possible, but he has had time to reflect on the $800,000 pay check -- which took him past $8 million in career prize money -- and what it means for him. For one thing, he has secured his place on the European Tour for the next two years, and entry into two World Golf Championship events. Wilson had always said his aspiration was to buy an Aston Martin when he won a tournament. Now it has happened, he does not intend to be so frivolous. For him, the money is not the key thing. ""I'd always dreamed of winning at St. Andrews -- the (British) Open or the Dunhill Links Championships -- but this time it happened."" It will go down as one of the most popular victories of the season, all and sundry tweeting and texting to pass on their congratulations to one of the sporting feelgood stories of 2014. McIlroy -- the man he pipped to the title -- was among those to congratulate Wilson, as well as European Ryder Cup star Ian Poulter, who tweeted: ""I can't tell you how happy every player on Tour will be for Oliver Wilson winning the Dunhill Links. It's been a long road back."" Aptly, the tournament ended in him driving away from St. Andrews in a Skoda while the world's golfing elite took off in their private jets. But now he says he feels he can ""take on the world"" -- a far cry to the past two seasons when he needed a psychologist to ""keep me going while I was breaking down over the phone. I didn't know what to do."" That he was at St. Andrews at all was somewhat fortuitous -- Wilson needed a late invite from the organizers. ""I was nervous on the Saturday but not on the Sunday until the final two holes,"" he recalls. ""The big thing was making a four on the 17th, I'd avoided the big danger. I remember hitting the three wood on the 18th and I just didn't have any feeling of how it was, like you normally would. ""It was the same with the approach, there was just no feedback -- it was bizarre. I thought I was set for another playoff (he has lost all four he has been in) but Tommy Fleetwood's putt slid just wide and that was it. I was in bits."" Unbeknown to him, his wife had traveled to Scotland to watch his final round, and Wilson only spotted her as he left the final green. ""I'm glad I didn't know she was there until then,"" he says. ""I remember I was looking at the ground as I was crying but then I looked up and she appeared. That was amazing, to know she'd had that belief in me to come up there. ""I think a lot of people think golfing wives are trophy wives but we're a team and she's been through it all. She's been a massive influence."" Wilson's golfing roller coaster is finally back on the upswing. At his previous peak six years ago he was a member of the last European team to lose the Ryder Cup, but he did not foresee how his fortunes would plummet. ""I felt incredible, like anything could happen,"" he says of that time. ""I saw other players struggle and I thought, 'That won't happen to me.' "" But then it did and he feared he would never get his game back. However, he is now targeting a place in the European Tour's top 30 and the hope of playing at his first major tournament since 2010. After all, next year the British Open will be held at his new lucky course -- St. Andrews.","Oliver Wilson wins his first European Tour tournament at the 228th attempt .

"DORCHESTER, Massachusetts (CNN)  -- Friends, family and colleagues paid tribute to Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy on Friday evening with a three-hour wake capped by a chorus of ""When Irish Eyes Are Smiling."" Joseph P. Kennedy II recalls how his ""Uncle Teddy"" looked after the family. An estimated 45,000 people filed past the Democratic legend's flag-draped casket at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library before the event. Connecticut Sen. Christopher Dodd, who has tried to shepherd Kennedy's signature cause of universal health care through the Senate this year, summed up his appeal in three words: ""People liked him."" ""Some people born with a famous name live off of it. Others enrich theirs,"" Dodd said. ""Teddy enriched his."" Kennedy died Tuesday night at age 77 after being ill with brain cancer for 15 months. He had represented Massachusetts in the Senate since 1962, leaving his stamp on ""nearly every important law passed in the last half-century,"" Dodd said. He became the patriarch of the first family of Democratic politics after the assassinations of his brothers, President John F. Kennedy and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, during the 1960s. One of Robert Kennedy's sons, former Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II, fondly recounted how ""Uncle Teddy"" looked after the children of his slain siblings.  Watch Vice President Biden explain how Kennedy ""crept into my heart"" » . ""The truth of the matter is that for so many of us, we just needed someone to hang on to, and Teddy was always there to hang on to,"" he said. ""He had such a big heart, and he shared that heart with all of us."" The wake was held at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in suburban Boston, a building ""that Teddy built and brought to life with his dedication to public service,"" said the slain president's daughter, Caroline. Kennedy's own presidential aspirations were hobbled by the controversy around a 1969 auto accident that left a young woman dead and a 1980 primary challenge to then-President Jimmy Carter that ended in defeat. But while the White House eluded his grasp, he played major roles in passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act and the 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act. ""He constantly renewed my faith and optimism in the possible,"" Vice President Joe Biden said at the memorial. ""I never once saw your father with a defeatist attitude, I never saw him petty. I never saw him act in a small way, and as a consequence he made us all bigger -- both his friends, his allies and his foes."" Kennedy was an outspoken liberal standard-bearer during a conservative-dominated era from the 1980s to the early 2000s. He died as President Obama, whom Kennedy boosted in the 2008 presidential campaign, is pushing for a wide-ranging overhaul of the U.S. health insurance system, a fight the dying senator called ""the cause of my life"" in a July issue of Newsweek. Kennedy was famous for his close friendships with colleagues across the Senate aisle even as his name was an anathema in Republican campaign materials. Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch said the Kennedy name was ""my very best fundraiser,"" but that he developed ""a strong working relationship with and love for the man I came to fight.""  Watch Hatch tell how he won a big favor from Kennedy » . ""If you would have told me that he would become one of my closest friends in the world I probably would have suggested that you need professional help,"" Hatch said. A visibly emotional Hatch said he last saw Kennedy ""a couple of months ago,"" and the two had their picture taken together. ""That means so much to me,"" Hatch said. ""I had to say it was a wonderful occasion, and I miss fighting in public and joking with him in the background. I miss all the things we knew we could do together."" Arizona Sen. John McCain, the GOP's 2008 presidential candidate, said Kennedy ""taught me to be a better senator."" ""He was the most reliable, the most prepared and the most persistent member of the Senate,"" McCain said. ""He took the long view, and he never gave up."" McCain added, ""I think most of my colleagues would agree the place won't be the same without him."" The senator's funeral is scheduled for Saturday at Boston's Our Lady of Perpetual Help Basilica in Boston's Mission Hill section, with at least 40 of Kennedy's fellow senators and former presidents Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush slated to attend. Obama, who called Kennedy an ""extraordinary leader"" on Wednesday, will deliver a eulogy at the funeral, according to several sources. Prime Minister Brian Cowen of Ireland, the famous clan's ancestral homeland, and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown are also expected to attend, a family spokesman said. Kennedy will be buried Saturday evening at Arlington National Cemetery, outside Washington, 95 feet south of the grave of Sen. Robert Kennedy, which is in turn just steps away from John Kennedy's burial site.","Joseph Kennedy: ""He had such a big heart, and he shared that heart with all of us""

"A black man is returning to the White House. Four years ago, it was a first, the breaking of a racial barrier. Tuesday night, it was history redux. And more. In the midst of national splintering and a time of deep ideological animosity, Americans elected President Barack Obama to a second term. And thousands rejoiced in his victory, one that seemed sweeter and, perhaps, more significant. ""This is affirmation that his color doesn't matter and that his message resonated with people,"" said Yale University sociologist Jeffrey Alexander, author of ""Obama's Victory and the Democratic Struggle for Power."" ""It is very important in that it will indicate that an African-American can be viewed for what he says and not what he is."" Victorious Obama faces familiar challenges . Had Obama lost the election, he would likely have been remembered in history as the first black president, and maybe little else, Alexander said. Now, he has a chance to create a legacy rooted not in his identity, but in his ideas. University of Houston sociologist Shayne Lee agreed. ""If this country wants President Obama to have another term, I'm ready to say that it's a significant moment,"" he said. As an African-American, Lee understood the power of 2008. But his excitement was measured. He knew the nation was tired then of two costly wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, a sinking economy and an administration that he felt excluded ordinary people. He thought Arizona Sen. John McCain was a weak candidate and that the cards were stacked in Obama's favor. Four years later, Obama traversed a much tougher road, Lee said. Americans had a strong alternative in the Republican challenger, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. The nation, he felt, was no longer in a desperate state and voters had more of a choice. Despite that, they elected a black man. Again. ""They sent a message to the world that whatever racist proclivities might exist are not enough to preclude Obama from winning,"" Lee said. ""We cannot deny that this is new social space we occupy in this country."" A changing America, Lee believes, will be very much a part of Obama's national conversation in a second term. That includes a stronger stance on race relations, an issue some believe Obama had to distance himself from in his first term for political expediency. For that, he drew criticism from African-Americans with high expectations of a black president. ""Can you imagine knowing you're the first black president and you have to win the Midwest to win a second term?"" he said. ""It's such a thin thread that holds together his ability to win as a black candidate. ""The constraints are not going to be there in his second term. He's going to have much more swagger."" In playwright and New York radio show host Esther Armah's estimation, Obama's re-election feels more historic than his first because of what she views as a tide of callousness toward people of color. She criticized measures like the new voter ID laws in several states, which she said obstruct participation and ""desecrated"" American democracy. She said re-electing Obama represented a denunciation of those measures and the Republican presidential candidate who supported them. ""It's really important to recognize that this was not just a choice to put someone back into the White House,"" Armah said, ""but a choice to reject a man who demonstrated callousness."" ""I have exhaled. I am breathing,"" she said. Americans demand more from Obama's second term . Obama's victory, said CNN contributor Van Jones, was possible because of the support of a coalition of people who reflect America's demographics. ""Nobody believed four years ago that you could have black folks and lesbians and gays and Latinos and young folk standing together to move the country forward,"" said Jones, a former special adviser to Obama. But Obama was demonized, he said, and turned into a cartoon character. African-Americans asked if someone like Obama is not acceptable, then who is? ""There is vindication here,"" Jones said. ""This is a backlash against the backlash. You saw African-Americans stepping up, Latinos stepping up, young people stepping up ... saying we're better than we've been seeing on the attacks on this president."" Opinion: Five things Obama must do . The challenge for Obama in the next four years, however, will no longer be racial in nature, Alexander said. It is certain to be ideological. Obama won't ever have to run for office again, but he will have to make his case for policies, Alexander said. ""His goal has been to be a post-polarization candidate, and he naively believed he could do that as a president,"" he said. ""He didn't want to be a highly partisan figure. As a result, he couldn't control the political debate. He's going to have to keep campaigning and not become a policy wonk."" Obama seemed to recognize that in his victory speech early Wednesday in Chicago, the city where he first fostered hopes and launched dreams. He told the roaring crowd, made up of that previously improbable coalition, that he planned to sit down with Mitt Romney in the weeks ahead to chart a new course for the country. Opinion: Obama will get little time to celebrate . ""We believe in a tolerant America, open to the dreams of an immigrant's daughter who pledges to our flag, to the young boy on the south side of Chicago who sees a life beyond the street corner, to the furniture worker's child in North Carolina who wants to become a doctor or a diplomat or even a president,"" Obama said. ""We will rise and fall as one nation, and as one people. It doesn't matter if you are black or white, young or old, rich or poor. You can make it in America, if you're willing to try."" It was a reflection of his own journey, of a man who'd made it as a two-term black president.","In the midst of national splintering, voters returned a black man to the White House .
Sociologists say this is affirmation that Obama's ideas mattered more than his identity .
He will have a chance now to leave a legacy beyond being the first black president .
He will take a stronger stance on race issues in his second term, some say ."
"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Wednesday praised the recent purge of his uncle and former protector, saying it brought greater unity within the secretive, nuclear-armed state. ""In the seething period of the effort for building a thriving country last year, we took the resolute measure of removing the factionalists lurking in the Party,"" Kim said in a New Year's address, referring to the North's ruling Workers' Party of Korea. ""As our Party detected and purged the anti-Party, counterrevolutionary factionalists at an opportune time and with a correct decision, the Party and revolutionary ranks were further consolidated and our single-hearted unity was solidified to the maximum,"" Kim said, according to the text of the speech carried by North Korean state media. The purged uncle, Jang Song Thaek, was considered instrumental in Kim's rise to power in December 2011 and, until recently, was regarded as the second-most powerful figure in North Korea. But the young leader turned his back on Jang in spectacular fashion late last year, having him executed last month on charges he tried to overthrow the government. A publicized purge . The death of Jang, who was married to Kim's paternal aunt, was announced in an unusually public declaration by the reclusive regime. Purges and executions of senior officials are believed to have taken place under the North's previous leaders, Kim's father and grandfather, but without such public fanfare. North Korean state media attacked Jang's character and detailed an extensive list of his alleged crimes, describing him as ""despicable human scum."" Kim's speech Wednesday is the first time he has publicly commented on the purge. A range of different theories have been put forward for the real causes behind Jang's downfall. Last week, South Korea's main intelligence agency told lawmakers that it believed business disputes inside the North Korean regime had precipitated the purge. Nuclear warning . In his speech, Kim also addressed his country's strained relationship with South Korea and the United States, warning that if war were to break out in the region, it would spiral into a nuclear confrontation. ""The U.S. and South Korean war maniacs have deployed legions of equipment for a nuclear war in and around the Korean Peninsula and are going frantic in their military exercises for a nuclear war against the North,"" Kim said. ""This precipitates a critical situation where any accidental military skirmish may lead to an all-out war."" ""Should another war break out on this land,"" he said, ""it will result in a deadly nuclear catastrophe and the United States will never be safe."" But his words stopped well short of the alarmingly threatening language that peppered North Korean statements in early 2013 as tensions spiked over the regime's nuclear test in February and the resulting U.N. sanctions. North and South . Kim called for better ties between the two Koreas, which have reestablished dialogue and reopened their shared industrial complex since the rocky period in the spring. ""A favorable climate should be established for improved relations between the North and the South,"" he said. In South Korea, President Park Geun-hye said that her government would strive to maintain ""impregnable"" security and prepare for any possible provocations by the North. Analysts have said that the purge of Jang could be a sign of instability inside North Korea and that Kim could seek to focus attention away from domestic issues by carrying out a provocative act, like another new rocket or nuclear test. Park said the South Korean government would ""redouble its efforts to further promote peace on the Korean Peninsula and lay the groundwork for peaceful reunification.""

"(CNN)They're a relatively small group of parents in a big country. But their decision not to vaccinate their children can have a profound impact on public health. Opponents of vaccines against diseases like measles are simply on the ""wrong side,"" CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta says. Just how many people are we talking about, and what do we know about them as a group? Here's a look at some key numbers. According to the CDC, in the United States: . • 95% of children in kindergarten have had vaccines for preventable diseases, including two doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. But that figure is not spread evenly across the country. • 82% of children in Colorado have had the two-dose MMR vaccine that doctors say is necessary. In Mississippi, virtually all children in kindergarten (99.7%) are vaccinated. • 26 states have not reported meeting a government target of 95% coverage for MMR. The differences stem from varying laws over when exemptions are allowed. The National Conference of State Legislatures reports: . • 48 states and the District of Columbia allow religious exemptions from vaccines . • 20 states allow philosophical exemptions. Even within states that have high exemption rates, ""vaccination exemptions have been shown to cluster geographically, so vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks can still occur where unvaccinated persons cluster in schools and communities,"" the CDC says. Because of health complications, some children should not be vaccinated, doctors say. These children are also one of the biggest reasons vaccination is so important. Those unvaccinated can carry the disease and infect vulnerable children. Families with medical exemptions make up a small portion of those who don't vaccinate. The CDC reports: . • In California, there were about 1,000 medical exemptions in the 2013-2014 school year, and more than 17,000 philosophical exemptions. • Florida had less than 800 medical exemptions and about 4,000 religious exemptions. Florida does not allow philosophical exemptions. • Mississippi and West Virginia do not allow religious or philosophical exemptions, and they reported only about 50 medical exemptions combined. (See a full state-by-state breakdown here.) Why do some parents opt out?  They're more likely to have vaccine safety concerns and to ""perceive fewer benefits associated with vaccines,"" a study found -- despite the scientific evidence and debunking of a study that suggested vaccines could trigger autism. Most of these parents do believe vaccines are necessary to protect the health of their children. But many also believe their children could suffer from the vaccines themselves. The study was published by Public Health Reports, the official journal of the U.S. Public Health Service, in 2011. It found that among parents who delay and refuse vaccines: . • 70% say they believe the vaccines are necessary to protect the health of their children (compared with 96% of parents who vaccinate) • 63% say they fear their children could have serious side effects (compared with 31% of parents who vaccinate). • 57% say they have concerns about autism. • 78% say they believe children get too many shots. • There's also more mistrust of the medical community among those who don't vaccinate. While 95% of parents who vaccinate said medical professionals in charge of vaccinations have their children's best interest at heart, 77% of parents who delayed and refused vaccines agreed. The Public Health Reports study also found that families of unvaccinated kids are more likely to be: . • Wealthier on average, with annual incomes more than four times the poverty level . • Non-Hispanic white . • Married couples in English-speaking households . • Educated, with college degrees, and . • Covered by private health insurance. In the medical community, conversations are underway about how to reach out to these parents. ""There's not much we can do about the small core of people who oppose vaccines based on ideology,"" Ford Vox, a brain injury doctor in Atlanta, wrote in a CNN column. ""... But we have a better shot with the larger and more rational border zone of the vaccine hesitant who may base their concerns on genuine cases of vaccine harm, such as the very small but accepted link between influenza vaccination and a temporary paralysis called Guillain-Barré Syndrome."" Cultivating ""a strong patient-doctor relationship is the most successful method of reversing vaccine opposition,"" he wrote. That means carving out a system in which ""your doctor is granted the time to truly understand you, while at the same time allowing your doctor to treat you appropriately. ... If we've done our job right, you'll seek out the insights we've earned from treating many challenging cases over many years. And we'll know we've succeeded in our new relationship when you let us vaccinate your children."" What is your message to those who don't vaccinate?","26 states have not reached a federal target for vaccination .
Mississippi has the highest level of vaccination; Colorado has the lowest .
Many parents of unvaccinated children are concerned about side effects, autism and children having too many shots ."
"Canada and tennis? Really? Yes the country known in sporting terms for dominating ice hockey and curling is prospering in a summer sport. And at least among the men, Canada is trumping the U.S., its more heralded and populous neighbor. Early last year, Milos Raonic achieved a significant milestone when he became the first non-U.S. male to assume the position of North American No. 1 since rankings began in 1973. ""Didn't expect that one to happen,"" John McEnroe, the controversial, charismatic and talented former No. 1, said in a conference call. ""I guess I learned to expect the unexpected."" While Raonic's feat said much about the amply discussed state of the U.S. men -- from having 42 players in the top 100 this week in 1984, only six found themselves there at the start of this week's U.S. Open -- it was the beginning of an unprecedented boom in Canadian tennis thanks to the 23-year-old, Eugenie Bouchard and Vasek Pospisil. Boom in singles, that is. Daniel Nestor is one of the greatest doubles players of all time and continues to collect titles at the age of nearly 42. Raonic, still the continent's top male player and ranked sixth overall, is frequently mentioned in the same breath as Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov when it comes to players able to threaten the ""Big Four"" of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray and potentially claim a grand slam title. He has bettered that illustrious quartet in one area this year, despite suffering from a lower leg injury in January and February. Raonic is the lone player to reach at least the quarterfinals in six Masters events. ""It's been great,"" Raonic told CNN. ""I've put myself in weekend parts of tournaments, in the quarters or better most of the time so I've given myself a shot against the top guys."" No wonder he has high hopes at the year's final grand slam. ""I believe I can win the tournament, so that's what I'm pushing to do,"" Raonic said. He is already the highest-ranked Canadian man in history, easily surpassing Canadian-turned-Brit Greg Rusedski's No. 41 in 1994, and was the first man from his nation in more than a century to reach the semifinals at Wimbledon. With a serve considered one of the best in the game and a temperament as unwavering as his well-manicured hair, he should be around for a while, too. He emerged earlier than Bouchard, but the 20-year-old -- whose first language is English, despite the francophone sounding family name -- has turned into a media darling a la a trio of North American blondes of decades past, Chris Evert, Tracy Austin and the 1984 U.S. Open semifinalist from Canada, Carling Bassett. She even has her own fan club, the ""Genie Army."" Given the name Eugenie because of her mother's fascination with British royalty, destiny appeared to be on Bouchard's side when she made July's Wimbledon final -- she was the first player representing Canada to play in a grand slam singles final. But Petra Kvitova scuppered any hopes of a Hollywood ending with a masterful display of power tennis that left even the feisty Bouchard in tears. Yet, she has reached at least the semifinals of the year's first three majors, something 17-time grand slam champion Serena Williams and five-time grand slam champion Maria Sharapova -- Bouchard's idol -- didn't accomplish. Bouchard's loss of form entering the U.S. Open is likely a slight wobble instead of a longstanding concern. High expectations don't faze her. ""It's a position I want to be in,"" she told reporters on the eve of the New York event. Pospisil trumped Raonic and Bouchard in one department -- becoming a grand slam winner at the highest level. He and American partner Jack Sock triumphed in the men's doubles at Wimbledon. The baby-faced Pospisil, whose weapons are his serve and forehand, faced Raonic in the first all-Canadian final on the men's tour in Washington in early August. He broke into the top 30 this year in singles and, if not for a back injury, might have gone farther. ""It was tough because I was gathering so much momentum throughout 2013 and then I felt like I was playing great tennis at the start of this year,"" Pospisil told CNN before he lost his first-round match at the U.S. Open. ""Then I hit a bit of a wall there, a big speed bump."" The rapid success has surprised Davis Cup captain Martin Laurendeau, who achieved a career high of No. 90 in 1988. With Laurendeau at the helm, Canada surfaced in a maiden Davis Cup semifinal in 2013. ""We had a few athletes spread out during the generations doing a few good things here and there, but never really was there a club like this where they broke through on the international stage at the same time,"" Laurendeau told CNN. The inevitable question is, why now? ""Tennis Canada's development programs, especially in Montreal, have been excellent, but in many ways the best players -- Raonic in Toronto, Bouchard in Montreal and Pospisil in Vancouver -- owe the most to their families and individual coaches,"" Canada's longest serving tennis writer, Tom Tebbutt, told CNN. Touching more on Tennis Canada's contribution, Laurendeau brought up several factors. The focus, he said, has shifted to high performance and development. More resources, he added, have allowed the governing body to hire experienced coaches from other countries -- Laurendeau cited Louis Borfiga, who worked extensively in France -- and junior players can attend the tournaments they want rather simply choose the cheapest option. ""Louis came in and helped to change the mentality of the Canadian tennis players,"" said Laurendeau. ""I do believe we believe more in our capabilities to break through. ""The mentality is a big part of it, definitely."" To that end, Bouchard wasn't just happy to reach the Wimbledon final, and Raonic said Wimbledon was bittersweet. He took pride in getting to the last four but was ""upset"" with his straight-set loss to Federer. Thus instead of doing media rounds when he got back home, Raonic almost immediately went straight back to training. ""As soon as I got my time off, I actually left Canada,"" said Raonic. ""I wanted to be away from the things that might follow after tennis. ""When I came back and started training, I trained away from the tennis facility and actually (trained) where Toronto's (MLS) team trains. ""I think it was a great result in general at Wimbledon, but I was upset with the way it finished so I wanted to put that behind me and get my nose back into the work."" Now, according to Laurendeau, the key is to maintain the momentum. Having a major star or handful of pros thriving is no guarantee of sustained success. Take Sweden or Brazil. Sweden, the home of Bjorn Borg and Stefan Edberg, doesn't have a men's player in the top 200. Brazil, meanwhile, couldn't capitalize on Gustavo ""Guga"" Kuerten's enormous popularity. Helping Canada is its tennis infrastructure -- a major training hub lies in Montreal -- and more people in the country, according to information provided by Tennis Canada, are playing the sport. The performances of Raonic, Bouchard and Pospisil should maintain the trend for the foreseeable future. ""When things get hot but there's no structure behind it, well, there are so many options for kids to go into that are exciting,"" said Laurendeau. ""You want to pick up the game, you go here. How old are you? You can go here. Where do you live? You can go here. ""That's very important. When I look back at the Guga era, he was probably one of the greatest known sports figures in the world at one time. ""Especially in Brazil, tennis was very popular. Why didn't they see a boom behind Guga? It was because that was lacking. It's important for us to have a structure in place -- and we do have it in place.""","Canada's Milos Raonic is the top-ranked North American male on the tennis tour .

"(CNN)From the Plains to the Northeast, a second brutal winter storm in a week has left behind a deadly trail and record amounts of snow. You can see it in the aftermath:  Canceled classes, grounded flights and massive piles of snow along roadways. And we're only in early February. The Boston area has gotten the worst of it. Bean Town set a new record for snowiest seven-day period in the city's history with 40.2 inches, the National Weather Service reported.  Boston's average annual snowfall is 47 inches.  The city has already gotten more than that over the last two weeks. It's a similar story in Chicago where the latest storm dumped 19.3 inches of snow. The 16.2 inches recorded at O'Hare International Airport just Sunday were the most ever for any February day in the Windy City.  The city got as much snow Sunday as it had in all of January, Mayor Rahm Emanuel said. And to add insult to injury.  ""We don't have this much snow in Alaska right now,"" Chicago visitors Emma Marks and Daniel Dobbs told CNN affiliate WLS. Authorities say at least 10 people have died as a result of the storm. In Weymouth, Massachusetts, on Monday, a 57-year old pedestrian died after she was struck by a snowplow. The accident occurred at a condominium complex, and the incident is under investigation. Two people died in car accidents in Nebraska as a result of slippery roads Sunday. The deaths occurred in Saunders and Lancaster counties, authorities said. In Ohio, Toledo Police Officer Michael Greenwood died while shoveling snow at home Sunday, a police spokesman said. The six other deaths are one in Michigan, two in New York, two in Wisconsin and one in Pennsylvania. Boston declared a snow emergency and banned on-street parking as snow piled up.  City schools will be closed again Tuesday. The storm even forced Boston Mayor Marty Walsh to postpone the victory parade for the New England Patriots, who won the Super Bowl on Sunday night. The parade, which had been scheduled for Tuesday, will now happen a day later. New Yorkers were told to be prepared for roads and sidewalks to turn icy as temperatures plummeted.  Overnight lows hit the single digits with wind chills knocking them into negative numbers. Back in the Midwest, scores of schools closed Monday as Chicago coped with the snow.  Most schools systems will be back open Tuesday. In Omaha, Nebraska, wet, heavy snow tested even heavy-duty snow blowers, CNN affiliate KETV reported. ""It kept coming and coming and coming,"" Frank Halpine said. Monday was another ugly day for air travelers as more than 4,300 flights were canceled, according to Flightaware.com.  Another 500 flights have been scrubbed for Tuesday as well. United, Delta, American, Virgin America, U.S. Airways, Southwest, Spirit and JetBlue all issued waivers that allow travelers to change flights without a penalty. The air travel headache started over the weekend, with thousands of  flights canceled Sunday, many of them in and out of Chicago.  Boston, New York and Detroit were also hard hit. Pennsylvania groundhog Punxsutawney Phil didn't have to suffer the snow, but still forecast six more weeks of winter at his annual Groundhog Day appearance Monday. Legend has it that if Phil sees his shadow,  there will be six more weeks of winter weather. If he doesn't, there will be an early spring. Nan Moore, who was visiting Punxsutawney to witness the prediction, correctly predicted the rodent's forecast. ""He's going to see his shadow,"" she said. ""We're going to get more winter.""

"Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN) -- Almost overnight, a patchwork of plastic tents appeared on an empty piece of land less than 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) from the World Cup stadium as a show of force from Sao Paulo's working poor. In a matter of weeks, more than 3,000 families joined the squatters settlement known as the ""People's Cup,"" hoping to use the global sporting event as a platform to pressure the government to provide low-income housing. On a recent morning, Jucilene de Oliveira was working in the communal kitchen -- a lean-to made from plastic tarps and plywood -- preparing lunch for families in her quadrant. She said her rent in Sao Paulo's East Zone nearly doubled when the stadium was being built. ""We paid 700 reais ($314) on rent, then food and clothes, it was too much,"" she says. She, her husband and four daughters now camp out in a small tent stacked with mattresses, hoping to persuade the government to build subsidized housing on the occupied land. ""We don't want anything for free, but we need something we can pay,"" said the young manicurist. ""If we can pay 700 reais a month for rent, we could pay that in installments for a housing unit."" Rising rent . During the day, the tent city is a maze of mostly empty lean-tos. New arrivals show up to pitch tents and get themselves on the list of house seekers coordinated by the Homeless Workers Movement. Sometimes it is an entire family living in a tent. In other tents, family members take turns in spending the night there. Rents in the city have risen by double digits in recent years, far outpacing the increase in minimum wage, which is $360 a month in Sao Paulo. In the East Zone, a simple two-room apartment now costs around $300. But it is hard to say whether the World Cup has had an impact on rents as the increases have been felt across the city, not just in the East Zone where the stadium was built. At night, thousands of people pour into the settlement as families return from work and others show up for the nightly assembly. They tell us they won't even watch the World Cup now. ""I always liked the World Cup. I was Brazilian through and through,"" says one woman. ""But this Cup and the stadium are making people angry."" Maria das Dores takes the stage to lead the group in a rally. ""Let's hear it for quadrant G1,"" she shouts and is greeted by a cheer from the crowd. Das Dores has been coordinating land invasions for the movement for eight years. She says the World Cup has done nothing for Brazil's lowest classes. ""The World Cup and the stadium here in the East Zone aren't going to leave the legacy that was expected,"" she says. ""The legacy is higher rents and pushing people further outside of the city to the peripheries."" Popular pressure . In the protests leading up to the games, The Homeless Workers Movement has become the biggest force out on the streets of Sao Paulo, with marches of more than 10,000. They lash out at the government for spending $11 billion on the World Cup instead of schools, hospitals and public housing. All the pressure appears to have paid off. The government said this week that it is drawing up plans to build low-income housing on the land occupied by the People's Cup and that details of the project will be made public this month. But the families at the tent city say they're ready to march on the Sao Paulo stadium at a moment's notice if those guarantees fall through.","More than 3,000 families have put up tents and lean-tos near World Cup stadium .

"Actor and director Clint Eastwood made the day of the GOP faithful at the Republican National Convention when he gave a surprise speech Thursday night in which he laid out what he sees as the good, the bad and the ugly state of American political affairs. And he did it all while addressing an ""invisible"" President Barack Obama sitting in an empty chair. Eastwood, who played the iconic tough guy character ""Dirty Harry"" during his long career in Hollywood, fired up the party base when he said he cried when Obama was elected and cried even harder years later when millions were out of work. TIME.com: Best Eastwood-related tweets . ""It's a national disgrace,"" Eastwood said. ""It may be time for someone else to come along and solve the problem."" CNN Facebook poll: Did Eastwood make your day with his speech? At times, Eastwood sent the crowd into laughing fits when he pretended Obama was offering colorful objections. ""What do you want me to tell Romney?"" Eastwood asked the empty chair. ""I can't tell him to do that to himself ... you're getting as bad as Biden ... of course we all know Biden is the intellect of the Democratic Party. Kind of a grin with a body behind it ..."" The RNC had left room for a ""mystery guest"" on its Thursday schedule and announced Thursday that Eastwood would speak. Late Thursday afternoon, Eastwood walked through the convention floor for a brief rundown of the night's events. His ad-libbed speech later in the evening was decidedly political, bitingly satirical and more than a bit, well....rambling. CNNMoney.com: Eastwood's inflated unemployment count . ""I think if you just step aside and Mr. Romney can kind of take over.  You can maybe still use a plane,"" Eastwood said. Seconds after Eastwood finished his speech, the Twittersphere was buzzing with response. Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics tweeted: . ""I'd feel better if I knew for sure that Clint doesn't see anyone in the chair. :)"" Comedian Roseanne Barr tweeted:  ""clint eastwood is CRAY"" Actor George Takei tweeted that he could use the Eastwood tactic at next week's Democratic National Convention. ""I'm drafting a DNC speech to imaginary Romney in an empty factory,"" Takei's tweet said. Actress Mia Farrow tweeted that she thought Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who introduced Mitt Romney later in the evening, was the night's best speaker -- with one problem: ""Rude to ignore invisible Obama sitting right there."" The Twitter handle ""Invisible Obama,"" which said it was sitting ""Stage left of Clint Eastwood,"" quipped that ""The GOP built me."" An hour after Eastwood's speech, it already had 20,000 followers. The move spawned a new trend with people posting photos of themselves pointing at empty chairs with the hashtag ""eastwooding."" Comedy Central's Indecision Tumblr posted a summary that read: ""I was talking to Barack Obama the other day. ... Potato. Sneaker. Fish. Pizza. Algebra. Racecar."" Comedic takes on Eastwood's speech went viral and all of a sudden, what might have been for some younger viewers a ho-hum speech by an octogenarian actor became both a national joke and a means to engage in the political process, political experts said. ""It was campaign malpractice that the Romney managers sent out a dithering, clueless Clint Eastwood. The Romney campaign will be lucky if Eastwood's antics don't linger as a national punch line,"" Sabato wrote on his ""Crystal Ball"" blog. Sabato also noted that fallout from Eastwood's vaudevillian like schtick overshadowed ""Sen. Marco Rubio, whose dazzling speech to his home state conclave might end up being as nationally invisible as the imaginary Barack Obama sitting in Clint's stage chair."" A Romney campaign aide addressed Romney's appearance later, saying, ""Judging an American icon like Clint Eastwood through a typical political lens doesn't work. His ad-libbing was a break from all the political speeches, and the crowd enjoyed it. He rightly pointed out that 23 million Americans out of work or underemployed is a national disgrace and it's time for a change."" Opinion: Why did GOP invite Clint Eastwood? But political fact checkers immediately pounced on the 23 million unemployment figure. The U.S. Labor Department, says there are 12.8 million unemployed peopleâ€”not 23 million. Eastwood, a longtime Republican, endorsed Romney at an Idaho fundraiser at the beginning of August, where he told reporters that he was backing the GOP presidential candidate ""because I think the country needs a boost somewhere."" He endorsed Sen. John McCain in the 2008 presidential election. Earlier this year during in an ad that aired during the Super Bowl, Eastwood's familiar, sandpaper voice spoke to Americans about the nation's economic woes. The ad featured close-up shots of factory workers and black-and-white photos of Midwest families -- images some political watchers flagged as subtly political. ""It's halftime in America, too,"" said the 81-year-old Hollywood legend. ""People are out of work, and they're hurting. And they're all wondering what they're gonna do to make a comeback. And we're all scared because this isn't a game. The people of Detroit know a little something about this. They almost lost everything. But we all pulled together, now Motor City is fighting again."" Eastwood said any implication of politics was baseless.Stars react to Clint Eastwood .","Actor and director Clint Eastwood uses humor, satire to deride Obama's performance .

"Joran van der Sloot pleaded guilty Wednesday to all the charges against him in the 2010 killing of a Peruvian woman. ""I am really sorry for what happened,"" he told the three magistrates overseeing his trial in Lima, Peru, after pleading guilty to the ""qualified murder"" and simple robbery of Stephany Flores. There is no jury. The 24-year-old Dutch national faces a sentence of 30 years in prison, but his attorney hopes his plea, called an ""anticipated conclusion of the process,"" will reduce that term. He will be sentenced Friday morning. Enrique Flores, brother of the victim, said the family did not attend court Wednesday but will be in the courtroom gallery for sentencing. The Peruvian murder case garnered global attention in part because of the circumstances of the killing, but also because van der Sloot was arrested twice but never charged in the 2005 disappearance of U.S. teenager Natalee Holloway in Aruba. ""I was just happy to see that the Flores family finally got justice,"" Dave Holloway, Natalee Holloway's father, told HLN's Nancy Grace. ""I just hope that on Friday that he gets the proper sentence that he deserves."" After entering his plea, van der Sloot was red-faced and frowning.  He hung his head as his attorney made a plea for a reduced sentence. ""He was pointed at and persecuted. The world had been against him for five years before this case, for a murder he said he never committed and for which there is no evidence whatsoever,"" said attorney Jose Luis Jimenez. Prosecutors objected to Jimenez bringing up the Holloway case in the courtroom. Afterward, van der Sloot smiled and gestured with his attorney. Dave Holloway said he was ""kind of surprised"" that van der Sloot's defense attorney used the Holloway case and the death of van der Sloot's father in an attempt to reduce his sentence, saying they created stress for him. ""He created all this -- if he has any stress -- created all this stress himself,"" Holloway said. ""I just don't buy it."" ""This individual is a psychopath and a psychopath cannot be freed because if that happens he becomes a danger to society,"" Edwar Alvarez, the attorney for the Flores family, said after the hearing. Van der Sloot began to plead guilty during a hearing last Friday, but at the last moment asked for more time to ""reflect"" on it. Police say van der Sloot killed Flores in his Lima hotel room in May 2010, then took money and bank cards from her wallet and fled to Chile, where he was arrested a few days later. Van der Sloot sues nation of Chile . On Friday, prosecutors went over all their evidence and witnesses and gave a summation of the case. During the hearing, a judge criticized van der Sloot for yawning, slouching and showing disrespect to the court. Jimenez said his client had been transferred to the courthouse at 6 a.m. and was kept in a hot holding cell for four hours, wearing a bulletproof vest and jacket the whole time. He hadn't slept well because he was nervous about the process and was handcuffed the entire time, Jimenez said. The lawyer asked the court to handle van der Sloot's arrival differently Wednesday, but there were no assurances that would happen, he said. Investigators believe van der Sloot killed Flores after she found something related to the Holloway case on van der Sloot's computer as she visited with him in his hotel room.  Holloway, an Alabama teen who vanished in 2005 while on a graduation trip to Aruba, was last seen leaving a nightclub with van der Sloot and two other men.  Her disappearance is still unsolved. The Peruvian victim's family, including her father, Ricardo Flores, had pushed for stiffer charges. While his Peruvian trial wraps up, van der Sloot also faces possible extradition to the United States. In June 2010, a federal grand jury in Alabama indicted him on charges of wire fraud and extortion.  Prosecutors say he demanded more than $250,000 from Holloway's family in return for disclosing the location of her body. He was allegedly given a total of $25,000, and authorities believe he used that money to travel to Peru and participate in a poker tournament, where he met Flores. Dave Holloway said Wednesday he doesn't believe Aruban authorities will ever be able to prosecute van der Sloot in his daughter's disappearance. ""To some extent, you try to hold in your mind that this sentencing coming up Friday will help out, and just knowing he's behind bars will help out,"" he said. ""... You've just got to, you know, take a step back and say, 'He's behind bars and that's probably as good as we're going to get.'"" A probate judge in Jefferson County, Alabama, on Thursday will consider a request to have Natalee Holloway declared dead. Dave Holloway filed the petition.""This is a normal proceeding for families when a loved one has been missing for an extended period of time,"" his attorney said last year. Dave Holloway's former wife and Natalee's mother, Beth Holloway, had no comment Wednesday.","Hearing Thursday regarding possible Holloway death declaration .

"Santa Rosa, Peru (CNN) -- Murder suspect Joran van der Sloot arrived Friday in Peru to face charges that he killed a Peruvian woman as police in Lima said they had identified the weapon that killed 21-year-old Stephany Flores Ramirez. Flores' body was found Wednesday in a Lima hotel room registered to van der Sloot, a Dutch citizen who was twice arrested and released in connection with the 2005 disappearance of an American teenager, Natalee Holloway, in Aruba. Investigators also found a baseball bat in the room, two law enforcement sources -- who said it was the murder weapon -- told HLN's ""Nancy Grace."" Chilean authorities delivered van der Sloot to their Peruvian counterparts in the border town of Santa Rosa, where he was greeted by hecklers and dozens of media personnel jostling for position to get a better picture of the Dutch citizen. Paperwork showed that van der Sloot entered Chile the same day Flores' body was found, Chilean police told CNN. He was captured in Chile on Thursday and flown Friday aboard a military aircraft to the border to be expelled, said Macarena Lopez, a spokeswoman for Interpol. The Chileans drove Van der Sloot across the border to a Peruvian police station. He made a 100-foot walk from the car to the station as journalists pushed past a police line and a handful of hecklers rained loud and angry obscenities on the suspect's head. Van der Sloot was taken inside the station for processing. From there, he was to be taken to the nearby town of Tanca and then flown to Lima. Holloway was on a high school graduation trip to the Caribbean island of Aruba in 2005 when she disappeared. Van der Sloot was arrested twice in connection with the case but released both times. He denied any involvement and has not been charged. The family of Stephany Flores Ramirez, the woman found dead in van der Sloot's hotel room, said Friday they had mixed emotions about the suspect's capture and return to face charges in Peru. ""I cannot say that I was happy,"" brother Enrique Flores told CNN's Rafael Romo. ""I feel a little relief in this pain that I have and that my family has. This pain that won't go away ... We want this action not to happen again."" Stephany's sister-in-law Carolina Jorge was more outspoken. ""We need justice for our family, for Natalee's family,"" she said. Stephany's father, Ricardo, was more wistful and philosophical. ""My daughter had everything in life,"" the businessman and race car driver said. ""Perhaps my error was to show her the pretty side of the world. I didn't show her that there was the other side to the world -- the evilness."" The family said they thought Stephany had been abducted until authorities found her body. Her burial was Thursday. Van der Sloot's former attorney, Joseph Tacopina, told CNN it was too early to reach any conclusions. ""I just think we need to take a step back before we get to the 'I told you so' stage, and let's see what the evidence is here,"" Tacopina said Thursday. Tacopina said he is not representing van der Sloot and no longer has a good relationship with the family. Van der Sloot also faces an arrest warrant on charges of extortion and wire fraud in Alabama, U.S. Attorney Joyce Vance said Thursday. The charges are unrelated to the killing of the Peruvian woman and deal with an attempt to sell details about Holloway for $250,000, Vance said. Van der Sloot, 23, was traveling alone in a taxi near the Chilean central coastal city of Vina del Mar Thursday when he was detained, said Douglas Rodriguez, spokesman for the Chilean Investigative Police. TV images showed him emerging from a black police SUV at the police station. His hair, which had been dark in previous images, was red and worn in a close-cropped crew cut. There is ""incriminating evidence"" linking van der Sloot to the killing of Flores, said Peruvian criminal investigator Cesar Guardia Vasquez. The woman's bludgeoned body was found in Room 309 of the Hotel Tac in the Miraflores section of Lima, police said. She suffered blunt trauma to the head, breaking her neck, and to her torso and back, Peruvian police said Thursday. Van der Sloot had been staying at the hotel since arriving from Colombia on May 14, police said. Room 309 was booked in his name, authorities said. A hotel guest and an employee witnessed the pair entering the hotel room together at 5 a.m. Sunday, Guardia said. Police have video of van der Sloot and Flores together the previous night at the Atlantic City Casino in Lima, he said. Two Peruvian cab drivers said in an interview on CNN affiliate America TV that they drove a man matching van der Sloot's description to a city on the other side of the Chilean border. ""He paid me and I took him to Arica, to the border,"" cab driver Oswaldo Aparcana said. The man sat in the front seat and smoked many cigarettes, Aparcana said. The passenger told the cabbies he used to live in Aruba, said the other driver, Carlos Alberto Uribe. Holloway, the Alabama teenager, disappeared May 30, 2005, five years to the day since the hotel videotape that officials say showed van der Sloot and Flores going into his hotel room. Both women are reported to have met van der Sloot at a night spot. Ricardo Flores said police found his daughter's car about 50 blocks from the hotel. Inside the car, he said, authorities found pills like those used in date rapes. Ricardo Flores said he did not believe his daughter knew the Dutch citizen beforehand. Both of them speak English and they struck up conversation at the casino, he said. Interpol had alerted its office in Chile and other bordering countries of the case and placed them on alert in case van der Sloot tried to leave that country, Peruvian Interpol Interim Director Gerson Ortiz told CNN. Van der Sloot was arrested in Aruba in 2005 along with two other men, brothers Deepak and Satish Kalpoe, in connection with Holloway's disappearance. They were later released. In 2007, they were arrested a second time after Aruba's then-chief prosecutor, Hans Mos, said he had received new evidence in the case. Van der Sloot, who was attending college in the Netherlands, was brought back to Aruba. But judges ruled the new evidence -- which included an Internet chat the same day Holloway disappeared in which one of the three youths said she was dead -- was not enough to keep them jailed. In 2008, prosecutors sought unsuccessfully to arrest van der Sloot a third time after a videotape surfaced on Dutch television. In it, van der Sloot tells a man he considered to be his friend that he had sex with Holloway on the beach after leaving the nightclub, then she ""started shaking"" and lost consciousness. He said he panicked when he could not resuscitate her and called a friend who had a boat. The two put Holloway's body in the boat, he said, and then he went home. The friend told him the next day that he had carried the body out and dumped it in the ocean. But an Aruba court ruled there was not enough evidence to re-arrest him. Aruban prosecutors said authorities had met with van der Sloot in the Netherlands, but in a two-hour interview he denied any role in Holloway's disappearance.

"Taylor Swift will be welcoming you to New York for the next year, but many of the city's residents are already wishing the megastar had stayed in Nashville. Taylor Swift? What about Jennifer Lopez, Jay Z or even Jerry Seinfeld? Named the city's first Global Welcome Ambassador for its ""Welcome To New York"" campaign -- she has a song of the same name -- Swift is attracting criticism as a carpetbagger. She bought a $19.9 million apartment in Manhattan's Tribeca neighborhood this year. It's not exactly the act of a struggling artist from elsewhere, inspired by Frank Sinatra to roll the dice on the city that never sleeps. Or even a local girl from the Bronx riding the 6 train to make it in Manhattan. Her lack of New York tenure led many to question why she's qualified to define New York-isms like the bodega (corner market), the stoop (stairs used like a front porch) and how to say Houston Street (""how-stun""). Taylor Swift's new single to benefit NYC schools . And picking a latte as the food of choice for the city? ""Yes, we all know New York lattes -- maple ones -- hold special significance for Swift,"" writes Tessa Stuart in the Village Voice, ""but a latte is not like a slice of pizza, or a bagel, or a pickleback, which is to say it is not a quintessentially, or even an overtly, New York foodstuff."" We are not questioning the power of her brand, her kindness to her many adoring fans or her uncanny ability to nail the breakup song. (Listen to ""Mean"" and ""We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together"" and you'll see.) An ambassador to our country's largest and most exciting and diverse city doesn't have to be born there. But surely she needs to have done something there besides spend money and drink lattes. Of course, she's not selling the real New York, where working-class people struggle to find affordable housing (never mind buying a home); where rising retail rents are pushing independent bars, music venues and shops out for ""one size fits all"" chain stores. She's selling the shiny, clean version that's sanitized and easy and won't snatch your wallet. Maybe she'll get her hands dirty, learn some tough lessons from the city -- despite her money -- and earn her title to represent those 8 million stories that rapper Kurtis Blow loves. In the meantime, we prefer the real version, represented by native and transplanted New Yorkers we love. That's why CNN nominates the following folks who have made a real mark on the city to be our New York global ambassadors. Jennifer Lopez . We know J.Lo spent a cool $22 million to buy an apartment overlooking Madison Square Park, but really, the superstar singer/actress/dancer is a good Puerto Rican girl from the Bronx. And the Bronx, the birthplace of hip-hop and so much good food and culture, deserves its share of tourists. Spike Lee . Spike Lee knows New York. He grew up in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Fort Greene, his parents still live there, and he keeps an office there. And he's angry that gentrification is pushing many African-Americans out while services are improving for the richer, often white, residents moving into the neighborhood. This year at a Black History Month lecture, Lee said his father, a jazz musician, bought a brownstone 46 years ago. And the new neighbors ""called the cops on my father. He's not -- he doesn't even play electric bass. It's acoustic. We bought the motherf***in' house in 1968, and now you call the cops?"" DJ Kool Herc . Some pinpoint the birthplace of hip-hop as a rec room in the Bronx where DJ Kool Herc and his sister launched a back-to-school party in 1973. He has not made the millions that others have made off his creativity, but he gets the credit for a music style the put the Bronx on the map. And CNN's own Anthony Bourdain thinks he's cool. Jerry Seinfeld . New Yorkers recognize the Soup Nazi with his strict rules for how you may buy his food, the Postal Service that changes its rules on a daily basis, the lousy diner that stays open for some ungodly reason. Brooklyn-born comedian Jerry Seinfeld, who popularized these concepts, is already an informal ambassador to New York. Seinfeld sold his twisted, grumpy, ""Seinfeld"" version of New York for nine seasons on NBC, and he became a multimillionaire as a result. See his 1990s New York on episodes in syndication and his favorite clips on his website. Fran Lebowitz . Though we love noted writer and speaker Fran Lebowitz's work, we admit there's one slight problem with her nomination: She hates tourism. ""Tourism as a number-one industry is a terrible, terrible idea for any city, especially New York,"" she told Paper magazine. ""If you were going to turn a city, which is a place where people live, into a tourist attraction, you're going to have to make it a place that people who don't live here, like. So I object to living in a place for people who don't live here. As it became more and more intense, it became more and more a place where the actual citizens are pushed out to the edges."" The Naked Cowboy . Who doesn't love Times Square's Naked Cowboy, known off-duty as Robert Burck? Our favorite cowboy isn't totally clothes-free: For more than 15 years, he's worn his tight white briefs, a cowboy hat and boots for his street performances. Pictures from all over the world crowd his Facebook page, showing lots of sequins and other decor on his derriere. Hey, every city needs a little sex appeal. Lena Dunham (tentative) Yes, we know New York native Dunham is new besties with Swift. Maybe. Dunham's boyfriend, Jack Antonoff (of the group fun.) co-wrote two songs on Swift's new album, so it could be a mix of business and pleasure. But she works and breathes and lives her show, ""Girls,"" in the city. If she could just reflect a more diverse New York than the homogenous city that exists in ""Girls,"" we might move her out of the ""tentative"" category. In 2000, Brooklyn was about 41% white, 36% black, 8% Asian and 20% Hispanic (of any race). Time to wake up and smell the demographics. Jay Z .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Umbrellas, yellow ribbons, numbered codewords and tangles of phone cords: these are the distinctive sights of the dramatic protest unfolding beneath Hong Kong's spectacular skyline. Here are some of the defining images to have emerged from the days of pro-democracy protest that have rocked the semi-autonomous Chinese territory, and the reasons behind them. The umbrella . The key symbol of the protests that have upended Hong Kong is the humble umbrella. Since it was used to shield protesters from the tear gas and pepper spray deployed by police, the umbrella has become a ubiquitous sight on the frontlines, and given the movement its name. Protesters are bringing in umbrellas in bulk and distributing them for free, sleeping under their shelter and writing slogans on them. Bryan Druzin, an assistant professor of law at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said the umbrella was not only functional but had ""a certain emblematic resonance in that it's a symbol of passive resistance."" ""Hong Kong is a city that periodically takes refuge under umbrellas against seasonal typhoons that threaten the city. The turmoil is another storm Hong Kong is trying to weather,"" he said. Hong Kong artist Kacey Wong has been generating protest art by running a social media ""competition"" to create a lasting logo for ""the Umbrella Revolution"" (the prizes being ""justice, democracy and freedom""). He said the way the umbrella was used brought an ""enormous feeling of brotherhood."" ""Tank Man -- that was one guy standing in front of a tank,"" says Wong. ""The umbrella represents people working with each other to form a defensive shield. If you see a piece of the shield ripped away by the police, it will be replaced by another."" It was a strong image with an inherent contrast, he said. ""It's a soft thing but it's also very hard in terms of our determination to win this battle."" Yellow ribbons . Yellow ribbons are tied to barricade railings, pinned on shirts, and decorate social media profiles. Long an emblem of suffrage movements internationally -- particularly tied to women's suffrage -- they have been adopted by Hong Kong's protesters as a symbol of democratic aspiration. ""Not everyone can be there on the front lines,"" says Wong. ""The ribbon is a way to show your support."" Black tees . The student protesters are mostly dressed in black t-shirts. Black has traditionally been worn at the city's annual protests to mark the Tiananmen massacre; Wong says they also represent ""sorrow and darkness"" regarding the use of force on peaceful demonstrators. Numbers . The protest site reads like a telephone directory of numbers, emblazoned on notes and posters plastered around the streets: 689, 926, 8964. They also figure heavily in social media posts about the protests. The numbers are a form of shorthand common to Chinese political culture in Hong Kong and in mainland China, explains Wong. In the mainland, he says, due to censorship, ""you have to speak in a curveball way. There's a lot of coded words they use because they cannot express it directly."" Although no such censorship exists in Hong Kong, the same political shorthand is commonplace, said Druzin. Dates are often used: #926 refers to September 26, when the protests kicked off, #8964 to the date of the Tiananmen crackdown. Hong Kong chief executive C.Y. Leung, the main target of the protesters' ire, has his own code: 689. It refers to the number of votes he received from Hong Kong's 1,200-strong election committee to rise to office as the territory's leader. ""They use it to question his legitimacy because he was voted for by only 689 people in Hong Kong,"" said Wong. ""They call him that to remind people he doesn't represent all of us -- there's 7 million of us here."" Protesters devoted a bus in a blockaded area to Leung, plastering it with messages to the chief executive. Above the bus's windshield, the route number was changed to ""689,"" the destination to ""Hell."" Supplies . The protest sites are notably orderly, well-organized and clean. Volunteers hand out free bottled water, snacks, towels and medicine. Bananas are dispensed, as are loaves of breads and saltine crackers. Demonstrators bring carts laden with grocery bags of supplies, which are dispensed for free to whoever needs them. Trash is sorted into three piles for recycling -- plastic, paper and garbage -- and volunteers patrol with plastic garbage bags to collect trash. Homemade protection . After Hong Kong protesters were tear gassed on Sunday, many improvised their own protection, using some of the materials circulated by the Occupy Wall Street movement. Solutions included wrapping exposed skin in Saran plastic wrap, or using swimming goggles and plastic ponchos. Charging stations . Some people that live close to the protests are offering to let protesters charge their cell phones. They post signs with their contact numbers if people need to use their power supply. Volunteers have brought power strips and extra chargers so protesters can stay connected. Phones have played an invaluable role throughout the protests as information is shared through social media. FireChat . Rumors that the cell phone network would be shut down sparked a massive rush in Hong Kong to download the FireChat messaging app. The app allows users to message each other without WiFi or cell data connection. The demand has been so great that Micha Benoliel, the CEO of the U.S. company Open Garden which developed the app, has come out to Hong Kong during the protests. The protesters are well organized and well prepared, said Benoliel. ""They knew that at some point the cellular networks would be shut down or just be overloaded by number of people in the same place, so they know that Firechat is a way to remain connected and communicate."" With one caveat -- all conversations on FireChat are public because any user can join the messaging rooms. Phones have another use. Candles are long out of vogue as phones are easy, convenient and a non-fire way of providing light in a massive night gathering. Photographed from above, the glowing screens of mobile phones held aloft by the sea of protesters' have created an enduring image of the demonstrators' solidarity. Effigies . Hong Kong chief executive CY Leung has been the main target of the protesters' anger, with calls for him to resign circulating among the crowds. A gigantic, enlarged effigy of Leung's head, replete with fangs, has been a distinctive sight on the streets during the protests. Protesters chant in Cantonese, ""Step down, step down!"" when they see it. Anthem . The rousing anthem, ""Do you hear the people sing"" from the revolution-themed musical ""Les Miserables,"" has been adopted by the protesters. The slogan is painted on a poster hanging from a prominent bridge and has been played by a string quartet on the streets. In the musical, the song is sung as Parisian revolutionaries prepare to rebel against the government.","The umbrella has emerged as the defining symbol of Hong Kong's democracy protests .

"(CNN)Headed to the Super Bowl this weekend? Bring your money, foam finger and tickets -- heck, even bring your face paint -- but please leave your drone at home. At least that's what the Federal Aviation Administration wants. The FAA released a 15-second video on YouTube Wednesday reminding everyone that the Super Bowl is a ""No Drone Zone."" The video features pictures of football fans tailgating and cheering in the stands, with a narrator imploring people ""don't spoil the game"" by bringing drones. It ends with the hashtag #nodronezone. On Super Bowl Sunday, the FAA will establish a virtual no-fly zone around the University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, where Super Bowl XLIX will be played. Unmanned aircraft, such as drones, won't be allowed within 30 miles of the stadium from an hour before game time until well after the game is over, according to an FAA statement. Michael Steinbach, the FBI's assistant director of counterterrorism said Super Bowl security is a huge task. ""The Super Bowl, like any large public event — the FBI starts planning along with local law enforcement, authorities on the ground, and DHS months and months beforehand,"" he said. The uptick in the use of drones adds one more wrinkle to security planners' jobs. But according to Steinbach, it's the FBI's job to focus on stopping the threat as opposed to trying to react to specific tools terrorists may use. ""I'm concerned about drones, I'm concerned about guns, I'm concerned about bombs, cars -- that's just the tool. I'm more concerned about the actor, I'm more concerned about the threat."" The FAA is waging an education campaign on drone safety after several incidents of drones getting too close to commercial aircraft. FAA Administrator Michael Huerta has said pilots have reported up to 25 cases per month of drones flying above the regulated limit of 400 feet, with some flying as high as 2,000 feet in the air. Huerta said the FAA is working to educate people about the dangers of flying drones that high, because enforcement of rules on the small, unmanned aerial vehicles can be difficult. Drones are sparking security concerns as well. Earlier this week, a government employee crashed his drone on the grounds of the White House. President Barack Obama and the first lady weren't at home at the time. No one was injured, and the Secret Service is investigating. CNN's Wesley Bruer contributed to this report.","FAA releases video reminding everyone that the Super Bowl is a ""No Drone Zone""

"President Barack Obama, who will act on immigration reform by the end of the year, and his administration have not finalized plans on the issue, but he's aware of the general details in the expected plan, according to sources in the government and elsewhere who have been briefed on the White House plans. At the end of the day it will all come down to what the legal team thinks can be defended in court, in addition to some political considerations, sources say. ""It's not like this is the Academy Awards,"" one official told CNN recently, meaning that the contents of the envelope are not a surprise. Citing his legal authority as chief executive of the United States, Obama said in a press conference in Myanmar Friday that he would act on immigration reform by the end of the year. ""I believe that America is a nation of immigrants,"" the President said. Everybody agrees that the system is broken; there has been ample opportunity for Congress to pass a bipartisan immigration bill that would strengthen our borders, improve the legal immigration system and lift millions of people out of the shadows so that they are paying taxes and getting right by the law."" The senior White House official who spoke to CNN said that any executive action could come as soon as this week. The White House is also not going to yield to threats of a shutdown. Asked Tuesday about a potential scenario in which Congressional Republicans would try to defund Obama's immigration action in an upcoming spending bill. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Wednesday that the president's actions would be within the law. ""We would consider it to be unwarranted for Republicans in Congress to try to undo that executive action using the budget process,"" Earnest told reporters, casting doubt that such an a move would ""determine the outcome at all"" of Obama's actions. Warnings from Republicans are not affecting White House plans, according to the official, who said the White House is not going to command less in the executive action order just to appease furious lawmakers. Obama Friday encouraged Congress to act on immigration and said he told Republican congressional leaders that he was interested in working on a legislative solution, but without that he would act. ""I indicated to (House) Speaker (John) Boehner several months ago that if in fact Congress failed to act I would use all the lawful authority that I possess to try and make the system work better. And that's gonna happen, that's gonna happen before the end of the year,"" said Obama. The senior White House official said that before issuing any order the president will review his administration's proposals for extending deportation relief to undocumented immigrants with American-born children and those who entered the United States as children themselves. Another senior administration official told CNN that the main contours of the executive action are three-fold: direct immigration agents to allow parents of children who are American citizens to obtain documents that allows them to stay in the United States legally, protect illegal immigrants who came to the United States as children and make clear deportation should still be the policy for convicted criminals. The plans appear to exclude any parents of ""Dreamers,"" those who were brought in illegally as children who already have deferred action themselves from Obama's earlier action, according to sources. Though the general details of the plan are known, it is still in flux, and may change by the time it is announced, according to two other sources briefed on the subject who shared more in-depth details under consideration with CNN. Those sources said that the plan includes a focus on deporting criminal illegal immigrants. The final number of immigrants shielded will be affected by restrictions such as whether people with police infractions such as a DUI can qualify, they said. The plan would include an expansion of visas in certain categories of workers such as those in the technology industry, which is popular with the business community, and more resources to protect the border, according to the sources. The move has been the subject of months of anticipation. But with lame duck legislative wrangling underway on Capitol Hill, the president's advisers could also wait until next month to make a final decision on how to repair a system both Republicans and Democrats admit needs fixing. And while officials say the specifics of what he will announce haven't been finalized, the broad outlines of a potential plan that eases deportations for millions of undocumented immigrants have been floated by immigration groups for months. For the multitude of groups who are watching the process unfold, the moment is charged. ""Without hesitation I can say the level of anticipation is intense. We were hoping this would happen in September,"" said Clarissa Martinez, deputy vice president of the National Council of La Raza. ""It's long overdue. The sooner the better."" Millions affected . An expansion of Obama's ""deferred action"" program (DACA) that went into place in the summer of 2012 is considered to be a likely component of Obama's immigration action, according to two sources close to the plan who spoke to CNN. DACA delayed deportation proceedings for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States by their parents as children. In the DACA plan there were caveats on who was eligible. In order to apply, immigrants needed to be younger than 31 at the time the rule was enacted, and younger than 16 when they were brought to the United States. And applicants are required to either be in school, have earned a high school degree or be honorably discharged veterans. The Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, says 1.2 million people were eligible under those rules and nearly 700,000 applied for deferred deportation, with hundreds of thousands more aging into the requirements over the next decade. But many more would become eligible if Obama expands, or eliminates altogether, those requirements, which were meant to encompass the same sector that would have qualified for permanent resident status under the DREAM Act, which has languished in Congress. The sources said that some parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents, or so-called ""green-card holders,"" would be granted legal status that allows them to work and avoid deportation. The President's plan would affect those parents who have been in the United States five years. That move would bring another 3.4 million people into the eligibility ranks, according to a Migration Policy Institute analysis. According to the two sources who spoke to CNN, any executive action is not expected to include broader use of so-called ""parole"" status. While some pro-immigration advocates support this idea, it is seen as a red line by many conservatives who view it as a potential way to provide a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants who are parents of U.S. citizens. Currently such parole status is provided to spouses and family members of people serving in the U.S. military. If the parents of children who are eligible under the current DACA rules were included, the number would rise to 3.7 million. Changing those rules could also expand the eligible population: eliminating the education requirement, for example, would allow 430,000 more undocumented immigrants to be eligible for deferred deportation, the Migration Policy Institute estimates. And allowing people over 30 who were brought to the United States by undocumented parents would allow another 200,000 immigrants to apply, the think-tank's report says. Immigration activists, frustrated with the rate of deportations under Obama and further exasperated with the delay in Obama's immigration action, have been urging the White House to go big and expand the deferred deportation order in a way that allows the maximum number of people to stay. But many who have been watching the process closely believe the eventual announcement will fall short of those appeals. Political football . Whatever Obama finally decides -- and at this point, the options seem clear -- he'll be met with fierce blowback from Republicans on Capitol Hill, who have spent months preparing for the announcement by warning of executive overreach and political well-poisoning. The White House yielded to politics once already, delaying the immigration announcement from its promised debut this summer to a new date before the end of this year. The move was meant to shield vulnerable Democrats from political attacks on the topic; many of them lost their races anyway. The postponement wasn't met kindly from immigration groups, who said there wasn't time to spare on providing deportation relief for the millions of people who could be affected by new rules. There could still be election year ramifications, since Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu remains locked in a runoff contest with a Republican rival. But with the Senate firmly in Republican hands, any further delay would seem to offer little political advantage while only eroding support further among immigration reform activists. ""For us, every day that there's a delay, and every day that people have to wait, means more people unjustly deported,"" said Praeli. Some Democrats want Obama to wait to announce the executive action after essential business clears the House and Senate. Sen. Harry Reid, the outgoing Senate Majority Leader, told CNN the president should hold off any immigration action until a new bill funding the federal government is approved. He said enacting the immigration plan ahead of the spending measure could anger Republicans and risk a government shutdown. ""I'd like to get the finances of this country out of the way before he does it. But it's up to him,"" Reid said. But no matter when the action comes, it seems destined to ignite GOP furor. The near certainty of an executive action by year's end hasn't slowed Republican efforts to stop it: this week a Republican congressman from Texas, Rep. Joe Barton, said if Obama goes forward with the plan, impeachment proceedings could be a possibility. Those threats aren't exactly a new thing. Democrats have raised millions of dollars by warning their party's base about impeachment threats from conservative House members. More real is the threat that taking executive action on immigration forestalls any legislative effort on the matter. GOP leaders on Capitol Hill say a new plan delaying deportations would enrage Republicans, leaving little political will to push through a comprehensive overhaul of the immigration system. Obama seems little concerned by Republican threats against making the immigration move, however, pointing out they had an opportunity to pass a bipartisan reform measure in the House but balked. ""I feel obliged to do everything I can lawfully with my executive authority to make sure that we don't keep on making the system worse,"" he said during last week's news conference.","Obama has pledged to act on immigration before the end of the year .

"(CNN) -- Last week, for the first time in decades, students from Wilcox County, Georgia, attended a school-sponsored prom that was open to all students rather than a private, racially segregated prom. For decades, Wilcox County High School hadn't hosted a prom for its 400 students. Instead, parents and their children organized private, off-site, racially segregated parties known to most as ""white prom"" and ""black prom."" After students planned their own integrated dance last year, school leaders announced they would sponsor the school's first prom -- and it would be open to everyone. ""Everything went off without a hitch,"" Wilcox County schools Superintendent Steve Smith said this week -- just as he expected. The last official school proms were held in Wilcox County decades ago, before schools were racially integrated, community members said. Wilcox County and many other schools in the Deep South canceled proms and homecoming dances in the early years of integration, and in some places, private, segregated proms became the local tradition. (The school has long hosted Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps balls, which were racially integrated and open to all JROTC members.) In 2013, a group of Wilcox County students organized an integrated prom open to white, black, Latino and Asian students. Organizers, both black and white, faced backlash from some community members who disliked the change -- or the crush of media attention it brought. The event made Wilcox County the butt of late-night TV jokes, but also drew thousands of supporters on social media, plus donated cash, dresses and DJ services. Wilcox County is not the only place with a history of racially segregated proms. In the 2009 documentary ""Prom Night in Mississippi,"" director Paul Saltzman followed the preparations for the first integrated prom in Charleston, Mississippi. Actor Morgan Freeman, a native of the area, offered in 1997 to cover the cost if the school board would hold an integrated prom, but the offer wasn't accepted till 2008. Last year, many community members said they'd support an integrated prom, or a school-sponsored prom -- it's just that old traditions are tough to change. Last year, it took a group of students, attention on social media and the support of the NAACP, parents and community members to make it happen. ""If we're all together and we love each other the way we say we do, then there are no issues,"" Wilcox County graduate Mareshia Rucker said last year after helping to organize the student-led integrated prom. ""This is something that should have happened a long time ago.""","The high school in Wilcox County, Georgia, held its first prom in late March .

"(CNN)An explosion at a mall in a suburb of the Australian city of Perth has killed two people and injured three others, authorities said Tuesday. The blast Tuesday morning at the Galleria mall in Morley sparked a fire that emergency crews put out. The cause of the explosion is under investigation, said Western Australia Police spokesman Adam Brauwer, declining to provide details. The Australia Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported that a power transformer was believed to have exploded. The broadcaster cited witnesses who saw men in flames running out of the building. ""I thought a car had exploded, petrol ... but it was a lot worse than that, it was the worst sight I had seen in my entire life,"" Harry Barugh told the ABC. Another witness, Jonathon McDonagh, said he initially thought the chaotic scene was a joke as he drove into the mall's parking lot. ""But then I saw the doorway they came running from and I knew straight away -- power station -- something had to have happened,"" he told the broadcaster. All the victims were men, police said.","Police are investigating a deadly blast at a mall in a Perth suburb .

"Anyone who's ever wanted to look, or dress like a princess will have the opportunity on Tuesday, when one of Princess Diana's most ""fairytale"" frocks goes under the hammer at Kerry Taylor Auction House in London. The princess was photographed many times while wearing the ball gown, which was the creation of David and Elizabeth Emanuel, Diana's favorite designers, and was inspired by Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. The dress -- a shimmering white organza number with gold sequins, crystals and pearl beads embedded throughout -- first caught her eye at a Red Cross benefit fashion show in 1986. The entire ensemble includes a petticoat, removable sleeve panels and a matching head band. Read more: Francis Bacon painting auctioned for more than $142 million, breaks record . ""This dress has a real 1980s, New Romantic style,"" says Kerry Taylor, the auction house owner. The Emanuels, she points out, were of particular significance to Diana, who used them to design both the black taffeta gown she wore for her first public appearance after the announcement of her engagement to Prince Charles, as well as the royal bridal gown for her marriage to the Prince in 1981. Diana also seemed very smitten with the ""Diaghilev"" dress, as she wore it to a number of public events, including during a state visit of Richard von Weizsaker, the then-President of the Federal Republic of Germany; to a performance at the Royal Opera House and for the premiere of the James Bond film ""The Living Daylights"". ""This dress was a real favorite of hers,"" says Taylor. ""It's the kind of dress that a little girl sitting down at school will draw when she's asked to draw a princess."" Diana would often forgo the headband, and instead pair the dress with a tiara, and she would wear the petticoat and sleeve panels interchangeably. ""She gave it lots of different looks and wore it with lots of different accessories,"" says Taylor. Read more: When street art meets runway style . The dress is expected to sell for $130,000 when it goes to auction. Taylor, who has sold other famous Diana garments, including the couture velvet gown she wore on her first official visit to the White House (where she famously two-stepped with John Travolta), says that the Princess' wardrobe tends to auction for anywhere between $50,000 and $500,000. ""The value depends on how beautiful they are, how historically important, if there's a story behind the dress, how often the Princess wore the dress, and if she was photographed in the dress. All these things add to its value,"" she says. Previously, the ""Diaghilev"" dress was owned by an American collector who used it as a means to raise funds for charity. Until recently, it had been on loan at Kensington Palace. Now, says Taylor, the collector wants to ""pass on the responsibility"". As for who is likely to bid on the piece on Tuesday, or why, Taylor says she has no idea. ""It's always a surprise. Most people only want one, so you rely on people to come out of the woodwork,"" she says. The reasons for buying a Diana dress are equally unexpected, she notes. ""The man who bought the John Travolta dress wanted to cheer up his wife. She had a nasty fall and hurt her leg, and he saw the dress and thought, 'this is just the thing.'""

"(CNN)The trip wasn't so grand for many guests on board Royal Caribbean's Grandeur of the Seas. The cruise line cut short a nine-day trip to Jamaica and elsewhere by one day after more than 200 people became ill with norovirus and a passenger experienced a medical emergency requiring medical attention on land. The ship returned to the Port of Baltimore on Monday. Gastrointestinal illness sickened 193 guests (9.91%) and nine crew members (1.15%), Royal Caribbean spokeswoman Cynthia Martinez told CNN affiliate WBAL. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control confirmed the ""causative agent"" of the widespread illness was norovirus. The CDC's Vessel Sanitation Program sent two environmental health officers and two epidemiologists to collect samples on board the ship in Falmouth, Jamaica, the federal agency said. The samples will be tested, and the ship's response to the outbreak will be evaluated. ""Once all guests had debarked Grandeur of the Seas, we began an extensive and thorough sanitizing onboard the ship and within the cruise terminal, to help prevent any illness from affecting the subsequent sailing,"" Martinez wrote in an email to CNN. ""All guests today will receive a letter at boarding that asks if they have experienced any gastrointestinal symptoms within the last three days,"" Martinez said. ""Similarly, if guests are uncomfortable taking their cruise, for reasons related to personal health or otherwise, our staff assisted them in rescheduling their sailing for another time. The ship will depart today, as scheduled."" Grandeur of the Seas had two norovirus outbreaks last year, according to the CDC's Vessel Sanitation Program website. Overall, the CDC reported nine total norovirus outbreaks in 2014 on cruise lines that docked in U.S. ports. Passengers complained about the cruise line not giving them enough information. ""It kind of seemed like they weren't being very honest with us about the whole situation. We heard that there were three people sick. Then another person said it was over 100, so, I mean, we never got a clear answer from any of the crew members,"" passenger Nick Canning told CNN affiliate WBAL. ""Some people were sick three days, vomiting, diarrhea, and they got shots and medication, and they said it was just a cruise from hell,"" passenger Georgia Moseback said. Passenger April Neall definitely didn't have the honeymoon of her dreams. ""I was happy to leave Baltimore and go to the islands, and now I'm just happy to be home,"" Neall said. Future cruisers should practice the same hygiene habits at sea that are wise to practice on land to stay healthy, Carolyn Spencer Brown, editor-in-chief of Cruise Critic, wrote in an email. ""Wash your hands frequently and take advantage of the hand-washing stations throughout the ship,"" she said. ""Prior to boarding, passengers go through a health screening aimed to help avoid the possibility of any pre-cruise illnesses being brought onboard -- it's important for cruisers to answer those questions truthfully to keep themselves, and others, healthy. Other than that, just know that passenger safety is the top priority for cruise lines, and cruise ship staff are well-equipped to prevent the spread of illness onboard as best as possible.""","Norovirus spread throughout Royal Caribbean passengers and crew .

"(CNN)The English Premier League (EPL) will gross over $8 billion from its latest domestic rights deal, with pay-TV broadcaster Sky  retaining the largest proportion of live televised matches, it was announced Tuesday. The deal for the three seasons from 2016 covers 168 live matches per season, with Sky to show 126 games, including Friday night matches for the first time. Rival BT Sport has been awarded the remaining packages. It represents a massive increase on the $4.59B paid by the same broadcasters to acquire the equivalent set of rights from 2013-16 and will make the EPL the second richest league in the world behind the National Football League (NFL) in the United States. Last week it was announced that the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) had paid $311 million to show highlights packages, while the lucrative overseas rights for the EPL have still to be assigned. Each succeeding rights auction since the EPL was launched in 1992 has seen large percentage increases and has directly benefited the financial position of the 20 clubs in English football's top-flight. The money is shared among the clubs with 50% of the amount divided equally, 25% awarded as a result of their finishing position in the league and the final quarter distributed to clubs depending on how many of its games are screened live on television. The broadcast deals have helped propel all 20 into the top 40 in the annual league of richest clubs worldwide compiled by Deloitte, a leading sports business analyst. Austin Houlihan, who specializes in rights deals for Deloitte, said there was no sign that the upward trend was going to end any time soon. ""With increases already achieved from domestic live and highlights rights deals and anticipated strong growth in overseas deals, the benefits of the new deals for Premier League clubs will be substantial,"" he told CNN. ""In 1991/92, the season before the inception of the Premier League, top-flight clubs generated less than £15m ($22.6m) in broadcast revenue.  In 2013/14, the first season of the current three-year cycle, the 20 top-flight clubs shared broadcast distributions totaling £1.5 billion ($2.26B).  The new round of deals from 2016/17, will deliver record amounts to clubs. ""With this latest round of Premier League deals we see no signs that the 'media rights bubble' is going to burst any time soon, as some have predicted regularly over the last 20 years,"" he added. Announcing the deal Tuesday, EPL chief executive Richard Scudamore said the clubs had delivered ""competitive and compelling football"" which had helped to increase viewing figures as well as live attendances. ""Both Sky Sports and BT Sport have done a tremendous job in bringing the game to the fans as well as providing the revenue that allows clubs to invest in football, facilities, youth development and their communities,"" he added. Sky, which is 39% owned by Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox organization, has a network of television channels but also provides Internet and telephone services. It has had to fight off the challenge of BT Sport, a subsidiary operation of BT Group plc, the British multinational telecommunications services company, to win the biggest rights packages on the last two auctions of EPL rights. Balotelli winner . Meanwhile, later Tuesday, some of the clubs set to benefit from the new riches were in action, with Mario Balotelli scoring the winner for Liverpool in their crucial 3-2 victory over Tottenham Hotspur. Harry Kane was among the scorers again as Tottenham twice came from behind to level, but lost out to the late strike from substitute Balotelli -- his first EPL goal. Arsenal edged bottom club Leicester 2-1 to move up to fourth, while QPR's 2-0 win at Sunderland took them out of the bottom three, with Aston Villa dropping into the relegation zone after going down 2-0 at Hull.","English Premier League seals new domestic TV deal .

"Russia showed no signs of backing down Monday even as world leaders threatened sanctions and sternly rebuked the country for sending troops into Ukraine. At an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting to discuss the unfolding crisis, Ukraine's envoy asked for help, saying that Russia had used planes, boats and helicopters to flood the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea with 16,000 troops in the past week. ""So far, Ukrainian armed forces have exercised restraint and refrained from active resistance to the aggression, but they are in full operational readiness,"" Ukrainian Ambassador Yuriy Sergeyev said. As diplomats at the meeting asked Russia to withdraw its troops and called for mediation to end the crisis, Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin insisted his country's aims were preserving democracy, protecting millions of Russians in Ukraine and stopping radical extremists. He said ousted President Viktor Yanukovych remains Ukraine's elected leader and has asked Russia to send troops. The Russian envoy read a letter from Yanukovych at the U.N. meeting, describing Ukraine as a country ""on the brink of civil war,"" plagued by ""chaos and anarchy."" ""People are being persecuted for language and political reasons,"" the letter said. ""So in this regard, I would call on the President of Russia, Mr. Putin, asking him to use the armed forces of the Russian Federation to establish legitimacy, peace, law and order, stability and defending the people of Ukraine."" U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power said Russia's claims about the situation in Ukraine are untrue and warned that sending military forces ""could be devastating."" Yanukovych, she said, abandoned his post last month and was then voted out of office by Ukraine's democratically elected parliament. ""Russian military action is not a human rights protection mission,"" Power said. ""It is a violation of international law."" Earlier Monday, global stocks slipped on fears things could get worse, and diplomats grasped for a way to stop the situation from escalating. British Foreign Secretary William Hague called the situation Europe's most serious crisis of the still-young 21st century. And U.S. President Barack Obama said the United States is examining a series of economic and diplomatic steps to ""isolate Russia,"" and he called on Congress to work with his administration on an economic assistance package for Ukraine. Tensions mount . In Crimea, more Russian troops arrived, surrounding military posts and other facilities and taking effective control of the peninsula from Ukrainian authorities. What they planned to do next remained unclear. Analysts told CNN the apparently growing presence of Russian troops in Crimea means there's a risk the tense standoff could escalate. ""There are lots of unintended consequences when you have armed men staring at each other in places like you do in Crimea,"" said Michael McFaul, the former U.S. Ambassador to Russia. ""So I think we all need to be very vigilant and worry about the worst case scenario, because it's no one's interest ... to see all out civil war in this country in the heart of Europe of 50 million people."" Putin's moves into Ukraine come as the Russian leader struggles to deal with a political crisis in the neighboring country that didn't unfold as his government hoped, according to Russia analyst Jill Dougherty, formerly CNN's Moscow bureau chief. ""Putin has been trying to figure out what to do. So now he's taking these steps,"" Dougherty said. ""And I think that he probably thinks that they're carefully calibrated. But he really is playing with fire."" In one ominous incident, a Ukrainian Defense Ministry spokesman said the commander of Russia's Black Sea fleet boarded a blocked Ukrainian warship and issued a threat. ""Swear allegiance to the new Crimean authorities, or surrender, or face an attack,"" he said, according to the spokesman, Vladislav Seleznyov. But a spokesman for the Russian Black Sea Fleet said there are no plans to storm Ukrainian military units in Crimea, according to the state-run Interfax news agency. And one Crimean official has reportedly described the situation there as quiet. Despite the assurances, stocks fell around the world, with Russian stocks leading the way as investors parsed the day's developments. Markets declined in Asia, Europe and the United States, where the benchmark Dow Jones fell 153 points Monday. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Monday that sanctions against Russia weren't just possible, but likely. Ukraine's shaky new government has mobilized troops and called up military reservists. In Kiev, interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk, who has accused Moscow of declaring war, vowed that his West-leaning government would not give up the region. ""Nobody will give Crimea away. ... There are no grounds for the use of force against civilians and Ukrainians, and for the entry of the Russian military contingent,"" he said. ""Russia never had any grounds and never will."" A strange scene: Somewhat polite standoff in Crimea . If judged by the numbers, Ukraine's military loses war with Russia . Worried West . The tensions have worried the West, and Russia's G8 partners have condemned Moscow's military buildup in Crimea. The world's seven major industrialized powers also suspended preparations for the G8 summit in Sochi, Russia, in June. Their finance ministers announced some economic support for cash-strapped Ukraine. ""We are also committed to mobilize rapid technical assistance to support Ukraine in addressing its macroeconomic, regulatory, and anti-corruption challenges,"" the finance ministers said in a written statement. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, due in Kiev Tuesday, said several foreign powers are looking at economic consequences if Russia does not withdraw its forces. The United States has suspended upcoming trade and investment talks with Russia due to the events in Ukraine, a spokesman for the U.S. trade representative said Monday. Obama said Monday that Russia should consider international condemnation of its military moves in Ukraine, adding that ""over time, this will be a costly proposition"" due to sanctions and isolation that will result if the situation continues or worsens. Kerry will offer Ukraine a ""specific"" package of U.S. economic aid when he travels to Kiev for talks Tuesday, Obama said. German Chancellor Angela Merkel's office said Putin had accepted a proposal to establish a ""fact-finding mission"" to Ukraine, possibly under the leadership of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and to start a political dialogue. How is the rest of the world reacting? East vs. West . Ukraine, a nation of 45 million people sandwiched between Europe and Russia's southwestern border, has been in chaos since Yanukovych was ousted on February 22 after bloody street protests that left dozens dead and hundreds wounded. Anti-government demonstrations started in late November, when Yanukovych spurned a deal with the EU, favoring closer ties with Moscow instead. Ukraine has faced a deepening split, with those in the west generally supporting the interim government and its European Union tilt, while many in the east prefer a Ukraine where Russia casts a long shadow. Nowhere is that feeling more intense than in Crimea, the last big bastion of opposition to the new political leadership. Ukraine suspects Russia of fomenting tension in the autonomous region that might escalate into a bid for separation by its Russian majority. Ukrainian leaders and commentators have compared events in Crimea to what happened in Georgia in 2008. Then, cross-border tensions with Russia exploded into a five-day conflict that saw Russian tanks and troops pour into the breakaway territories of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, as well as Georgian cities. Russia and Georgia each blamed the other for starting the conflict. Moscow has defended its parliament's approval of Putin's use of military force to protect its citizens in the Crimean Peninsula, an autonomous region of eastern Ukraine with strong loyalty to Russia. But Ukraine's ambassador to the U.N. says Russia's reasoning for a possible invasion is fake. ""There is no evidence that the Russian ethnic population or Russian-speaking population is under threat,"" Sergeyev told CNN. The Russian parliament, or Duma, is also considering a law that would allow for the annexation of Crimea, according to the parliament's website. ""Now they are trying to create new legal basis to prove annexation of the territory they're now occupying,"" Sergeyev said.

"(CNN) -- It's December 1991 and France is on the verge of making tennis history. The scene is set for Guy Forget to lead the nation to Davis Cup victory for the first time in 59 years. Standing in his way is a U.S. team defending its title -- and more specifically, Pete Sampras. Some 40 games and many more points later, the Frenchman produces an irresistible serve-and-volley combination that leaves his young opponent -- who would later become one of the greatest tennis players -- failing desperately to return. The home crowd in the Gerland Sports Palace in Lyon erupts; Forget falls to his feet. Six decades of waiting is finally over. With a crocodile logo sitting atop of his pounding heart, the match-winner was lofted onto his teammates' shoulders with tears in his eyes, bursting with pride, taking in this historic moment. If Forget was emotional, so too was an 87-year-old man who had helped France to its first Davis Cup success back in 1927 -- also against the United States -- and had now finally seen the famous trophy return to his homeland. The pride for that man, Rene Lacoste, was twofold. Not only had he played a role in Forget's development, he was also responsible for that distinctive reptile perching on the chest of the history-maker's shirt. ""I remember all the letters we got and all the phone calls (from Lacoste) when we won the Davis Cup in 1991,"" Forget told CNN's Open Court. ""Beating the United States was very special for us, but for Rene as well."" So tenacious was Lacoste's style of play on court, building his game from the baseline and keeping his opponents on the move with an array of precise groundstrokes, he earned the nickname ""Le Crocodile"" -- the symbol that would later define his fashion empire. ""He fought like a real crocodile ... and never gave up on his prey,"" American journalist George Carens wrote in 1923. Forget adds: ""One of his traits on the court was that he'd never give up, he'd return every ball back. He was unbeatable and that's how that name came. It's great to identify someone with an animal."" Lacoste's major breakthrough came in 1925, when he won the French Open at the age of 20, before adding the Wimbledon title a month later. Within just four years, he had claimed a total of seven major singles championships on top of three doubles titles, while he was ranked No. 1 in the world in both 1926 and 1927. Lacoste was also a member of two Davis Cup-winning teams in an era when the competition took on the same prestige as a modern-day soccer World Cup. Between the two world wars, France dominated tennis. With compatriots Jacques Brugnon, Jean Borotra, and Henri Cochet, Lacoste helped make up the ""Four Musketeers"" -- a group of national icons idolized in their homeland. ""He was very inspirational, not only to me but to a lot of French players,"" Forget says of Lacoste. So inspirational were the efforts of Lacoste and his peers to their people that the Stade Roland Garros was built specially in Paris to host France's maiden defense of the Davis Cup in 1928. Each of the stadium's four main spectator grandstands were named after one of the quartet, while the winner of today's French Open men's singles championship is still presented with the ""Coupe des Mousquetaires"" trophy. ""We built Roland Garros for them, they were the reason the stadium was built, so it shows that at that time they were huge stars,"" French tennis journalist Philippe Bouin told CNN. ""Maybe because they were the first French team to have success."" Yet as sport has a cruel way of doing so, a career with its best years still lying ahead, and one that still offered so much more promise, was soon brought to an abrupt end. In 1929, and at the age of just 24, Lacoste was forced to hang up his racket due to a respiratory disease. The Parisian would have been forgiven for walking away from the game at this point, but his unrelenting passion for tennis, and perhaps the heartache suffered from his premature retirement, drove him on to leave a more far-reaching legacy than just a collection of trophies. ""He said, 'Tennis couldn't be the future for me, I have to do other things, I have to work.' In fact for him it wasn't work, it was amusement,"" former France Davis Cup captain Jean-Paul Loth told CNN. An innovator during his playing days, Lacoste had covered the handles of his rackets with surgical tape to make them easier to use, while also designing and creating a tennis ball-pitching machine to help him train. As of 1930, post-retirement, he started mass-producing his invention for the benefit of others, and the ""Lacoste Machine"" would soon play a part in training players for generations to come. ""He was all these different persons at once,"" Forget says. ""He was an engineer, he was a great champion, he was a visionary man, he always had ways of talking about the future, whether it was rackets, balls, materials, the game."" And materials would become Lacoste's next pet project. Fed up with the heavy, long-sleeved shirts that had long been part of the tennis player's attire, he designed a more practical, cotton version, with revolutionary short sleeves. Joining forces with Andre Gillier, the founder of one of the oldest and biggest hosiery businesses in Troyes, in 1933 he launched the state-of-the-art polo shirt, complete with a crocodile logo embroidered on it, and so the ""Lacoste"" brand was born. He had been sporting the reptile on his tennis whites since a friend, Robert George, designed the logo for him the previous decade. ""He wanted to find something that was lighter, more comfortable, that you could breathe more freely with it, that's what he did with the shirt,"" Forget says. ""He was always trying to find new ways of improving everything. ""As long as it worked he didn't care about breaking the boundaries of what was conventional."" The polo shirt proved a hit, and with it the ""Lacoste"" brand, as subsequent generations of leading players all donned the cotton number on court. He formed a fashion house with his wife Simone, who like their daughter Catherine was a top amateur golfer -- another sport into which the Lacoste logo spread. Aged 57, Lacoste was still refusing to rest on his laurels, and had another trick up his sleeve. In 1961, he unveiled the metal tennis racket -- an idea he had been working on for 30 years. By using metal instead of wood, the racket would be more resilient, and just as importantly, the ball could be hit with far more power. Pierre Darmon, France's No. 1 player at the time, agreed to try out the racket and debuted it at Wimbledon in 1963. By 1978, the T2000, as it was known, had helped win 46 grand slam titles and was used by some of the most famous names in the world, including Jimmy Connors and Billie Jean King. But Lacoste wasn't just an inventor extraordinaire. Having been a tennis player, too, he took time out to show a great interest in those who handled his creations. ""Rene always had a gentle look on the players who were using his rackets or wearing the shirts,"" Forget said. ""He'd always give you advice and invite you to his house, if he had an idea like a tennis racket."" Lacoste's next brainchild was the ""Equijet."" A racket using the latest in cutting-edge technology, it combined the advantages of small and large beams, while looking rather like a violin or guitar. He introduced it to the up-and-coming Forget in 1988, and it would play no small part in his future successes. ""He was always trying to find new ways of improving the game and having the edge on other players, especially the French players being able to use them,"" Forget says. In many ways, that historic evening in Lyon could be seen as the culmination of his life's work. Lacoste died in 1996, aged 92, having struggled with health problems -- and France won the Davis Cup again. ""He would have been proud of what became of tennis in France, because tennis has grown in the last 50 years,"" Bouin says. This weekend the French team will seek to reach the Davis Cup final for the first time since losing the 2010 title match, taking on two-time defending champion the Czech Republic at Roland Garros. The current crop of players, led by Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Gael Monfils and Richard Gasquet, are known as ""The New Musketeers"" -- though they have a long way to go to match the exploits of ""Le Crocodile."" They might not all wear his clothes, but the legacy lives on.","Rene Lacoste has left a lasting legacy in tennis and fashion .

"(CNN)Distraction caused by taking selfies is likely to blame for a plane crash that killed a pilot and his passenger in Colorado in May, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. Investigators found an undamaged GoPro video camera near the wreckage and recovered its data card. Video from the card showed the 29-year-old pilot with several passengers on flights the previous day, and one nighttime flight shortly before the fatal trip, taking photos of himself with his cell phone, according to investigators. ""The camera's flash was activated and illuminated the cockpit area,"" the report said. The fatal flight, on May 31, was not captured on the GoPro footage but investigators said that the pilot, who is not identified in the report, was at the controls of the plane when it stalled and crashed in a wheat field, bounced once and came to rest upright. It's likely that the use of cell phones during that flight ""distracted the pilot,"" the report said, causing him to develop spatial disorientation and lose control of the plane. The aircraft went into a stall and then spun before crashing, investigators said. Investigators found nothing wrong with the aircraft itself that might have contributed to the crash, the NTSB said. The 29-year-old pilot had a total of 726 total fight hours and 27 hours of experience flying at night. His logbooks did not show that he had training in instruments to deal with a stall or that he was qualified to fly at night with passengers, the NTSB said. Family members said that Amritpal Singh was flying the plane, the Denver Post reported. It was registered to him. Singh's relatives told the newspaper that the passenger was a musician in town for a concert.","Investigators found GoPro camera near crash site .

"(CNN)His broken bones include both wrists, collarbones, shoulder blades, cheekbones and every single one of his ribs, as well as a leg, arm and ankle not to mention the punctured lungs. Most of his teeth are replacements having been knocked out in the line of duty. Has there ever been a sports person as dominant as jockey AP McCoy? His achievements dwarf those of seven-time Formula One world champion Michael Schumacher. His success arguably surpasses that of Tiger Woods in his major-winning pomp. Woods is one of McCoy's idols -- the pair are pictured together in his Twitter avatar -- and they played together in a Pro-Am in 2010. In the aftermath, it was Woods that was left waxing lyrical about his playing partner, astounded that McCoy was still standing after his litany of injuries. But one of the greatest sporting legacies of all-time will draw to a close at the end of April, when McCoy officially retires. The 40-year-old, who announced his shock decision at Newbury Racecourse last weekend, looks set to climb out of the saddle with a 20th consecutive British Jump Jockeys Championship. One more triumph will mean he has taken the crown every year since he first turned professional. His dominance is hardly surprising when you consider his is now well past 4,300 career victories. Has anyone greater ever sat in the saddle? British jockey Sir Gordon Richards managed 4,870 winners but those were in the world of flat racing where falls are notoriously fewer and farther between. The Northern Irishman estimates he has fallen over 1,000 times and he is well known in the Emergency Department of a host of hospitals in Great Britain and Ireland. For all those knocks, he has ridden on regardless until announcing his decision live on British television: ""I want to go while I'm still enjoying racing and while I am still near the top. This is without doubt the hardest decision I've ever had to make. I've been dreading this day. ""To become a jockey was the best decision I've ever made and I will really miss it. This is something I've been very luck to have as a great way of life for the last 25 years. But time waits for no man in sport and it's not going to wait for me."" His rivals will no doubt breathe a collective sigh of relief at his impending retirement. Former jockey-turned-trainer Jamie Osborne tweeted his former rival after the news: ""Hated riding with u. Tried to dislike u but couldn't. Too dedicated. Too strong. Too talented."" Fellow jump jockey Ruby Walsh joked that McCoy is ""made of concrete"" such was the manner in which he was able to bounce back from falls that would have written off lesser mortals to ride his next winner moments later. And trainer Martin Pipe labeled him ""the iron man."" It may be a career history awash with big wins from the notorious Grand National, the world's most famous jump jockey race, in 2010, to two victories in the Cheltenham Gold Cup, the main event of the annual Cheltenham Festival, often referred to as the Olympics of the horse-racing world. But the injuries aside, it has come with other difficulties. At 1.78 meters, McCoy is tall for a jockey and in order to keep his weight down, has spent the past two decades and more competing at 65kg when his natural weight is closer to 76kg. As a result, he treats himself to just two steaks a year as part of a meager diet along with routine saunas and scolding hot baths. A teetotaler, he claims to have touched neither drink nor drugs in his life, instead adamant that racing is his drug. Amid all that, he has shone in the sport with a career win record of 24% -- most top jockeys struggle to get in the high teens -- and in the region of 30% this season to date. It is no wonder his fellow riders simply call him ""Champ."" News of his impending retirement came after riding his 200th winner of the season -- Mr Mole at Newbury -- for the ninth time in his career. In typically understated fanfare, there was no press conference, he had not even told his parents. The only ones that knew were the bookmaker JP McManus, who has McCoy riding his horses on a retainer of $1.5 million a year, his agent Dave Roberts and his wife Chanelle. And he had only told her just five days before his public announcement. It is 23 years since he rode his first winner as a 17-year-old in Ireland before competing for the first time in England in 1994. There is just one regret, that he never rode 300 winners in a season -- his best being 289 in the 2000-01 season, in itself a record. That triple century had initially looked on the cards last season only for injury to peg him back: ""I thought I could ride 300 winners and the fact it was taken away from me broke my heart."" On the impending retirement, he added: ""It is emotional because I am retiring from something I really like doing. That is why it is tough but it's the right thing."" So what lies in store in the future? For now, he says he has no idea but much like former jockey Dick Francis did, he has also put pen to paper on a first novel. ""Taking the Fall,"" came out last year with jockey Duncan Claymore in the starring role. A second, ""Narrowing the Field,"" is due for publication in October so expect more works of fiction. So remarkable have McCoy's achievements been and so massively have they surpassed those of any of his predecessors or peers, one would have previously thought them a work of fiction.","British jump jockey AP McCoy calls time on his illustrious career .

"Richard Ben Cramer, the Pulitzer Prize-winning writer whose 1992 book ""What It Takes"" remains one of the most detailed and passionate of all presidential campaign chronicles, died Monday night, according to his longtime agent, Philippa ""Flip"" Brophy. He was 62. The cause of death was lung cancer. Cramer's work -- and work ethic -- was legendary among reporters. He talked in firm, declamatory bursts in a growl of a voice tinged with cigars and alcohol. He was generous with other writers, dogged in his pursuit of information, and known for idiosyncratically ""doing things in his own way, on his own schedule,"" recalled Brophy. ""He was stubborn, charming and the most brilliant person I knew -- and the warmest,"" she said. ""He was an unmatched talent who set an enormously high bar for political journalism. I will miss him,"" said Vice President Joe Biden in a statement.  Biden and Cramer became friendly when the author was working on ""What It Takes."" CNN senior political analyst Gloria Borger, echoing many, attests to his generosity. She was a cub reporter for the old Washington Star when she was assigned to the Maryland statehouse beat. Cramer, then with The (Baltimore) Sun, took her under his wing. ""I was this new kid on the block, and he'd been around and knew Maryland politics very well, and he was smart and a brilliant writer -- and kind to a new reporter on the beat,"" she said. Cramer put all his fury, emotion and eye for detail on the page in such works as ""Joe DiMaggio: A Hero's Life"" (2000), ""How Israel Lost"" (2004) and especially ""What It Takes,"" a 1,047-page account of the 1988 presidential race. ""What It Takes"" reads like Tom Wolfe on speed, like Theodore H. White left out in the wild. It's fueled by Cramer's determination to find out just exactly why people are crazy enough to run the obstacle course in pursuit of the nation's highest office. The book contains astute and sympathetic profiles of George H.W. Bush, Michael Dukakis, Joe Biden and particularly Bob Dole. The latter comes across as particularly rich, with his distinctive third-person speaking style and tossed-off ""Aghs,"" all rendered with Cramer's painterly eye. ""Too much political journalism today, even in book form, is geared more toward staff feuds and soap opera and less to what Richard spent so much time in 1988 exploring: what makes these candidates tick, and what drives them to compete in such an arduous -- and yes, at times, ridiculous process,"" said CNN's chief national correspondent, John King, who covered the Dukakis campaign that year. Cramer plunged into the day-to-day drudgery of a presidential campaign with a vengeance, and what emerges is half winged exultation, half death march. (Indeed, the strain of doing the book made him very ill, though reports that it nearly killed him were ""exaggerations,"" said Brophy.) In the long history of campaign works, which includes White's ""Making of the President"" series, Hunter S. Thompson's ""Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72"" and John Heilemann and Mark Helperin's gossipy ""Game Change,"" Cramer's tome looms large -- ""one of the most important books on American politics in the 20th century,"" said Michael Pakenham, a former editor at the Philadelphia Inquirer and a Cramer colleague. The book was hugely influential. ""Richard Ben Cramer transformed a whole generation of political reporters with his sweeping chronicle of the 1988 campaign,"" said Howard Kurtz, host of CNN's ""Reliable Sources"" and Washington bureau chief for The Daily Beast. ""While almost no one could write and report as he did, he set the bar higher for everyone."" Cramer was fascinated as much by the machinery that produced power and hero worship as he was by the people at their center. ""He was a journalist who listened and watched particularly well,"" says Butch Ward, a senior faculty member at the Poynter Institute and another former Inquirer colleague. ""He went places most of us aspired to, but he got there."" Such determination didn't often sit well with reviewers. ""What It Takes"" was criticized as self-indulgent; ""How Israel Lost,"" which painted a bleak picture of Cramer's former Mideast stomping grounds, was knocked as simple-minded. And Cramer's warts-and-all DiMaggio biography, though a bestseller, was slammed for the author's blunt handling of the New York Yankee hero. Cramer ""relentlessly, pulverizingly tells us that the man wasn't worthy of the legend built up around him,"" Allen Barra wrote in Salon. The review was headlined ""Joe Cruel."" Cramer, of course, didn't see it that way. ""I think among older fans there's a sense that I'm somehow messing with their own memories, which was never my intent,"" he told CNN at the time. ""I can understand their annoyance. But to me the life of DiMaggio was always more interesting than the myth."" Cramer was born in Rochester, New York, in 1950, and studied at Johns Hopkins and Columbia's journalism school. He worked at The Sun in the 1970s and then at the Philadelphia Inquirer from 1977 to 1984. He won a Pulitzer Prize for his Middle East reporting in 1979. As a freelance writer, he wrote a number of well-received profiles, including a Rolling Stone piece on Jerry Lee Lewis, an Esquire cover story on Baltimore mayor (and later Maryland governor) William Donald Schaefer, and a much-talked-about story on Ted Williams, later reprinted as the book ""What Do You Think of Ted Williams Now?"" Despite his renown among journalists, he wasn't always an easy sell, recalls Brophy. After she signed him -- ""intercepting"" him from agency head Sterling Lord because she loved his newspaper and magazine work -- she spent years funneling him book ideas from interested publishers. ""He'd say, 'No, no, no, no, no,' and I would say (to others), 'He's really the type of person who needs to come up with his own idea.' "" When he finally had his own idea, it was for ""What It Takes,"" a mammoth undertaking that frightened publishers. ""I said, 'Richard, that's a great book idea, but it's not a first book. It's like a 10th book.' And he went, 'Sell it,' "" said Brophy. ""And I did."" With just four books and a handful of magazine articles over his long post-newspaper career, Cramer operated on his own clock. Sometimes that meant literally, said Brophy. One morning, while researching ""What It Takes,"" he called her at 7:30, saying that he had missed a 7:15 flight. ""What time did you get there?"" she asked. ""7:20,"" he replied.

"(CNN)When Jeff Varasano moved from his native New York City to Atlanta he encountered a problem -- the local pizza was not up to scratch. Having grown up watching his grandmother make tasty, thin-dough wonders in the oven of her Bronx apartment, Varasano was accustomed to a high standard of this universally-loved delicacy. So, in spite of being a software engineer rather than a cook, he set out to create his own, mouth-watering pizza. ""I did a lot of crazy things to make a great pizza at home,"" Varasano says. ""I've tried over 100 flours, 100 olive oils, 100 tomatoes. I've sampled 51 different oreganos,"" he explains. One of the tactics he used was wrapping his oven in aluminum foil in order to get the temperature extra high, and it took him six years and two kitchen fires to perfect his recipe. ""I've been a tinkerer since I was a little kid,"" says Varasano, ""I've always liked to experiment with things, I viewed it as a puzzle."" Engineering quality . When he was finally happy with his home-grown formula Varasano posted the recipe online. It went viral and he opened his own pizzeria in Atlanta in 2009. The New Yorker is very particular about his product -- he grows his own oregano and uses natural sourdough which is aged for three days for a rich flavour. ""The style I like is not quite Neapolitan, not quite New York. Sort of a hybrid in the middle, but the crust is very, very light,"" he says. Varasano says he was passionate about software engineering, his original profession, but it lacked the immediacy of impact that a mouthful of great-tasting tasting pizza has. ""My software was very complicated, so it was very difficult to explain to people,"" he says. ""Pizza is the exact opposite. You take one bite and in five seconds you're excited about it.""","New Yorker Jeff Varasano struggled to find pizza that he liked when he moved to Atlanta .

"Twitter will withhold content from a neo-Nazi account at the request of German authorities, the first time it has put into action a policy of local censorship it adopted in January and a step that will probably reignite debate over freedom of expression on the Internet. Alex Macgillivray, Twitter's general counsel, tweeted the company's decision Thursday: ""We announced the ability to withhold content back in Jan. We're using it now for the first time re: a group deemed illegal in Germany."" Big Brother still watching: Internet censorship on the up . But although Twitter, hailed by many as a powerful enabler of free speech, is taking its first step toward limiting hate speech, some groups say it still has a long way to go. The Anti-Defamation League has said it ""lags far behind"" other social media networks in setting clear standards over racism. A barrage of anti-Semitic abuse prompted by a series of hashtags in France has highlighted the problem there in recent weeks, with the French Union of Jewish Students adding its voice to the concerns raised by the ADL. ""When free expression crosses the line into speech that society recognizes as an affront to individuals' human dignity and as thinly veiled calls for violence, then the service provider has a responsibility to establish acceptable boundaries,"" ADL national director Abraham Foxman said. ""It is time for Twitter to set some boundaries."" Incitement against people, particularly for racial reasons, and advocating the overthrow of democracy became illegal in Germany after the fall of the Nazi dictatorship.  Authorities there strictly enforce anti-propaganda measures handed down against hate groups. The neo-Nazi club Better Hannover used its website for racist and anti-democratic propaganda. The site has disappeared from the Internet, but the group's Twitter feed is still visible in the United States. In its role of enforcing the ban on the group, police in Hannover, Germany, sent a fax in late September to Twitter's headquarters in San Francisco announcing that the group's ""accounts in social networks have to be closed immediately."" Twitter's response falls short of the German demand. In another tweet, Macgillivray indicated that Twitter would selectively deal with the feed: ""Never want to withhold content; good to have tools to do it narrowly and transparently."" The tweet includes a link to a support page explaining how Twitter can withhold content from view in specific countries. Police who carried out raids on Better Hannover confiscated computers, far-right paraphernalia and weapons, the Interior Ministry for Lower Saxony state said in a statement on September 25. The group, which had been known about since 2008, was ""dissolved with immediate effect. Any activity or the building of a substitute group is not allowed,"" it said. The extremist group's Twitter feed includes links to another far-right group's website. It stops abruptly on September 25, the day of the police raids. Lower Saxony Interior Minister Uwe Schuenemann told CNN by e-mail Thursday that he welcomed the swift reaction by Twitter and other Internet companies. ""This is a very important step. For far-right extremists especially, the Internet has become more important as a communications and recruiting platform. There is only one goal during the fight against far-right extremism, and that is to undermine and stop the spreading of this inhuman ideology."" Dirk Hensen, a spokesman for Twitter Germany, stressed the company's transparency over its action. Kirsty Hughes, chief executive of Index on Censorship, a London-based group that promotes free expression, said that what is key is who is making the decision about censoring content. Twitter's action came in response to a request from Germany based on its laws barring hate speech, rather than being driven by the company itself, she points out. Where Twitter and other websites face a difficult balancing act is where countries' laws overstep the boundaries of free expression, she said. ""Different countries have different laws about hate speech. We, as a freedom-of-expression group, would say 'put restrictions on speech where there is a clear and direct incitement to violence.' Otherwise, we would always argue for fairly limited controls,"" she said. Twitter's move will probably feed into a wider debate in the digital world about the ""privatization of censorship,"" Hughes said. ""There's a big issue about what do we want Web hosting companies and Internet service providers to do,"" she said. ""We don't ask telephone companies to censor what you, or I or anyone else is saying on the phone. ""If we were to ask or even pass regulation saying all these Web hosting services had to vet and moderate everything on their site, when there are billions of things on the site, it would completely close down the ability of the Internet to operate as it does, as a wonderful place for free expression and swapping of ideas."" On the other hand, if companies such as Twitter respond instead to government requests or court orders over specific content, ""that's a way of managing it without putting a complete chill on the whole Internet."" As an example of the challenges Internet companies face, Hughes points to Google's recent troubles in Brazil, where the company's top executive was arrested  for not taking down online videos that government officials said violated the South American country's election law.","Lower Saxony minister: The move is ""a very important step"" against extremism .

"The world's largest flying aquatic insect, with huge, nightmarish pincers, has been discovered in China's Sichuan province, experts say. According to the Insect Museum of West China, local villagers in the outskirts of Chengdu handed over ""weird insects that resemble giant dragonflies with long teeth"" earlier this month. Several of these odd critters were examined by the museum and found to be unusually large specimens of the giant dobsonfly, which is native to China and Vietnam. The largest one measured 21 centimeters (8.27 inches) when its wings were open, according to the museum, busting the original record for largest aquatic insect held by a South American helicopter damselfly, which had a wingspan of 19.1 centimeters (7.5 inches). Large enough to cover the face of a human adult, this scary-looking insect is also known among entomologists as an indicator of water quality, says the museum. The giant dobsonfly makes its home in bodies of clean water and is highly sensitive to any changes in the water's pH as well as the presence of trace elements of pollutants. If the water is slightly contaminated, the giant dobsonfly will move on to seek cleaner waters. The insect can be found in other provinces in China, India's Assam state, and in northern Vietnam. This is the first time it has appeared in Sichuan province. MORE: Asian giant hornets and other terrifying creatures . MORE: Deadly giant hornets kill 42 people in China .

"(CNN)Picture yourself with members of your extended family, coming together to celebrate a birthday, when one of your family members disciplines your child by slapping him or her in the face. I'm pretty sure if that happened in my household, it would be a race between my husband and me to see who could get to that family member first and tell them in no uncertain terms exactly how much we didn't appreciate what they did. The idea of disciplining another person's child is certainly a provocative question in the modern world of parenting, where we tend to take every parenting decision way more seriously than our typically much more laid-back parents did in the '60s and '70s. The concept is also the storyline for a NBC series premiering next week called ""The Slap,"" based on an Australian novel and television program by the same name. Though the series looks compelling, the whole notion of slapping or hitting another person's child tends to depend on whether you support physical discipline yourself, based on my very unscientific sampling of opinions from mothers and fathers across the country and in my social networks. ""I would not spank my children,"" said Janeane Davis, a mother of four and founder of the blog Janeane's World. ""I do not spank my children. I do not think someone else should."" The cultural, generational and regional roots of spanking . Jennifer Bosse, a mother of two and freelance writer who blogs at Defining My Happy, says she would never spank nor ever allow another parent to spank her child as a form of discipline, ""regardless of circumstances."" But Laura Beyer, a mom of two grown children, says she has ""spanked, given time-outs, whatever it has taken to regain control of the situation."" Take physical discipline off the table, and you get more agreement than disagreement from parents that disciplining other people's kids is not just OK; sometimes, it's a necessity. David Le Roy, a father of two boys and owner of a technology firm in Chicago, says he's had to do it pretty often. ""A stern talking-to is as far as I would go unless the child was about to either harm themselves or someone else,"" said Le Roy, who created a Facebook group for African-American fathers in 2013. He talked about times when his friends were over and their kids were ""buck wild."" He had to raise his voice, give them stern warnings and inform the parent of their child's behavior, he said. Kids behaving badly: When old rules of discipline no longer apply . ""Some (parents) received it well and got off the couch and did something. One parent told me that this is how their daughter expresses themselves and that she is eccentric. Not in my house, LOL,"" Le Roy wrote in an email. It can get messy, though, especially when other parents take issue with you doling out the discipline to their kids. Beyer remembers the time she was dating someone with an ""out of control 'Jerry Springer-type' of 9-year-old"" who would ""kick, hit, punch and outright disrespect her father."" The first time she had to step in, she told the girl she would take her cell phone away and put it in her room. The relationship couldn't quite weather the strain of the daughter's behavior and the discipline she felt she needed to administer, said Beyer, of West Allis, Wisconsin. Brutally Honest: What if you don't like your kids' friends? ""It caused a lot of dissension between us and led to an eventual breakup because he outright refused to take responsibility for her upbringing, always stating it was her mother's fault regarding her behaviors,"" she added. Tracey Koch of Lewiston, Idaho, said her husband once took a toy from a little boy who was using it to hurt other kids at their house, and the little boy's mother didn't talk to her for a while, although she never mentioned the incident. ""I think it bothers people to have someone else punish their child. However, they don't want to necessarily admit it,"" said the mom of two and nurse practitioner. Add me to the group of parents who doesn't want to admit that it rubs me the wrong way if and when someone else tries to discipline my child. I know it shouldn't, but for some reason, it does. Ego is part of it, no doubt. Rhonda Woods, a mom of three, believes that if you are going to discipline someone else's child, the circumstances need to be considered, and the discipline has to be defined. Brutally Honest: Mean girls are getting younger . When her children have friends over, under her supervision, she treats and disciplines them the way she would if they were her own kids. ""I tell all of my kids' friends, 'When you are at my house, you are my kid,' "" said Woods, a real estate agent in New Milford, Connecticut. When there is an issue, she will inform the kids of any infraction, explain why it was wrong and help them problem-solve to figure out ways not to do it in the future. ""I will admit that this isn't always done with an even level tone to my voice."" What gets perhaps the most dicey, many parents say, is when you are in a public setting and you are faced with whether to discipline the child of someone you don't know. Bosse, the mom of two young boys, finds this the most difficult situation to assess by far. There was a time, she said, when another child continuously bullied one of her boys. Brutally Honest: When is to OK to leave your teen home alone overnight? ""After watching and waiting for the other parent to step in, I finally had to walk over there and tell the child it was not okay,"" Bosse said. ""I was very frustrated by that situation, because I didn't feel like it was my place to step in and speak to the child, but at the same time, I couldn't allow my child to be bullied that way."" Davis, of Janeane's World, said that if a child needed to be disciplined in a public setting, she would say something to the parent quietly so the child could not hear it. ""I would not discipline another person's child if the parent was present,"" she added. ""If the parent chose not to or could not discipline her child, I would remove myself and my family from that situation."" Woods has said things to children who are misbehaving in public, even if their parents are right there. ""I firmly believe it takes a community. Most people are willing to stand by and judge and not help."" Do you think it's OK to discipline another person's child?

"(CNN)In the midst of a disheartening outbreak of measles and assorted other diseases we thought had been wiped out, comes another outbreak that has just gotten started: a GOP pander war. And those parents who have apparently decided it is in their childrens' interests to forego vaccines are now smack in the middle of it, and with good reason: Outbreaks of the measles and whooping cough are back, endangering the youngest populations everywhere. But somehow a clear issue of public health has morphed into a political debate over liberty, personal freedom and individual choice. We all understand the past debates over a possible link (now thoroughly disproven) between vaccinations and autism, and no one can challenge parents' rights to try to protect their children. But the science is now clear: vaccinations are necessary. What's murky is the politics. The growing anti-government animus in the country and a complete lack of trust in institutions has somehow devolved into paranoia -- that the big government-elite-corporate ideological agenda is driving the push for vaccinations. Whether it's the skeptical left or the skeptical right, it comes down to the same theory of everything: a deep-seated mistrust in institutions and an unwillingness to defer to them. So maybe it should come as no surprise that libertarian Sen. Rand Paul, while pointing out he's not ""anti-vaccine,"" called it a ""personal decision."" Or that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, looking to burnish his conservative credentials, allowed that parents ""need to have some measure of choice"" about vaccinating their kids (although he later tried to soften that statement by adding there's ""no question"" kids should be vaccinated against measles). Is this the same Christie who, going against the advice of experts, required a mandatory quarantine of a woman returning from Africa who had been fighting Ebola to keep the public healthy? Hard to square that circle. In many ways, says Bill Galston, who was domestic policy adviser to former President Bill Clinton, ""vaccines have become the black helicopter of medicine. People think that those in positions of institutional authority are either self-aggrandizing or possessed of some ideological mission."" That's precisely why it's so difficult to lead in this country right now. And precisely why the country is in such need of real leaders -- maybe even someone who comes out and says there oughta be a law. Even President Barack Obama's spokesman says the President ""believes it shouldn't require a law for people to exercise common sense and do the right thing."" Maybe it shouldn't, but when children who visit Disneyland are getting sick, something is very wrong. Maybe that's why conservative pediatric neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson is for mandatory vaccines. Or why Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin is rethinking a mandate, as he told CNN's Dana Bash. ""I've pulled up short of a federal mandate ... but I am really distressed by some of these comments of wannabe presidential candidates...,"" says Durbin. ""Think of an analogy: What if I said 'It's my car, I don't want any brakes...and it just endangered my life? [But] you're endangering the lives of other drivers. That's what this is about."" And for those zealous small-government types, consider this: Even in the most ardent libertarian circles, there's a classic theory that ""the right to swing my fist ends where the other man's nose begins."" It's a pretty standard argument that makes sense. Unless, apparently, you are running for political office.","Gloria Borger says some GOP politicians have pandered to worried parents .
She says they should be following the advice of scientists and strongly endorsing vaccinations ."
"(CNN)Serbian forces committed egregious violent acts against ethnic Croatians in the early 1990s, but they don't equate to genocide, a U.N. court ruled Tuesday. The 153-page ruling from the International Court of Justice means that modern-day Serbia will not have to pay restitution to Croatia, which in 1991 split from what was then Yugoslavia. The decision relates only to the two national governments' responsibility to one another, not the culpability of any individuals for targeting members of an ethnic group. Such individual cases are handled by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), another U.N. court. ""Croatia has not established that the only reasonable inference that can be drawn from the (Serbians') pattern of conduct ... was the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, the Croat group,"" the International Court of Justice (or ICJ) ruled. ""... It follows ... Croatia has failed to substantiate its allegation that genocide was committed."" In addition to dismissing Croatia's case that its citizens had been victims of genocide, the ICJ also rebuffed Serbia's counterclaim that Croatian forces had committed genocide against its own citizens. This all relates to what happened in the 1990s, in the bloody aftermath of Yugoslavia splintering into separate nations. Many of the most horrific allegations have been levied against those aligned with the Yugoslavia government -- the closest equivalent to what is now the Republic of Serbia -- for its actions in Kosovo and Bosnia. In fact, several Serbians have been charged with genocide, though none yet specifically tied to actions inside Croatia. They include Radislav Krstic, sentenced to 46 years after the ICTY convicted him in relation to a five-day slaughter of up to 8,000 Muslims in the town of Srebrenica in what's been called the worst atrocity in Europe since World War II. Former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic became the first sitting head of state to be indicted by a U.N. tribunal when he was charged with 66 counts for crimes against humanity, genocide, and war crimes, though he was found dead in his cell before his years-long trial in front of the ICTY finished. Ex-Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic is still on trial for two genocide charges and nine others related to ethnic violence during the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s. When Ratko Mladic's own trial on 11 counts of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity opened in 2012, the former general -- who is accused of orchestrating a horrific campaign of ethnic cleansing -- showed no remorse, even appearing to threaten victims in court. Yet even as such individual cases push forward, courts have been reluctant to hold governments involved in the conflict directly responsible for genocide. In 2007, for instance, the International Court of Justice acquitted Serbia of committing genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina. But, in the same ruling, the U.N. court did find Serbia guilty of failing to prevent genocide in Srebrenica. Tuesday's ICJ ruling relates specifically to what Serbian forces did in Croatia between 1991 and 1995. The violence began when Serbian troops went into Croatia ostensibly to aid armed ethnic Serbians trying to create their own autonomous states there. The U.N. court considered reams of evidence, from both sides, about what happened in the years that followed. And some of what happened, the U.N. court ruled, was consistent with genocide. For example, the ICJ found Serbian and allied forces responsible for a ""large number of killings"" that disproportionately affected Croats, ""which suggests that they may have been systematically targeted."" The forces also ""injured (ethnic Croatians) and perpetrated acts of ill-treatment, torture, sexual violence and rape (that contributed) to the physical or biological destruction of the protected group,"" according to the court. Croats were singled out in other less lethal ways, like restricting their movement to create ""a climate of coercion and terror"" and spur them to leave, the ICJ said.  The court didn't find sufficient evidence, however, to implicate Serbian forces on other grounds, like depriving Croatians of food and medical care. But even if some of the acts could fall under the umbrella of genocide, there must be evidence of intent -- that the forces went in aiming to destroy a group of people -- in order for these actions to be labeled genocide under the so-called Genocide Convention, which dates to 1948. That was not proven, in the eyes of the International Court of Justice. ""In view of the fact that dolus specialis has been established by Croatia,"" the court said, using the legal term for a specific intent, ""its claims of conspiracy to commit genocide, direct and public incitement to commit genocide and attempt to commit genocide also necessarily fail. ""Accordingly, Croatia's claim must be dismissed in its entirety.""","A U.N. court finds that Serbian forces did commit large-scale killings, other violent acts .
But there's not enough evidence showing intent to commit genocide, the court rules .
The same court dismisses Serbia's counterclaim that Croatia committed genocide ."
"(CNN) -- Films have altered the course of human history before. The rise of Nazism would not have been as rapid and absolute had it not been for the Reich's potent command of propaganda, including Leni Riefenstahl's monumental glorification of the fascist regime, ""Triumph of the Will."" And D.W. Griffith's celebration of white supremacy, ""The Birth of a Nation,"" helped to resurrect the Ku Klux Klan. Both these films are repellent, yet are judged to be masterpieces of world cinema, and their directors among the greatest of all time. So it's hard to imagine that a movie as slight and crude as ""The Interview"" could serve as a similar kind of historical watershed. And yet, future generations may well look to it as marking the emergence of a new chapter in geopolitics, dominated by a fresh set of actors and wildly different forms of conflict. If the attacks of September 11 taught us to fear insurgent groups using improvised weapons against civilians -- al Qaeda, the Taliban, ISIS -- what we've learned from the ""Interview"" fiasco is that even nation states and ""traditional"" terror organizations can now find themselves to be nothing more than blindsided bystanders in strange battles between entities with hidden (or purposely misleading) agendas. Corporations. Mysterious ad hoc hacker networks. Even motivated individuals. And these struggles will play out in the dark, with far-reaching and unpredictable consequences. Was the hacker attack that crippled media titan Sony insider sabotage, an attempt at extortion, a terrorist strike or, as more hawkish types have suggested, the overture to formal war? Were its perpetrators disgruntled employees, Internet pranksters, black hat mercenaries or the shadowy digital armies of rival nations? Perhaps the most frightening thing is that, months after the assaults, we still don't know exactly when they began, what their true objective was and, of course, who was actually behind them. Sony was quick to assign blame to North Korea, based on the conclusions of federal investigators. President Barack Obama issued a condemnation of the hermit kingdom's ""cybervandalism"" and promised to ""respond proportionately."" And, in a gesture of profound corporate cowardice, Sony yanked ""The Interview"" after a number of movie theater chains said they would not screen the movie. Since then, other researchers have raised serious questions about North Korea's real role in the hacks, pointing to the fact that while North Korea might have had a clear motive -- suppressing the release of a work that might embarrass its supreme leader -- early messages to Sony reportedly did not focus on ""The Interview,"" and instead sought vague ""monetary compensation."" Meanwhile, publicly released evidence of North Korean involvement seems flimsy, the country itself has hotly denied it is behind the hacks, and more recent theories have pointed instead to a possible inside job, or to hackers from other countries with greater resources and more ambiguous aims. The results of independent linguistic analyses performed on the messages sent by hackers make their North Korean origin questionable, and even suggest they were translated from Russian. (It's also worth noting that Russia's Foreign Ministry this week held a press conference slamming ""The Interview"" as ""aggressively scandalous,"" while also denouncing the U.S. accusations against North Korea as being without ""direct evidence."" As these theories and allegations have circulated, the playing field has continued to shift. A group claiming to be members of the enigmatic hacker coalition Anonymous vowed vague reprisal against North Korea. A few days later, North Korea's Internet access was shut down by a denial of service attack. As all this occurred, Sony changed its mind about releasing ""The Interview,"" allowing 300 theaters to screen the film despite warnings of physical attacks on moviegoers, while putting it on Google's Play store and YouTube. But the fact that it instantly leapt to the top of the popularity charts on both platforms has led some conspiracy minded people to wonder whether the entire episode wasn't a PR stunt (albeit one that got out of hand -- the revelations from the email leaks were far too damaging to have been released intentionally). And this is where things get oddly meta. I mentioned that ""The Interview"" comes off as a trivial work of frat-boy comedy, full of the toilet humor, misogyny, gay-panic japery and racial stereotypes that have marked other Franco/Rogen collaborations. (However, unlike others who've criticized it, I don't think it is any worse than, say, ""Pineapple Express."") But the movie's last scene (spoiler alert!), consciously or not, turns it into something with a darker kind of self-awareness. Franco's character, celebrity talk show host Dave Skylark, is shown reading the last page of his best-selling book about their madcap assassination adventure in North Korea to a huge and rapt crowd. He begins as follows: ""It was the beginning of a revolution. A revolution Aaron [Rappaport, Skylark's producer, played by Rogen] and I started."" They continue by noting that this ""revolution"" was not one waged with ordinary weapons, but with the power of the media -- and with what can only be defined as trollery. ""This was a revolution,"" he continues, ""ignited with nothing more than a camera and some questions. Questions that led a man once revered as a god among mortals to cry and sh*t his pants. The end."" It's a concise summary of the new era in which we live, where the ability to manipulate media and technology has increasingly become a critical strategic resource, where combat is conducted not just on battlefields but on servers and screens and social networks, and where it's increasingly impossible to tell the difference between pranks, crimes and acts of war.

"Havana, Cuba (CNN)Amid recent rumors of ill health or even possible death, Cuban state media has released 21 photos of former leader Fidel Castro. The photo spread appeared late Monday in the online version of Cuba's state-run newspaper, Granma. In the pictures, the 88-year-old Castro and his wife Dalia Soto del Valle are shown with the leader of the student association of the University of Havana, Randy Perdomo Garcia. The two men are shown seated, looking at a newspaper and watching TV. The photos are accompanied by an article written by Perdomo recounting his time with the former leader during the reported January 23 meeting.  According to Granma, the photos were published because ""Cuba is anxious to know about him."" These are the first photos of Castro to appear publicly since August. Just last week, in a message reported to be from the former Cuban leader, Castro endorsed the fledgling talks to restore diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States, but added he still ""didn't trust"" U.S. officials. In the letter published on the Granma website, Castro said that although he didn't ""trust U.S. policies and have not exchanged a word with them, this does not mean however that I would oppose a peaceful solution to conflicts or threats of war."" In December, Cuba and the United States exchanged prisoners and agreed to discuss normalizing relations that had been trapped in over five decades of Cold War animosity. At age 32, Castro led a band of guerrillas who overthrew a corrupt dictatorship in 1959. The U.S. broke relations with Cuba in 1961, amid fears that Castro and his bearded revolutionaries harbored communist sympathies. Despite scores of CIA assassination attempts against him and a failed U.S.-backed invasion of Cuba, Castro stayed in power until 2006, when an intestinal ailment forced him to step down.","Castro stepped down from power in 2006 .

"The story was horrific: An 8-year-old girl died from internal injuries suffered on her wedding night with a 40-year-old man. It caused outrage -- and numerous calls to end child marriage in Yemen. Authorities have denied the claims, saying she was neither married nor injured, and they held a news conference and paraded a girl they claimed was ""Rawan,"" accompanied by a man they described as her father. Despite the conflicting reports between local residents and government officials, some say, the story sheds light on the issue of child marriage. ""We do not want the government's denial on this case to halt the international efforts to pressure the Yemeni government to end child marriage,"" said Hooria Mashhour, Yemen's human rights minister. ""The efforts need to continue until a law is passed to end this practice."" ""The story of Rawan was completely fabricated. After investigating, we came to a conclusion that she was alive and healthy,"" said Mosleh Ezzi, head of prosecution in the northern town of Haradh, where the incident reportedly happened. ""She attended the press conference with her father and friends who all supported her in these tough times,"" Ezzi told CNN, adding that ""medical tests proved that Rawan is still a virgin and was never married."" Yemeni national security chief Ali Hassan Al-Ahmadi said he directed local authorities to find the girl and identify her. ""I can ensure that she had indeed suffered no harm,"" Al-Ahmadi said. When reports emerged last week that she died a few days after being married off to a 40-year-old man, Yemenis were horrified. International outrage quickly grew as the alleged incident highlighted once again the controversial issue of child marriage in the nation, where the practice is still legal. Residents told local media that Rawan died of internal bleeding, believed to be the result of sexual intercourse that tore her uterus and other organs. But confusion surrounded the case from the start, with residents telling CNN that she had died, while officials insisted she was alive and well. Mashhour, the human rights minister, said growing anger over the case presents an opportunity to enact laws to end child marriage in the nation once and for all. She said the push has faced many hurdles. ""Unfortunately, many factions in the government today are fighting our efforts to end child marriage, and that is why international pressure is needed,"" she said. Yemeni child rights advocate Ahmed Al-Qureshi, who'd investigated the case for more than two weeks, said that while no evidence showed Rawan had been married and had died, child marriage remains a crisis in the nation. ""This case was fabricated, but many other cases of child marriage are true and tragic,"" Al-Qureshi said. In deeply tribal and conservative Yemen,  the issue of child marriage is complicated. Human Rights Watch says more than half of all young girls there are married before age 18. About 14% are married before age 15. Many Yemenis say they are forced to sell off their girls to older, wealthier men. When reports of Rawan's case began making headlines, the group issued a statement urging Yemen to protect  girls by setting 18 as the legal minimum age for marriage. ""The current political transition and drafting process for a new constitution offer a unique opportunity for the Yemeni government to enact laws protecting the rights of girls,"" Human Rights Watch said. Yemen should step in to end the practice, the group said. ""Thousands of Yemeni girls have their childhood stolen and their futures destroyed because they are forced to marry too young,"" said Liesl Gerntholtz from Human Rights Watch. ""The Yemeni government should end this abusive practice."" In 2009, the Yemeni parliament passed legislation raising the minimum age of marriage to 17. But conservative parliamentarians argued the bill violated Islamic law, which does not stipulate a minimum age. The bill was never signed. Activist groups and politicians are still trying change the law, but more than 100 leading religious clerics have said restricting the age of marriage is ""un-Islamic."" Over the past few years, several Yemeni child bride cases have left the world stunned. In 2008, Nujood Ali, 10, became an international sensation when she went to a Sanaa court and asked a judge for a divorce. After a highly publicized trial, she was granted one. Two years later, a 12-year-old Yemeni bride died of internal bleeding following intercourse three days after she was married off to an older man, according to the United Nations Children's Fund. Over the summer,  a video of Nada Al-Ahdal, 11, accusing her parents of trying to marry her off in exchange for money, was uploaded to YouTube and quickly went viral. Her parents denied the story, and children's rights activists questioned the veracity of her claims. But the video was still viewed by millions of people.","In Yemen, authorities say the story of the death of an 8-year-old bride is false .

"The African Union urged the International Criminal Court to postpone cases against sitting leaders as accusations of unfair treatment grow against the war crimes tribunal. Leaders from the 54-nation body gathered in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa on Saturday to review their relationship with the court based in The Hague, Netherlands. Kenyan and Sudanese presidents face charges at the court, and African leaders have long accused it of unfair treatment. 'Loud and clear' ""Sitting heads of state and government should not be prosecuted while in office and we have resolved to speak with one voice to make sure that our concerns are heard loud and clear,"" said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Ethiopian foreign affairs minister. The trial for Kenyan Deputy President William Ruto is under way while his boss, President Uhuru Kenyatta, is scheduled to appear in court next month. Both are on trial for alleged crimes against humanity linked to postelection violence six years ago. They deny the charges. Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir has largely shunned an ICC warrant for his arrest for alleged war crimes. ""We  are deeply troubled by the fact that a sitting head of state and his deputy are for the first time being tried in an international court, which infringes on the sovereignty of Kenya and undermines ... the country's reconciliation and reform process,"" Ghebreyesus said. Growing accusations . Others including Ethiopia and Uganda  have joined in, accusing the court of targeting their leaders. ""African countries form the largest constituency of the Rome Statute and I think all of them have expressed issues that they want addressed at one time or another,"" said Amina Mohamed, the Kenyan minister for foreign affairs. ""The summit will present that opportunity."" ICC history . The International Criminal Court was set up in 2002 to prosecute claims of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Rights groups say the court is crucial in ending impunity in African politics. ""Some of the most heinous crimes were committed during the conflicts which marked the twentieth century,"" the ICC said. ""Unfortunately, many of these violations of international law have remained unpunished."" Kenya's previous administration reneged on a deal to set up a special tribunal to try suspects in the postelection violence that left more than 1,000 people dead, prompting  the international court to step in. Accusations of double standards . The court has consistently said it is not a substitute for domestic justice systems, and only intervenes if the national judicial system is either unwilling or unable to carry out justice. But some leaders have accused it of double standards, with the Ethiopian foreign minister saying it is jeopardizing peace efforts. ""The International Criminal Court's way of operating particularly its unfair treatment of Africa and Africans leaves much to be desired,""   he said. So far, all cases before the court are against Africans in eight countries, including Ivory Coast , Uganda, Sudan and Mali. Some of the cases were handed over by their respective African governments, including  Ivory Coast; others were referred to the court by the U.N. Security Council. Rights groups: Court ensures justice for all . Rights groups are urging African leaders to support the court, saying it is crucial in ensuring justice for everyone. ""African countries played an active role at the negotiations to establish the court, and 34 African countries -- a majority of African Union members -- are ICC members,"" Human Rights Watch said in a statement. ""Any withdrawal from the ICC would send the wrong signal about Africa's commitment to protect and promote human rights and to reject impunity."" The Kenyan parliament voted in September to withdraw from the court's jurisdiction after repeatedly calling on it to drop the cases. A withdrawal would take a while to implement because it involves steps such as a formal notification to the United Nations.","""We have resolved to speak with one voice"" on ICC issue, official says .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A murky Islamic militant group has described a deadly attack in China's Tiananmen Square last month as a ""jihadi operation"" and warned of more violence to come, according to an organization that monitors extremist websites. In a speech posted online, Abdullah Mansour, the leader of the Turkestan Islamic Party (T.I.P.), said those who carried out the attack in the heavily policed center of Beijing were ""mujahideen,"" the SITE Intelligence Group said in a report late last week. On October 28, a vehicle drove through security barriers into a crowd in Tiananmen Square, crashed into a pedestrian bridge in front of the Forbidden City and burst into flames. The attack killed five people -- including the three in the vehicle -- and wounded 40 others. Chinese authorities have accused Uyghurs -- a Turkic-speaking, predominantly Muslim ethnic group from the western region of Xinjiang -- of carrying out the vehicle attack. East Turkestan is the name used by many Uyghur groups to refer to Xinjiang. Frequent outbreaks of unrest have hit the resource-rich region, where the arrival of waves of Han Chinese people over the decades has fueled tensions with the Uyghurs. Chinese authorities have cracked down heavily on violence involving Uyghurs, deepening resentment. China links Islamic terrorist group to Tiananmen Square crash . 'Only the beginning' It was unclear from the SITE report if Mansour was claiming responsibility for the Tiananmen attack or just commenting on it. But he warned that ""such operations are only the beginning,"" according to SITE, and that Uyghur fighters will target the Great Hall of the People, a grand building next to Tiananman Square where the Chinese parliament meets and ceremonial events are held. ""O Chinese unbelievers, know that you have been fooling East Turkestan for the last 60 years, but now they have awakened,"" Mansour was quoted as saying by SITE. ""The people have learned who is the real enemy and they returned to their own religion. They learned the lesson."" The audio recording of his speech was part of a roughly 8-minute video posted on the T.I.P.'s website on November 12, SITE said. His comments were referenced in a number of Chinese state-media outlets, including Xinhua, the official news agency. Chinese authorities have said they believe the Tiananmen attack was instigated by a separatist group, the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (E.T.I.M.), which Beijing has linked to outbreaks of violence in Xinjiang in the past. Tiananmen crash: Terrorism or cry of desperation? 'Information vacuum' The relationship between the E.T.I.M. and the T.I.P. is unclear. Some analysts suggest that the two may be part of the same organization. The T.I.P. has been cited in previous years as threatening revenge over Chinese treatment of Uyghurs, but little is known about the group. ""As far as anyone knows, the Turkestan Islamic Party may only exist in name alone,"" said Nicholas Dynon, a researcher at Macquarie University in Australia. ""It has been referred to as one of the many jiangdu (or, Xinjiang independence) groups for many years, yet no one is quite sure whether or not they exist - at least in their own right."" The available evidence on separatist organizations in Xinjiang points to ""several disparate groups that neither have a history of coordination nor -- it would appear -- the means or will to coordinate,"" he said. ""What we know of them is largely through two diametrically opposed parties: the Chinese government and Uyghur diaspora groups,"" Dynon said. ""And the truth about T.I.P. and its counterparts lies somewhere in the information vacuum between the two."" He said he was skeptical that the T.I.P. had carried out the Tiananmen attack. ""Jiangdu groups have supposedly claimed responsibility for attacks outside of Xinjiang in the past, but such claims have never been verified,"" he said. CNN's Katie Hunt contributed to this report.","A monitoring organization cites a video posted by the Turkestan Islamic Party .

"Maxine Powell, the mentor behind the smooth success and individual charm of Motown Records' stars for almost five decades, died Monday, the Detroit Free Press reported. She was 98. Powell, who started as a personal development coach with Motown in 1964, was known for teaching Motown artists how to walk, talk and even think with class. She played an influential role in nurturing its future stars including Diana Ross and Marvin Gaye by giving them lessons in media relations and proper manners. Mary Wilson, an original member of Motown's Supremes, quoted Powell as saying, ""One day, you may be performing before kings and queens."" ""And we actually did,"" Wilson said in a 2002 interview with CNN. ""But it was because they taught us how to sit, you know, to talk, and all of these kinds of things."" In a statement Monday, Motown founder Berry Gordy said Powell was tough, but ""poised, professional, and very thankful"" as she worked with artists. Gordy's statement quoted Powell as telling the young artists: ""I love you all, but don't confuse me with your mother -- she's stuck with you, I'm not!"" ""Ladies, remember your gloves, walk with class like you were taught -- and always remember, do not protrude the buttocks."" ""She brought something to Motown that no other record company had. She was a star in her own right -- an original,"" Gordy's statement added. Singer-songwriter and producer Smokey Robinson also paid tribute to Maxine Powell's contribution. ""She led and lived a long wonderful life. I just saw her a couple of weeks ago and she was very mentally sharp. She was an essential part of Motown,"" he said in a statement. ""We all loved her and she will be truly missed, but the evidence of her will live on and on through all of the Motown family.""

"(CNN)Passengers aboard a United Airlines flight from Chicago to Denver got sick from a cabin pressure issue that forced a quick landing, according to an airline spokeswoman. United Airlines Flight 1218 took off at 9:01 a.m., but shortly after it reached 15,000 feet, the pilot took it below 10,000 feet and returned to O'Hare International Airport, according to tracking website FlightAware.com. Below 10,000 feet is a safe altitude for an unpressurized plane. ""The flight landed safely, and we requested paramedics meet the flight to assist a few customers who reported feeling ill,"" said United Airlines spokeswoman Karen May. Seven ambulances met the plane and 175 patients complaining of ear pain or nausea were checked out, according to the Chicago Fire Department. No passengers or crew were taken to the hospital. ""Maintenance is inspecting the aircraft as we accommodate the customers,"" May said in the statement. FAA officials are also investigating the circumstances of the landing. The plane, a Boeing 737-900, is almost brand new.  Records show it was delivered to United in March of last year. As part of the manufacturing process each Boeing aircraft must withstand a two-hour long pressurization test, called a ""high blow."" The cabin is pressurized to nearly 15 pounds per square inch, well above the normal operating levels, to confirm it properly seals. CNN's Shawn Nottingham and Thom Patterson contributed to this report.","A United flight returned to Chicago shortly after takeoff .

"At least 16 people were killed and many more were wounded when a U.N. shelter in northern Gaza was hit during Thursday's fighting, officials said. John Ging, director of the U.N.'s Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, confirmed to CNN's Christiane Amanpour that 16 died in the strike. Numbers were still coming in as to how many people were wounded, he said. A Palestinian government statement condemned the incident, calling it ""Israeli brutal aggression that targeted"" Gaza's displaced. It demanded an end to the ""Israeli war machine."" The strike wounded more than 200, most of them women and children, the statement said. It also said the death toll was 16. It's unclear who was behind the incident. The Israeli military said it could have been a rocket fired from Gaza that fell short of Israel and exploded. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who met with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in Cairo, was irate. ""I am telling to the parties -- both Israelis and Hamas, Palestinians, that it is morally wrong to kill your own people,"" he said. ""Whole world has been watching, is watching with great concern. You must stop fighting. And enter into dialogue. ""Whatever grievances you may have, this is wrong. Why are you continuing to kill people? There are many other ways to resolve this issue without killing each other."" The coordinates of the school in Beit Hanoun, which was serving a shelter for families in Gaza, had been given to the Israeli military, said a U.N. spokesman, Chris Gunness. Footage from the school showed pools of blood and images from hospitals showed absolute chaos. There were so many victims than many gurneys included two wounded children. One father carried his small daughter into the hospital. There wasn't much the dad could do but try to comfort his little girl as she cried and begged for him not to leave her. In another area a mortician wrapped up the body of a 1-year-old girl who was killed. All the while people wandered through the halls, trying desperately to find where their loved ones had been taken. A CNN crew that visited the school three hours after the hit discovered a one-inch deep hole in the concrete in the  courtyard where people were killed and injured. It appeared shrapnel struck people within a 30-meter radius. Walls were hit as high as about eight meters above the ground. CNN personnel didn't see the remnants of any rocket or missile. Some witnesses told CNN there were three to four explosions. Fighting in the area . An Israel Defense Forces statement said militants had shot at the Israeli military and the IDF responded with ""fire toward the origins of the shooting."" The IDF said it had told people at the school to evacuate because of the fighting in the area and given a four-hour window to get people out. Israeli officials told CNN they had warned U.N. officials for three days to evacuate. Shortly after the strike, Gunness tweeted that the coordinates of the shelter had been given to the Israeli military and that the United Nations Relief and Works Agency had twice tried to coordinate with the Israeli military to evacuate the civilians at the shelter. The shelter is in an area that has seen intense fighting recently. Gunness posted: ""Precise co-ordinates of the UNRWA shelter in Beit Hanoun had been formally given to the Israeli army. ... "" Then minutes later, he tweeted: ""Over the course of the day UNRWA tried 2 coodinate with the Israeli Army a window for civilians 2 leave & it was never granted. ..."" It is unclear how many people were in the shelter, but U.N. schools can typically hold up to 1,500 people. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which is helping shelter Palestinians displaced by the conflict, said that 140,000 residents have taken refuge in 83 schools in Gaza that are swerving as shelters . On Wednesday, Ban announced he was ordering a review of incidents where rockets were placed at United Nations Relief and Works Agency schools. Ban demanded that militants stop endangering civilians by putting rockets at the shelters. Is Hamas using human shields in Gaza? Not the first U.N. school to be hit . Thursday's hit at the shelter is just the latest violence that has raged for more than three weeks between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Hundreds have died, including many children. Thursday's strike marks the third time a U.N. school serving as a shelter has been hit. The first occurred on July 22 in eastern Gaza, where about 300 people were staying, the UNRWA said. The second occurred Wednesday in central Gaza at a shelter were about 1,500 were staying. News of Thursday's hit on the shelter also comes as the Israeli military said the number of airstrikes it was launching had been lowered. Israel Defense Forces said it hit 35 terror targets overnight. A day earlier, the number was 187. The Israeli military also reported a sharp fall in the number of rockets fired from Gaza early Thursday, although as the day wore on, more rockets were lofted toward Israel, some in the direction of the international airport in Tel Aviv. But the human cost of the conflict remains clear. It can be seen in the blocks of rubble that line Gaza neighborhoods, where the Israeli military has relentlessly bombed. It's evident in the frayed nerves of Israeli citizens who dive into bomb shelters as Hamas rockets fly in their direction on a daily basis. At least 797 people have been killed and more than 5100 wounded since the start of an Israeli operation on Gaza, said Dr. Ashraf al-Qidra, a spokesman for the Gaza Health Ministry. On Thursday, 107 people were killed, he said. An Israeli military representative said Thursday that the violence has killed 32 soldiers and three civilians. Two killed at West Bank protest . Two Palestinian men were shot and killed during a demonstration in the West Bank in support of residents of Gaza, Palestinian lawmaker Mustafa Barghouti said. He said more than 15,000 people were marching when Israeli soldiers fired. More than 100 people were wounded, he said. The health minister in Ramallah said 185 of the wounded were brought there for treatment. Mosques using loudspeakers called for people to donate blood at hospitals, Palestinian television reported. Protesters were ""throwing rocks, firebombs and fireworks"" at Israeli security forces, the Jerusalem Post reported. The newspaper, which put the size of the demonstration at 10,000 people, said 13 Israeli police officers were injured. Diplomatic efforts, some flights to Israel resume . Kerry was back in Cairo, continuing his shuttle diplomacy to forge a truce a day after meeting with Israeli and Palestinian leaders as well Secretary-General Ban. ""Over the last few days, Secretary Kerry has been engaged with the Israelis, Palestinians, Egyptians, Europeans, the U.N., the Arab League, Qatar, Jordan, Turkey and the UAE (United Arab Emirates) to determine how to achieve an end to the current violence and build a process that can create a sustainable path forward,"" White House Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz said. Can Kerry end the Gaza-Israel bloodshed? The diplomatic effort wasn't solely limited to the United States, as several Middle Eastern nations worked to try to win Hamas' agreement for an Egyptian-led cease-fire. Hamas said Turkey and Kuwait were also involved. Meanwhile, Delta Air Lines joined Air Canada and United Airlines in resuming flights to Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv, airline spokesman Morgan Durrant said. It has been a day and a half since the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration imposed the prohibition of flights to the city because of security concerns. On Thursday, Lufthansa Group canceled all Lufthansa, Germanwings, Austrian Airlines, Swiss and Brussels Airlines flights flying to and from Tel Aviv through Friday. Lufthansa said in a statement that it ""acknowledges the considerable efforts"" Israel has made to protect the airport using its ""Iron Dome"" -- system that targets incoming rockets and fires an interceptor missile to destroy them in the air. How does the Iron Dome system work? When Lufthansa is assured that protection can be ""verifiably guaranteed"" it will resume flights. Passengers who were booked on canceled flights can rebook free of charge or have their ticket price refunded, the carrier added. The canceling of flights has caused some controversy which continued Thursday with CNN's Wolf Blitzer asking Israeli Finance Minister Yair Lapid about it. The FAA's ban was ""a major setback to Israel,"" Blitzer said. ""Yes, it was and it was wrong,"" Lapid answered. ""It was a win for Hamas, right?"" Blitzer said. Yair responded by saying that Los Angeles International Airport was ""ten times"" more dangerous that Ben Gurion International though he acknowledges that a rocket had landed about a mile from the airport.

"(CNN)It's three down, two to go for Tina Maze. Monday's gold medal win in the Alpine Combined, to go with a silver in the Super-G and gold in the Downhill at this year's Alpine World Ski Championships, means Maze is on the verge of making history. Should success in the Giant Slalom and Slalom follow then the 31-year-old will become the first woman to ever win five individual medals at a single World Championships, with Lasse Kjus of Norway in 1999 the only man to have achieved the feat. ""I'm more than halfway, so three is done, missing two more,"" Maze told NBC Sports. ""I hope I can do it, for sure. It's not easy."" The Slovenian's latest triumph at Beaver Creek saw her prevail by 0.22 seconds in an event that combines the downhill and slalom runs, with Austrian duo Nicole Hosp and Michaela Kirchgasser taking silver and bronze respectively. Leading after the morning's downhill section, Maze secured the fifth fastest time in the afternoon's slalom run to finish in a combined time of 2:33.37 to secure gold. Maze, the World Cup overall points leader, landed a fourth world title but her first in the Alpine Combined event -- and she celebrated the success with a cartwheel across the finish area. ""I'm totally exhausted, it's a tough program and late start time for the slalom and it's also really warm,"" Maze told the International Ski Federation's official website. ""But winning is always amazing and now there's time to recover and enjoy. Even though I'm tired I did my best and I'm happy with the win."" Her task had been made easier following the disqualification of Lindsey Vonn, who was seen breaking into tears after straddling a gate during her slalom run. The American last week won her first medal at a World Championships in four years with bronze in the Super-G, but Thursday's Giant Slalom now looks to be her only chance of claiming gold at Beaver Creek, having also finished fifth in the Downhill. ""Just try to forget today as fast as possible and move on to the next race,"" Vonn told Associated Press. Maze will also be readying herself for the Giant Slalom event, knowing that if she can replicate Monday's form there, as well as in Saturday's Slalom, then her place in the record books will be assured.","Tina Maze wins gold in the Alpine Combined at Alpine World Ski Championships .

"Douglas Engelbart, whose invention of the mouse transformed the way people interact with computers, has died. Engelbart died Tuesday night at his home in Atherton, California, SRI International -- the research institute where he once worked -- said in a statement. He was 88. ""Doug's legacy is immense — anyone in the world who uses a mouse or enjoys the productive benefits of a personal computer is indebted to him,"" Curtis R. Carlson, SRI's president and CEO, said in a written statement. Decades ago, Engelbart came up with the idea we now know as a mouse. His first prototype, which featured a carved out wooden block, wheels and a tiny red button, looks quite different from the sleek plastic designs now seen in homes and offices around the world. A radar technician during World War II, Engelbart worked at the Stanford Research Institute during the 1960s. It was there that a vision of people sitting in front of a video screen, interacting with a computer, came to him. ""I knew enough engineering and had enough experience as a radar person to know that if a computer can punch cards or print paper, it can draw anything you want on a screen,"" he told CNN in 1997 after receiving a $500,000 prize for American innovation. Engelbart invented and patented what he called the ""x-y position indicator,"" receiving a $10,000 check for the invention. He told CNN he couldn't recall who on his team had decided to call it a mouse. At the time, it wasn't easy to convince fellow scientists to follow his vision, Engelbart said. But he persisted. Later, he went on to found the Doug Engelbart Institute, a nonprofit dedicated to boosting the collective ability to solve complex, urgent problems on a global scale. ""Sometimes I reflect on how naive somebody has to be in order to get visions -- and plug away at them -- that ultimately proceed, and how many other people with visions that are as naive just fall off the cliff,"" Engelbart told CNN in 1997. In addition to the computer mouse, Engelbart's work at SRI from 1957 to 1977 helped develop tech innovations such as display editing, online processing, linking and in-file object addressing, use of multiple windows, hypermedia, and context-sensitive help, the institute said. ""Doug was a giant who made the world a much better place and who deeply touched those of us who knew him,"" Carlson said. ""SRI was very privileged and honored to have him as one of our 'family.' He brought tremendous value to society. We will miss his genius, warmth and charm."" Engelbart is survived by his wife and four children.

"They were traveling to raise awareness about the spread of the deadly Ebola virus. Instead, it seems, they encountered violence. Eight people on an Ebola team were killed in southeastern Guinea, near the country's border with Liberia, a government spokesman said in a statement Thursday. Among them were health care workers and local journalists. Residents in the small town of Womey threw stones at the Guinea Ebola team when they arrived earlier this week, forcing them to flee, spokesman Albert Damantang Camara said. Some members of the group were able to safely reach the nearby town of Nzerekore, he said, while nine others went to find refuge around Womey. Only one of the nine was found alive, hiding near the town. The Guinean government has strongly condemned the killings and vowed to hunt down those responsible and bring them to justice. Camara said security forces have been deployed to support the ongoing investigation, and six people have been arrested in connection with the incident. The fight against the spread of the Ebola virus ""should be an opportunity for Guineans to set aside their differences and stand welded in this national effort,"" he said. Ebola outbreak: Ways to help . This is not the first time violence has flared in West Africa amid the deadliest Ebola outbreak on record. There have been other reports of teams from Medecins Sans Frontieres, the Red Cross and local ministries of health being pelted with rocks as they try to enter areas affected by the virus, MSF's Dr. Marc Forget told CNN. Earlier in the outbreak, a team from Medecins Sans Frontieres, also known as Doctors Without Borders, had to stop working in Guinea because local residents believed they had brought the virus with them. In August, Ebola patients were forced to flee a health care facility in Monrovia, Liberia, as it came under attack by armed assailants. No one was injured in the attack, but the men stole mattresses and equipment, Liberian National Police spokesman Sam Collins said. ""It was an attack from people afraid of Ebola,"" Collins told CNN. ""Everybody is afraid."" Sierra Leone starts nationwide lockdown . The outbreak, primarily spreading in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, has killed more than 2,600 people. Health officials have said the number of Ebola cases is growing too fast -- that they need more supplies, more health care workers and a better system to trace the virus. President Obama recently announced that the United States will be sending troops and materials to build field hospitals, as well as additional health care workers and medical supplies to the region. Maj. Gen. Darryl Williams, the U.S. Army-Africa commander, will lead the U.S. military's response -- officially called Operation United Assistance. He arrived in Monrovia two days ago with a 12-person assessment team, Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said Friday. The assessment team will be ""evaluating what our deployed U.S. military personnel will need in terms of support infrastructure to sustain the operations for up to six months or however long U.S. military assistance is required,"" Kirby said. Both he and U.S. President Barack Obama have said the Department of Defense is prepared to devote up to $1 billion in resources to fight Ebola, saying it's a matter of national security.","Ebola team traveling to raise awareness in Guinea comes under attack .

"Compton, California (CNN)Former rap mogul Marion ""Suge"" Knight pleaded not guilty Tuesday to murder charges in a fatal hit-and-run incident before complaining of chest pains in court and being taken to the hospital. Knight, 49, stood in a defendant's box next to his attorneys and intently read the complaint against him as the hearing opened. Wearing a Los Angeles County orange inmate jumpsuit, he glanced back into the gallery several times in the Compton, California, courtroom during the brief hearing and answered the judge's questions politely with, ""Yes, sir, your honor."" Later in the session, Knight was transported to a hospital after saying he was having chest pains, according to Officer John Gardner of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Information Bureau. Mark Blankenship, president of Everlert Entertainment and who has business dealings with Knight, told reporters Tuesday he believed Knight was under strain because he hasn't had access to his medicine. ""Imagine yourself being picked up unexpectedly into a jail cell and not having the right medicine. I know they've been seeking to get him medicine. He has special medicines he needs,"" Blankenship told reporters. ""It's a medical condition."" Knight faces up to life in prison if convicted in the fatal hit-and-run in Compton last week. Knight is accused of running over two men and killing one of them following an argument. The man who died was Terry Carter, 55, a former rap record label owner. The second man is Cle ""Bone"" Sloan, 51. Sloan's attorney, Michael Shapiro, said Tuesday that his client is in shock and has suffered a serious concussion and might not be able to walk again. Sloan's left foot was mangled in the alleged hit-and-run, Shapiro said. The attorney added that his client is out of the hospital now and is in a secret location with hired protection. Knight, who was out on bail in a separate robbery case, is charged with one count of murder, one count of attempted murder, and two counts of hit-and-run with an allegation that he committed a serious and violent felony while out on bail, the district attorney's office said in a statement. He has prior convictions, ""making this a third strike case,"" it said. Knight turned himself in to Los Angeles Sheriff's Department investigators early Friday. On Tuesday, Knight's attorney, David Kenner, told reporters outside the courthouse that Knight was trying to flee from an attack in the hit-and-run incident. ""It's too early to tell, but clearly from what I understand ... he was being attacked and trying to get away from that attack, no more than that,"" Kenner said. Knight felt remorseful about the death and the injury in the incident, Kenner said. ""It's not his fault,"" Kenner added about Knight. Carter and Knight were friends, Kenner said. ""They've known each other for a long time,"" the attorney said. Another of Knight's attorneys, James Blatt, has also said that Knight feared for his life and was trying to flee, according to CNN affiliate KCAL-TV and the Los Angeles Times. ""We feel strongly Mr. Knight did not do anything wrong in this matter. He was attacked by a number of individuals; that has already been corroborated by certain witnesses. He left the scene because he was in fear for his safety and life,"" Blatt said. The attorney for Sloan dismissed that version of events. ""That's absurd,"" Shapiro said Tuesday. During Tuesday's arraignment, the initial judge assigned to the case, John Cheroske, recused himself because he had represented both victims in the case in his years as an attorney. Judge Ricardo Ocampo quickly took over the case. Knight's bail hearing was scheduled for next Monday. He is now being held in jail without bail. Knight founded the wildly successful Death Row Records in 1991, signing artists such as Snoop Doggy Dogg (since then known as Snoop Dogg and Snoop Lion) and Tupac Shakur. Knight was driving the car in which Shakur was a passenger when the rapper was shot to death in Las Vegas in 1996. Shortly afterward, Knight spent several years in prison for violating parole on assault and weapons convictions. That prison time -- along with Shakur's death, feuds between Knight and a number of rappers and desertions by Dr. Dre, Snoop and others -- contributed to the label's bankruptcy in 2006. In August, Knight and two other people were shot while inside a celebrity-filled Sunset Strip party hosted by singer Chris Brown on the eve of the MTV Video Music Awards.","Knight ""was being attacked and trying to get away from that attack,"" his attorney says .
