"George Osborne invoked Margaret Thatcher's warning that political parties could only be successful if they reflect modern society . George Osborne launched an emphatic defence of gay marriage yesterday, saying the Tories will not win the next election unless they drop their opposition to it. He urged the party to emulate US President Barack Obama  by appealing to young voters and women with a socially liberal message. But the Chancellor's intervention provoked anger on the Tory Right, with campaigners claiming that proposals to legalise gay marriage could cost the Conservatives more than a million votes and 30 seats. One MP said the 'social liberal values of Notting Hill don't translate well outside the M25', while a former Tory minister warned that Army chaplains could face the sack if they disagree with the plans. Writing in The Times, Mr Osborne said most voters support gay marriage and politicians should 'reflect the modern societies they aspire to lead'. He quoted Margaret Thatcher saying the Tories should respond to 'people and how they want to live their lives'. The Coalition has pledged to legalise gay marriage before 2015, but it is not part the Government's current legislative programme. However, Mr Osborne used  his article to argue that it is a  vital plank of Conservative re- election plans. He said the party should heed the lessons of Mr Obama's election success despite poor economic conditions. In a robust shot across the bows of . the Tory Right, Mr Osborne said voters on both sides of the Atlantic . want economic toughness and social liberalism. He added that Mr Obama sealed victory . once he started making the case that the deficit should be tackled and . showed that he 'was on the side of ordinary, hard- working voters'. But crucially, he said the Tories, . like Mr Obama's opponent Mitt Romney, could lose supporters who agree . with them on the economy if they are not in tune with them on social . issues as well. He wrote: 'President Obama's . high-profile endorsement of equal marriage for gay couples enthused . younger voters. But polls found that a majority of all Americans . supported him on the issue and voted for it in all four states that held . ballots.' US President Barack Obama used an ABC News interview in May this year to say he believed same-sex couples should be allowed to marry . Mr Osborne continued: 'I wouldn't . change the current abortion laws and I strongly support gay marriage on . principle. I am proud to be part of a government that will introduce a . Bill to allow gay marriage. 'It is worth reflecting that in . Britain, as in America, a clear majority of the public support gay . marriage, and an even bigger majority of women support it. 'That majority support is just as high in the North as it is the South, and it is equally high among all socio-economic groups. Former defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth has warned the Ministry of Defence that military chaplains could be sacked if they oppose gay marriage . 'Successful political parties reflect . the modern societies they aspire to lead. As Margaret Thatcher said in . the first sentence of her introduction to the 1979 Conservative election . manifesto: “The heart of politics is not political theory, it is people . and how they want to live their lives”.' The Coalition for Marriage, which . opposes gay marriage, dismissed Mr Osborne's claims and announced that . it will campaign in tomorrow's Corby by-election against a redefinition . of the institution. Colin Hart, the organisation's campaign director, . said: 'The PM and the Chancellor must stop misleading the public. The . polls actually show that a majority of voters do not support the . redefinition of marriage. 'It's time for senior politicians – . particularly Mr Cameron, Clegg and Osborne – to get a grip and start . talking about the issues that really matter, like reviving the economy, . not redefining marriage.' He highlighted a poll by the research . consultancy ComRes that found that redefining marriage could cost the . Tories up to 30 parliamentary seats and 1.1million votes. 'Ordinary . people in places like Corby want action on the economy and public . services, not meddling with marriage,' he said. Tory backbencher Stewart Jackson . said: 'The focus should be less on these social liberal obsessions  of . West London and more on  blue-collar issues like the cost of living, . mortgages and reducing taxes for families. 'The social liberal values of Notting Hill don't translate well outside the M25.' Former defence minister Sir Gerald . Howarth has written to Defence Secretary Philip Hammond warning that . military chaplains face being disciplined if the Government forces . through its plans. He wrote: 'Under the Government's . proposals if the definition of marriage is rewritten, then those . chaplains who maintain their support for the traditional/biblical . meaning could face disciplinary action and even dismissal.' The former minister also dismisses recent assurances from the Government that it can protect churches from prosecution. He said: 'The Government is keen to . assert that no clergy declining to offer a marriage service to . homosexuals will be subject to discrimination or penalty, an undertaking . ministers are in no position to give since the interpretation of any . new law will rest with the courts and, ultimately, the impertinent . European Court of Human Rights.'","Chancellor says Mitt Romney's defeat in race for the White House shows winning the economic argument is not enough .

"Finding an eight-stone rodent on the couch would see most people racing for the phone to dial pest control. But it's a daily occurrence for Melanie Typaldos, 57 and her husband Richard Loveman, 54, who share their home in Buda, Texas, with a giant capybara named Gary. Ms Typaldos adopted Gary after falling in love with the semi-aquatic mammals - the world's largest rodent - during a holiday in Venezuela, and she and her husband are so fond of their bizarre pet they even let him sleep in their bed. Scroll down for video . 'I can't imagine life without him': Melanie Typaldos and her husband Richard Loveman make room on the couch for their pet - an eight-stone capybara named Gary . 'Affectionate': The semi-aquatic mammal enjoys a swim with his owner's daughter, Coral Waters, at home in Buda, Texas . 'Athough some people might find it strange, it's really no different than having a dog or a cat,' said Ms Typaldos, who installed a pool in her backyard for Gary to cool off in. 'Gary is really very smart and he's very affectionate. 'He comes when he's called and he likes to sleep with me,' she added. Unusual: The Texas couple even let rodent Gary, who weighs eight stone, sleep in their bed . Companionship: Gary keeps a close eye on Flopsy the cat and Ms Typaldos' pet tortoise at her Texas home . Ms Typaldos adopted the capybara from an owner who was no longer able to care for him, and said the cuddly eight-stone creature quickly became a part of the family. The 57-year-old even claims to have taught Gary to perform tricks. 'He learns tricks very quickly - faster than your typical dog would,' she said. 'He knows how to shake, how to turn in a circle, how to stand up on his hind legs and how to jump up on things on command.' Hitching a ride: Melanie, who adopted Gary from an owner who could no longer care for him, said having a capybara was not so different from owning a dog or a cat . In their natural habitat, capybaras spend most of their time in the water - so Melanie installed a giant pool in her garden to make Gary feel at home. He was also introduced to the animal lover's menagerie of other pets; including a horse, rabbits tortoises, dogs and a cat. She said: 'He gets on well with the other animals, although he likes to chase the rabbits for fun. 'He . does sometimes get angry with the tortoises because he thinks they . invade his space and there is nothing he can do about it.' Taking a dip: Gary enjoys a swim in a rubber ring at owner Melanie Typaldos' home in Buda, Texas . 'Companionship': Ms Typaldos said she fell in love with Gary the capybara and that he quickly became part of the family . Friendly: Gary's owners say he gets along well with other animals - including Boston Terrier puppy Juju . Pampered: Melanie and her husband Richard Loveman give Gary a bit of attention on the couch at their Texas home . Part of the family: Gary is seen left ready for a trip in the car, and right enjoying a cuddle with Flopsy the cat . Nap time: Gary's owner adopted him after falling in love with capybara's during a trip to Venezuela . Ms Typaldos takes Gary, who lives on a diet of grass, to visit pupils at schools around Buda to help educate the children about different animals. She said: 'Most people don't know what a capybara is but as soon as they see him, they want to come pet him and feed him treats. 'He loves the attention,' she added. Sizeable: The capybara is the largest rodent in the world - followed by the beaver and the porcupine . Pals: Mr Loveman rests his head against Gary in the back of the car on an outing in Buda . Firm friends: Gary the capybara nuzzles with Juju the boston terrier in Ms Typaldos back garden in Texas . Despite her affection for her pet, Ms Typaldos warned that capybaras were not your standard domestic pet. 'Capybaras can be quite aggressive sometimes and their teeth are very, very sharp,' she said. 'Gary is not at all aggressive, but a capybara bite can be pretty serious.' But she added of Gary: 'He gives you that same sort of companionship and affection that other animals do - I can't imagine life without him.'","Melanie Typaldos, 57, shares her home with a giant rodent named Gary .

"For more than a decade there have been sightings of unusual high-speed watercraft patrolling up and down the Columbia River between Portland, Oregon and Vancouver in Canada. The vessels belong to the Navy SEALs and are part of an ongoing project called Sealion, which stands for SEAL (Sea Air Land Commandos)  Insertion, Observation and Neutralization. Despite being in existence for more than a decade, the project remains shrouded in mystery, although over the years some information has been discovered. For more than a decade there have been sightings of unusual high-speed watercraft on the Columbia River, the vessels belong to the Navy SEALs and are part of an ongoing project called Sealion . Sealion is an experiment between the US Navy's Surface Warfare Command and the Naval Special Warfare Command. Launched in 2000, the brief was to develop a high-speed, low observable/low radar signature craft that could operate in the littorals i.e. the part of sea close to shore. The Navy's intention was to use the craft as a medium-range method of transporting SEALs without appearing on the enemy's radar. Sealion is operationally controlled by Naval Special Warfare Group (NSWG) 4 at Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek, Va, reports FoxtrotAlpha. The Navy's intention was to use the craft as a medium-range method of transporting SEALs without being appearing on the enemy's radar . Launched in 2000, the Sealion brief was to develop a high-speed, low observable/low radar signature craft that could operate in the littorals i.e. the part of sea close to shore . ‘The purpose of the project was to build a demonstration craft to explore the use of technology that may have future application in the Global War on Terrorism,’ said Capt. Evin H. Thompson, one-time commander of NSWG 4, speaking about the original version of the craft. Known simply as Sealion, it measured 71 feet and required a crew of one or two sailors to operate. It was capable of 40 knots under normal conditions and no less than 30 knots in sea states as high as level five. The original Sealion, cost $9 million and was delivered in 2003 when a demonstration is understood to have taken place. However the boat was never put into production and instead the decision was taken to develop the slightly more advanced Sealion ll. Sealion is operationally controlled by Naval Special Warfare Group (NSWG) 4 at Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek, Va, . A rear opening garage-like door would allow for deployment and recovery of these craft with relative ease and without compromising the boat's stealth capabilities for more than a short period of time . It appears to have been a refinement of the original design and is rumored to have offered an even lower radar cross section than its predecessor, but was also big enough to carry an unspecified number of SEALs and a modular mission payload. It also required just a single crewman to operate. The state-of-the-art electronics suite included a retractable FLIR turret, communications array and radar, along with a highly automated command and control system. According to Thompson, NSWG 4 was looking at Sealion II as a potential platform for weapons systems and intelligence collection. A rear opening garage-like door would allow for deployment and recovery of these craft with relative ease and without compromising the boat's stealth capabilities for more than a short period of time. Despite being in existence for more than a decade, the Sealion project remains surrounded in mystery, although over the years some information has been disclosed . Another supposed benefit of the Sealion ll was that it could be used to sneak up on a moving target, such as a large ship. Without showing up on its radar would clearly offer a huge advantage over boats normally used for missions which do not feature a high degree of 'low observable' technology. It isn't clear if the Sealion ll has ever become even semi-operational within the Navy, but the program appears to remains active because new boats keep appearing on the Columbia year after year. Even boaters who have spotted a Sealion visually as it is semi-submerged say that it does not show up on their commercial grade radars, which is at least some proof to the Sealion's cloaking capabilities.

Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said he is deeply concerned about Iraq's . rapidly deteriorating stability, including reports of mass summary . executions. Those atrocities and terrorist attacks . are taking place as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, or ISIS, . an Al Qaeda-inspired Sunni Muslim militant group, looks to link areas . under its control on both sides of the Iraq-Syria border. It came as video emerged reportedly . showing ISIS militants carrying out the systematic execution of dozens . of prisoners in Syria. Taking no prisoners: Footage posted on YouTube appears to show ISIS militants carrying out summary executions on dozens of captured soldiers in Syria . The U.N. said forces allied . with ISIL had almost certainly committed war crimes by executing . hundreds of non-combatant men in Iraq over the past five days. ISIS . seeks a caliphate ruled on medieval Sunni Muslim precepts in Iraq and . Syria, fighting against both Iraq's Maliki and Syria's Bashar al-Assad. It . considers Shiites heretics as deserving of death and has boasted of . massacring hundreds of Iraqi troops who surrendered to it last week. 'There . is a real risk of further sectarian violence on a massive scale, within . Iraq and beyond its borders,' Ban told reporters. He . said all Iraqi leaders - political, military, religious and community - . must 'ensure that their followers avoid acts of reprisal' and together . head off more conflict. On brink of sectarian war: The UN said atrocities are taking place as ISIS looks to link areas under its control on both sides of the Iraq-Syria border . He said he has been urging Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's Shiite-led government to take a more inclusive approach. 'The . Iraqi government should have one state. Whether it is Sunni, Shiite or . Kurds, they should be able to harmoniously live together,' Ban said. 'I . hope that with the strong support of regional countries and the . international community in a broader sense, we will be able to help the . Iraq government first of all to restore peace and stability in their . country.' Ban said governments that allow human right rights abuses become 'breeding grounds for extremism and terrorism.' Interntional condemnation heightened today as the UN published a report on the situation. Vitit Muntarbhorn, an international law expert who took part in the inquiry, said: 'We predicted a long time ago the dangers of spillover both ways, which is now becoming a regional spillover. We are possibly on the cusp of a regional war and that is something we're very concerned about.' UN human rights chief Navi Pillay said on Monday forces allied with ISIS in northern Iraq had almost certainly committed war crimes by executing hundreds of non-combatant men over the past five days. Sectarian violence: The executions in Syria resemble those in Iraq, above, which the UN has warned could contribute to an all-out regional war . Brutal: UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon urged all sections of Iraqi society to work together to prevent disaster . A report presented on Tuesday to the UN Human Rights Council said foreign Sunni jihadi militants and funds had poured into Syria where rebel factions including ISIS were wantonly abusing civilians in zones they controlled. 'A regional war in the Middle East draws ever closer. Events in neighbouring Iraq will have violent repercussions for Syria,' the investigators' report said. 'Growing numbers of radical fighters are targeting not only Sunni (Muslim) communities under their control but also minority communities including the Shi'ites, Alawites, Christians, Armenians, Druze and Kurds,' it said of Syria. Its reference to Sunni militants targeting Sunni civilians involved forceful pressure on Sunni women to comply with sharia (Islamic religious law) and acts of revenge against Sunnis who had served in the Syrian government.

"Nearly half of all Americans lack economic security and seriously struggle to make ends meet, a report has found. A staggering 45 per cent of U.S. citizens live above the federal poverty threshold - but do not have enough money to cover their housing, food, healthcare and other basic expenses. It breaks down to 39 per cent of all adults and 55 per cent of all children. Destitute: Nearly half of all Americans lack economic security and seriously struggle to make ends meet, a report has found (stock photo) 'This is a wake-up call for Congress, for our state policy-makers, really for all of us,' said Donna Addkison, President and CEO of advocacy group Wider Opportunities for Women's survey, which carried out the survey. She added: 'Nearly half of our nation's families cannot cover the costs of basic expenses even when they do have a job. 'Under these conditions, cuts to unemployment insurance and other programmes families are relying on right now would push them from crisis to catastrophe.' The WOW survey compared 2009 pre-tax incomes to a budget of basic and essential monthly expenses for various families that it developed along with researchers at Washington University. For example, in a budget for a family of one worker, it put housing expenses at $688 and food at $244. In a family of two workers with two young children, it assumed housing would cost $821 per month and food $707 a month. It did not include non-essentials such as holidays, recreation, hobbies, college tuition, and other common expenses of the middle class. A congressional effort to find $1.2 trillion in spending cuts over 10 years failed on Monday, raising fears that emergency benefits for the long-term unemployed would not be extended when they expire next month. Other social programmes including Medicare are also under threat as lawmakers seek to slash the nation's huge debt. Some economists said that while they agreed the debt had to be reduced, targeting programmes that helped the low income group survive the harsh economic environment was not the correct path to take. 'I am in favour of austerity, but not in this area,' said Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research in New York. 'This is the only austerity going on and this is hitting the long-term unemployed. It's not improving the long-term budget situation anyway.' Currently, the poverty threshold for the United States is an annual income of $22,314 for a family of four. A little more than 15 per cent of the country lives at or below that level, and the group wanted to look at the remainder, 'many of whom live on the edge and are chronically at risk of financial crisis or falling into poverty'. More than four out of 10 adult women live in households that cannot cover those basic expenses, slightly more than the proportion of men, 37 per cent. That may be because in 2009 women's median earnings were 70 per cent of men's median earnings, the group said. More than 60 percent of single women live in economic insecurity, it added. 'While married women are more likely to have economic security than unmarried women, much of the stability is attained through a husband's earnings or other household income,' the group reported, which can put those women in economic jeopardy if their husbands die or lose their job or if the couple divorces. The group also found 'that full-time work fails to provide economic security for 25 per cent of adult workers,' because of stagnating and falling wages over the last decade. 'A chief cause of economic insecurity is 1970s level wages that fail to cover modern expenses,' it said. While households with two full-time workers can help boost a family's economic security, 22 per cent of adults with children who work full-time and have a partner who also has a full-time job cannot cover basic needs. At the same time, 21 per cent of homes headed by a college graduate lack economic security. 'In the past, threats to economic security were supposedly clear - dropping out of high school, being a single parent or having a large family. In today's economy, we cannot assume we know who lacks security,' it said.",45% of U.S. citizens don't have enough money to cover basic expenses .

But he said the local rebels had yet to give permission for the train to set off. The rebels responded by suggesting the pro-Western Ukrainian government was delaying the train’s departure, and arguing they could do nothing until the arrival of the international experts pledged by several countries to help determine what and who caused the crash.

"Will the Duchess breastfeed her son? Recent Royal tradition – and her own very modern outlook – suggest she will. Princess Diana insisted on breastfeeding both William and Harry. The Queen Mother breastfed the Queen following her birth in 1926, and the Queen continued the practice with each of her four children. However, a case of the measles forced her to wean Prince Charles when he was less than two months old. And the glamorous Princess Margaret found the act rather distasteful and chose to feed both her children, David and Sarah, by bottle. Will she? Won't she? Recent Royal tradition - and her own very modern outlook - suggest the Duchess of Cambridge will choose to breastfed her new baby son. But in the past many Royal mothers chose not to . Indeed, it’s only in the last century that the Royals have even considered natural feeding as an option. Despite having nine children, Queen Victoria found the idea disgusting and said breastfeeding was the ‘ruin’ of refined ladies. It was perhaps unsurprising that when her daughters Vicky and Alice decided they wanted to follow the changing times and suckle their own babies, they tried to keep it a secret from their mother. When she learned about it, Queen . Victoria was furious, even writing to Princess Alice to tell her that . she had named one of her dairy cows after her. Against it: Despite having nine children, Queen Victoria found the idea of breastfeeding disgusting and said it was the 'ruin' of refined ladies . Indeed, for centuries, breastfeeding was typically shunned by noblewomen, with royal babies being handed over to wet nurses almost as soon as the cord was cut. By the 11th century in most royal palaces across Europe, there was usually a team of lactating wet nurses on hand to make sure a royal baby could be fed on demand while the Queen resumed her duties. The choice of wet nurse was an important one as it was believed that her milk could influence a baby’s temperament. It meant that the most suitable wet nurses were often handpicked from the aristocracy, although women from wealthy families were a good second option. The future James I was breastfed by Lady Reres, his mother’s lady-in-waiting, while the youngest daughter of Charles I was fed by Lady Dalkeith in 1644. Traditionally, boys spent longer being breastfed than their sisters – often for a  couple of years – as they were considered to be more dependent and fussy. According to historians, the last British monarch to be suckled by a wet nurse was George VI, the Queen’s father, who was born in 1895. Many studies show the benefits to mother and child of breastfeeding. The latest indicates it protects babies against developing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Researchers at Tel Aviv University, Israel, said children who were bottle fed at three months were three times more likely to have ADHD than those who were breastfed.","Princess Diana, the Queen and the Queen mother all breastfed .

The stills, taken from the skies over the village of Grabovo in eastern Ukraine, show the scorched earth at the point of impact and gives an idea of how much more severe the devastation could have been had it come down in the nearby family homes. Grabovo is controlled by pro-Russian rebels, widely suspected of shooting the plane out of the sky on Thursday afternoon. The pictures emerged as the train carrying the bodies of all of the victims of Flight MH17 finally set off after four days in situ. Scroll down for videos . In this photo provided by Airbus DS/AllSource Analysis, a satellite image shows the primary crash site (left), of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 located near Hrabove, eastern Ukraine. Four days after Flight 17 was shot out of the sky, international investigators still have had only limited access to the crash site . This image shows just how close the crash site was to civilian homes in the twon of Grabove, Ukraine . It comes amid uproar over the treatment of the corpses, which have lain in the baking summer heat since Thursday. Finally, after repeated calls from leaders to speed up the chaotic clean-up operation, officials at the site in eastern Ukraine have agreed to hand over the bodies to the Dutch at 7pm today. The train pulled away from a station in Torez, nine miles from the rebel-held field where the Malaysia Airlines flight was shot down by a missile. Today President Barack Obama rebuked Russian President Vladmir Putin today for not using his influence to stop Russian backed separatists in Ukraine from 'tampering' with evidence at the site of the MH17 crash. Speaking from South Lawn of the White House, the U.S. president said it's Putin's 'responsibility' to compel the rebels to cease removing bodies from the area and allow investigators to have 'immediate and full access' to the site so they can conduct a thorough investigation. 'That's the least that we can do. That's the least that dignity demands,' he said. Personnel from the Ukrainian Emergencies Ministry load the bodies of victims of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 into a truck at the crash site today .

Members of Ukraine's emergency services put on protective suits as they prepare to unload newly retrieved bodies into a refrigerated train in Torez, eastern Ukraine . 'All of this goes to say, ""what have they got to hide?"" Obama asked at one point in his remarks. 'This is an insult to those who have lost loved ones.' Reports claim it is heading for the rebel-held town of Ilovaysk, 50 miles west of Torez.The United Nations Security Council will later today vote on a resolution tabled by the UK and Australia demanding 'safe, full and unfettered access' to the crash site for international investigators and for the bodies of victims - many of which are currently being held in refrigerated train carriages - to be handled with respect and dignity. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond will tomorrow meet EU counterparts in Brussels at a meeting in which the UK hopes that extended sanctions on specific Russian businesses, organisations and individuals, agreed last week and due to come into force by the end of the month, will be brought forward for immediate implementation. Mr Hammond and other EU foreign ministers will have an opportunity to talk to representatives of the Malaysian Government at a meeting with the Asean economic bloc in Brussels on Wednesday. Business as usual: Russian President Vladimir Putin  visiting the Progress State Research and Production Rocket Space Center, also known as TsSKB-Progress, in Samara, Russia, today . Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, sits in an aircraft cockpit today. Putin has lambasted those who use the downing of a passenger jet in eastern Ukraine for 'mercenary objectives' The UK also wants discussion tomorrow on potential 'Tier 3' sanctions on wider sectors of the Russian economy, which could cover areas such as financial services, trade and defence co-operation and energy exports. French arms sales and German dependence on Russian fossil fuels have been seen as possible barriers to tougher measures, but Britain will argue that the whole union must share the burden. U.S. President Barack Obama criticised Russia over access to the site at the White House today . Mr Cameron told MPs that, as well as speaking by phone with Mr Putin, he had discussed the MH17 tragedy in the last few days with German chancellor Angela Merkel, French president Francois Hollande and the leaders of the Netherlands, Malaysia, Poland and Australia. He said that for too long there had been 'reluctance' on the part of some European nations to face up to the implications of the unrest in eastern Ukraine. And he said: 'It is time to make our power, influence and resources felt. If Russia does not change course then we must be clear Europe must keep increasing the pressure: Russia cannot expect to continue enjoying access to European markets, European capital, European knowledge and technical expertise while she fuels conflict in one of Europe's neighbours. 'We must do what is necessary to stand up to Russia and put an end to the conflict in Ukraine before any more innocent lives are lost.' Mr Cameron said: 'President Putin faces a clear choice in how he decides to respond to this appalling tragedy. I hope he will use this moment to find a path out of this festering and dangerous crisis by ending Russia's support for the separatists. 'If he does not change his approach to Ukraine in this then Europe and the West must fundamentally change our approach to Russia. 'Those of us in Europe should not need to be reminded of the consequences of turning a blind eye when big countries bully smaller countries. 'We should not shrink from standing up for the principles that govern conduct between independent nations in Europe and which ultimately keep the peace on our continent.' Mr Cameron was this afternoon chairing a meeting of the National Security Council to discuss the Malaysia Airlines crash, as well as the latest situation in Gaza. Chancellor George Osborne said the UK was prepared to take an 'economic hit' in order to put pressure on Moscow over its involvement in the Ukraine crisis. 'This is about living in a world where international borders are respected, where commercial airliners are not shot down,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'It is absolutely in Britain's national economic interest that that is the case. Of course any sanctions will have an economic impact, and we are prepared to undertake further sanctions.","Pictures show the full scale of the devastation wrought by the plane crash in eastern Ukraine on Thursday .

"Mouths on Capitol Hill were agape Friday as MailOnline told congressional staffers that President Barack Obama's recent one-night stay in Brussels cost taxpayers more than $2.9 million – and that's just for hotel space and rental vehicles. The amount covered Obama's March 25-26 stay in Belgium's capital, plus two weeks of work by his advance team before the president participated in a NATO and EU summit and a tour of the Flanders Field Cemetery. The Weekly Standard first reported on a single requisition for lodging in Brussels at a hotel called 'The Hotel,' costing an estimated $1.52 million. MailOnline has found two additional requisitions, covering more than $396,000 at a Crowne Plaza hotel and $1.05 million in expenses for 'vehicle rentals.' 'The best view over Brussels ... even from the sauna': Obama was in the lap of luxury for one night, and taxpayers chipped in for millions . No generic lodging: 'The Hotel' is the creme-de-la-creme of Belgium's four-star hotels . Champagne? Even the ordinary rooms at 'The Hotel' include bubbly and walk-in 'rain' showers; imagine what the presidential suite is like! The cars were requisitioned from Modern Car, a Brussels company that specializes in luxury limousines. 'Are you kidding me?' asked a senior aide to one Republican member of the House Appropriations Committee. 'The president is going to have to get used to flying commercial some day. I bet taxpayers wish that cay came sooner.' 'Wow, that seems disgusting, doesn't it?' said a GOP committee staffer elsewhere on Capitol Hill. 'I know we need to protect the president, but at some point you have to assume we spent a fraction as much to shuttle JFK around and protect him.' 'And why do nearly 1,000 people have to go on the trip? Are there really that many Secret Service agents and clipboard-holders? This is a testament to why government needs to shrink down and start treating taxpayers with respect.' Neither aide would agree to be named. A search Friday on Expedia.com found that rooms at 'The Hotel' in Brussels can be had for $320 per night on upcoming Tuesdays, the same weekday Obama spent the night there. The presidential suite presumably costs far more. But even the top-tier rooms for ordinary travelers feature 46-inch LED TVs, private fridges with complimentary champagne and wine, and walk-in rain showers. Including both 'The Hotel' and the Crowne Plaza, the brief stop in Brussels required exclusive use of 387 hotel rooms and 143 rental cars, according to federal government procurement documents. Obama arrived in Brussels on the second leg of a four-nation tour that included stops in The Netherlands, Italy and Saudi Arabia . The president spent his 24 hours in Brussels at UN and NATO summits, touring Flanders Field Cemetery, and sleeping in the lap of luxury . Obama's 'Beast' limo is a one-of-a-kind stretch Cadillac with armor plating on every surface; he took it with him to Europe and the Middle East in March . The rental cars formed a formidable motorcade in Brussels whenever Obama moved from event to event. Modern Car features mostly Mercedez-Benz, BMW and Audi sedans. A pool reporter traveling in the phalanx of vehicles noted on March 26 as Obama departed the city that '[t]he streets were mostly blocked off and deserted, though some small pockets of onlookers waited behind police barricades to see POTUS drive by.' According to the U.S. Air Force, it now costs $228,288 per hour to fly the president's customized Boeing 747. That hourly expense is up 27 per cent since Obama took office. The Obama entourage, which some reports claimed was 900-strong, arrived in three planes which hauled an additional 45 vehicles – including the president's armored Cadillac limousine known in the White House as 'The Beast.' The Guardian reported that Belgium's cost for providing security and planning surrounding the president's 24 hours stay was at least $10.4 million.","The U.S. president spent a single night in Belgium's capital, but taxpayers of both countries are on the hook for millions .

"Mother-of-two is five months pregnant with, she claims, her rapist's child and is demanding abortion . This is the pregnant rape victim who shot and decapitated her attacker then left his severed head in the square of her local village. Nevin Yildirim, 26, is now awaiting trial after murdering the man in her home in Yalvac, south-west Turkey last week. The mother-of-two is five months pregnant with, she claims, her rapist's child. Revenge: Nevin Yildirim (left) shot and decapitated Nurettin Gider (right), who she claims had repeatedly raped her, and then left his severed head in her village square in Turkey . Grisly end: Yildirim carried Gider's head, which was dripping blood, by the hair to the village square and then dumped it in front of shocked onlookers . She is demanding authorities let her have an abortion even though she is four weeks beyond Turkey's ten-week termination limit. Yildirim . said the man, Nurettin Gider, began assaulting her a few days after her . husband left home in January to work a seasonal job in another town. She claims he threatened her with a gun and said he would kill her children, aged two and six, if she did not keep silent, reports CNN.com. The rapes continued over the next eight months until August 28, when Yildirim decided she had had enough. On . that day she shot Gider after he had climbed up the back wall of her . house and then shot him again when he reached for his gun. She said: 'I chased him. He fell on the ground. He started swearing at me. 'I shot his sexual organ this time. He became quiet. I knew he was dead. I then cut his head off.' In total, Yildirim . shot him ten times, including several times in his groin region. He was . also reportedly stabbed in the abdomen after he was shot. She then carried his head, which was dripping blood, by the hair to the village square at Yalvac, onlookers said. Investigation: Police officers stand outside Yildirim's home, where the murder took place . In custody: Yildirim is led into court for a preliminary hearing earlier this week . Horrific: The man's severed head was dumped in the centre of the town of Yalvac . Speaking to shocked men sitting outside a coffee house, she said: 'Don't talk behind my back, don't play with my honour. Here is the head of the man who played with my honour.' Video footage of Gider's head on the ground was captured by local broadcaster DHA, who arrived at the scene before police. It is thought the rapist was blackmailing Yildirim. She said he had taken nude photos of her while pregnant after sneaking into her bedroom at night. He threatened to send them to her parents unless she continued sleeping with him, she said. 'He kept saying that he would tell everyone about the rape,' Yildirim reportedly said during her testimony. 'My daughter will start school this year. Everyone would have insulted my children. Now no one can. 'I saved my honour. They will now call children the kids of the woman who saved her honour.' According to a source quoted by CNN, Yildirim said: 'I thought of reporting him to military police and to the district attorney, but this was going to mark me as a scorned woman. 'Since I was going to get a bad reputation I decided to clean my honor and acted on killing him. I thought of suicide a lot but couldn't do it.' Womens' groups in Turkey have praised Yildirim as a heroine. Yildirim has even said she is prepared to die as long as she is allowed to have the abortion. Father-of-two Gider, 35, was married to an aunt of Yildirim's husband.","Nevin Yildirim, 26, is now awaiting trial after murdering rapist in her home in south-west Turkey last week .

"A collection of 150 love letters discovered in an attic after being hidden for almost a century document the heartwarming story of a World War One romance between two sweethearts. Young soldier Henry Coulter, who signed up with the 17th (Leeds) Battalion West Yorkshire Regiment in the spring of 1915, wrote dozens of love letters to his girlfriend Lucy Townend, signing them 'Yours for Eternity, Henry'. Tragically, their blossoming love story ended early, as on October 10, 1916, Henry - who by then had been promoted to Corporal - was wounded in a shell blast in France and died from his injuries a few days later. Henry Coulter, who signed up with the 17th (Leeds) Battalion West Yorkshire Regiment in the spring of 1915, wrote dozens of love letters to his girlfriend Lucy Townend (pictured), signing them 'Yours for Eternity, Henry' Lucy's final letter to him was returned unopened - becoming one of 150 she kept hidden away for decades until her death in 1982. They were re-discovered hidden in a tin box in the attic of her home in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, by a new owner. In one letter, Henry tells Lucy: 'Whenever I think of home or you, it always makes tears come into my eyes and I am not the only one here by a long way. 'You would be surprised to see some of our most toughest of fellows break down when we talk about home. But there, this is to be a cheerful letter not a funeral.' In another letter, young Henry enclosed a brooch, telling Lucy: 'I hope you will like it and wear it for me my darling. 'It will be a constant reminder that someone whom you love very dearly is trying his level best to do his best for King and Country.' John Rumsby (pictured) with the World War I love letters that have been discovered . After the letters were found they were passed to local historian and former museum curator John Rumsby. He said: 'A friend of my daughter was exploring her newly-purchased house in Birkby, Huddersfield, and in the attic she found a rusty tin box. 'Inside was a bundle of about 150 letters and postcards, in their original envelopes. 'A quick look at some of the contents revealed them to be the correspondence between a Huddersfield soldier and his sweetheart, written between 1914 and 1916. One of the letters discovered in an attic after being hidden for almost a century . 'The soldier, Henry Coulter, lived in Marsh, Huddersfield, and his girlfriend, Lucy Townend, lived in the house where the letters were found. 'Most of the letters were written whilst Henry was in training in various camps in England. Only the last few were sent whilst he was on active service in France. 'The letters contain no great military revelations: they were written to entertain and reassure his sweetheart, not to satisfy future military historians. 'He was much more concerned with expressing his love, in often painfully intimate terms, for his 'Beauty,' Lucy, whom he refers to several times as his future wife. The blossoming love story ended early, as on October 10, 1916, Henry - who by then had been promoted to Corporal - was wounded in a shell blast in France and died from his injuries . 'He signs most of his letters ""Yours for Eternity, Henry"".' The poignant story will be told in a book due to be published later this year by the Huddersfield Local History Society to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of the Great War. Mr Rumsby, a former museum curator, said: 'Up until August 1914, Henry would not have had a clue about the possibility of becoming a soldier - he was probably thinking of a life with Lucy. Mr Rumsby said: 'It's sad, knowing what happened, to read about the joy of two young people enjoying life' 'All of a sudden people were joining up and I think he had difficulty joining up because he was rather short. You had to be at least 5ft 3in to join the Army, so he didn't join until the spring of 1915 when he got in a Leeds Bantams battalion after they relaxed the height restrictions.' In one letter, Henry makes a joke about his height in one of several comic monologues he penned himself. 'There are several monologues which are quite witty. There are also some quite funny little jokes. He also teases his girlfriend and she teases him back about her becoming a conductor on the trams.' Her final letter to Henry was returned with a note on the envelope which simply, heartbreakingly, said: 'Died in hospital before letter received.' 'One hopes that she had already heard from Henry's father before she received that,' says Mr Rumsby. It is thought that Henry had hoped to marry his sweetheart on his return from France - as he had sent her a ring gauge so she could tell him her wedding finger measurement. Lucy got married in 1924 and had two children but it is apparent that she never forgot about her first love. 'It's sad, knowing what happened, to read about the joy of two young people enjoying life,' the historian said. 'The letters end in 1916 and they were wrapped in a newspaper reporting his death.' He added that the story was that of the courtship of two typical working class people. 'They seem to have gone to the same church together - Gledholt Methodist - and enjoyed going to the Pictures and had their favourite stars like Gladys Cooper and Charlie Chaplin, which they talked about in the letters.' Henry had worked as a clerk in the tramways department and Lucy worked in a shoe shop in Huddersfield town centre. It is thought that Henry had hoped to marry his sweetheart on his return from France - as he had sent her a ring gauge so she could tell him her wedding finger measurement .

"Just as British children have been brought up with scary stories about the Loch Ness Monster, Japanese people know all about the Kappa - a slippery water demon from ancient folklore. The pond and river-dwelling monsters are typically depicted as human-like but with the scaly green or blue skin of a reptile and webbed feet. But unlike the Loch Ness Monster, believers claim to have found ‘proof’ of the creature’s existence - and bones purporting to be from the Kappa are going on show in Japan. Proof? Mummified remains (pictured) purporting to be from the Kappa - a scaly green water demon said to be around the same size as a child - are going on show in Japan . There are over 80 different names for the Kappa or 'river' child in Japan. Kappa are typically drawn to look a little like humans, and are said to be around the same size as a child. Their scaly skin varies in colour from yellow to blue. They are said to live in ponds and rivers in Japan and have webbed hands and feet, a beak, and a bald patch on their head. In some tales of ancient folklore, the patch must be kept wet when Kappa venture out of the water, because if it dries, they will lose their power or even die. In other stories, Kappa are seen as mischievous troublemakers, or they are wicked creatures capable of attacking women and even drowning people. Kappa are similar to Scottish Kelpies and Finnish Nakki, which are used to scare children about the dangers of water. Some people think the Kappa legends are based upon the Japanese giant salamander, which is around the same size and has been known to grab prey using its formidable jaws. In Japanese folklore, the child-sized Kappa, or ‘river child’ occasionally jumps out of its watery lair to pull pranks, as well as attacking women. Some tales even claim the Kappa pulls people into the water to drown them. The colour, shape and features of the monster vary according to differing illustrations of the monster. It is thought the creature is similar to the Scottish ‘Kelpie,’ Scandinavian Nakki and other such monsters, which have been used over the years to warn children about the dangers of playing near water. Some people in Japan think the legend of the Kappa might be based upon the Japanese giant salamander, or ‘hanzaki’, which is an aggressive lizard that grabs its prey with its powerful jaws. But others . believe the Kappa is a specific creature, and there are signs near some . lakes in Japan warning people of their presence, RocketNews24 reported. The pond and river-dwelling monsters are typically depicted as human-like but with the scaly greeny blue skin of a reptile and webbed feet. These illustrations are from the mid-19th century .

The colour, shape and features of the monster vary according to differing illustrations (pictured) of the creature . Scientists . have not managed to confirm the existence of the creature, despite the . fact that numerous bones have been discovered that are said to belong to . the Kappa. One set of mummified remains, which seem to show a webbed hand is going on show for the first time at the Miyakonojo Shimazu Residence in Miyazaki prefecture on the island of Kyuushuu. The remains were given to the Miyakonijo Shimazu family after a ‘Kappa’ was shot on a riverbank in 1818. The foot measures around 3 inches (8cm) and the arm 5 inches (15cm), but no experts have claimed they are real, nor have any stated the bones are cobbled together to look monstrous. There are no plans to have them examined either. Smile!

"A baby-faced and self-proclaimed 'leader' of a gang has been jailed for torturing and terrorising a family. Ricky Purcell, a slight-looking 20-year-old, bragged that he was the 'Mr Big' behind a gang which carried out an attack on a couple’s flat in . Bodmin, Cornwall.

"America has been stunned after allegations of rape were made against Bill Cosby, pictured . The silence was excruciating. Bill Cosby and Camille, his wife of 50 years, were sitting in the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, surrounded by valuable works of African art from their private collection, lent for an exhibition. Moments earlier, the veteran American TV star had been basking in adulation. His generosity had been praised in Saturday’s interview for National Public Radio, America’s equivalent of Radio 4. Then the conversation took an ugly turn. ‘This question gives me no pleasure,’ began presenter Scott Simon, before asking Cosby about ‘serious accusations raised against you in recent days’. He didn’t need to spell out what they were. America has been stunned as several women have come forward to accuse Cosby of drugging and raping them in a series of incidents over several decades. Some allegedly took place when his sitcom The Cosby Show ruled U.S. TV and its star was held up as a model of wholesome family values. After a pause for 77-year-old Cosby to respond, Simon said: ‘You’re shaking your head . . . I have to ask the question — do you have a response to those charges?’ Simon tried twice more — and there were two more significant pauses — before he gave up and thanked the couple. Only Mrs Cosby, with whom the star has five children, thanked Simon in return. More was to come. On Tuesday, model and reality TV star Janice Dickinson accused Cosby of raping her, claiming she was attacked after a dinner at a Californian resort in 1982. Dickinson, 59, said Cosby gave her a pill and a glass of wine after she complained of stomach pains. The last thing she recalled before passing out, she alleged, was ‘Bill Cosby in a patchwork robe, dropping his robe and getting on top of me. And I remember a lot of pain’. Cosby’s lawyer has denied the allegations, calling her story ‘a complete lie’. But a day after Dickinson spoke out, Therese Serignese became the seventh woman to say publicly that Cosby sexually assaulted her. She said she was a starstruck 19-year-old when he chatted her up in a Las Vegas hotel, before giving her powerful tranquiliser pills. She alleged she came round to find they were having sex and accused him of ‘using his fame and power to come after people’s innocence’. Janice Dickinson, pictured,  is one of the latest celebrities to claim to have been drugged and raped by Cosby . Last night, the wife of Incredible Hulk actor Lou Ferrigno became the latest to publicly accuse Cosby of sexual assault. Carla Ferrigno claimed he grabbed her and forcibly kissed her when she was a teenager at his house after a double date in 1967, before she pushed him off. Millions of shocked fans and admirers are now watching the rapid disintegration of the reputation of the man once dubbed ‘America’s Dad’. Famous supporters, such as actress Whoopi Goldberg, have leapt to Cosby’s defence, but broadcasters are running scared. NBC has scrapped plans to make a new family sitcom featuring the comic and the internet streaming service Netflix has ‘postponed’ a comedy special starring him. The idea that such a prominent black role model, who tours the country lecturing African Americans on the importance of family, has feet of clay is almost too painful to contemplate in a racially divided America. Praised by presidents and courted by corporations, Cosby became indistinguishable from the man he played on The Cosby Show — Dr Cliff Huxtable, the loving patriarch of a middle-class family in New York. Cosby played Dr Cliff Huxtable in The Cosby Show between 1984 and 1992 on the NBC network . The NBC show, then the most popular on U.S. TV, ran from 1984 to 1992. In Britain, it was one of Channel 4’s most popular shows, ground-breaking in portraying black people in a happy family that was affluent and successful. That many Americans are hearing for the first time there may be a sinister side to Bill Cosby is testament, say some, to the power of his PR machine and the reluctance of the establishment to criticise him. For many of these accusations were first made nearly ten years ago. How could this have happened? One possible explanation lies in the way that interviewer Scott Simon was then hounded on social media for ‘ambushing’ Cosby. Many might wonder if it’s ever wrong to bring up repeated accusations of rape but, astonishingly, they have been barely mentioned over the years. Cosby has always rejected the claims against him, and has never been charged over them — let alone convicted. A new authorised biography didn’t refer to the allegations once, and nor did its review in the liberal New York Times, which praised it as ‘wonderfully thorough’. The same glaring omission was repeated in Cosby’s recent TV interviews to mark the upcoming 30th anniversary of The Cosby Show. Chatshow host Stephen Colbert instead gushed: ‘I’m going to say something controversial. I think you’re great.’ Several US journalists have said that editors spiked stories which addressed alleged sexual abuse . Even when, a few years ago, Cosby was promoting a campaign for better behaviour in the black community, interviewers including Oprah Winfrey didn’t deign to mention the subject. In recent days, several U.S. journalists admitted their attempts to publicise the allegations were spiked by editors who were, as one put it, ‘horrified at the prospect of taking down’ a ‘beloved figure and civil rights pioneer’. Footage has also emerged of an interview Cosby gave a few days ago, before the latest claims, to the Associated Press news agency, in which the star tried to shame the reporter for daring to bring up the allegations. ‘I don’t talk about it,’ he said. Some have suggested that fear of being labelled racist may have protected him. ‘I recognise Bill Cosby as a comedic genius, and black people — with good reason — don’t throw away our geniuses,’ said black academic Brittney Cooper. ‘Far too often, racism becomes an excuse for us not to confront sexism.’ If that was the case, it is no longer. Another alleged victim, Joan Tarshis — a former publicist to reggae star Bob Marley — also revealed herself this week. She says she was 19 when Cosby sexually assaulted her twice in 1969, while supposedly helping her get on in the industry. The first time, Ms Tarshis says she woke up on his couch after he had given her a drink. Cosby had raped her, she says, but her parents idolised the star and, ‘ashamed’, she kept quiet. On the second occasion, she claims she felt very dizzy after he gave her a drink and later awoke naked in his hotel suite bed. The accusers’ stories about being drugged and attacked are eerily similar. So too are their claims that they were ignored by the entertainment industry and discouraged from contacting the police. Ironically, the allegations have only gained traction because another popular African-American comic, Hannibal Buress, called Cosby a rapist in his act last month. Cosby’s publicist has said the star would not dignify ‘decade-old, discredited’ claims with a response. But sceptics challenged his claim that they were ‘discredited’. They were first made in 2005 by Andrea Constand, a university basketball star whom Cosby was mentoring. She said he had given her ‘herbal’ pills to ease her anxiety. Having drugged her, Cosby then molested her, she claimed. One alleged victim claimed Cosby, pictured, claimed he was 'scouting for talent' when he attacked her . Authorities chose not to file criminal charges. This week, Bruce Castor, the former prosecutor who investigated Cosby, said he had thought the star was ‘probably guilty’ but there had been insufficient evidence. But Constand went ahead with a civil lawsuit and 13 more women agreed to testify as anonymous witnesses, citing similar accusations. Cosby, who claimed his relationship with Constand had been consensual, settled out of court for an undisclosed amount in 2006. But three of the women who had agreed to testify soon came forward. Tamara Green, a California lawyer, said she had been assaulted in the Seventies, but only spoke out when she realised she wouldn’t be alone. She alleged she was a 19-year-old model when Cosby, whom she knew socially, gave her pills which he said would sort out a cold. When he offered to put her to bed, she said, she tried to fight him off but passed out. Cosby said he didn’t know her. Another former young model, Beth Ferrier, claimed she had a relationship with Cosby in the mid-Eighties which ended after he drugged her coffee and she awoke in a car with her clothes in disarray. The third woman, Barbara Bowman, had been an aspiring 17-year-old actress when her agent told her Cosby was ‘scouting for young talent’. She alleged the star had been a ‘monster’ who pinned her by her neck as he unbuckled his belt. Her thought, she has said, was: ‘Who’s gonna believe this? He was a powerful man. He was like the President.’ Cosby’s defenders insist the women are trying to cash in on his money and fame. Whoopi Goldberg has questioned why Ms Bowman didn’t go to police or get a hospital to confirm she had been raped. The U.S. statute of limitations on the alleged assaults ran out long ago, meaning Cosby cannot be tried or sued in any court. These women insist they have nothing to gain other than what they see as long-delayed justice.","Bill Cosby was quizzed about  abuse allegations on National Public Radio .

"Arsenal, Crystal Palace and Newcastle are monitoring developments with Swansea City striker Bafetimbi Gomis. The 29-year-old only joined Swansea in the summer but is growing frustrated with his lack of first-team starts as he alternates with Wilfried Bony. Gomis joined on a free transfer after his contract ran out with Lyon and is understood to have a release clause of £7million. Newcastle and Crystal Palace are monitoring developments with Swansea City striker Bafetimbi Gomis . Gomis, who scored against Arsenal in Swansea's 2-1 win earlier this month, is also interesting the Gunners . Arsenal manager Wenger is still keen to add another goalscorer to his squad. Gomis scored the winner against Arsenal, his first Premier League goal, barely a minute after coming on as a substitute against them earlier this month. Gomis wants regular first-team football but is reluctant to take a perceived step down. He has reservations about joining Palace hence manager Neil Warnock is lining up a fresh bid for Sunderland's Connor Wickham. A move to either Newcastle or Arsenal has obvious appeal for Gomis however. Swansea are in the market for another striker. They have tied Bony down to an improved contract but the Ivory Coast international is due to join up with his country for the Africa Cup of Nations from January 17 to February 8.

"A seasoned police officer has been terminated for repeatedly punching a woman in the head with a closed fist at a traffic stop. Utah Highway Patrol Sergeant Andrew Davenport pulled over 60-year-old Darla Wright after a police chase through Ogden in August, 2010.

"Tortured: Celeste Fronsman, 29, was found at the side of an Ohio road with visible burns, and the passerby who discovered her moaning could tell she had been raped . A woman was found naked and burned with a rope wrapped around her neck after she was raped and tortured before being left for dead at the side of a rural Ohio road. Celeste Fronsman was found by a passerby around 8.30am on Sunday who immediately called police after spotting the moaning woman.

"National Grid chief executive Steven Holliday said emergency measures are in place across Britain to avoid blackouts this winter . Emergency measures are needed to ensure Britain avoids blackouts this winter, the National Grid boss has admitted. Chief executive Steven Holliday said old power stations could be brought out of mothballs to supply extra energy. A number of coal-fired power stations have been shut to satisfy EU targets for cutting greenhouse gases. Four nuclear plants have closed unexpectedly for repairs – although Mr Holliday said two may be ready by the end of the year. The result is the total amount of electricity that can be supplied could be just 5 per cent greater than demand from consumers. National Grid has commissioned firms to bring mothballed power plants back into operation, and will pay manufacturers to turn off machines on peak afternoons. Some £75million has been set aside for this over the next two winters, money that will be added to customers' bills. Mr Holliday said: ‘Margins are tighter than they were last winter, which were tighter than they were the year before. The reality is that a lot of our power stations are old. 'We are taking a lot of coal fired stations off and we need to build a lot of new generation capacity in the UK.’ He said: ‘A number of generators in the UK have been retiring and shutting and we have had a number of operational issues in plants around the UK. Different power stations are – at the moment – unavailable to us. ‘We are just taking the right steps to make sure we know we have got the capacity to balance supply and demand this winter.’ Mr Holliday said there is good reason to believe that nuclear power stations at Heysham and Hartlepool, which are currently shut down for safety checks and repairs, will come back on line by the end of the year, which will ease the problem. But, he said: ‘We are making sure that we have commercial arrangements in place with generators that have shut down at the moment and are not available to us, to potentially come back on line and support the system if we get a very cold, sharp winter. ‘This is about trying to manage the coldest, darkest day of the year not average demand.’ Mr Holliday, who was speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, said National Grid is a ‘long long way’ from the need to have a conversation about whose lights would have to be turned off. ‘We are just making sure that we have back up supplies in a prudent way, so that we can see ourselves through a cold winter.’ Mr Holliday said the measures will prevent the lights going out, adding: ‘There are lots of tools available to us. We are being very prudent, very careful, but I’m confident that with these tools we will be able to balance supply and demand this winter.’ A number of coal-fired power stations, pictured, have been shut to satisfy EU targets for cutting greenhouse gases while four nuclear plants have closed unexpectedly for repairs (file pic) He said the Government passed a new Energy Act last year which has created a series of incentives to encourage energy companies to build the power stations, including nuclear and wind farms, that will supply needed electricity in the future. But it raises the spectre of 1970s-style blackouts. The British Chambers of Commerce said managers had ‘failed to plan adequately’. Big business argue the energy crunch is a damning indictment of the way the nation’s electricity supply system has been managed by successive governments and regulators. Director of the Energy Intensive Users Group, Jeremy Nicholson, said: ‘This can’ t be sustainable way of managing the energy system. Industry has to have access to secure power supplies. ‘How are we supposed to expect investment to continue into this country if we are in danger of moving toward having Third World levels of reliability for power? The British Chambers of Commerce said radical action is needed to ensure homes and businesses have all the power they need. Dr Adam Marshall, its executive director of policy and external affairs, said: ‘For too long, the UK has failed to plan adequately to guarantee the energy supplies required for our economy, businesses and consumers.’","Coal-fired  stations were shut to meet EU targets on greenhouse emissions .

"Britain needs to combat ‘monstrous’ Islamic State fundamentalists before they bring ‘mayhem on our own streets’ David Cameron said this morning - before setting off on another holiday. The Prime Minister insisted he was not ‘sending in the British Army’ to Iraq, but maintained that it was right to use the UK’s ‘military prowess’ to help the Kurds fight Islamic State jihadists. Mr Cameron’s remarks came after the Defence Secretary Michael Fallon revealed Britain’s involvement in Iraq could last for ‘months’. Despite the stark warnings Mr Cameron revealed this morning that he was set to go on holiday again this week - despite the US President cutting short his break for emergency meetings at the White House. The PM will spend time in Cornwall with his family - less than a week after returning from Portugal 12 hours earlier than planned to chair an emergency meeting on the Iraq crisis. Scroll down for video . David Cameron and his wife Samantha at a market in Aljezur, on the southwestern coast of Portugal earlier this month . Mr Cameron and Samantha visited Cornwall last year as well. Here they are pictured on a bench outside a cafe overlooking the beach at Polzeath . Mr Cameron defended his holiday plans . this morning. Asked whether it was right that he was going away amid . efforts to tackle the threat from Islamic State extremists, he said he would remain 'within a few feet of a BlackBerry'. 'I always make sure there are senior ministers on duty in Westminster,' he said after delivering a speech in central London. 'But . I don't hand over the Government to a deputy. Wherever I am, wherever I . am in the world I am always within a few feet of a BlackBerry and an . ability to manage things should they need to be managed. 'And . indeed as I have done on I think almost every holiday that I have . enjoyed over the last few years, to return instantly should that be . necessary. 'For the next few days I shall not be terribly far away, so if that's necessary you will find me at my desk.' David Cameron said he was always available on his blackberry - even from holiday . Mr Cameron has insisted British troops will not be sent to Iraq - but claimed it was imperative to help the country's fledgling Government battle Islamic State forces . Mr Cameron's remarks came after the Defence Secretary told troops in Cyprus that Britain needed to help Iraq combat terrorism. His remarks came amid a series of dramatic developments on the ground that will fuel concerns about mission creep and prompt fresh demands for the recall of Parliament. Mission: A RAF Tornado lands at RAF Akrotiri. British military planes are flying deeper into Iraq to capture surveillance footage of jihadist fighters . Purpose: Britain has limited its role to aid drops, surveillance and transporting supplies to Kurdish forces . Kurdish Peshmerga forces retook Iraq's largest dam near Mosul in northern Iraq after US bombing raids . David Cameron this morning insisted Britain was 'not going to get involved . in another war in Iraq' adding: ‘We are not going to be putting boots on the ground.' But the Defence Secretary Michael Fallon yesterday revealed troops had been on the ground in Iraq for the first time since British forces withdrew from the country in 2009. Regular soldiers from the Yorkshire Regiment were in the Kurdish region last week to prepare an evacuation of trapped Yazidi refugees from Mount Sinjar. The SAS has also reportedly been in the country for six weeks. A new deployment of 150 special forces troops is likely to begin this week. British military planes meanwhile are flying deeper . into Iraq to capture surveillance footage of jihadist fighters to help Kurdish and Iraqi forces on the ground. The new deployment of 150 special forces troops is likely to begin later this week. It will include signals specialists and electronics experts with equipment capable of intercepting voice transmissions at a distance of more than 150 miles. There will also be men from a new SBS unit which will be used to monitor sensitive areas of the Jordanian border. But speaking on BBC Breakfast this morning, Mr Cameron insisted Britain was not being dragged into another war in the Middle East. He said: ‘What we are trying to do is to help with the situation that we face. ‘First of all, that is the humanitarian situation that we face... but alongside the humanitarian crisis there is also a political and extremism crisis in Iraq that has a direct effect on us back here in the UK.' He added: ‘So we are helping the Kurds, we are working with the Iraqi government to make sure it is more representative of the whole country and, of course, we are working with neighbours and allies to put the maximum amount of pressure on IS and make sure it is properly dealt with. ‘We have said that if the Kurds, the Peshmerga, want to have arms from us, that is something we would consider favourably. ‘Up to now they have not been making that request. Really the sort of weapons they have been using have been more eastern bloc variety, and so they have been supplied by others.’ Mr Cameron said he viewed the Kurds as the ‘first line of defence against these murderous extremists in IS that are causing so much damage in Iraq’. But he insisted that IS had already started inflicting ‘damage here in Europe’, highlighting a shooting at a Jewish museum in Brussels. ‘We have already had the first IS motivated attacks in Europe; for instance, the dreadful terrorism that took place in Brussels just a few weeks ago.’ However, he stressed: ‘I want to be absolutely clear to you and to families watching at home, Britain is not going to get involved in another war in Iraq. ‘We are not going to be putting boots on the ground. We are not going to be sending in the British Army. ‘Yes, we should use all the assets that we have, our diplomacy, our political relationships, our aid, the military prowess, the expertise that we have to help others - we should use these things as part of a strategy to put pressure on Islamic State and make sure this terrorist organisation is properly addressed and it cannot cause mayhem on our own streets.’ The PM said ‘keeping people safe here at home’ was his ‘number one, two and three priorities’. Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga fighters drive trucks as they head to the Mosul dam on the Tigris river that they recaptured from Islamic State jihadists yesterday . Advance: A Kurdish peshmerga fighter close to the strategically important Mosul Dam, which Kurdish and US forces are poised to take back . Yesterday, Mr Cameron said Britain . should use its military prowess to stop Islamists creating ‘a terrorist . state on the shores of the Mediterranean’. He said the UK was ‘in  the . middle of a generational  struggle against a poisonous and  extremist . ideology’. The Prime . Minister added: ‘If we do not act to stem the onslaught of this . exceptionally dangerous terrorist movement, it will only grow stronger . until it can target us on the streets of Britain.’ Until . now, Britain has limited its role to aid drops, surveillance and . transporting supplies to Kurdish forces. But Mr Cameron, writing in a . Sunday newspaper, said: ‘True security will only be achieved if we use . all our resources – aid, diplomacy, our military prowess – to help bring . about a more stable world.’ He added: ‘We need a firm security . response, whether that is military action to go after the terrorists, . international co-operation on intelligence and counter-terrorism or . uncompromising action against terrorists at home.’ While . saying he did not back full-scale military involvement and ‘sending . armies to fight or occupy’, Mr Cameron left open the possibility of . Britain taking on a more direct role in supporting Iraqi and Kurdish . troops on the ground. Speaking . on a visit to the RAF Akrotiri base in Cyprus, Mr Fallon said: ‘This is . not simply a humanitarian mission. We and other countries in Europe are . determined to do what we can to help the government of Iraq combat this . new and very extreme form of terrorism.’ Mr . Fallon revealed that troops from 2nd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment . flew in as part of preparations for a helicopter mission to save . stranded members of the Yazidi group on a mountainside. They were on the . ground for 24 hours before flying back to Cyprus after the operation . was called off. Addressing airmen and soldiers at the . base, Mr Fallon said: ‘This mission isn’t over. The humanitarian needs . are there…There may well now be in the next few weeks and months other . ways that we may need to help save life, protect people. We are going to . need all of you again and the surveillance you are able to give us.’ Hundreds of refuges, including women and children, sought shelter in a primary school in Dohuk in Iraqi Kurdistan after escaping from Mount Sinjar . Plight: Displaced Iraqis from the Yazidi community settle at the Qandil mountains near the Turkish border outside Zakho, 300 miles northwest of Baghdad . Support: Displaced Yazidis find shelter under a bridge. David Cameron has left open the possibility of Britain taking on a more direct role in supporting Iraqi and Kurdish troops on the ground . In recent weeks IS fighters have . seized vast swathes of land in Syria and Iraq, advancing towards Baghdad . and prompting US air strikes. Yesterday, .

"Kurdish and Iraqi fighters have . reclaimed control of the country's largest dam from ISIS militants who . captured it less than two weeks ago, an army spokesman in Baghdad said. The . Mosul Dam, spanning the Tigris River just north of Iraq's . second-largest city, would mark the first major victory for forces battling ISIS jihadists since U.S. airstrikes began earlier this . month. ISIS militants have denied the claims, however, insisting they are still in control of the dam - which holds great strategic value as it . supplies electricity and water to a large part of the country. The development comes amid news that a takeaway owner from Liverpool and another man from Leeds have travelled to Iraq to fight alongside the Kurdish troops battling against ISIS. Scroll down for video . A Kurdish peshmerga fighter prepares his weapon at his combat position near the Mosul Dam today, which security officials say has now been recaptured . Smoke can be seen billowing from the direction of the dam, Iraq's largest, after a U.S. air strike close to the facility today . The dam is around 30 miles from the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, where this picture - showing smoke billowing from a site close to the dam - was taken, moments after an air strike . Purpose: News of the dam being retaken comes as a takeaway manager from Liverpool, Mohammed Abudullah, revealed he had travelled to Iraq to fight alongside Kurdish troops, saying: 'I don't care if I die' Mohammed Abudullah - who runs a takeaway food store in Liverpool - gave an interview to Sky News saying he felt just as at home holding an assault rifle in a war zone as he did running his shop . The retaking of the Mosul Dam would be . a significant morale boost for Kurdish and Iraqi troops as they try to . free territory overrun by ISIS in a lighting advance his summer. Army . spokesman Lt. Gen. Qassim al-Moussawi said the dam itself was secured . by Kurdish peshmerga troops and Iraqi security forces on Monday but that . the southern side of the complex remains contested and that fierce . fighting is underway to free that area. At least 170 bombs have been dismantled around the dam but many more remain, al-Moussawi added in a televised statement. Al-Moussawi said the Iraqi and Kurdish forces 'hoisted the Iraqi flag over' the dam. He . added that the troops were backed by a joint aerial support but didn't . specify whether there were any U.S. airstrikes in the area today. Kurdish troops stand guard in Chamibarakat, close to the dam, which was taken by Jihadi forces two weeks ago . A peshmerga fighter patrols near the strategically important dam, the recapture of which is the biggest prize since the Islamist State extremist group started its offensive in Iraq . News of the dam being retaken comes as . a man from Leeds and a takeaway manager from Merseyside revealed they had travelled to Iraq to . fight alongside Kurdish troops battling against ISIS. Mohammed Abudullah - who runs a takeaway food store in Liverpool - gave an interview to Sky News saying he felt just as at home holding an assault rifle in a war zone as he did running his shop. 'Actually, I’ve got a British passport, I’ve got everything, I’ve got a . life there, I don’t need anything but I’m here just for Kurdistan, for . Kurdish people, for my family. I don’t care if I get killed or not,' he was quoted as saying. Mr Abdullah appears alongside other Kurdish fighters in a video showing the group battling against ISIS militants Jalula. Appearing overwhelmed by the fighting in comparison . to the highly trained peshmerga, he said: 'My friends have been killed . next to me. If people were killed next to you, you are going to be . happy? No.... That’s why I feel I need to fight here. I’ll fight here . until I’m going to die.' In the footage, Iraqi-born Leeds resident Saman Baqu claims also he also travelled to the country from Britain, where he says he has lived for the last 12 years. The dam, located on the Tigris river, supplies electricity and water for irrigation to northern Iraq . The dam is around 30 miles from the city of Mosul, and 280 miles from the Iraqi capital Baghdad . The claim that Kurdish and Iraqi . forces had 'liberated a large part of the Mosul Dam' came from Iraq's . Ministry of Defence this morning. U.S. Central Command would not immediately confirm any involvement in the . operation, although air strikes have been carried out in the area around . the dam in recent days. However . one  senior Kurdish commander that his peshmerga forces had already . withdrawn from the dam this afternoon because it was heavily rigged with . explosives. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to media. In . an internet statement, ISIS denied losing control of the dam, . dismissing the government's claim as a 'mere propaganda war.' The . statement, which could not be independently verified, was posted on a . website frequently used by the militants. Peshmerga fighters head towards the dam in a convoy of trucks. The recapture is a major victory in the fight against Islamic State extremists . The Kurdish forces launched the operation to retake the Mosul Dam early this morning, according to Kurdish commander General Tawfik Desty, after a day of U.S. and Iraqi airstrikes pushed back Islamic State fighters . The U.S. launched airstrikes against . the Islamic State group in Iraq more than a week ago in a bid to halt . its advance across the north. The U.S. military said U.S. forces conducted nine strikes Saturday and another 16 on Sunday. The . dam's seizure by Islamic State militants on Aug. 7 was part of a string . of victories by the Sunni radical group as it looks to expand its hold . in northern Iraq, driving back Kurdish forces, sending minority . communities fleeing and unleashing a wave of violence over a territory . straddling the Syria-Iraq border. The . decision to launch airstrikes marked the first direct U.S. military . intervention in Iraq since the last American troops withdrew in 2011 and . reflected growing international concern about the extremist group. A senior military commander said the advance of Kurdish forces was hindered by roadside bombs and buildings rigged with explosives, planted by retreating Islamic State fighters . The White House sent a letter to . Congress on Sunday saying that its air campaign in Iraq 'is consistent . with the president's directive that the U.S. military protect U.S. personnel and facilities in Iraq, since the failure of the Mosul Dam . could threaten the lives of large numbers of civilians and threaten U.S. personnel and facilities - including the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.' It . also noted that the failure of the dam could 'prevent the Iraqi . government from providing critical services' to the Iraqi people. Some 1.5 million people have been displaced by fighting in Iraq since the Islamic State's rapid advance began in June.

"Life sentence: Jeffrey MacDonald, 70, has vowed to continue to fight against his conviction for the horrific stabbing deaths of his pregnant wife and two daughters . The case of the Green Beret doctor who has maintained for decades that not him but a band of hippies chanting 'acid is groovy, kill the pigs' slaughtered his wife and two young daughters will continue in court. Jeffrey MacDonald, 70, is serving a life sentence for the murders of his pregnant wife and two daughters, who were killed February 17, 1970, in the family apartment at Fort Bragg. Despite the latest judicial rejection of . his claims of innocence and a request for a new trial, his attorney . Gordon Widenhouse said Friday, 'There's going to be further litigation.' MacDonald - who was convicted in 1979, . released in 1980 and returned to prison in 1982 - has maintained his . innocence for the last 44 years. In . a decision based on a hearing held almost two years ago, Judge James C. Fox rejected both MacDonald's claim of innocence and his appeal. ' ... the court finds that MacDonald has not established, by clear and . convincing evidence, that no reasonable factfinder would have found him . guilty of the murder of his wife and two daughters ...' Fox wrote, . adding that MacDonald 'failed to establish any assumed actual innocence . claim.' At that . hearing, MacDonald's attorneys emphasized that Helena Stoeckley, who . testified at MacDonald's trial, wasn't involved in the murders and that . she didn't know where she was when Colette MacDonald, five-year-old . Kimberley and two-year-old Kristen were killed. Her . attorney, Jerry Leonard, testified at the 2012 hearing that Stoeckley, . who died in 1983, told him two versions of events: that she wasn't in . the apartment and that she was, but that she didn't participate in the . murders. Life sentence: A handcuffed Dr. Jeffrey Macdonald is led away from Federal Court in Raleigh on Wednesday, August 28, 1979 after a jury found him guilty of one count of first degree murder and the two count of of second degree murder . Former family man: This 1969 photo shows Jeffrey MacDonald and his wife Colette in Fort Bragg, North Carolina. A year later, a pregnant Colette and her two daughters were brutally slain . 'We're obviously disappointed that Judge Fox denied our requests for relief because we thought we had presented credible evidence that the (trial) jury had not heard, particularly from Helena Stoeckley, which we thought would have made a difference, given the circumstantial evidence the prosecutor presented at that trial,' Widenhouse said. U.S. Attorney Thomas Walker said in a news release that MacDonald will have to seek permission from the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to appeal Fox's ruling. MacDonald's attorneys also argued that new evidence, including DNA from the apartment that didn't match MacDonald or his family, supported MacDonald's claims. They also called witnesses to testify about statements by a retired U.S. marshal, who is now dead, that a prosecutor pressured Stoeckley to lie on the stand. The man most likely: Jeffrey MacDonald (left) resumed dating high school sweetheart Colette and they were married in 1963 before the birth of their first child Kimberley . Moving on: The incarcerated former Army doctor (pictured in 1995) remarried in 2002 but remains behind bars . The statements by the marshal likely 'are fabrications or confused memories,' Fox wrote, which made all of them 'incredible and unreliable.' The DNA evidence 'is far from clear and convincing of MacDonald's actual innocence,' the judge wrote. Bob Stevenson, Colette MacDonald's brother, said Friday that he takes 'absolute and total satisfaction' in Fox's decision.  He said he wasn't surprised that MacDonald plans to keep pursuing the case. 'I know it will never be over until he is dead or I am dead,' Stevenson said. The MacDonald family murders brought chills to the community, coming just months after the murders by the Charles Manson followers in California, where 'pig' was written in blood on the door of the home where actress Sharon Tate and four others were killed. And like the Manson murders, the MacDonald killings led to books, the most famous of which was 'Fatal Vision.' Written by author Joe McGinness, the book - and the television miniseries based on it - concluded MacDonald was guilty.  Just before the 2012 hearing for MacDonald, documentary filmmaker Errol Morris' book, 'A Wilderness of Error,' was published. Morris concluded that MacDonald did not get a fair trial and might not be guilty.","Jeffrey MacDonald, 70, is serving a life sentence for the murders of his pregnant wife and their two daughters in 1970 .

"Honolulu police officers have urged lawmakers to keep an exemption in state law that allows undercover officers to have sex with prostitutes during investigations, touching off a heated debate. Authorities say they need the legal protection to catch lawbreakers in the act. Critics, including human trafficking experts and other police, say it's unnecessary and could further victimize sex workers, many of whom have been forced into the trade. Police haven't said how often - or even if - they use the provision. And when they asked legislators to preserve it, they made assurances that internal policies and procedures are in place to prevent officers from taking advantage of it. Hawaii police have urged lawmakers to allow them to legally use prostitutes claiming that it is important for undercover police work (stock image) But expert Derek Marsh says the exemption is 'antiquated at best' and that police can easily do without it. 'It doesn't help your case, and at worst you further traumatize someone. And do you think he or she is going to trust a cop again?' asked Marsh, who trains California police in best practices on human trafficking cases and twice has testified to Congress about the issue. A Hawaii bill cracking down on prostitution (HB 1926) was originally written to scrap the sex exemption for officers on duty. It was amended to restore that protection after police testimony. The revised proposal passed the state House and will go before a Senate committee on Friday. It's not immediately clear whether similar provisions are in place elsewhere as state law or department policy. But advocates were shocked that Hawaii exempts police from its prostitution laws, suggesting it's an invitation for misconduct. 'Police abuse is part of the life of prostitution,' said Melissa Farley, the executive director of the San Francisco-based group Prostitution Research and Education. Farley said that in places without such police protections 'women who have escaped prostitution' commonly report being coerced into giving police sexual favors to keep from being arrested. The Hawaii bill aims to ratchet up penalties on johns and pimps. Selling sex would remain a petty misdemeanor. During recent testimony, Honolulu police said the sex exemption protects investigations and should remain in place. As Hawaii lawmakers considered a measure that would crack down on prostitution, the Honolulu Police Department requested for it to remain legal for undercover officers to have sex with prostitutes . 'The procedures and conduct of the undercover officers are regulated by department rules, which by nature have to be confidential,' Honolulu Police Maj. Jerry Inouye told the House Judiciary Committee. 'Because if prostitution suspects, pimps and other people are privy to that information, they're going to know exactly how far the undercover officer can and cannot go.' Democratic state Rep. Karl Rhoads, the committee chairman, said police testimony convinced him to amend the proposal. 'It's a really murky area,' said Rhoads, who represents a district that includes Honolulu's Chinatown, a longstanding epicenter of street prostitution. 'I was reluctant to interfere in something that they face all the time. If they think it's necessary to not have it in the statute, this is one area where I did defer to them and say, ''I hope you're not having sex with prostitutes.''' Critics say the police perspective is off base. Lauren Hersh, a former prosecuting attorney who runs the global trafficking program of the women's advocacy group Equality Now, said the risk of re-victimizing a sex worker, who may already have been trafficked, should make sex during an investigation off-limits. 'I can understand you're in a drug den, and you have a gun to your head and someone says ''snort this,''' Hersh said, acknowledging the gray areas associated with undercover police work. But the sex exemption in Hawaii is 'so dissimilar from that circumstance on so many levels'. There have been instances of police being accused of victimizing sex workers across the nation. In Philadelphia, a former officer is on trial facing charges of raping two prostitutes after forcing them at gunpoint to take narcotics. A former West Sacramento, California, officer is awaiting sentencing after being found guilty of raping prostitutes in his police cruiser while on patrol. And last year in Massachusetts, a former police officer pleaded guilty to extorting sex from prostitutes he threatened with arrest. Hawaii state Rep. Karl Rhoads listens during a House floor session at the Capitol in Honolulu on March 19 . Rhoads said he knew no reason to suspect Honolulu police are out of line. 'All . allegations of misconduct are investigated and the appropriate . disciplinary action taken,' said Michelle Yu, Honolulu police . spokeswoman, in an email. It's . not clear, however, what the punishment would be. The disclosure laws . for police misconduct in Hawaii make it impossible to know if an on-duty . officer had faced discipline or accusations of having sex with a . prostitute. Officers who . investigate prostitution haven't been accused of sexual wrongdoing in . recent memory, Yu said. A parole officer in 2011 was fired after being . convicted of sexual assault against a prostitute, she said. Skeptics, . such as Roger Young, a retired special agent who for more than 20 years . worked sex crimes for the FBI from Las Vegas and has trained vice . squads around the country, remain unconvinced. Young . said on Thursday: 'I don't know of any state or federal law that allows . any law enforcement officer undercover to penetrate or do what this law . is allowing.'","A Hawaii bill cracking down on .

"Folding bikes may not be new, but this latest model takes the idea a step further by not only adding an electric motor, but making it so small it can fit inside in a bag. The Impossible bike travels at 12.5mph (20km/h) for 45 minutes on a single charge, and can carry the weight of a 13-stone (85kg) rider. The designers have launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund production of the bike, and although they don’t reveal the exact dimensions or weight of the bike, a video shows it being placed easily in an average backpack. Scroll down for video . The Impossible bike (pictured) from Beijing-based Impossible Technology supports riders of up to 13 stone (85kg). It travels at 12.5mph (20km/h) for 45 minutes using 10 2,900mAh batteries. The brakes are controlled using a button on the handlebars, and the wheels are hollow, but solid . Unfolding the carbon fibre bike is carried out in four stages. It is unlocked, the saddle and handlebars twist into position, the whole bike is pulled up to the correct height, and then frame locks it all into place. This height is adjustable and comes with four options - 2.1ft (65cm), 2.2ft (70cm), 2.4ft (75cm) and 2.6ft (80cm). The brakes are controlled using a button on the handlebars, and the wheels are hollow, but solid. Impossible is powered by a DC brushless motor, custom-built by the Beijing-based design team, and it runs on 10 2,900mAh batteries. Unfolding the carbon fibre bike is carried out in four stages. It is unlocked, the saddle and handlebars twist into position, the whole bike is pulled up to the correct height and then frame locks it all into place. This height is adjustable and comes with four options: 2.1ft (65cm), 2.2ft (70cm), 2.4ft (75cm) and 2.6ft (80cm) The designers have launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund production of the bike, and although they don’t reveal the exact dimensions or weight of the bike, a video shows it being placed easily in an average backpack (screengrab pictured) An engineer who was told by cyclists that they never wore a helmet because they were 'an inconvenience to carry' recently came up with a solution - the folding helmet. The Plixi helmet, neatly folds away to a third of its size in small bags. It costs about £79 ($126) and was made by engineer Phillipe Arrouart, 40, from Paris. The size of the helmet when folded is 8.3 x 4.3 x 6.3 inches (21 x 11 x 16 cm), and it weights just 1lb (490g). Its outer shell is made of ABS plastic and the inner shell is made of expanded polystyrene. The prototype version travels at 12.5mph (20km/h) for 45 minutes on a single charge, and these batteries take around half an hour to recharge. ‘One of our main challenges was choosing an electric motor that would fit our parameters both in terms of power and in terms of weight,’ said Impossible Technology. ‘For the purposes of our proof of concept, we have modified an existing electric motor. ‘However, Impossible will be shipped with a motor completely designed by Impossible Technology.’ The bike doesn’t have pedals, which means if the battery runs out mid-ride there is no way to power the device. The frame is built around circles, instead of a single horizontal girder. This ‘helps to ensure that the bike spreads the weight equally across the frame’ and the designed said they put the seat and the handle bars at similar heights so that the front and rear wheels would bear the weight of the rider equally.

This ‘helps to ensure that the bike spreads the weight equally across the frame’ A white model (pictured) can be ordered for £241 ($430 CAD), a black model costs £258 ($480 CAD) But, as the designers explained on their Kickstarter page: ‘The main point of our bike is that it is light and small enough to be folded into your backpack. ‘If we add pedals or any other chain structure it will take more space and make it heavier.‘ . But, they said they are making extra batteries to act as a backup. Plus, because of the bike's short charging time, the rider should be able to ‘fold it into a backpack and walk to a coffee shop to recharge the battery.’ Designers have already raised more than £123,000 ($218,850 CAD) via the Kickstarter campaign - achieving almost four times its target amount. A white model can be pre-ordered for £241 ($430 CAD), while a black model costs £258 ($480 CAD). Once the campaign ends on 25 December, Impossible bikes will be shipped internationally by August 2015.","The Impossible bike supports riders of up to 13 stone (85kg)

"Documents released Thursday reveal that authorities in Massachusetts suspect that former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez was the shooter in the double-murder of two men outside of a nightclub in Boston in 2012. No charges have been filed in the deaths of Daniel Jorge Correia de Abreu and Safiro Teixeira Furtado, who were killed on July 16, 2012, when somebody inside an SUV opened fire on their car. A third person was shot but survived. A June 28 police affidavit and searched warrant application released by Superior Court in Bristol, Conn., says there is probable cause to believe that Hernandez was driving the vehicle used in the shooting and 'may have been the shooter.' Connection? Aaron Hernandez, who is accused of killing a semi-pro footballer in June, was allegedly in the same club as two men hours before they were murdered in a drive-by shooting in Boston in 2012 . The warrant request follows a bombshell report released last week that . sheds new light on why authorities in Massachusetts have named accused killer Hernandez as a . suspect in the double-murder. The new . developments - detailed in a search warrant released in Superior Court . in Bristol - indicate that authorities believe that the June 17 murder . of Odin Lloyd is in someway related to the double-murder of Abreu and Furtado, who were fatally shot outside of the Cure Lounge in Boston. According . to the warrant, police say Hernandez and friend Alexander Bradley - who . later sued Hernandez, claiming that he shot him in the face last . February - were at the Cure Lounge on the night of the double-murder. Also at the club that night were Abreau and Furtado. It . previously has been reported that Hernandez and his friends fought with . Abreau, Furtado and their friends prior to the shooting. However, there . is no mention of an altercation between the two groups in the recently . released warrant, which was first obtained by the Hartford Courant. According . to the warrant, authorities believe Hernandez and Bradley were in a . silver SUV that circled the block outside of the Cure Lounge, apparently . waiting for Abreau and Furtado to leave. When . the men left with their friends about 2:30 a.m., the silver Toyota SUV . pulled up next to the gray BMW were in and someone opened fire. The warrant does not specify whether authorities think Hernandez was the trigger man - but the warrant request released Thursday identifies Hernandez as the shooter. The . warrant explains that authorities reopened the case into the . double-murder after a detective investigating Lloyd's death - who also . investigated the murders of Abreau and Furtado - remembered seeing . Hernandez at the Cure Lounge while reviewing surveillance footage from . the club taken the night of the murders. Victims: Safiro Furtado, left, and Daniel Abreu, right, were killed after getting in an altercation in a club last year . Scene: The men were killed as they drove from the club with other friends on July 15, 2012 . Seized: Police took an SUV similar to one seen at the scene from Hernandez's uncle's house . Additionally, . authorities received an anonymous tip from an employee at the Rumor . nightclub - where Hernandez and Lloyd had been seen arguing two days . prior to Lloyd's murder - who claimed to have information indicating . that the Lloyd murder and the double-murder at the Cure Lounge were . related. According to . the warrant, Rumor security guard Sharif Hashem called the North . Attleborough police department on June 22 - just days after Lloyd's . murder - and said someone had 'accidentally spilled the beans' about the . connection between the three murders in front of him. The . combination of the tip and the detective's recollection of seeing . Hernandez at the club where Abreau and Furtado were murdered caused . authorities to reopen the investigation into the double-murder. Since . the case has been reopened, investigators have seized the murder weapon . in the double-homicide and Hernandez's silver Toyota SUV, which was . towed from a home in Bristol, Connecticut owned by Hernandez's uncle. The . investigation also uncovered other surveillance footage from the Cure . Lounge taken from the night of the double-murder that shows Hernandez . and Bradley entering the club immediately after the victims. According . to the warrant, Hernandez had two drinks and then left 10 minutes . later. Further, it shows Hernandez and Bradley leaving a parking garage . near the club in the silver Toyota SUV about 1:30 a.m. - about an hour . prior to the shooting - with Hernandez in the driver's seat and Bradley . sitting in the front passenger seat. It's . unclear what Hernandez and Bradley did next, but when Abreau and . Furtado left the club about an hour later, the silver Toyota SUV was . seen back in the area and captured by surveillance cameras at the . parking garage. The SUV was then seen circling the block near the victims at a slow speed in the lane closest to the sidewalk. Arrest: The gun allegedly used to shoot the two men was found in the trunk of a car driven by Jailene Diaz-Ramos, pictured. She said she was giving a ride to footballer friends who must have left it there . At . 2:32 a.m., Boston police received a call about shots fired outside of . the Cure Lounge. Abreau and Furtado were killed. Another man was injured . in the shooting. Witnesses . told police that the vehicle from which the shooter fired was a silver . Toyota SUV with one man driving and another in the backseat. Other . witnesses gave descriptions of the assailants that were similar to those . of both Hernandez and and Bradley. Evidence recovered at the scene led authorities to believe that the weapon used was either a .38- or .357-caliber pistol. In . June, police found a .38-caliber pistol in the trunk of a car driven by . Jai Lene Diaz-Ramos, who crashed the car in Springfield. Diaz-Ramos . reportedly told authorities some football players had been in her car . and may have left the gun in her trunk. She currently faces three . illegal firearm charges. Hernandez, . who signed a five-year, $40 million deal with the Patriots just a month . before the alleged double-murder, has been held without bail in the . county jail since he was charged with Lloyd's murder on June 26. The . investigation also uncovered other surveillance footage from the Cure .

Two others were treated for injuries in nearby hospitals, including one person with only minor wounds. Details about the shooting were still vague midday because the victims were not cooperating with police, according to Sgt. D.B. Gates. 'Our understanding is that it happened in the parking lot,' Gates said. 'The club was either closing or had closed. A lot of people were milling around the parking lot, and that's when the shots were heard.'

"Amazon launched its first mobile phone in a blaze of publicity in its bid to take on Apple and Google. However, one tracking firm claims the launch has been a damp squib, claiming the phone has been outsold by all its rivals. Amazon has refused to reveal just how many handsets it has sold. Scroll down for Video . Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos holds up the new Amazon Fire Phone. The handset has a 4.7-inch display with 720p HD resolution, a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon processor, 2GB of RAM, and six individual camera modules to make the 3D effect work. The device has a front facing camera in each corner of the screen. These extra cameras are used to track the position of the user’s face and eyes in relation to the phone’s display. The handset chooses the two best views, and can even work at night using infrared. This allows Amazon’s software to make constant adjustments to the positioning of on-screen elements, altering the perspective of visuals on the screen and making them appear to be in 3D - without the need for glasses. 'While the Fire Phone was listed atop Amazon’s Best Seller list for several days in early August, North American usage of the device has grown only incrementally, rather than exponentially, in the three weeks following the smartphone’s launch as an AT&T exclusive,' ad firm Chitika Insights said. It analyzed tens of millions of U.S. and Canadian smartphone-based online ad impressions generated within the Chitika Ad Network from July 25 through August 14, 2014. The Fire phone's usage share is .02%, which puts its launch on par with that of the Motorola Droid Ultra, but below the launch of the LG G3 . Chitika said the Fire had performed badly compared to LG's recently released G3. 'Usage rates of the LG G3 rose relatively sharply following its release earlier in the summer, particularly once Verizon and Sprint began offering the device on July 17 and 18, respectively. 'This contrasts starkly to Amazon’s Fire Phone, with that device’s usage growth remaining steady but relatively flat over the same post-launch time period.' However, the firm says the slow start to sales could be due to amazon's decsision to only sell the handset through AT&T. amazon's Fire was outsold by LG's G3 . 'The somewhat mild adoption of the Fire Phone may be seen as an expected consequence given the smartphone’s carrier exclusivity,' it said. 'While Amazon certainly is looking to make the Fire Phone a hit, current conditions show this being more realistic as a long-term goal rather than a short term one,' the firm said. Jeff Bezos himself said the company plans to 'be patient,' and other industry watchers see the Fire Phone as being a long-term play for Amazon. 'Discounting or expanding the availability of the device would likely help boost adoption, but it may be more likely that Amazon refocuses its efforts for a second generation of the Fire Phone and the accompanying software in order to make a larger mark on the industry.. The Fire handset was unveiled by Jeff Bezos at a special event in Seattle. 'It's time to whip the crown from Apple,' said Mr Bezos before showing off the new handset for the first time. The Fire also performed poorly compared to the Mitorola Droid ultra . The Fire will use head-tracking technology to make images on the smartphone's display appear to be 3D with a feature called 'dynamic perspective'. 'There is always more to see by changing your perspective,' Bezos said. 'What if there were a thousand artists standing by to redraw the picture every time you moved your head?' Apps using the new feature includes a Maps app that lets users see around buildings. Users can also tilt the phone to 'look around' an on screen map. The handset has a 4.7-inch display with 720p HD resolution, a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon processor, 2GB of RAM, and six individual camera modules to make the 3D effect work. It will run a highly customized version of Google’s Android operating system similar to the one seen on Amazon’s Kindle Fire tablets, and come with special tangle-free headphones. Apps available at launch include Netflix, HBO Go, Hulu Plus and ESPN. It also boasts a Gorilla Glass 3 screen with a rubber frame, and aluminum buttons. Users will also have unlimited photo storage via the Amazon Cloud, and syncing with the company's recently launched Fire TV set-top box so you can send media to your TV. The phone has its own menu system, and users can even navigate by tilting the handset. They can also see different app catergies through a special 'tray' that appears when they swip (right) 'Fire Phone puts everything you love about Amazon in the palm of your hand—instant access to Amazon’s vast content ecosystem and exclusive features like the Mayday button, ASAP, Second Screen, X-Ray, free unlimited photo storage, and more,' said Bezos. 'The Firefly button lets you identify printed web and email addresses, phone numbers, QR and bar codes, artwork, and over 100 million items, including songs, movies, TV shows, and products—and take action in seconds.' how they compare: The new fire is up against Apple's iPhone 5s and Samsung's Galaxy S5 . The MayDay 24-hour video help feature will also be available on Fire Phone, Amazon confirmed. Bezos said the most important thing the firm has done was to 'earn trust with customers'. The handset will initially be offered in the US only by AT&T in a deal that echoes the launch of the original iPhone. The deal has already riled AT&T's competitors, . Seattle based T-Mobile’s chief executive, John Legere, tweeted, 'Really, @Amazon? What happened to home-town pride?' Amazon also announced that the Fire Phone will come with a new app called Firefly. This uses the camera and visual recognition to identify objects ranging from books to CDs as well as listen to music before looking for it on Amazon. The feature will also recognise phone numbers and web addresses, as well as TV shows. Amazon claims it can recognise 100 million items in less than one second. Once an item is recognised, it can automatically take users to the corresponding Amazon page so they can buy it. The app is triggered by holding the same button that serves as a shortcut to the Fire Phone's camera. Peter Woodd, CEO at phone accessory maker IDT Systems said 'The effect this will have on the Smartphone industry are substantial. 'Consumers are constantly looking for the newest and most innovative device and if Amazon’s Smartphone offers the suggested 3D viewing capabilities, the usual players may find their hold decreasing.' It is the first time the retailer has created a phone, and follows on from the success of the Kindle eReader and Kindle Fire tablet, with sales of eBooks overtaking those of physical copies in the UK in 2012. Although Amazon did not confirm a release date for the UK, experts predict it will be on sale this year outside the US. Ernest Doku, mobiles expert at uSwitch.com said: 'Amazon already has two very effective power-ups in its armoury: brand power and reams of content that smartphone users can soup up their mobiles with. Add those to a quality handset and the mobile market may well have a Trojan Horse on its hands.' Duncan Bell, operations editor at UK-based gadget magazine T3 said: 'The Amazon phone's solid hardware and verging-on-pointless software features are irrelevant here. Amazon sees this as a platform to flog its content, just as it did with ebooks on Kindles. Problem is, all its video and audio content is or will be available on every other device known to humanity, leaving no compelling reason to buy its own phone.' Ramzi Yakob, industry expert and strategist at digital agency TH-NK said: 'Alarm bells started ringing when I realised that Jeff Bezos had spent more than twice the amount of time explaining how Dynamic Perspective was developed than actually showing us what it can do to improve the user experience. It clearly isn't a game changer.' Ernest Doku, mobiles expert at uSwitch.com, said: 'Arriving so late to the over-crowded smartphone party requires tactical consideration, and Amazon has covered all bases with a handset which is both big on spectacle and packed with features. 'Amazon already has two very effective power-ups in its armoury: brand power and reams of content that smartphone users can soup up their mobiles with. 'Add those to a quality handset and the mobile market may well have an Trojan Horse on its hands. 'Amazon’s killer blow lies in its deep connection to the Prime subscription service.

"Passengers travelling between Australia's major cities on the proposed High Speed Rail network (HSR) could pay as little as $50 a ticket. The Labor Party has confirmed that re-establishing the HSR will be one of its key policies for the next federal election, which means the first train from Sydney to Canberra could roll out by 2035. Shadow Transport Minister Anthony Albanese has told Daily Mail Australia that he is committed to spending '$52 million to establish the planning authority' for the HSR. 'We think it’s a real project and that we have to act now to start planning for it.' It's time to get going. Shadow Transport Minister Anthony Albanese has flagged Labor's intention to put the High Speed Rail network back on the agenda heading into the next federal election . The preferred route of the High Speed Rail network along Australia's east coast, taking in four capital cities and several regional locations . Two separate reports, one from the Australasian Railway Association (ARA) and another by Beyond Zero Emissions (BZE), have provided hope it could be completed at a significant cost reduction. In fact, the latest study shows that construction costs have nearly halved. ARA CEO, Bryan Nye, said the new information highlights the need to stop debating, commit to the project and put high speed rail to the market. '$63 billion is 45 per cent less than the $114 billion price tag put on high speed rail two years ago,' Mr Nye said. 'Prices haven’t come down, instead this new $63 billion price tag is a reflection of current international construction costs. 'These construction costs are why the project needs to be put out to the global market. 'Let’s put the project out to our overseas colleagues, in Europe, Japan and China. They have the experience, let’s allow them to show us how to fund, construct and operate high speed rail in Australia,' he said. High Speed Rail supporters say travel time by fast trains can be the equal of flying to certain destinations and in some cases they are reduced when airport screening and waiting times are factored in . Inside the cockpit of a high speed train. If authors of recent reports are right, the first trip between Sydney and Canberra could occur in about 15 years and tickets could be as cheap as $50 . Cost of a ticket could be as little as $50 between the major cities and express journey times of just over two and a half hours from Sydney to Melbourne or Brisbane. HSR supporters point out that is a similar time frame when travel to and from airports, screening and waiting times, are factored in. To travel the full length of the corridor, from Melbourne to Brisbane, will take about 5 hours and 56 minutes. Mr Albanese said his first order of business will be to establish a High Speed Rail Authority 'to progress the project and begin the process of securing the corridor'. However, because of the high cost of bringing a HSR network to life, it's likely to require a public-private partnership. Travel times of just over 2 and a half hours between Sydney to Melbourne and Sydney to Brisbane . He said 'high speed rail (is) in the box seat'. Mr Albanese challenged the Abbott Government to recommit funding for a High Speed Rail Authority and secure bi-partisan support for the project. 'Government commitment to the project is needed first, followed by the establishment of a body to oversee the project and then opening Australia’s high speed rail project to the market,' said Mr Nye. Experts believe the ease of train travel, when compared with the often stressful nature of flight, is a principal reason why High Speed Rail will eventually drag more than 40 per cent of passengers away from air travel across the east coast and on the main three routes (Sydney-Melbourne, Sydney-Canberra and Sydney-Brisbane). It would also lead to a 50 per cent increase in travel between the capitals. The Maglev, Japan's super-fast magnetic train. If the High Speed Rail network is built on Australia's east coast, the train is expected to top 250 kilometres per hour between capital cities . The HSR network would comprise approximately 1,748 kilometres, with four city centre stations, four city-peripheral stations (one in Brisbane, two in Sydney and one in Melbourne) and 12 regional stations. To enable fastest possible times between destinations and to keep up with expected demand, it would offer direct express and limited stop services. The BZE report found that by 2065, peak period demand for Sydney to Melbourne would be met by two non-stop inter-capital express services, every hour, in each direction. Peak demands would supplemented by three more one-stop inter-capital express services per hour per direction, calling in at either Sydney South or Melbourne North. Analysts have also assessed the viability of regional stations and come up with 12 sites. They are Gold Coast, Casino, Grafton, Coffs Harbour, Port Macquarie, Taree, Newcastle, Central Coast, Southern Highlands, Wagga Wagga, Albury-Wodonga and Shepparton. They agree that 'fares would be structured to be comparable to and competitive with alternative modes of transport for both business and leisure purposes'. The plush interior of a High Speed Train. This version is the so-called HS2 Mercury, as seen by Priestmangoode, a global travel and transport design consultancy. The UK is also grappling with the benefits and costs of high speed rail. Journey times from Manchester to Leeds could be cut from 48 to 26 minutes . 'HSR fares have been set to be competitive with air fares on the main inter-capital routes on the east coast, trending downwards over time by 0.5 per cent per year to 2015 and remaining constant thereafter, consistent with the forecast reduction in real air fares.' It also points out that 'the proposed HSR network can be powered by 100% renewable energy. This will allow passengersthe choice of travelling with zero emissions for journeys that are appropriate to substitute with HSR'. 'It is estimated that greenhouse gas emissions from regional travel would be reduced by 150 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent over 40 years of operation.' The group was involved in this strategic study on the implementation of a High Speed Rail (HSR) network for the east coast of Australia between Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne - which was announced by then Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, Anthony Albanese, in 2010. Australia is not on its own currently grappling with the benefits and costs of high speed rail, plans for another high-speed rail line in England's north will go ahead even though ministers there admit they have no idea of the impost. The proposed route of the HS3 in northern England will cut travel times by half in some places . High speed trains can travel at speeds of up to 250 kilometres per hour . As the UK Government confirmed it would hold an official ‘review’ into the spiralling costs of the already controversial $90 billion HS2 line, Prime Minister David Cameron and the Chancellor both declared their backing for HS3. They claim the line – which will link Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds and Hull – could boost the nation’s economy by cutting travel times between the cities by half. The ARA says Australia can look to countries like Spain as a prime example of just how an efficient HSR can be competitive. Its network was established in 1992 and with 99 per cent of high speed trains there now running on time, the country brought in a money-back guarantee for passengers if their service was five minutes late. Spanish authorities also recently introduced a significant price cut on tickets and increased patronage by almost 3 million passengers.","The High Speed Rail (HSR) network connecting major east coast cities will be a key plank of ALP policies heading into 2016 federal poll .

"In the coastal redwood forests of central California, scientists trying to unravel the mystery surrounding the reproductive problems of dozens of endangered condors think they have uncovered the culprit: the long-banned pesticide DDT. The soaring scavengers with wingspans wider than NBA players are tall were reintroduced to the rugged coast of Big Sur in 1997 after a century-long absence. Upon arrival, the birds found plenty to eat, with dead California sea lions and other marine mammals littering the craggy shoreline. While a good food source, sea lion blubber often has high levels of DDT, a pesticide banned in 1972 that has proven to be a persistent pollutant because it accumulates in bodies of creatures throughout the food chain when animals eat one another. Endangered: Condors on California's central coast are having reproductive problems because of DDT . Once used widely in agriculture, DDT was banned because it is a human toxin considered a possible carcinogen by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Kelly Sorenson, executive director of Ventana Wildlife Society and a co-author of a new study on condors, said researchers who spent six years studying their reproductive problems have 'established a strong link' to DDT in the birds' food source. The peer-reviewed paper written by 10 condor experts, including biologists from the Los Angeles and Santa Barbara zoos and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, is being published this month in the University of California journal 'The Condor.' 'In science, rarely is anything definitive but we've established a strong link between ... DDT and eggshell thinning in California condors,' said Mr Sorenson. Dinner time: Condors feed on the remains of a marine mammal on a beach in Big Sur . The eggshell mystery began in 2006, when a biologist inspecting a condor nest in the cavity of a redwood tree on the central California coast found the first thin shell. Over the next six years, the scientists observed condors feeding on dozens of sea lions, and found that the Big Sur condor population had a low hatching success — just 20-40 percent — for 16 nesting pairs. In contrast, 70-80 percent of southern California condors in the Tejon area had hatched successfully over the same time. The southern California condors are inland, and sea lions are not a food source. Biologists familiar with the ravages of DDT in bird populations immediately suspected the widely used pesticide as a factor. Tests since the 1970s have found high levels of DDT in sea lions; and studies have linked DDT's metabolized version, DDE, to egg shell thinning in birds, including brown pelicans and bald eagles. Majestic: Condors wingspans are wider than NBA players are tall . The condor study attributed at least eight of 16 egg failures to thinning from DDT. One shell found crushed in a nest was 54-percent thinner than normal. Thinning can also allow bacteria to more easily enter the eggs. But why did the sea lions have such high DDT levels in the first place? The scientists theorize that the sea mammals were exposed when they migrated to the central coast from southern California, where the Montrose Chemical Corp. dumped DDT with impunity for decades until the 1970s. The Montrose plant and the ocean off Palos Verdes where it dumped DDT are now listed as Environmental Protection Agency 'Superfund' sites. Less hatching: California condor eggs hatch less than half as much on the central coast than they do to the south . 'A vast majority of California sea lions have spent at least a portion of their lives in the waters of southern California, which is the most DDT-contaminated coastal environment in the world,' Mr Sorenson said. 'Northward movements of sea lions provide a pathway of DDT to condors in central California.' The study's authors and other experts agree that lead ammunition, not DDT, is the main threat to the survivability of condors. But Jesse Grantham, a former condor program coordinator for Fish and Wildlife who did not participate in the study, called the paper's findings helpful scientific evidence that will add to the overall picture of threats facing condor recovery. Another former condor program manager, Noel Snyder, was critical of the DDT study, however. He said it only looks closely at one potential cause of reproductive problems — DDT — and fails to properly evaluate the potential effects of other contaminants and factors that may be involved and more important. 'DDT is not the only thing that causes . eggshell thinning, and the authors of the paper don't present a . significant correlation of DDT with the thinning found, and thus do not . do a convincing job of linking DDT with the happenings in Big Sur.' Big Sur: Though beautiful, Big Sur is contaminated with DDT . Study author and Ventana wildlife biologist Joe Burnett defended the team's work, saying all data pointed to the pesticide as the problem. 'We collected data on many different environmental toxins but none, other than DDE, were even in the ballpark known to cause reproductive failure in birds,' Mr Burnett said. In the final analysis, the study's authors say the DDT problem will fade over time. 'Like bald eagles and other bird species previously affected by DDT, the thickness of condor eggshells should recover as contamination declines in the coastal environment,' said co-author Robert Risebrough, an expert on the effects of DDT on birds.","DDT pesticide was banned in 1972, but still pollutes the environment .
Despite the danger posed to the environment, it was only banned because it was considered carcinogenic to humans .

"Only one in 50 people eligible for the government’s free parenting classes have taken advantage of the scheme, official figures have revealed. A £5million pilot was set up in a number of poor areas following the 2011 riots in England. Parents of under-fives would be able to claim £100 vouchers to attend classes covering discipline, diet, exercise, family rows, bullying and preparing children for school. But just two per cent of families have signed up since it was launched seven months ago. David Cameron (left) introduced the free parenting classes after the 2011 riots but Shadow Children's Minister Sharon Hodgson accused the Prime Minister of making ordinary families bear the brunt of cuts to services . Many of those who did attend classes quickly lost interest. One in five quit the courses before they had completed them. Last week one of the providers withdrew their services, complaining about poor turn-out and red tape. Labour seized on the statistics yesterday to attack the Prime Minister’s record on ‘family friendly’ policies. Shadow Children’s Minister Sharon Hodgson said: ‘David Cameron claimed this would be the most family friendly Government ever, but he’s made ordinary families bear the brunt of cuts to services and financial support, and now his flagship parenting programme is in chaos. ‘The major issue with the parenting class scheme is that it will never reach those families who need the most help. That is why Sure Start centres and outreach programmes are so important, but this government has slashed the budget by more than 40 per cent, with the most deprived areas facing the biggest cuts. ‘David Cameron promised he would provide high quality support for parents but he has failed.’ A total of 22,000 free classes in four pilot areas - Middlesbrough, Bristol, Camden in London and High Peak in Derbyshire - were announced under the scheme. Parents would pick up vouchers from Boots stores and health workers, entitling them to ten two-hour sessions with organisations such as the National Childbirth Trust. But children’s charity Montessori St Nicholas last week pulled out of the scheme after just 32 parents turned up. Problems had included poor marketing and problems with the issuing of vouchers, it said. Another provider has complained interest has been slack due to lack of publicity, the Observer said yesterday[SUN]. Another measure announced last year alongside the parenting classes was a £3.4 million website. Parents who signed up to it would receive information by text message and email on how to bring up children after the Prime Minister said it was ‘ludicrous’ that people receive more training when learning to drive. But he was forced to defend the plans amid concerns about an expanding ‘nanny state’. Other government proposals to face criticism include the tax-free childcare vouchers worth £1,200 a year per child that are only available to families with two earners. And there has been widespread criticism of cuts to child benefit that take effect in any family where an individual earns more than £50,000. Families where two parents both earn just under that sum will be unaffected, meaning they can be paid almost £100,000 without losing any benefits. The Department for Education said: ‘The CANparent trial... is still being successfully delivered by 13 of the original 14 providers.’","A £5million pilot was set up following 2011 riots in England .

"President Barack Obama brushed aside sharp European criticism on Monday, . suggesting that all nations spy on each other as the French and Germans . expressed outrage over alleged U.S. eavesdropping on European Union diplomats.

The . statement could not be independently authenticated as being from Snowden . himself. Wikileaks is the anti-secrecy group that has adopted Snowden and his . cause. Scroll down for video . Scrambling: US President Barack Obama went on the defensive Monday, saying all countries spy on one another . Obama, in an African news conference with Tanzanian . President Jakaya Kikwete, said the U.S. would provide allies with information . about new reports that the National Security Agency had bugged EU offices in . Washington, New York and Brussels. But he also suggested such activity by . governments would hardly be unusual. 'We should stipulate that every intelligence service -not . just ours, but every European intelligence service, every Asian intelligence . service, wherever there's an intelligence service - here's one thing that . they're going to be doing: They're going to be trying to understand the world . better, and what's going on in world capitals around the world,' he said. 'If . that weren't the case, then there'd be no use for an intelligence service.' The latest issue concerns allegations of U.S. spying on . European officials in the German news weekly Der Spiegel. French President . Francois Hollande on Monday demanded that the U.S. immediately stop any such . eavesdropping and suggested the widening controversy could jeopardize next . week's opening of trans-Atlantic trade talks between the United States and .

Even before the latest disclosures, talks at the upcoming . free-trade sessions were expected to be fragile, with disagreements surfacing . over which items should be covered or excluded from an agreement. The United . States has said there should be no exceptions. But France has called for . exempting certain cultural products, and other Europeans do not appear eager to . give up longtime agricultural subsidies. Obama said the Europeans 'are some of the closest allies . that we have in the world.' But he added, 'I guarantee you that in European . capitals, there are people who are interested in, if not what I had for . breakfast, at least what my talking points might be should I end up meeting with . their leaders. That's how intelligence services operate.' Nonetheless, Obama said he'd told his advisers to 'evaluate . everything that's being claimed' and promised to share the results with . allies. Meanwhile, the Interfax news agency said a Russian consular . official has confirmed that Snowden had asked for asylum in Russia. Interfax cited Kim Shevchenko, the duty officer at the . Russian Foreign Ministry's consular office in Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport, as . saying that Snowden's representative, Sarah Harrison, handed over his request on . Sunday. Snowden, in legal limbo, is believed to have been in the . airport's transit zone since his arrival from Hong Kong on June 23.

So I can confirm . that.' Putin didn't mention any Snowden effort to seek asylum in . Russia, and spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to say what the Russian response . might be. Putin insisted that Snowden wasn't a Russian agent and that Russian . security agencies hadn't contacted him. Three U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity . because they weren't authorized to publicly discuss the Snowden case, said . Washington's efforts were focused primarily on persuading Russia to deport . Snowden either directly to the United States or to a third country, possibly in . eastern Europe, that would then hand him over to U.S. authorities. In a sign of the distrust the latest report had revealed, . the German government said it had launched a review of its secure government . communications network and the EU's executive, the European Commission, ordered 'a comprehensive ad hoc security sweep.'

"Downton Abbey fans can now bring the post-Edwardian look into their own homes after the paint used on set of the hit series went on sale to the general public. The deep shades of grey, used in the kitchen on the period TV drama, were chosen by producers because they were colours commonly used at the time. The authentic colours were whipped up from recipes that are over 100 years old and have been kept in production by an historic paint company. Authentic: The kitchen in Downton Abbey, pictured here, was painted using deep grey tones that were chosen to reflect colours that were popular during the Edwardian and post-Edwardian era . Back in time: Now Mylands, a company who specialises in recreating vintage lacquers using traditional recipes of the time, has created two shades that will allow modern home-owners to replicate the Downton look, above, for themselves . The hues, Empire Grey and Amber Grey, are made using earth pigments and ground up marble to create the traditional look. They were created by paint company Mylands, who have been mixing different lacquers since 1884 using techniques that date back to the Georgian and Edwardian times. The paints were used to decorate the stately home’s kitchen, one of the main settings of the show which follows the lives of the aristocratic Crawley family. After the success of Downton Abbey the two stunning shades are now on sale to the general public so that people can recreate the style in their own houses. Prices start from £18.50 for one litre of paint. Get the look: The kitchens on the set of the popular television show,  filmed at Highclere Castle, were painted using deep gray tones created especially for set designers by Mylands, who are now making the paint available for the general public to buy . Classic: Empire Grey and Amber Grey were whipped up using recipes that dated back more than 100 years . The award-winning series is filmed at Highclere Castle near Newbury, Berks, and Ealing Studios in London. A much anticipated fourth series, starring Hugh Bonneville and Elizabeth McGovern, is due to air this autumn. A spokeswoman for Mylands, based in South London, said: 'We started trading in 1884 with a shop in Stradwell selling paints and wood finishes. 'We began supplying them to theatres and art galleries and started selling paint to film and television companies since the 1920s. 'The founder, John Myland, used recipes for a lot of really old, incredible colours dating back to the Georgian and Medieval times from local traders. 'We have used these recipes since then and we believe that it is how authentic our colours are that make us so popular. 'Our paints are also made from ground marble which gives them a wonderful matte finish. 'We have been selling paint to the production team behind Downton Abbey since it started in 2010, and after its success we decided to sell them to the general public. 'People can now achieve true Downton Abbey style by using authentic paint that is made exactly how it was 100 years ago with earth pigments.'","Greys used by producers chosen to reflect hues popular at the time .

"A widely-used anti-depressant could help ease the symptoms of Alzheimer's sufferers, a study has found. The drug Citalopram - sold under the brand names Celexa and Cipramil - significantly relieved agitation in a group of patients with the condition. It helped to reduce their emotional distress, excessive movement, aggression and disruptive irritability. Treatment: Citalopram could help ease the symptoms of Alzheimer's sufferers, a study has found. The drug - sold under the brand names Celexa and Cipramil - significantly relieved agitation in patients with the condition . The drug, known as Citalopram Hydrobromide, was also found to be safer than the antipsychotic drugs currently used to treat the condition - with a lower risk of strokes or heart attacks. It was tested on 186 Alzheimer's patients with varying symptoms during clinical trials at Johns Hopkins University and seven other American and Canadian academic medical centres. Researchers found the drug produced irregular heart beats in some patients - but the risk was lower than that of antipsychotic drugs. Antipsychotics, which are often used as . first-line medications for Alzheimer’s-related agitation, can significantly . increase the risk of strokes, heart attacks and death in sufferers. Benefits: It helped to reduce sufferers' emotional distress, excessive movement and disruptive irritability . Dr Constantine Lyketsos, who led the study, said the popular anti-depression could be a 'safer' choice of medication for Alzheimer's patients. 'If the agitation is not responding to non-medication treatments and your patient’s agitation isn’t improving, there are no great options,' he said. 'But here’s another medication choice that might be safer than other medications and seems to be just as effective.' Researcher: Dr Constantine Lyketsos said the popular anti-depression could also be a 'safer' choice of medication for Alzheimer's patients . During the study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, patients initially underwent tests to define the extent of their agitation, memory and other cognitive skills. The stress levels of their caregivers were also measured as this is a factor strongly linked to the well-being of those with Alzheimer’s. The patients - all of whom had previously experienced no adequate symptom relief with non-medical therapies or other antipsychotic drugs - were then separated into two groups. Over the next nine weeks, 50 per cent took increasing doses of citalopram that peaked at 30 milligrams per day, while the rest took a placebo. At the end of the study, the same set of tests was given, along with electrocardiograms. Dr Lyketsos said the results showed that 40 per cent of patients on Citalpram had experienced 'considerable' relief from agitation symptoms - compared to just 26 per cent of patients who took the placebo. The caregivers for these patients also reported less stress. However, Dr Lyketsos said patients on the anti-depressant were found to have slightly decreased cognitive function - adding: 'It was not huge, but measureable. That introduces a tradeoff.' Patients on Citalopram also had longer QTc intervals - a measure of abnormal heart function that increases the risk of heart attacks. But Dr Lyketsos added antipsychotic medications also used to treat agitation increase heart attack risk as well - perhaps even more substantially. Dr Lyketsos and his colleagues now hope to carry out further tests to determine whether a lower dose of Citalopram might be just as effective in treating Alzheimer’s-related agitation - but with less risk for cognition and heart function.","Drug Citalopram significantly relieved agitation in Alzheimer's patients .

"A New York clothing tycoon who confessed an affair to his wife after suspecting he had been caught cheating on camera, is taking his landlord to court. George Otero is hoping to squeeze millions out of his landlord on the claim that his privacy was breached. He claims his marriage was ruined by a small camera that - unbeknownst to him - had been set up across the hall and may have caught him having an affair. Luxury living: George Otero lived in this West Village apartment with his wife Georgia . The camera was placed there by landlord . Chaim Babad to confirm whether the building located at 241 Avenue of the . Americas in the city’s West Village was Otero’s primary residence, . Babad’s lawyer Jordan Sklar admitted in State Supreme Civil Court. The New York Daily News reported . that the camera, recording all the comings and goings at Otero's place, . may have captured an extramarital affair that Otero had been having . while his wife worked at his clothing business a few blocks north of the . apartment. In 2010 Otero discovered that a small box across the hall was actually a spy cam - pointed right at his door. It is unclear if the camera had picked up his dalliances, but concerned that the film may caught him cheating on his wife Georgia, Otero decided to confess the affair to her. Otero's lawyer Leonard Flamm told the Daily News: 'George concluded that Babad had the woman on camera and therefore it would come out.' 'He decided to inform his wife of . this visitor. He wanted to break it to her rather than have her learn it . from third parties. He felt it would better if the story came from . him.' Their marriage has been anything but blissful ever since, Flamm told the paper. Caught in the act: After a camera facing Otero's door was discovered, he was forced to admit to his wife that he had been cheating . But while the Oteros may be on the outs, that’s not stopping them from joining forces in a huge lawsuit against Babad. The couple is demanding $5million each from Babad, as well as $10,000 a year in psychiatric care, $2,500 a month for another apartment and $42,000 a year to pay for the employee Otero was hired to replace his wife, who quit her job when he told her of the affair. The paper reported that despite the ongoing case, the camera is still there. In court papers obtained by the News, Babad's lawyer Jordan Sklar said: 'If (Otero) wished to engage in intimate sexual activity in the open doorway of their apartment that is connected to a common hallway, he cannot reasonably expect that such conduct remains ""private.""'

"A legal bid to end 'slopping out' in British prisons could force the Government to spend hundreds of millions of pounds to upgrade its jails. The lawsuit has been launched by child rapist Roger Gleaves, who claims that the practice breaches his human rights. If successful, the case will force the Government to ensure that in-cell toilets are available 24 hours a day in all the country's prisons. Abolished: But slopping out still happens in some British prisons . Slopping out - the use of a bucket as a toilet when there is no in-cell sanitation at a prison - was formally abolished in the UK in 1996. But a report by the National Council of Independent Monitoring Boards published in August last year revealed that 10 UK prisons are still occasionally using the system. Convict: Roger Gleaves claims that being denied access to a toilet breaches his human rights . Gleaves, who served time at HMP Albany on the Isle of Wight, claims his human rights were violated by the 'degrading' process of sometimes having to use a bucket as a toilet in his cell during the night. He is joined in his claim by fellow ex-Albany inmates, Peter Kirby and Desmond Grant, and should the trio succeed the floodgates will open for more than 300 other ex-cons bringing similar actions. Because of the financial difficulty of making alterations to some jails, especially those built in the Victorian era, the practice of slopping out still persists in a number of prisons when normal systems break down. But now the claim spearheaded by Gleaves, which has reached the High Court, is seeking to force the extinction of slopping out, whatever the cost. Should it succeed, lawyers say, the Government will have to spend many millions 'rebuilding' the offending jails. Prisoners are threatening legal action against prison chiefs because they only get one TV channel showing Premiership football. Inmates can get Sky Sports 1 in their cells, but have lodged a formal complaint to try and access other subscription sports channels. A row broke out yesterday over their demand for 'sports rights', with an MP saying many people on the outside cannot afford the Sky channels. Bosses at the HMP Parc in Bridgend, South Wales, confirmed prisoners get Sky Sports 1 in their cells for good behaviour. But warders at the Category B prison say they can't afford Sky Sports at home - while the prisoners get it for free. One warder said: 'They have TV piped into their cells and can spend all day watching Sky Sports 1. 'But they're hacked off because they don't have Sky Sports 2 and 3. They've even been moaning it is a breach of their human rights. 'It's a cushy number. I've stayed in hotels that don't have the facilities the prisoners get here.' MP David Davies, chairman of the Welsh Affairs select committee in the House of Commons, said: 'I am aghast that we are paying for prisoners to watch Sky TV. 'It beggars belief that they are complaining about this - I haven't even got Sky Sports myself. What next? Will prisoners be given a box at the Millennium Stadium for rugby matches? 'People should not be put in prison to spend their days watching expensive satellite packages. They should be educated and learn skills for their rehabilitation when they come out.' Gleaves was jailed for 15 years in 1998 . after being convicted of rape, attempted rape, incitement of one boy to . rape another, and three counts of indecent assault. Nick Armstrong, barrister for Kirby and Grant, said after a pre-trial review of the case that the Government was seeking to block the move for financial reasons. 'These claims are not really about damages - it is a matter of principle, and trying to get the system changed,' said Mr Armstrong. 'That is why the Government is so concerned - because they would have to start rebuilding prisons.' He added that there are some 328 similar claims waiting in the wings and that about 2,000 prisoners in the UK are affected. The claimants' solicitor said that renovating just one prison would cost close to £100million. 'In Albany Prison alone, reports conclude that it would cost upward of £12million to provide sanitation and, in doing so, the prison would either lose 700 cells, or need £70million to replace them,' he said. Papers lodged with the court by Gleaves in 2006, kept secret from the public until last week, allege that the rapist was forced to endure a sub-standard lifestyle in Albany Prison between 2005 and 2006. The claim states that he was in continuous danger to his physical and emotional health because of the need to use a bucket and that Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights - the prohibition on inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment - was breached by the necessity to slop out. The Home Office's lawyer denies that toilet facilities are a human right, saying: 'The life of a prisoner must necessarily be controlled.' The case is set to begin at the High Court in London on November 14, and will be the first time the courts in England and Wales have judged the issue.",Convicts also threatening to sue over access to Sky Sports .
"A Taliban leader who was the target of a Nato helicopter that crashed leaving 38 dead last month has been killed, military leaders said today. Qari Tahir and a close associate were killed yesterday in Wardak province following a strike by coalition forces, NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) said in a statement. Tahir was being hunted last month by a CH-47 Chinook helicopter when it was shot down rocket-propelled grenade in Wardak province, in eastern Afghanistan. Avenged: Remains of the Chinook which crashed last month killing 30 U.S troops while they were on the hunt for Qari Tahir, who is now dead . Part of the helicopter's gun. The aircraft is though to have been shot down by insurgents who were using rocket-propelled grenades . The crash killed 38 people, including 30 Americans. Many of the 30 Americans who died in the crash last month were Navy SEALs from the unit behind the killing of Al Qaeda's Osama Bin Laden. It was the biggest single loss of life for international forces in Afghanistan since the conflict began 10 years ago. August was the deadliest month ever for U.S. forces in the Afghanistan war after 67 troops died[ . related] . The insurgents behind the attack were later killed in an F-16 air strike but Tahir had remained at large. His death will be a breakthrough for U.S. troops as they struggle to contain insurgents. 'Tahir coordinated ambush attacks against Afghan forces and led fighters under his control to conduct hijackings of convoy vehicles. Additionally, he facilitated abductions and held his hostages for ransom,' ISAF said. 'Tahir was the Taliban's top leader in Tangi Valley and was the target of a previous combined operation on August 5, 2011, that resulted in the loss of the CH-47 Chinook last month. 'He led a group of insurgent fighters throughout the valley and was known to use roadside bombs and rockets to intimidate the local populace.' The Chinook attack in August was the deadliest single mission of the Afghanistan war and the names. The troops came from two dozen states and all corners of the nation, mostly young men in their twenties and thirties. Florida, Minnesota, Hawaii and Massachusetts are just some of the states represented. The crash came amid fears that the country is far from stable even though U.S. and NATO forces have begun to leave Afghanistan. U.S. military officials have tried to counter those fears, saying that while the downing of the Chinook was a tragic setback, one crash will not determine the course of the war. The total number of troops from coalition forces now killed so far in the Afghanistan conflict is 2,730 according to independent website iCasualties.org.",Qari Tahir killed during strike by coalition forces .
"The typical British worker has a body effectively four years older than their actual age because of poor diet and lack of exercise, a study has found. Bad habits - such as drinking, smoking, and binge eating - combine with stress to accelerate the body's natural ageing process. Scientists found 86 per cent of us have bodies that appear physically older than a perfectly healthy individual of the same age. Smoking: Study found that bad habits combine with stress to speed up the body's natural ageing process . Adults are, on average, four years and 37 days older, the research by private medical insurer PruHealth with Vitality found. The researchers also managed to see clear health divides across the coutnry. They found that those living in the capital are the fittest, with 45 per cent doing the recommended two hours 30 minutes exercise each week. Residents . of the North East have the best diet, with 74 per cent eating an ideal . mix of fruit, vegetables, whole grains, and lean meat. They also smoke the least, with just one in four puffing on a cigarette, pipe, or cigar. However, Wales performed badly on nearly all indicators. Over . half of Welsh workers smoke (55 per cent), less than three-quarters (74 . per cent) exercise enough, and six in ten (60 per cent) are overweight. They . are also more likely to suffer from stress, high blood pressure, or . increased cholesterol, all of which can cause health problems. Those . in the West Midlands have the worst diet, with 43 per cent eating too . few healthy foods, or over-indulging on fat, sugar, and salt. The study found a direct correlation between income and health, with lifestyle risk factors more common among lower-earners. In fact, those with the highest salaries have a health age almost two years younger than those on the lowest. People in Wales are in the poorest condition, having a health age of five years six months older than their actual age. Those in London are healthiest, prematurely ageing by just three years two months. The study analysed lifestyle, behavioural, and clinical risk factors, using data from 10,000 workers. They looked at patients' weight, diet, exercise, smoking, alcohol intake, stress, cholesterol, and blood glucose levels, and blood pressure. And they used that to draw up a 'health map' of Britain, which shows Londoners are the slimmest, with 65 . per cent in the healthy weight range.

"Like most youngsters, their play can get a little wild. But five-month-old grizzly bear Bam Bam and 16-month-old chimpanzee Vali are the most unlikely friends. For while together they resemble a pair of cuddly toys, they would normally live on different continents. And when they grow up, Bam Bam is likely to be about nine times the size of his chimp pal. But the young males have been inseparable since being introduced at the Myrtle Beach Safari park in South Carolina, where they were born. Bam Bam the grizzly bear cub and Vali the chimp have become firm friends . The five-month-old bear and 16-month-old chimp live at the Myrtle Beach Safari Park in South Carolina . The pair love to play together and have been best of friends since they were introduced . Visitors delight in watching them wrestling and playing tag. In the wild, Bam Bam would live in the wilds of North America, while Vali’s natural home is the jungle of central Africa. Park owner Bhagavan Antle said staff decided to see whether the pair would hit it off when Bam Bam reached the same size as Vali – even though bears grow much faster than chimps. ‘We got them out there playing on a sunny day and they went on and on for hours,’ he said. ‘Neither of them wanted to quit. They would lie down and fall asleep at our feet, wake back up and start wrestling again.’ Dr Antle added: ‘Bam Bam has more power, but Vali tricks him. He will throw things at Bam Bam and run around him in circles.’ When the pair aren’t together, energetic Vali likes to help out his mum, while Bam Bam prefers a slower pace of life. ‘He likes nothing better than a bowl of sweet potatoes and chicken mash,’ added Dr Antle. Staff at the safari park now wonder whether the friendship can last. An adult grizzly can weigh up to 56st, while a mature male chimp tips the scales at just 9st. Staff are not sure how long the friendship will last as Bam Bam will quickly grow into a 56st adult bear, while Vali will reach only 9st .","Five-month-old grizzly bear cub and 16-month-old chimp are firm friends .

"The judge in the Oscar Pistorius trial has formally ordered the Paralympian to undergo psychiatric evaluation to establish whether he was criminally responsible on the night he killed his girlfriend. Judge Thokozile Masipa told Pistorius he must report to Pretoria's Weskoppies hospital, one of South Africa's top mental institutions, as an outpatient for up to 30 days, starting on May 26. The Judge named three of the experts - one for the defence and two appointed by the court - who will test whether Pistorius was 'capable of appreciating the wrongfulness of his action'. The results could offer a way for the double amputee to beat both the murder charge and a lesser one of culpable homicide (similar to manslaughter) if the court is convinced he was not of sound mind when he shot Reeva Steenkamp. Scroll down for video . Could he be acquitted of murder? Oscar Pistorius arrives at the high court in Pretoria accompanied by his uncle, Arnold, to hear a ruling by the judge in his murder trial to send him for up to 30 days of psychiatric tests . Conversely, if they find that his apparent Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) played no part in her death, the . state’s case that he murdered her could be strengthened. Pistorius must attend the hospital at 9am every weekday and will be evaluated by a panel of four mental health experts. He can leave every day at 4pm or when allowed by hospital authorities. Judge Masipa ruled that Pistorius's period of observation will not be more than 30 days. The ruling after an expert told the trial that he suffered from an anxiety disorder that made him 'hyper-vigilant'. Festival atmosphere: Local artists sing a tune called Whose Oscar Pistorius? outside the high court in Pretoria . Psychiatrist . Dr Merryll Vorster, for the defence, said that Pistorius's condition is . linked to his disability and meant that he was prone to fight, rather . than take flight, in the presence of perceived danger. It means that the trial - already on its 33rd day - will now be delayed until June 30. The decision by Judge Masipa followed a request for a psychiatric evaluation by the chief prosecutor, Gerrie Nel. Mr Nel questioned why the defense decided to ask Dr Vorster to testify on behalf of the Olympic runner. He has suggested that the trial is not going well for Pistorius and that his lawyers are floating the idea that a disorder contributed to Steenkamp's shooting and that therefore Pistorius bears less responsibility for her death. Pistorius says he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder when he shot her through the closed door of a toilet cubicle. Prosecutors say he killed her in anger after an argument. In asking for another professional evaluation of Pistorius's mental state, Nel appeared to be trying to ward off any attempt by the defense to say Pistorius should be treated favorably by the court because of a mental condition linked to his disability. Professor . Craig Jackson, Head of Psychology at Birmingham City University, . explained to MailOnline more about the condition that it's claimed Oscar . Pistorius has. 'Hyper-vigilance . is more of a behavioural symptom of wider psychological problems than . an actual psychiatric condition in itself,' he said. 'Hyper-vigilance . is when an individual is in a chronic state of high anxiety and arousal . and is constantly scanning their surroundings - the environment they . are in, as well as friends and the people they encounter - for threats. 'This . is often as the result of suffering a traumatic or frightening . experience. After a while this state becomes second nature to the . fearful individual and begins to shape their routine behaviours - for . example always checking behind closed doors when entering a room, or . assessing new places for the nearest emergency exit. 'Those . who are hyper-vigilant are often easily startled, suffer from poor . sleeping patterns, may have difficulty concentrating, and can be quite . quarrelsome, spontaneous and irritable. 'Hyper-vigilance . is one of the symptoms required in order for psychiatrists to make a . diagnosis of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) alongside other . symptoms of intense fear such as avoidance, re-experience, flashbacks . and intense arousal. 'Not . everyone who suffers traumatic events will go on to develop PTSD or . hyper-vigilance, and there may be other underlying personality factors . or past experiences that make it more likely to manifest in some rather . than others, such as narcissism or high intelligence.'","Paralympian must report to top mental hospital at 9am every weekday .

"Snack tactics: Knowing where to order your french fries can make all the difference to your waistline . Whether loaded with chili and cheese, or served simply with lashings of salt, the humble french fry is undoubtedly America's favourite deep-fried treat. But knowing where to order the popular snack can make all the difference to your waistline, as a new book reveals that servings can vary wildly in terms of fat and calorie content. Researchers for Eat This, Not That! 2013: The No-Diet Weight Loss Solution found that one portion can differ by as many as 1,200 calories. McDonald's french fries were . surprisingly among the healthiest on offer at 230 calories and 11g of . fat per small serving, however a plate of Chili's . Texas Cheese Fries with Chili and Ranch is a serious diet-buster at . 2,150 calories, with a staggering 144g of fat and 6,080mg sodium. Loaded . fries aren't all bad though - if yours aren't complete without a layer . of melted cheese, then head to Steak 'n' Shake instead, where a small Bacon Cheese French Fries comes in at a rather less terrifying 360 calories and 20g fat. Thicker-cut steak fries are the safest way to play it on a restaurant menu, the Eat This Not That team reveals, as the higher ratio of potato to oil cuts the fat content down significantly. That does not appear to be the case at TGI Friday's though, as the chain's Parmesan Steak Fries have almost double the fat of its regular fries at 49g and 660 calories. Serving size: McDonald's french fries (left) were surprisingly among the healthiest on offer at 230 calories and 11g of fat per small serving, while Five Guys' huge portions (right) mean there are 1,474 calories in a large . Instead, choose KFC's potato wedges, at 290 calories and 15g of fat, just 2.5g of which is saturated. Novelty value: Jack in the Box serves the lowest-calorie curly fries . Men's Health editor-in-chief David Zinczenko, who is . behind the Eat This Not That series, told MailOnline . that the trick to having your fries and eating them is to exercise . moderation. 'The occasional order of fries isn’t so bad, but most people treat . deep-fried potatoes like a food group,' he said. 'One out of every six restaurant . orders comes with fries, and more than 50per cent of American potatoes . pass through a deep fryer before being sold. When researchers look at . the effect of this, it becomes clear that there’s a direct connection . between french fries and weight gain.' The new guide also compared sweet potato fries, which many might believe is a healthier alternative. The exact opposite is the case at the Cheesecake Factory, however, where a portion of sweet potato fries is 400 calories more than its regular fries. FAST FOOD FRIES . McDonald’s is awfully proud of its fries. So proud, in fact, that the . chain bought the rights to be the exclusive fry purveyor at the Olympic . Games in London. And perhaps it should be proud - the spuds taste great . and they have fewer calories than any other fast food chain’s. Five Guys . is also proud of its fries, but that pride manifests itself in . elephantine portions that threaten to tip your table and will most . certainly tip your bathroom scale. Make your choice accordingly. BEST: McDonald's French Fries (small) WORST: Five Guys Fries (large) LOADED FRIES . Let’s be frank: topping fries with cheese, ranch, bacon, gravy, sour . cream, or any similar high-fat accoutrement is the kind of innovation . that turns skinny people chubby.

BEST: Steak ‘n Shake Bacon Cheese French Fries (small) WORST: Chili's Texas Cheese Fries with Chili and Ranch . STEAK FRIES . Wedges tend to be a smarter option: You pack more soft potato inside . each greasy exterior, which ultimately leads to fewer calories for the . same amount of food.

"Amber Jay Vinson, the second nurse to be diagnosed with Ebola, had a lo-grade fever and boarded a flight from Cleveland, Ohio, to Dallas, anyway -  just hours before she was hospitalized with the deadly disease. Now, CDC officials are trying to track down all 132 passengers who were aboard Frontier Airlines Flight 1143 on Monday with Ms Vinson over fears they could all have been exposed to the virus. Ms Vinson traveled home to Ohio to plan her wedding and visit her mother last Friday, despite being one of the 76 medical workers from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital under observation by the Centers for Disease Control. She had treated Thomas Eric Duncan, the Ebola 'patient zero.' Health officials say she was told she was at risk for exposure to the disease but flew on a commercial airline anyway. Everyone who was on board the plane is urged to call 1-800-CDC-INFO (1-800-232-4636) so that they can be interviewed by CDC doctors to determine who is at risk for possible exposure to Ebola. Scroll down for video . This is  the Frontier Airlines plane the Amber Jay Vinson flew hours before she took ill. It made five flights, ferrying passengers to Florida and Atlanta and back, before being pulled from service . Ms Vinson flew home to plan her wedding and visit her mother. She had a fever of 99.5 degrees, but boarded a plane from Cleveland to Dallas, anyway . Protecting themselves: Frontier Airlines workers at Cleveland-Hopkins International Airport wore latex gloves on Wednesday after it was revealed an Ebola-infected nurse flew out of the airport on Monday night . Ms Vinson is currently in stable condition at Texas Presbyterian Hospital, though doctors are preparing to transfer her to an infectious disease ward at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. She flew home to her family in Northeast Ohio on Friday, despite CDC advice that says people being monitored for Ebola should stay away from public transportation, officials said. 'She should not have traveled on a commercial airline,' CDC Director Dr Thomas Frieden said in a news conference today. Dr Frieden, however, did not say whether she was told not to travel by CDC officials. Ms vinson was on Flight 1143 returning to Dallas just hours before reporting the first symptoms of Ebola. 'Because of the proximity in time between the evening flight and first report of illness the following morning, CDC is reaching out to passengers,' the agency said in a statement. She had a fever of 99.5 degrees, though patients are told not to be concerned about Ebola symptoms until the fever reached 101.5 degrees. Patients infected with Ebola are not contagious until after they begin to show symptoms - which can take anywhere from two days to three weeks. Public health officials are concerned that Ms Vinson may have been contagious on the flight. Flight 1143 took off from Cleveland-Hopkins International Airport about 6.30pm eastern time on Monday and landed shortly after 8pm at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. The next morning, she showed up to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital with a fever. She was isolated and tested for Ebola. Positive test results came back today. Frontier said it is disinfecting the plane that carried Ms Vinson and has removed it from service - though not before it made four more flights around the country . The plane Ms Vinson flew on when she may have been contagious made four more flights full of passengers before it was removed from service. The plane returned to Cleveland from Dallas, then flew to Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood Intentional Airport in Florida, then to Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport . Workers sealed up Amber Jay Vinson's apartment on Wednesday morning after the announcement that the nurse has been diagnosed with Ebola . CDC officials have refused to offer an exact timeline for when Ms Vinson began experiencing symptoms - though it's likely less than 12 hours between the time she was on the plane to the time she showed up at the hospital. The plane that carried Ms Vinson has been removed from service and disinfected twice. However, it made five more flights with passengers before the CDC notified Frontier of the possible Ebola exposure. On Tuesday morning, the plane, an Airbus A320, took off from Dallas and returned to Cleveland. It then flew to Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport then back to Cleveland. Then Cleveland to  Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson, the busiest airport in the world, and back to Ohio. It returned to service later today and lifted off for Denver this afternoon. WKYC-TV showed a picture of the aircraft, believed to be the plane in question at a boarding gate at the Cleveland airport. The CDC has not said anyone on those flights is at risk of catching the virus and has emphasized that 'the risk is very low' even for the passengers on the Frontier Airlines flight. WHEN IS EBOLA CONTAGIOUS? Only when someone is showing symptoms, which can start with vague symptoms including a fever, flu-like body aches and abdominal pain, and then vomiting and diarrhea. HOW DOES EBOLA SPREAD? Through close contact with a symptomatic person's bodily fluids, such as blood, sweat, vomit, feces, urine, saliva or semen. Those fluids must have an entry point, like a cut or scrape or someone touching the nose, mouth or eyes with contaminated hands, or being splashed. That's why health care workers wear protective gloves and other equipment. The World Health Organization says blood, feces and vomit are the most infectious fluids, while the virus is found in saliva mostly once patients are severely ill and the whole live virus has never been culled from sweat. The Texas Department of State Health Services said Sunday that a health-care worker who provided hospital care for the first patient to die from Ebola in the United States has tested positive for the virus. The worker was not identified and it was unclear what level of care the worker provided or when the health worker came into contact with the patient. It is the first known case of Ebola being transmitted in the U.S. WHAT ABOUT MORE CASUAL CONTACT? Ebola isn't airborne. Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said people don't get exposed by sitting next to someone on the bus. 'This is not like flu. It's not like measles, not like the common cold. It's not as spreadable, it's not as infectious as those conditions,' he added. WHO GETS TESTED WHEN EBOLA IS SUSPECTED? Hospitals with a suspected case call their health department or the CDC to go through a checklist to determine the person's level of risk. Among the questions are whether the person reports a risky contact with a known Ebola patient, how sick they are and whether an alternative diagnosis is more likely. Most initially suspicious cases in the U.S. haven't met the criteria for testing. HOW IS IT CLEANED UP? The CDC says bleach and other hospital disinfectants kill Ebola. Dried virus on surfaces survives only for several hours. The Ebola virus has survived on surfaces for up to six days in lab experiments, though most studies suggest it can on live a few hours. Ms Vinson is the second nurse who cared for Duncan to be diagnosed with Ebola. Nurse Nina Pham, 26, came down with the illness this weekend. Both women are at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, which treated Duncan as well. Vinson is being transferred to a special infectious disease unit, one of four in the country, for treatment. It is believed that she will soon be flown to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, which treated the first American Ebola patients Dr Kent Brantley and Nancy Writebol. Duncan, a Liberian national, died last week after becoming the first person to bring the Ebola to the United States from West Africa, where it has killed nearly 4,500 people. Stocks in major airlines slumped 4 to 6 percent in morning trading after the announcement. Republic Airways, Frontier's parent company, tumbled 4.7percent.","Amber Jay Vinson flew home to visit her family in Ohio, last Friday despite being monitored for possible Ebola exposure in Dallas, Texas .

"The United States has conclusive evidence that Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime has used chemical weapons against rebel forces and is now proposing a no-fly zone in the country. The use of weapons such as the nerve agent sarin crosses what President Barack Obama has called a 'red line' that would trigger greater American involvement in the crisis. In a telephone call with British Prime Minister David Cameron tonight, Obama will discuss their plan to warn Russian President and Syrian ally Vladimir Putin of the prospect of military intervention if he doesn't back down on Syria. The leaders are expected to warn Putin of the dangerous consequences of Russia's supporting Syria at the G8 conference in Northern Ireland, which begins on Monday. According to the Wall Street Journal, the White House is now considering arming the opposition fighters and enforcing a no-fly zone that could cost an estimated $50 million a day. Scroll down for video . Crisis: Syria's President Bashar al-Assad in his office in the capital Damascus on June 13, 2013.  The United States has conclusive evidence that Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime has used chemical weapons against rebel forces and is now proposing a no-fly zone in the country . The proposal to arm rebel forces may rely on creating the no-fly zone that would protect opposition fighters and refugees from Syrian government aircraft. An area stretching 25 miles into Syria could be enforced with planes flown from bases in neighboring Jordan. Sources told the Wall Street Journal that it would dangerous to supply and train the rebels without a no-fly zone to ward off Assad's forces. 'Unless you have a good buffer zone inside Syria, you risk too much,' a U.S. official told the paper. Injured: A video posted on Facebook and YouTube appears to show victims of a Syrian regime assault on Aleppo foaming at the mouth . Horrific: Experts believe that the injuries shown in the video are consistent with those sustained after a chemical weapon attack . Should the U.S. arm the Syrian rebels? Should the U.S. arm the Syrian rebels? Now share your opinion . 'We've prepared for many . contingencies in Syria,' said Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national . security adviser. 'We are going to make decisions on further actions on . our own timeline.' However, . Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., told reporters on Capitol Hill Thursday that . he had been told Obama was 'going to provide arms to the rebels.' The White House said the Assad regime . had used chemical weapons, including the nerve agent sarin, on a small . scale multiple times in the last year. Up . to 150 people have been killed in those attacks, the White House said, . constituting a small percentage of the 93,000 people killed in Syria . over the last two years. The Obama administration announced in April that it had 'varying degrees of confidence' that sarin had been used in Syria. Policing the skies: The White House is now planning a no-fly zone over Syria. French jets (pictured) enforced a similar zone over Libya in 2011 . But they said at the time that they had not been able to determine who was responsible for deploying the gas. The . more conclusive findings announced Thursday were aided by evidence sent . to the United States by France, which along with Britain, announced it . had determined that Assad's government had used chemical weapons in the . two-year conflict. Obama . has said repeatedly that the use of chemical weapons would cross a 'red . line' and constitute a 'game changer' for U.S. policy on Syria, which . until now has focused entirely on providing the opposition with . nonlethal assistance and humanitarian aid. Tension: Syrian rebel fighters belonging to the 'Martyrs of Maaret al-Numan' battalion leave their position after a range of shootings today . The White House said Congress has been notified of the new U.S. chemical weapons determination, as have international allies. Obama will discuss the assessments, along with broader problems in Syria, next week during the G-8 summit in Northern Ireland. Obama is also expected to press Russian President Vladimir Putin, Assad's most powerful backers, to drop his political and military support for the Syrian government. 'We believe that Russia and all members of the international community should be concerned about the use of chemical weapons,' Rhodes said. The U.S. has so far provided the Syrian rebel army with rations and medical supplies. Death toll: At least 93,000 people, including over 6,500 children, have been killed in Syria's civil war, the United Nations said on June 13, 2013, warning that the true death toll could be far higher . Destroyed: A Syrian man checking his destroyed house that was damaged by a Syrian forces air strike, in Idlib province, northern Syria . In April, the administration made a decision in principle to expand its military support to the opposition to include defensive items like night vision goggles, body armor and armored vehicles. That step was announced by Secretary of State John Kerry. The composition of the defensive military equipment is still being determined in consultation with the opposition military leadership and other nations that are supplying similar material. The UK - along with France - has reported repeated small-scale incidents of apparent chemical weapon use by regime forces to the United Nations investigation team. Both countries led a successful joint bid to lift an EU embargo on supplying arms to opposition forces although Prime Minister David Cameron stressed yesterday that no decision had been taken to arm the rebels. He is due to hold talks with Russian president Vladimir Putin at Downing Street on Sunday as part of efforts to break the international deadlock. The crisis will also be high on the agenda when they join other world leaders, including Mr Obama and French president Francois Hollande, at the G8 summit in Northern Ireland on Monday.Foreign Secretary William Hague discussed the crisis - which the United Nations now believes has cost at least 93,000 lives - with US counterpart John Kerry on Wednesday. He said after those talks that the international community must be 'prepared to do more' to up the pressure on the regime.

"A soldier who became infertile after being injured by a bomb in Afghanistan launched a bitter attack on the Ministry of Defence (MoD) last night after ‘heartless’ officials rejected his bid for a Forces sperm bank. Former soldier Rick Clement served fourteen years in The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment until he stepped on an IED in Afghanistan, losing his legs and sexual function. He wants the MoD to fund a sperm bank in case other military personnel end up like him . Sergeant Rick Clement, 35, began a campaign for the MoD to store samples provided by soldiers after a Taliban landmine blew him up in 2010, causing appalling injuries and leading to the loss of both of his legs. Sgt Clement’s injuries prevent him from having children or a sex life, and led to the break-up of his marriage – he and his fiancee Leanne Isaacs went ahead with their wedding after the blast only for the realities of his condition to drive them apart. The soldier, from Blackpool, said: ‘This is devastating news. 'I fear that, as a result of the MoD’s decision, more soldiers will be denied the pleasure of fathering children. ‘Many cannot afford the cost of storing their sperm privately. 'Others may take their fertility for granted. ‘The MoD has enough medical facilities to incorporate a sperm bank. 'I know what it is like to feel that you’re not a man any more. 'A guy can’t feel much worse than that, and I wouldn’t wish that on anyone. ‘The MoD has let soldiers down in a bid to save money, it is heartless.’ Almost a quarter of soldiers in the British Army are unfit to  fight on the front line, according to official figures. Some . 18,460 troops out of the Army’s current strength of 84,600 are unable . to fulfil their duties  due to injuries sustained in battle or in . training, or other long-term health problems. Last night, Colonel . Richard Kemp, who led British troops in Afghanistan, said: ‘Such a small . fighting strength puts us in the world’s third division of armies.’ Since . UK troops began fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2001, 7,222 . personnel have been  admitted to British-run field hospitals in the . country and a further 7,088 have been flown back to Britain for . treatment. From those totals, 610 personnel have been listed as . seriously wounded. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ‘The vast . majority of soldiers who are not fit to go on operations have only . temporarily been downgraded and will still be able  to deploy once they . recover. ‘Anyone who is unable to deploy still plays a vital role supporting operations and defence priorities.’ The MoD said that its decision was based on the ‘extremely low’ number of Service personnel who are infertile because of their wounds – 24  UK troops are unable to have children naturally for this reason. It would have to pay hundreds of pounds to store soldiers’ sperm at private clinics, with prices starting at £300 for freezing and a year’s storage. Female troops wishing to preserve egg cells face higher costs. Solicitor Hilary Meredith also attacked the MoD’s decision, saying: ‘The Government’s lack of commitment to assisting these seriously injured soldiers is hugely disappointing. 'The least they could do is allow these men the gift to father children post-injury, which would cost so little given the happiness this would bring.’ Sperm banks proved popular in Israel after the 1973 Yom Kippur war and were used by widows of soldiers belonging to the Israeli Defence Force. he MoD’s announcement comes after a woman won a High Court victory last month to stop her dead husband’s frozen sperm being destroyed. Beth Warren, 28, successfully challenged the time limit for the storage of sperm set by the UK’s fertility regulator. An MoD spokesman said: ‘Because the number of Service personnel suffering from serious groin injuries is extremely low, there are no current plans to introduce a system to store sperm or ova pre-deployment. For Queen and Country: Sgt Rick Clement from Blackpool, Lancashire lost both of his legs when he stepped on an IED whilst serving in Helmand . ‘However, advice is available for all personnel and we would encourage anyone interested in finding out more to speak to their chain of command.’ Although the MoD has refused to set up a sperm bank, the Army has improved the design of garments worn by troops to protect them.

"Strangler: Local transient Sergio Alvarez, 30, was arrested after witnesses say he strangled a brown pelican to death . A man who allegedly grabbed a pelican by its neck and strangled the bird with his bare hands caused a horrifying scene to beachgoers in California on Wednesday. Flagged down by a witness, officers in a Los Angeles County sheriff's patrol car responded to the monstrous attack allegedly carried out by 30-year-old local transient Sergio Alvarez near the Malibu Pier. 'The pelican flapped its wings in distress until its body went limp and died,' the sheriff's report obtained by LA Weekly read. Alvarez allegedly then hid the bird's body after its death but it was recovered by police with the help of witnesses. 'He said he was hungry. And he found the bird dead and was going to eat it,' Sergeant Michael Holland told City News Service of the man’s reasoning. He was arrested and booked for investigation of felony animal cruelty. He remains in jail with bail set at $20,000. Protected: The brown pelican is a full-protected species in California and removed from the endangered species list in 2009 (file photo) Hungry man: Speaking with Alvarez who was captured near the Malibu Pier, pictured, he told police he was hungry and found the bird already dead . The body of the brown pelican, previously listed as an endangered species, was taken by representatives of the California Wildlife Center. The birds are still fully-protected species in the state of California despite their removal from the endangered species list in 2009. Speaking with LA Weekly, Fish and Game spokesman Esther Burkeet said her department has never heard of anyone killing one of the birds, though shared a more gruesome act previously suffered by them. 'The worst thing we ever saw in the past was people cutting off their beaks ... in the mid-90s or so,' she said. 'Some people thought it might be the fishermen who didn't like the pelicans hanging out near their vessels.'","Local California transient Sergio Alvarez, 30, told police he was hungry but found bird dead the way it was ."
"It's seen as the ultimate month for sunshine and glorious weather - but August is also the month you're most likely to be struck by lightning. Research shows the summer month is the peak time for thunderstorms - and that sheltering away from the inclement weather does not stop you being hit. Findings from the Tornado and Storm Research Organisation (TORRO) show lightning can easily strike homes, as electrical currents surge through metal wires and pipes. August is the month that people are most likely to be hit struck by lightning, according to researchers from the Tornado and Storm Research Organisation (stock image) The organisation, which has been researching lightning, storms and tornados since it was founded in 1974, said almost as many people had been struck indoors as outdoors, even when windows and doors are closed. Derek Elsom and Jonathan Webb told the Times that a quarter of all indoor incidents took place while the person was either using or touching their landline phones - one of the most dangerous things to do during a thunderstorm . Researchers from TORRO revealed that 722 people were hit in Britain between 1988 and 2012, an average of 29 each year. It compiled the figures using lightning incidents from the media, NHS . reports and incidents sent in by the public. On average, this means two people are killed by lightning per year - though it is expected many more incidents go unreported. In 1982, as many as 14 people were killed by lightning. But there were no deaths . in 2000 or 2001 - the first year that had happened since . 1937. Researchers say being inside does not stop people being struck by lightning - and that a quarter of all indoor incidents take place while someone is using or touching the landline (stock pic) In England and Wales, about 80 per cent of those killed by lightning were men. That is believed men tend to work outdoors more than women, TORRO says. The organisation says there are around 300,000 ground strikes by lightning every year in Britain. On average, this means that someone is struck once every 6,000 strikes and someone is killed once every 100,000 strikes. A 'thunderstorm day' may see up to 10,000 ground strikes. One of the most exceptional days in lightning history was on 24 July 1994, when 85,000 ground strikes were produced, TORRO said. Their survey, published in the Royal Meteorological Society's journal Weather, also tackled widely held myths about lightning safety. Metal objects, such as necklaces and bracelets, do not attract lightning, but they do increase the risk of burns. Mobile phones and earphones do not draw lightning, but they too can leave burns and may help to pass electric current into the body and cause more serious injuries. Being sweaty can also lead to a greater risk of being hurt by the strike, as the moisture instantly vapourises. Sweaty feet can also make shoes explode, they say. But the number of victims has halved since the 1960s, as fewer people work outdoors and health and safety has improved.","The summer month is the peak time for thunderstorms in the UK .

"Clad in feathers, pearls, gems, flowers and bows, a pint-sized pack of chihuauas has been captured on camera dressed in finest couture. French photographer Sophie Gamand dresses the dogs in pieces designed by pet couturier Anthony Rubio, before taking their pictures for her new photographic series, Dog Vogue. Each photograph carefully captures the pooches pulling high-fashion poses and unique facial expressions as well as giving them the chance to show off their stylish new look. Glamour dog: All of Sophie's chihuahua models wear outfits created by dog couturier, Anthony Rubio . 'After discovering the incredible Dog . High Fashion scene in New York, I wanted to create a series that would . resemble what you see in human fashion magazines,' Sophie tells MailOnline. 'I organised a casting . of chihuahuas, because I thought they would be the most expressive for . this project, with their larger than life attitude. Also, they are so . tiny and their features are so small, they show the fashion very well (I . guess the petite size runs within dog fashion as well!). 'I invited . Anthony Rubio, a famous pet couturier, to design pieces for me. On each . shoot, he would bring his creations, all very detailed and exquisite, . and I would go through them, pairing them with each other and with . matching backgrounds, styling every photo like a stylist would do on a . Vogue shoot (I assume!).' 'The . experience was thrilling in itself, to create something new from and . with someone else's art, and then the photography part was also very . exciting. I tried and capture the dogs' expressions that would match the . outfits they were wearing, to create a whimsical gallery of characters. 'My . entire photography work is about pets and our relationship to them. I . am fascinated by the human/dog bond in particular, and all the things . that we subject dogs to, especially in a big city like New York. Dogs . have become more than animals, they are true life companion and often . replace spouse and children (it is very true in the world of dog . fashion). I am interested in challenging this bond, and what it says . about us as a society. 'Why are humans turning to animals to replace . relationships they can't form in the human world? Why are dogs accepting . anything from us? What is this bond made of? Love? Co-dependance? All . these questions fuel my work.' Unique: Each photo aims to capture the dogs pulling high fashion poses and unusual facial expressions . Resemblance: Some of the diva dogs look a little like members of the royal family as well as Hollywood starlets . 'As for dog fashion, it is quite a fascinating world as well,' adds Sophie. 'I discovered it a few years ago. These people gather in charity events, dress their dogs with custom made outfits that costs hundreds of dollars. Designers compete for best designs, dogs compete for best model, etc. As in child pageant though, even though the focus seems to be on the dog, the show is really all about the 'pawrents' (the owners of the doggies), and there is a lot of drama and fun behind the scene!' 'Models' appearing in the series include Bogie, Kimba, Amazing Grace, Daisy, Angel Song, Peach, Cosmo, Chester, Bleu, Sparky, Chai Latte, Coffee Bean and Diva. According to Sophie, her pet portraits go beyond capturing the interesting . features of dogs and reveals that she looks for 'soul, personality [and] . charisma' in her models. Writing on her website, she adds: 'Every dog is an individual. In . my mind, each one harbours a rich inner world of stories and dreams. 'As a . photographer, I aspire to create a window into that world and let that . richness emerge.' Over the . last three years, Sophie, who also creates reportage photos that go . behind the scenes at veterinary clinics and rescue homes, has focused . her projects on pets and their place in . society. And she's enjoyed plenty of success. Late last year her series Wet Dogs went viral online, and she . is now working on her first book.

"This is the ramshackle tent village set up by migrants near Calais as they wait for an opportunity to stow away on lorries bound for the UK. The refugees, who hail mostly from Afghanistan, Sudan, Iran and Eritrea, have even pitched a number of mosque tents - complete with rugs and books - in which to worship on the move. Many of them, including children, have travelled many hundreds - even thousands - of miles from their homelands, most often torn apart by war or political upheaval, in search of a better life for their families. Amid the squalor of this camp is a tree  with the names of migrants who have passed through poignantly scratched into its bark - the only lasting document that many of them were ever here. Mosque: The refugees, who hail mostly from Afghanistan, Sudan, Iran and Eritrea, have even pitched a number of mosque tents in which to worship on the move . Scroll down for video . Tent village: This is the ramshackle tent village set up by migrants near Calais as they wait for an opportunity to stow away on lorries bound for the UK . Peaceful: The mosques are complete with rugs and books and provide a haven away from the chaos of immigration centres where gang fights and crime are rife . Hard travel: Many of them, including children, have travelled many hundreds - even thousands - of miles from their homelands, often torn apart by war or political upheaval, in search of a better life for their families . Despite food centres set up by French aid organisations, Muslim emigres here prefer to cook their own food for fear what else is on offer might not be halal. Scattered about the camp are a number of well-thumbed English-French dictionaries as refugees brush up on their language skills ahead of their attempt to enter the UK. But language is not the only barrier they will have to overcome when they try to illegally cross the English Channel. French police used tear gas on crowds of migrants this week in Calais when around 300 attempted to storm lorries heading for the Channel Tunnel. And violent clashes between rival migrant gangs competing for the best locations to board lorries are an almost daily occurrence. In prayer: This is another mosque on the edge of the forest near Calais . Own food: Muslim immigrants, who abstain from eating the food distributed by French aid organizations in case they may not be halal, cook their own food . Poignant: At the centre of the camp is a tree scratched with the names of migrants who have passed through -the only document for many that they were ever here . These pictures emerged three days after the French government announced plans for a new centre for migrants in Calais. Intended as a 'humanitarian response' to the growing number of people living rough in the area, the centre will offer mainly medical facilities. But residents warned that migrants would flock to the proposed facility. With the authorities promising legal advice for those seeking asylum in Britain, even the deputy mayor of Calais admitted it could serve as a hotspot for those seeking to cross the Channel. Sangatte was a controversial Red Cross centre located just outside the port that acted as a magnet for thousands of migrants before it was closed following riots in 2002. Official figures now put the number of migrants in Calais at 2,300 – up from 1,500 in August. Violent clashes between rival migrant gangs competing for the best locations to board lorries are an almost daily occurrence. Announcing the new centre yesterday, France's interior minister said he wanted to stop illegal camping in Calais and house asylum seekers throughout the country. Language barrier: A well-thumbed English-French dictionary lies by a campfire. But language is not the only barrier they will have to overcome when they try to illegally cross the English Channel . On the rise: Official figures now put the number of migrants in Calais at 2,300 – up from 1,500 in August . Growing: The migrant community here is growing as more arrives with hopes of finding a better life than the ones they left behind . Bernard Cazeneuve also said migrants wanting to apply for asylum in Britain would be offered legal advice to help them with their applications. But he insisted these measures would not encourage more migrants to arrive in Calais, as happened with Sangatte. The facility will be housed in a leisure centre – a summer school for children – with kitchens capable of catering for up to 500 people. There is also heating, toilets and showers. There are beds at the centre, but Mr Cazeneuve said only the most vulnerable, including mothers with children, would be allowed to use them. Hopes: Immigrants live in makeshift tents ahead of upcoming winter and bad weather conditions in a wooded area in Calais, northern France, adjacent to Calais ferry port where migrants mainly from Afghanistan, Sudan, Iran and Eritrea try to arrive to Britain . Passing time: Many pass the time by playing football in a field next to their camp . Away from violence: Violent clashes between rival migrant gangs competing for the best locations to board lorries are an almost daily occurrence . Mr Cazeneuve backed the centre 'with one condition – that the operating rules are clear and everyone demonstrates responsibility for the security of the site, and that it is protected from savage behaviour. 'We will make sure that the building of illegal camps is stopped'. Philippe Mignonet, the deputy mayor of Calais, said the centre could be a new Sangatte. 'Some are saying that it will and we can't do anything because Calais is already a magnet,' he said. 'Well, Calais is not. England is. Riot: French police used tear gas on crowds of migrants last week in Calais when around 300 attempted to storm lorries heading for the Channel Tunnel . Police stepped in when immigrants in Calais cause a disturbance, using canisters of tear gas on the camps as they throw stones and sticks over the fence, the police round up the immigrants and herd them back into the camp . Hopes: Immigrants trying to make there way across the English channel into the UK attempt to jump into lorry's as they line up at Calais . 'It was the same problem with Sangatte at the beginning. It was working well but it's the number of migrants which causes problems, not the migrants themselves. 'It could become a problem again at the new centre: I am not saying it will, but it could.' He said that housing migrants in centres around France would not work as they would go straight back to the Calais camp. 'When a camp is dismantled and migrants are sent to different parts of the country and told that they can claim asylum in France, they are back in Calais within a week,' he added.","These refugees hail mostly from Afghanistan, Sudan, Iran and Eritrea .

"A Danish television channel admitted yesterday it mistakenly used a screenshot from a computer game in a news report about Syria. News anchor Cecilie Beck presented a segment about the conflict in the Middle Eastern country while sitting in front of a picture taken from adventure game Assassin's Creed. Jacob Nybroe, head of news at TV2, has been forced to apologise after the blunder on February 26 was highlighted on social networking sites. TV2 news anchor Cecilie Beck presented a news segment on the preservation of Syria's heritage while sitting in front of a backdrop taken from the adventure computer game Assassin's Creed . Danish media reported the image had been found on YouTube and mistakenly thought to be genuine . Danish media reported that a graphic designer had pulled the image of a picturesque Damascus skyline from YouTube to use in the report. The feature was about the preservation of Syria's heritage and Danish news website Politiken reported that the employee believed it was a genuine picture. It is thought the image is from the first game in the Assassin's Creed series when the action is set in historic Damascus, as well as other parts of the Middle East. Mr Nybroe said he learned of the mistake this week following the online speculation. He said the incident is a 'reminder to us all of the importance of verifying the sources of pictures.' Mr Nybroe told Politiken that there . had been a 'clear-cut error' and that it would have been even more . serious had the employee taken the image directly from the computer . game. He added that the station has since implemented a new system so that correct images can be more easily found. The news segment opened with an appropriate image of the Syrian flag before switching to the screenshot . Damascus features heavily in the first of the popular adventure game series  Assassin's Creed . Last year, ITV was strongly criticised by Ofcom after it mistakenly used a scene from the video game Arma 2 in a programme about an IRA attack. Ofcom found the station to be in breach of broadcasting rules for claiming that the scene in Exposure: Gaddafi And The IRA was footage from an IRA film of IRA members attempting to shoot down a British Army helicopter in 1988. The footage had been taken from the internet and ITV apologised and said it had not intended to mislead viewers. In November 2012, ABC's Denver affiliate KMGH-TV also apologised after it broadcast a news segment in which it mistakenly ran a fake book cover alongside a story about the mistress and biographer of former CIA director David Petraeus. The Paula Broadwell biography called 'All In' had been offensively doctored. News director Jeff Harris called the incident 'a regrettable and an embarrassing error.'","Danish channel TV2 apologised after the error was highlighted online .

Charged: Tyler Hadley, seen here in his booking photo, has been charged as an adult for the killings of his parents . 'I'll get out,' he wrote to a friend. Hadley repeatedly complains of . depression in his letters to friends and family. In a letter to his . maternal grandparents last November, he wrote that he cries every day, . prays for forgiveness and feels bad about how his brother has been . affected by the killings.. 'I know he misses our parents and I . really miss them too,' he wrote. 'I feel remorse and guilt every day for . what happened.

Every time a new inmate is admitted, Toney said in the February 21 interview, Hadley makes an introduction. 'What's up man?' Toney quoted Hadley as saying. 'You know who I am? I'm the hammer boy.' The . inmate says Hadley has given differing accounts of why he allegedly . committed the crimes. First, he said, Hadley blamed it on medication he . was on. Later, though, he said Hadley explained it was because he wanted . to have a party and knew his parents would not let him. 'All this to have a party?' Detective Kristin Meyer of the Port St. Lucie Police asked. 'That's what he said,' Toney replied. House of horrors: This is the home where Hadley hosted a wild party while his parts lay dead in their beds . Family: Hadley's mother Mary-Jo and father Blake were found beaten to death with a hammer, which was lying between their bodies . Toney said Hadley told him he had been contemplating the killings for about three weeks and had considered using a garden tool instead. 'He said he seen the devil,' Toney said. 'He said he talked to the devil and the devil talked to him.' Still, there are glimpses of a different Hadley in the files. Toney said Hadley would sometimes bring him a ramen noodle cup, and often expressed remorse for his alleged crimes. In a log of a jailhouse visit with his older brother, Ryan, Hadley tells his brother he loves him and tells him to tell others he says hello and loves them too. Kelly Reynolds, who was interviewed by police but whose relationship to Hadley was not made clear, said he was an altar boy. Hadley's public defender, Mark Harllee, did not return a call on Friday seeking comment. Hadley told a friend interviewed by police, Daniel Roberts, that his father had punched him in the face several times and had shown signs of injuries at times, according to the files. But Toney said Hadley told him he'd never been beaten or molested, and Ryan Hadley called his parents 'awesome' and his brother a 'pathological liar'. Murder weapon: Police believe Hadley battered his parents to death with this hammer . Police have said about 60 people, invited via Facebook, gathered for a party at Hadley's house after his parents were killed, playing beer pong, smoking cigars and drinking. Friends described Hadley as being in a good mood and hospitable as the bloody bodies of his parents was strewn across the floor of their bedroom. Toney said Hadley claimed to have spent $2,000 on drugs and alcohol for the party, describing it as 'so much fun'. He said Hadley knew he had 'shocked the world' and realised something about his parents as he allegedly attacked them with a hammer. 'I said, ""Did they try to stop you?""'

But one newcomer is breaking the money mold by locking away his millions in a trust that cannot be accessed for three years. Michael Carter-Williams, a rookie NBA player for the Philadelphia 76ers, is being lauded for his financial maturity. The 22-year-old is guaranteed $4.5 million over his first seasons, but has chosen to live off his endorsement deals with Nike and Panini trading cards, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. Clever boy: With the help of his mother, 22-year-old Michael Carter Williams has put most of his $4.5 million salary in a trust for three years to preserve his wealth . Sixers rookie Michael Carter-Williams was drafted 11th overall in the 2013 NBA Draft . 'With rookie contracts capped in the NFL and NBA, the ultimate financial success of many careers are determined by the second pro contract,' said Matt Dzamba, director of sports marketing at Zambezi. 'Protecting the first contract by essentially locking it up takes a lot of pressure off the player both on and off the court.' Carter-Williams, from the Boston suburb of Hamilton, Mass., has his mother, Mandy Carter-Zegarowski and her best friend running his management team. 'Our goal is to work with Michael to manage his money in a way that will secure his long-term financial future,' Carter-Zegarowski said in a statement provided to ABC News. 'Right now, the focus is not only to save as much as possible, but also to use his unique position to serve as a role model and give back to the communities that continue to support him and his career.' 'They are taking a proactive approach to make sure he doesn't spend all his money in a couple of years,' writes Keith Pompey, staff writer for the Inquirer. Carter-Williams was drafted 11th overall in the 2013 NBA Draft. The type of trust he has chosen is not known, however financial advisers say it is a strange move, with such accounts usually set up by people with children. It's a move that should have perhaps been taken by one of the most famous 76ers, Allen Iverson. Arguably the most famous Philadelphia 76ers player, Allen Iverson, had a wealth hovering around an estimated $200 million, but was forced to admit he was broke after failing to pay child support . First drafted by the 76ers in 1996, Allen Iverson was marred by child support issues, divorce settlement entanglements, debts to jewelers and attorneys, alleged gambling and alcohol addictions, and property foreclosures . A 'Sixer' from 1996 to 2006 then 2009 to 2010, Iverson said this year that he is broke and can't pay child support. The ex-wife of the 36-year-old former Georgetown University player demanded that he put over a million dollars into a trust fund for child support. The stories of young celebrities going broke or owing money to the IRS are not new. In October, singer Aaron Carter, 25, the younger brother of Backstreet Boys member Nick, filed for bankruptcy. The travails of Lindsay Lohan, 27, and her courtroom drama often involved her need to support her family financially. 'Even if an athlete has a million dollars today, it has to last until you're 65,' said tax expert and attorney Kelly Phillips Erb. Phillips Erb said her 'gut' was that Carter-Williams and his parents created the trust to protect his money from himself. Financial ruin is hardly exclusive to athletes, with many celebrities often going broke. Sometime singer Aaron Carter filed for bankruptcy in October . A self-settled trust would have certain protections but would have to have been blessed by a court, she said. A standard irrevocable trust is typically created for estate planning purposes. These can be broken but there would be tax consequences. 'In professional sports in particular, you're going to have health problems and your knees are going to go out,' she said. 'His parents are very smart to know he has a shelf life though they hope he'll go on to good things. 'But they don't want him to blow his money on a Lamborghini.'","Philadelphia 76ers rookie Michael Carter-Williams is guaranteed $4.5 million for his first two seasons .

But a senior Russian diplomat, UN envoy Vitaly Churkin, said yesterday that the carnage in Odessa – a Ukrainian city far from the eastern areas held  by rebels – was ‘reminiscent of the crimes of the Nazis from whom the Ukrainian ultra-nationalists derive their ideological inspiration’. Ukrainian security officials accused close aides of ex-president Viktor Yanukovych, now exiled in Russia, of financing the violence in Odessa on Friday, which led to the deaths of 46 people in a burning building. Another 200 were injured in the blaze, which is believed to have been started by petrol bombs thrown by demonstrators. Former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who is standing in the presidential election, blamed Russian intelligence agencies for the unrest, and said Mr Putin was trying to destabilise her country. In Moscow, government spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Mr Putin had received ‘thousands’ of demands to intervene in Ukraine.

Kiev, European countries and Washington are talking about’. More than 60,000 Russian troops have been moved to the border with Ukraine and the newly annexed Crimea. After . street clashes in Odessa on Friday, a Ukrainian mob overran and set . fire to a camp where pro-Moscow supporters had pitched tents, forcing . them to take refuge in a trade union building which was then set ablaze.

"President Barack Obama personally authorised the phone tapping of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s mobile because he wanted to 'know everything' about the world’s most powerful woman, it was claimed on Sunday. Bild newspaper in Germany - which also reported surveilance on the phone of her predecessor Gerhard Schroeder who opposed the war in Iraq - called US denials of eavesdropping 'diplomatic lies' as new documents from the Nation security Agency in Washington suggest the bugging against the politicians began at least ten years ago, during the Bush administration. Bild quoted a secret intelligence source saying the president was informed in 2010 about the operation against Merkel by NSA boss Keith Alexander and he sanctioned it. Scroll down for video . Not amused: German Chancellor Angela Merkel had both her work and supposedly bug-proof personal mobile cracked by intelligence agents . ‘Obama did not stop the action at that time but allowed it to continue,’ said an intelligence official familiar with the NSA operation against Merkel image on Sunday. 'Obama did not stop the action but rather furthered it,' said the Bild informant. 'The reason for the action?' said Bild. 'Obama wanted to know exactly who this woman was.' German handling of the eurozone crisis and its refusal to get involved militarily in Libya increased White House suspicions of who it was dealing with in Europe, it added. It was also claimed that as well as listening into the Nokia supplied to her by her CDU conservative party the electronic wizards of the NSA also cracked her secure personal mobile only last summer - receiving both text messages and overhearing calls from that device too - even though it was supposed to have been made bug-proof by German intelligence boffins. German media said there was little doubt that ‘Handygate’ - the name given to the scandal from the German word Handy for mobile phone - was launched from the American embassy at Pariser Platz in the heart of the capital Berlin. According to German newspapers, 18 NSA specialists are currently stationed in Berlin, working from a soundproofed, bombproof room on the fourth floor of the ultra-modern, ultra secure embassy that is less than two miles from the chancellor’s office. According to media reports it was Tony Blair’s mentor in the war against Iraq, President George W. Bush, who instigated the surveillance against the socialist premier Gerhard Schroeder. 'Where do the Germans stand, can we trust Schroeder?' was allegedly the question, according to Bild, posted in the White House when Bush sanctioned the hacking of his phone. Sanctioned: Bild quotes a secret intelligence source which claims the President not only sanctioned but extended the operation against Mrs Merkel . He apparently was particularly disturbed about the closeness of the relationship that Schroeder had with Vladimir Putin of Russia - a friendship which led to Schroeder gaining a five million pound a year job with Russian energy giant Gazprom when he left office. 'Schroeder knew that he had greatly angered America with his opposition to the Iraq war,' said Bild. 'In his inner circle he made no secret of his conviction that he was being bugged by the American secret services.' German politicians together with spy chiefs are scheduled to fly to the USA this week for talks with their counterparts about the snooping programme. 'High-ranking government representatives will go rapidly to the United States in order to push forward discussions with the White House and the NSA on the allegations raised recently,” said Georg Streiter, the chancellor’s deputy spokesman. The row has prompted European leaders to demand a new deal with Washington on intelligence gathering that would maintain an essential alliance while keeping the fight against terrorism on track. The 28 leaders also warn that while the bloc and the United States share a 'close relationship', it must 'be based on respect and trust.'","Bild newspaper in Germany called US denials of eavesdropping 'diplomatic lies' as new documents emerge .

"There can be little mistake who we’re talking about. ‘When he played in my team he was always on the brink of clashing with  players,’ says Ricardo Perdomo, the youth team coach at Nacional, Uruguay’s leading club. ‘That’s just the intensity with which he plays. He didn’t care about anything other than scoring and winning. Many times I had to calm him down.’ Alejandro Garay, another coach at Nacional, agrees. ‘I hope these words aren’t misunderstood but he has always been something of a rough diamond when playing football,’ he says. ‘The word we use is “bandit”. He would try anything to win a match, taking the rules to the limit and even beyond.’ Star in the making: Former junior team-mates of Luis Suarez say he has always been committed on the pitch . Star pupil: Suarez poses with a teacher and some of his paintings . It could only be Luis Suarez, the man who, assuming he recovers from knee surgery, is most likely to be England’s nemesis when Roy Hodgson’s team take on Uruguay in Sao Paulo on June 19. For while Suarez has established his reputation in England as one of the world’s best footballers, he is also the man who bit Branislav Ivanovic — the second such incident in his career — and the man who was found guilty of racially abusing Patrice Evra. And then there is the diving and arguing with referees, though in comparison to his worst misdemeanours, those seem relatively minor. The talent, the temper and tantrums: they all seem inseparable cords of the personality that makes up Suarez. And all were evident early on. Though, incredibly, for a player now ranked by some only behind Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo as the world’s greatest, at the age of 15 he was in danger of being dropped by Nacional. ‘There was no certainty he would be a professional player,’ said Perdomo. ‘When he was younger, he didn’t play too much. His team-mates, like Bruno Fornaroli and Martin Cauteruccio, kept him out of the first team and at the time I couldn’t see him becoming what he is now.’ Making his point: The striker scored 31 times for Liverpool as they finished second in the Premier League . Prize guy: Suarez was the PFA Player of the Year . Suarez moved to Montevideo from Salto aged seven, although the transition to the capital was troubled, according to those close to him, because of the split between his parents, Rodolfo and Sandra, when he was nine years old. ‘He was a kid,’ said Perdomo. ‘Naturally he was carrying some family problems due to his parents’ split. Sometimes he would miss training. That’s why in his beginning he didn’t take football that seriously.’ The scout who had taken him to Nacional, Wilson Pirez, remembers that pivotal period of Suarez’s life. ‘There was a time I said to him, “If you don’t take football seriously I can release you from Nacional just as easily as I brought you here”. It bothered me that he was not playing, so I persuaded him to try harder to be part of the regular youth teams. ‘He understood that and [from then on] he has never stopped trying. He is a kind of monster, with a huge heart, in the way he plays. After so many years in football, I have seen loads of players with better skills but without his hunger for success and glory.’ Perhaps Suarez owes a little of his  success to Pirez’s daughter, who, however innocently, would provide updates on his social life. ‘He would go to the same parties as my daughter and she would say, “I saw Luisito last night”. ‘I would say, “Oh, did you?” because “Luisito” had to play the next day. It was not the best thing for him to do, but the day after he was there, ready to score more goals, with the same intensity as usual. Only when they get to 16 or 17 years old do players realise they have to focus on their careers and they start to stay at home more. One of my jobs was convincing him to follow the right path to be a professional.’ Darker days: Suarez was slapped with a 10-game ban for biting Branislav Ivanovic last year . Illegal intervention: Suarez infamously handballed on the line during the quarter-final victory over Ghana at the 2010 World Cup . Sharpshooter: Suarez has scored 38 times for his country . Once the work ethic had been installed, curbing his aggression was the next task. In a highly disputed incident, when he was 16, he was alleged to have head-butted a referee after being sent off in a crucial match for the Nacional Under-17 team in a title decider against Danubio. What is established is that Suarez was outraged by the red card, approached the referee Luis Larrañaga, and that something unsavoury took place. But no contemporary report now exists and no one who was there appears willing to discuss it in full. Perdomo said: ‘The incident was not as big as people have made out. There was a discussion among the players, the referee was involved in the scene and received some aggression from Luis — but unintentionally. I don’t know whether it was a punch or a spit but it wasn’t that important.’ Fornaroli said: ‘I was next to him when he had that incident with the referee. It is as if he lives the matches too much, his entire life goes on the pitch and he knows when he is wrong. That time we were in the dressing room and he knew he had gone too far.’ Pirez added: ‘He received a ban and that was it. He’s never been a violent player.’ Almost all agree that meeting Sofia Balbi, who is now his wife, at the age of 15 was the catalyst for Suarez’s talent to be fulfilled. ‘For footballers, getting married too early is a common mistake,’ said Perdomo. ‘But Luis’s case was very special. When he was in my team I remember seeing Sofia watching matches. I’m very happy they are still together.’ Suarez credits Sofia with helping him to fulfil his potential. ‘I wasn’t on the path I wanted to be on,’ he said. ‘I was going out at night, I didn’t enjoy studying and I wasn’t dedicating myself to football. When I was a kid, there were some people around me who were a bad influence. Support: Suarez credits his wife Sofia with keeping him on the path to success . Concern: Suarez underwent knee surgery last month and is a doubt for their opener against Costa Rica . Luis Suarez's career has been plagued by disciplinary issues. In July 2010 he was sent off for a last-gasp goalline hand-ball which stopped Ghana from scoring the winner in a World Cup quarter-final. Asamoah Gyan missed Ghana’s penalty and Uruguay won the shootout. In November that year, playing for Ajax, he was given a seven-match ban for biting PSV Eindhoven’s Otman Bakkal. Having joined Liverpool he was banned for eight matches and fined £40,000 for racially abusing Manchester United defender Patrice Evra in October 2011. He refused to shake Evra’s hand when the teams next met and in April last year was banned for 10 games for biting the arm of Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic. ‘When I met my Sofia, I think it all changed. She was very important for me because she steered me back on to the path I wanted to be on. ‘When I was single I would go out at night, but then when I had a girlfriend I would always go to her house, so I had more peace of mind. She would also tell me to study and to focus on my ability to play football, and to forget about everything else. ‘I’m the one out on the pitch, but I think if she hadn’t helped me change my life, I probably wouldn’t have made it. Also, I wasn’t playing at Nacional, I was on the bench, some people told me to look for another club, but there were two people who told me to stay and helped me to get another chance.’ Now the whole of Uruguay waits, expecting him to be fit, if not for their first match of the World Cup against Costa Rica, then certainly to face his adopted country England. ‘He is definitely on the way to being one of the most important players in Uruguay history and there’s still more to come,’ said Perdomo. ‘With Suarez, Edinson Cavani and Diego Godin, Uruguay have as a good a team as I can ever remember.’ Pirez is especially confident. ‘Defenders in England don’t know how to mark him as he is so unpredictable,’ he said. ‘He watches the game and always changes his tactics depending on the defender he has to face. It will be difficult for Uruguay to have a striker of his magnitude ever again.’ For all his troubles and the initial lack of application to the game, the early influences on Suarez’s life are proud of what he has achieved. ‘It has been very emotional watching him develop,’ said Perdomo. England can but hope he can be contained, just for a day.","LIverpool striker is struggling with knee injury ahead of opener against Costa Rica on June 14 .

"Imagine the ideal designer dog. It would be smart, healthy and hypoallergenic. It would have the yap bred out and longevity bred in. And, most important, it would never lose its puppy face. Enter the 'cava-poo-chon.' The breed is the newest and latest in the decades-old search for the dog-face fountain of youth and perfect pet accessory. But the American Kennel Club does not recognize the new trend as an official breed, and one expert calls some specially bred small dogs expensive 'gimmicks.' Scroll down for video . I will look young fur-ever: This lucky pup will never look old... but has been dismissed as a 'gimmick' by the American Kennel Club . The perfect dog? The cava-poo chon - a 'tribrid' mix of a cavalier King Charles spaniel and bichon frise mix bred with a miniature poodle - is smart, healthy, hypoallergenic and never loses its puppy face . Puppy face: The breed is the newest and latest in the decades-old search for the dog-face fountain of youth . 'There's always been a market for these . forever-ish young dogs,' said veteran trainer Steve Haynes of Fidelio . Dog Works in Austin who is working with 50 first-generation . cava-poo-chons. 'Until recently, specialized dogs like miniature Yorkies . and miniature Maltese were the go-to dogs.' The cava-poo-chon is a cavalier King Charles spaniel and bichon frise mix bred with a miniature poodle. With the help of a geneticist and reproductive veterinarian, the tribrid or 'triple cross' was created by Linda and Steve Rogers of Timshell Farm in Pine, Arizona. With a price tag ranging from $2,000 to $3,500, the cava-poo-chon combines the best of the three breeds, Linda Rogers said. She added that there is no reason they can't live for 20 years. The Rogers' offer a choice of color and two types of coat - curly or very curly, she said. Expert guidance: With the help of a geneticist and reproductive veterinarian, the tribrid or 'triple cross' was created by Linda and Steve Rogers of Timshell Farm in Pine, Ariz . So far, 58 families have returned to . get a second cava-poo-chon, and 12 of the dogs have been certified to . work in nursing homes and hospitals as therapy dogs, Rogers said. Amy Wolf of Austin says she found her perfect dog in the breed. 'There's always been a market for these . forever-ish young dogs' 'I can't tell you the number of times a day I look at her and say, ""You are so cute"".' Not only that, her three-year-old named Callie has become the love of her husband's life - despite his allergies - and enchanted all their new neighbors. She hired Haynes as a trainer. 'Never have we had a more loving, sweet dog. She wants to say hello to everyone,' said Wolf, who moved into a new home with her husband two months before getting Callie. 'We've met tons of people while walking her. We feel much more connected with this neighborhood than the previous one, all because of her. She makes us more approachable, and we feel a lot safer.' Puppy love: Brande Bradshaw of Austin thinks Bridgette, her six-month-old cava-poo (there is no bichon in her), is the perfect dog . The popularity of the baby look for . dogs started more than a half-century ago with mail-order teacup pups . advertised in the backs of magazines. Fan: Veteran trainer Steve Haynes is working with 50 first-generation cava-poo-chons . Yorkies, Maltese and Pomeranians . were popular for a while, and recently there have been hybrid hounds . 'with cutesy names that end in '-oodle,' '-uddle' or '-poo' that come . with thousand-dollar price tags,' said author and certified animal . behavior consultant Darlene Arden of Massachusetts. Arden said she was unfamiliar with the cava-poo-chon, though she applauded the use of a geneticist. But she condemned 'gimmicks' that some breeders and groomers use to attract unwitting buyers. 'There . is no such thing as a teacup anything,' Arden said. 'It is a market . term used by backyard breeders and commercial breeders so they can breed . the smallest dogs that shouldn't be bred and sell them for a whole lot . of money. These dogs usually end up having health problems and most . veterinarians don't want to touch them because the organs are so small.' The American Kennel Club does not recognize the cava-poo-chon. 'AKC does not recognize cross-bred or mixed breed dogs as official breeds,' spokeswoman Lisa Peterson said. 'These dogs are the product of two purebred parents of different breeds, resulting in a litter of mixed breed puppies, not a new breed, according to our requirements.' But Brande Bradshaw of Austin thinks Bridgette, her six-month-old cava-poo (there is no bichon in her), is the perfect dog. Hybrid trend: This petite golden doodle dog is another designer breed that has become popular as part of the vogue for puppy-faced dogs . 'I have been blown away,' said Bradshaw, who also hired Haynes as a trainer. 'She is amazing, the cutest puppy I've ever seen.' Bradshaw flies frequently for her job as a technology saleswoman, and she leaves Bridgette at day care, where the ten-pounder is a favorite. 'Every time I log in, she is running around having a blast,' Bradshaw said. She sometimes feels like Bridgette has forgotten about her until pick-up time, when Bridgette spots Bradshaw and 'runs full-speed ahead, her tail going a million miles a minute, right into my arms.'","The cava-poo-chon is a cavalier King Charles spaniel and bichon frise mix bred with a miniature poodle .

'So . we paused to collect ourselves and assure that everything was going to . be right, and then as we continued to lower it down, it pitched, and . that's when it went over.' The company that built the boat will be responsible for the cost of the salvage operation. The buyer of the boat told KIRO-TV that they are 'absolutely heartbroken' by the boat's capsize.

"One of Britain's worst boxers who is so bad he describes himself as a 'human punchbag' is getting back in the ring despite losing his last 50 fights in a row. Robin Deakin, 27, won his first professional bout in 2006 but has lost every bout since then and currently has the worst professional record in the country. He has been knocked out 12 times in his last 50 fights and has performed so badly that he even had his British boxing licence taken away.

Defeated: Robin gets checked over by a doctor after being defeated by Ryan Taylor in January 2012 . But rather than give up, Robin got a permit issued in Germany so he can carry on fighting. Despite his half a century of losses, he is preparing for his next clash against an as yet unnamed fighter in London on March 1. Robin, of East Tilbury, Essex, said: 'I've been a human punch bag. I'd love a title. I'll probably never get one, but I feel like I deserve it. 'My record doesn't reflect my abilities really. There have been several times where I think I should have won on points, or got a knockout, and the decision has gone the other way. 'I think people expect me to lose now - but you can bet that I try my best to win every single time I step in the ring. Despite my record boxing is all I know, all I live for.'

But since then he has one of the worst boxing records of all time . turning pro records office BoxRec say he has one of the worst boxing records of all time. He said: 'When fights have been set up for me, they haven't always had my best interests at heart - I've been paying people's mortgages and it's cost me my licence. 'You look at boxers like Amir Khan and they have one big fight a year, at one point I had 19 fights in 24 weeks.

'I would get a call saying someone has dropped out and can I take their place. One fight I had seven hours' notice, and most of that was spent on a train to Birmingham.' Born with a club foot, Robin endured 60 operations and could not walk until he was six. He said: 'I've been boxing for 21 years. I took it up to build my own confidence, make my legs stronger and make people proud of me. I think I'm still doing that. 'I hope my comeback will make the British boxing authority give me back my licence so I can carry on living my dream.'

Victory: George Michael Carman holds his arms aloft after defeating Deakin on points in December 2011 . The UK's boxing regulatory authority, the British Boxing Board of Control, suspended Deakin's licence in 2012 when they began worrying for his health after sustaining so many blows to the head. BBBC General Secretary Robert Smith said: 'What needs to be stated here is that he has no British Boxing Board of Control licence. 'He had his licence withdrawn for his own interests. Robin's forthcoming fight is nothing to do with the BBBC. 'If he wishes to reapply for his licence, that will be considered, but he had his licence taken away for his best interests. 'The sad thing here is that Robin is a very nice young man. Everybody likes him, and he's mad on boxing. We felt for his own welfare he should be stopped. 'We have a duty of care to individuals and we would never knowingly sanction a fight with somebody incapable of boxing.' Mr Smith added: 'The record looks worse than it is. He always put up a good show. He always did his very very best. 'He has had his time, and we wish him the best in any future endeavours.'

"Amanda Knox is due to find out today whether she faces a retrial for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher. Italian supreme court judges are expected to decide if ‘Foxy Knoxy’ and her ex-boyfriend Raffaele  Sollecito should be retried – or whether their acquittal in 2011 should be confirmed. Meredith, 21, from Coulsdon, Surrey, was found semi-naked with her throat cut in the bedroom of the house she shared with Knox and two other women in the hilltop town of Perugia in November 2007. Final hurtle: Amanda Knox, seen here in 2009, faces one last judgement day tomorrow when the Italian Supreme Court considers whether the appeal that freed her should be upheld . Demanding answers: Stephanie Kercher, left, said the Italian Supreme Court must answer questions about the 2007 murder of her sister Meredith, right . Yesterday Meredith’s sister Stephanie . said: ‘There are lots of questions without answers and that’s why we . are looking for the truth. ‘We miss Meredith terribly and nothing will bring her back. ‘We hope that the supreme court hearing will help to find some answers to what happened that night. ‘We still get messages of support from all over the world.  Meredith will never be forgotten but it’s also important not to forget . what happened, a beautiful young girl, my little sister, taken away from . us too early in a brutal manner, with many aspects to still clarify.’ Knox, 25, and Sollecito, 29 tomorrow, . are said to be anxiously awaiting the outcome of the hearing in Rome. The case will be decided purely on paperwork and legal documents with no . new witness evidence and neither Knox nor Sollecito will be in court. Since returning to Seattle after . serving four years of her sentence, Knox has written a book about her . imprisonment and is due to give an interview to American TV station ABC . next month ahead of its release. Judgement day: Knox, 25, and her former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito were acquitted and freed in 2011, though they could face trial again if the Supreme Court rules there is enough evidence . Judges will rule whether their are . grounds for a new trial or if the case against them should uphold the . appeal verdict of October 2011 which cleared them of the murder after . they had initially been found guilty in 2009, with Knox getting 26 years . and Sollecito, 25 years in jail. The . case made headlines around the world amid tales of sex games and drugs . and there were traumatic scenes when they were convicted initially and . when they were cleared after a fresh hearing heard how the police . investigation had been bungled and was riddled with flaws. Defence . lawyers and experts acting for the pair revealed how evidence had been . contaminated or poorly handled by forensic teams and that the conviction . should be considered unsafe. They were immediately freed with Knox returning to her home in Seattle while Sollecito went back to Bisceglie on the southern Italian coast near Bari. Under Italian law there are three tiers of the judicial system and Monday's hearing in Rome will be behind closed doors with neither of them in attendance, with only their lawyers representing them. A panel of judges will rule whether the Italian legal code was applied correctly and fairly in both trials and if they find grounds they can order a retrial - as prosecutors in Perugia have demanded - or they can close the case completely. Images of Knox and Sollecito embracing after Kercher was murdered made the trial even more sensational . The case will be decided purely on . paperwork and legal documents with no new witnesses giving evidence and . neither of them will be in court. Luciano . Ghirga, Knox's lawyer, said: 'She is very anxious about the hearing but . she is waiting for it knowing full well that the outcome is very . important.' Sollecito has also written a book and has already given an interview on Italian TV about the case where he said he and Knox were no longer lovers but they were still in touch. He visited her earlier this year and they speak on Skype regularly. He is now studying in Verona and they have always insisted they are innocent of Leeds University student Meredith's murder. She had only been in Italy for two months before she was killed having arrived from Coulsdon for a year long course as part of her degree. His father Francesco said: 'He is working hard on his studies. He's working on a project involving the movement of surgical instruments during operations. He is calm and serene even if we are all in a state of apprehension.' During the investigation and trial, much was made of Knox's character, with prosecutors saying she was highly sexual and had manipulated Sollecito but her lawyers dismissed the theory. Drifter Rudy Guede is serving 16 years for the murder having initially being sentenced to 30 but this was later reduced on appeal.","Knox and Raffaele Sollecito will find out if they are to stand trial again .

"The fiancee of a man whose first wife died of ovarian cancer has spoken of how a letter the dying woman left her 'touched her heart in so many ways'. Mother-of-four Brenda Schmitz had written two letters one month before she died in August 2011 - one to her husband David Schmitz and the other to whoever his new partner would be - and asked a friend to send it to KSTZ radio station in Des Moines, Iowa, when her husband found someone new. Jayne Abraham, herself a mother-of-two, said the letter had given her strength against 'any doubt I might have had' about her new relationship. Scroll down for video . Tearful: David Schmitz and Jayne Abraham described how much the letters meant to them . Beyond the grave: Brenda Schmitz, who wrote a letter to be read out on KSTZ radio . New beginnings: David Schmitz and his new fiancee Jayne Abraham, who both received beyond-the-grave letters from Mr Schmitz's former wife Brenda . She said: 'There were times when maybe it was . questionable and I struggled personally a little bit because I wasn't . sure that it was really the right time. 'David always assured me, ""I'm . ready for this"". He told me that she had left a . letter for me also and at that point I was all tears. 'He said, well, . you can read it when we get home tonight. I read the letter and it . touched my heart in so many different ways.It filled . the package for me with any doubt that I might have had.' Ms . Abraham said the letter had been lighthearted and that Mrs Schmitz had . made jokes in it, ending with 'how much she loves us through my letter . and she loves me... [and saying] you need to give them all the love that . all children need'. For more than 20 years, KSTZ radio . station in Des Moines has been granting Christmas wishes for . listeners - including Mrs Schmitz's request. Right time: Brenda Schmitz, centre, wanted to give her blessings to her husband's future fiancee . In the letter, Brenda asks the . station to fulfill her last wish to do something for the new woman in . her husband's life, for her family and for the doctors and nurses who . helped ease her pain. It has become an online hit - something that Ms Abraham described as 'extremely amazing and untouchable'. She said: 'We didn't expect the publicity, we didn't . expect it to go where it has gone, and I think we're both extremely . touched by the love and the support and the comments and the prayers and . everything that everyone has sent forth to us. 'Our hearts are just throbbing and so filled right now.' Mr Schmitz proposed to Ms Abraham in the summer. She said: 'When I first met David, I knew he said he . had a little guy, Max, and he was two when we met, and he had older . boys. 'At first I really didn't think anything of it. I have two children . of my own and I love kids. 'Every day we've gotten stronger and we've . developed a stronger bond and relationship.' Mr Schmitz said he first heard the letter when the station read it to him the day before it went out on air at 7.10am on Friday, read by the programme host Colleen Kelly. He said: 'They said they had received a letter that someone wanted to grant me a wish. I asked who is it from and . they said it's so personal that we can't tell you over the phone. You . need to come in here. 'They started by saying it was dated August 3 2011. They said you . recently lost your wife Brenda to ovarian cancer. They read it and I was in shock - it was unfathomable. 'The whole process of what I heard, the wishes - it was very tough. My . mind was going every which way and couldn't' fathom that the letter . exists and the letter that she wrote to Jane also. It was quite . incredible.' Pampering: Brenda's first wish was that Jayne (right) be treated to a spa day, saying she deserves it with taking on the responsibility of all Brenda's sons - including youngest Max (left) Christmas wish: Brenda's second wish was that her family get a vacation where they can make memories to last a lifetime. She also asked that the nurses and doctors who treated her get a dinner for helping her through her pain . Mrs Schmitz had written: 'When you are in . receipt of this letter, I will have already lost my battle to ovarian . cancer. 'I told [my friend] once my loving husband David . had moved on in his life and had met someone to share his life with . again, to mail this letter to all of you at the station. Her first wish was directed at her husband's fiance, asking that she be treated to a spa day. 'She . deserves it,' Mrs Schmitz wrote. 'Being a step-mother to all those boys, and . especially giving little Max a mother's love that only she can give. Make her smile and know her efforts are truly appreciated from me.' 'Thank you. I love you, whoever you are,' she added. The second wish was that her family be taken on a magical trip, somewhere they could all enjoy and make memories to last a lifetime. Her final wish was for the nurses and doctors who took care of her in the cancer unit at Mercy Medical Center. 'A night out full of drinks, food and fun for all they do every day for the cancer patients they encounter,' she wrote. Her husband fought back tears while listening to the letter, and said he wasn't surprised that his wife would have organised such an elaborate gift. 'It's not surprising, because the last year and a half she's shown so many signs that she's there,' he said, adding that he saw a double rainbow the morning after she died and that 'Somewhere over the Rainbow' was her favourite song. Touched: Mr Schmitz fought back tears during the radio segment, saying he wasn't suprised his wife had organised something like this . 'There was no question that we were going to do something for this wish,' station manager Scott Allen told the Des Moines Register. 'It was what could we do that would be deserving of Brenda's name and memory.' With the help of sponsors, the station was able to grant all three of Mrs Schmitz's wishes. The family of eight will be treated to a vacation at Walt Disney World in Florida where Ms Abraham will relax with a spa day. As for the nurses and doctors at Mercy Medical Center, they'll get get three coordinated food drops provided by a local catering company.

"Usually a portrait of a little girl might involve a cute dress and a hair bow, but these parents have gone for a quirkier look for the mantlepiece. Their children are dressed as Mother Teresa, . Freda Kahlo and astronaut Ellen Ochoa. They  form part of a photography project . with a worthy mission -- to encourage the next generation of women to . value more than just their looks by posing as women . who have changed history . The initiative, known as the Isis . Project, is the brainchild of photographer Kat Carey and marketing . manager Cassandra Yerdeni from San Antonio in Texas. Pretty in pink: Jackie O and her tiny fan . ‘We want to empower girls to emulate women who’ve made a contribution to society,’ explains 27-year-old co-founder Cassandra, mother to two-year-old Lily. The iconic women picked for the project include Michelle Obama, Freda Khalo, Mother Teresa, Maya Angelou, and Queen Elizabeth. ‘Girls . deserve to feel good about themselves and know that showing some skin . or being “pretty” is not that the only way to be rewarded,’ says Kat, . who is the project’s photographer. ‘There . is nothing wrong with owning your own sexuality or being good-looking, . but women should be praised for more than that,' she tells MailOnline. Mini me: A little girl poses as Mother Teresa for The Isis Project . Frida Kahlo is amongst the most popular female icons requested . ‘We should be praised for our talent, minds, skills, heart and strengths. ‘We want this project to be a form of education -- opening up new role models and great women to look up to,' she adds. The pair hold monthly sessions in their studio in San Antonio and named the series of images the Isis Project, after the Egyptian goddess of rebirth, a symbol of strong femininity. As a single parent, Cassandra says she strives to surround her two-year-old daughter Lily with courageous and passionate role models, and to instill in her a feeling of pride in her femininity. Reach for the stars: A tot dresses up as former astronaut Ellen Ochoa . ‘Through the Isis Project, I hope to recognise the achievements of women throughout history, in a variety of fields, and to inspire girls just like Lily to fly with their own wings,’ she says. Kat, who lives with her husband, Mike, and daughter Sofia, two (pictured here styled as Annie Leibovitz) is equally passionate. ‘We want to achieve so much,’ says the 29-year-old, ‘But at the same time we would honestly happy to achieve as little as empowering one girl to know that her worth is not measured but her looks.’ When I grow up I want to be Queen: A little girl dreams big dressed as Queen Elizabeth I . So how did the creative duo come up with the idea? ‘We were inspired by Austin-based photographer, Jaime Moore’s “Not Just A Girl”, which is collection of five photos of her pre-school aged daughter dressed as real-life female heroines,’ Kat recalls. ‘We both saw it and thought, “We should do this with our daughters.” Then Cassandra said, “We should do this with the entire city!”’ The Isis Project, invites all girls, from babies to 18-year-olds, to participate and pose as a trailblazer. Seeing double: Posing as fashion trailblazer Coco Chanel . The parents and girls decide which heroine they’d like to copy, and so far Frida Kahlo and Michelle Obama have proven the most popular role models.

"A teenage girl who murdered her 'best friend' along with a female classmate kept up a disturbingly normal social media presence in the months before she confessed to the brutal killing. Rachel Shoaf, along with her friend . Sheila Eddy, lured 16-year-old Skylar Neese out of her house in July . 2012, before stabbing her to death and hiding her body in a Pennsylvania . wood. It was six months before Shoaf and Eddy confessed to the killings - and remained active on social media through the frantic search for their friend. On July 7, 2012, just a day after she and Shoaf killed Miss Neese, Eddy tweeted a 'happy birthday' message to a friend. Tribute: Sheila Eddy posted this tribute to Skylar Neese (on the left in each photo) on Twitter in March 2013 before being arrested for her murder . Eddy posted this message months after she and friend Rachel Shoaf murdered 16-year-old Skylar Neese . Eddy kept up a steady stream of tweets about watching Law And Order on TV, doing homework and going to parties, according to a new episode of ABC's 20/20 to be aired on Friday. She also tweeted about how close her friendship was with Shoaf, writing: 'no one on this earth can handle me and rachel is you think you can you're wrong.' Shoaf finally cracked on January 3, 2013 and confessed to investigators what had happened and where . to find their friend's body. Eddy and Shoaf . lured Skylar out of her ground-floor bedroom in Star City and drove her . to a secluded spot near the unincorporated West Virginia community of . Macdale. The girls then stabbed her to death at an agreed-upon moment. Authorities . said the girls covered the body of the University High honors student . with branches when they couldn't bury her, and left it in a wooded area . across the Pennsylvania border for months. Eddy tweeted this message shortly before her arrest for the murder of Skylar Neese. Fellow murderer Rachel Shoaf had already admitted to police that the girl's decided to count to three and then stab the 16-year-old . Eddy posted a stream of inane messages to her Twitter account in the months after she fatally stabbed her 'best friend' Skylar Neese . Eddy posted happy birthday greetings to a friend the day after she and Shoaf murdered Skylar Neese and left her body in the woods . Days after Rachel Shoaf admitted to killing her friend Skylar Neese along with Eddy, the latter was back on Twitter posting messages about TV . However a few days later, Eddy was back on Twitter, posting messages about watching her favorite TV shows. In March, authorities announced that the remains found belonged to Skylar Neese. Even then, Eddy was still keeping up the act. She posted a picture montage of the girls together with the message: 'Rest easy Skylar, you’ll ALWAYS be my best friend.' She then tweeted that it was the 'worst day of my whole life'. Shoaf and Eddy plotted Neese's murder at school, Shoaf admitted during her confession in January 2013. They planned to pick up Neese at her home then stab her to death in the woods, after counting to three. On March 30, 2013, before she was arrested for murder, Eddy tweeted: 'We really did go on three.' Eddy pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and was sentenced in January to life as part of a plea agreement that makes her eligible for parole after 15 years. Shoaf, 17, pleaded guilty last May to second-degree murder in the July 2012 slaying. She'll be eligible for parole after 10 years. Rachel Shoaf pleaded guilty to murdering her friend Skylar Neese in July 2012 for no apparent reason other than she didn't want to be friends with her anymore. She was sentenced to 30 years in March (pictured) Sheila Eddy, pictured in court in October, was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of her friend in March this year . At her sentencing, Shoaf asked the court for forgiveness just before she was handed 30 years in state prison. She also made a chilling admission that they'd done it 'because they didn't want to be friends with Skylar anymore'. Eddy refused to address the court . other than to say guilty. The victim's father, Dave Neese, later said he . found her silence 'unacceptable'. Her lawyer said it wasn't a signal of any lack of remorse. Speaking . at Eddy's sentencing, Skylar's family revealed how their daughter's . friend had comforted them and joined in their grief to try and cover her . tracks. Skylar's aunt . Carol Michaud said: 'She came and acted as if she knew nothing. She . pretended and stayed with us and comforted us and swore she had no idea . what was going.To come to this day and admit she did just shows how evil . she can be.'","Rachel Shoaf, 17, of Morgantown, West Virginia and her friend, Sheila Eddy, lured 16-year-old Skylar Neese from home, stabbed her to death and dumped her body in the Pennsylvania woods .

"The shimmering lead-cut crystal teardrops of a large chandelier that hangs precariously from the rotting ceiling joists offers a hint of the house’s former grandeur. As do the expensive swag curtains hanging incongruously as a backdrop to a rubble-strewn floor. This is The Georgians, a home once owned by the Saudi royal family. Its cracked walls are covered in moss patches, weeds grow through the plaster, pigeon and rat droppings litter the rotting carpets and the swimming pool is  covered in green slime. Yet this husk of a home is worth about £30 million, even in its ruined state. The reason? It sits on tree-lined The Bishops Avenue in North-West London — as famous for its Billionaires’ Row nickname as for its tasteless architecture — which was proclaimed last month the second most expensive road in Britain. Scroll down for video . Sad fate: The Saudi royal family once owned The Georgians on The Bishops Avenue - better known as 'Billionaires' Row' Left to rot: A lead crystal chandelier and swagged curtains are all that¿s left of The Georgians finery . Former grandeur: Walls have been left to crack with weeds growing through the plaster . Just a couple of mansions away, on the same street, is The Towers, another gigantic mock-Georgian edifice in ruins. Paint flakes off the walls, the ceilings have disintegrated and weeds sprout on the vast double staircase. A few hundred yards down the  avenue is another palatial home, Redcroft, also empty. Mould and algae cover the tiles of its pool, damp seeps through its ceilings and discarded mattresses and furniture litter its rooms. Two more homes nearby — Dryades and Ilkley House — have also met the same sorry fate. This prestige address reflects an extraordinary and disturbing new trend in the property boom in which multi-millionaire overseas home-owners leave houses empty and untended for years on end, until they become derelict. There are some 15 unoccupied and dilapidated mansions on The Bishops Avenue, worth as much as £350 million. The super-rich who own them are confident that even if they leave the properties to rot they will still get a tremendous return on their investment when they sell up, because of increasing land values. Since they have houses all over the world, these wealthy men need not set foot in these ruins. And because they can afford to leave them empty, they benefit from tax concessions most of us who actually live in our homes can only dream of. Renovation costs on houses left empty for more than two years are eligible for a reduced VAT rate of just five per cent compared to the normal 20 per cent. In addition, if these gargantuan, wrecked properties are demolished, and a new home constructed on the site, building costs are not subject to VAT. Valuable: Decaying properties like The Towers will still recoup a huge profit . Tread carefully:  Ferns and weeds now climb its dilapidated staircase . By stoking demand for such multi-million-pound properties, these potentates are pouring fuel on an already roaring housing market — which means the prospect of home-ownership further down the chain is spiralling far beyond the reach of countless families and young couples. Why has The Bishops Avenue become a road full of deserted mansions? And why are more and more wealthy foreigners using London’s property market as an investment? The Bishops Avenue used to be owned by the Church of England in the 19th century, and its homes were on vast, leafy and attractive plots of land a short walk from Hampstead Heath and within easy reach of the City of London. Soon industrialists such as William Park Lyle, of Tate & Lyle sugar fame and George Sainsbury, the son of the supermarket founder, as well as cinema and musical hall stars such as Gracie Fields moved in. By the 1940s the street became the butt of comedians’ jokes because of the increasingly ostentatious homes springing up and the influx of  nouveau riche inhabitants such as  holiday camp king Billy Butlin. In the Sixties, the rich were building what a London Borough of Barnet council official noted as ‘often unscholarly and dull or aggressively modern and incongruous’ homes. With worldwide political and economic unrest in the Seventies, oil and shipping magnates from across the world began buying up properties on the street which was by now earning a reputation as being the British equivalent of Beverly Hills in LA. Over the decades affluent businessmen from Greece, the Middle East and Africa all bought on the Avenue. The Sultan of Brunei acquired  several properties. More recently, Russian oligarchs have moved in. Former glory: The Towers' imposing staircase is green with mould . Haunt of the super-rich: These days, the only visitors to The Towers are security guards . Meanwhile, the owners started to compete with their neighbours to build the most opulent mansions.Halis Toprak, a Turkish industrialist, bought a huge 30,000 sq ft home there, named it Toprak Mansion and installed a bath big enough for 20 people. Inevitably, locals nicknamed it ‘Top Whack Mansion’. As the Avenue’s international reputation grew, land values soared. Lakshmi Mittal, the Indian steel magnate and once Britain’s richest man, bought the Summer Palace in 1996 for £6.75 million and sold it in 2011 for £38 million — a profit of £2 million for every year. Dryades was bought in about 2005 for £12 million by a Pakistani former minister. The property was seized in 2011 by Deutsche Bank after a lengthy High Court battle, and put on the market for £30 million. Heath Lodge, where fashion tycoon Aristos Constantinou was shot dead in 1984, was bought for just £400,000 in the Seventies and is today estimated to be worth £14 million. Ten of the homes now standing vacant were owned by Saudi princes. They invested in the British property market because they feared Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was about to invade their homeland and seize their vast wealth. These mansions were sold last year and are to be redeveloped — ‘when’ is open to question. Many of the houses are purchased by offshore companies, and Land Registry documents show a paper trail leading to Panama, the Bahamas and the Channel Islands. This desire for anonymity has robbed The Bishops Avenue of any sense of community spirit, however. Many owners have spent a small fortune screening their property from the road, and some years ago, a council report lamented how many of the homes were becoming ‘intimidating’ fortresses to keep prying eyes out. Around a third of the houses on the exclusive row are currently standing empty . Given the continuing demand for homes on the street, owners are understandably confident that even if they leave the properties empty to rot they will still get a tremendous return on their investment. There is one snag, however. Wildlife enthusiasts claim that the numerous nooks and crannies in these derelict properties are now inhabited by bats and owls. And since all species of bat and their roosts are protected by law, developers could be prevented from knocking down the dilapidated houses, as well as making extensive refurbishments. Civitas, the free-market think tank, has proposed a ban on foreign buyers outside the EU buying homes, claiming that in 2012, at least 85 per cent of prime property was paid for with money from overseas. But London is still seen as a safe investment, with no sign of an end to ‘land-banking’ and tasteless development on The Bishops Avenue and surrounding cul-de-sacs. The council lists several of the houses — many adorned with turrets, weather vanes and curly gables — as neo-Jacobean, neo-Georgian or Colonial Georgian. Now, to add insult to injury, the properties are not only vulgar but falling down. And if the bats and owls have their way, they will remain derelict for a very long time to come.","Some 15 mansions worth a total of £350 million on The Bishops Avenue, in North-West London, are unoccupied and have been left to rot .

"A carpenter who spent three years and more than £1million building a full-scale replica of Noah's Ark has opened it to the public. As many as 3,000 tourists a day can step aboard Johan Huibers' gigantic wooden boat in Dordrecht, in the Netherlands, which now boasts two cinemas and a restaurant alongside its menagerie of life-sized plastic animals. Mr Huibers was inspired to embark on the ambitious project after having a dream in which he saw part of his native Netherlands submerged in a flood like the one featured in the Book of Genesis. Faithful recreation: Johan Huibers's replica of the ark, in Dordrecht, in the western Netherlands, is now open to the public . Miracle worker: Mr Huibers poses with two of the life-size plastic animals that live on his 450ft ark . He became obsessed with bringing the story of the Ark to life, and in 2004 he built a half-scale version and floated it along the country's canals. Long before the metric or imperial systems came along, craftsmen in various parts of the world dealt in less precise units known as cubits. As this was based on the length of a forearm, the exact value varies from one ancient civilisation to the next. It is most commonly defined as the distance from the elbow to the middle fingertip. The Biblical cubit is generally thought to be about 18in, but Ancient Egyptian cubit rods measure closer to 20in. Tourists flocked to see the smaller prototype when Mr Huibers opened it to the public, but the proceeds from admissions went straight back into funding his ambition to build a full-size ship. The narrative of the ark, in which God commands Noah to prepare for a great flood sent to purge the world of evil, specifies that the boat was 300 cubits long, 50 cubits wide and 30 cubits high. Mr Huibers converted this ancient unit of measurement, which is based on the length of the forearm, to determine that his recreation had to be about 450ft long. This puts the boat, nicknamed 'Johan's Ark', at more than half the length of the Titanic. And though it may not be able to shelter . two of every animal, as the original story dictates, it can hold 1,500 . people - not to mention a menagerie of plastic creatures including . giraffes, elephants and donkeys, as well as a few live chickens. Two by two: A crocodile and cow are among the fake creatures on board the boat, which weighs almost 3,000 tons . Biblical proportions: A plastic giraffe pokes its head over the bow of the ark, which was inspired by a dream . As it weighs in at almost 3,000 tons and is made from Swedish pine reinforced with steel, it may be hard to believe that the ark is, in fact, seaworthy. It is docked in the western city of Dordrecht, where Mr Huibers, the owner of a construction company, pieced it together with the help of some friends and two of his children. In the 15th century, the city was the site of one of the deadliest floods in history, named St Elizabeth's flood, which is thought to have claimed as many as 10,000 lives. Prototype: The half-scale replica that Mr Huibers built in 2004, later floating it through the Netherlands' canals . Ambition: Mr Huibers stands in front of two model elephants on his first ship in 2007 .

"When Osama Bin Laden was shot dead a year ago, the official line was that he had spent almost five years hiding in total isolation. After the Al Qaeda leader was at long last rooted out, American and Pakistani authorities insisted he had never once left the Abbottabad compound stormed by U.S. special forces. Now, however, two men have revealed to BBC News the remarkable story of the night they hosted the world's most wanted man for dinner. Guest of honour: Two tribesmen have claimed they met Osama Bin Laden in summer 2010 when a convoy of 4x4s brought him to their village in northwest Pakistan . In the dead of night in summer 2010 - a year before Bin Laden was killed - a handful of tribesmen waited in the Waziristan region of north-west Pakistan. Weeks earlier, an unnamed 'important person' had told them to expect the visit. Their guest's name was kept secret, the hosts were not told why he was coming, and only learned the timing of his arrival with just a few hours to go. At about 11pm, a convoy of 4x4s thundered into sight. One of the tribal elders told the BBC: 'A dozen big four-wheel drive vehicles drove into the compound. They seemed to converge from different directions.' One of the vehicles pulled up to the building's veranda and, to the hosts' astonishment, a tall man dressed in robes and a white turban climbed down from the back seat. They could scarcely believe the man before them was Osama Bin Laden, as the terrorist figurehead stood by the car shaking hands. The elder told how he kissed the . guest's hand and pressed it to his eyes, a customary show of respect, . before two assistants led Bin Laden away to the room the villagers had . set up for him. Unruly: Pakistan's tribal north-east, supposedly the site of the secret meeting, has been described as one of the most dangerous places on Earth . So . shrouded in secrecy was this meeting, it was not until the earth-shaking . event of Bin Laden's assassination that one of the hosts was shocked . into revealing it had ever taken place. Even . with the Al Qaeda leader long dead, the two tribesmen who spoke out . about the dinner did so only on condition of anonymity and the promise . that the exact location of the meeting would not be revealed. Nor would . they identify the man who arranged it, or any of Bin Laden's sizeable . entourage. Bin Laden . spent three hours with the men, in a settlement about 180 miles from the . Pakistani garrison town where he would meet his bloody fate. During . that time, they said, the feared jihadi offered prayers, rested and ate a . meal of lamb chops, chicken curry and rice. Turbulent: Pakistani army soldiers take position in South Waziristan, near the border with Afghanistan. Bin Laden would have had to pass under the noses of such patrols to reach his supposed hosts . Security was strict throughout, with armed men guarding the compound's gate, roof and along the walls - barring any of the hosts from leaving. The guards were wary when one of the hosts asked that his elderly father be allowed to meet the notorious Bin Laden, pleading that it was the 85-year-old's dying wish. Bin Laden said he would grant the old man's wish, and four armed henchmen marched the son home to fetch his father - who was not told whom he was meeting until they were safely inside the compound. The two tribesmen recalled how they and their guests smiled knowningly as the old man spoke for 10 minutes, passing on tips on tribal warfare and lavishing praise on the infamous guest - none of which Bin Laden understood, as it was spoken in the man's native Pashto language. When the time came for the Al Qaeda . chief and his men to leave, they did so just as they had arrived, . apparently scattering in several directions to leave no clue as to where . Bin Laden's car was headed. This . mysterious event leaves much unexplained. Pakistan's tribal north west . is a region of continuing unrest, and at the time the country's forces . would have been on high alert, with a gauntlet checkpoints set up to . monitor traffic and crack down on militants. If . the tribesmen's tale is to be believed - and especially if other such . visits come to light - it will surely cast doubt on the Pakistani . authorities' claims that they did all they could to bring Bin Laden to justice.","Two men claim they played host to the Al Qaeda leader after a huge convoy of 4x4s rolled into their village .

"Jailed: Sergeant Alexander Blackman has been given a life sentence for murdering an Afghan insurgent in Helmand province . A Royal Marine who murdered an insurgent in Afghanistan said last night he was devastated over the decision to jail him for life. Sergeant Alexander Blackman, 39, was told he would serve at least ten years for murdering the Afghan national in Helmand province in 2011. He has also been dismissed from the Marines in disgrace. But yesterday his commanding officer pledged his ‘full support’ for his comrade, saying Blackman had been ‘tainted’ by experiences described as ‘hell on earth’. Last night a huge wave of support was . swelling for the first British serviceman to be convicted of murder on . active service abroad since the Second World War. One . Facebook group has nearly 30,000 supporters and is calling for Blackman . to be released. Another group has more than 10,000 followers. In court, Blackman stood tall in his dress uniform and saluted for one last time as Judge Advocate General Jeff Blackett passed judgment. His face impassive, he turned sharply to his left and marched out of the court. The 6ft 3in commando was told by the country’s most senior military judge that his ‘brutal and savage’ crime had ‘betrayed’ Britain’s armed forces and ‘tarnished their reputation’. And he had ‘put at risk’ the lives of other UK troops and civilians by increasing the likelihood that Islamic extremists would carry out revenge attacks. In a withering sentencing statement, Judge Blackett said: ‘You have provided ammunition to the terrorists whose propaganda portrays the British presence in Afghanistan as part of a war on Islam in which civilians are arbitrarily killed. ‘Committing this sort of act could well provoke the enemy to act more brutally towards British troops in retribution or reprisal.’ But in a letter read to the court, Lieutenant Colonel Simon Chapman, commanding officer of 42 Commando, said Blackman had faced ‘incomprehensible pressures with great fortitude and dignity’. Hearing: Blackman was told he had 'betrayed' the rest of the military with his actions . Emotional: Alexander Blackman pictured with his wheelchair-bound father Brian who died shortly before his tour of duty . Lt Col Chapman said a ‘momentary and fatal lapse of judgment’ had ‘altered his life immeasurably’. He added: ‘He had so much to behold – a proud career and a promising future. Sadly, this is no longer the case. He is not a bad man. In almost every respect, he is a normal citizen tainted only by the impact of war.’ In a statement read outside the court martial, Blackman, of Taunton, Somerset, said he was ‘devastated’. ‘Sgt Blackman and his wife are devastated by the life sentence imposed upon him together with the order that he serve a minimum of ten years before he is eligible for parole,’ said his lawyer. Footage: The incident in which Blackman killed a Taliban militant was caught on camera by another Marine . Incident: The footage filmed by Marine B's helmet camera formed part of the court martial hearing . ‘Furthermore, he has been dismissed . with disgrace from the Royal Marines, with whom he has served proudly . for 15 years. He is very sorry for any damage caused to the Royal . Marines.’ The experienced commando thanked the public ‘for the support shown to him and his wife’. He is appealing the sentence. The . court martial in Bulford, Wiltshire, heard Blackman was suffering from . combat stress when he murdered the Taliban captive and was trying to . deal with the grief of his father’s death months earlier. He lost his cool near the end of a ‘tour from hell’, during which 23 servicemen from 3 Commando Brigade lost their lives and insurgents hung the limbs of maimed British troops in trees as ‘trophies’. Revealed: Footage of the incident with Blackman's face uncensored was released for the first time after he was sentenced . Film: The Marine could be heard quoting Shakespeare as he shot the Taliban prisoner . His badly injured victim had been . found with an AK47 assault rifle and grenade after an Apache helicopter . blitzed him with cannon fire following an attack on a British base. Blackman . shot the injured insurgent in the chest at close range with a 9mm . pistol in Afghanistan, then taunted him: ‘Shuffle off this mortal coil, . you c***.’ It’s nothing you wouldn’t do to us.’ Blackman, who served with 42 Commando, then told his comrades: ‘I just broke the Geneva Convention.’ Harrowing . film and audio recordings of the ‘field execution’ in a cornfield, . captured on a helmet-mounted camera worn by a comrade, were played to . the trial. 'Devastated': The Marine and his wife spoke of their anguish at the heavy sentence . The . commando, who completed six gruelling tours of Iraq, Afghanistan and . Northern Ireland during 15 years with the Marines, was convicted of . slaying the insurgent on September 15, 2011. He denied murder, claiming . he thought the insurgent was already dead. Sentencing . Blackman, Judge Blackett said: ‘You treated that Afghan man with . contempt and murdered him in cold blood. You have betrayed your corps . and all British service personnel who have served in Afghanistan, and . you have tarnished their reputation. ‘You . were obliged to care for him but instead you executed him.’ Anthony . Berry QC, defending Blackman, said the commando had been deployed in . ‘hell on earth’. The Marines knew that if they were captured they would meet a grisly fate – ‘skinned alive and beheaded’. Mr Berry said that during the six-month tour, Blackman was suffering from ‘poor sleep, fatigue, the grief that resulted from the death of his father, and feelings, though unspoken, of paranoia that he was going to be shot at every time he stepped out on patrol’. By CLAIRE ELLICOTT . Supporters of Sergeant Alexander Blackman took to Facebook and Twitter yesterday to protest against his ten-year prison sentence. The thousands of comments posted on the websites included: . Terry Wright: ‘Ten years’ imprisonment for killing a member of the Taliban, yet killing Bin Laden in his bedroom was fine. He is still a human being, what’s the difference? Of course, silly old me, forgot the governments of this world can do what they please!’ oilywater@rumandcoffee: ‘So Marine A goes down for life, 10 years min. That’s going to inflict more damage to the Marines than the Taliban ever could.’ Jeanette Carter: ‘It’s a war! Who could blame him for shooting that guy after  witnessing his comrades’ legs hanging in the trees. I think the Taliban b*****d was very lucky to be granted a quick end to his miserable life!’ Messages of support: Many people took to Twitter to express their outrage at the sentence . Penny Johnson: ‘What is the world coming to. We need a government who will stand up for British people.’ Shannon Cross: ‘Absolutely ridiculous! That Taliban member would have shot first if he wasn’t injured! I wonder how many people he had already killed!’ Florence Green: ‘So angry, this brave man should NEVER have been charged. Should have been given a medal. Talk about lions led by donkeys!’ Paul Manning: ‘Locking him up is a disgrace. How many innocent people did the swine he killed kill? All he has done is left us with one less terrorist. Guy deserves a medal, not a jail sentence!’ Many expressed shocked at the length of the sentence handed to Sergeant Alexander Blackman . Former Lance Corporal Matt Croucher, the most highly decorated Marine to serve in Iraq and Afghanistan, said the sentence was unfair. ‘I find it quite morally baffling that he could get a ten-year sentence when someone like Baby P’s mother only served a few years,’ he said. ‘If you put these people next to each other, the moral gap is huge. He has been given a longer sentence than some rapists and child molesters. ‘People think he murdered someone in cold blood. But that person was a terrorist insurgent intent on killing British personnel and maiming them and, given half a chance, would do the same thing here.’","Alexander Blackman was filmed shooting wounded fighter in September 2011 .

"A heart patient was told he was fit for work - just a day after a double heart bypass operation. Danny Shurmer, 60, received the letter from a healthcare firm working on behalf of the Government as he recovered in the intensive care unit of Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital. His is one of a number of cases in which sick and disabled people have been ordered back to work under the Government's controversial Work Capability Assessment.

Mr Shurmer said: 'I was in intensive care when my daughter came in with the letter. I was shocked. Even the consultant could not believe it.' Mr Shurmer's employment and support allowance (ESA) - a benefit which has replaced incapacity benefit - was later stopped. It was only restarted after he went to a tribunal. He was given the 'fit for work' bombshell weeks after a medical examination by doctors from French healthcare firm ATOS, which carries out the Work Capability Assessment on behalf of the Department of Work and Pensions. Optimistic? Mr Shurmer won an appeal against the withdrawal of his benefits . Mr Shurmer, who didn't win his . tribunal until nine months after the withdrawal of benefit, had three . more bypasses in July this year at the same hospital. He was examined again last week by an ATOS doctor and is awaiting a decision. Asked whether he is optimistic or not, he replied 'God knows'. The Government ordered fresh assessments on thousands of people claiming incapacity benefits back in 2010. Charities have voiced concern that the the Work Capability Assessment is unfair. Richard Hawkes, chief executive of disability charity Scope said: 'The latest figures released showing the number of people found 'fit for work' need to be taken with a large pinch of salt. There remains an alarming dossier of evidence that the Work Capability Assessment is a deeply flawed test. But DWP statistics show 41% of claimants have appealed against decisions on their benefits after the tests, with 38% having previous decisions overturned. Factoring in these successful appeals would significantly lower the number of people found 'fit for work'. A DWP spokesperson said:‬‪ 'A decision on whether someone is well enough to work is taken following a thorough face to face assessment and after consideration of all the supporting medical evidence provided by the claimant at the time. 'We encourage people to provide as much medical evidence as possible when they apply for ESA. There will inevitably be a period of time between someone’s assessment and them receiving their letter.‬‬ ‪‬‪‪ . 'Since 2010 we have considerably improved the Work Capability Assessment process, giving people a more tailored and personal service. If someone disagrees with the outcome of their work capability assessment, they have the right to submit new evidence and appeal.'

The cause of death has not yet been disclosed, by the veteran rocker underwent a liver transplant in May. Best known as the founder, guitarist and lead singer/songwriter of 1960s band The Velvet Underground, the star went on to have an illustrious solo career, with hits such as 'Walk On The Wild Side.' Scroll down for video . Rocker: Lou Reed and The Velvet Underground were part of 1960s New York's thriving artistic scene . Reed died in Southampton, New York of an ailment related to his recent liver transplant, according to his literary agent, Andrew Wylie, who added that Reed had been in frail health for months. Reed shared a home in Southampton with his wife and fellow musician, Laurie Anderson, whom he married in 2008. The punk, New Wave and alternative rock . movements of the 1970s, `80s and `90s were all indebted to Reed, whose . songs were covered by R.E.M., Nirvana, Patti Smith and countless others. Many celebrities, both fans and friends, took to Twitter to express their grief at Reed's passing. Okkervil River tweeted, 'Lou Reed might have been the single biggest influence on my music and his encouragement changed my life. I'm devastated.' 'R.I.P. Lou Reed and thank you and the Velvets.

Top billing: Lou Reed (second left) with Lynyrd Skynyrd and Leslie West at the Beacon Theater in New York, 1974 . Icons: Lou Reed with The Pretenders' Chrissy Hynde in 1989 . Reed was one of rock's archetypal tough guys, but he grew up middle class - an accountant's son raised on Long Island. Reed was born to be a suburban dropout. He hated school, loved rock n' roll, fought with his parents and attacked them in song for forcing him to undergo electroshock therapy as a supposed 'cure' for being bisexual. 'Families that live out in the suburbs often make each other cry,' he later wrote. Reed introduced avant garde rock to mainstream music and has been credited as having a significant impact on American culture. He never approached the commercial success of such superstars as the Beatles and Bob Dylan, but no songwriter to emerge after Dylan so radically expanded the territory of rock lyrics. And no band did more than the Velvet Underground to open rock music to the avant-garde - to experimental theater, art, literature and film, to William Burroughs and Kurt Weill, to John Cage and Andy Warhol, Reed's early patron.

'And look where I was - I . was next to the greatest artist of the 20th century. Not that I knew . that at the time.' The Velvet Underground was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame in 1996. 'I . always thought we were easily the most sophisticated, articulate group . in the world,' Reed stated. 'We didn't get to keep going because of . strife. But there was no one near us - to this day. 'If . you look note by note, word by word, subject by subject, my idea was . essentially: What would happen if you had the lyrics of Tennessee . Williams or William Burroughs and you put it in a rock context? That was . my idea, and I was trying to write up to that.' As a songwriter, Reed broke new ground by . writing songs about taboo subjects as S&M, transvestites and . transsexuals, prostitution, and drug addiction. Following his departure from The Velvet Underground in 1970, Reed began a solo career that would span several decades. He . collaborated with many artists over the course of his career, including . David Bowie, Antony and the Johnsons and Kate McGarrigle.' Reviewing Reed's 1989 topical album 'New York,' Village Voice critic Robert Christgau wrote that 'the pleasure of the lyrics is mostly tone and delivery - plus the impulse they validate, their affirmation that you can write songs about this stuff. Protesting, elegizing, carping, waxing sarcastic, forcing jokes, stating facts, garbling what he just read in the Times, free-associating to doomsday, Lou carries on a New York conversation - all that's missing is a disquisition on real estate.' Reed's New York was a jaded city of drag queens, drug addicts and violence, but it was also as wondrous as any Allen comedy, with so many of Reed's songs explorations of right and wrong and quests for transcendence. As frontman of the Velvet Underground and a prolific solo artist, Lou Reed was an inspirational musician and lyricist to generations. Many of his albums are essential listening. The Velvet Underground & Nico (1967) - The debut album by The Velvet Underground and vocal collaborator Nico is one of the most critically acclaimed rock records ever. It includes celebrated songs such as Sunday Morning, All Tomorrow's Parties and I'm Waiting For The Man. The Velvet Underground (1969) - After the more experimental White Light/White Heat record (1968), The Velvet Underground returned to a more straight forward and melodic style. This record includes songs such as Candy Says, Beginning To See The Light, Pale Blue Eyes and What Goes On. Transformer (1972) - This is Reed's second solo album after recording only four records with the The Velvet Underground. Transformer includes well-loved hits such as Perfect Day, Walk On The Wild Side and Satellite Of Love. As a solo artist Reed released 22 studio albums, 12 live albums, 15 compilation albums and 44 singles. Rock legend: Lou Reed, dubbed the ¿godfather of punk rock¿, was unrepentant about his drug dependency . Friends and lovers: Reed pictured with longtime collaborator David Bowie (left) and with his wife, Laurie Anderson (right) Man of the times: Lou Reed with wife Laurie Anderson at the GQ Man of the Year awards in London in September 2013 . He lived many lives in the `70s, initially moving back home and working at his father's office, then competing with Keith Richards as the rock star most likely to die. He binged on drugs and alcohol, gained weight, lost even more and was described by critic Lester Bangs as 'so transcendently emaciated he had indeed become insectival.' Reed simulated shooting heroin during concerts, cursed out journalists and once slugged David Bowie when Bowie suggested he clean up his life. An outlaw in his early years, Reed would eventually perform at the White House, have his writing published in The New Yorker, be featured by PBS in an 'American Masters' documentary and win a Grammy in 1999 for Best Long Form Music Video. The Velvet Underground was inducted into the Rock and Roll of Fame in 1996 and their landmark debut album, 'The Velvet Underground & Nico,' was added to the Library of Congress' registry in 2006. Though . he is said to have been uninspired by the current state of the music . industry and lack of talented stars, one person that he did admire was, . perhaps surprisingly, Kanye West. Final message: Lou Reed was active on Twitter this morning, posting this picture to his account with the caption, 'The door.' 'The . only person who's out there really doing something is Kanye West. This . guy is really serious, trying to do something,' he said. 'This new album . of his is hard to believe. It's incredible - the mixture of genres, the . melodies, the sounds. He's really good, whatever you might think of him . on other levels. And he's also very, very funny.' He remained an avid and interesting artist, branching out into photography and released two book of his work, 'Emotions in Action' and 'Lou Reed's New York.' Reed interacted with fans regularly, with a Facebook page and a Twitter account with more than 42,000 followers. His last Tweet was posted this morning, a picture of a door with a Lou Reed poster on it. He remained active in his solo career, and interactive with his fans until the last day. His Twitter account, with over 42,000 followers, was frequently updated. Reed's last tweet was posted Sunday morning. It said only 'The Door' and posted a Facebook link to a picture of him on a closed door. Reid is survived by his wife, Laurie Anderson.","Lou Reed has died at the age of 71 .

"They may not be the most elegant of names, but they are certainly eye-catching. And no one could blame the postman if he titters when he's delivering letters to homes in Bum, Tittybong, Climax or Intercourse. Now someone has created an interactive map of the world's most suggestive place names - and probably become a hero to immature teenagers everywhere. Nob Hill can be spotted on the map, which will surely become a much loved website of anyone with an infantile sense of humour . San Francisco's Nob Hill may raise eyebrows with its unfortunate name - but at least it will give residents a laugh . Those living in Tittybong, Australia must surely be tired of seeing people smirk when they tell them where they live . Perhaps Tittybong's name put residents off staying there - as the lonely looking area in Australia is deserted . Among the others highlighted on the map are Poo in India, Pee in Liberia, Bitche in France and Arsoli in Italy. And if those weren't enough to prompt a snigger, there's Vagina in Russia, Anus in the Philippines and Gland in Switzerland. There are places with names to make you blush - but you'll have to find them yourselves. The map titled Vaguely Rude Place Names Of The World was created by geographer and Nokia's director of places Gary Dale from south-west London. Toilet humour: The town of Poo in Spain is certain to prompt a chuckle from those with an imaginative mind . Poo in Spain has a beach - and is considered to be a far nicer place than its name might initially suggest . A high point of the map is Climax,  Georgia - which might conjure up a couple of images that homeowners there don't want you to think about . Climax in Georgia is sure to be popular with those roaming the map for more giggles . Bald Knob, Arkansas, US . Phuket, Thailand . Shyte Brook, Shropshire, UK . Spanker Knob, Australia . Bumbang, Australia, . Fanny's Cross, Devon, UK . Wet Beaver Creek, Arizona, US . Seymen, Turkey . Crotch Lake, Ontario, Canada . Sandy Balls Estate, Hampshire, UK . Mr Dale modestly describes his work as 'a classic Web 2.0 style maps mashup [that will] never win any awards for originality or innovativeness'. 'Maybe it's part of bring British, but an airport whose code is BUM is just … funny,' he said. 'The source of each of these vaguely rude sounding names was from Yahoo's WOE data set, before the data was released via the GeoPlanet API and (currently offline) GeoPlanet Data download.'A list of real but amusing sounding place names, culled from GeoPlanet by one of the old Yahoo! Geo team, has been sitting in a file on one of my backup drives for too many years now.'But given a geographic data set. Stamen's wonderful Toner map tiles and a JavaScript maps API, in this case Leaflet, the temptation to make a map out of it all was just too strong.'Yes it's a map, yes it's geographical innuendo and yes, it's very much part of the British sense of humour.'If you're British, try not to snigger too much; if you're not British, just shake your head sadly and mutter ""those crazy Brits"".' The UK has more than its fair share of rude place names, not least Six Mile Bottom in Cambridgeshire . Snigger, snigger: Bum, in Sierra Leone, west Africa, would make most schoolboys laugh . Spread Eagle in Newfoundland, Canada, is one of the more polite place names . Intercourse in Pennsylvania, U.S., is another place with a very unfortunate name .","Have you been to Poo in Spain, Bitche in France or Arsoli in Italy?

"The search for alien life has so far focused on planets that are similar to Earth. But astronomers may have missed a trick by looking too closely at worlds that are like our own, according to a new report. The study suggests there may be planets that do not necessarily look like Earth, but that could have environments more favourable to supporting life. Scroll down for video . Superhabitable worlds would most likely be two to three times bigger than Earth and much older, the researchers say. Given these characteristics, Alpha Centauri B, a member of the closest stellar system to the sun, is an ideal target for searches of a superhabitable world . ‘In my point of view, astronomers and biologists are biased,’ Rene Heller, an astrophysicist at Canada's McMaster University who is the study's lead author, told NPR. Scientists believe 'superhabitable' planets would most likely be two to three times bigger than Earth and much older. They believe any liquid would be found over the surface of the planet in shallow reservoirs rather than in giant, deep oceans. Like . Earth, the planets would have a magnetic field to shield them from . space weather. However, scientists predict that the planets would have . much thicker atmospheres. In the study ‘Superhabitable Worlds’, Professor Heller proposes that tidal heating can create conditions where life could emerge on an icy or terrestrial planet once thought to be uninhabitable. Tidal heating is the frictional heating . of a satellite's core caused by the gravitational pull of its parent . planet and possibly neighbouring satellites. These planets would most likely be two to three times bigger than Earth and much older, the researchers say. They believe any liquid would be found over the surface of the planet in shallow reservoirs rather than in giant, deep oceans. Given these characteristics, they claim Alpha Centauri B, a member of the closest stellar system to the sun, is an ideal target for searches of a superhabitable world. 'From a potpourri of habitable worlds that may exist, Earth might well turn out as one that is marginally habitable, even bizarre from a biocentric standpoint,' the researchers write. In the study 'Superhabitable Worlds', Professor Heller proposes that tidal heating can create conditions where life could emerge on an icy or terrestrial planet once thought to be uninhabitable. Pictured is an artist's impression of an exoplanet . The Goldilocks zone is the belt around a star where temperatures are ideal for liquid water to pool on a planet's surface. To determine the location of a star's habitable zone, scientists have to first learn how much total radiation it emits. Knowing precisely how far away a habitable zone needs to be from a star also depends on chemistry. For example, molecules in a planet's atmosphere will absorb a certain amount of energy from starlight and radiate the rest back out. How much of this energy is trapped can mean the difference between a turquoise sea and erupting volcanoes. Like Earth, the planets would have a magnetic field to shield them from space weather. However, scientists predict that the planets would have much thicker atmospheres. ‘A tidally heated planet would be unpleasant though spectacular to visit,’ said Norman Sleep, Senior Editor for Astrobiology and Professor in the School of Earth Sciences at Stanford University. Current studies suggest that super-Earths are more common than Earth-size planets . So far, scientists have detected about a thousand planets orbiting other stars in something known as the Goldilocks zone. The Goldilocks zone is the belt around a star where temperatures are ideal for liquid water to pool on a planet's surface. This has started a race to find the one that most resembles Earth. But in a separate study, UK researchers suggested that Earth-sized planets can support life at least ten times further away from stars than previously thought. This means that cold rocky planets previously considered uninhabitable may be teeming with life beneath the surface. Academics at the University of Aberdeen and University of St Andrews believe the definition of the ‘Goldilocks’ zone is flawed. They argue this definition fails to take into account life that can exist beneath a planet’s surface.

"Gun safety advocate: Michael Underwood (pictured) has avoided a jail sentence for the shooting of friend Nate Maki, but has a number of conditions attached to his plea deal . An 18-year-old who accidentally shot dead his friend while he had been drinking on a hunting trip has escaped jail after agreeing to become an advocate for gun safety. Michael Bryce Underwood received a five-year probation with an automatic two-year term in prison if he violates his probation, according to a court in Montague County District Court in Texas. Judge Vicki Isaacs also ruled that Underwood will have to finish high school, cannot drink alcohol and must speak publicly about gun safety. Underwood was arrested in October after his friend Nathan Maki, an 18-year-old fullback for the Guyer High School's football team, was shot with a rifle during a Labor Day weekend camping trip. The teenagers had been camping with two female friends. Maki's body was found in a pickup truck in a field near Bowie, Texas. Underwood had alerted police, who found beer cans, a rifle and a shotgun at the scene. Underwood had told responders at the time that the pair had been hunting and he was outside the pickup truck taking aim at an animal when he shot the .22-caliber rifle, according to a search warrant affidavit. Loss: Nathan Maki, 18, is pictured with his girlfriend Peyton Bucklew. He was killed while on a camping trip with friend Michael Underwood . Trip: Maki, pictured, was camping on the land he was due to go hunting on when the accident happened . He was sentenced after pleading guilty to criminally negligent homicide. In court on Monday, Paige Williams, a district attorney for Montague County, read a victim impact statement from Maki's mother, who forgave Underwood for the accident. Regarding the plea arrangement, Ms Williams told Dallas News: 'It was the right outcome for everybody involved.' At the time of the accident, Maki's girlfriend, Peyton Bucklew, paid tribute to her 'best friend'. 'Football was everything to him,' she said. 'Those are his brothers out there. He would do anything for them. It will be hard, but I know they are going to go out there and play for him.' Guyer Head Coach John Walsh said at the time he was shocked at the death. Oschlor Flemming, who coaches the running backs for the high school team, added: 'Nathan [was] a great kid... He always had a big smile on his face. I don't think he had an enemy in the world.","Body of Nate Maki was found in pickup truck after hunting trip .

"A cancer-stricken man on his deathbed claims he watched men bury Jimmy Hoffa's body in a driveway in suburban Detroit a just days after the union boss's disappearance in 1975. The anonymous tipster reportedly kept the dark secret for 37 years because he was terrified that the mob, who whoever killed Hoffa, would come after him. The FBI and most observers are skeptical that the Teamsters leader's remains are below the concrete slab in Roseville, Michigan, however one journalist who has talked to the dying man says he is no fraud -- the informant believes his own story. Where in the world? Jimmy Hoffa, pictured in 1966, was last seen at a suburban Detroit restaurant in 1975. His disappearance remains one of great mysteries in American history . The wait: Results of the soil testing at the driveway were revealed on Tuesday afternoon . Not a burial spot: This driveway in Roseville, Michigan, was the focus of the investigation after a cancer-stricken tipster said Hoffa may have been buried there . Tourist attraction: Onlookers stop to take pictures at the alleged burial site in Roseville, Michigan . Neighbors say the the house where authorities are searching for Hoffa's body was a possible gambling den in 1975. They recalled seeing cars coming and going from the home at strange hours, however, the family of four that lived there moved away before police closed in. A scan by ground-penetrating radar confirmed that the earth below the concrete pad had been disturbed and that there is likely 'something' down there. However, police and the FBI remain skeptical that it's actually Jimmy Hoffa. The tipster came forward months ago after first speaking with Dan Moldea, a journalist and author of the book 'Hoffa Wars,' the Detroit News reported. The man, who has no mob connections, was simply at the wrong place at the wrong time when he watched men bury a black bag -- which he took to be a body -- days after Hoffa disappeared, Mr Moldea said. Mr Moldea said he, too, is skeptical of the claim. g . However, the man is 'adamant' that house is the final resting place of the fame union leader -- who got on the bad side of the mob while leading the Teamsters to national prominence. 'This is not a mob guy. He's not connected. He's just a guy in the right place at the right time, or the wrong place at the wrong time,' Mr Moldea told the News. 'He's scared to death right now. I believe that he believes what he said. He's not a con man. Now, it's a question of whether something is there. If not Hoffa, (maybe it's) a homicide victim or root of a tree. I just don't know.' Meanwhile, neighbors added to speculation that the house in question might have been involved in a criminal enterprise. 'People going in and out, cars coming at all hours of the night. My neighbor told me police were investigating whether a numbers operation was being run out of here,' one man told WDIV-TV. Roseville Police Chief James Berlin said his office is 'not claiming it's Jimmy Hoffa' but is 'investigating a body that may be at the location.' The union boss was last seen outside a suburban Detroit restaurant on July 30, 1975. His body has not been found despite a number of searches over the years and the case remains one of the biggest mysteries in modern American history. Unearthed: On July 16, 2003, authorities search under a backyard pool in Hampton Township, Michigan . Other attempts: In May of 2004, investigators ripped up floorboards of a home in the Detroit suburbs where one-time Jimmy Hoffa ally Frank Sheeran claims to have killed him . Hunt continues: In 2006, searchers in formation inspected a field at Hidden Dreams Farm in Milford Township, Michigan . Stadium burial? Self-described hit man Donald Frankos claimed Hoffa was buried under Giants Stadium - which was demolished in 2010 . Innumerable theories about the demise of the union boss have been rampant ever since. Among them: He was entombed in concrete at Giants Stadium in New Jersey, ground up and thrown in a Florida swamp or obliterated in a mob-owned fat-rendering plant. The search has continued under a backyard pool north of Detroit in 2003, under the floor of a Detroit home in 2004 and at a horse farm northwest of Detroit in 2006. After Roseville police received the most . recent tip, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality used . ground penetrating radar on a 12-foot-by-12-foot patch beneath the . driveway, said agency spokesman Brad Wurfel. It found 'that the earth had been disturbed at some point in time,' Berlin said. Berlin said state environmental officials last week found 'an anomaly' while using radar to check the driveway. The FBI, however, is skeptical. Jimmy Hoffa waves to delegates at the opening of the Teamsters Union convention at Miami Beach, Florida in 1957 . Former agent John Anthony, who spent years investigating . Hoffa’s disappearance, told WDIV-TV: 'I would say it has no credibility at all. It doesn’t . match up with anything we already know. I'd say it’s just another story - someone . trying to get publicity or looking after a reward.' A soil sample will be taken Friday and tested at Michigan State University for human decomposition. Believed dead: Hoffa was declared legally deceased on July 30, 1982, when he would have been 69 . A woman who lives at the home on Florida Street told the Detroit Free Press that she's 'fully aware of what’s going on,' but declined to be interviewed. Police told the paper that the . homeowner, who has lived at the home for more than a decade, has been . cooperative in their investigation. Hoffa was declared legally dead July 30, 1982, when he would have been 69. He was a union stalwart, serving as its General President from 1958 to 1971 and playing a key part in its growth and development. During his term as its leader, membership surged to more than 1.5 million members, becoming the largest single union in the country. After Roseville police received the most recent tip, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality used ground penetrating radar on a 12-foot-by-12-foot patch beneath the driveway, said agency spokesman Brad Wurfel. It found 'that the earth had been disturbed at some point in time,' Berlin said. Results are not expected until next week. Andrew Arena, who recently retired as head of the FBI in Michigan, told Detroit TV station WDIV that all leads must be followed, but he would be surprised if Hoffa is buried there.","Teamsters boss last seen at suburban Detroit restaurant on July 30, 1975 .

'Lydia first spoke about Travis Forbes before she . was even able to speak,' he told MailOnline. 'She prepared a letter of forgiveness . that our father read out in court and she hasn't looked back. Scroll down for video . Fighter: Lydia Tillman, who was brutally beaten, raped and left for dead in July 2011, is pictured with her sister Esther Tillman after they ran a race together earlier this year . 'She refuses to waste her time angry at him. Lydia's amazing but we all feel that way. There is no point wasting any time or anger on him because he's gone for good.' Forbes, who was caught after his DNA was found under Lydia's fingernails, was sentenced to 48 years in prison after he admitted to the attack and the murder of another woman, Kenia Monge. Jacob, a skateboarder and artist, recounted getting the call about his sister's attack as he was near the Rockies, around two hours from where Lydia had slipped into a coma at a Denver hospital. 'It was terrible,' he said. 'My sister Esther called me as I was at a rest stop. She told me Lydia had been attacked and and raped and that she was unconscious. I drove there right away.' When he arrived at the hospital, he found his sister bloodied, bruised and with numerous tubes feeding into her broken body. 'She was so unstable they couldn't even take her off the temporary life support tubes to make her more comfortable,' he said. 'We didn't know if she was going to survive.' Injuries: Lydia suffered a stroke after the horrific attack that left her in a coma for five weeks. Her jaw was shattered and she was left with a broken wrist and ribs . After Lydia suffered a stroke, the doctors put her in a medically induced coma to control the blood clot that was in an artery in her neck, just inches from her brain. When she awoke after five weeks in the coma, she was unable to speak or walk. 'She was obviously the same sister I had known,' he said. 'You could tell she was obviously all there, but she couldn't speak at all. 'Even automatic sounds like laughing were silent - her shoulders jerked but there was no sound. She thought it was to do with tubes in her throat but it really was the brain injuries.' After a few more weeks in hospital she was moved to a physical therapy unit where she spent three months re-learning how to walk and talk - and despite the grueling battle, she remained upbeat. 'She was very, very positive,' her brother remembered. 'She definitely gets frustrated at times and angry that this has happened to her but mostly she's just really positive.' Hurt: Lydia is pictured walking back to her seat after making a statement at a hearing last year where Travis Forbes confessed to assaulting her. In her statement she said she forgave her attacker . Changed life: Lydia, pictured before the attack, had to learn how to speak and walk again with the help of physical therapy. Her brother said she still has to think before she can form a sentence . Speaking to NBC, her doctor  Rebecca Bearden added: 'I believe that Lydia shouldn't have . survived that day. She . went through so much and she probably shouldn't have made it but she . did, and it was because of her determination and her joy.' When Lydia left and moved in with her stepbrother and his family, she had mastered 10 words. She now lives independently and can say just as much as before the accident - with a little more effort. 'She's able to speak now but it takes a lot of concentration,' Jacob said. 'She knows what she wants to say but has to think about how to say it.' The next step is for Lydia to undergo a special reconstructive jaw surgery in January. It will help her with speech development but costs a staggering $65,000. Her insurance only pays for a procedure that would wire her jaw shut - a move which would reverse her speech therapy by stopping her from practicing words regularly, her brother said. Help: Lydia's brother Jacob, a skateboarder and artist, hopes to raise $65,000 so for her jaw surgery . Jacob, who is based in New York, is now trying to raise the money for the operation with his Still Kickin' campaign. As well as accepting donations online, he also plans to hold fundraising events. He has already received more than $24,000 from around 400 donations. 'She's really excited about this,' he added. 'She's moving on. She could have died but I'm so glad she was alive and that she could defeat this guy. She sees it that she won.' Lydia managed to escape the attack, which occurred after Forbes followed her home from a July 4 celebration, by jumping from a window and hiding until emergency vehicles responded to the fire. She ran towards an ambulance and when the paramedics asked whether she knew her attacker, she repeatedly told them 'No, no, no' before suffering the stroke. Unknown to her, Forbes had killed 19-year-old Kenia Monge and hidden her body in a freezer just months earlier. Killed: Lydia's attacker had murdered Kenia Monge, pictured, just months before. When he was arrested, he was walking a drunk college girl back to her apartment . Case: Lydia stands with Nash Gurule, the Denver detective in the Monge case who connected the attackers . A detective in Denver investigating the murder heard of Lydia's story and realised the attacker had used bleach in both cases. Authorities matched the DNA from under Lydia's nail to Travis Forbes, the suspect in Monge’s murder. A week later, he was arrested while walking a drunk college student home. He confessed to both the assaults after prosecutors agreed to not to charge him under the death penalty. He was charged with murder and attempted murder, and was sentenced to life in prison. Lydia was in a coma when he was arrested but later composed a statement to be read in court. 'Travis Forbes, you caused me no harm. My spirit, my soul and my mind remain untouched. May you find peace in this life,' it read. She added to ABC: 'It was my intention to find the strength in my heart to forgive Travis Forbes. I did. I felt extreme anger toward him, then I felt sad for him. He must be in so much extreme pain to so brutally hurt another human.'

"Politicians who do not believe in climate change should be 'crushed and buried', according to a speech given by Sir Paul Nurse (pictured) Politicians who do not believe in climate change should be 'crushed and buried', according to the new president of the British Science Association. Sir Paul Nurse, who starts his presidency next week, pledged to 'take on' the 'serial offenders' who he accused of cherry picking scientific facts to suit their arguments. In an extraordinary outburst, Sir Paul accused those who refuse to accept scientific orthodoxy on global warming of 'distorting' the facts. Sir Paul launched what could be interpreted as a thinly-veiled attack on former Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, who is widely viewed as a climate sceptic. He also targeted climate sceptic lobby groups such as that run by former Chancellor Lord Nigel Lawson. Mr Paterson, who was sacked by David Cameron in July, has said he believes the negative impact of global warming has been exaggerated - to the exasperation of climate scientists. Sir Paul, speaking in London yesterday, said: 'Today we have those who mix science up with ideology and politics, where opinion, rhetoric and tradition hold more sway than adherence to evidence and logical argument. 'There have been ministers - recent past ministers - who have paid attention to some parts of science with respect to genetically modified crops and apparently not other parts with respect to climate change.' Mr Paterson is a fierce supporter of the drive for GM food - a cause which earned him friends in science, but the fury of many consumers. Sir Paul launched a thinly-veiled attack on former Environment Secretary Owen Paterson (pictured), who is widely viewed as a climate sceptic. He also targeted climate sceptic lobby groups . Sir Paul said: 'Politicians live in a world where the strength of their rhetoric means much more than scientific content. 'They can't play with science - they have to listen to science and scientists. 'But when they are serial offenders - and there are serial offenders - they should be crushed and buried. 'I think if we cannot get politicians and lobbyists to take scientists seriously we need to take them on. 'And I am certainly prepared to do that. I have done in the past.' The scientist also criticised Lord Lawson's (pictured) Global Warming Policy Foundation, a climate-sceptic think tank. Sir Paul said: 'We have to be aware and beware organisations that pretend to talk about science but masquerade as lobby groups' Sir Paul, who will expand on his comments during his inaugural address at the British Science Festival in Birmingham next week, has long been an outspoken critic of what he sees as the politicisation of science. The geneticist, who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology in 2001, has previously criticised US politicians for opposing the teaching of natural selection in schools. Sir Paul Nurse criticised Lord Lawson's Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF), a climate-sceptic think tank. 'We have to be aware and beware organisations that pretend to talk about science but masquerade as lobby groups,' he said/ . 'You see that a lot with climate groups, they have been some recent news in the last day or so about the funding of some of these organisations.' Lord Lawson has refused to name funders of his think tank since it was formed in 2009, explaining that they may be vilified by environmentalists. On Tuesday the Guardian newspaper publicly outed two 'secret' donors who have supported the foundation. The names were uncovered by the investigative blog Desmog UK. Neil Record, the founding chairman of a currency management company Record and an confirmed he has given money to the GWPF but said the amount was a “private matter”. Record gave the IEA £36,000 to support a seminar featuring Lawson in November 2009. Lord Nigel Vinson, a wealthy industrialist and life vice-president of the IEA, has given the GWPF £15,000 according to Charity Commission records. Sir Paul said yesterday: 'Scientists should think hard about our relationship with politicians. We should not just sit on the sidelines and sneer and criticise all the time. 'We have to work on good relationships so that they feel ashamed to say some of the things they say.' The scientist also criticised Lord Lawson's Global Warming Policy Foundation, a climate-sceptic think tank. Sir Paul said: 'We have to be aware and beware organisations that pretend to talk about science but masquerade as lobby groups. 'You see that a lot with climate groups, they have been some recent news in the last day or so about the funding of some of these organisations. 'There are lobbying groups in the environmental area who are climate change denialists, and very recently some of their funders have just been revealed. Lord Lawson has refused to name funders of his think tank since it was formed in 2009, explaining that they may be vilified by environmentalists. On Tuesday the Guardian newspaper publicly outed two 'secret' donors who have supported the foundation. Lord Lawson – who describes himself as a 'climate realist' has said his think-tank is 'open-minded on the contested science of global warming', but remains 'deeply concerned' about the costs of policies proposed in the quest to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Sir Paul added: 'We need to be aware of those who mix up science, based on evidence and rationality, with politics and ideology, where opinion, rhetoric and tradition hold more sway. We need to be aware of political or ideological lobbyists who do not respect science, cherry picking data or argument, to support their pre-determined positions.' Owen Paterson, who was sacked by David Cameron in July, has said he believes the negative impact of global warming has been exaggerated - to the exasperation of climate scientists . Mr Paterson, who is to deliver the Global Warming Policy Foundation annual lecture next month, left his cabinet position with a rant at the power of environmental pressure groups. He said he had grave misgivings about the influence of 'the Green Blob', adding: 'By this I mean the mutually supportive network of environmental pressure groups, renewable energy companies and some public officials who keep each other well supplied with lavish funds, scare stories and green tape.' Dr Benny Peiser, director of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, accused Sir Paul of using 'the language of extremism'. 'If he can't live with critics and sceptics that is too bad. But there is no need to use this kind of violent and aggressive vocabulary. 'Scepticism used to be a sign of science itself. When scientists cannot cope with that, and instead use this language of extremism, it is a sign of desperation, a sign they are losing the plot.'","Comments were made by new British Science Association president .

"Struggling to stick to your diet? Then make sure you stock up on fruit and veg – even if you don’t eat it. Scientists have discovered that the sight and smell of healthy food can help dieters stick to their weight-loss goals. In one test people reduced their chocolate consumption by more than half if they smelt a fresh orange first. And diners who started with a salad instead of garlic bread went on to eat a smaller main course – because the sight of the lettuce reminded them about their diet. A dieter's best friend? Scientists found that dieters who ate a salad instead of garlic bread as a starter went on to eat smaller main meal even though both starters had the same calorie content . Scientists from the University of Leeds said the sight and even the smell of fruit and vegetables can lower overall food intake. The study, presented at the Annual Meeting of the Society for the Study of Ingestive Behaviour, suggests healthy foods that are associated with diets can help improve self-control. Scientists say that being exposed to fruit and vegetables helps remind a dieter of their goals . Researcher Nicola Buckland said that . when tempted by food, dieters should ‘take a few moments to focus on the . sensory properties of healthy food, such as the sight and smell of . fruit or salad vegetables’. She added: ‘Healthy food cues can provide an instant reminder to dieters. Or order a salad as a starter to help reduce intake.’ Miss Buckland also recommended . filling our fruit bowls and keeping the fridge well-stocked if we want a . bit of extra help sticking to our diet plans. Even when away from home, dieters can prompt resistance to temptation with a piece of fruit or baby carrots. Or when eating out 'order a salad as a starter to help reduce intake', said Miss Buckland. The study also found the effects of healthy food to improve dieters' self-control may be most beneficial when hungry. When participants were given a standard lunch and then offered a snack two hours later, prior exposure to fruit had no effect on intake. It suggests that diet cues may be most useful when an individual is hungry and tempted to overindulge on unhealthy food.","Researchers at University of Leeds found that those who ate a salad instead of garlic bread as a starter went on to eat smaller main meal .

"Extreme measure: Egypt's President Mohamed Mursi swore in 17 new governors, several of them Islamists . A member of the movement whose gunmen killed 58 foreigners at a temple in Luxor in 1997 was sworn in by Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi on Monday as governor of the vital tourist region. Adel Mohamed al-Khayat, who now represents the Building and Development Party, political wing of the once violent al-Gamaa al-Islamiya movement, was one of 17 new governors, several of them Islamists, who took their oaths with the president. His appointment stirred outrage in some quarters. 'No to the terrorist governor!' read one placard at a demonstration by dozens of tourism workers who protested outside the governor's office in Luxor. Khayat, then in his mid-40s, was a leader of al-Gamaa al-Islamiya in another province when, on Nov. 17, 1997, six young men from the group shot their way into the Temple of Hatshepsut in Luxor's Valley of the Queens. The attack was part of a broader campaign by the group, at that time linked to al Qaeda, to cripple tourism revenues for the government of then-president Hosni Mubarak. Of the 62 people killed in the next hour, 58 were foreign tourists, more than half of them Swiss and the rest Japanese, British, German and Colombian. The gunmen, reported to have trained at al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan, committed suicide. Al-Gamaa al-Islamiya, also implicated in the 1981 assassination of Mubarak's predecessor Anwar Sadat, renounced violence and condemned al Qaeda in ideological U-turns a decade ago. It moved into public life after the revolution in 2011 which ended Mubarak's military-backed rule. Scene of death: Khayat was a leader of al-Gamaa al-Islamiya when six young men from the group shot their way into the Temple of Hatshepsut, pictured, in Luxor's Valley of the Queens in 1997 . Tragic: Of the 62 people killed at Luxor, 58 were foreign tourists, more than half of them Swiss and the rest Japanese, British, German and Colombian. Here their coffins lie in an airport hanger waiting to be repatriated . Mursi, from the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood, last year pardoned one al-Gamaa member accused of trying to kill Mubarak. He has called for the United States to free the group's spiritual leader, Omar Abdel Rahman, who was jailed for life over a bid to blow up New York's World Trade Center in 1993. In Luxor, where tourism dropped off . sharply after the 1997 attack and has been hit again by the unrest . before and since Mubarak's fall, some of the protesters expressed . concern that radical Islam could cause even further damage. Sympathy: Mursi has called for the United States to free the group's spiritual leader, Omar Abdel Rahman, who was jailed for life over a bid to blow up New York's World Trade Center in 1993 . The new governor's party has called for a ban on alcohol and night clubs and wants visitors to cover up and not wear skimpy clothing. 'Doesn't the president know that the people of Luxor depend on tourism for their livelihoods?' said one of the demonstrators, Abubaker Fadel. Protesters said they hoped to prevent Khayat from entering his office when he returned from his swearing-in ceremony in Cairo. Khayat himself was quoted in one Egyptian newspaper on Monday as saying he would welcome 'all forms of tourism'. Historian . Khaled Fahmy at the American University in Cairo said that the . appointment was the latest proof of a 'short-sighted approach' by Mursi . and his Muslim Brotherhood, a major Islamist movement that foreswore . violence in the 1970s. 'It's . as if the Muslim Brotherhood is reaching out to the extremists,' Fahmy . said. He noted tension was building ahead of planned mass demonstrations . by the opposition and Islamists to mark the first anniversary of . Mursi's taking office on June 30. Mursi's . supporters defended the choice of Khayat, saying al-Gamaa al-Islamiya . had been successful in cracking down on crime in the south, where it is . well established in the local tribal system. 'We . see they are the most capable of guarding security in these type of . provinces,' said Mostafa Elgheinemy of the Muslim Brotherhood's . executive, calling Khayat's appointment an 'excellent choice'. 'It . is impossible to exclude a faction, even if its history is bad, as long . as they have rid themselves of these ideas,' he told Reuters. 'I must . open the door for them and welcome them.'","Adel Mohamed al-Khayat swore oath to Egyptian president Mohamed Mursi .

"Rudy Giuliani turned an MSNBC segment about racially proportionate police forces in the wake of Ferguson into a soapbox for his thoughts on black-on-black crime. The former mayor appeared on Meet the Press on Sunday to address a debate about disproportionately white police forces in predominately black cities like Ferguson. Giuliani must believe there is value in making police forces representative of the population, stating it was a goal not only of his administration but of all New York mayors since Ed Koch. Sound off: Rudy Giuliani appeared on Meet the Press and turned a segment about racially proportionate police forces in the wake of Ferguson to say white cops wouldn't be needed 'if you weren't killing each other' 'We've tried to make the police force of New York City as proportionate as we possibly can. We go out of our way to do that. I think we do a pretty good job, not a perfect job.' He quickly diverted from that subject, arguing with MSNBC contributor and Georgetown professor Michael Eric Dyson about black crime. 'I find it very disappointing that you're not discussing the fact that 93 percent of blacks in America are killed by other blacks,' said Giuliani. Giuliani did not mention the source used, though a study from the Bureau of Justice Statistics found in reported crimes from 2005, 93 percent of black murder victims were killed by someone black. The study also found in the same year that 85 percent of white murder victims died at the hands of a white person. Dyson pushed back against Giuliani, calling the link made by the mayor a 'false equivalency.' 'First of all, most black people who commit crimes against other black people go to jail,' Dyson said. Back and forth: On a segment about racially proportionate police, Giuliani first stated he worked to keep a balanced force, then later argued in favor of more white cops in black neighborhoods . 'Number two, they are not sworn by the police department as agents of the state to uphold the law,' he added. Giuliani took off his glasses and cut in to argue  for more police in black neighborhoods as Dyson questioned officers' ability to effectively police those communities. 'The police presence cannot make a distinction between those who are criminals and those who call the police to stop the criminals,' he stated. The segment eventually turned into both talking over each other while Anthony Gray, attorney for Michael Brown's family, sat silent, before Giuliani capped his rant. 'Why don’t you cut it down so so many white police officers don’t have to be in black areas?' Giuliani shouted. 'The white police officers wouldn’t be there if you weren’t killing each other.'","The former New York mayor was on Meet the Press to talk about racially proportionate police forces .

"Gordon Brown warned yesterday that Scotland could be ‘lost by mistake’  as the battle against independence was being run  so ineptly. His explosive intervention, on a rare visit to Westminster, plunged the pro-Union  campaign into turmoil. The former Prime Minister hit out at the negative tactics of David Cameron, George Osborne and the cross-party Better Together campaign run by his  former Cabinet colleagues Alistair Darling and Douglas Alexander. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown said he had been motivated to join the fight against independence for the sake of his children, and his children's children . Mr Brown warned that ‘patronising’ lectures about the pound and Scotland’s EU membership risked driving . voters into the hands of the Nationalists. He suggested it had been ‘very stupid’ not to make a more positive case for staying in the Union. Mr Brown went on to urge Mr Cameron to accept the challenge of a TV debate against Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond. Under attack: A Lego character in the pro-Union advert criticised by Mr Brown . The suggestion irritated Downing Street, which views the prospect as a poisoned chalice. Mr Brown’s comments 100 days before the historic vote on September 18 also prompted a backlash from some senior Labour figures. ‘Everything has to be done Gordon’s way or he tries to dismantle it,’ one source said. Speaking . at a lunch for journalists, Mr Brown suggested he had come out of . self-imposed exile on national politics because of fears the  campaign . to prevent the break-up of the UK is going off the rails. He . singled out Mr Osborne’s decision to rule out a deal to share the pound . and Defence Secretary Philip Hammond’s warnings of major defence job . losses as errors. Mr Brown . was also scathing about the use of Lego figures last week to illustrate . the claim that Scottish voters would be £1,400 a year better off by . rejecting independence, with references to fish and chip suppers and . pies at football matches. Mr Brown has rarely ventured into British politics since leaving Downing Street in May 2010 with his wife Sarah and sons John and James in the wake of Labour's general election defeat . Labour did not spend too much and did not allow in too many immigrants, Gordon Brown insisted yesterday. The former premier hit back at critics of his record, blaming the economic crash on private sector greed not lavish public spending. Mr Brown also took a swipe at Ed Miliband, suggesting the Labour leader was wrong to apologise in 2012 for the last  government’s open-door policy on immigration. The party left a £150billion budget deficit in 2010. But Mr Brown said criticism of his government’s spending was unfair, pointing to the huge drop in tax revenues in the crisis which pushed up the public debt. He also insisted global change, not immigration, was the major issue driving support for Ukip. ‘It’s about how we respond, and who gets the benefit from these massive changes, this juggernaut that is taking place as a result of the opening up of the global economy,’ said Mr Brown. ‘Now, . countries can be lost by mistake,’ he said. ‘And if people come up to . Scotland, and say “Britain says no to Scotland having a share in the . currency”, Britain says “you are not going to have defence jobs” or . Britain says “you have got to go bankrupt” or last week, Britain says . “vote independence you will lose your fish and chips, pies and you’ll . lose your holidays in Torremolinos” in a  patronising way that ought to . be withdrawn immediately… . ‘Then . the issue will become Scotland versus Britain. And people will say the . debate is do you stand up for Britain or are you for Scotland?’ Mr Brown also issued a wider warning that pressure for devolution within England will grow. He . said the debate in Scotland was ‘changing Britain for good’. Notions of . a unitary state and Westminster sovereignty were ‘dead and buried’. Mr . Brown said: ‘I can see years of constitutional change on the agenda if . someone doesn’t grasp the nettle here and say “look we have got to think . about what holds us together as Britain”.’ He . suggested that the Better Together campaign should have made the debate . about ‘two visions of Scotland’s future’. He went on: ‘One is what I . call a patriotic vision, that’s the one I support – we have our . Parliament, our strong sense of nationhood, our own institutions, more . powers, but we don’t break every link with Britain. ‘Or . the other one, which says every link is broken.’ This included . pensions, health funding, the BBC and the Armed Forces, he warned. The . SNP was delighted by Mr Brown’s call for Mr Cameron to agree to a TV . debate with Mr Salmond. But Downing Street yesterday insisted that Mr . Salmond should face Mr Darling.","Former Prime Minister reveals his fear for the future of the country he loves .

"It started with restaurants and supermarkets - now top British universities have admitted serving up Halal meat to unwitting students. At least ten top higher education establishments - including Oxford University and the University of Manchester - are secretly serving up meat from potentially unstunned animals, it has emerged. In Manchester, 85 per cent of all meat served is unlabelled Halal meal, while all the chicken served at Sheffield and Exeter - which is Halal - is not marked as so. Ten British universities are selling Halal meat, where animals are not stunned before they are slaughtered - without telling consumers. Pictured, chickens after ritual slaughter in a Halal abattoir in Burgundy, France . The findings were unearthed through a Freedom of Information request which was sent to 126 establisments. But just 25 responded - meaning the problem could be more widespread than currently thought. The news comes after it was revealed last week that leading restaurants were serving Halal meat without informing their customers. Halal meat comes from animals which have had their cuts slit while still alive, in accordance with Islamic traditions. But some animals are not stunned beforehand, leaving them in pain. Now - according to student newspaper The Tab - nearly half of the universities that responded to the request are serving Halal meat without making students aware. Christ Church, Oxford University - one of the top universities which has admitted serving up Halal meat on the quiet . At Kent University, 70 per cent of the meat served is unlabelled Halal while at Sheffield and Exeter, all the chicken is served Halal-style, but is not labelled as so. Cardiff and . Lincoln were also found to be among the universities serving significant quantities of the . meat, without telling consumers. Of the 35 Oxbridge colleges that responded to the Freedom of Information Act request, only two did not serve any Halal meat, according to the paper. Oxford University . University of Manchester . Cardiff University . University of Sheffield . University of Exeter . Durham University . University of Lincoln . University of Kent . Northumbria University . Birmingham University . And when the suppliers were contacted to see if they supplied stunned or unstunned meat, many suppliers did not know. A spokesman for meat supplier 3663, which serves Kent and Northumbria, said: 'Currently, we do not collect information on the method of slaughter.' Fears over the correct labelling of Halal meat came to light earlier this month when it was revealed several leading chains were serving the meat to unsuspecting customers. Subway . was one leading chain which had decided to secretly swap meat for Halal products, while . Pizza Express was exposed for failing to inform consumers that some food . they were purchasing contained Halal. It . was also revealed that leading supermarkets are selling New Zealand . lamb killed in accordance with halal ritual without providing labels. The RSPCA condemned this method of non-stunned slaughter and the unethical practice of non-labelling being carried out at several UK universities. A spokesperson said: 'Scientific research has clearly shown that slaughter of an animal without stunning can cause unnecessary suffering, and so we are opposed to the slaughter of any animal without first making it insensible to pain and distress.' 'Our concern has nothing to do with the expression of religious belief but with the practice of killing by throat cutting without pre-stunning. Universities should only be serving meat that is stunned prior to slaughter. 'We are calling for labelling to refer to stun or non-stun slaughter rather than a method of ‘religious’ slaughter.' 85 per cent of the meat served at the University of Manchester was unlabelled Halal meat, according to the Freedom of Information Act requests . This call for change in current legislation is being championed by the British Veterinary Association. President Robin Hargreaves said: 'British Veterinary Association is campaigning for an end to the practice of non-stun slaughter which compromises animal welfare at the time of death. 'We would like to see all universities taking a proactive approach on animal welfare and only sourcing their meat from abattoirs that pre-stun before slaughter.' Alex McGhee, President of the Association of Veterinary Students, said: 'The fact that students are consuming non-stun meat without their knowledge is appalling. 'While non-stun slaughter continues it is absolutely imperative for students to be able to make choices based on both religious and animal welfare grounds.' Cardiff University is one of the ten universities which admitted secretly serving Halal meat to their customers. The news comes after it emerged some supermarkets and restaurants were not labelling their Halal meat . A spokesman for Northumbria University said: 'We work closely with all of our suppliers to source high-quality ingredients to serve our customers. 'There . is no legal requirement for Halal meat to be labelled. However, two of . our suppliers - Ginsters and Urban Eat - label all products where they . contain Halal meat ingredients. 'We continue to work with our suppliers to make all labelling as clear and informative as possible for our customers.' A University of Manchester spokesman said: 'The university uses a well-established local catering butcher and a large UK-based catering company to supply its meat and food products containing meat. 'The proportion of Halal meat served on campus is indicative of how the animal was slaughtered but we only label products as Halal if they have been transported, stored and prepared according to Islamic dietary laws. 'There is no national certification scheme for Halal and meat slaughtered in a way that complies with Islamic dietary laws is consumed widely across the UK. For example, chicken used in packaged sandwiches is commonly slaughtered according to Halal standards, as often is New Zealand lamb.' The Halal meat market in the UK is worth around £2.6billion per year and is still expected to soar . The Halal meat market in the UK is worth around £2.6billion a year – and it is expected to soar. Earlier this month, it was revealed that Subway has removed ham and bacon from almost 200 fast food outlets and switched to Halal meat alternatives in an attempt to please its Muslim customers. Turkey ‘ham’ and turkey rashers will be used instead in 185 of its stores, where all the meat will now be prepared according to Halal rules. The chain, which has around 1,500 outlets across the UK, explained its decision by saying it had to balance animal welfare concerns with ‘the views of  religious communities’. Traditional Halal slaughter has animals having their throats slit before bleeding to death. In Arabic the word Halal means ‘permitted’ or ‘lawful’ and defines anything that is allowed or lawful according to the Koran. It is often used to indicate food – particularly meat – that has been prepared in accordance with Muslim principles and techniques. In Britain, killing an animal without prior stunning is illegal, but the law gives special exemption to Muslim and Jewish meat producers on the grounds of religion. In the UK there are thought to be around 12 abattoirs dedicated to unstunned slaughter, while hundreds practise stunned halal slaughter. Muslims are forbidden from eating any non-Halal food and meat from pigs and Subway said customers can identify those stores selling halal food by the special ‘All meats are Halal’ sign, which must be displayed in participating branches. Halal refers to any object or action which is 'permissible' according to Islamic law. The term covers not only food and drink but also matters of daily life. Halal foods are those that Muslims are allowed to eat or drink under Islamic Shari'ah. The criteria dictates both food which are allowed and how the food must be prepared. The foods most commonly addressed are types of meat and animal tissue. The most common example of non-halal, or forbidden food is pork. It is the only meat that must not be eaten by Muslims at all, due to historical, cultural and religiously perceived hygienic concerns. Other meats can be forbidden, depending on their source, the cause of the animal's death and how it was processed. To be halal, the food must have come from a supplier that uses halal practises. Specifically the slaughter must be performed by a Muslim, who must invoke the name of Allah prior to killing the animal. Commonly a person will say 'Bismillah' ('In the name of God') before repeating 'Allahu akbar' ('God is the greatest') three times. The animal is then slaughtered with a sharp knife, by cutting the throat, windpipe and blood vessels in the neck without cutting the spinal cord. The blood must then be drained from its veins. Traditionally and according to Islamic scholars, an animal must be conscious while slaughtered. However the majority of halal abattoirs stun the animals before killing them. Muslims must also ensure that all foods, particularly processed foods, as well as non-food items like cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, are halal. The opposite of halal is 'haraam', meaning forbidden.","Ten top universities are selling unlabelled Halal meat to students .

"Archaeologists have uncovered the remains of a Thracian carriage and two horses that appear to have been buried upright. The chariot and horse skeletons are 2,500-years-old and were discovered in the village of Svestari in north-east Bulgaria. The two-wheeled carriage and carcasses of the horses were found in a Thracian tomb along with some decorations. Archaeologists have uncovered the remains of a Thracian carriage and two horses that appear to have been buried upright . Professor Diana Gergova of the National Archaeology Institute at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, who led the dig, said: 'The find is unique, it is not resembling any other carriage dating from the Thracian era ever uncovered in Bulgaria.' According to Sofia News Agency, the discovery of the carriage was unexpected as treasure hunters have plundered many of the ancient mounds found in the region in a bid to find gold, despite a UNESCO ban of this activity. The particular mound where the carriage was discovered, is adjacent to the well known Mound of Bulgarian Khan Imurtag, where the same research team uncovered a hoard of gold last year. The chariot and horse skeletons are 2,500-years-old and were discovered in the village of Svestari in north-east Bulgaria . A Roman chariot complete with a seat and boot was unearthed along with two buried horses in the village of Borissvovo in Bulgaria in 2010, which shows similarities to the new find, despite being younger in age. It was thought to belong to Thracian nobility living in the second half of the 1st century AD, judging by the imported goods found in nearby graves. The burial mount yielded seven burial structures and two pits, one of which held the carriage and horses, HorseTalk revealed. It is possible to see metal decorations (now discoloured green) that would probably have been on the horses' harnesses. This might suggest they were put into a narrow pit alive, pulling the carriage before they were killed . According to Sofia News Agency, the discovery of the carriage and horses (pictured) was unexpected as treasure hunters have plundered many of the ancient mounds found in the region in a bid to find gold, despite a UNESCO ban of this activity . Experts believe the chariot was placed in a narrow hole with a sloping side to allow horses, decorated with elaborate harnesses, to pull it into its final resting place, after which they were killed. The evidence of small metal disks on the horses' heads at the new sight, suggest they too were wearing harnesses. The Borissovo chariot was supported by stones in order to keep it in its final position and offers researchers the chance to see how the vehicles were put together, including a 'boot' which held a bronze pan and ladle, grill and bottles. A skeleton of a dog chained to the cart was also discovered, and nearby the grave of the warrior who is presumed to have owned the carriage, complete with his armour, spears and swords as well as medication and an inkwell, signifying he was well educated. Archaeologist Veselin Ignatov, who was involved in the discoveryry of another the chariot near the southeastern village of Karanovo, said around 10,000 Thracian mounds - part of them covering monumental stone tombs - are scattered across the country. Mr . Ignatov said up to 90 per cent of the tombs in the region have been . completely or partially destroyed by treasure hunters who smuggle the . most precious objects abroad.

"A former CBS reporter claims that a 'government-related agency' hacked her laptop and planted spyware and classified documents in a new book. Sharyl Attkisson, who was with CBS, says an outside source with a government agency confirmed the breach and discovered the documents hidden in her computer. The New York Post reports that an 'otherwise innocuous email' landed in Attkisson's inbox in early 2012 that was loaded with spyware. Scroll down for video . Stonewalled: Ex-CBS reporter Sharyl Attkisson says that she encountered obstacles from the Obama administration and her own colleagues while reporting . She made the discovery after she later met with an unnamed source at a McDonald's, who was 'connected to government three-letter agencies,' and passed off the computer. She claims the second time she met her source, he gave her a run down of everything the government had planted on her computer, including keylogging software. 'The intruders discovered my Skype account handle, stole the password, activated the audio, and made heavy use of it, presumably as a listening tool,' she writes in her book. 'This is outrageous. Worse than anything Nixon ever did. I wouldn’t have believed something like this could happen in the United States of America,' she says the source told her. Worse, and in some ways stranger, she claims the source found three classified documents 'buried deep' her operating system where most users would not have known to access. 'They probably planted them to be able to accuse you of having classified documents if they ever needed to do that at some point,' the source said, according to Attkisson. Novel: Her revelations claim to show there is a liberal bias in the news media as a whole that excuses the Obama administration . CBS had confirmed that Attkisson's laptop was hacked back in 2013, when it announced an unnamed cybersecurity firm had conducted a forensic analysis of the computer. 'Attkisson's computer was accessed by an unauthorized, external, unknown party on multiple occasions in late 2012,' the network said. 'While no malicious code was found, forensic analysis revealed an intruder had executed commands that appeared to involve search and exfiltration of data.' 'This party also used sophisticated methods to remove all possible indications of unauthorized activity, and alter system times to cause further confusion,' the announcement stated. The reporter also claimed to have recorded video of documents being edited in front of her eyes, but this is the first time anyone involved has tied the breach to a specific individual or entity. Attkisson, who is now senior independent contributor for The Daily Signal, a media channel for conservative think tank Heritage Foundation, frames her book around this hacking attempt. In it, she also says that her employer, CBS News, would kill stories or direct her away from lines of reporting critical of the Obama administration. Attkisson writes a colleague told her that one executive wanted stories about failing green energy companies on the CBS Evening News, but then-executive producer Pat Shevlin did not agree. When told that the stories would be 'pretty significant,' Shevlin retorted, 'What’s the matter, don’t you support green energy?' Atkisson also claims one of her superiors made it a rule to explicitly label conservatives as such, but that liberals and left-wing analysts were not called out. Apparently saving the details for the book, Attkisson says a conservative analyst who was far afield of her boss's personal views would be labeled 'right wing' in scripts. Another issue Attkisson points out is that CBS President David Rhodes has a glaring conflict of interest with the Obama administration, as his brother Ben is Deputy National Security Adviser for Strategic Communications. Nasty emails to Ben and David would apparently be sent when the network aired something distasteful to the administration, according to Attkisson. CBS reporters have still gone after the Obama administration in the past — a 60 Minutes report from Lara Logan about the unpreparedness of consular security in Benghazi retracted after its primary source was determined to be a fraud. For Attkisson though, the digging was too little too late, and she left the network in 2014, unsatisfied with what she saw as liberal excuses for the administration's actions.","Sharyl Attkisson claimed that her laptop was breached in 2012 .

"When a five-year-old boy began wearing skirts and dresses, he was often mocked or stared at by schoolmates and strangers. So his father decided there was only one solution - to start cross-dressing too, as a show of support. The family live in a small, traditional town in southern Germany, but Nils Pickert claims his radical decision has given his son confidence in his choice. All dressed up: Nils Pickert claims his example has allowed his son to feel confident in his choice to wear women's clothing . Long skirts with elasticated waistbands 'suit me quite well anyway', Mr Pickert told German feminist magazine Emma, according to a translation by Tumblr user steegeschnoeber. The pair used to live in the well-to-do borough of Kreuzberg in cosmopolitan Berlin, where there was little or no reaction to Mr Pickert's son wearing dresses. The issue would simply spark debate among parents, he said, over whether allowing it was 'wise or ridiculous'. For open-minded Mr Pickert, it was never even a question. He would sometimes dress in a skirt or dress himself, during mild weather. When they moved to a 'very traditional, very religious' little town, however, Mr Pickert's son became too embarrassed to wear women's clothing to nursery school - and asked his father if he would dress up again. 'I didn’t want to talk my son into not wearing dresses and skirts,' said Mr Pickert. 'I had only one option left: To broaden my . shoulders for my little buddy and dress in a skirt myself. Liberal: Mr Pickert claims that when the family lived in the well-to-do Berlin suburb of Kreuzberg, cross-dressing was never a big issue . 'After all, . you can’t expect a child at pre-school age to have the same ability to . assert themselves as an adult completely without role model. And so I . became that role model.' 'To this very day I’m thankful for that . woman who stared at us on the street until she ran face-first into a . street light. My son was roaring with laughter, and the next day he . fished out a dress from the depth of his wardrobe. At first only for the . weekend. Later also for nursery school.' Mr Pickert says his son's choice is now a subject of conversation for the whole town - and he feels proud of his own role in that. He calls himself 'part of the minority that makes a fool of themselves from time to time, out of conviction.' He added: 'What’s the . little guy doing now? He’s painting his fingernails. He thinks it . looks pretty on my nails, too. 'He’s simply smiling, when other boys (and it’s nearly always boys) want to make fun of him and says: ""You only . don’t dare to wear skirts and dresses because your dads don’t dare to . either."" That’s how broad his own shoulders have become by now. And all . thanks to daddy in a skirt.'","The little boy became embarrassed after being teased at nursery .

"Discrimination: Joan and Robert Vanderhorst are threatening to sue American Airlines after they say they were victims of discrimination over their 16 year old son Bede who has Downs syndrome . A family have claimed they were stopped from boarding a flight because their son has Down's Syndrome and was not wanted in the first class section. Joan and Robert Vanderhorst are threatening to sue American Airlines after they say they were victims of discrimination over their 16 year old son Bede. The couple claim as they waited to board their flight back to their home near Los Angeles they were told by airline staff they were not allowed to take their seats. Airline staff allegedly told them their son was disruptive and a danger to the flight crew. But . Mrs Vanderhorst told KLTA TV that she began filming her son as he . waited in the departure lounge showing him sitting silently waiting to . board the flight at Newark, New Jersey. In the video, she can be heard sobbing and her husband expressing disbelief. 'He's behaving,' Mr Vanderhorst says. 'He's demonstrating he's not a problem.' 'Of course he's behaving. He's never not behaved,' his wife added. Mrs Vanderhorst told KLTA: 'I kept saying, ""Is this only because he has Down's Syndrome?""' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Frequent flyers: Robert and Joan Vanderhorst said that they have flown with Bede dozens of times before but they have never had an issue, and this was the first time they were flying first class . Problem: An American Airlines employee (left) confronted the family before they boarded the plane and Mrs Vanderhorst filmed the interaction to prove her son was not being disruptive (right) The . family, who have flown together dozens of times insist Bede was singled . out on this occasion as they had upgraded to the first class section. 'This . little boy had a seat in the first class area, and for some reason, . they didn't want that. That wasn't acceptable,' Joan said. Bur American Airlines claims Bede was 'excitable, running around, and not acclimated to the environment'. They also said the pilot had unsuccessfully tried to calm him down while in the waiting area. 'For the safety of the young man and the safety of others, American Airlines offered to book another flight for the family,' American Airlines spokesman Matt Miller told KTLA. Mr Vanderhorst says the family was warned their son's behavior was a concern because their first class seat was too close to the cockpit and a distraction to the pilot could cause a mid-flight emergency landing. Traveler: The boy's parents said that their son is always well behaved and does not cause trouble . Active: Bede, seen with a Spiderman impersonator (left) and when he was pulled onstage at a Journey concert (right), supposedly behaves like a four or five year old child . 'My son is no different from a 4 or 5 year-old as far as behavior,' he insisted. The Vanderhorsts claim Bede hadn't caused any trouble and instead was being discriminated against. They said the airline was in breach of her son's civil rights and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Airline personnel called airport police to intervene in the dispute and the family were re-booked on a United Airlines flight. The Vanderhorsts reached their home in Bakersfield, California, but travelled in economy and say they have not been refunded for their first class upgrade. They say they plan to sue American Airlines, and hope their experience will teach the company and people in general a valuable lesson. 'Respect each person's dignity,' Mr Vanderhorst said. 'Every one of us should be treated with equal dignity.' WATCH THE VIDEO HERE .","Family was told that their 16-year-old son with Downs syndrome was being disruptive .

"The controversial surveillance program created by the NSA to collect records of any phone calls made to or from the United States was today deemed unconstitutional by a federal judge. U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon announced on Monday that the extensive spying program likely breaks the Fourth Amendment, which is the right that protects Americans against unlawful searches and seizures. The ruling is a boost for exiled Edward Snowden who exposed details of the NSA's huge data collection program to the public earlier this year, and is now exiled in Russia. Big brother: The NSA was revealed to be keeping track of phone calls made or received by Americans both abroad and overseas . Politico broke the news that the judge's . ruling came in conjunction with a lawsuit brought to the court by a . conservative legal activist, Larry Klayman, and his client who are both . Verizon users unhappy about having their records stored by the National . Security Agency. The judge has ordered a preliminary injunction stopping the NSA from collecting Mr Klayman's and his client's information, though the ruling could reasonably be pushed to include any such individuals. 'Plaintiffs have a very significant expectation of privacy in an aggregated collection of their telephone metadata covering the last five years, and the NSA’s Bulk Telephony Metadata Program significantly intrudes on that expectation,' Justice Leon wrote in his brief. 'I have significant doubts about the efficacy of the metadata collection program as a means of conducting time-sensitive investigations in cases involving imminent threats of terrorism. 'I cannot imagine a more ‘indiscriminate’ and ‘arbitrary invasion’ than this systematic and high-tech collection and retention of personal data on virtually every single citizen for purposes of querying it and analyzing it without judicial approval.' Indefensible: Just last week, NSA director General Keith Alexander testified on Capitol Hill about how important the program was to keeping the nation safe against terrorist attacks . Judge Leon was appointed to the court by former President George W. Bush who put some of the most wide-reaching surveillance protocols into place, which in turn adds some bipartisan weight behind the ruling. The ruling comes after a continued public debate over the inherently private tactics of the nation's top spy agency. Man behind the news: The NSA's practices have been questioned since Edward Snowden released the files in June . The news about the phone collection program was initially revealed by leaker Edward Snowden, who collected files about the NSA himself while working as a consultant for the agency. He is now living in Russia and refuses to return to the US for fear of prosecution. Agency representatives have repeatedly stood by the program since it was unveiled, including director General Keith Alexander who was quizzed about it on Capitol Hill last week. General Alexander said in a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday that the number of global threats are growing - specifically in Iraq and Syria - and they pose what he called 'an unacceptable risk' to America. 'There is no other way that we know of to connect the dots... Taking these programs off the table is absolutely not the thing to do.' Alexander acknowledged the privacy concerns that have dogged the NSA since Snowden's document release and submitted that the NSA is now open to talking to technology companies for a better solution without compromising security. 'It's like holding onto a hornet's nest. We’re getting stung,' Alexander said. But, 'if we let this down I think we will have let the nation down,' he said.","Lawsuit argued it was illegal for the NSA to collect the phone records of a conservative lawyer and his client .

"It's the website that is allowing people to rest easy (or cause them even more sleepless nights!) by pinpointing which houses were the site of an American horror story. One year in the making, DiedInHouse.com is a new means of finding out if someone died in your home. CEO Roy Condrey said he was inspired to create the site after a tenant renting a property of his in Columbia, South Carolina, informed him the place was inhabited by ghosts. Under the impression there were laws in place to disclose a death in a residence, Condrey was shocked to find there weren't any. Predominant US state laws only require the disclosure of violent deaths. While the site is benefitting those who . have long held the belief their house was haunted by pulling up . relevant historical information, it is proving even more advantageous to . homeowners or potential buyers. Freaky: A new website is helping people - and putting off real estate agents - by providing information on whether someone has died inside a residence . It's much harder to sell a house at a premium price when a buyer knows something grisly has unfolded inside. 'It occurred to me that a service which told people who died in their homes before they moved in would be popular,' Condrey told the Houston Chronicle. 'It's harder to find things like this out than you think.' Texas, for example, is a non-disclosure state. 'Per the Texas Association of Realtors Seller’s Disclosure form it is not a requirement to disclose a non-violent death that occurred on the property,' said Houston real estate agent Danelle Reed. 'However, a violent death — like a murder — must be disclosed.' According to Condrey, since sending the site live on June 1, he has had the most hits from people in Texas and California. California residents, he says, are interested in the many famous murders and deaths in the state and the possibility that one may be linked to their house. It costs $11.99 to submit a request. Once a user logs on and enters an address, Condrey and his team of staff search through a multitude of sources to deliver information on previous owners and whether or not anyone met their demise inside the residence. The site: DiedInHouse.com claims to have processed thousands of requests since launching on June 1. Many of the submissions are from either Texas or California . Some realtors are actively against DiedInHouse.com because it costs them money on what is known as 'stigmatized' properties. However Condrey maintains he is providing a legitimate public service. One case might have been the story of Janet Milliken, who moved to Pensylvania with her two children from California following the death of her husband. She bought a house for $610,000 but would later find out it was the site of a recent murder-suicide. Still trying to deal with her own tragedy, Miliken was faced with also dealing with the people who would come by to gawk at her new home. Milliken sued for fraud and misrepresentation, claiming the owners and real estate agents duped her. However the judge ruled against her, saying Pennsylvania state law does not require agents to disclose such events to buyers. She’s since appealed to the state Supreme Court. Contentious: Widow Janet Milliken lost out in court in her attempt to prove she was duped into buying this Pennsylvania house. Mrs Milliken bought the home after her husband died and was not told it was the site of a murder-suicide less than two years earlier. While still trying to deal with her own tragedy she was faced with people coming by the property to gawk . The stigma of a death in a home, especially a violent killing, is a powerful one, especially for families. 'It would bother me if I knew someone died in my house,' Condrey said. 'For instance, I couldn’t live in a house where there was a murder-suicide.' A quiet death, Condrey says, would be easier for some to deal with . Thousands of requests have been serviced since the site's launch, Condrey said. Even realtors are using the site to better familiarize themselves with a client's property. 'Some people don’t have a problem with knowing someone died in their home,' says Condrey. 'But when you remind them that this knowledge could affect their home values, they change their tune.'","DiedInHouse.com uses a multitude of sources to tell users whether anyone has died in their house .

"A woman has been sensationally arrested in Florida over the death of her five-year-old son on what would have been his 29th birthday. Timothy Wiltsey went missing at a carnival at Kennedy Park in New Jersey in May of 1991, sparking a nationwide search. His partial remains were discovered in April the following year at Raritan Center, an industrial site at Edison, New Jersey. Scroll down for video . Michelle Lodzinski (left) has been arrested and charged with murder more than 20 years after her son, Timothy Wiltsey (right) went missing at a carnival in New Jersey . More than 20 years later, police have arrested his mother Michelle Lodzinski at an address in Jensen Beach, Florida, following a routine review of the cold case. According to reports at the time, Lodzinski, 47, took her son to a carnival in 1991 and allowed her son to ride on some of the attractions. At the time, it was reported that he asked for a drink and after she turned her back, he had disappeared. The carnival was closed down while a frantic search took place, but he could not be found. In the days that followed his desperate relatives and family friends organised several searches in the South Amboy area. As the appeal for information intensified, thousands of rail workers were handed flyers while his face was shown on big screens at major sporting fixtures. But police became suspicious after no one at the carnival saw a youngster matching Timothy's description. More than two decades later, a grand jury in Middlesex County has indicted her on a first-degree murder charge. Lodzinski . was arrested Wednesday evening around 6 p.m in Jensen Beach, Florida . after leaving work at the law firm, according to Master Sgt. Frank . Sabol, a Port St. Lucie police spokesman. Lodzinski . was in her car and headed over to her sister's house in Jensen Beach . when she was pulled over and detained. 'She was arrested without . incident,' Sabol said. 'She didn't put up a struggle.' A . New Jersey prosecutor said in a statement that the new information that . led to her arrest arose out of a cold case review of the boy's unsolved . 1991 disappearance. 'Following . a routine, cold case review of the evidence and facts surrounding the . disappearance and murder of Timothy Wiltsey, a new investigation was . conducted and the matter was presented to the grand jury,' Middlesex . County Prosecutor Andrew C. Carey said in a statement released Thursday. The . grand jury charged that Lodzinski “did purposely or knowingly kill . Timothy Wiltsey, or did purposely or knowingly inflict serious bodily . injury upon Timothy Wiltsey, resulting in his death…,' according to . Carey. Sabol . said that Port St. Lucie police have been assisting New Jersey . prosecutors on the case since at least 2012 - sitting in on witness . interviews, executing search warrants and navigating the local court . system, but declined to divulge further details. Lodzinski, . who lives with two other sons, 12 and 16, in Port St. Lucie, 'hadn't . been on our radar until a couple years ago, when we were contacted by . New Jersey [prosecutors],' Sabol said. 'I checked our [St. Lucie County] jail records and we are not coming up with anything for her in this county,' he said. Her . bail was set at $2million though and it is not yet clear whether she . will waive an extradition hearing and return to New Jersey. Fellow employees at a civil litigation firm where Lodzinski works were 'stunned' to learn of her arrest. 'Everybody . here was certainly surprised, stunned and saddened,' said an employee . of GARY, WILLIAMS, PARENTI, WATSON & GARY, P.L, who requested . anonymity in return for speaking freely. 'The shocking thing is that her two sons are just these amazing, lovely children. She was a proud, doting mom to them,' the source said, adding that the two boys had occasionally visited their mother at work. 'Who would have ever known...' the source said, before going silent for a moment. 'Unbelievable.' The firm handles civil litigation, including medical malpractice, personal injury and wrongful death cases. 'We . had no knowledge of any of this,' the source told MailOnline on . Thursday morning. 'She came to work every day, but we had really no . knowledge of any other - certainly of this particular incident - but in . any other incidents that she was involved in.' Police arrested Michelle Lodzinski at an address in Jensen Beach, Florida, following a routine review of the cold case involving the death of her son . A grand jury in Middlesex County has indicted Michelle Lodzinski on a first-degree murder charge . The colleague said Lodzinski never made mention of her missing son, or her 1995 guilty plea after claiming the previous year that she herself was abducted by FBI agents. Lodzinski also pled guilty in 1998 to stealing a former employer's computer. 'She does have two kids, I know, in Port St. Lucie,' the colleague said, but Lodzinski divulged very little at work about her personal life. Kori Searcy, spokeswoman for the law firm, said Lodzinski has long been a member of the Stuart, Florida legal community, and has worked for at least three other area law firms since the mid-1990s. Retired New Jersey judge Alan A. Rockoff, who was Middlesex County Prosecutor in 1991, said the disappearance was a heartbreaking unsolved case that has been 'bugging' him for years. 'It’s gratifying to know that you’re suspicions were warranted in cases like this,' he said on Thursday. 'You grow a tough skin in law enforcement work, and I’ve been doing it for a lot of years, not only as prosecutor but a criminal judge. 'But when you have a young child with a face like Timmy Wiltsey,' he said, sighing deeply, 'you can never forget it.' Rockoff said that despite suspicions, investigators could not nail down sufficient evidence for an arrest back in 1991. 'There were several factors that more than satisfied us that we were looking at the right suspect,' Rockoff said. 'Her inconsistencies [in her story], some of the actual observations that were made [by investigators], some of her associations and the fact that some of the associates wouldn’t talk to us – all made us confident we were moving in the right direction.' 'Acknowledging the presumption of innocence and the state’s burden to prove beyond reasonable doubt, it’s a step in the right direction. I’m pleased that this case wasn’t put in a back shelf to gather dust.' He declined to speculate on what evidence may have prompted Lodzinski’s arrest.

"A mystery cat-like creature has been filmed stalking the streets of Los Angeles at night, prompting fears an African lion may be on the loose. Grainy security camera footage taken by a City of Norwalk resident shows the unidentified beast wandering past houses and parked cars under the cover of darkness on July 29. At first glance the creature, which ambles slowly and calmly past the security camera, appears to be an African lioness or mountain lion. Scroll down for video . This still shot from the video shows the creature wandering past houses in urban Norwalk, Los Angeles . Experts have struggled to agree on what it is, suggesting it's an African lion, a mountain lion or even a big dog . City police and sheriff patrols have been increased in the area in order to reduce residents' safety concerns . But speculation over what animal it could be is now rife, with claims and counter claims being made by a variety of officials and experts. They have suggested it is - among other things - a mountain lion, an African lion, some type of hybrid dog, a leopard or a large domestic cat. Some have even speculated it could be the mythical Chupacabra. There have been no further sightings of the creature since the video was recorded and City of Norwalk officials said it was not believed to be a hoax. While the Department of Fish and Wildlife has ruled out the possibility the creature is a mountain lion, it has admitted it still can't definitively identify it. The creature was filmed walking across a driveway on Tina Street (pictured), in the City of Norwalk, LA . Meanwhile, police patrols have been increased in the area and residents are being educated on what to do if they spot it. Craig Packer, a professor at the University of Minnesota Lion Research Centre, told The LA Times: 'Yes, it certainly does look like an African lion. It’s not a cougar.'

"Hidden within the City Records Center in downtown Los Angeles - a vast repository that stores 150 years of city documents - lies the LAPD Archives. A collection of an estimated one million photographs, the archive dates back as early as 1925 and varies from forensic shots of bank robbery notes through to morgue portraits, crime scene images and crime re-enactment stills, The Art Newspaper reported. The center contains boxes upon boxes of decomposing, chemically unstable negatives, many of which are from the Special Investigations Division, America's oldest crime lab. LA-based photographer and LAPD reserve officer Merrick Morton learned of the archive in 2001 when researching a photo exhibition he was doing on the history of the LAPD. For the first time ever, photos from the LAPD archives, some dating back to 1925, have been public as part of a new exhibit. Here the body of a murder victim can be seen, dated September 13, 1934 . Grisly: This photo, one of about 50 on display, is dated September 23, 1950 . A car riddled with bullets is pictured from October 10, 1942 . It looks like a still from a film, but this is a photo of some detectives at a crime re-enactment in 1963 . Chilling: A demand note taken as evidence from a bank robbery on December 21, 1961 . A detective points to a victim camouflaged in brush at a crime scene dated September 28, 1942 . After searching the Los Angeles Police Historical Society's collection and not finding what he was looking for, Morton convinced officials to grant him access to the archive. He and his wife, photography dealer Robin Blackman - who together own the gallery Fototeka -  have spent hundreds of hours sifting through envelopes filled with negatives over the last 13 years, carefully selecting the most historically significant and visually powerful images. When brought to the attention of the Fire Department, the negatives were ordered to be destroyed in bulk because of the hazard they posed to the Records Center. The couple then convinced the LAPD to  preserve the lion’s share of images, with the negatives moved to a cold storage facility in Hollywood. Images of a shooting that occurred on 7th Avenue in the Wilshire district of Los Angeles on July 19, 1950 . 'Detail of bullet holes in screen', which is dated February 3, 1930 . A female assault victim exposes her injuries on June 2, 1950 . Around 50 of the photographs the couple came across make up an incredible new exhibition for Paris Photo Los Angeles at Paramount Studios. The fair's director, Julien Frydman, said the result is a cinematic experience. 'The images remind us of film noir or even contemporary film stills, but what is represented in the photos are snapshots of real happenings, and not mise-en-scène,' he said. Scene shots of a man who committed suicide on September 4, 1950 . A bank robbery note from March 11, 1965 . Body of a man in a morgue on on March 29, 1945 . Scene of a carbon monoxide poisoning on December 18, 1950 . The photos will be on display from April 25-27. Gelatin prints can be ordered at prices ranging from $325 to $700, depending on size. A portion of the proceeds will go toward further preservation of the LAPD archive. Chalk outline detailing a knife in the victim's hand dated April 12, 1950 .

The teenagers, dressed in white kits, were in good spirits having just trumped their rivals, Woodstock North, 57-48 inside the Landers Pavilion at Marian Central, which is the Class 3A regionals host.

In its apology, the school said: 'On behalf of Woodstock and the girls basketball program, we would like to apologize for our actions after the regional final girls basketball game Marian Central hosted. 'Our intent was certainly not to insult, nor denigrate, Marian Central and its family. We apologize the act could solicit a perception of disrespect to faith, one's school or the community they represent.' It added: 'The team’s symbol of “girl power” was used in an inappropriate manner. We are sincerely regretful for our actions and will use this as a learning experience for our program.'

"Relative connections: The father of Cerberus boss Stephen Feinberg (pictured) lives in Newtown, Connecticut . There is a new connection between the private equity firm Cerberus who owns the gun manufacturer that produced the rifle used by the Sandy Hook shooter. The father of Cerberus boss Stephen Feinberg lives in Newtown, Connecticut, where a Bushmaster AR-15 rifle made by Remington was used to kill 20 children and six elementary school staff. The gun used by 20-year-old Adam Lanza in the massacre on Friday is a ‘civilian’ version of the military M-16. The private equity firm, Cerberus Capital Management, announced it was selling Remington Arms Company, one of America’s largest rifle makers, as it tried to distance itself from public and political anger against  the firearms industry. Pressure mounted on the private . equity firm to get rid of its holding after the California State . Teachers' Retirement System threatened to pull the $750million it has . under Cerberus' management on Monday. The bold move comes as retail giant Walmart removed the .223-caliber Bushmaster AR-15 from its website in the wake of the devastating massacre and Dick's Sporting Goods also pulled the semi-automatic weapon and others like it from its shelves. In . a statement this morning, Cerberus said it was deeply saddened by the . shootings, adding that they were a 'watershed event' in the national . debate on gun control. Selling up: New York-based private equity firm Cerberus, pictured, is selling its stake in Freedom Group, the company that made the Bushmaster rifle Adam Lanza used to slaughter innocent children and school staff . Bushmaster: Nguyen allegedly bought the Bushmaster rifle, pictured, for William Spengler and he used it to shoot two firefighters . 'We were shocked and deeply saddened by the events that took place at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown... We cannot comprehend the losses suffered by the families and friends of . those killed by the unthinkable crimes committed that day,' the company said. 'It is apparent that the Sandy Hook . tragedy was a watershed event that has raised the national debate on gun . control to an unprecedented level. 'The debate essentially focuses on the . balance between public safety and the scope of the Constitutional . rights under the Second Amendment.' Weapons: The Bushmaster assault rifle, owned by Nancy Lanza, pictured left, but used by Adam Lanza, right, in Friday's school shooting has been pulled from shelves as Cerberus sells its stake in the  gun manufacturer . Cerberus added . that while it was not its role to attempt to shape or influence the . debate around firearms, it could take action to ensure it represented . the interests of its shareholders. 'We believe that this decision allows . us to meet our obligations to the investors whose interests we are . entrusted to protect without being drawn into the national debate that . is more properly pursued by those with the formal charter and public . responsibility to do so,' the firm said int he statement. On Friday, 26 people were killed at . Sandy Hook Elementary School in one of the worst mass shootings in U.S . history. The shooter, Lanza, used the .223-caliber Bushmaster rifle, along with two other guns, to kill his helpless victims. Cerberus . has been in the weapons game for at least six years. Respect: Chain store Dick's Sporting Goods, pictured, is pulling certain semi-automatic rifles from its shelves after the Sandy Hook school shooting . Pulling guns: Walmart, pictured, has also removed certain guns from its shelves since the shooting . The private equity firm, owned by . billionaire financier Stephen Feinberg, acquired firearms maker . Bushmaster in 2006. It later sought to consolidate the fragmented . weapons industry by snapping up at least six other gun manufacturing . brands and rolling them into one, which it named Freedom Group. Cerberus Capital Management acquired Bushmaster Firearms - the maker of Adam Lanza's deadly AR-15 rifle - in 2006. It then snapped up at least six other gun manufacturing brands and rolled them into one company, which it called Freedom Group, based in Madison, North Carolina. It is the United States' biggest gun company and is expected to post revenues of about $900 million for 2012 - perhaps boosted by the sobering sales surge over the weekend. As well as Bushmaster, brands under the Freedom umbrella include Remington Arms, which is the country's largest and oldest rifle maker, and Marlin Firearms, a manufacturer of lever-action rifles. Freedom also owns Advanced Armament, a maker of pistol silencers. According to the New York Times, foreign gun manufacturers such as Forjas Taurus of Brazil and Herstal Group of Belgium may be interested in buying up Freedom Group from Cerberus. As of a 2010 regulatory filing, Cerberus owns more than 95 per cent of Freedom Group. Freedom Group, based in Madison, North Carolina, reported net sales of . $677.3 million for the nine months ending September 2012, up from . $564.6 million in the same period a year ago. It is heading for total revenues of . around $900 million for the year, though a shocking sales spike spurred . on by Friday's shooting could inflate the already-staggering amount . further. Other brands coming under the Freedom Group umbrella include Remington Arms, which is the . country's largest and oldest rifle maker, and Marlin Firearms, a . manufacturer of lever-action rifles. Freedom also owns Advanced Armament, a maker of pistol silencers. As of a 2010 regulatory filing, Cerberus owns more than 95 per cent of Freedom Group. Cerberus said that it will hire a financial adviser to help with the process of selling its Freedom Group interests. In its statement, the New York-based company said Freedom Group does not sell weapons or ammunition directly to . consumers, and that it does not believe that 'Freedom Group or any . single company or individual can prevent senseless violence or the . illegal use or procurement of firearms and ammunition.' Cerberus . Capital Management makes investments on behalf of clients that include . the pension plans of firemen, teachers, policemen, and other municipal . workers and unions, endowments and other institutions and individuals. It has over $20 billion under management. The . California teachers' pension fund, known as CalSTRS, had around $751.4 . million invested with Cerberus at the end of March 2012, according to . its website. The hefty investment renders it one of Cerberus' largest clients. On Monday, CalSTRS announced that following the massacre it was reviewing its relationship with the firm. 'The tragic and devastating acts that took place (on) December 14 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut have prompted many in this country to call for change: To determine what we can do differently to help ensure the unthinkable never happens again,' the pension fund said in a statement. Watershed: Cerberus is selling its stake in the company that made the Bushmaster rifle used by Lanza in the shootings at the elementary school, pictured, calling it a watershed event' in the national debate on gun control . Victims: A display of wooden crosses, and a Jewish Star of David, represented the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting on Monday . 'In our case, CalSTRS investment . staff immediately began reviewing our investments in private equity . funds managed by Cerberus Capital Management.' Also on Monday, the California Treasurer Bill Lockyer raised concerns about the California Public Employees' Retirement System's investments in gun manufacturers and may order the fund's trustees to strip any holdings in gun companies in light of the massacre. Money made from the Freedom Group stake sale will be returned to its investors, Cerberus said. According to The New York Times, shares . of the publicly traded U.S. gunmakers, Sturm, Ruger & Company and . Smith & Wesson, dropped sharply over the past two days on . fears of increased gun regulation. Dick's Sporting Goods, . one of the largest sporting goods retailers in the world, has removed . all guns from its store nearest to Newtown, Connecticut, and is . suspending the sale of certain kinds of semi-automatic rifles from its . chains nationwide. Sales of assault weapons have surged across the United States since the Sandy Hook school shooting, as gun enthusiasts brace for a likely tightening of firearm laws.Thousands of Americans headed to their local gun store over the weekend, snapping up the popular AR-15 - one of the three weapons gunman Adam Lanza used to kill 28 people, including himself on Friday.Sales of the .223 ammunition used by the AR-15 also spiked as well as the type of high-capacity magazines affected under the last federal weapons ban, which was introduced in 1994 and allowed to expire.In San Diego, Northwest Armory gun store owner Karl Durkheimer told Fox News that Saturday 'was the biggest day we've seen in 20 years.'Meanwhile, the Colorado Bureau of Investigation said it processed more than 4,200 background checks on Saturday, surpassing the previous one-day record of 4,028. Lanza reportedly tried to buy a gun from . a Dick's Sporting Goods store in the city of Danbury, about 12 miles . away from Newtown, prior to the killings. The company said the reports hadn't . been confirmed but it was suspending the sale of so-called 'modern . sporting rifles' out of respect for the victims and families of the . Sandy Hook school shooting. 'We continue to extend our deepest . sympathies to those affected by this terrible tragedy,' the sports store . said in a statement, according to CNN. A search of Dick's Sporting Goods website on Tuesday morning showed a blank page for 'modern sporting rifles.' It's not clear how long Dick's will keep the suspension in place for the weapons. It . is believed to be the first time the store has taken such a stance . against guns after a U.S. shooting made worldwide headlines. 'At . this time, reports that the suspect visited one of our stores last week . have not been confirmed by law enforcement,' Dick's said. 'Based on our records, we can confirm that no firearms were . sold to the suspect identified in this case.' Meanwhile, Walmart has taken the assault-rifle model Lanza used to gun down his victims off its online store. According to the New York Post, the . rifle had been available on Walmart's website until Monday afternoon. But the listing suddenly disappeared after thenation.com reported that . scores of the frightening semi-automatic weapon were being sold through . the retail giant's site. Thenation.com said the model was available at 1,700 Walmart stores across the country. It is not clear how Lanza's gun . enthusiast mother, Nancy, got her hands on the Bushmaster rifle, a . civilian version of an assault rifle used by troops fighting in the Iraq . and Afghanistan.","New York-based company is ditching shares in Freedom Group, which manufactured the .223-calliber Bushmaster AR-15 .

"Lou Teasdale has a job that many teenagers would covet working as One Direction's personal hair and make-up artist. FEMAIL were keen to hear her beauty secrets and got the chance as she celebrated the launch of her DIY hair and beauty bible, The Craft, this week, with a little help from Harry Styles, Ed Sheeran and Liam Payne. The beauty guru revealed what trends are going to be big news this season, how you can pull them off and get the look for less at home. Beauty queen: Last night saw Lou Teasdale, pictured with good friends Harry Styles and Ed Sheeran, launch her new DIY beauty book, The Craft . Her book features step-by-step make-up and hair tutorials that are edgy, stylish and fun. From fancy fishtailing, twisting, or dip-dying your hair to creating the perfect foundation base or smokey eye, Lou has it covered. If that all sounds a bit too much, then be bold - Lou said this season is all about taking your beauty regime one step further: think bright colours, hair chalk and glitzy brows. Those of you who were too afraid to experiment with rainbow hair will be pleased to know that the more muted 'drainbow' hair is the hottest style for summer. Speaking about the trend, Lou said: 'Those cool people who live in East London were first on the scene with neon/lumo/vunge green/pink hair last year. Hot new hair trend: Lou predicts that the 'drainbow' look, where dye has begun to wash out, is going to be huge this season . Go bold or go home! Bright colours will be adorning nails, lips and even eyebrows, so will brow queen Cara Delevingne been trialling the trend? 'And when the dye started to wash out, they accidentally created a whole new look: drainbow. 'It's a much more wearable colour trend that's great for girls who don't want to go too crazy with their pretty hair.' If drainbow is too adventurous, Lou suggests accessorising and takes a 'more is more' stance. 'Just when you think you've added enough, keep going! Be creative when sourcing your bobbles, clips, beads and slides. Children's toy shops have some great trinkets and all kids' clothes shops have good accessories sections.' Thanks to the likes of Prince Harry's girlfriend Cressida Bonas, scrunchies are back in fashion - Lou says the best way to pull off the look is with a scrunchie topknot. Accessorise all areas: For those not daring enough for hair dye, try some beads, which you can pick up from children's stores . Last season saw Cara Delevingne put big brows on the beauty map, but now it's all about embellishing them with glitter and bright hues. Enter the browscara. 'All the cool kids are doing browscara,' explained Lou. 'What does it remind me of? Oh wait, remember hair mascara? That! 'Even if you're mega blonde you'll still look cooler with dark eyebrows. Trust me. You don't even need to faff around with dye. Once you've done your lashes, simply brush some mascara into your brows and done.' As for lashes, while most girls try their hardest to avoid spider eyes, Lou says that's the exact look we should now be striving to achieve. Get the look: Lou's new book outlines exactly how to achieve the on-trend messy fishtail plait and new dreadlock at home . 'Forget limp daddy-long-legs lashes. We're layering our mascara ten times because we want tarantula legs! You don't need false lashes for this look, just clump it up and lump it on with Max Factor's 2000 calorie mascara,' she said. Lou is the global brand ambassador for Fudge Urban - a collection of fun, edgy and alternative unisex hair styling products inspired by fashion, culture, music and all things creative. At her launch this week, Lou's hair stylists were testing out the season's trends and were on hand to offer chalked hair, while HD Brows gave guests glitzy brow-overs. Lou, 31, . trained at London College of Fashion and assisted for five years without a pay cheque to her name. Guru: The Craft (R) features step-by-step make-up and hair tutorials that are edgy, stylish and fun like Lou herself (L) She worked on hair counters at shopping centers and assisted hairstylists before getting her big break on X Factor and Britain's Got Talent, where she worked for five years. She now travels the world with the One Direction boys and has amassed 1.4m Twitter followers thanks to her candid beauty tips and fun photofeed - Harry Styles is partial to a few selfies with Lou and her baby daughter. Will he be sporting drainbow hair anytime soon? Most probably, if Lou has anything to do with it. Lou loves these Fudge Urban Colour Chalks (£5.99 from Superdrug.com) for creating drainbow hair . Lou Teasdale's The Craft is available on Amazon now.","Lou Teasdale unveiled The Craft at star-studded show last night .

"A Florida man who traveled to Iraq to fight ISIS with a battalion of fellow Westerners last year has been injured in the town of Sinjar. Matthew Kawolski was fighting alongside the Chappies--a unit of Westerners within the Syria-based People's Protection Units (YPG)--when he was apparently wounded in combat. Kawolski, who is among a slew of foreigners fighting ISIS in the region, is now recovering from his injuries, according to a February 9 post on a Facebook page for the foreign fighters group the Lions of Rojava. Injured in Iraq: Matthew Kawolski was fighting alongside the Chappies--a unit of Westerners within the Syria-based People's Protection Units (YPG), when he was apparently hurt in combat . Recovering: Kawolski, who is among a slew of foreigners fighting ISIS in the region, is now recovering from his injuries, according to a February 9 post on a Facebook page for the foreign fighters group the Lions of Rojava . 'His brothers are standing by him during his recovery and he will be returning to the city upon his recovery,' reads a Facebook page for the group Lions of Rojava . 'His brothers are standing by him during his recovery and he will be returning to the city upon his recovery,' reads the post. The post does not indicate the nature or extent of Kawolski's injuries. It does, however, reveal a good deed the Florida man did upon his return to Sinjar. 'He purchased and delivered a soccer ball to the Yezidi children in the UN refugee camp to display his care and concern for them. His service has been selfless and brave. Stay Chappy my friend,' reads the post. Pictured alongside Kowalski on the Lions of Rojava page is another American, one who made headlines when he left his country to serve in the fight against ISIS. Jordan Matson, a 28-year-old food packaging worker from Sturtevant, Wisconsin, is a former U.S. Army soldier who never served overseas. Wisconsin former soldier for the US Army Jordan Matson is another American serving in the fight against ISIS . International brigades: Jordan Matson, 28, right, a former U.S. Army soldier from Sturtevant, Wisconsin, takes a break with other fighters from the main Kurdish militia, the People's Protection Units, or YPG, in Sinjar, Iraq . But he has been fighting with the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) since last September. After starting his adventure in Syria, the committed Christian is now in Iraq, where he fights against the jihadis of Islamic State wearing a tactical vest scribbled with the words 'Christ is Lord'. 'I'm not going back until the fight is finished and ISIS is crippled,' Mr Matson told the Associated Press. 'I decided that if my government wasn't going to do anything to help this country, especially Kurdish people who stood by us for 10 years and helped us out while we were in this country, then I was going to do something.' Mr Matson and dozens of other Westerners now fight with the Kurds, spurred on by Kurdish social media campaigners and a sense of duty many feel after Iraq, the target of a decade-long U.S.-led military campaign, collapsed under an Islamic State group offensive within days last summer. And while U.S. and its coalition allies bomb the extremists from the air, Kurds say they hope more Westerners will join them on the ground to fight. They call themselves the Lions Of Rojava and boast: 'It is better to live one day as a Lion than a thousand days as a sheep.' They are the foreign fighters who have travelled to Syria not for jihad, but to join the Kurds who are defending their communities against the advance of ISIS. Just as hundreds of young Europeans have gone to fight for the radical Islamists of Islamic State, so increasing numbers are now travelling to fight for their avowed enemies, the Kurds. Jordan Matson, a former US soldier now with the Kurdish People's Protection Unit (YPG), operates The Lions Of Rojava Facebook page openly calling for volunteers to travel to join the fight. Just as many of the Islamic State's foreign volunteers have been drawn from the ranks of Sunni Muslim youth worldwide, many of the initial YPG volunteers have come from the Kurdish diaspora. In August a hairdresser from south London was reported to be the first Briton to travel to fight alongside Kurdish forces. Ethnic Kurd Mama Kurda from Croydon, 26, travelled to Iraq to join the Kurdish peshmerga as they desperately tried to halt Islamic State's lightning advance. Among the many Western fighters joining the Lions of Rojava in their campaign to defeat ISIS are Jamie Read from north Lanarkshire, Scotland (left) and James Hughes (right) from Reading in Berkshire . But since then many others have been inspired to take up arms against Islamic State, including fellow British soldier duo James Hughes, a 26-year-old from Malvern, Worcestershire and Jamie Read, 24, from Carlisle. Last month it was reported that a currently serving British marine had been questioned by police who suspected he was travelling to fight with Kurdish militias during his leave. The 22-year-old Royal Marine Commando was quizzed after he prepared to fly from California on a one-way ticket to Turkey. He was suspected of being in contact with Kurdish militant groups. Two women, Canadian Jew Gill Rosenberg, 31, and Danish Kurd Joanna Palani, 20, have also reportedly travelled to fight with the Kurds, inspired perhaps by the images of female fighters on the front line against Islamic State terrorists. Fighters march under the black banner of Islamic State, which is locked in battle with the YPG . It is perhaps the only place in the world where women are fighting on the front line of armed conflict. There are also claims that a number of European biker gangs have travelled to Syria and are helping to assist the resistance. Leaders of the Cologne-based Median Empire Motorcycle Club, which has strong Kurdish links, have posted images of their German riders posing in the city - some of them carrying weapons. The news came just days after three members of a notorious motorcycle gang from the Netherlands were told they had not committed any crime by travelling to Kobani to join the fight against ISIS.","Matthew Kawolski was serving with the group of foreigners Lions of Rojava in the city of Sinjar near the border with Syrian Kurdistan .

"An actor who is a regular fixture on The Young and the Restless was run down by a car and allegedly beaten while trying to get a Thanksgiving dinner to a late-working friend. Corey Sligh, 27, who plays a bartender and a waiter in the soap opera, was badly hurt Thursday while trying to get food to a friend working at a Rite Aid store in West Hollywood, California. Sligh's arm was broken and he had to be taken to hospital after a gang of drunks pulling donuts and speeding in the store parking lot lashed out when he told them to be careful. Injuries: Corey Sligh, a frequent extra on The Young and the Restless, was attacked outside a Rite Aid store in West Hollywood, California . Thugs: Two men are accused of running Sligh down then beating him after he told them to stop speeding and pulling dangerous stunts in a parking lot . Police said the men drove the car into Sligh, then got out and started beating him while he was on the ground. His girlfriend, Alisa Berhorst, saw events unfold, KCAL9 reported. The suspects have since been arrested. One was charged with assault with a deadly weapon, the other with felony assault.

What compounds Carol’s distress is that it was a routine operation to extract a wisdom tooth that left her in this state. Carol Russell, 46, from Birmingham, was left with permanent nerve damage after several operations on her wisdom teeth that left her in agony for six years. She has since received compensation from South Birmingham Primary Care Trust . During the procedure six years ago, the dentist damaged the inferior dental nerve, which provides sensation to the lip and chin. ‘It has been an absolutely horrendous time,’ says Carol. ‘I’m in pain all the time. I find eating really difficult and the worst thing is that I can’t bear contact anywhere near my face including hugging and kissing.’ That means her daughter Laura, 27, son Richard, 24, and her partner, Glenn, can’t go near her. She says: ‘I’ve been on ever-increasing doses of painkillers and none has worked. The only way I get any temporary relief is with a pain patch on my chin.’ This contains drugs that seep into the skin and block pain. ‘But it has to stay on at least 12 hours a day to have any effect.’ The problem is that wisdom teeth can lie very close to the inferior dental nerve, explains St John Crean, professor of medicine in dentistry at the University of Central Lancashire. He says damage can be avoided if ‘a decent enough X-ray is given before the procedure goes ahead’. He points out: ‘It’s not enough for a dentist to give an internal X-ray in the mouth as that only shows a small area — it needs to be a good panoramic one. Even then, if the dentist is even slightly unsure of where this nerve lies, they need to refer the patient to a specialised dental surgeon who should take a CT scan before going ahead.’ Wisdom teeth, found at the back of the mouth, are the last four teeth to come through — usually in our late teens or early 20s. There isn’t always room for them to grow, so they can emerge at an angle or only partially break through - when they are described as ‘impacted’. Food and bacteria can become trapped around the tooth, causing a build-up of plaque, and decay and infection. Problems can occur years after the teeth have erupted. Wisdom teeth extraction is one of the most common procedures carried out in the UK. In England alone, 63,000 are extracted each year in NHS hospitals . Wisdom tooth extraction is one  of the most common procedures carried out in the UK - in England alone, 63,000 are extracted each year in NHS hospitals. Yet it is a potentially complex operation, carrying the risk of nerve damage, infection and bleeding. Under guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, ‘only patients who have diseased wisdom teeth, or other problems with their mouth, should have their wisdom teeth removed’. Dentists don’t need specialist training to perform an extraction but some prefer to refer patients to a specialist oral or dental surgeon. Carol’s problems began after she suffered several minor infections in her lower right jaw over a two-and-a-half year period. Her dentist suggested a wisdom tooth was the cause and referred her to a hospital dental surgeon in October 2008. An X-ray confirmed the problem and the following month the tooth was removed. But almost immediately afterwards, it was clear something was very wrong. ‘For three days my face was a balloon, and I had this terrible pressure,’ Carol recalls. While the swelling subsided, ‘as the days went by I felt this throbbing pain building in my face and chin’. Despite repeated visits to the hospital over the next few months, Carol was told her symptoms were normal — and was given increasing doses of pain relief. ‘It was getting impossible to do anything normal and  I begged for help. I could even feel pain if I brushed cotton wool against my face. Yet all the time I was told things would be fine.’ Finally, in May 2009, she had surgery for what she was told was a damaged nerve. It left her in agony for three weeks, with a bruised and battered-looking face. ‘It was the most awful time, I couldn’t work and lived on painkillers,’ she says. Then in May 2010, nearly 18 months after the extraction, Carol had an operation to remove scar tissue, which was thought to be compounding the pain. But this made no difference, and she was told the nerve damage was permanent. Carol, pictured here, has received £15,000 from South Birmingham Primary Care Trust but she says she would give it all back to be rid of the pain she still suffers . ‘I was devastated. I just couldn’t believe all this was happening to me,’ she says. She went back to her dentist, who referred her to a different NHS . surgeon — he said she should have had a CT scan at the start; this would . have revealed how close the teeth were to the nerve, and a different . procedure could have been offered. It’s . a depressingly familiar scenario, says Luke Cascarini, a consultant . oral surgeon at BMI The Sloane Hospital and the North-West London NHS . Hospital Trust. ‘If . the nerve is too close then the patient should have a coronectomy — . where we remove the crown, but leave the root, preventing damage to . associated nerves.’ There . is also a question of whether extraction is advisable, especially as we . age. As Dr Jeremy Hill, of The Ware Centre of Dental Excellence in . Hertfordshire, says: ‘If a patient has them taken out in their late . teens then the jawbones are still quite flexible, which makes extraction . easier. 'But by their 30s or 40s, the jawbone has matured so it’s a lot . more difficult.’ Becky Dickinson found this out in January, when her  dentist yanked out her wisdom tooth. The mother-of-three from Addlestone, Surrey, had been told she needed the procedure because her wisdom tooth was impacted, and had probably caused a couple of minor infections. ‘I was given a local anaesthetic, but the dentist just couldn’t seem to get the tooth out. He was pulling and tugging and I could feel the most intense pressure. ‘In the end he had to chisel into the bone. My head felt like it was going to explode and the nurse had to hold me still. I was terrified.’ Once the tooth was out, over the next few days Becky, 40, was in so much pain she ended up in A&E. She was diagnosed with dry socket, where a blood clot fails to develop in the tooth socket — which affects 5 to 10 per cent of patients. This . exposes the nerve, causing unbearable pain. ‘There was nothing that . could be done other than let the tissue heal over the nerve,’ recalls . Becky. ‘I lived on painkillers for three months. 'My children are only . one, four and seven and it was so hard to do anything. I couldn’t sleep . because of the pain.‘Yet no one told me it could be like this, or . set out the pros and cons before the procedure. I’d been made to feel . wisdom teeth were a breeze.’ It’s . important to make sure you need the operation, stresses Mr Cascarini. ‘With problems such as repeated infections, it may well be that removing . them is necessary. Wisdom teeth, found at the back of the mouth, are the last four teeth to come through ¿ usually in our late teens or early 20s. There isn't always room for them to grow, so they can emerge at an angle or only partially break through - when they are described as 'impacted' 'However, . sometimes they are blamed unnecessarily when the teeth start to overlap . at the front. Some dentists believe it’s because they’re being pushed . by wisdom teeth — even if the teeth are deeply buried and there’s no . sign of decay. It’s far more likely that this overlapping is caused by . “anterior drift”, a movement of the teeth which is  simply part of the . ageing process.’ Mr Cascarini also says you need to ask how many of these extractions your dentist does a month. ‘I do ten a week and have done for 20 years. It needs to be done by someone with experience. And don’t be afraid to ask the dentist how long they take — even a complex tooth shouldn’t take more than 20 minutes — and how near to the nerve the wisdom tooth lies.’ Carol has since has received £15,000 from South Birmingham Primary Care Trust after the Dental Law Partnership negotiated an out- of-court settlement. Yet she says she would give it all back to be rid of the pain she still suffers. ‘I just wish I’d never had my  wisdom teeth out. Whatever they were trying to resolve is nothing  like the complications I have now.’","Without proper scans of teeth, there is a danger of permanent nerve damage .

"Tucked behind picture frames, inside bedside bibles and on top of toilet cisterns - one traveller is letting hoteliers know exactly what he thinks of their establishments. Self professed 'comedian and hotel graffiti artist'  David Bussell has spent seven years leaving his mark on rooms on his travels across the country and world. It is not clear whether his 'art' is considered cheeky graffiti, or irresponsible vandalism, but the 37-year-old Londoner insists he has never had a complaint from the establishment owners  - perhaps because they don't know it is there. The work of 'hotel graffiti' enthusiast David Bussell, who has left his 'amusing' mark on hotel rooms on travels over the past 7 years . The comedy writer and performer's hidden work have been secreted behind paintings and wall hangings in places ranging from Tenby in Wales to Guatamala City . The artist scrawls cheeky, head-scratching and provocative notes on the back of wardrobes, paintings, and mirrors . The comedian said: 'Boredom is my big motivator. I tend to just write whatever seems funny in the moment' The messages are often so well hidden that they may never be seen by hotel users . The comedy writer and performer's hidden work have been concealed in places ranging from Tenby in Wales to Guatamala City. His work also crops up in locations including London, Northern Ireland, Oxford, Edinburgh, Canterbury, Brighton, Manchester, Cuba, Berlin, and 'all over British Columbia and the United States'. Notes include 'Please No Baptising' above a sink, 'Mirror Broken, Please See Estimated Face' and 'This Hotel Wasn't Half Bad, It Was All The Way Bad'. While some may find his humour slightly tasteless, Mr Bussell, from Stoke Newington, London, says the inspiration for his unusual hobby came from a mix of childhood memories and boredom while travelling . However, he seems to be aware that his brand of toilet humour might not amuse everyone . The 37-year-old said he has left messages in every hotel he has stayed in since 2006 .

'I never leave something on show that won't rub right off, and the stuff that's hidden just stays that way, I guess' But the comedian said the only down side to leaving his gags concealed around the world, is that he never gets to witness the payoff . Mr Bussell said he was inspired by a holiday in Paris when he stayed in a backpacker hostel and found travellers had been using the flipside of a tacky painting as a 'secret bulletin board' 'I got the idea from a holiday in Paris back in the nineties when I stayed in a backpacker hostel and found travellers had been using the flipside of a tacky painting as a kind of secret bulletin board. 'When I was a kid I remember my parents redecorated their house and let me draw doodles on the plaster before they put up fresh paper. 'I was fascinated by the idea of the next tenant stripping it off one day and seeing the pictures I'd left them.

"A California mother couldn't believe her eyes or ears when she gave birth to a record-breaking 15 pound baby by Caesarean last week. Andrew Jacob Cervantez was 24 inches long and 15 lb, 2 oz in weight when he was delivered to 28-year-old Vanessa Cervantez at Desert Valley Hospital, Victorville, on Thursday. The huge newborn is thought to be heaviest ever born in California and is bigger than last year's largest baby, a 14lb boy born in Ohio in May 2013. Record breaker! Andrew Jacob was 24 inches long and 15 lb, 2 oz in weight when he was delivered last Thursday . 'I couldn't even believe it,' Cervantez told Victor Valley Daily Press. 'They had to double check because I didn't believe them; I thought the machine was broken.' The heaviest baby ever was 23 lb, 12 oz and born to Canadian giantess Anna Bates in 1879. But while Bates measured over 7 feet, Cervantez is a much more modest 5'1"". The mother of two said that her other children were also heavy at birth, weighing 10 lb, 10 oz and 9 lb, 14 oz respectively, but she hadn't expected to deliver a baby the size of Andrew Jacob. 'None of the doctors have ever delivered or heard of a baby being born that big here,' Cervantez, who is married to 29-year-old Daniel Cervantez, explained to the Daily Press. Scene: The baby was the heaviest ever born at Desert Valley Hospital, Victorville, California . 'My sister's been doing research and she doesn't think a baby weighing 15 pounds has ever been born in California,' the mother continued. Cervantez was 38 weeks pregnant when she went into hospital for routine tests on Thursday. When medics noticed decreased fetal movement they immediately performed a Caesarean operation. Andrew Jacob is currently in Loma Linda Children's Hospital. 'He's having trouble breathing on his own,' Cervantez said, 'that's what they're monitoring him for right now.'","Andrew Cervantez was 24 inches long and 15lb, 2oz when he was born .

"A six-year-old boy who suffers from an incredibly rare condition is not allowed to play outside in the winter, as catching a virus could kill him. The genetic disease, which affects just 50 people in the world, means Uzair Akhtar struggles to fight off the mildest infection. It means even a common cold or simple case of chicken pox could potentially kill him. He was diagnosed with Hyperimmunoglobin E Syndrome (HIES) two years ago, and without a life-saving bone marrow transplant he won't survive into adulthood. Uzair Akhtar, from Bradford, doesn't go out to play in winter as his mother is afraid he will be struck down by just a common cold, which could prove deadly . In the winter months, his parents wrap him up warm before he goes to school and don't like to take the risk of letting him play outside. His mother Sufia Rashid said: 'We have had a lot of snow recently and it's heartbreaking because we can't take the risk of letting him play outside. 'Just to get him to school, we have to dress him in thermals, leggings, multiple pairs of socks, a hat and a balaclava. You can only see his eyes, it's so sad but we have to make sure he doesn't get cold at all. 'Uzair wants to go and build snowmen and have snowball fights but just being outside for ten minutes could put him at risk of a life-threatening infection.' Although chilly temperatures have not been proven to increase your chance of catching a cold, winter weather may make the inside lining of your nose drier and more vulnerable to viral infection. The youngster, from Bradford, West Yorkshire, was a sickly child from birth and suffered regularly from colds and sickness bugs. But he was finally diagnosed with HIES after he contracted salmonella poisoning when he was four-years-old. The condition is caused by a mutation in his DOCK8 gene. After a month in hospital with rehydration treatments, Uzair was sent home but Sufia and his dad Pervaiz Akhtar, soon noticed he had relapsed. Further tests revealed Uzair's white blood cell count was between 50 and 60, when it should have been as low as 0.04 in a child of his age. Ms Rashid said: 'Generally he seemed OK in himself but he picked up lots of coughs and colds. We kept going back to hospital but they didn't know what was wrong with him. 'The doctors couldn't understand why his white blood cell count was so high.' Wrapped-up: Sufia dresses her son in thermals, leggings, a hat and balaclava to go to school . Leaving doctors at Bradford Royal Infirmary (BRI) baffled, specialists at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary (RVI) picked up on the syndrome, after Uzair was unable to stand on one leg when he got up one morning. Ms Rashid, 37, said: 'He said that he couldn't stand on one of his legs. I called the doctor and they told me to take him straight to hospital. 'They didn't know what had happened, he didn't have any broken bones which is what his symptoms suggested.' A series of MRI scans revealed Uzair had Osteomyelitis, a trait of HIES, which causes infection in the bone after it is spread through the blood. Uzair became so poorly his weight dropped to just 20kg and his spine protruded through his back. Ms Rashid had to be trained to give him intravenous injections through a tract which ran just centimetres from his heart, so he could have regular antibiotics, in an attempt to fight off the potentially deadly disease. Now, the youngster must have a cocktail of antiviral and immunoglobulin therapy injections up to four times a day, which are fed directly into his stomach. Without the antibodies, Uzair's immune system would be extremely low and his life would be at risk every time he stepped outside the house. But, the treatment is simply a short term fix, and Uzair must have a bone marrow transplant as soon as possible, to eliminate the syndrome from his body. Uzair Akhtar, with his parents and brother Eisa. He suffers from a condition which affects just 50 people in the world . Mr Pervaiz, a factory worker, said: 'When we heard a bone marrow transplant could cure Uzair we were over the moon. But this quickly turned to fear as our family was tested and no one was a match for Uzair. He needs a transplant from a stranger, but so far there's no one on the Anthony Nolan bone marrow register who's a suitable match.' Sufia, Pervaiz and Uzair's three-year-old brother Eisa are appealing for more people to be tested to see if their bone marrow is a match, in a desperate bid to save their son's life. Ms Rashid, a nursery nurse, said: 'The antiviral injections won't help him forever, one day he will become immune to them. 'He urgently needs bone marrow and we are urging people to come forward and be tested. Even if people don't match Uzair, they can be put on the Anthony Nolan register and they are very likely to be able to help someone else, who desperately needs life-saving treatment. 'Uzair knows he's different, he says 'mummy, I'm a bit more poorly than most people' and I explain it's because he needs some special blood to help him feel better.' Potential donors should be between the ages of 16-30 and in good health. Joining involves filling in a simple medical questionnaire and providing a saliva sample. Donating bone marrow is usually done through a process a bit like giving blood. Rebecca Sedgwick, national recruitment manager at Anthony Nolan, said: 'We need potential donors from the Pakistani community to join the register to give patients like Uzair a chance of life. 'Patients who are white northern European have a 90 per cent chance of finding a match, but this falls to 40 per cent for patients from minority ethnic backgrounds. 'Anyone aged 16-30 who can't attend the event can join online at www.anthonynolan.org. We especially need donors from all minority ethnic backgrounds to join.'","Uzair, 6, has a genetic condition that affects just 50 people in the world .

"Lynsey Sizer, 35, has to emerge slowly from bed . Few of us feel like leaping out of bed in the morning. But Lynsey Sizer has no choice but to emerge slowly from the covers. Any . fast movement - from dashing for the bus to jumping up to answer the . front door - triggers nausea and dizziness so severe she could lose her . balance, fall or even pass out. 'I have to move at a snail's pace . when I get out of bed,' says Lynsey, 35, a company director. 'I place my . feet on the floor and slowly uncurl so my head is the last thing up. If . I do it any other way I feel as if I am spinning. 'It's a pain, particularly as I have young children who want their mummy to spring into action in the morning. 'I . have to think about everything I do - something as simple as sitting on . the floor to play with them and then getting up can be hazardous. The . only exercise I can do is swimming, and that has to be a leisurely . breast stroke rather than front crawl.' Lynsey's problem is low blood pressure - or hypotension - which affects millions of people. The symptoms are caused by poor blood flow to the brain - the lack of oxygen leads to dizziness, fainting and nausea. 'Hypotension . in itself isn't dangerous in the way high blood pressure is - that is, . it isn't a precursor to, say, heart disease or strokes,' says Dr Nigel . Durham, a consultant cardiologist at York Hospital. 'What people do . suffer with are lacerations and injuries - even fractures - as a result . of falls or blackouts.' A normal blood pressure reading should be . 120/70 - the upper figure, known as systolic pressure, measures pressure . in your arteries when your heart contracts and pushes blood around your . body. If the reading is less than 100, this can trigger symptoms of low . blood pressure. These can occur very rapidly, as Lynsey knows. 'A . few years ago I was at Paddington station, coming back from work, when I . suddenly felt horrendously dizzy,' she says. 'I could feel . everything spinning around me. I leant against a wall to steady myself, . but then slumped to the ground. To make matters worse, a cyclist then . crashed into me.' Badly bruised down her leg from the impact, she . was taken by passers-by to a nearby pharmacy. The staff measured her . blood pressure and found it was extremely low - 80/50. After . drinking water and resting for 45 minutes, the dizziness passed and . Lynsey was able to make her way home to Maidenhead, Berkshire, where she . lives with her partner Kevin Broom, 37, a sales director, and their . children, Lily, five, and three-year-old twins, Owen and Riley. Low . blood pressure is triggered by changes in the autonomic nervous system, . which regulates the rate at which blood is pumped around the body. It . can be genetic - Lynsey's father has it, too. A few years ago she suddenly felt very dizzy on her way home from work and slumped to the ground . Other causes include . dehydration and vigorous exercise. This is because when we lose water - . through not drinking enough or sweating - the blood loses volume and . becomes more concentrated. Pressure is lowered, as it takes longer for . thicker blood to pump around the body. Surprisingly, taking . medication for high blood pressure - a condition that affects 16 million . adults - can also trigger the symptoms of low blood pressure. 'When . someone who is being treated with very high blood pressure starts . getting readings that are normal, the swing seems to cause them to feel . light-headed and dizzy, so we have to manage their medication . carefully,' says Dr Glynn Thomas, a cardiologist at the Bristol Heart . Institute. Other medication, including anti-depressants, can also cause low blood pressure. Some . people get it only after changing positions, such as when standing up - . a condition known as postural or orthostatic hypotension. When they . stand, gravity sends blood to the legs and away from the brain. The . heart rate increases and blood vessels tighten, causing a 'head rush'. Symptoms should last only a few seconds, while the blood pressure readjusts to the body's new position. Low . blood pressure can also occur after eating, known as postprandial . hypotension. This is more common in older people, particularly if they . have diabetes or, ironically, high blood pressure. A lot of blood is . needed in the intestine for digestion. So, if the heart rate doesn't . increase to maintain blood pressure, it drops. Some experience . symptoms after standing for long periods. This tends to affect children . and young adults, though it is unclear why. Whatever form, hypo- . tension can seriously interfere with day-to-day life. Megan Fell, 26, a . marketing officer from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, had to miss . surgery on her jaw because of it. Low blood pressure can be genetic - Lynsey's father has it, too . 'For a few years, I've suffered . with dizzy spells, sickness and black spots in front of my eyes if I . move too quickly or stand for a long time,' she says. The surgery . was to fix a painful joint disorder - cartilage in her mouth had been . displaced after she opened her mouth too widely to eat a burger. This . left it painful to eat, talk or even smile. Megan says: 'They wheeled . me down to surgery and did the pre-op tests. But when they took my blood . pressure it was too low  - the heart wasn't pumping blood around my . body quickly enough.' The surgery took place several months later, . when her blood pressure had reached a safe level to operate. She . achieved this partly by drinking lots of water. Lynsey's low blood . pressure was  identified by doctors at the age of nine, though no . treatment was given. But her symptoms became especially acute when she . was pregnant with Lily. 'I was vomiting up to ten times a day,' she says. 'I was put on salt tablets for around five months, which helped a bit.' Salt . causes water to be absorbed into the blood, increasing its volume and . so raising blood pressure - which is why people with high blood pressure . are told to limit their intake. Drugs such as Midodrine are . occasionally prescribed by specialists to increase blood volume or to . narrow the arteries - doing this means there is more blood flowing . through a smaller space, helping maintain blood pressure. However, the . main advice is lifestyle changes. These include simple steps such as . avoiding sudden movements, and stretching or crossing and uncrossing . the legs before standing up to prevent blood from pooling in the legs. Compression . stoc-kings can also make a difference, says Dr  Thomas. They provide . extra pressure to the feet and legs, forcing blood back into the . abdomen, where it can move freely to the brain. The proportion of people who don't know their blood pressure . Patients should also . avoid caffeine at night, and limit their alcohol intake to prevent . dehydration. And some may need to add more salt to their diet, says Dr . Thomas. But this should be done only on a doctor's advice, as overdoing . it can raise blood pressure. If you think you have low blood pressure, see your GP. You may be given a 24-hour blood pressure monitor to aid diagnosis. For . Lynsey, anticipation is the key. 'I know what my triggers are, so I do . my best to avoid things that will cause problems, though I feel a bit . silly sometimes when people see me moving around in slow motion,' she . says. 'The other day, when everyone was rushing for the train home . from work, I was meandering along. I'd rather wait for the next train - . it's better than falling down because I feel so dizzy.'","Lynsey Sizer, 35, from Maidenhead, Berkshire, suffers from hypotension .

"Wandering on to the patio at a friend’s 40th birthday, I pull my husband, Martin, towards me and nuzzle my face into his neck, inhaling his aftershave like a lovesick teenager on a first date. Of course, I’m far from a teen — we’ve been married for 23 years, tying the knot two years after meeting through mutual friends. So what accounts for my frisky, romantic mood? Well, it could be the cocktails. Or the fact that on this balmy evening, the air is thick with the grassy scent of summer. Or the fact that Martin, a 49-year-old chartered accountant — still so handsome after all these years, with his thick, floppy hair and a physique honed by cycling — looks especially dashing in his crisp shirt and chinos. Wedded bliss: The catalyst for this unrepentant Public Display of Affection was the sight of a newly divorced friend hovering on the margins of the lawn . But it wasn’t any of the above. The catalyst for this unrepentant Public Display of Affection was the sight of a newly divorced friend hovering on the margins of the lawn, clearly adrift without a partner by her side. Not that I’m territorial about my husband — I’m not one of those insecure wives who arm-locks her spouse at the first whiff of another woman’s Decree Absolute. Quite the opposite. I like to be around freshly minted divorcees and actively encourage them to come for dinner or drop in for coffee. And my reasons are unapologetically pragmatic. Watching an ex-wife navigate a party teeming with couples is a frank reminder that her fabled grass isn’t any greener — all fresh starts and new opportunities — it’s just more grass. And it looks markedly less lush than my carefully tended lawn. Most importantly, it sparks a reflex reaction to slip my hand into Martin’s and squeeze, reminding myself — and him — how much I still love him after all these years. Louise Tyler, a relationships counsellor who runs the Personal Resilience clinic in Cheshire, agrees: . ‘The aftermath of divorce is incredibly painful. Witnessing this first-hand can encourage couples — especially those dissatisfied with their marriage — to do everything they can to make it work.’ That’s why I’ve no truck with the so-called domino-divorce effect — the notion that if a close friend or colleague splits up it triggers other break-ups within their social circle. The aftermath of divorce is incredibly . painful. Witnessing this first-hand can encourage couples — especially . those dissatisfied with their marriage — to do everything they can to . make it work . Louise Tyler, relationships counsellor . I realise this herd mentality seems endemic. Indeed, one U.S. study estimated that if the marriage of someone close to you breaks down, your own chance of getting divorced is as much as 75 per cent. The hypothesis being that close proximity to divorce makes you question your own marriage, and helps remove the stigma of deciding to walk if you’ve had enough of your own spouse. But, for me, a divorce in my social circle acts as a clarion call to count my blessings, and focus on strengthening what I have. Before I go on, let me be clear that I understand there are some insoluble marital problems, such as domestic violence (whether physical or emotional) or serial affairs, that make it impossible for a wife to remain with her husband. However, in recent years I’ve been shocked by the number of friends and colleagues who decided to get divorced simply because they felt a nebulous disaffection towards their marriage. Or as one old friend told me: ‘I was fed up — and couldn’t face another 40 years of this.’ And so she disposed of her husband — an amiable, witty chap — tossing aside their lovely home and their life with their three children like a scrunched-up Kleenex. Did she think that a dashing fighter pilot or heart-meltingly handsome white knight would be immune to leaving his socks on the floor or dozing in front of the telly after a long day saving the world? I’ve interviewed plenty of high-profile men over the years — and it’s clear from talking to their wives that they snore as loudly as the rest of the male population. But my friend went on to discover this the hard way, as I learnt a couple of weeks ago. She told me that after hurling herself on to the dating scene and kissing a few frogs she thought she’d found a prince — significantly solvent, ruggedly handsome, with children who had left home. And so my friend raised her hopes only for them to be dashed on the altar of his insecurity, commitment phobia and good old-fashioned male selfishness. Secret to marriage success: Angela sees ex-wives as her marriage life-line . Now she’s back in the ring, with tales of an unseemly scramble with other divorcees to nab an eligible bloke — or one who at least has his own hair and teeth. Just listening to her made me long to be at home, curled up on the sofa with Martin. Yet still there are plenty of women who regret, despite having manifest domestic stability, ‘settling’ for anything other than turbo-charged sex or starry-eyed romance. Little wonder a recent survey of family lawyers revealed that the most popular cause for divorce was that couples were simply ‘no longer in love’ and had ‘grown apart’. I remember the very first divorce in my social circle. It happened several years ago, crashing over our group like a tsunami. I was just so shocked that, after raising three children very close in age, this couple could come out the other side — then throw it all away. Neither had a specific reason. It just seemed that a once robust relationship had shattered into boredom, resentment and frustration. They hinted that having married in their early 20s and spent 15 years together, they felt there was a new world out there, waiting for them to enjoy. Did I feel envious? After all, I was also married in my early 20s, and in over two decades since then there have been times when I’ve felt restless or frustrated by domestic life. On days when my husband nags me about forgetting to lock my car and the children squabble endlessly, I think of the young, bright, fancy-free woman in my head who yearns for romance and freedom. But then I tell myself — and it’s not always easy — she is still there. And she can work hard to indulge those feelings. She just needs to do so with the man she loves. Anyway, such restlessness is balanced by those moments when you walk into a cosy house and see all the people most precious to you, curled up on sofas like puppies. When I spot another ex-wife, I see her not as a threat, but as my Plimsoll line — the secret to keeping my own marriage afloat . But there are other ways my divorced friends help consolidate my marriage too. Living in a close-knit community, where the dining room table is the heart of our social life, the break-up of a couple elicits a rush by us smug still-marrieds to ‘take in’ one partner or the other for a home-cooked meal. Often we’re invited out to dinner where one half of a divorced couple is on the guest list. Looking across the table, I slip my hand into Martin’s and think: ‘I never want to become someone else’s good deed.’ Deep down, I suspect women who get divorced don’t enjoy their ‘freedom’ as much as they claim. Research this year found that, even in the age of the pre-nup and the fault-free divorce, almost half of divorcees believe their lives are damaged by the stigma. But these hapless, disorientated, newly divorced friends spur me on — to slip into a new, slinky dress; to have my hair freshly styled; to recognise that, however frustrating my husband’s peccadilloes, they’re no more so than any other man’s. Or, for that matter, my own. So when I spot another ex-wife, I see her not as a threat, but as my Plimsoll line — the secret to keeping my own marriage afloat.","Ex-wives on the hunt for new men makes Angela count her blessings .

"An Indiana woman was sentenced Friday to 15 years to life in a California prison for the 2001 murder of her 2-month-old daughter in Desert Hot Springs, about 80 miles east of Los Angeles, a prosecutor’s spokesman said. A Riverside County jury had convicted Krissy Lynn Werntz earlier this year on a charge of second-degree murder in the death of her daughter Montana. Werntz, 34, was arrested along with Montana’s father, Jason Michael Hann, in 2002 after the infant’s body was found in a storage unit in Arkansas. 15 to life: Krissy Lynn Werntz was found guilty of murdering her infant daughter and hiding the remains in a rented storage unit . Bonnie and Clyde: Jason Hann, pictured, was arrested alongside Werntz in 2002 after authorities found their daughter's remains in a storage unit . The couple had stopped making rental payments and the unit’s contents had been sold at auction. Police caught up with the couple in Portland, Maine, and quickly learned that Montana had died in Desert Hot Springs in 2001. Authorities later determined that Hann beat the 10-week-old girl to death before wrapping duct tape around her head and putting her body in a trash bag. The couple then drove the girl's dead body from California to Arkansas, where they left it in the storage unit. Within days of their initial arrest, authorities had discovered another infant’s body — this time a 2-month-old boy who also was a child of the murderous couple — in a different storage unit in Arizona. The boy’s body had been hidden there in 2000, about 18 months after he died, prosecutors said. Pay your bills: The girl's remains were found when Werntz stopped paying the bill for the storage unit where they had hid the body . Police believe the baby died in Vermont and that Werntz and Hann, 39, trekked around the country with the remains in a plastic bin before renting the Arizona unit, prosecutors said this week. 'It was like some twisted, baby-killing Bonnie and Clyde,' Riverside prosecutor Lisa DiMaria said of the couple, according to the Desert Sun. During the investigation, authorities also found the couple’s third child, a 1-month-old boy, alive but suffering from a dozen broken ribs and retinal hemorrhaging — signs of child abuse. That child was placed in foster care and ultimately adopted. Hann was convicted of Montana’s murder in 2013 and sentenced to death earlier this year. He was also convicted of second-degree murder in Vermont for the boy’s death and sentenced to 27 to 30 years in prison. Defense attorneys argued that Hann's bouts with severe bipolar disorder should be considered and that he be charged with second-degree murder instead of first-degree. Death: Hann was sentenced to death for his daughter's murder after a judge allowed jurors to consider the fact that he'd already been convicted of murdering his son . Hann's lawyer, Brenda Miller, compared his cycles of rage to a swing on a playground, explaining that it goes up and down. One day, she said, his young daughter took the brunt of it. 'Just as his anxiety and his rage was reaching its peak, Montana began . to cry, and her cries got louder and louder, and his rage just . exploded,' Miller said. Miller told jurors that he had been treated for the disorder several times in the past, but checked himself out of mental health facilities against the advice of doctors. He also refused to take medication to treat the disorder, she said. Werntz was not charged in the boy’s death.","Krissy Werntz was found guilty of murder in the beating death of her 2-month-old daughter .

"There are only two places to see a gallery of artwork depicting key events in the history of U.S. intelligence services: The headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency and an out-of-the way museum in Alabama. Tucked away in a neighborhood near Birmingham's airport, the Southern Museum of Flight this month opened a gallery featuring 16 reproductions of original artwork donated to the CIA and displayed at its building in McLean, Va. Based upon once-secret events that have since been declassified, the artwork provides a rare glimpse into decades of U.S. spy work. One print depicts a B-26 bomber flying over Cuba during the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion in 1961, when Alabama National Guard pilots flew for the CIA in a bid to overthrow the government of Fidel Castro. Art attack: Air operations of Civil Air Transport, an Agency proprietary, and its CIA contract pilots in support of French forces at Dien Bien Phu, Indochina, in 1954, during the final days of the conflict between the French and Viet Minh . New collection:  Jim Griffin, executive director of the Southern Museum of Flight in Birmingham, Alabama viewing a new exhibit titled Shadow Gallery, The Art of Intelligence . Another print shows World War II spy Virginia Hall tapping out code in occupied France, another a sunken Soviet submarine being lifted off the ocean floor during a secret 1974 operation. The general public can't see the paintings at the spy agency - they are housed in a secure area frequented only by employees, official visitors and VIPs. But $7 will get anyone a ticket into the Alabama museum to view both the prints and historic aircraft such as an old Soviet helicopter, a World War II bomber pulled from a lake after crashing in South Carolina, and an A-12 Blackbird spy plane that once flew over Southeast Asia taking top-secret photographs. 'It's a one-of-a-kind deal,' museum Director Jim Griffin said. Cast of a Few, Courage of a Nation:  Within 15 days of the attacks in the United States, the first team of CIA officers was on the ground and operating in Afghanistan to make contacts with opposition groups in the prelude to Operation Enduring Freedom . Seven Days in the Arctic: During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union competed for every advantage, including study of the Arctic for its strategic value . The exhibit, housed in a large room near old biplanes and aircraft engines, is titled 'Shadow Gallery, The Art of Intelligence.' Artist Jeff Bass, who painted three commissioned works that hang in both the cloistered CIA museum and the Alabama display, said he's glad to have a new, less-exclusive audience for his art. He spoke at the opening of the Birmingham exhibit Nov. 15 and said he was impressed by the display. 'A print, as an artist, is never going to be fully representative of the original artwork,' said Bass, of Pensacola, Fla. 'But the prints are very high quality and representative of what you see at the agency. They tell a story.' CIA spokesman Todd Ebitz said the agency isn't aware of any collection similar to the one in Birmingham, although the CIA displays some items on its website and has loaned some historical objects to nonprofit museums. Air Combat First: On 12 January 1968, four North Vietnamese Air Force AN-2 Colt biplanes lifted off from an airfield in northeastern North Vietnam and headed west toward Laos. The aircraft were on a mission to destroy a US radar base that was guiding bombers in attacks against targets in North Vietnam. Untouchable: Only 15 were built, and only three would fly operational missions, ironically none over the USSR, before the aircraft were put in storage to be replaced by the US Air Force version of the plane, the SR-71 . The Southern Museum of Flight developed the exhibit through years of work after learning about the CIA gallery almost by chance. The works displayed at CIA headquarters were funded by private contributions and donated to the CIA, said Erik Kirzinger, who played a key role in helping put the collection together. While artist Dru Blair was working on a piece for the CIA depicting a flight of the A-12 spy plane now in Birmingham, he contacted the museum seeking photos of the aircraft to ensure historical accuracy, Griffin said. Museum staffers photographed the plane from multiple angles and sent the images to Blair, and Griffin came away with the idea of developing a 'shadow' collection of artwork to mirror the paintings housed at the CIA. 'Some of the paintings include aircraft that we have here in the museum, like the A-12,' Griffin said. Les Marguerites Fleuriront ce Soir: Virginia Hall was a Baltimore native who joined the US State Department in the 1930s. At the outbreak of WW II, she eagerly joined the British Special Operations Executive (SOE) to fight fascism . The Day the Wall Came Down: The world watched as the Berlin Wall fell on 9 November 1989 . One artist led to another, Griffin said, and the museum eventually secured prints of 16 of the 18 works displayed at CIA headquarters. Some artists donated their works, Griffin said, and others provide the art at deeply discounted prices. Installed as a permanent exhibit at the Birmingham museum, the prints are accompanied both by written explanations of the historic events they depict and stories of how the artists completed the artwork. Bass said some of the works have been displayed outside CIA headquarters, including his painting of Hall sending secret messages in July 1944. The painting has been widely reproduced by publications, including Smithsonian Magazine. But so many works from the CIA collection have never before been available to so many people outside the agency's walls, he said. 'It's certainly unique,' Bass said.","Based upon once-secret events that have since been declassified .

"David Cameron once famously warned of the potential of Twitter embarrassing politicians. But in an extraordinary online blunder, the Prime Minister’s official account has managed to offend the victims of the terror attack in Kenya, survivors of the Brighton bombing and Foreign Secretary William Hague. A tweet, which claims an image of Norman Tebbit being lifted from the Brighton bomb wreckage looked like he was enjoying sex, was apparently ticked as a ‘favourite’ by Mr Cameron. Blunder: David Cameron's official account listed just one tweet as a 'favourite' - from an account which suggests a photo of Norman Tebbit being lifted from the wreckage of the Brighton bomb looks like he is enjoying sex . Aftermath: Lord Tebbit is treated after the IRA bombing at the Grand Hotel in Brighton . Downing Street struggled to explain the blunder, which came after the PM used the site to pay his respects to the people of Kenya after armed terrorists stormed a Nairobi shopping centre. The Prime Minister, who once warned 'too many tweets might make a tw*t', wrote that he gave his ‘condolences to President Kenyatta after the attack on the #Westgate shopping centre’ and revealed Mr Hague would give a statement. The tweet received dozens of responses, including one from a spoof account named @AdrianBurley, although the Tory MP has not connection with the account. It read: ‘@David_Cameron please call off @WilliamHague, hasn’t Kenya suffered enough today?’ To add . to the sense of revulsion, the account uses an image of Lord Tebbit . being lifted from the wreckage of the Brighton bombing in 1984, in which . five people died and his wife was left disabled. The revolting name of the account suggests the picture of Lord Tebbit  was taken while having sex. Rescue mission: An image from AFP TV shows military forces taking position inside the shopping mall . Norman Tebbit today called for David Cameron to be removed as Tory leader. In criticism unrelated to the Twitter blunder, the former Conservative party chairman accused Mr Cameron of failing to take the threat of UKIP seriously. He claimed Mr Cameron's modernisation programme had driven Tory voters away. He told Sky News: 'I think we have to take UKIP seriously because so many ex-Tory voters are attracted to it. 'If I took over a shop in the high street which used to have a lot of customers, and found that the customers were going past my shop and going down the road to a competitor, I wouldn’t do what Ken Clarke has advised which is to stand in the street abusing one’s ex-customers in the hope that that will bring them back into your shop. 'I’d go and see what the other guy was selling, and if I found out it was pretty well what I used to sell in my shop, I think I’d fire the purchasing manager of the shop and get some goods back in that attracted the people in. 'And that’s what the Tory party’s got to do - we’ve got to take seriously why people are attracted to UKIP.' Someone monitoring Mr Cameron’s . account then pressed the ‘favourite’ button, making it the only tweet to . be singled out in this way by the Prime Minister since he joined . Twitter a year ago. Downing Street last night said it had been a ‘mistake’, but was unable to say whether the error had been made by Mr Cameron himself or one of his officials. Lord Tebbit, one of the stars of Margaret Thatcher’s Cabinet, was badly injured in the Brighton attack, which killed five and injured dozens. His wife Margaret was left permanently disabled and he later stepped down from frontline politics to care for her. The bombing, which took place during the Conservative Party conference, was a deliberate attempt to assassinate the Cabinet. In the last year Mr Cameron has built up more than 450,000 followers, but has been bombarded by abuse. A Labour party source said: ‘This is highly offensive to both the victims of the Kenya attack and the Brighton bomb.’ To add to the insensitivity of the Tory error, it emerged just hours before it was announced that at least three Britons were among those killed in Kenya. Sources said Mr Cameron’s account is used by the Prime Minister himself. But senior officials also have access to it on his behalf. A spokesman said: ‘This is a deeply offensive account that the Prime Minister would never want to be associated with. ‘Clearly the Tweet was favourited by mistake and was removed as soon as it was realised.’ Its not the first time that Twitter has left Mr Cameron red-faced. In July he blundered when he apparently confused a Cabinet minister with a spoof Twitter account. The Prime Minister wrote: 'We're rolling out a cap on Benefits today - @IDS_MP and I are determined to make work pay.' But @IDS_MP is not Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith but a parody Twitter account mocking the minister. The clues that the @IDS_MP account was not real were there. The account biography includes 'parodia' and the phrase 'chin chin old bean'. Previous tweets included: 'I've always supported a Mansion Tax. Your Tax buys my Mansion. Chin chin!'","Prime Minister told his 450,000 followers of sadness at Nairobi slaughter .

"Mysterious: Someone uploaded a PDF version of this book of three previously unpublished and largely unseen J.D. Salinger stories . After years of remaining unseen by nearly all his fans, three stories by reclusive author J.D. Salinger leaked online Wednesday. The unpublished stories were once only available for academics to read while under guard in libraries at the University of Texas and at Princeton. One of the stories—titled The Ocean Full of Bowling Balls—is a precursor to the Salinger classic The Catcher in the Rye. Also leaked were Birthday Boy, about a . young man in rehab for alcoholism, and Paula, which recounts the tale . of a woman whose pregnancy drives her to insanity then ruins her . marriage. As per Salinger’s will, the stories weren’t to be published until 2051. None . of them have ever been published, but The Ocean Full of Bowling Balls . was written for publication in  Harper’s Bazaar before the author . withdrew it. The story details the death of Kenneth Caulfield, the character Salinger would later turn into Holden Caulfield’s brother Allie. Princeton’s was once the only manuscript of The Ocean Full of Bowling Balls available to be read. The reclusive author specified in his will that the stories not be published until 2060. One of the stories The Ocean Full of Bowling Balls, details lives of characters who are also in his classic The Catcher in the Rye . Plot thickens: Though the stories were never published, the eBay auction where the PDF version available online reportedly originates sold a hardcover book that appears to have been printed for publication. It has an ISBN number that does not work . Buzzfeed spoke to a gentleman named PJ Vogt who’s read both the Princeton copy and the online version. He verified the story’s authenticity. ‘I . definitely remember that first line,’ Vogt said. ‘”His shoes turned . up.” And I remember the detail about the India ink on the catcher’s . mitt. And that Holden has a cameo from camp.’ But Vogt's revelation also further deepened the mystery. 'My . memory is that Princeton’s copy looked like a submission — typed out . pages, maybe even double-spaced. These seem too laid out to be from that . collection,' he said. The author of J.D. Salinger: A Life confirmed the authenticity of all three manuscripts. ‘While . I do quibble with the ethics (or lack of ethics) in posting the . Salinger stories,’ Kenneth Slawenski told Buzzfeed, ‘they look to be . true transcripts of the originals and match my own copies.’ The PDF first sprung up on the invite-only bit torrent site what.CD. The source was allegedly an eBay auction of a book, complete with cover, titled Three Stories. A . Reddit contributor then told the whole world about the find and the . rest will go down into the history annals of Salinger’s mysterious life.

"Making my way towards the stairs in a town centre camera shop, I almost came to a crashing halt after catching sight of something on display I hadn't expected to see. No, not a state-of-the-art tripod or elegant pewter frame, but a generous glimpse of a globular breast, crammed into the mouth of a suckling infant. Breast and baby belonged to a woman in her early 30s who'd selected the bottom step as a place to feed her baby. Mothers up in arms: Dozens joined in a breast-feeding protest in support of Emily Slough . Feeling queasy at the unanticipated sight, as well as more than a little disturbed by the woman's apparent indifference to the feelings of everyone else and her unapologetic willingness to feed in the centre of a busy store, I tried to look anywhere other than in front of me. This was especially difficult since I had to navigate my way around mother and child before sprinting to the first floor. What is it about some breast- feeding mums? Why do they think they have the inalienable right to nurse their babies anywhere they like, without giving any thought to the location or the sensitivities of those around them? I say this not as some dried-up prude who's never experienced a cracked nipple. No, I say this as a mother who breast-fed four children, but always resisted the urge  to do so in anything other than a discreet way. Aside from not wishing strangers (or even friends) to be party to what I believe is the most lovely and intimate of acts, I imagine few would have relished the sight  of my hungry infant slurping down its elevenses. Emily Slough has been involved in a public breast feeding event . Emily was labelled a 'Tramp' by a photographer who snapped her breast-feeding her baby Matilda in her local town centre . Unfortunately, thanks to the . increasingly militant voice of the 'breastapo', criticising a woman who . breast-feeds in public is tantamount to treason. After . I suggested on a BBC radio programme this week that mothers should be . circumspect about where they nurse their babies, the response was little . short of nuclear, with opprobrium piled on me by the vocal . pro-breast-feeding lobby. But . I was struck by how many messages I received online and in conversation . from woman who felt the same way as me. They told me I had articulated . the views they felt too afraid to express themselves. That's right, too . afraid. As one said, . after finding herself next to a woman at a bus stop feeding her child: . 'I felt violated since she had no thoughts for my feelings, but you just . can't say that nowadays, can you?' There has been a rash of stories about women who say they've been victimised for breast-feeding in public. One was ticked off for doing so at a naval museum, another in a hospital waiting room. Following her appearance on BBC Radio, Angela was inundated with messages from women who are offended by public breast-feeding . Last . week, 27-year-old Emily Slough was photographed feeding her . eight-month-old daughter on the steps of a Staffordshire pub while . eating a sandwich. She was unaware of the photographer who later posted the picture on Facebook with the charming inscription: 'I know the sun is out 'n' all that, but there's no need to let your kid  feast on your nipple in town!!! Tramp.' To label Emily a tramp was a vile insult. But when I saw the picture, there was a part of me, while not condoning the language or actions of the photographer, that could see why her behaviour may have triggered an adverse reaction. For rather than looking for somewhere low-key to feed her daughter, Emily chose to park herself in the middle of a busy town centre, shopping bags sprawled around her feet. I wouldn't do that with just a  sandwich in my hand, never mind with a little one to attend to. Surely where we choose to breast-feed requires more graciousness than that? 'To all too many breast-feeding mothers, . this word 'natural' nourishes the belief that  they have a licence to do . it anywhere. Regardless of who is watching.' Of course, there's nothing worse than feeling under pressure to feed a howling, hungry baby, especially since its anguished cry can make your breasts leak like a faulty washer. I've been there myself -  many times. But I never felt the needs of my baby awarded me the right to breast-feed wherever I chose. If I was out shopping, I'd sprint back to the car, find a seat in the corner of a cafe or retreat to an out-of-the- way park bench. Yet over and over again I've had no choice but to been confronted by earth mothers on the train, in restaurants, in the middle of busy shopping centres or at picnic sites breast-feeding in full view, without any attempt to be discreet. It goes without saying that breast-feeding - for those who can and want to do it - is a wonderful thing. Indeed, 81 per cent of women now start their babies on breast milk compared with just 66 per cent in the mid-Nineties. It's good for the baby's health, as well as easier for mum than having to sterilise bottles and buy formula. Oh yes, and it's also natural. And that's the killer point. To all too many breast-feeding mothers, this word 'natural' nourishes the belief that  they have a licence to do it anywhere. Regardless of who is watching. Angela Epstein says she feels queasy when she witnesses mothers breast-feeding in public . What they are forgetting  is that breasts are, by their nature, sexual. Why else do women crowbar their bosoms into clingy dresses and skimpy bikinis? They want the world to see that they are attractive. But things change when you're breast-feeding. During this time, breasts are not intended to flaunt your sexual availability to the world, but to meet the needs of one little person - your baby. That's why so many women feel unsettled when we see a mother treating breast-feeding like a spectator sport. The combative attitude of the breast-feeding lobby is part of the problem. Emily Slough took, to my mind, an inflammatory course of action when she retaliated to the nasty Facebook posting by organising a breast-feeding demonstration around the Rugeley pub where she had been photographed. The site of a phalanx of women with boobs visible at 50 paces and babies latched on turned my stomach. Such an aggressive exploitation of a tender maternal act was, to me, the ultimate betrayal of what breast-feeding is all about. It should be an intimate, bonding experience, not a show to prove a political point. Certainly, breast-feeding was a private and special time for me and my babies. I especially enjoyed it with my daughter, Sophie, now nine. She was the youngest by six years and, uninterrupted by demanding toddlers as I had been with my other children, I could relax, sit quietly and enjoy the experience, knowing it was what we both wanted. I used to love feeling utterly justified in plonking myself in front of some slushy afternoon movie and just letting her take her time. No one is suggesting women shouldn't be allowed to breast-feed their children. In fact, the 2010 Equality Act states it is unlawful for mums to be discriminated against or treated unfavourably because they are breast-feeding. But perhaps the politicians behind this statute should have insisted facilities were made available in shopping centres, supermarkets and department stores to enable mothers to feed in private. Instead, the rest of us are made to feel like criminals for wanting to look away.","Angela says she is sick of seeing women publicly breast-feed .

"These eerie photographs show the London Underground as few see it: empty. Social media director James Whatley, 34, has spent six years compiling the collection, which includes Paddington, Baker Street, Piccadilly Circus, Waterloo and many others at their least busy. ‘It was almost accidental if I’m perfectly honest,’ he says. ‘I’ve spent nearly six years capturing these moments and it was only after the first five that I realised I was making a hobby of it. After a while it became a challenge. Whenever I was in a new station, I found myself looking for the parts that might be empty.' He added: ‘I describe my project as “an absence of occupance” - it’s devoid of the very thing that it was built for. Our London Underground is a permanent timeline of iconic design architecture, and you only really get to see it like that when it is empty.’ This photograph shows an empty Maida Vale station. Sitting on the Bakerloo Line, the station, to the north-west of Paddington, dates back nearly 100 years to 1915 . A rare sight: This image, caught by James Whatley, shows Bank-Monument station, which is usually packed with City of London workers during the week . A Northern Line train approaches the platform at Angel. This station, just east of King's Cross St Pancras, is home to the system's longest escalator, which is 60m long . Queen's Park station, pictured in a deserted state here, was originally built on the main line between London and Birmingham. It has been on the Bakerloo Line since 1915 and was recently added to the London Overground . Mr Whatley, who has pictured London Bridge here, which is usually packed with commuters during weekday mornings and evenings, says: 'It's actually relatively easy to photograph the stations completely empty. The commuters of the London Underground move like waves; like tides the crowds come in and out' Paddington station, seen here, connects to the Circle, District, Bakerloo and Hammersmith & City lines. It also used to be on the Metropolitan Railway and was part of the world's very first underground line, which ran between this station and Farringdon in 1863 . Regent's Park, on the Bakerloo Line, is often teaming with tourists, often heading to London Zoo. Not here, as Mr Whatley managed to capture the station empty . Piccadilly Circus is another station caught by Mr Whatley in a sleepy state. 'An empty underground can occur at any point in the day, you just have to look out for it' This photograph shows Kilburn Park station, which is on the Bakerloo Line . Holborn, on the Piccadilly and Central lines, is another station packed during commuting hours. Mr Whatley says: 'It's interesting seeing or hearing about different tastes, as some people prefer the platforms, and some people prefer the trains' Maida Vale station pictured from an upper level. Interestingly, when the station opened in 1915, it was entirely staffed by women . Eerie: This photograph shows a deserted corridor on the Waterloo & City line. Linking Waterloo and Bank, the line opened in 1898 . Connected on five lines (the Metropolitan, Circle, Jubilee, Bakerloo and Hammersmith & City), Baker Street has ten platforms - more than any other Underground station . This photograph shows Regent's Park. The station, which was opened in March 1906, has no surface buildings and is accessed from a subway . This photograph shows the abandoned Aldwych Underground station. Located on the Strand, the station was on the end of a branch of the Piccadilly Line. It opened in 1907 and closed in 1994 . This photograph again shows Baker Street station in an empty state. Opened in 1863, it was one of the stations on the Metropolitan Railway line between Paddington and Farringdon . Pictured again, Baker Street has proved to be one of Mr Whatley's favourite stations.

"The world is aging so fast that most countries are not prepared to support their swelling numbers of elderly people, according to a global study  by the United Nations and an elder rights group. The report ranks the social and economic well-being of elders in 91 countries, with Sweden coming out on top and Afghanistan at the bottom. It reflects what advocates for the old have been warning, with increasing urgency, for years: Nations are simply not working quickly enough to cope with a population graying faster than ever before. Ingrid Foerster, 82: 'I am most afraid of losing my mental and physical independence and becoming a nursing case. The biggest problem for the elderly is living a solitary life.' Hamid Mohammed, 65: Father of six daughters, three of whom are married, said he is terribly afraid of the absolute misery that may descend on his family if he, the only earning member, loses his job as a rickshaw puller . Retiree Padma Sagaram, 63: 'I am afraid of illnesses and being financially dependent on others. Growing older, there is a great sense of fear of being alone. I have children, but they have lives too. What about other elderly who have no children?' By the year 2050, for the first time in history, seniors over the age of 60 will outnumber children under the age of 15. Truong Tien Thao, who runs a small tea shop on the sidewalk near his home in Hanoi, Vietnam, is 65 and acutely aware that he, like millions of others, is plunging into old age without a safety net. He wishes he could retire, but he and his 61-year-old wife depend on the $50 a month they earn from the tea shop. And so every day, Thao rises early to open the stall at 6 a.m. and works until 2 p.m., when his wife takes over until closing. Pedro Vega Yucra, 80: 'My biggest fear is that one day I will not have anything to eat or even the energy to work on my own. In the rural areas of my country, we, the elderly, die and nobody notices. As you become old, no one cares.' Egyptian farmer Mahmoud Hussein, 75: 'I'm afraid that my children will hurt me, kick me out of my house and I will die alone. The biggest problem facing elderly Egyptians is the lack of health insurance and retirement pay like in civilized countries.' 'People at my age should have a rest, but I still have to work to make our ends meet,' he says, while waiting for customers at the shop, which sells green tea, cigarettes and chewing gum. 'My wife and I have no pension, no health insurance. I'm scared of thinking of being sick — I don't know how I can pay for the medical care.' Thao's story reflects a key point in the report, which was released early to The Associated Press: Aging is an issue across the world. Perhaps surprisingly, the report shows that the fastest aging countries are developing ones, such as Jordan, Laos, Mongolia, Nicaragua and Vietnam, where the number of older people will more than triple by 2050. All ranked in the bottom half of the index. The Global AgeWatch Index (www.globalagewatch.org) was created by elder advocacy group HelpAge International and the U.N. Population Fund in part to address a lack of international data on the extent and impact of global aging. The index, released on the U.N.'s International Day of Older Persons, compiles data from the U.N., World Health Organization, World Bank and other global agencies, and analyzes income, health, education, employment and age-friendly environment in each country. Nissim Pinto, 79: 'I'm afraid of nothing. I just don't really know how to continue my life as I get older like I used to live for almost the last 80 years. I don't like when young people treat me as an old man when I wait in line at the supermarket.' Sandra S. Harris, 67: 'I'm most afraid of losing my memory. With so many cases of Alzheimer's, it frightens me. I worry about remembering the past, people and friends and the things I have done and can't recall.' Richard Hardick, 74: 'I'm not afraid of getting older. I surf, I fly fish in Alaska, I teach at a high school. I happen to be a little different than most: I'm religious. I've taken vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience.' The index was welcomed by elder rights advocates, who have long complained that a lack of data has thwarted their attempts to raise the issue on government agendas. 'Unless you measure something, it doesn't really exist in the minds of decision-makers,' said John Beard, Director of Ageing and Life Course for the World Health Organization. 'One of the challenges for population aging is that we don't even collect the data, let alone start to analyze it. ... For example, we've been talking about how people are living longer, but I can't tell you people are living longer and sicker, or longer in good health.' The report fits into an increasingly complex picture of aging and what it means to the world. On the one hand, the fact that people are living longer is a testament to advances in health care and nutrition, and advocates emphasize that the elderly should be seen not as a burden but as a resource. On the other, many countries still lack a basic social protection floor that provides income, health care and housing for their senior citizens. Afghanistan, for example, offers no pension to those not in the government. Life expectancy is 59 years for men and 61 for women, compared to a global average of 68 for men and 72 for women, according to U.N. data. Amadou Mbaye, 74: ""Since God allowed me to live to 74, I can only thank him. I am really satisfied. I am concerned for the young children, and I am really worried for their future. Life is too expensive, there is too much unemployment.' Juma Abdalla Athanas, 65: 'My health is the problem, I don't have strength, the way I am getting old. There are different types of old people. Those who have money can be taken to the old people's home.' That leaves Abdul Wasay struggling to survive. At 75, the former cook and blacksmith spends most of his day trying to sell toothbrushes and toothpaste on a busy street corner in Kabul's main market. The job nets him just $6 a day — barely enough to support his wife. He can only afford to buy meat twice a month; the family relies mainly on potatoes and curried vegetables. 'It's difficult because my knees are weak and I can't really stand for a long time,' he says. 'But what can I do? It's even harder in winter, but I can't afford treatment.' Although government hospitals are free, Wasay complains that they provide little treatment and hardly any medicine. He wants to stop working in three years, but is not sure his children can support him. He says many older people cannot find work because they are not strong enough to do day labor, and some resort to begging. 'You have to keep working no matter how old you are — no one is rich enough to stop,' he says. 'Life is very difficult.' Many governments have resisted tackling the issue partly because it is viewed as hugely complicated, negative and costly — which is not necessarily true, says Silvia Stefanoni, chief executive of HelpAge International. Japan and Germany, she says, have among the highest proportions of elders in the world, but also boast steady economies. 'There's no evidence that an aging population is a population that is economically damaged,' she says. Claudio Rodriguez Contreras, 71: 'Cuban elderly have no biggest fears of old age, as our revolutionary government within its means helps us with minimal requirements - a pension, free medical care, food, home, and keeps us active in society.' Paul Gresham, 75:'I'm not afraid of much but the thing that would upset me the most is if someone took away my car. I realize the day is coming as I continue to have birthdays that I won't be able to drive but that's my freedom.' Prosperity in itself does not guarantee protection for the old. The world's rising economic powers — the so-called BRICS nations of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa — rank lower in the index than some poorer countries such as Uruguay and Panama. However, the report found, wealthy nations are in general better prepared for aging than poorer ones. Sweden, where the pension system is now 100 years old, makes the top of the list because of its social support, education and health coverage, followed by Norway, Germany, the Netherlands and Canada. The United States comes in eighth. Sweden's health system earns praise from Marianne Blomberg, an 80-year-old Stockholm resident. 'The health care system, for me, has worked extraordinarily well,' she says. 'I suffer from atrial fibrillation and from the minute I call emergency until I am discharged, it is absolutely amazing. I can't complain about anything — even the food is good.' Still, even in an elder-friendly country like Sweden, aging is not without its challenges. The Swedish government has suggested people continue working beyond 65, a prospect Blomberg cautiously welcomes but warns should not be a requirement. Blomberg also criticized the nation's finance minister, Anders Borg, for cutting taxes sharply for working Swedes but only marginally for retirees. 'I go to lectures and museums and the theater and those kinds of things, but I probably have to stop that soon because it gets terribly expensive,' she says. 'If you want to be active like me, it is hard. But to sit home and stare at the walls doesn't cost anything.'","Study ranks social and economic well-being of elders in 91 countries .

"Fears: TUC boss Brendan Barber says youth unemployment has reached 'crisis' levels in Britain . A generation of Britons could be left on the scrapheap as one million young people are still out of work, official figures revealed today. The situation is at 'crisis point' as one in five 16 to 25-year-olds cannot find a job and many have been looking for years, unions have said. At least half the one million unemployed youths have been searching for work for six months or more. And as youngsters collect their A-Levels this week they are being warned their future job prospects look bleak in the toughest jobs market for 20 years. Despite a slight fall of 4,000 youngsters dropping off the dole queue in the last three months, TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said: 'If this continues we could lose a generation of talented, highly qualified youngsters to blighted careers, debt and under-achievement. 'Students looking to start their . careers or continue in their education next month are facing the . toughest climate for nearly 20 years. 'It's . particularly worrying that long-term joblessness for young people is . still rising, even as overall unemployment falls. 'The . Government's economic strategy is holding young people back. It's time . for a new plan that invests in their futures, rather than stunting . careers before they've barely begun.' Young people looking for a job or planning to continue in education are facing the toughest outlook since 1992, he added. More than one in five people aged between . 16 and 24 were out of work, significantly higher than in 1992, when the . rate was 16 per cent, he said. While the proportion of young . people in full-time education has almost doubled from 24 per cent in . 1992 to 41 per cent this year. But the Government maintains that they are getting young people into work. Tough: There are one million young people in the dole queue . A . spokesman for Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said: 'This . is nothing but scaremongering from the unions at a very sensitive time. The last Labour government did all they could to manipulate youth . unemployment figures and hide the real picture. 'Youth . unemployment fell last month and there are fewer young people on . Jobseekers Allowance or any other temporary support now than there was . in May 2010. This is still a big challenge and we don't underestimate it . for one moment. Reply: Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan-Smith says that the TUC is 'scaremongering' 'We are . fully committed to helping young people get the skills and experience . they need to get a job. Over the next three years the Youth Contract . will offer nearly 500,000 opportunities for young people through work . experience, apprenticeships and wage subsidies to help them find work.' A survey by the National Union of . Students showed that three out of four youngsters intending to go to . university this autumn are worried about getting a job after they finish . their course. The poll of 800 students also revealed that around two thirds had concerns about finances while they studied. NUS . vice president Rachel Wenstone said: 'For many people, a university . degree has traditionally given them the opportunity to access the . employment of their choice. Now those who make it to university are no . longer guaranteed employment in the way that previous generations were. 'Unemployment . amongst graduates is still lower than for those without a degree but . those getting their A-level results this year face harder decisions than . many about their futures.' Paul . Brown, Director, youth charity The Prince's Trust, added: 'There is an . alarming number of unemployed young people who lack the skills and . confidence they need to find work, and it is these young people that . need urgent support.' Overall unemployment fell by 65,000 . between March and May to 2.58 million, although the number of people . claiming jobseeker's allowance in June increased by 6,100 to 1.6 . million. But the drop has been mainly been put down to the Olympics. Jobless rate: Two year figures reveal a recent drop to 8 per cent unemployment . David Kern, Chief Economist at the British Chambers of Commerce , said: 'The latest job market figures are encouraging, and act as a welcome contrast to recent pessimism about the UK economy. Employment is up, unemployment is down, and the rate of inactivity is at its lowest since 1991. 'But there are still areas of concern. Youth unemployment is unacceptably high, and too many people are still being forced to work part-time as they cannot find a full-time job. While unemployment is likely to increase over the next 12-18 months, the peak may now be lower than the 2.9m figure we predicted in our last forecast.'","Youth unemployment figures out today showed one million people aged 16-25 are out of work .

"Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls’s whizzkid younger brother has received a huge City bonus of about £4.5 million. Andrew Balls, a senior executive at bond traders Pimco, is being feted as one of the City’s fastest-rising stars since being promoted to deputy chief investment officer last month. And the latest published figures reveal the scale of his rewards. While his combined annual salary and bonus generally tops £1 million, Andrew was one of seven Pimco directors to share a bonus pot of £57 million in 2012. The Shadow Chancellor's brother Andrew Balls, a senior executive at bond traders Pimco, is being feted as one of the City’s fastest-rising stars since being promoted to deputy chief investment officer last month. The Shadow Chancellor – whose leader Ed Miliband has been highly critical of bankers’ bonuses – will cost his brother dear if Labour win the next Election. His soak-the-rich plan to raise the top rate of tax  from 45p to 50p would cost Andrew at least an extra £45,000 on his average annual earnings – and £225,000 more on the windfall. He would have paid around £2 million on his bonus under the current Conservative regime. But under his big brother’s proposal, he would have to pay about £2.25 million. Andrew, who at 40 is six years  Ed’s junior, enjoys a lifestyle to go with his earnings: he takes holidays in the fashionable Hamptons outside New York, has rented a home from Hollywood star Ewan McGregor and recently bought a £6.5 million ‘Grand Designs’ property in London’s Little Venice. To add insult to injury, Andrew is also said to be a better football player than his brother (above) By contrast, big brother Ed has  to make do with his £65,000 MP’s salary and lives in a terrace house  in Hackney, East London, with his wife and fellow Shadow Cabinet Minister Yvette Cooper. Just to rub it in, one friend of both brothers observed that Andrew is also ‘a better footballer’ than his brother – or at least ‘carries a bit less weight on the pitch’. And he added pointedly: ‘Andrew is also a really nice bloke.’ The income gulf has, according to one of Andrew’s friends, led him  to quip that he should be classified as ‘the UK’s largest political donor’ because of how much he is forced to ‘help [his] brother out’. The gulf has not always been so wide. The Balls brothers initially followed very similar paths. Both were privately educated in Nottingham, went on to become academic stars at Oxford and Harvard, and then worked as economics writers at the Financial Times. Andrew Gowers, the former editor of the Financial Times, who worked with both brothers, has said: ‘More than once I heard [Andrew] referred to as Ed’s clever brother. 'He’s a modest, cerebral guy, without the pointy elbows of his brother.’ Mr Gowers added that Andrew ‘always had a modest way of putting his views across’ and was ‘more interested in finding the truth about economics and markets’. Ed switched to politics in the mid-1990s and Andrew went on to become one of the top earners now being targeted by the Shadow Chancellor. Andrew’s rising profile in the City has caused political embarrassment for Ed. In May 2010, while Ed was in the Cabinet, Pimco declared it had begun selling off UK Government debt – effectively a vote of no confidence in the Government’s economic policies. Andrew was the company’s head of European investment. One mutual friend said of the earnings gap last night: ‘It’s a bit galling for Ed. Both are clever boys, and you could argue Ed has more power, but no one likes to be outstripped by their younger siblings.’","Andrew Balls is a senior executive at bond traders Pimco .

"Darren Vann, 43, (pictured)  allegedly confessed to killing seven women in Indian, but refused to speak in court . A man who allegedly confessed to killing seven women in Indiana refused to respond to the judge during his initial court appearance, prompting her to warn him he'd spend 'the rest of his life' in jail unless he cooperates. When the judge asked Darren Vann, 43, if he swore to tell the truth at his initial court appearance in the strangulation death of 19-year-old Afrikka Hardy, he didn't respond or flinch and stood unmoving and stone-faced. He has been charged with the murder of Hardy and 35-year-old Anith Jones, whose body was found in Gary on Saturday. Lake Superior Court judge Kathleen Sullivan warned Vann, who stood with his wrists and legs shackled and flanked by two jail guards, he could be held in contempt and he still declined to speak. 'Mr. Vann, are you choosing not to take part in this hearing?' Sullivan asked Vann during the hearing in a courtroom at the Lake County Jail in Crown Point. Sullivan then addressed Vann's public defender, urging him to make his client speak. 'Tell your client that he stays in jail the rest of his life until this hearing takes place,' she said. Vann's public defender walked up to him and put his hand on Vann's shoulder encouraging him to speak, but he refused. The judge ordered that Vann should be held in contempt of court and said she would schedule another initial hearing for next week. Vann, a convicted sex offender, is charged with the strangulation death of Hardy, whose body was found Friday in a bathtub at a Motel 6 in Hammond, 20 miles southeast of Chicago. Authorities said Hardy was involved in prostitution and had arranged to meet Vann at the motel through a Chicago-area website. Scroll down for video . Victims: Police in Gary, Indiana, named Anith Jones, 35, (right) as one of the deceased and Afrikka Hardy (left) as another of the seven found so far . Teaira Batey, 28,  (pictured) was identified by Hammond Police Chief John Doughty as one of the women killed . Police arrested him Saturday in Hardy's death after obtaining a search warrant for Vann's vehicle and home in nearby Gary. After his arrest, investigators say Vann directed them to the bodies of six other women in Gary whom he also confessed to killing. More charges are likely. Officers found the body of 35-year-old Anith Jones, of Merrillville, Indiana, on Saturday night in an abandoned home. She had been missing since Oct. 8. Five more bodies were found Sunday in other homes, said Hammond Police Chief John Doughty, who identified two of the women as Gary residents Teaira Batey, 28, and Kristine Williams, 36. Police have not determined the identities of the other three women, including two whose bodies were found on the same block where Jones' body was found Saturday. Investigators in Indiana and Texas, where he has also lived and served prison time, have been looking over cold case files and missing person reports to determine if there are more victims. They have also been using Vann's phone records to pinpoint his movements after he told police he liked to check on the status of bodies he'd previously stashed after a fresh kill, authorities said. Anith Jones of Merrillville, Indianna (pictured) whose body was found October 18  in an abandoned home . Vann was convicted in 2009 of raping a woman in his Austin, Texas, apartment. He was released from prison last year and moved back to Indiana. Before that conviction, he served a year in prison in Indiana after he grabbed a Gary woman in a chokehold in 2004, doused her with gasoline and threatened to set her on fire. In both the Texas and Indiana cases, the charges against Vann were reduced in plea bargains, and Texas officials deemed him a low risk for violence. Vann registered as a sex offender in Indiana and police made a routine check in September that he lived at the address he provided.

"Nabbed: Michael Brewster, 54, of Pensacola, Fla. was arrested on Thursday after pulled over for running a stop sign in Oklahoma in what they'd discovered was a stolen SUV . The suspected 'bucket list bandit' who robbed at least 10 banks during a near three month road trip across the U.S. was arrested after running a stop sign in Oklahoma. Police in Roland said Michael Eugene Brewster, 54, who got his name by telling bank tellers he only had four months to live, was nabbed after his vehicle was found reported stolen in Florida while re-marked with Utah license plates. As ABC reports Brewster was evicted from his Pensacola apartment in Florida on June 14, seven days before appearing in Colorado where he hit his first bank. From there he went on an 85-day trip around the country while only until now, according to at least one crime expert speaking to ABC, amazingly getting away with his crimes. 'The fact that this guy committed not one…but a total of 10 bank robberies is a little startling,' said law enforcement expert and crime analyst Rod Wheeler. 'And the fact that he got away with these crimes is even more startling.' Brewster's arrest on Thursday came three days after his most recent heist at a Huntington National Bank in Erie Pennsylvania bank where he was recognized by his blue polo shirt, grim prognosis, and warning of being armed. Following that robbery a massive search went out for the man, plastering his face on billboards, TV stations, posters and the internet. He was connected to the robberies after a confidential informant gave the FBI Brewster's name and birth date presumably after spotting him on a wanted poster the FBI had released. 'On September 12, 2012, a Contributor of Information (COI) telephonically contacted the FBI-Erie office and identified Michael Eugene Brewster as the 'Bucket List Bandit,'' Erie FBI Special Agent Kirk R. Brace said. According to the Erie Times News, just days earlier on September 10 he . approached a female teller and handed her a piece of paper containing . instructions in which he demanded $5,000 in a bag, that he had a gun but . did not want to use it, that she had a minute to comply.

Brewster during robberies in Missouri, Colorado, Arizona, Idaho, Utah, . North Carolina, Tennessee and Illinois. The black Chevy Captiva, which the man is accused of borrowing from a woman on June 11 and not returning it, is similar to the vehicles seen by witnesses at several of the 'Bucket List Bandit' bank heists. Tipster: The FBI launched a massive hunt for the man who claimed to have just months to live and 'didn't care' leading to a tipster's aid in identifying him . Scene: The last bank to be robbed, making at least 10 by the same bandit, was this Huntington branch bank in Erie, Pennsylvania on Monday . Before he held up the Erie bank, Brewster's most recent robberies have been in St Louis and Columbia, Missouri. Prior to that he has struck in Colorado, Arizona, Idaho, Utah, North Carolina, Tennessee and Illinois. The robber usually wears the same blue polo shirt and jeans for his robberies. He also has a gray mustache and wears glasses. The bandit typically walks into a bank alone and hands the teller a demand note. It isn't clear whether he needed the . money for medical care or for spending during his . final few months. 'It's not uncommon for a robber to . just want to get in and get out,' said Rebecca Wu, a spokeswoman from . the FBI St Louis division, in an interview with Fox News. 'They generally want to draw as little attention to themselves as possible.' No one was hurt in any of the robberies and officials have not revealed how much money has been stolen. In some of the crimes the robber has implied that he has a weapon, but has never shown one. The FBI was planning to use digital billboards in the eight states where the bandit struck to display images of the man to help them track him down. Watch the video here: .

"Employers across the US are cutting hours for workers in order to avoid paying for their health insurance. Under the Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as Obamacare, companies with more than 50 employees are required to offer health insurance to staff working over 30 hours per week. This will hit low-paid workers on hourly wages the hardest as they fear smaller pay checks, as well as higher health premiums. Forever 21-hours: The clothing chain announced that it will make cuts to benefits and pay for hundreds of its employees in a staff memo leaked in August to keep them under the 30-hour mark . As several companies deny that the new legislation has been a factor in their decision to cut hours, many workers now fear a double hit on both pay and benefits. The legislation, said to be behind today's government shutdown, will see companies face a fine of $2,000 per full-time employee lest they pay for their health cover. The Affordable Care Act, a health reform commonly referred to as Obamacare, opens for enrollment today and comes into force on January, 2014. As a result, many companies are looking for a way to avoid both health payments and fines and have simply slashed hours for their employees. These include international high-street clothing brand Forever 21, which will cut hours for hundreds of their employees according to a leaked staff memo, and grocery chain Trader Joe's which will cut benefits for all employees working less than 30 hours a week, replacing it with a $500 check to pay for coverage. Financial nightmare: President Obama announces the government shutdown caused by the Senate and the House failing to agree on the health care reforms . ‘Depending on income earned outside of Trader Joe’s, we believe that with the $500 from Trader Joe’s and the tax credits available under the ACA, many crew members should be able to obtain health care coverage at very little, if any, net cost,’ the 400-store chain said in a statement last month. Other companies cutting hours and benefits include tourist favourite SeaWorld, logistics giant UPS and multi-national computer firm IBM which announced it will end their health plan for over 100,000 retiring employees. Smaller businesses are following in their footsteps with 50 per cent admitting that they will cut the number of full-time employees or reduce their hours in order to avoid paying for health insurance. In a July survey from the U.S. Chamber of commerce, only 30 per cent of small businesses said they were prepared for Obamacare, LA Times reported. As a result of the ACA, about 27 per cent of small businesses intend to cut hours to reduce full-time employees and 23 per cent plan to replace them will part-time workers. In addition, 24 per cent will reduce the number of staff hired, saying the healthcare bill is their biggest obstacle to hiring more employees, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said. The Democrat heavy Senate’s battle against the Republican majority House of Representatives resulted in a standoff which led to a government shut-down at midnight on Tuesday. Lawmakers in the Democrat-controlled Senate and Republican-controlled Congress failed to pass a budget allowing for the federal government to continue to be funded as it headed into the new fiscal year at midnight. Late-night negotiations ended in deadlock after the Senate Democrats refused to consider any version of the budget that included changes to President Obama's signature health care law. This lack of compromise means that nearly a million federal workers will go on unpaid leave until the two legislative bodies come to an agreement.","Nationwide companies are cutting hours for workers to avoid payments .

"Lauren Reid was left with a nasty wound on her arm and was hospitalised for four days after she was bitten by a spider in her sleep . A woman has told of her horror after she was hospitalised for four days and suffered paralysis following a spider bite in her sleep. Lauren Reid was left with a pus-filled hole in her arm after the arachnid attacked her in her home in Kingstanding, Birmingham. The 21-year-old temporarily lost the use of her left limb as the creature's venom spread through her body. Experts are still analysing what type of spider may have caused the injury, with tests due to come back next month. Describing the October 20 attack, Ms Reid said: 'I was in my bedroom asleep when I felt something crawl across my left arm. 'I pushed it off and noticed something sticking out my arm. It looked like a thick black hair. I pulled it out, cleaned it up and went back to sleep.' But by the time she woke up in the morning, the initially small, red mark on her arm had swollen to a huge lump. She visited her doctor, who prescribed antibiotics and explained the wound looked like an abscess. Ms Reid said: 'I was in an unbelievable amount of pain. My arm was paralysed and stuck in an upwards position. If I tried to move it, it felt as though my arm would rip off.' The admin worker also suffered sickness, drowsiness and hot and cold flushes and was told it may take a few days for the antibiotics to take effect. She said: 'My arm felt really hot and I had shooting pains. Eventually my friend told me we should go to A&E. She was that worried. 'When we arrived, the doctors looked stumped. I don't think they had seen anything like it, which was really scary.' When things did not get better, she was admitted to hospital and stayed there for four days, being treated with intravenous antibiotics. She added: 'I think if I hadn't listened to my friend and gone to hospital, I may have had to have my arm amputated. 'I was deteriorating very quickly. I'm back home now, but I don't even want to go to sleep in my bedroom. I'm shaking now just thinking about it. I'm scared to be on my own.' The bite has left Ms Reid with a large wound on her left arm, which was pussing after the spider bit her .","Admin worker went to bed as normal at her home in Birmingham this month .

"Rail passengers took a step back in time today as they boarded a 19th Century steam train on the London Underground to mark the 150th anniversary of the first Tube journey in the capital. Selected passengers moved off from Kensington Olympia Tube station in west London aboard a train pulled by Met Locomotive 1, which was built in 1898. The first stretch of the world-famous network opened on January 9 1863 - between Paddington and Farringdon - when it was known as the Metropolitan Railway. Scroll down for video .

Spectators at Underground stations were covered in steam as the train made its way along the same track used by modern day Tube services. Mayor of London Boris Johnson, who was onboard, said: 'It was just extraordinary. We had steam coming in through the windows, huge thick clouds of white steam going past and then bits of soot coming through from the engine. 'It was fascinating, as the train started to go up from Kensington to Notting Hill you could feel the engine really strain, but as we levelled off it picked up a lot of speed. You could see how the Victorians were able to run a very timely service.' He added: 'It was romantic. You understand all those Victorian novels and the assignations that possibly took place on those velvet seats. It was pure Conan Doyle.'

Mount St Joseph freshman Lauren Hill, 19, was diagnosed last year with an inoperable brain tumor and was told she had years to live.

NBC Sports reports that Mount St Joseph's had trouble with the practice drills for the first play they were planning for the game. When they finally ran it for real, it all ran smoothly, with Hill finishing under the basket where sank a layup to put Mount St Joseph on the board. Hill is the last person trying to focus on her condition, though, saying to an interviewer, 'Let’s not call it my last game. This is my first collegiate game.' She was awarded the USBWA Pat Summitt Most Courageous Award at halftime as Summitt, the coach with the most ever wins in NCAA basketball, stood by her. 'I never gave up for a second even when I got a terminal diagnosis; never thought about sitting back and not living life anymore,' Hill told Local 12 before the game.

"He is not the first multimillionaire to quit the world of commerce and vow to give his entire fortune to charity. But few can have put their money where their mouth is with such conviction as Brian Burnie. Once the owner of a £16million mansion, the 70-year-old now lives off his pension in a small flat and drives a battered Ford Fiesta. Scroll down for video . Shirley and Brian Burnie divorced in 2012 after the 70-year-old businessman sold their 10-acre estate (pictured) and all of their belongings when his wife was given the all-clear from breast cancer . The former recruitment firm boss pledged to dedicate his life to . helping women with breast cancer after his wife was diagnosed with the . disease. But it emerged yesterday that the couple divorced after . Shirley, his wife of almost 30 years, grew fed up with his addiction to . parting with everything the family had worked for. ‘I didn’t . intend to have to beat cancer and then spend the rest of my life living . in a house like this and doing everything for everyone else,’ said Mrs . Burnie, 66, who made a full recovery. ‘I’m sick of bloody charity and . the hard work – we all are. I didn’t want to give everything away. We . needed a home and an income and we have three children. I wanted . security for us and our family.’ Born in a Newcastle bedsit, Mr . Burnie grew up in a home without an indoor toilet and began working life . as a grocery delivery boy aged 15. After building successful . businesses in construction and recruitment, he turned his ten-acre . Northumberland estate into a £16million luxury hotel and spa. But . following his wife’s diagnosis a decade ago, Mr Burnie began to focus . on charity. It was not a total surprise – at their wedding in 1981, he . insisted they ask for donations to charity instead of presents. Mrs Burnie said she became fed up with her husband caring more about the charity than their financial security. The 70-year-old now lives alone in a flat above the charity's headquarters . In 2010 the couple moved into this house in Morpeth, Northumberland, after selling their luxury home . In . 2009, he sold the hotel and used all the proceeds to fund a fleet of . cars ferrying rural patients to hospital – as part of his charity, Daft . As A Brush. Announcing they needed somewhere more ‘modern and . easy to look after’, he shocked friends  and former employees by moving . his family to a tiny rented terraced house opposite a council estate  in . nearby Morpeth, insisting: ‘I’ve no interest in bricks and mortar.’ But . there were signs his outwardly loyal wife was unhappy with the drastic . change in lifestyle when he was persuaded to move them to a pretty stone . house backing on to farmland. Mrs Burnie hoped her husband’s . retirement would allow them to spend more time together, but she said . the ‘madness’ of devoting his life to helping others meant he was . working 12 hours a day and barely seeing his family. ‘It took over his life, becoming more important than anything else to him,’ she added yesterday. ‘I . said to him often that we had other things to consider, but his top . three priorities were the charity, the charity and the charity.’ In . 2011, she learned from someone at a hairdresser’s that her husband had . bought a home in Gosforth, Newcastle, without telling her. ‘I felt he’d made his preparations for the end of the marriage and waited for me to find out,’ she said. Shortly . afterwards, according to Mrs Burnie, he told her the marriage was over, . moving into a flat above the charity’s offices. The couple divorced in . 2012. But Mr Burnie denies he wanted to end the relationship and . maintains there was nothing sinister about the house purchase, saying: . ‘I never intended to live in it. I bought it for the charity.’ He still . sees his grown-up children regularly, but they will not get a penny from . him. ‘I had enough money to set them up for life, but I think . that would be wrong,’ he said. ‘Your children have to make their own . way. Mr Burnie features in Channel 4’s documentary Jon Richardson . Grows Up, tonight at 10.35pm. There is no mention of the couple’s split, . though it does show him living alone in his flat.

"A couple who fell in love as teenagers but lost touch during the Second World War are finally set to marry - eight decades after they first met as children.

But the pair recently got back in touch - and Mrs Bluett moved to Pawlett, Somerset, to marry him. Mr Humphries said: ‘I suppose the important thing is - the meaning of all this really - is that we met all those years ago and it must have really left some sort of impression. ‘And when circumstances brought us closer together we finally got married after all these years. It has been quite stressful but I am looking forward to it.’ The pair met when Mr Humphries’s family, who were from London, visited Mrs Bluett’s village of Appledore, North Devon, for family holidays. She said: ‘I used to tease him mercifully. I don't know why, it was a sort of challenge I think. But then I saw him when I was 17, and he was 18, and he was this handsome soldier in khakis. 'The hormones were running wild. I thought “I'm going to marry that man one day”, but I never said a word to anyone.’ Old times: Mr Humphries (left) joined the army and Mrs Bluett (right) enlisted in the RAF during the war - and although he penned love letters to his sweetheart, they were never passed on by her protective parents .

"The billionaire Paul G. Allen said on Thursday that he would donate $100 million to the fight against Ebola, which has killed almost 5,000 people so far and crippled Western Africa. Billionaire Paul Allen says he'll contribute at least $100 million to the fight against Ebola. The Microsoft co-founder said Thursday that among the initiatives he's supporting is the development of two medevac containment units that the U.S. State Department can use to safely evacuate health workers who become infected. Allen, who is worth more than $15billion, said he's working with the World Health Organization to increase its capacity for handling the logistics of transporting international aid workers, and he's establishing a fund to help cover the costs of emergency transportation of the workers. Money will also go to the University of Massachusetts Medical School to help provide decontamination and lab equipment to Liberian hospitals, as well as community outreach and education in Liberia. Allen's foundation previously pledged $26.5 million. He's urging people to give to the cause at www.tackleebola.com. The website aims to direct small donors to projects that need financing, like 6,000 hand-washing stations or beds for a center treating patients infected with the virus, and he is underwriting the administrative costs of the highlighted projects. He also donated $2.8 million to the American Red Cross for its work on the outbreak. The gift to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention comes at a time when international groups, including Doctors Without Borders and the World Health Organization, have said resources to contain the epidemic and treat those affected are falling tragically short. Fears: . The Ebola virus has killed more than 4,800 people in Guinea, Liberia, . Sierra Leone and Nigeria this year in the largest outbreak of the . disease ever.  Above, a health worker sprays a man believed to be dying . from the virus with disinfectant chemicals  in Liberia . Allen's donation joins that of the Bill and Melinda . Gates Foundation, which has pledged $50 million to United Nations agencies and . other international groups to purchase supplies, such as protective gear . for healthcare workers treating Ebola patients, and to expand the . emergency response. Allen said the donation from the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation will help CDC establish emergency operations centers in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, where the worst Ebola outbreak on record has killed about 2,300 people and shows no sign of slowing six months after it began. Allen said his foundation's gift would help CDC establish and equip emergency operations centers in the three most-affected countries, focusing on public health, not patient care. The centers will use 'data management and communication systems for disease and patient contact tracing, to detect and stop the disease from spreading,' Allen said. They will also expand lab testing to identify new outbreaks, and disseminate information about the epidemic to the public. 'A winnable battle should never be lost,' Allen said. Health workers in West Africa use protective gear while dealing with patients infected with the Ebola virus . This map from the World Health Organization shows the countries most affected by the Ebola outbreak . Health aid workers remove a victim of the fatal Ebola virus while wearing protective gear to avoid spreading the disease . 'Everybody feels called sometimes to really pursue a certain thing that resonates with them, and this has resonated with me,' Mr. Allen said. He said when he first began hearing about the Ebola outbreak in July, he had a 'nagging sense' that it could spiral out of control. 'We're up against an extremely tough opponent here,' he said. 'The exponential nature of the growth of this disease is really a challenge — we've already seen in the U.S. where one case quickly became two.' Part of Mr. Allen’s money will go to the University of Massachusetts Medical School to underwrite training, medical workers and lab equipment in Liberia, where the public health system struggles for funding and many district hospitals are closed. The goal is to reopen these medical facilities so they not only can care for victims but also provide routine health care that has been all but abandoned during the crisis. Currently . the virus can only be transmitted through contact with a victim's . bodily fluids, including blood, vomit, diarrhea and other secretions . Back in the day: Paul Allen and Bill Gates founded Microsoft in 1975 and rose to prominence as the personal computer gained a mass following beginning in the '80s . “I got a taste when I was in Kenya a while ago of what medical care was in rural Africa,” Mr. Allen said. “I was in a town of about 10,000 people, and a shipping container with a rusty microscope was their medical clinic.” More of his money will help create a fund at the Silicon Valley Community Foundation designed to cover the gap between what insurance would cover should a medical professional need evacuation and the actual cost. “This is really more about trying to attack every element of this problem,” Mr. Allen said. “This disease expands at an exponential rate, so there is a need for exponentially more health care workers.” Since resigning from Microsoft in 1983, Allen has become a prominent philanthropist, supporting scientific research through the Allen Institute for Brain Science and the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. He has given awa some $1.5 billion of his wealth through a family foundation he established with his sister, Jody. He also owns the Seattle Seahawks football team and the Portland Trail Blazers basketball team.","Co-founder Paul Allen has pledged a donation of $100 million .

"These are the extraordinary century-old panoramic pictures taken by British cameramen who risked their lives to gather intelligence during the First World War. The surveillance images, hailed as some of the most important photographs of the conflict, show never-before-seen views of No Man's Land and important battle sites taken from the trenches of the Western Front. They were taken at huge risk by fearless cameramen - who would lean out of the trenches with crude glass plate equipment to take the images. A collection of panoramic images taken by brave Britons gathering intelligence during the First World War has been revealed. These two images show the same view of The Somme at The Hawthorn Ridge 99 years apart. The location was one of the bloodiest of the entire conflict - and on 1 July 1915, thousands of Lancashire Fusiliers were cut down at the spot. Today the landscape shows nothing of the horrors it once witnessed . The images were taken by British cameramen - who risked their lives to take the pictures. This image shows Canadian troops moving through the ruins of the-once beautiful city of Ypres. By the time this photograph was taken in April 1918, the war was nearing its end - evident by the devastation that is depicted . In this behind-the-scenes image, Lieutenant Osbert Crawford and his assistant prepare to take a picture from a front line trench in the Arras sector in France - a hugely difficult task that would have seen them go over the top of the trench. He used a tripod-mounted 5 x 4 inch Panros camera fitted with a telephoto lens to take the shots . At the time, the panoramas were highly classified because of the information they would have given the enemy. Each was printed with the following warning: 'This panorama is to be kept with as much security as is compatible with full advantage of it being taken by our own troops.' Some of the photographs show the tranquil countryside in the early days of the war, apparently unspoilt but with the enemy positions carefully marked. Others graphically portray the obliteration to the landscape and towns after years of bloody attrition. The images are printed in a new book called Battlefields of the First World War by Peter Barton. These panoramas show the development of defensive positions at The Somme. The first was taken in May 1915 and shows a simple fortification known as a breastwork - which were usually built on the surface and made from sandbags and wood. The second shows the same scene 18 months later in November 1916 and the dramatic increase in fortifications . This image shows the Hooge sector, one of the most blood-drenched corners of the entire Western Front. The image was taken from the heart of the once sylvan and tranquil Hooge Chateau estate in Spring 1916 . This image shows the aftermath of conflict at Passchendaele, Belgium. A long line of soldiers carry duckboards towards new positions and use them to cross the mud and flooded shell craters on the tortured ground . In his foreword, TV historian Richard Holmes says: 'It is wonderful to see these panoramas, unexploited for so long, in print. 'They provide a strong fulcrum for our understanding of the war, for they enable us to link personal accounts and official records to the all-important ground on which battles were fought. 'And, at a human level, they put us eye-deep in hell, looking out across a landscape so familiar to that generation whose endurance and achievement lift my spirits and break my heart.' This dramatic image shows behind the battle lines during the Third Battle of Ypres in 1917. By this point, the war was about to enter its fourth year and the landscapes were devastated almost beyond recognition . An image dated April 1915 shows Hill 60 - an important landmark near Ypres. The photograph shows how close enemy lines were - with the Germans holding the vital upper ground on Hill 60. It also shows some of the black humour that existed - with one part of the British trenches ironically nicknamed Lovers Lane . This view is the Somme front in July 1915, a year before the hell of what became the worst battle in British military history. It shows pastures virtually unmarked by shelling, with leafy and shady woods and copses and buildings of all kinds still standing .","Extraordinary collection of images taken by brave Britons on the Western Front revealed for the first time .

"Every new car sold in Britain will have to have a ‘black box’ device fitted to track drivers’ movements from next year, under plans being imposed by the European Union. Despite serious concerns about privacy and cost, UK ministers admit they are powerless to stop the Big Brother technology being forced on motorists and car makers. The Government believes the gadget, designed to help emergency services find crashed vehicles, will add at least £100 to the cost of vehicles without providing significant safety improvements. The technology contains a mobile phone-like SIM card designed to transmit the vehicle’s location to emergency services. An SOS button near the dashboard allows drivers to call 112 quickly. But officials complained  the scheme could be used by police or insurance companies to monitor motorists’ every move . Officials also fear the scheme, known as eCall, could be used by police or insurance companies to monitor motorists’ every move. The European Commission has ruled that by October next year, all new cars and vans sold across Europe must be fitted with the technology, which contains a mobile phone-like SIM card designed to transmit the vehicle’s location to emergency services in the event of a crash. But The Mail on Sunday has seen official correspondence from the Department of Transport showing the UK’s opposition to the policy, which could lead to the ‘constant tracking’ of vehicles. In a letter to MPs, Transport Minister Robert Goodwill writes: ‘The basis for our opposition is that costs to the UK outweigh the benefits. Concern: Official correspondence from the Department of Transport shows the UK's opposition to the policy. Transport Minister Robert Goodwill (pictured) claims the costs of the device to Britain 'outweigh the benefits' ‘Unfortunately, there is very little support for the UK position and no possibility of blocking this legislation. We are working with other member states to minimise the potential burdens on manufacturers and the potential cost to consumers. ‘With regard to the rules on privacy and data protection, other member states have expressed  similar concerns to us, about the potential for constant tracking of vehicles via the eCall system.’ Emma Carr, of civil liberties group Big Brother Watch, said last night: ‘Motorists will not be comfortable forcibly having a black box installed which is capable of recording and transmitting their exact location when they are driving.’ From March 2018, every new car sold in the EU will legally have to be equipped with eCall technology. This will consist of a 'black box' that detects a crash and automatically calls the emergency services for help. Car manufacturers, including BMW, already include the technology in their latest models (i3 pictured) Some car manufacturers, including BMW and Volvo, already include eCall devices in their latest models. An SOS button near the dashboard, linked to a SIM card, allows drivers to call 999 quickly. And if airbags are deployed it automatically sends a text message to emergency services with the car’s location – as well as its unique vehicle ID number. Voluntary take-up has been low across the industry so the EU ruled all new car models must include eCall from October 1, 2015. Motorists will be unable to switch it off and it will be tested in MoT checks. The EU Parliament voted it through last month and a draft of the law is due to be published next week before it is agreed by the EU Commission. Britain is trying to push back the deadline by two years. The UK also hopes the new text will include assurances on the privacy risks of eCall, which were highlighted in a European Parliament legal report earlier this year. The study said manufacturers will want to include ‘value added services’ for the SOS devices, such as sharing the data with insurers and recovery firms. A separate study by the EU Data Protection Supervisor warns of the ‘potential intrusiveness’ of eCall given that it operates on the same basis as mobile phones and ‘potentially enables the constant collection of the vehicle’s geolocation’. It urges ‘stricter safeguards’ against ‘unlawful’ use of personal data. Brussels insists eCall will save 2,500 lives a year by speeding up emergency services response times.","Under EU plans, every new car sold in UK will have a 'black box' device .

"Saved: Iain Christie, 62, became the first man in the world to receive a liver that was 'kept alive' in a machine which mimics the human body . British inventors have kept a human liver alive outside the body using a new device which mimics a human body. At the moment the organs can mostly only be used for transplants within 14 hours of being removed, if they are kept on ice. But by raising the liver to body temperature, and supplying it with red blood cells, oxygen and nutrients for up to 24 hours, British scientists have found a way of keeping the liver ‘alive’ outside the body. They say the procedure could double the number of organs available for transplant in the UK. Iain Christie, 62, thought he was going to run out of time on the organ donor waiting list. But he became the first man in the world to receive a liver that was ‘kept alive’ in a machine which mimics the human body. If kept cold, a liver can last a maximum of 20 hours, but in practice most surgeons will not wait more than 14 to avoid increasing deterioration. But the inventors of the new device say tests suggest it may keep a liver fresh for up to 72 hours in some cases. Once connected to the machine, the liver functions normally and is less likely to suffer damage that might make it unfit for transplantation. The device is mounted on a supermarket-size trolley which can be wheeled into an ambulance ready to go anywhere a patient needs it. So far two patients at King’s College Hospital, London, have had livers kept alive in this way and both are making excellent recoveries. But it is hoped the device will eventually double the number of liver transplants performed each year in the UK, from 650 to well over 1,000. Currently transplantation depends on preserving donor organs by putting them ‘on ice’ - cooling them to slow their metabolism. But the process may damage the organ, while others are discarded because of oxygen deprivation. It is currently difficult for surgeons to accurately identify organs that are failing to work properly. Pioneering: The doctors from King's College Hospital and Oxford University. The new machine raises the donated liver to body temperature and supplies it with red blood cells, oxygen and nutrients for up to 24 hours . Around one in 20 patients receiving a liver transplant may die as a result while 15 per cent have prolonged stays in hospital. By keeping the organ ticking over in the new device as if it’s in a human body, doctors can test for defects before surgery and even resuscitate poorly functioning livers. The machine was invented by Professor Constantin Coussios of Oxford University’s Department of Engineering Science, and Professor Peter Friend, director of the Oxford Transplant Centre, who are founders of OrganOx, the University spin-out created to develop the technology. Prof Coussios said ‘These first clinical cases confirm that we can support human livers outside the body, keep them alive and functioning on our machine and then, hours later, successfully transplant them into a patient.’ He said it was an ‘extraordinary feat of engineering’ which is completely automated. Once the liver is hooked up to the machine, the user simply presses two buttons for ‘play’ and ‘stop’. He said ‘It was astounding to see an initially cold grey liver flushing with colour within 30 seconds once hooked up to our machine and performing as it would within the body. It even produces bile. Hope: Experts say the procedure could double the number of organs available for transplant in the UK . ‘What was even more amazing was to see the same liver transplanted into a patient who is now walking around. ‘Whilst for these two transplants we only needed to keep the livers alive for up to 10 hours, in other experiments we have shown we can preserve a functioning liver and monitor its function outside the body for periods up to 24 hours.’ Mr Christie, 62, a father of five from Torbay, Devon, was told last May he had only 12-18 months to live after being diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver - and it might take that long to get the right kind of organ. He said ‘The waiting is horrible. You’re waiting for the phone to ring, wondering ‘Are they ever going to call me? Are they ever going to call me?’. Liver transplant surgeon, Wayel Jassem, said the procedure maximises the chances of the recipient having a successful outcome . ‘I feel better than I’ve felt for 10-15 years, even allowing for the pain and wound that’s got to heal. I’m getting better and better day by day. I just feel so alive!’ Consultant liver transplant surgeon Wayel Jassem performed both operations last month at King’s College Hospital. He said ‘For the first time, we now have a device that is designed specifically to give us extra time to test the liver, to help maximise the chances of the recipient having a successful outcome.’ An initial trial of 20 patients is taking place at the hospital, with almost double that number signed up. Prof Friend, who has been working on the device for 15 years, said a European CE mark - a ‘kitemark’ of quality for medical devices - could be granted as early as next year enabling it to be used in NHS hospitals. The cost has not yet been decided. Further trials involving 300 patients will test it against conventional treatment and see how much it can improve poor quality organs, he added. It might lead to the number of transplants doubling in the near future, he said. ‘Transplant surgery is a victim of its own success with far more people needing transplants than there are donor organs available. ‘This device has the potential to change that situation radically. ‘By enabling us to transplant many organs that are unusable with current techniques, this technology could bring benefit to a large number of patients awaiting transplants, many of whom currently die whilst still waiting’ he said. The Oxford team believes the technology could be adapted to suit a range of other organs, other than the heart, including the pancreas, kidney, small bowel and lungs.","Currently, organs must be kept on ice and used within 14 hours of removal .

"'You know, my consultant keeps telling me death could come at any moment,’ Sir John Tavener told an interviewer two weeks ago. He laughed as he said it, because Tavener - undoubtedly one of the leading British composers of the past century - had been cheating death for more than three decades. Since June 1980, in fact, when a stroke hit him while driving one of his beloved Rolls-Royces back from the Aldeburgh Festival in Suffolk. The Lord's Tavener: His work reflected a deep religious belief . It temporarily damaged his left arm and hand, and his vocal cords were permanently impaired. But he battled on, enduring several major heart operations, until this week the death he had avoided for so long finally claimed him. I had hoped to see him this weekend at the premiere of three new choral pieces to be given at Southwark Cathedral, but alas it is not to be. The recital by an Icelandic choir will continue as a tribute. John Tavener, who died at 69, was hugely tall - 6ft 6in - and extremely thin, with long bony arms. He suffered from Marfan Syndrome, a genetic disorder which attacks the heart, and which affects some people with that body shape. His health had been in terminal decline for months - he had to take 15 pills a day for years. But he kept working, regarding his afflictions as a test of his profound religious belief, which dominated his life and entire creative thinking. My friend John Suchet, Classic FM’s morning presenter, described to me yesterday how he was speaking at an arts festival in Dorset last June about his favourite subject, Beethoven, when he was astonished to see John Tavener wheeled in by his devoted wife Maryanna. Early fans: Sir John, pictured here with Sir Paul McCartney, was a friend of the Beatles and released an early work called The Whale on their Apple record label . John rushed over to speak to him. Tavener’s first question was typical: ‘Was Beethoven religious?’ John replied there was no evidence Beethoven went to church of his own volition, but his later music reveals a deep spirituality, perhaps arising out of his own suffering. Tavener nodded; he knew better than anyone what suffering does to the creative spirit. Some it destroys; others it enhances. And I profoundly believe that physical suffering was the making of John Tavener as a composer. For he was a man unrecognisable for the past three decades from the show-off I first encountered in an apartment adjacent to the Dorchester hotel in the late Sixties. Then in his early 20s, Tavener was kitted out in velvet, looking like a cross between Wilde and Byron. And it was hard, at first glance, to know on which side of the sexual fence he had placed himself. But since he was going out with the sister of my hostess, Arianna Stassinopoulos - later the founder of the Huffington Post website - I, not without some hesitation, inclined towards the Byronic. Royal approval: Sir John was also a friend of Prince Charles - the two are pictured here together in 1998 after a Tavener concert at St Paul's Cathedral . Raised in a Presbyterian family - which ran a building firm - in  Wembley Park, North-West London, he had won a music scholarship to Highgate School before studying at the Royal College of Music. At the time we met, he had just enjoyed a huge success with The Whale, a bizarre cantata filled with all manner of curious electronic effects, that had so impressed The Beatles, they paid to have it recorded on their new Apple label. Tavener had befriended Ringo Starr after the composer’s brother had done renovation work on the drummer’s house. Ringo introduced Tavener to John Lennon, who was very taken by a recital the slender musician gave him of an opera he had written. It was this unlikely association that led Apple to release The Whale in 1968 - which featured Ringo yelling through a loud-hailer. Spiritual: Sir John finally found peace and fulfillment in the Greek Orthodox Church . (Tavener himself credited Ringo as being largely responsible for the release of The Whale and another Apple album, Celtic Requiem.) This, then, was the man I encountered at that party: with his long, flowing blond locks, and beautiful, monk-like visage, he was quite the cat’s whiskers, and preened himself like a prize-winning Persian pussy. Being myself then a scrofulous undergraduate who thought charisma was December 25, I can tell you I resented him like mad. A few years after that evening, in November 1974, Tavener married a young Greek dancer called Victoria Maragopoulou, who had been training at the Royal Ballet School. Though the composer’s father bought the couple a house in North-West London, Tavener refused to move away from his mother. Muse: In 1991 Sir John married Maryanna Schaefer, whom he had met when she was just 20. The couple are pictured here in 1998 . It was an unhappy union, and just eight months later they parted. Incredibly, the marriage appears to have been unconsummated - and was annulled. Years later Tavener, said cryptically: ‘I matured very quickly in some ways, very slowly in others. I think I’ll leave it at that.’ Despite this, he developed a reputation as a playboy - largely because he liked to drive a Rolls and mix with famous people. At one point he escorted the actress Mia Farrow, and befriended Prince Charles. In a 1995 biography, he was described as having an obsession with charismatic older women - and a penchant for nubile ‘Muses’ in their 20s. Recognition: Sir John was knighted in 2000 for services to music . It was in 1991 that he married again, to Maryanna Schaefer, whom he had first encountered six years before when she was just 20. In one interview, Tavener revealed he married her only on the condition they had no children. Yet she proceeded to do just that. ‘Yes. She slipped them in,’ he admitted with a smile. He had been ‘terrified’ that having children would ruin his creativity, but confessed that despite the hurly-burly of family life - he and Maryanna had a son and two daughters - he ‘just carried on writing’. And carry on writing he did. In 1997, his Song For Athene was played at Princess Diana’s funeral - he later said it was the only good piece played that day. For my part, the scales really fell from my eyes where Tavener is concerned more than two decades after I met him, when I put on a new recording by that master cellist Steven Isserlis of a new piece by Tavener called The Protecting Veil. In it, the cello plays continuously at the top of its range throughout this extraordinary 45-minute meditation. The music has an intensity, an ecstatic brilliance, that could have been composed only by a genius, which is what I now profoundly believe Tavener to have been. Sadly, I had little or no chance to follow up on that memorable meeting years before. Had I done so, I dare say I would have recognised a very different man from the self-adoring figure I had encountered. For Tavener, life was a spiritual journey. Though he never quite abandoned his love of opulent cars, French restaurants and red wine. ‘Every time I have a hit, I buy a Rolls,’ he once quipped. His journey towards spiritual truth began as a teenage organist in a London Presbyterian church, and finally brought him peace and fulfilment in the Greek Orthodox Church. On stage: Sir John received a lifetime achievement award at the 35th International Istanbul Music Festival in Turkey . His profound religious sense was coupled with a range of often extreme and deeply eccentric opinions. In interviews, he would always sound a bit odd, because he probably was in truth pretty odd. ‘I feel a connection with pine trees,’ he told a recent interviewer, straight faced. Genius: When composing, Sir John said he went into 'another world, another state' And his view that serious music ended when it stopped being created for God, was, to put it mildly, eccentric in the extreme. Happily he lived to repent of that, telling John Suchet about the joy he derived from Beethoven, and other 19th-century composers whom he had once dismissed. For him, his work was his salvation. And his faith allowed him to work with great intensity. When composing, he said, he went into ‘another world, another state’. Everything he produced apparently required no rewrites, as if he was a chosen instrument through which heavenly sounds were transmitted. His faith also gave him the forbearance to endure the endless criticism his music received: Too eclectic... no discernible development...   ‘Holy mush’... Tavener probably saw that one as a compliment. While writing this, I have spent an agreeable couple of hours listening to some of Tavener’s finest achievements. I emerge confirmed in my view of his stature, and feeling cleansed by the experience. This is surely the heart of his appeal. His music is not always sophisticated, but it is totally sincere. Its sense of religious certainty appeals even to those like myself who are not formally religious. All of us long for a spiritual dimension in our lives, and Tavener’s music provides it. Not only that, anyone with a musical sense can appreciate it. He certainly wasn’t one of those contemporary composers who thinks if his music is popular, it can’t be any good. Many years ago, Benjamin Britten - an early fan of Tavener - got the younger composer absolutely right. ‘He adores the past, and he builds on the past,’ Britten wrote. I am sad that Tavener is gone, and deeply distressed at all he had to endure for so long. But it made him the composer he became. He leaves behind a formidable body of work, one I believe will last. He observed that: ‘I can look back over [my] work and say I’m not ashamed of it. That’s a good feeling.’ I would argue he is part of that great European choral tradition that flourished in the 15th and 16th centuries. This unique and fascinating man would have looked for no higher praise than that.","David Mellor met Sir John when the composer was in his early 20s .

"Australian military aircraft will start flying support operations over Iraq from Wednesday, Prime Minister Tony Abbott says.

'Australian aircraft from today will start flying over Iraq in support of allied operations,' he told parliament. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister Tony Abbott tells parliament Australian military aircraft will start flying support operations over Iraq from Wednesday . F/A-18F Super Hornet aircrew head to their aircraft in preparation for departure to the Middle East from RAAF Base Amberley last week in Amberley, Australia . 'Ours are support operations, not strike missions. 'Australian air strikes await final clearances from the Iraqi government and a further decision by our own.' He said international security and Australia's national security were 'indivisible'. This comes days after RAAF aircraft conducted their first training missions in the Middle East region. Defence said F/A-18F Super Hornets, an E-7A Wedgetail airborne early warning and control aircraft and KC-30A airborne refueler all conducted preliminary flights from Australia's Middle East base on Sunday. That was aimed at familiarising aircrew of the Air Task Group with local conditions and coalition procedures so they can operate in the coalition command and control network. These missions will continue this week. The government  hasn't said yet whether IS would be targeted in Syria as well as Iraq. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said any decision on a combat role should not be rushed. 'We support the government taking the time to get it right,' he said. RAAF aircraft set to participate in attacks on Islamic State  jihadists have conducted their first training missions in the Middle East region . He reiterated the four conditions behind the opposition's support for the government on a potential combat role. Labor's support does not extend to ground combat forces and is only confined to Iraq, not Syria. Mr Shorten also welcomed work on the legal and diplomatic framework under way to support Australia's Iraq operations. He offered support to the 600 Australian Defence Force personnel stationed in the Middle East. 'We wish them a safe and successful mission and a speedy return to the ones they love.' All aircraft in the Air Task Group are conducting their first ever combat deployments. The Super Hornets can conduct precision strikes against IS ground units and supply lines in support of Iraqi and Kurdish forces. The Wedgetail, regarded as the most advanced aircraft of its type in the world, can coordinate movement of coalition aircraft in what's likely to be very crowded airspace over the battlefield. Australia's tanker aircraft will contribute to the air campaign by refueling coalition aircraft, allowing extended missions. A 200-strong ground force, including special forces, stands ready to advise security forces inside Iraq.","Australian military aircraft will start flying support operations over Iraq from Wednesday .

Hawthorne Police Lt Scott Swain said that officers were warning Rosby to turn down the music in his car. 'It's distracting the officers. It's interfering with what they are able to hear,' Lt Swain said. 'It's not just a party call. It's an armed robbery call. The officers need to hear what's going on with the people being called out of the residence. That music in his car is bleeding over and it's distracting them.' A neighbor who witnessed the event said they heard Rosby yell 'It's my (expletive) radio!' to officers. But Rosby said that didn't happen because as a Christian he doesn't swear. 'I do apologize if I didn't immediately comply,' Rosby said. 'The music may have been a little loud but I was complying.' Watchdog: Rosby was out walking his dog when he came across a police scene and started taking video to make sure civil liberties weren't being . Noise complaint: A Hawthorne Police spokesman said that officers were telling Rosby to turn down his music, which was distracting for those trying to work on the scene . Leaving: Police are seen approaching Rosby as he puts Max in the car, where the windows are rolled down . Eventually the two officers start . walking towards Rosby, who puts Max into his car where the windows are . rolled down. Rosby seems to calmly walk over to the officers and turn . around, volunteering himself for arrest. As the officers put handcuffs on Rosby, the dog starts barking and manages to jump out of the car. Another police officer comes over and looks like he's trying to grab the leash when the dog jumps up and the officer shoots him several times. Turning himself in: Rosby walks over to the officers, turns around, and allows them to handcuff him . Escape: Max beings to bark as his owner is walked towards the squad cars, and he manages to squeeze out the windows . Attack? Another officer comes over and seems to reach for the dog's leash when Max jumps - that's when the shooting starts . Dead: The officer continues to shoot the dog several times. A police spokesman says they were protecting Rosby too . 'He literally killed my puppy I had since he was 6 weeks old,' Rosby said. In the video, Rosby is noticeably upset. 'I was crying and hollering, ""My dog! Max! Max!""' Rosby doesn't understand why police didn't let him go to properly secure his dog, or why they continued to arrest him after he put the dog in the car - a sign that he was leaving. 'There was no way Max should have died like that,' Rosby said. 'Max was only protecting his master. He was trying to stop them from beating on me.' 'All he did was love me,' he added. Lt Swain, however, alleges that the officers were also looking out for Rosby. 'I know it's the dog's master, and more than likely not going to attack him, (but) we've got a guy handcuffed that's kind of defenseless. We have a duty to defend him too,' Swain said. Rosby was held overnight in jail on suspicion of obstruction of justice and released at 5 AM the next day. Rosby says that police would not return his dog's body to him. His attorney Michael Gulden says that Rosby is planning on filing a lawsuit against the Hawthorne Police Department. Dog shot: Rosby's lawyer says they are planning on filing a suit against the police department for the dog's killing . Apparently this isn't the first time that Rosby has had issues with the local police. His prior record includes convictions for resisting arrest, battery and driving under the influence. Rosby, a black man, has filed six complaints alleging mistreatment and racial profiling by the Hawthorn Police. 'There's been a pattern of harassment against him and other African-Americans in Hawthorne. Last July, the police responded to his home and beat him unnecessarily, then threw him in jail for no reason. We sued for that. We'll amend that complaint to include the dog incident,' Gulden said. As of Monday night, the video had 510 views and almost 400 comments.","Leon Rosby, 52, was walking his dog and video-tapping a police scene when he was arrested for obstruction of justice .

"While I love being brown, I hate getting a fake tan. Having to book a salon appointment the day before a big event, spending the rest of it looking as though I've been dipped in mud, reeking of that peculiar biscuity smell - there's nothing worse. So when Fake Bake announced they'd developed the 60 Minute Tan, which can be washed off after just an hour when most demand you sit around for at least four, I was intrigued - especially given the recent storms that have stolen our summer sun. Get out of bed! You can avoid the tanning bed and long spray-tan sessions with Fake Bake's 60-minute tan . 'With fake tan, the commonly used chemicals, such as dihydroxyacetone, are activated upon contact with the skin to turn it brown,' says Victoria Halliday, UK Manager for Fake Bake At Home. 'But the 60 Minute Tan contains cutting-edge accelerators, meaning it develops within an hour and won't smell. You can take a shower after this and go out. It also contains a unique ingredient, which is activated when water hits the skin, so the shade continues to darken.' It almost sounds too good to be true. While you can buy the product to apply yourself (£24.95), I decided to leave it to the professionals. The company has more than 2,000 qualified therapists nationwide (find your nearest at fakebake.co.uk) who, for £25, will come to your house, set up their equipment and tan you. Golden success: Fake Bake lives up to the hype . It's far cheaper than a salon and you don't have to suffer the humiliation of staggering home afterwards looking like an Oompa Loompa. Emma Edwards, owns the TLC salon in Trowbridge, and is 20 minutes from my Somerset home. She arrives with a large black pop-up tent, which she erects in seconds in my kitchen. I stand wearing nothing but a pair of paper pants while she sprays me up and down with the brown liquid, starting with my arms, then moving on to my legs, bottom, back and finally face. The same nozzle is then used to blow warm air to dry my tan. In all, it takes just five minutes. When she's finished, I look down enchanted at my smooth brown body. My eyes appear brighter, my face healthier and I look half a stone lighter - and I don't smell. I potter around the kitchen for an hour in my dressing gown, waiting for 60 minutes to elapse. When I stand under the shower, the water runs such a dark brown that I am convinced that my fake tan has washed off. But to my amazement, I emerge looking as though I've spent the summer on a tropical beach. When I take a quick nap, risking pristine white bed linen to see if their claim that the tan won't rub off on anything is true, the sheets stay spotless. And at bedtime I scrutinise my white t-shirt and pale jeans.  There isn't a smudge on either. My one-hour tan has been a golden success. It's not just advances in speed that are . improving fake tans. 'The tanning market really has produced a tan for . every occasion,' says Fake Bake's Victoria Halliday.

"One teen's boredom lead to a beloved police officer's death today after the 16-year-old boy lit a mattress on fire in a Brooklyn apartment building on Sunday and severely scalded two police officers. NYPD housing officer Dennis Guerra, a 38-year-old father of four died before 7 a.m. this morning at Montefiore hospital in the Bronx. Guerra and his partner Rosa Rodriguez, 36, were the first to arrive on the combusting scene at the 18-story Unity Tower at 2007 Surf Ave in Coney Island where 'firebug' Marcello Dockery used his lighter to set a mattress on fire in the hallway of he and his mother's apartment in public housing. Scroll down for video . Dennis Guerra, 38, died this morning after suffering injuries from a fire in a Coney Island apartment building alighted by a 'bored' 16-year-old arsonist . Evil grin: Marcell Dockery, 16, flashed a smile for the cameras during his arrest for allegedly starting a fire in Coney Island Sunday that left two police officers clinging to life . Bored firebug: Dockery, 16, admitted to police he set a mattress on fire inside the building out of boredom . Rodriguez, a single mother of four, . is alive at the burn unit Weill Cornell Medical Center where she was . placed in a hyperbaric chamber. She is a four year veteran of the NYPD . Housing Bureau. Both officers were hurt on Sunday . when they arrived on the scene of the fire and were engulfed by layers . of smoke and carbon monoxide. 'Can't Breathe,' Guerra said on the radio as officers heard him gasping for air.' 'He can’t breathe. He’s on the 14th floor. They’re on the 14th floor. They can’t breathe.' 'Thirteen!' Guerra said desperate for help, reports CBS. On Monday, police arrested 16-year-old Marcell Dockery on charges of assault, arson and reckless endangerment. Authorities said he lives in the building and set fire to a mattress that had been discarded in a hallway. During his arrest, the suspected arsonist was seen flashing a smile for the awaiting news cameras while being led to a police cruiser. ‘We saw him smiling on TV, is this a joke? We are going through so much right now,’Guerra’s outraged mother, Miriam, told the New York Post. Suspicious fire: Firefighters located officers Dennis Guerra and Rosa Rodriguez unconscious and unresponsive on the floor of the hall of the 13th floor . The two veteran officers were overcome by smoke when they took an elevator up to the 13th floor inside an 18-story apartment complex on Surf Avenue . Dockery later revealed to detectives that boredom led him to light the mattress on fire. He was ordered held without bail. ‘I decided to take a lighter and light the top of the mattress because I was bored,’ he reportedly told police. The teen described how he attempted to put out the flames, and when that failed, how he started knocking on neighbors’ doors to alert them to the danger, NBC New York reported. A source told the tabloid that Dockery is a ‘firebug’ who has been bragging about his obsession with flames on his Facebook page. Dockery has a lengthy history with the NYPD. In 2010, he was arrested for arson. His sealed record also includes criminal mischief and marijuana possession charges. The teen also may have been responsible for other small fires inside the Surf Avenue housing complex. Police Commissioner William Bratton said firefighters who responded to the scene just after noon last Sunday found both officers 'unconscious and unresponsive' in the hallway on the 13th floor. Confession: The teen described how he attempted to put out the flames before he started knocking on neighbors' doors to alert them to the fire . Emergency: Rodriguez, 36, was taken to . Weill Cornell Medical Center, Guerra, 38, was taken to Jacobi . Medical Center in The Bronx, before being transferred to Montefiore Medical Center . The firefighters pulled both officers back into the elevator and brought them downstairs where they were treated by EMS personnel, he said. The mother of four was first stabilized at Lutheran Hospital and then transferred to Weill Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan. On Tuesday, a relative told the New York Daily News that she was doing 'much better' and is expected to recover. Guerra, 38, was taken to Coney Island Hospital and then airlifted to Jacobi Medical Center. Between them the two officers have eight children. Both officers suffered carbon monoxide poisoning and the effects of smoke inhalation. Dockery's mother Sandra Howard is also in trouble after The Housing Authority is moving to terminate her lease, reports The New York Daily News. Howard can either fight to stay at her home or she can sign an exclusion agreement which would forever ban her son from her own home. Wendy Feliciano, the president of the tenants association sympathizes with the mother. 'I feel so bad for the mom,' she said. 'Let’s just hope the little boy gets help. He's 16 and he's looking at a long time in jail.' Dockery's neighbors say that they often saw Docery 'smoking weed in the hallways,' but that he had 'a good mother who goes to church all time' Dockery had been arrested before when he was 13 for allegedly setting a fire in school. He had other sealed arrests for minor charges as a juvenile. He also allegedly threatened a neighbor with a razor and stole $10 out of her purse. Mayor Bill de Blasio held a moment of silence for Guerra at an unrelated event his morning. 'We’ve lost a good man this morning,' de Blasio said. 'We had a very brave police officer Dennis Guerra who did something that most of us wouldn’t understand how to do. He went towards those in danger no matter the risk to him. It’s something that our police officers do every day, it’s something our first responders do every day, it’s something we need to appreciate every day.'","Eight-year NYPD veteran and father of four Dennis Guerra, 38, died at the hospital just before 7 a.m. today .

"When the Viking warrior buried his hoard of silver coins and jewellery in a lead container, he doubtless expected to be back for them after his next battle. But thanks to those pesky Anglo Saxons, they remained undisturbed for more than 1,000 years... until Darren Webster discovered them with a metal detector during his lunch break. Found just 18 inches beneath the surface of a field in Silverdale, Lancashire, the 201 objects were yesterday hailed by the British Museum as one of the most important Viking discoveries of recent times. Artefacts: Darren Webster holds a Viking arm ring which was part of a hoard of the Viking treasure he found in Silverdale . Webster's hoard: A Viking coin depicting the name Alwaldus, which has been attributed to the nephew of Alfred the Great . Based on previous finds, they could be worth as much as £500,000. Mr Webster, a 39-year-old stonemason, said he found the hoard in September. ‘When I lifted the lead pot out of the ground there was a hole underneath and silver started to fall out. That is when I realised I had found something important.’ Quite how important became apparent when one of the 27 coins in the hoard proved to be a previously unrecorded type which the experts believe carries the name of an unknown Viking ruler in northern England. The name is Airdeconut, thought to be an attempt to represent the Scandinavian name Harthacnut. Valuable: Mr Webster holds a Viking arm ring . The coin also helps to dispel the . popularly held view that Vikings were all pagans who pillaged . monasteries out of hatred of the Christian Church. Great: A statue of King Alfred in Winchester . One . side has the words ‘DNS [short for Dominus] REX’, which means ‘the Lord . and King’, and they are arranged in the form of a cross, reflecting the . fact that many Vikings converted to Christianity soon after settling in . Britain. Viking raids on Britain began in 793AD. Then in 865AD a full Viking army stormed through the country. At the time the items were buried around 900AD, the Vikings were . fighting the Anglo Saxons to keep control of the North of England – and . presumably their owner came off second best. The museum’s curator of early medieval . coins, Dr Gareth Williams, estimated the total value of the items at . the time of burial would have been enough to buy ‘a small estate, a . large flock of sheep or a small herd of cattle’. The haul, which has yet to be valued, went on display at the museum yesterday and will be examined by a coroner tomorrow. If an inquest declares that it is treasure, it will be offered to the British Museum or a local museum which has it valued by an independent board of experts. If the museum wants the find, it must pay the market value of the treasure to the finder and/or landowner. If it does not, the finder can keep it. In this case, the Lancaster City Museum is interested in buying the find for its collection. The proceeds are expected to be divided between Mr Webster and the owner of the land.","The 1,100-year-old find includes a coin thought to refer to a previously unknown Viking ruler in northern England .

"More than £1.8m is to be paid back to motorists after they were fined for driving over a city centre bridge. Almost 60,000 motorists were issued with penalty notices for using the Lendal Bridge in York after controversial traffic restrictions were introduced. But the scheme was abandoned after an independent review found the council may have acted unlawfully, and York City Council has confirmed a process for the public to claim the money back is now being worked on. Council leaders in York restricted access to the busy bridge in during an ill-fated traffic experiment . Council officials wrongly designated the bridge a bus lane when the trial was launched in August 2013 . Before the scheme was launched, the bridge, pictured, was heavily congested throughout the day . Cllr David Levene, cabinet member for transport, said the trial 'was never about making money' and that work had to be done to resolve traffic issues in York. He said: 'But whilst the trial achieved some of its aims, it had become too polarizing an issue, requiring too much resource, and so detracting from other necessary transport policies. 'An application will have to be made for refunds to be given as ""a statement of goodwill"" and will not be volunteered as that would legally say the scheme was wrong.' But following the decision, the leader of York City Council, Councillor James Alexander, has faced calls from the Liberal Democrats to stand down. Cllr Keith Aspden, leader of York's Liberal Democrats, said: 'The closure of Lendal Bridge was botched from start to finish and has done deep reputational damage to York. 'As well as repaying the fines, Labour should apologise to the residents, visitors and businesses caught out by the unlawful closure.' He continued: 'They need to explain how the repayment process will work and what effect this decision will have on council budgets. They also need to accept our calls for a full scrutiny review of the trial so that all lessons are learnt. 'What is clear though is that ultimate responsibility for the shambles sits with the Council Leader James Alexander and I, along with many taxpayers, will now expect him to recognise this and resign.' Council officials expect they will have to repay £1.8 million in fines levied during the botched experiment . Meanwhile, conservative Cllr Paul Doughty, said: 'Now finally, not before time, they are forced to repay the fines yet still manage to dig the knife in as the ultimate penalty is paid by the York taxpayer who has to pick up the bill. 'Not only for the hundreds of thousands to repay fines but also the massive cost it will take to administer, the effect on services this may have as well as the city's reputation which they leave in tatters. 'Cllr Alexander even has the gall to say, ""all parties told me they want to move on"". Indeed but he cannot be so naive to believe others will share his administrations blame. In any other industry, heads would roll.' He suggested senior figures at the council should resign. Conservative leader Cllr Chris Steward said 'heads should roll' over the matter and said officers should be answerable. He said the matter was of great reputational and financial cost to York.On the basis of independent legal advice, the City of York Council had been contesting the Traffic Adjudicator's challenge to both the Lendal Bridge and Coppergate schemes. It will now only continue to contest the Coppergate order.Cllr James Alexander said: 'When Liberal Democrats back the cause of Conservatives, that speaks volumes. 'Councillors from all parties have told me that they want to move on, and they are right. It is for this reason, to draw the matter to a close and as a gesture of goodwill, that we make this announcement today. 'The council does not accept the finding of the Traffic Penalty Tribunal as regards the lawful ability to regulate traffic in this way, and is therefore continuing to pursue a review of the Tribunal's decision in relation to the permanent Coppergate order. 'However, the Lendal Bridge trial has now finished, and for this reason, the council does not consider it to be in the public interest to pursue the review in respect of Lendal Bridge. 'The council has taken the decision that in respect of those people who received a fine during the trial traffic regulation of Lendal Bridge, a refund will be made if they make a particular request to the council. This is due to the clear level of public concern during the trial. 'It is hoped that this can be seen as a statement of goodwill and we are drawing a line under the matter.' The bridge was used by many tourists who were unaware of the restrictions and hit with a £30 fine .","York restricted car access to the Lendal Bridge as a trial in August 2013 .

"Confession: Gordon Thompson - branded a 'cynical coward' in court - was jailed for 11 years six months . The devastation he caused created some of the defining images of last summer’s riots. And last night Gordon Thompson – branded a ‘cynical coward’ in court – was told he faces a long jail term after he admitted starting the fire which destroyed a historic furniture store. The 33-year-old had long denied burning down the family-owned House of Reeves shop in the centre of Croydon, south London, during a terrifying night of anarchy. But the Old Bailey heard that moments before the blaze started, Thompson had been shouting ‘Who’s got a lighter?’ and ‘Let’s torch the place’. And as images of the inferno he created were being shown on television later the same evening, a witness said he had boasted: ‘It was me – I did that. I burned Reeves Furniture.’ The fire completely destroyed the 150-year-old store and set fire to buildings opposite, infamously forcing Polish shop assistant Monika Konczyk to jump for her life from her upstairs flat into the arms of rescuers – an image seen around the globe . Just two days into Thompson’s trial, as it became clear his numerous criminal actions on the night had all been caught either on CCTV, in mobile phone video footage or in photographs, he suddenly changed his plea. Heritage destroyed: Fire crews battled desperately to save buildings nearby in London Road . 'Lawless': Thompson joined a masked mob as it targeted the Iceland shop and House of Fraser store before he set light to Reeves . The father of two had been planning . to claim he was bravely trying to stop masked rioters looting the store . when it burst into flames. Yesterday, . however, he pleaded guilty to arson recklessly endangering life and . burglary. He had already admitted burgling two other shops – Iceland and . House of Fraser – on the same evening. Thompson continued denying arson with intent to endanger life and violent disorder, and the jury was directed to find him not guilty on these charges. He will be sentenced in April. The Old Bailey had been told that Thompson, a painter and decorator from Croydon, ‘ran riot’ through the streets on August 8 last year, a night when it seemed anarchy was spreading unchecked across the country. First, he joined a masked mob ‘roaming lawlessly’ through the town as it targeted the Iceland shop and House of Fraser department store – where he was caught on camera clutching stolen bottles of alcohol as he helped others prise open security shutters to gain access. A witness said he helped direct looters inside. He was also seen tipping petrol into the street and trying to ignite it. Thompson then headed to the Reeves store, which was founded in Croydon in 1867 and had survived two world wars. Prosecutor Oliver Glasgow said: ‘Quite what it was that first attracted looters to these premises may remain a mystery since, unlike House of Fraser, which was plundered of clothing and jewellery, few of the rioters could have wanted to steal a sofa. ‘It seems the attention this shop received started when one of the mob threw a piece of debris at one of the glass windows. Lives at risk: One young woman was forced to jump from a burning building near to the blaze at House of Reeves . Devastated: An emotional Maurice Reeves, the furniture store owner, stands outside the charred remains of the shop the day after the riots . Ruins: Such was the intensity of the heat that ravaged the local landmark that firemen had to spend the next day cooling off the smouldering embers . Booty in hand: Thompson was photographed carrying items looted from the Iceland store in Croydon . ‘Thereafter others, including this . defendant, joined in until the window was smashed, torn from its . housing, and the rioters managed to get inside.’ Thompson . was one of the first to enter the shop and emerged carrying a laptop, . causing the crowd to surge forward in search of other valuable goods. ‘That, however, was not an end to the . matter,’ said Mr Glasgow. ‘Having vandalised and looted the store, the . defendant was still not satisfied. In an act of cynical cowardice, he . asked another of the rioters for a lighter and went back to the shop and . set fire to a sofa inside the shattered window. 'The effect, as anyone would realise . and as he plainly intended, was catastrophic. The sofa went up in . flames, as did other pieces of furniture in the showroom, and within . minutes the inferno was raging out of control.’ The prosecutor said Thompson remained at the scene ‘to watch what he had done’ before the heat and flames drove him away. ‘The . ensuing fire razed the building,’ Mr Glasgow said. ‘Such was the . ferocity of the blaze that embers and heat from the flames set fire to . property on the other side of the road and numerous residents were . forced to flee their homes for their lives.’ The . destruction of the House of Reeves was valued at £1million, damage to . House of Fraser at £105,000, and fire damage to nearby tram lines at . £330,000. Thompson was arrested after he was pictured in a newspaper. Reeves . is now trading from another store. Owner Maurice Reeves spoke yesterday . of the misery the fire had caused his  family. ‘It’s been such a . traumatic time for us,’ he said. ‘The . building’s been there all my life, I worked in there every day and when . I go into work now the building’s not there. It’s with tears in my eyes . when I think about it.’ VIDEO: Maurice Reeves looks over the remains of his business .","Gordon Thompson, 33, told he faces long prison sentence .

"His team mates probably love him during the geography round of a pub quiz... but you won't find his long-suffering wife sharing their enthusiasm. Guinness Rishi, 70, from Delhi, is covered in the flags of 305 different countries, 185 country maps, 165 mini flags and 2,985 characters. His wife, Bimla, finally persuaded him to stop after convincing Guinness that no one else would want to break his world record - which officially stands at his 2009 total of 220 flag tattoos. 'I've beaten my own record and will invite the adjudicators to come update their books, so that my new total is recognised through the years,' said Guinness, who changed his name from Har Prakash when he set out to break as many world records as possible five years ago. Guinness Rishi, 70, from Delhi, is covered in the flags of 305 different countries, 185 country maps, 165 mini flags and 2,985 characters . Mr Rishi's commitment to breaking records means . he might find it hard to resist having the most tattoo artists working . on him at the same time . His 22 records include such singular feats as making the longest will in the world - a whopping 489 pages, delivering a pizza from New Delhi to San Francisco, and, of course, carrying the highest number of tattoos on his body. Guinness's wife Bimla is so angered by her husband's attention-seeking that she refuses to go to the market or be seen in public with him. 'I want to be remembered after I die,' said Mr Rishi. 'But my wife is angry at me for getting so many tattoos and that is why she threatens to have nothing to do with me. 'I have not finished yet and am simply looking for a new record I can break.' Guinness Rishi's world records are displayed in a room in his Delhi home. His wife Bimla is too embarrassed to be seen with him - she refuses to let him join her when going to the market . Mr Rishi now plans to break another record - as the world's worst political candidate. With hundreds of flags tattooed on his face and body and a scary mannequin head as his only assistant, Mr Rishi looks a strong contender for world's most unelectable politician. He is contesting local municipal elections in an attempt to create a world record by not receiving a single vote. But Mr Rishi's wife is so angered by her husband's attention-seeking that she has threatened to scupper his plans to win another world record, by voting FOR him. Mr Rishi's other records include 'taking on the world's oldest adoptee', after he legally took custody of his 61-year-old brother-in-law, and building the tallest sugar cube tower in the world, which stood at 64 inches. Incredibly, the committed record-breaker also had all his teeth extracted so he could fill his mouth with 750 straws. 'People call me a joker, a madman. It doesn't bother me,' said Guinness. 'My dream is to go around the world several times. I want the children of those countries to ask me, where is the flag of our country, spot it and then, in the process, become aware of my country and other countries as well. 'In fact, I am donating my body to the Ripley's Believe It Or Not museum, so that they preserve it and put in on display.' Among the 330 different country flags on his body, Guinness Rishi sports the Union Flag on his forehead . To win support for his bid to preserve his body on public display Guinness even has a tattoo on his forehead bearing the legend, Ripley's Believe It Or Not. And it seems his days of getting inked may not be completely over - Guinness simply confirms he has enough flags on his body. His commitment to breaking records means he might find it hard to resist having the most tattoo artists working on him at the same time. 'The record is held by an American who in 1996 had 22 artists work on him,' he says. 'As a matter of fact, I did break the record in Pattaya last year when 25 artists etched 55 flags on me. But I was not familiar with the rules and forgot to make a video recording.' While his forehead, head, arms, legs and chest are covered with tattoos, his back remains pristine clear. 'I am saving that for a dream project,' said Guinness. 'It's going to be the hall of fame for world record holding tattoo artists. I will have all their names and achievements tattooed on my back.'","His wife, Bimla, has threatened to sabotage his next world record attempt - to be the worst political candidate with no support - by voting FOR him ."
"Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney dished about an awkward encounter with a masseuse during the 2012 campaign while appearing on the inaugural installment of Bloomberg Television show With All Due Respect on Monday evening. Asked by co-host Mark Halperin what his 'single weirdest experience' as a presidential candidate was, Romney revealed that after shaking too many hands at an event in San Francisco, California, once, 'I began to get kind of a kink in my back. 'And so I asked ... the guy who traveled with me...I said, ""Can you find someone to get me a back massage at the hotel tonight?"" Not running: Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney reiterated on Monday that he's not planning to pursue the presidency for a third time in 2016 . 'And he got a massage therapist, I think, from the Ritz-Carlton to come over and come in our room,' Romney said. 'And so he sat there to make sure that we had two people there at all times. And she gave me a massage. And she was Hispanic American. 'And after I left to go get changed and showered and so forth, she turned to him and she said, ""Is he a dancer?"" ' Romney told Halperin and With All Due Respect's other co-host John Heilemann, 'That was the best compliment I have ever had.' The former Massachusetts governor went on to explain that the woman thought he was a dancer because, as she said, ' ""He has strong legs."" ' 'They're bird legs, actually, but she thought they were strong,' he said, laughing. The interview with Romney was nearly as awkward as his experience with the masseuse, with Halperin asking for his thoughts on Downtown Abbey in the post-Matthew Crawley age and potential image problems for the Crawley family's dog, whose name is, coincidentally, Isis. At the end of the show the Halperin and Heilemann showed Romney a family portrait and asked him to name all 21 of his grandchildren. After realizing half way through that Romney, 67, does in fact know and recognize the offspring of his five sons, Haperin begged him to stop. Romney also dished on his 'single weirdest experience' on the campaign trail, explaining it involved a masseuse who thought he was a dancer because he has 'strong legs' The interview wasn't all fluff, with the trio taking a few minutes to discuss President Barack Obama's decision not to leave a limited number of troops behind in Iraq after the U.S. handed control of the country back to the Iraqi people - Romney thinks he should have - and whether foreign policy will be a voting issue in November - Romney says it will. Halperin and Heilemann didn't let Romney leave the set without commenting on his much talked about 2016 comeback campaign, which the retired Republican politician assured them it is not in the cards. Commenting on his wife's suggestion last month that her husband's potential candidacy would hinge on former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's plans, Romney called Bush 'an excellent person' and said he 'could be a terrific president.' 'I think that about a lot of the people who are running on the Republican side,' he added. 'My guess is you're gonna see 15 or so people on the stage at the first debate. 'Among those people we're gonna find someone who catches fire, who ignites the interests of the Republican base, and you're gonna see someone who can go on to become president.' Heilemann noted that Romney has left the 'door open' for another run during an interview in late August when he claimed that 'circumstances change.' 'And then I went on to say, I'm not letting my head go there, where I'm focused on making sure we nominate the right person, who cares about the kinds of issues I care about,' Romney replied, trying yet again to tamp down expectations for his political career. Romney said he would be looking to endorse someone in 2016 who cares about foreign policy, economy and the 'looming issue of poverty,' which he said in an important issue 'that's not being addressed.","Romney dished about the awkward encounter while appearing on the first installment of Bloomberg Television show With All Due Respect .

"There was no rimshot in the Iowa crowd, but former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney told a devastating joke at President Barack Obama's expense on Sunday during a campaign stump speech for Iowa Senate hopeful Joni Ernst. The partisan audience stepped on his punchline, but the former Massachusetts governor didn't seem to mind. 'Obama went to the bank to cash a check,' Romney began. 'He didn't have his ID. And the teller said, ""You've got to prove who you are."" And he said, ""How should I do that?"" SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

So he set up a little cup on the ground, took a golf ball, putted it right into that cup, so we knew it was Phil Mickelson. We cashed the check"".' ""'And then Andre Agassi came in,""' Romney continued, in the voice of the fictional bank teller, '""and Andre Agassi didn't have his ID either. He put up a little target on the wall, took a tennis ball and a racket, hit it onto that target time and again. We knew it was Andre Agassi, so we cashed his check"".'

"With their golden age behind them Spain get ready to go again on Thursday night in Paris against Didier Deschamps’ French team. With Xabi Alonso and Xavi Hernandez recently retired and the horror-show memories of losing to Holland and Chile in Brazil still fresh in the mind can they rebuild in time to be a force at France 2016? We answer some key questions. What is the mood like in their first game since the World Cup failure? Melancholic. Wednesday morning’s papers were full of the team photos of the last Spain side that played in the Stade de France. David Villa, Xabi Alonso, Xavi, Gerard Pique, Alvaro Arbeloa, Victor Valdes and Nacho Monreal all started in that crucial World Cup qualifier that Spain won 1-0 last year but will not be on the pitch when the game kicks off on Wednesday. Villa, Xabi and Xavi have all retired and will be impossible to replace. Pique’s self-confessed dip in form and fitness will also create a huge problem if it continues because there are no central defenders on the horizon. VIDEO Scroll down to watch a new look Spain team train ahead of France friendly . Retired: Spanish trio Xabi Alonso, David Villa and Xavi have all decided to hang up their boots . Jumping for joy: Chelsea striker Diego Costa is expected to lead the line for Spain . Sounds grim, maybe Vicente del Bosque and Roy Hodgson need to swap squads for a couple of games so Spanish fans can get things back into perspective? Well exactly. Group stage elimination was hard to take after winning three tournaments on the bounce and some all-time greats have since quit, but still if you look at Spain’s proposed starting line-up you would probably say that eight of the 11 would walk into the England team. Hart, Cahill and Sterling might keep out Casillas, Albiol and Pedro. But Alba, Ramos, Azpilicueta, Koke, Busquets, Fabregas, Silva and Costa would all make Roy’s cut. So it’s not all doom and gloom; what’s the grand plan? Del Bosque has the same dilemma he had before the World Cup. He does not want to betray the short-passing game that gave the team its unprecedented success but some of the team’s most important players actually play a slightly more direct game. And he needs to recognise that. Selection dilemma: Vicente del Bosque must decide who will fill the boots of Alonso and Xavi . Warm up: Spain's stars were put through their paces in a pre-match training session . Players such as? Centre-forward Diego Costa, his Chelsea team-mate Cesc Fabregas, and his former Atletico Madrid team-mates Koke and Raul Garcia all favour a slightly more direct approach. But Spain are not going to start playing like Chelsea or Atletico Madrid? There is still a big Barcelona influence with Pique, Alba, Iniesta and Busquets integral, but Del Bosque can’t watch videos of Fabregas setting-up Costa to score every weekend in the Premier League and not want to incorporate that into his new Spain side. A big Barça presence still then, but also a big Premier League one? Very much so and if Casillas’ World Cup form were to continue and he were to lose his Real Madrid place then Spain would look to a new number one – probably Manchester United’s David de Gea. Adding a Premier League keeper to the names of Azpilicueta, Fabregas, Silva and Costa would mean almost half the team would be based in England. Competition: Man United goalkeeper David de Gea will be hoping to dislodge Real Madrid's Iker Casillas . Down to the nuts and bolts then: what formation will Del Bosque play? Who are the undroppables? And where are the doubts? It seems 4-3-3 will be system with Costa at centre-forward, Ramos at centre-back and Busquets in centre-midfield, the three players its hardest to see being left out. Silva and Pedro are expected to play either side of the Chelsea centre-forward and Koke and Fabregas either side of Busquets. Andres Iniesta and Thiago Alcantara will both need to come back into the equation when fit again. Defensively Del Bosque is desperately looking for alternatives to Pique and could try both Barcelona’s Marc Bartra and Athletic Bilbao’s Miquel San Jose on Wednesday. Azpilicueta and Alba will be pushed by Real Madrid’s Dani Carvajal and Atletico Madrid’s Juanfran at full-back. And that just leaves Casillas trying to get back to his best but under pressure from De Gea. Will it be enough to see them reign again? It will be enough to see them challenge again. Matching the team that had Villa, Carles Puyol, Xabi and Xavi as its spine will be much more difficult.","Spain take on Les Bleus in a friendly at the Stade de France .

"Parents of a teenage boy who committed suicide are fighting Facebook over privacy laws which block grieving families from accessing minors' accounts. Eric Rash, 15, took his own life in January 2011. His body was found by his father Ricky in a field close to the family's farm in Nottaway County, Virginia. Following his shocking death, the grieving parents wanted to check Eric's Facebook profile in the hope of shedding some light on why the teenager took his own life. However Facebook does not allow parents to access their children's account because of federal and state privacy laws - a matter which is being debated today in the Virginia Senate. Scroll down for video . Searching for answers: Eric Rash, 15, took his own life in a field next to his family's Virginia farm in January 2011. His parents battled Facebook to access his account to look for clues . Distraught: Ricky and Diane Rash fought Facebook to gain access to their son's account following his suicide and are now supporting a change in privacy laws in Virginia . Eric's death left his family reeling . as to why the teenager, who was a straight-A student with dreams of . going to Virginia Tech and Harvard Law School, would take his own life. Their son left letters for his parents and sisters telling them he was 'sorry' but gave little clue as to why he would want to kill himself. His mother Diane told WTVR: 'He just said if life after high school was worse than high school, then he didn’t want to be in it.' Ricky and Diane Rash hoped that there may be clues on his Facebook account but when they . went to log-on, they were not allowed access to his password. Their son had changed his details in the days before his death. Questions: Mrs Rash has hoped that accessing her son's Facebook account might shed some light on his tragic suicide . The social . network finally allowed the couple limited access to information from Eric's account in April . 2012, more than a year after his death. His parents are now . fighting for a change in legislation which will help other families whose children tragically take their own lives. Mr Rash told the Washington Post: 'We were just grieving parents reaching out for anything we could. Our issue with Facebook and social media is, we should . have access.' The . Virginia Senate was expected to vote today on a bill which will allow parents and legal . guardians in the state to access Internet accounts of deceased . children. Tragedy: The teenage boy took his own life in January 2011 close to his family's Virginia farm . At the moment, Facebook will deactivate pages or turn profiles into a memorial wall when loved ones provide proof of death. Facebook has grown to more than a billion members since its launch in 2004. Oklahoma, Idaho, Rhode Island, Indiana and . Connecticut have passed legislation which allows parents greater access to a minor's online accounts. Since 2009, it has been Facebook policy to memorialize the account of a person who has died. If a close family member reports to the company that a loved one has died - and provides proof in the form of a death certificate or published obituary - Facebook switches the account to a memorial page. An immediate relative may also request to have the page taken down entirely. It is estimated that there are 30million Facebook profiles for people who have died. A Facebook spokesman told MailOnline: 'These are tragic situations and Facebook always tries to be as helpful to families as possible while still complying with federal and state law. 'The Uniform Law Commission is currently drafting model legislation to guide states in addressing these complicated situations.  We appreciate and support the ULC's efforts.' Facebook allows friends and family to post remembrances about loved ones who have died but also protect the privacy of the deceased. They also honor requests from immediate family . members to deactivate the account, which removes the profile and related information from Facebook. The social network says that in individual cases when the family wants to have access to a dead relative's Facebook account, then they will allow it, if they are covered by law. It is not the first time that Facebook has run into a legal issue with grieving parents. When University of Wisconsin student Benjamin Stassen, 21, committed suicide in 2011, his parents Helen and Jay Stassen were in a similar situation as they tried to gain information from his Facebook account. The Stassens got a court order to demand access to . Benjamin's account but the social media firm denied it. The Stassens were able to successfully gain access to their son's Gmail account after they obtained a court order to force Google to turn the account over. 'Many people don’t have that knowledge, don’t have that experience and unless they have the financial means to hire an attorney to do this for them, they are very likely to feel stuck and not know what to do,' Mr Stassen said last year.","Eric Rash, 15, took his own life in January 2011 in a field next to his family's Virginia farm .

"Horror: Six-year-old Erfan Ali after he was savaged by an out of control dog . The owner of a Rhodesian Ridgeback called Tyson is facing jail after the dog savaged a six-year-old schoolboy. Erfan Ali was scarred for life when the neighbour's pet jumped a four foot high wooden fence into his family's garden. The Cardiff schoolboy was helping his mother, Monowara Ali, and sister Masudah, 12, bring the washing in when the dog landed and pounced on him. Mrs Ali, 37, fled into the house with her son but was unable to stop the dog forcing its way into the kitchen and continuing the attack. The six-year-old suffered deep cuts to both sides of his face and the attack continued until dog owner Kevin Large, 27, managed to drag the animal away. Large, 27, from Gabalfa, Cardiff admitted failing to control the animal at Cardiff Crown Court and will be sentenced next month. Erfan's dad, Dilwar, 38, said: 'The dog was really attacking my boy badly - it bit his right and left cheeks and his left hand has been damaged as well. 'There was blood everywhere.' After the incident in September last . year Erfan was taken to University Hospital, Cardiff and then . transferred to a special unit in Swansea. Mr Dilwar, a restaurant owner, said: 'The plastic surgeons took the decisions to operate as soon as possible. Recovery: The six-years-old has needed plastic surgery to try and fix the scarring to his face. 'My son will be scarred on his face and will need future operations. 'The . scars are not just physical - Erfan cries at night, he doesn’t want to . sleep alone and he feels safer in school because there are big gates and . other children around him. 'He is extremely scared of dogs and doesn’t trust any animals. I don’t want this to happen to other children.' Since the attack the Ali family have moved to a new part of the city in a bid to put the incident behind them.  Speaking at the time of the attack Large said: 'I am just feeling really bad, I am just devastated over the situation. 'I climbed over the fence because I could hear screaming and I could see the dog in next door’s hallway. 'He was barking so I just quickly grabbed him. I didn’t know what had happened. I saw the little boy and the blood on his face. ADMISSION: Kevin Large at Cardiff Crown Court . Dog: Rhodesian Ridgebacks are also known as African Lion Hounds . 'You can imagine what I thought then - it was just panic.' Tyson has been put down since the attack. The dog was a Rhodesian Ridgeback, a South African breed of dog known for its . bravery. They are also known as African Lion Hounds as they have been . used to hunt lions, but are not banned in the UK. Large who insisted Tyson had been 'a lovely dog' admitted the charge under the dangerous dogs act. The . hearing was told Erfan’s parents will address to . court during sentencing to describe the impact of the attack. Judge Huw Davies released Large on bail but warned he could face custody.

"Jose Mourinho believes Fernando Torres needed a 'change of scenery' from Chelsea, but the Portuguese would have preferred if the Spain striker had moved to Inter Milan rather than AC Milan. Torres agreed a two-year loan move to Milan - and not Mourinho's former team Inter - after a challenging three-and-a-half-years at Stamford Bridge following his £50million arrival from Liverpool in January 2011. 'I'm an Interista and I would have preferred if he'd gone to Inter,' Chelsea boss Mourinho told reporters at a UEFA coaching seminar in Nyon.

"A small town in Texas was hit with a whopper of a storm Wednesday morning that left four feet of hail in its wake. Officials from the National Weather Service in Amarillo said that the storm was so severe and the hail so unrelenting that a major highway in Potter County was completely covered. But the photos of the one-off event are so unbelievable that an army of online sceptics have cast doubt on their authenticity, suggesting that instead they may simply show large rocks. Scroll down for video . Seeing is believing: A freak storm hit Amarillo, Texas, and left behind four feet of hail, as can be seen in this picture posted by local authorities . Phenomenon: The enormous amounts of hail have led to flash flood from meltwater . Relief: The photos are so unreal, Facebook commenters didn't believe the National Weather Service . Several vehicles got stuck in the flash flooding and two feet of water also struck a stretch of Highway 136, the weather service reported. One Chevy Tahoe, a large SUV, got stuck in hail up to its hood, Krissy Scotten, a spokeswoman for the weather service office in Amarillo, told MSNBC.com. When the weather service posted a photograph to Facebook of a firefighter next to the ice — which reached all the way up to his chest — commenters couldn't believe their eyes. 'That just doesn't even look real! Dang!' Bridget Hefner said on the site. Commenters turned their disbelief into hypotheses, offering alternative explanations to the unbelievable reality. 'Looks like a bunch of rocks/stones,' suggested Tiffany Baugh Berry. Another cynical poster wrote: 'It's a lite dusting of hail on some damn rocks.' Perfect Storm: The snow stranded motorists in muddy, hail drifts and closed a highway for several hours . 'I can assure you we do not have big rocks like that in West Texas,' Scotten retorted to MSNBC.com. 'That was four feet of ice,' she insisted, adding that the hail was compacted by rain and floodwater across a wide area. The storm which dumped several feet of hail on a Texas town was apparently a supercell, also known as a 'rotating thunderstorm'. While the hailstones produced by the storm were not extremely large, the slow-moving storm allowed the hail to accumulate in one place. Meteorologist Jim LaDue wrote on his blog that the hail was the result of 'the slow storm motion and its relatively efficient precipitation production'. He continued: 'The storm motion was so slow because the low-level easterly upslope nearly opposed the midlevel westerly flow.' This unusual weather front creates a storm which moves particularly slowly, meaning that the area directly beneath it is heavily affected even if it is not otherwise particularly severe. Of course, to create that much hail required a large amount of water in the atmosphere - and according to Mr LaDue, the air was indeed much more moist than would be expected for the season. She blamed the ice's rock-like appearance on drought. 'We're very dusty around here,' she said. 'It was actually the rain/water that . caused the drifts,' Scotten said. 'Anytime you have hail accumulate two . to four feet high and get over three inches of rain, no matter how it . occurs, it's pretty incredible.' The Texas Department of Transportation said that at the storm's climax, there was zero visibility on the road. Maintenance crews worked on Thursday . to clear roads after the storm, which left so much hail in its wake that . workers had to use snow plows to clear the piles from the road. 'It was crazy,' National Weather Service Meteorologist Justyn Jackson said about the freak event. As the hail started to melt, it created flash floods which swept through the area. 'It looked like soap suds,' said a local TV meteorologist. 'The storm was moving really slow and a combination of the pea-sized . hail and four to six inches of rain created those conditions.' The rural area where the storm struck . was mainly ranch land, about 25 miles north of Amarillo and south of . Dumas. Rainwater gushed across the parched land, washing dirt and then . mud into the hail, pushing it all onto U.S. 287, Potter County Sheriff . Brian Thomas said. 'There were just piles of hail,' said . Maribel Martinez with the Amarillo/Potter/Randall Office of Emergency . Management. 'Some of the cars were just buried in hail and people were . trapped in their cars.' The southbound lane of the highway, which was shut down around 5pm on Wednesday, finally reopened early on Thursday morning,. Emergency crews also got several . swift-water rescue calls as the road was flooded in low-lying areas, she . said. Rural fences and vehicles suffered hail damage but there were no . reported injuries. Braun said work crews stayed in . roadside ditches on Thursday afternoon diligently trying to break up the . ice jams and debris that had fused together and prevented drainage. 'We've got five, six-foot high icebergs along the roadway,' Braun said. 'If we get another rainstorm it will flood again.' Not the first time: A storm this huge hit Texas in 1993 and left behind nearly six feet of hail . But the National Weather Service said it's starting to clear up and should be a sunny weekend. 'That's a good thing since it will take a few days for that hail to melt,' said Andrew Moulton, an NWS meteorologist in Amarillo. Pea-sized hail, flash flooding and rain combined to form the perfect storm, but it didn't set any records. Scotten says the weather service doesn't keep records of quantities of hail. Freak of nature: The massive drift of hail appeared brown as it was covered in dust from the prolonged drought recently experienced in the area . 'This was just one of those weird storms,' Potter County sheriff Brian Thomas told KAMR-TV. The region isn't unfamiliar with this kind of weather either. A similar storm hit Dalhart, Texas, in 1993, according to Jose Garcia, the chief forecaster at Amarillo's weather service. He said that the five to six-foot deep hail took over a month to melt.

"The woman who was jailed for planting a severed human finger in a bowl of chili in an attempt to extort money from Wendy's has been accused of lying again. Authorities alleged that infamous 'chili finger lady', Anna Ayala, 47, invented detailed reports of two men who 'shot' her 26-year-old son outside their home in San Jose, California. Officers believe that Guadalupe 'Junior' Reyes, who has a previous burglary conviction and is not allowed to own a gun, shot himself, and his mother backed up the false story. After the pair got their tales mixed up, police arrested them both on Thursday. The infamous 'chili finger lady' Anna Ayala (left) is now accused of making up a story to protect her son Junior Reyes (right) who was found with a gunshot wound despite not being allowed to own a gun . They face up to four years in prison if convicted. Ayala is accused of being an . accessory to a felony and filing a false police report, while Reyes . faces charges related to being felon in possession of a firearm and . ammunition. The mother, who has a long history of filing lawsuits, was released from prison after serving four years for the gruesome Wendy's chili finger case in 2005. The bizarre scam gathered . worldwide attention after Ayala dropped the 1 1/2 inch section of ring . finger in her bowl of fast-food chili. Bizarre hoax: Anna Ayala and her husband, Jaime Plascencia, were jailed in 2005 after cooking up a scheme to plant a severed finger in a bowl of Wendy's chili to extort money from the fast food chain . It was revealed Ayala's husband, Jaime Plascencia, had bought the digit for $100 from a co-worker who lost it in an accident. He then took it home where Ayala cooked it before depositing it in her meal on March 24, 2005. Wendy's claimed they lost $21 million in business because of the bogus allegations. Now police accuse Ayala of dreaming up another tall tale to protect her son. When officers found Junior Reyes suffering from a gunshot wound to . his ankle outside the family home he told them that he had . been attacked by a pair of men for 'for no rhyme or reason.' According to the Mercury News, Ayala is charged with using her vivid imagination to back up his claims and she now faces more time in prison. The mom said one of the attackers . wore a black Oakland A's cap and Air Jordan sneakers, while his . accomplice was a big man with a goatee and abnormally large ears who . rode a black bicycle. Ayala even gave a name for the . supposed attacker. But when authorities found a match for the supposed . suspect, they quickly ruled the man out of the accusations. 'I don't know if it was someone she . knew who she described or how she came up with the description,' said . Santa Clara County prosecutor Bret Wasley. When officers went back to question . mother and son, Wasley said that 'She backed off from her statements' while 'Junior changed his story into something unbelievable about him . chasing after a dog.' On her Facebook page 'about' section Ayala describes herself as 'Crazzzzzyyyyy and a very good chili cook... (finger lady )' San Jose police Detective Nathaniel Braxton then confronted Reyes with the theory that the pair had made up the whole story as he wasn't supposed to even own a gun. 'I told Reyes that shooting yourself in the foot is not a crime, it's an accident, but making a false report is a crime,' reports the Mercury News. 'Yea,' said Reyes, according to the report. 'I shot myself.' But when Braxton asked his mother about the new information she told him: 'I don't know nothing.' Braxton said that he 'reminded Ayala that she went to prison for doing the same thing before' and asked her where the gun was. She replied 'There's no gun no more, . it's done, thrown away' before telling police she had returned the . firearm to an unidentified friend. 'Ayala's statement confirms Reyes shot himself and she admitted to getting rid of the evidence,' reads the report. Both are being held on $21,000 bail each and are scheduled to appear in court on Friday. Ayala now faces a maximum of another four years in jail while Reyes could be convicted to up to four years and eight months. According to the detective's report, 'Ayala's final statement was, 'I'm not going back to prison for something that has nothing to do with me.""' Ayala appeared contrite after her release from prison, telling CBS that she had faced ridicule in jail for her part in the scam and that 'I learned my lesson and I just want to move on with my life.' On Facebook, Ayala's 'favorite quote' is: . What happend (all sic) in 2005 was the biges badest ? That happend in . my life ....Im sorry for all the dameges i was in ..........i did the . time and its in the past...' The 'chili finger lady' was convicted in 2005 and released for good behavior in 2009 . Also on Facebook, Ayala's 'about' section reads: 'Crazzzzzyyyyy and a very good chili cook ... (finger lady ) ...' In 2005, the Associated Press revealed that even before the chili finger episode, Ayala had been involved in at least half a dozen legal battles in the San Francisco Bay area. She brought a suit against an ex-boss in 1998 for sexual harassment and sued an auto dealership in 2000, alleging the wheel fell off her car. That suit was dismissed after Ayala fired her lawyer, who said she had threatened him. The case against her former employer was settled in arbitration in June 2002, but it was not known whether she received any money. Ayala acknowledged, however, that her family received a settlement for their medical expenses about a year ago after reporting that her daughter, Genesis, got sick from food at an El Pollo Loco restaurant in Las Vegas. She declined to provide any further details.","Anna Ayala, 47, accused of making up evidence to protect son who 'shot himself in foot' despite being banned from owning a gun .

According to blog Krebs on Security, . which first reported the embarrassing security breach, the stolen data . can be used to create duplicate cards. The U.S. Secret Service is now investigating a major cyber intrusion at an Atlanta-based payment processor that could expose millions of MasterCard, Visa, American Express and Discover cardholders to fraudulent charges. Processor Global Payments Inc said on Friday it had found 'unauthorized access' into its system early in March and notified law enforcement and financial institutions. Payment network operators MasterCard Inc, Visa Inc , American Express Co and Discover Financial Services confirmed they were affected, along with banks and other franchises that issue cards bearing their logos. 'If you've paid a NYC cab in the last few months with your credit or . debit card, be sure to check your card statements for possible fraud.' -Avivah Litan . A spokesman for the Secret Service said the agency is leading investigations into the case but declined to give any details. The companies notified . U.S. banks of a potential security breach, and they are now going . through the process of pinpointing the affected accounts before . contacting customers involved. Customers are urged to check their accounts online or contact their financial institution regarding any concerns they have. Visa have already provided the issuing . banks with the affected account numbers and assured customers they would . not be responsible for fraudulent purchases. The companies, which are the two largest . global credit card processors, said the issue stemmed from a third-party . vendor, reportedly Global Payments, and not their own internal systems. Atlanta-based company Global Payments are being named as the third party processor where the breach occurred. Following the news, shares of the company were halted after dropping more than 9.1 per cent. Global Payments said it had 'identified and self-reported unauthorized access into a portion of its processing system' and had determined in early March that the intruders might have gained access to credit-card data. Theft: MasterCard confirmed they are currently investigating a potential account data compromise event of a U.S.-based entity . Though millions of U.S. cardholders could be affected, it does not necessarily mean their cards were used fraudulently but that the cardholder's information was accessed. Mastercard said in a statement: . 'MasterCard is concerned whenever there is any possibility that cardholders could be inconvenienced and we continue to both monitor this event and take steps to safeguard account information. 'If cardholders have any concerns about their individual accounts, they should contact their issuing financial institution.' Visa also released a statement saying their customers were victims of data theft, but said its own systems were not hacked. 'Visa Inc is aware of a potential data compromise incident at a third party entity affecting card account information from all major card brands. 'Visa has provided payment card issuers with the affected account numbers so they can take steps to protect consumers through independent fraud monitoring and, if needed, reissuing cards.' Brian Krebs, left, reported that Mastercard and Visa were contacting their customers about the breach and Avivah . Litan, right, security analyst at Gartner Research, said there are signs the data is already being used by thieves . Once a person swipes their credit card to pay, the transaction then is sent through . a chain of processing. First they are aggregated and sent to a server before the card information reaches a processor for authorization. The processor then sends the authorization request to the bank who check the details (if it is a legitimate account and if there is enough money to cover charge) and then confirm the authorization back to the processor. The current breach is believed to have occurred at the central . aggregation point where card information is calculated. The companies' statements came after the blog Krebs on Security reported . that MasterCard and Visa Inc have been alerting banks across the U.S. about a 'massive' breach that may affect more than ten million . cardholders. He told Technology Live: 'Law enforcement asked everyone to keep . it quiet so as not to disturb investigations.

"An Argentinian divorcee who got a personal phone call from the Pope to calm her worries about whether she could take communion as a divorced woman has been pictured for the first time. Jaqueline Sabetta, who married her new husband in 1994, asked the pontiff for advice about taking the Eucharist, which is traditionally forbidden for divorcees. In a significant break from Catholic doctrine, Pope Francis told her that she would be ‘doing no harm’.

Message of love: By telling Mrs Sabetta that she would 'do no harm' by taking communion as a former divorcee, Pope Francis goes against Catholic tradition . Mrs Sabetta, who is from Santa Fe in the Pope’s home country of Argentina, wrote to him last year asking what to do, ‘given that to take communion would be violating one of the rules of the church’. Seven months later she was amazed to receive a phone call at home from someone who ‘presented himself as father Bergoglio’, the Pope’s name before he was elected to lead the church. After apologising for the lateness of his response, Pope Francis reportedly said: ‘It is a question that we are discussing at the Vatican, because a divorced person who takes communion is not doing any harm.’ Last month he told a morning mass in Rome that divorcees should not be condemned, but rather, ‘accompanied’. The extraordinary phone call was revealed by Mrs Sabetta’s new husband Julio, who posted about it on Facebook on Easter Monday.

"Presumed Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush came out swinging at probable Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton on Wednesday over her recent claim that businesses don't create jobs. The 2016 preview of what a match-up between the two politicians would look like came at a rally for Colorado Rep. Cory Gardner, the GOP's nominee to the Senate in that state, yesterday evening. Bush characterized Clinton's blunder as 'breathtaking' and argued that 'the problem in America today is that not enough jobs are being created, [but] they are created by business.' Clinton has since clarified that she meant to say America's economy doesn't grow when businesses outsource jobs. However, likely Republican presidential contenders have seized the opportunity to embarrass Clinton over the verbal misstep and frame her as an extremist. As the midterm elections come to a close and the official start of the 2016 elections draws near, likely Republican contenders have also stepped up their criticisms of each other. Scroll down for video . Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush blasted yesterday Hillary Clinton over her claim recent claim that businesses don't create jobs. Bush, a likely 2016 presidential candidate, made the attack on Clinton at a rally for Republican candidates, in Castle Rock, Colorado . Candidates are expected to begin declaring the formation of presidential exploratory committees as soon as December, though many politicians mulling a run have said they'll make a public announcement early next year. For Democrats, Clinton is the top choice to lead her party, making her an early punching bag for her ideological opponents. Republicans have offered no such mandate. Bush, a former Florida governor, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz are among as many as a dozen politicians expected to compete for the GOP nomination. The presidential hopefuls have been testing out their message on the road this fall as they campaign for the party's Senate candidates in a handful of states that will determine whether Republicans take control of the legislative branch. On Tuesday, Paul also took aim at Clinton's remark, comparing it to President Barack Obama's infamous 'you didn't build that' statement while he stumped for embattled Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts. 'The president says, you didn’t build that, it just sort of happened,' Paul said during a rally at an airport hangar in Wichita, Kansas, according to Buzzfeed. 'The plane just sort of came into being because it was a public road and a public library. 'Hillary Clinton comes up and she says, ""Businesses don’t create jobs."" Anybody here think businesses don’t create jobs?' Paul asked. 'I’m here today to endorse Pat Roberts and [Kansas Gov.] Sam Brownback, because you know what? They know that businesses do create jobs, and I hope you know that too.' Paul continued to riff off Hillary's gaffe in remarks at another event for Roberts later that day, Buzzfeed noted. President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton 'are on another page, they’re on another planet, reading another book,' he reportedly said at one point. Clinton spent Wednesday campaigning for Iowa Rep. Bruce Braley, the Democratic Party's nominee to the Senate in the midwestern state. Since making her gaffe about businesses last week, Clinton has clarified her remarks to reflect her opinion that America's economy doesn't grow when businesses outsource jobs . Clinton holds up an Iowa-themed outfit for her granddaughter, Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky, that Braley presented to her during a Cedar Rapids, Iowa, event yesterday. Clinton has been racking up flight time in the last several weeks as she's traveled the country vouching for her party's midterm election candidates . What Clinton actually said last week during a Massachusetts rally for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Martha Coakley is, 'Don’t let anybody tell you that it’s corporations and businesses that create jobs.' 'You know that old theory, trickle-down economics. That has been tried, that has failed. It has failed rather spectacularly.' Clinton said on Monday that she 'shorthanded' her analysis and denied accusations that she was running the left in order mollify progressives in her party. 'Let me be absolutely clear about what I've been saying for a couple of decades: Our economy grows when businesses and entrepreneurs create good-paying jobs here in an America where workers and families are empowered to build from the bottom up and the middle out -- not when we hand out tax breaks for corporations that outsource jobs or stash their profits overseas,' she told supporters of New York Rep. Sean Maloney at an event she was headlining for him. The former secretary of state's original comment has been further broken down by Republicans to: Hillary Clinton believes 'businesses don't create jobs.' If Clinton does make a play for the White House next year, the gaffe will most definitely come back to haunt her in Republican attack ads. Already, the GOP has tried to paint her as out of touch with reality after the multimillionaire stated that she and husband Bill were 'dead broke' when they left the White House at the end of his presidency. Despite her verbal flubs, Clinton is still considered the candidate to beat in the 2016 bloodbath. In a subtle attempt to position himself as a viable alternative to Clinton on Thursday, freshman Sen. Ted Cruz said the GOP would be handing Clinton a victory if it sent another moderate politician to the general election. 'The only way for Republicans to win, I believe, is to run a candidate who runs as a strong conservative with a positive, optimistic, hopeful message,' he said on CNBC’s Squawk Box. Asked for his thoughts on potential competitor Bush, Cruz, said, 'Jeb has not declared his candidacy. I like Jeb. I’m a fan of Jeb Bush’s. I’m going to let him decide if he’s running first and let the primary voters make a decision. 'But I will say this: We need to learn from history, we need to look to history and what works and what doesn’t,' Cruz stated, per Politico. 'If we run another candidate in the mold of a Bob Dole or a John McCain or Mitt Romney, we will end up with the same result which is millions of people will stay home on Election Day... and if we run another candidate like that, Hillary Clinton will be the next president,' he claimed. Kentucky Sen. Paul Rand has also knocked Clinton for her verbal misstep this week. At a rally at Jabara Airport in Wichita, Kansas, in support of Republican Gov. Sam Brownback , left, and Sen. Pat Roberts, right, on Tuesday, Paul compared Clinton's flub to Obama's infamous 'you didn't build that' line . Cruz went on to explain that Republicans win when they 'draw a clear distinction' between themselves and their Democratic opponents. 'We lose, and this is true over and over again, when we move to the mushy middle and we muddle the differences,' he said. As Cruz pointed out, Bush has not definitively said he is running for president - yet. His son, George P. Bush, stoked speculation that he will ultimately take the dive when he said last Sunday on ABC's This Week that 'it's more than likely that he's giving this serious thought in moving forward ... that he'll run.' Jeb Bush walked back his son's claims on Thursday, saying he was putting the cart before the horse. 'He’s got an opinion. He didn’t talk to me,' Bush told MSNBC's Kasie Hunt. 'When you have kids, you’ll probably have the same frustration,' he said. 'You love them to death and they have their own opinions. But I’ll make up my mind, just as I’ve said, at the end of the year. 'There’s nothing new here,' he promised. Bush would come into the race as the early Republican frontrunner if he did run - setting up a potential general election battle between the two American political dynasties - polls show. The son for former President George H.W. Bush and brother of former president George W. Bush usually takes top billing in 2016 surveys of Republican voters, followed by Paul and Christie. A recent ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed Fox News host and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee pulling out in front of other potential Republican challengers.","Bush argued that 'the problem in America today is that not enough jobs are being created, [but] they are created by business'

"The devastated family of the 62-year-old man who was snatched by a crocodile from a boat in Kakadu National Park were forced to drive for one hour off track before they could get help, Daily Mail Australia can reveal. The three family members, from Darwin, had no phone reception as they witnessed the man get dragged into the water by a 4.7m long saltwater crocodile on Saturday, just after lunchtime, during a fishing trip. They were on the boat with him at the Flying Fox waterhole, when he was grabbed by the beast as he leaned over the boat to wash or empty a bucket, the Northern Territory News reports. The family, thought to be the man's wife, son and daughter-in-law, jumped into a 4x4 car and frantically drove the long drive to the nearest small town, Cooinda, to raise the alarm. The man's remains were found inside one of two crocodiles, shot dead by officers in South Alligator River, in the Arnhem Land region of the Northern Territory, on Sunday. Scroll down for video . A specialist search and rescue team searched for the 62-year-old man all through Saturday and Sunday at the Kakadu National Park . The grandfather-of-four's remains were found inside a 4.7 metre long saltwater crocodile which was shot by NT police . A Northern Territory Police spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia that the family are 'too distraught' to give their statements about the attack at the moment. More family members of the man have flown in from across Australia to comfort them. The man's family, who have not been identified, had previously camped in Kakadu. 'I can only assume they (the family) are devastated,' a police spokesman said. 'The water is deep in this billabong...There is always the potential for a crocodile attack.' The man was on board a boat outside crocodile-management zones patrolled by rangers when the unusual attack happened, sources say. It is thought the family launched their boat in waters about 90 minutes by road from the Cooinda tourist centre. Rangers reopened nearby waters for tourists on Saturday after successive patrols found no crocodiles. Tourists are warned to beware of crocodiles in any part of Kakadu. Police are searching the remote area in Kakadu National Park after the man's family witnessed the attack by the croc . Phil Weeidemier, who runs Barra Tours - a company that organises fishing trips to the South Alligator River, told Daily Mail Australia: 'I've seen plenty of large crocs. You do play Russian roulette with your life up there. 'I've seen big fellas sitting at the back of their boats with their a**** hanging over in just 12 foot tinnies. 'They take their life into their own hands up there.' Describing his own frightening encounters with the crocodiles, he added: 'I've been checking a motor on a boat and within seconds the crocs are surrounding you. 'It's the ones you don't see that you should worry about.' He said that anyone visiting the South Alligator River should think twice about the size of the boat they are going in. 'If you go with a tour you are pretty safe but if you go on your own boat you need at least a 16ft boat. 'If you've got a few people on anything like a 14ft boat you are asking for trouble. 'When we catch Barramundi there we swing them over the boat and drag them alongside to get the water back in their gills before letting them go. That is dangerous. There are always several pairs of eyes watching. 'What this man was doing, I don't know.' It is thought the man, his wife, son and daughter-in-law were in a fishing boat outside of crocodile-management zones patrolled by rangers . The attack happened at Kakadu National Park's (pictured) South Alligator River . The man was attacked by a croc on South Alligator River while he was with his wife, son and daughter-in-law . Jabiru Police, Gunbalanya Police, officers from the Water Police Section and Park Rangers continued their search for the man and the crocodile on Sunday morning after searching with spotlights through the night. 'At this time we have eight people down there and we'll be ramping that up if we don't locate the gentleman during the night,' NT police Superintendent Bob Harrison said on Saturday. Northern Territory police were initially searching a billabong near the river at Kakadu National Park, but efforts were narrowed to the southern area of Alligator Creek, according to Nine News Darwin. 'Look we always hold out hope but obviously a crocodile attack is very serious and there are grave concerns,' Supt Harrison told ABC on Saturday. 'I believe the son was involved in the initial search for his father, which is obviously traumatising and anyone's heart would go out to the family in that sort of incident.' Unless people who are snatched by crocodiles are found alive within the first minutes, officials admit there is very little chance of them surviving. The family were being comforted by police and medical officials late last night. Authorities are stunned by reports that the man had been grabbed by the crocodile while he was on a boat - a situation that is usually considered safe. The man was attacked by a saltwater crocodile - one of the most feared and dangerous creatures on earth. On Saturday night, Northern Territory Minister for Parks and Wildlife Bess Price said her thoughts were with the family and friends of the man. The unusual incident happened on South Alligator River, near the town of Cooinda - about 300km east of Darwin . At least eight people are part of the search team, with numbers boosted after the man was not found on Saturday night . She also wished good luck and safety for the police and park rangers who were determined to continue searching for the man through the night in the slight chance that he has been able to get away from the reptile and swim to a river bank. Cooinda is a popular tourist area in the heart of the World Heritage-listed Kakadu National Park - where the original Crocodile Dundee movie was shot. The tiny township is on the banks of the Yellow Water Billabong, described as one of the world's most spectacular wetlands. Cooinda is the main access point for the Yellow Water Cruise, which travels along Jim Jim Creek and the South Alligator River. The area is particularly popular among bird watchers, but many tourists hope that they will be able to see crocodiles from the safety of their boat.","The man's remains were found on Sunday inside a 4.7m long saltwater crocodile shot by NT police .

"Anthony Taylor thought that proposing to his girlfriend Stephanie Walker underwater during a scuba dive would be an unforgettable romantic gesture - but it almost had a tragic ending when she was so surprised she nearly drowned. Luckily, instructors were on hand to help the shocked woman recover, and when she had regained her composure she accepted the proposal. Mr Taylor, 27, and Miss Walker, 26, from Wolverhampton, were on holiday in the Turkish resort of Marmaris in August last year when he decided to propose. Scroll down for video . Proposal: Anthony Taylor holds up a sign asking his girlfriend Stephanie Walker to marry him while they are on a scuba dive in the Mediterranean . Couple: Mr Taylor and Ms Walker have been together for a year after meeting on a night out in Wolverhampton . He approached scuba diving instructors, who helped him make a laminated card with the words 'Will you marry me?' written on it. When they were 40ft below the surface of the water, Mr Taylor showed the card to Miss Walker - making her gasp and filling her mask with water. The instructors helped ensure that she was safe, then handed her another laminated card to give her response as Mr Taylor held out a diamond ring. After she accepted the proposal, the newly engaged couple returned to dry land, where they were greeted by a crowd of well-wishers. Shock: Miss Walker gasped and let water into her mask, casing her to start choking . 'We had mentioned marriage before but I had no idea he was going to do it then,' Miss Walker said. 'We had never been scuba diving before so it was a once in a lifetime chance really. 'We had air tanks and masks on and were both waving at a camera while posing with the fish. 'Then there was a tap on my shoulder. I turned to see my other half with a blackboard bearing the hand-written message ""Will you marry me?"" 'The guide quickly handed me a board which had ""yes"" on one side. I turned it over to check but it said ""yes"" on both sides! 'It was literally completely out of the blue. We were told by the instructors before ""Don't breath though your nose"", but when he proposed I definitely did and suddenly everything filled up with water. Helping out: An instructor stepped in to ensure that Miss Walker was safe and re-adjust her mask . Rock: Mr Taylor held out a diamond engagement ring as a scuba diving instructor looked on . 'Luckily we had the instructors on hand because they were all in on it. They sorted me out and we got back to the boat. 'It was scary when the mask filled up with water but there so many people around us it was over quickly. 'The instructors all seemed to know what they were doing, and slipped the ring to Anthony while they fixed my mask. 'Once . I was capable of breathing again, I saw the ring and Anthony put it on . my finger. I still can't believe that is how he decided to propose.' Mr . Taylor, a kitchen manufacturer who was on his first holiday abroad, . described how he was inspired to think up his unusual proposal. Unusual: The scene 40ft below the surface of the sea was witnessed by a number of passing fishes . 'I was originally going to propose to Stephanie over dinner, or on the beach,' he said. 'But then I got a bit creative. 'I had bought the ring before we set off on holiday. And when I went to book the scuba diving trip, it got me thinking. I drew up the signs with the instructors beforehand. 'Stephanie needed some help with her mask after she saw the sign. She had water in her goggles but I knew she would be OK.' The couple - who met on a night out in Wolverhampton a year ago - plan to get married in September 2015.

"One spring day about 42,000 years ago, a herd of woolly mammoths was grazing near what would one day be called the Yuribey river in northwestern Siberia. Back then, during the Late Pleistocene age, this was no frozen wasteland but fertile steppe, with plenty of succulent grasses and plants for the huge mammals to feast on. Munching with the herd was a mother accompanied by her newborn calf. Scroll down for video . Perfectly preserved: Lyuba, who froze in what is now Siberia thousands of years ago, is unpacked in London . Fascinating: Lyuba, the baby mammoth (pictured) is the star attraction of the Natural History Museum's Ice Age exhibition. Experts thinks she fell into a sticky mud hole and choked to death, leaving her mother to grieve for her, 42,000 years ago . At just a month old, the tiny female was too young to eat foliage and instead was relying on a combination of her mother’s milk and excrement. At some point the mother approached the river, either to wade and drink or simply to cross it with the rest of the herd. It was a move that would prove disastrous for her calf. The banks were a sticky wet mass of sand and clay. The adult mammoths, standing up to 11ft tall, could easily plough through the quagmire but for this young Mammuthus primigenius, just 33 inches high, the banks were perilous. Within seconds the calf became trapped. Desperately she tried to free herself, but as she twisted and contorted her body was only embedded deeper into the mud. It is likely that the calf called out to her mother, who would have come charging towards her baby. But if such maternal help did arrive, it came too late. The riverbank swiftly claimed its victim, filling the calf’s throat with mud and choking the poor creature to death. The mother surely wanted to stay but the herd was moving on and she had to move with it. Such cruel events have been common in Nature for millions of years. Doubtless many young mammoths perished in such a way, as some baby elephants do today. But there is something special about this particular Ice Age mammoth. For, from tomorrow, visitors to the Natural History Museum in London will be able to see her almost perfectly preserved and complete remains. A desperate death: Scientists believe that Lyuba (pictured) fell into a mud hole beside an ancient river bank and choked to death. The baby mammoth's trunk, mouth, oesophagus and trachea were all clogged with sediment, suggesting she choked to death or was asphyxiated . The world's most complete mammoth has gone on show at London's Natural History Museum. Here, the ancient animal is in her custom case being transported to the museum . It's as if she is sleeping: The baby mammoth (pictured) was plucked from the Siberian permafrost where she has hidden for 42,000 years . Astonishingly, despite lying in the Siberian wilderness for about 420 centuries, the calf — called ‘Lyuba’ — looks as though she died only a few weeks ago. Although most of her hair has rotted away, leaving her looking more like her cousin the elephant, she is the most intact mammoth ever found. While the discovery tells us much about how her species lived, this 50kg prehistoric carcass also reveals, as we shall see, plenty about the greedy nature of Man. And it raises an extraordinary question: could some of this baby’s DNA be extracted and the mammoth brought back to life? Lyuba was found exactly seven years ago by a Siberian reindeer breeder called Yuri Khudi, who was on a hunting expedition with his three sons. When he first spotted the bald corpse on a sandbar in the river, Yuri initially suspected that she was an elephant. However, it quickly dawned on him that he had made an amazing discovery — an entire mammoth. Most people would have rejoiced at such a find, but this hunter was less than thrilled. Yuri is one of the nomadic Nenets people, who regard finding mammoth remains as bad luck. Scientists examined Lyuba's baby teeth to discover that she spent 22 months in the womb - the same amount of time as a modern elephant. A 'growth line' (labelled) in the dentine shows she was born in spring and was just 35 days old when she die . Members of the public will be able to see Lyuba's pristinely preserved body when it forms the centrepiece of an exhibition called Mammoths: Ice Age Giant, which opens on 23 May. It will run until 7 September. A close-up of her eye area is pictured . According to their folklore, mammoths are controlled by underworld gods and in some instances can bring an early death to those who touch them. Despite his misgivings, Yuri knew that what he had stumbled across was important, so he drove his snowmobile some 90 miles across the permafrost to a town called Novyy Port, from where he boarded a helicopter to take him to Yar-Sale, the capital of the Yamal Peninsula. There, Yuri visited the director of the museum, who decided to act quickly. Within hours Yuri, the director and some policemen flew to the spot where the mammoth was lying — only to find that it had disappeared. While Yuri despaired, the sceptical director and policemen flew back to Yar-Sale. Keen to prove that he was not a fantasist, Yuri made some enquiries and it soon emerged that the mammoth had been taken by his cousin, who had sold it to a shopkeeper in Novyy Port for two years’ supplies of food. Yuri rushed to the store, where he saw the mammoth carelessly propped up on the floor.  Some stray dogs had chewed  off most of an ear and the mammoth’s tail. Yuri managed to persuade the shop owner that his purchase was too important to be treated as a giant canine chew, and with the assistance of local police the baby was taken to the Shemanovsky Museum in Salekhard. The exhibition is the first opportunity for people to see the baby mammoth (pictured) in Europe and it also includes realistic life-sized models and skeletons of mammoths and their relatives . Lyuba the baby mammoth (pictured) who is housed in a glass case in the exhibition, measures 33inches (85cm) tall and 51 inches (130cm) long - a little larger than a dog . Professor Lister said that ancient humans used mammoths for much more than food and there is a 'lot of evidence of interaction'. Tusks were used for carving into spearheads, bone was used in the construction of huts in central Europe and fur for warmth. Here, a Colombian mammoth is pictured alongside a tiger . It was there that the mammoth was named Lyuba, after Yuri’s wife. She was reportedly less than delighted, as she too shared the Nenets’ belief that mammoth corpses are bad omens. The find caused shockwaves across the academic community. Scans showed that not only was the exterior of Lyuba’s body more or less whole, but so too were her internal organs. Her throat and lungs showed traces of mud and clay, which proved that she had been asphyxiated. Lyuba’s intestine also revealed that she had been eating excrement, perhaps that of her mother. For students of giant mammals this was not a surprising detail, as today’s elephants do the same, in order to build up the necessary microbes needed to digest plant matter. On her exterior, scientists were also intrigued to discover that Lyuba’s trunk has two small flaps, or flanges, that have been seen once before on the remains of the trunk of an adult mammoth. Nobody knows exactly what these were for, though some scientists speculate that they might have been used for scooping snow. The researchers also unearthed clues to how Lyuba had been so fantastically preserved. It appeared that lactobacillus microbes in the water had actually pickled her body, which was then frozen in the permafrost. Lyuba's body was preserved when it sank into mud which later froze. It has been buried for 40,000 years in a vacuum, which has meant that oxygen has not decomposed the remains . The little mammoth was discovered near the Yuribei River (marked) in Siberia, Russia in May 2007 . Now that she is on display, Lyuba is no longer frozen and is instead preserved in Formalin, and flown around the world in what resembles a large executive briefcase. At 33in (85cm) tall and 51in (130cm) long, Lyuba is little larger than a dog. Because she almost looks asleep, it is tempting to wonder whether creatures such as Lyuba really could be cloned and brought back to life in a Pleistocene version of Jurassic Park. Dr Victoria Herridge, the Natural History Museum’s dwarf elephant expert, has her doubts. ‘In order to produce a clone of Lyuba,’ she says, ‘you would need to have really high-quality nuclear DNA [located within the nucleus of cells]. However, because Lyuba did partially decompose before the pickling and freezing process, there is too much cell and DNA damage to make cloning viable.’ What’s more, like many experts, Dr Herridge also has severe ethical doubts about any attempt to bring back the mammoth. The discovery by Lyuba Yuri Khudi and his sons, one of whom is pictured with the mammoth, was a complete accident . The discovery in 2007 caused excitement in the scientific community because of Lyuba's completeness. Here, scientists make observations in Siberia where the body was found . To do so would involve using an Asian elephant as a surrogate mother, which would be subjected to a lifetime of testing and invasive procedures. ‘Don’t forget,’ says Dr Herridge, ‘mammoths are about as closely related to elephants as we are to chimpanzees. Implanting a mammoth into an elephant would therefore be like implanting a chimpanzee into a human female.’ Dr Herridge also wonders what recreating the mammoth would actually achieve in scientific terms. ‘What would we actually learn if we did this?’ she asks. ‘What’s the benefit for humanity?’ Even if we humans are unlikely to bring back the mammoth, it looks as if our fascination with the hairy giant is set to continue. Sadly, however, the reason for this may be more financial than scientific. In the past five years as many mammoths have been unearthed as were found in the previous 50. This is partly due to the melting permafrost, but also because there is now an increasing number of mammoth hunters, who sell mammoth ivory at £350 a kilo. In  a typical year the Chinese alone buy some 60 tonnes of this ivory.","Lyuba was one year old when she froze in what is now northwest Siberia .

"Ian became very angry and very obsessed with his relationship . A bodyguard who protected diplomats and aid workers in warzones committed suicide after his 'sense of bravado' left him unable to cope with his turbulent love life. Twice married Ian Robinson, 37, protected foreign dignitaries during dangerous assignments in Libya and Afghanistan yet back in Britain he became obsessed with saving a crumbling romance. Eventually after a row with ex-girlfriend Melissa Biagini he texted her saying that he had attempted to take his own life, messaging her: 'I’ve tried twice but chickened out'. In the early hours of the following morning the former army corporal was found hanged in his city centre apartment in Manchester by a neighbour. An inquest was told Robinson originally from Ashington, Northumberland, had left the army in 2006 and began working as a private security official where he protected diplomatic and foreign aid workers from the UK. But at home his life had been on a 'downward spiral' due to his obsessions with keeping fit and finding love and he had tried to kill himself after the break-up of his second marriage. Mother-of-one Miss Biagini from St . Albans, Hertfordshire said she and Ian had separated in the summer of . 2012 but they tried to rekindle their romance in January 2013. She . said: 'Everything important to him wasn’t as he wanted it to be. His . training and work and ideas he had for family life were what defined him . as a man and he couldn’t fix it. 'He had frustrations that the relationship wasn’t going the way he wanted. 'He . didn’t have the skills needed to sustain a long-term relationship. We . talked about alternative ways of doing things. Periods of calmness and . kindness were followed by periods of rage. 'It . may not have been a conventional relationship but it is what we had for . so many years. He was reading self-help books and looking for solutions . to problems he had. 'He said he felt very alone and he felt isolated. He said he was alone and hadn’t left the flat and wasn’t eating or washing.' 'He became very angry and very obsessed . with his relationship. He would go from euphoric to catastrophic. The . relationship contributed to his downward spiral.' Ian's mother, Mary Saint . In . the days before his death in May last year Robinson visited Melissa but . returned home shortly afterwards after a row in which he accused of her . dating another man. She added: 'He struggled with the concept that when we were apart I had tried to move forward. 'My . son was out the house and we needed to let the dust settle so he left . and I told him it wasn’t the end of the world and he needed to get some . help because I couldn’t fix this. 'I . spoke to him for the last time on Saturday evening and he was screaming . down the phone.' His mother Mary Saint, a mental health professional with 36 years experience told the Manchester hearing: 'He was initially very happy with his role in close protection and he had a great sense of pride and professionalism. 'He always extremely physical - like an athlete. Training was his life. He would train five to six hours a day. For the work he did he had to be very fit so he would always be in the gym. 'But later his mood deteriorated and he wasn’t getting the sense of job satisfaction he used to. He had difficulties with his back from the beginning of 2013 and that impacted hugely on his ability to train. 'He needed long periods of rest but exercise was very important to him and it was a great part of his wellbeing. 'He didn’t have an outlet if he was feeling frustrated and angry and couldn’t go to the gym. When he couldn’t train he was like a caged bear. 'He became very angry and very obsessed with his relationship. He would go from euphoric to catastrophic. The relationship contributed to his downward spiral. 'By the nature of the job he was doing it is difficult for people with emotional difficulties to seek help because it would be professional suicide.' Mrs Saint said Ian was determined to make his relationship work despite the protests of family and friends. She spoke to him two weeks before his death where he said he wasn’t able to deal with the break-up of his relationship and how it wasn’t as he wanted it. She added: 'When his second marriage broke up he came to see me and I was aware he had attempted to take his own life. 'Part of my job is to assess suicidal risk and intention and I thought it was a serious attempt.' His father Alan Robinson said: 'On the Tuesday before his death I spoke to him and could tell he was in a low mood and I asked him what was wrong. He said he was in Manchester by himself and had no friends and couldn’t train. 'I said ""come home - your family and friends and everyone will help you through this"". He said ""no"" and I found out the next day he had gone to see Melissa. 'I told him he had to bite the bullet and move on and said ""someone else will give you a chance of happiness"". He said he couldn’t because he loved her.' Recording a verdict of suicide, coroner Sara Lewis told Mr Robinson’s family: 'He was in a difficult relationship which was clearly having a negative effect on his wellbeing but he couldn’t walk away from it. 'That was compounded by the injury he sustained to his back which was preventing him from training to his normal level. His training was an outlet for him and central to his emotional wellbeing to the extent that he was almost obsessed. 'There was a picture of a deteriorating wellbeing and I accept that his family and friends urged him to get help but for reasons including the potential effect on his career he didn’t feel able to seek that help.' After the inquest, his father Alan said friends will be taking part in the Northumberland coastal challenge marathon to raise money for Help for Heroes in memory of Ian. There will also be a ‘Robbo Memorial’ cricket match held at Newbiggin Hall in Northumberland.

"A Minnesota radio host has sparked an online firestorm after he said live on air that he'd like to tell the families of the Sandy Hook Elementary school shooting victims to 'go to hell' for infringing on his rights to own a gun. Bob Davis, one half of the outspoken 'Davis & Emmer,' show on Twin Cities News Talk AM, was discussing gun control when he made the outrageous comment about the Newtown, Connecticut tragedy earlier this month. 'I'm sick and tired of seeing these victims trotted out, given rides on Air Force One, hauled into the Senate well, and everyone is just afraid -- they're terrified of these victims,' he said. '... I would stand in front of them and tell them, ""Go to hell.""' SCROLL DOWN TO LISTEN . Shocking: Bob Davis is one half of the 'Davis & Emmer,' show on Twin Cities News Talk AM . The horrific shooting on December 14, 2012, left 26 people dead, including 20 six or seven-year-olds. Davis' heinous rant, which begins just over six minutes into the above segment, was targeted at the victims' families, some of which have been vocal in the months since the shooting as advocates for tighter gun controls. 'I have something I want to say to the victims of Newtown, or any other shooting,' Davis said, according to Minneapolis' City Pages blog. 'I don't care if it's here in Minneapolis or anyplace else. Just because a bad thing happened to you doesn't mean that you get to put a king in charge of my life. I'm sorry that you suffered a tragedy, but you know what? Deal with it, and don't force me to lose my liberty, which is a greater tragedy than your loss.' The remarks prompted scores of angry comments from shocked listeners, with most claiming the hosts were 'despicable' and should be 'ashamed' of themselves.

I hope your sponsors bail on you as fast as they can and your show vanishes. You help nothing with your hate.' A few days after the vicious tirade, Davis addressed his outraged listeners, but stopped short of an apology. '... here's what you need to know and what some of you already know about me is that, ah, this is not a contrived show, I do not hide behind flowery language I do not pull my punches, when I'm passionate about something it comes out on the air, it's real and it will always be that way,' he said.

"Serial killer: Harold Shipman murdered between 215 and 260 of his patients using the drug Diamorphine over a period of 20 years . Human remains from some of serial killer Harold Shipman’s victims were kept for more than a decade by police before they were secretly destroyed without the families’ permission, it has emerged. The samples were taken from 12 women to establish cause of death, police said. They were kept in storage for a number of years to ensure that police had the appropriate evidence should the murderer or his family appeal against his conviction. But in 2011 police decided to 'respectfully dispose' of the tissue samples without telling the families. The remains were taken to an incinerator and burned on February 16, that year, without ceremony. Police only told the victims' families what they had done recently when they realised a local newspaper reporter had found out about it. Greater Manchester Police chief constable Sir Peter Fahy said officers 'agonised' over whether or not to tell the families but decided not to, to save them reliving 'upset and distress'. The remains belonged to Kathleen Grundy, Joan Melia, Winifred Mellor, Bianka Pomfret, Ivy Lomas, Marie Quinn, Irene Turner, Jean Lilley, Muriel Grimshaw, Alice Kitchen, Elizabeth Mellor and Sally Ashworth. Their bodies were exhumed during the Shipman investigation in the late 1990s. Sir Peter Fahy said: 'This was not a decision that we took lightly, in fact it was a decision that we agonised over for a number of months with a number of independent advisory groups, partner agencies and other professionals. Victims: The remains which were incinerated belonged to (clockwise from top left) Norah Nuttall, 65, Jean Lilley, 59, Marie West, 81, Bianka Pomfret, 49, Joan Melia, 73, and Kathleen Grundy, 81 . Victims: The other six people the remains belonged to were (clockwise from top left) Irene Turner, 67, Lizzie Adams, 77, Winifred Mellor, 73, Pamela Hillier, 68, Kathleen Wagstaff, 81, and Maureen Ward, 57 . 'I would hope that the public would understand that this was a very difficult decision for us to make but I want to assure people that we made this decision for the right reasons. 'It was never our intention to cause the families any pain or distress. These families had not only experienced the upset of losing a family member but had had to relive it in the glare of the media and the public time and time again - that is something that most people will thankfully never have to experience. 'A number of years had passed since the trial and Shipman’s death and was it right for us to cause even more upset and distress by making the families relive this yet again? 'No part of any murder investigation is simple and every decision is made with the best of intentions; how much should we tell families? How much do they want to know? The facts of any such case are distressing enough but do we add to this with even more detail? These are questions that officers are faced with on a daily basis. Appeal: Police kept the remains in case Primrose Shipman, the wife of the serial killer, decided to appeal against his conviction years after his death . Victim: The grave of Kathleen Grundy (left) who sparked the murder investigation. Her daughter went to police after Mrs Grundy's will was altered in favour of Dr Shipman. The probe uncovered a number of suspicious deaths. Pictured right is Joe Kitchen, the son of Alice Kitchen, who was a victim of Dr Shipman . 'As soon as we knew that a journalist had become aware of this, specially trained officers visited all of the families involved and fully explained our rationale which they all took on board and fully understood. We now continue to support these families as they are now forced to relive the hurt and upset yet again.' Shipman, the UK’s most prolific convicted serial killer, was jailed for life in 2000 for murdering 15 patients using the drug Diamorphine while working in Hyde, Greater Manchester. Nine of these victims were exhumed and three other victims who were not in the court case also had their remains dug up. Police said that some human tissue was retained as evidence until a meeting in October 2007 when they decided to hold on to the samples for another five years, in case of any further legal challenge by Shipman's widow Primrose. The decision was reviewed in 2010, after . the Association of Chief Police Officers asked all police forces to . conduct an audit of human tissue in storage in the wake of the Human . Tissue Act. A force spokeswoman said that since there had been no legal challenges, the decision was taken to 'respectfully dispose' of the human tissue in February 2011. An inquiry concluded he killed between 215 and 260 people over a 23-year period in Hyde and Todmorden, West Yorkshire. He committed suicide in January 2004.","Police kept body parts from 12 women after exhuming them in the late 1990s .

"It’s been another interesting week for us at Matchroom Boxing, where we have added Nathan Cleverly to the team. Nathan is a fighter I respect enormously and I can reveal some of the big plans I have for him. He will be fighting on May 17 in Cardiff and it is my hope to put him out one more time after that before a winter fight with Tony Bellew. That fight is huge and, as it stands, I have pencilled in Liverpool in November. If they both keep winning, then they have a massive fight to look forward to and ultimately a final eliminator to a crack at the cruiserweight world title. Obviously their first fight, which Nathan won, was in Liverpool, Tony’s backyard, but credit to Nathan who is happy to go there again as it has the most suitable venue. We could do Cardiff again, but the venue there holds 5,000 – this fight is bigger than that. It is a fight built on animosity and rivalry – there is no pretend table flipping. It’s a genuine domestic grudge match. New arrival: Nathan Cleverly has joined forces with Matchroom ahead of his cruiserweight debut in May . For me, personally, it is great to be working with Nathan. For someone so young – 27 – he has already achieved so much in the sport. Since losing his light-heavyweight world title last year he has taken his time working out what he wants to do in the sport and what is his best way forward. He is the kind of guy who needs to get excited about the sport again. He wants to feel the buzz, to get exposure and raise his profile and this move has enabled that. It is a new journey for him. He has come up to cruiserweight and I think that is smart. It is an accessible division. We have a great relationship with the Sauerland promotion team and they have a huge foothold on the cruiserweight division. They have WBO world champion Marco Huck and Yoan Pablo Hernandez, the IBF champion, on their books so we are in a strong position in terms of making those fights down the line and these talks are already taking place. It is interesting for both Nathan and Tony at the moment. The way I look at it, as a promoter, is that I have two things I have to deliver for my fighter. Number one is to plot the best path to a world title and the other is to deliver the fight that is most lucrative for them. As it happens, the most lucrative and biggest fight for both Nathan and Tony right now is to fight each other. I could deliver either of them a world title fight tomorrow, but there is no rush. I am happy for both guys to settle into the division first, have two fights each – I will probably look to get Tony out again at the end of June or early July as he hurt his hand in his last fight – and then they can fight each other. After that, the winner will go after titles. Again: Nathan Cleverly (right) is set to face Tony Bellew (left) in November in a long-awaited remach . Bitter: The pair have one of the most heated rivalries in boxing having made their dislike of one another clear . Same result? Cleverly edged out Bellew three years ago and is prepared to return to Liverpool . At the moment we are still looking at opponents for Nathan on May 17. Tony’s last opponent, Valery Brudov, was sort of a gatekeeper for the elite of the division - a tough test against a good fighter. We will be looking at a similar test for Nathan. Tony has passed his first test in the division and now Nathan has to do the same. Then we will have something really special to look forward to in the winter. Fights involving British fighters that don’t like each other definitely sell. At the same time, though, they are ambassadors for their sport and they need to behave. I do have concerns. That is something we will have to deal with closer to the time. I also have concerns about Carl Froch and George Groves being in a room together and as their fight draws closer it’s something we have to plan carefully. That is when you know you have a huge fight because it is all so real. I think the public sees through fake hype, but the public know how much Tony and Nathan don’t like each other. They just need to make sure they do nothing silly before going in the ring. I’ll make that clear to both fighters – ultimately they are role models and have to be professional. Fine start: Tony Bellew began his cruiserweight campaign with a stoppage victory over Valery Brudov . Our Cardiff bill on May 17, on which Cleverly features, will be co-headlined by Lee Selby. The Welshman, who is British and Commonwealth featherweight champion, is a real sensation. He is currently ranked No 3 by the WBC, No 6 with the IBF and No 10 by the WBO and No 12 with the WBA. He is going places fast. I can reveal we are lining up a WBC title eliminator for that May show with Mexican featherweight Romulo Koasicha, who is 21-3. That will hopefully manoeuvre Lee into a WBC world title shot later this year. One to watch: Welshman Lee Selby is one of the rising stars of British boxing . Over in the States next week is Manny Pacquiao and Timothy Bradley. I feel like Pacquiao is treading water a bit now. One thing that often happens when you miss the big fight that everyone wants, like he has with Floyd Mayweather, sometimes you stop being relevant. That seems to be happening a bit with Pacquiao. I don’t mean that to sound disrespectful – Pacquiao will never be irrelevant. But his stock has been affected by getting knocked out by Juan Manuel Marquez, which followed an unfair points loss against Timothy Bradley. He came back with a win against Brandon Rios but that’s not too much to shout about in the grand scheme of his career. This Bradley fight is interesting. Pacquiao simply has to win for the sake of his career and he is against a fighter in Bradley who is hugely underrated. Bradley doesn’t get the most recognition because he doesn’t have the biggest personality and he doesn’t carry the hype of his fellow contenders, But he is an extremely dangerous fighter and he is great at adapting in the ring, which is why he is unbeaten in 31. Tough task: Manny Pacquiao will bid to avenge his controversial defeat to Timothy Bradley on April 12 . Doubt: Pacquiao remains convinced he won the first fight with Bradley two years ago . My time: Bradley wants to be Pacquiao again to convince people he deserved the first victory . I actually think Bradley is the favourite going in against Pacquiao. He is the fresher, younger fighter and, unlike Pacquiao, he has never been knocked out. Bradley is not a huge puncher, but he is just too fresh for a great fighter who appears to be sliding. If Pacquiao does lose, I really don’t think there is a way back for him. If he wins, then let’s all hope that he can finally get it on with Mayweather, albeit for a fraction of the money he would have made if that fight had happened a few years ago. I’m like all boxing fans in that regard – it was a fight I desperately wanted to see. But you need to fully appreciate how bad the rivalry is between Golden Boy, who promote Mayweather, and Top Rank, who deal with Pacquiao. They seem hell bent on never working together.

"A year ago Andy Murray went to Wimbledon as a British hopeful with the burden of ‘not since Fred Perry’ on his shoulders. He ended the 77-year hoodoo, walked away with the crown, and so this year returns with a new challenge: a rematch with destiny and the tough task of keeping his title. In the Open era only Bjorn Borg, Boris Becker, Pete Sampras and Roger Federer have been able to follow a first SW19 singles title with a second the following year. As a boxing fan, Murray was transfixed recently by another rematch which he hopes will help him. ‘I am a huge fan of boxing, so obviously I really enjoyed the Carl Froch and George Groves fights,’ he says. Sealed with a kiss: Andy Murray celebrates winning Wimbledon last year . Champion: Andy Murray will start the defence of his Wimbledon title against Belgian David Goffin . Golden moment: Andy Murray beat Novak Djokovic (right) to win his first Wimbledon title last year . ‘The training and mentality you need for boxing isn’t too far from what it’s like to be a tennis player: you have to be physically strong but also mentally; you can’t give anything away before you compete and both fighters did this perfectly. ‘[In their first fight last year] they kept everyone guessing right up to the point Groves knocked Froch down. It was a great advert for British boxing. I thought both boxers demonstrated incredible attitudes throughout, particularly in the run-up to the second fight at Wembley. ‘Carl Froch had massively underestimated Groves in the first fight, a mistake that he learnt from, and returned stronger and better than we had ever seen before. Learning from your mistakes is one of the most important things to do. ‘I really enjoyed the never-say-die attitude from Groves in securing the rematch, he fought hard to get Froch to fight him again, and although it didn’t quite work I think he gained a lot of people’s respect, which is important in any sport. The most important message I will take away from those fights is to always have that attitude: fight till the bitter end and believe in yourself.’ Practice: Defending Wimbledon champion Andy Murray trained with new coach Amelie Mauresmo on Friday . No scapegoat: Andy Murray insists it won't be his new coach's fault if he crashes out early . Taking a breather: Murray looks up at new coach Mauresmo as she chats with him in between practice . Murray, 27, has heard plenty of stories about what it’s like to defend a Wimbledon title, not least from new coach Amelie Mauresmo, who won the women’s singles in SW19 in 2006. ‘Pure joy,’ is how the Frenchwoman described it. ‘Of course there is a goal of winning again and focusing on the game and what to do on the court, and how to behave,’ she added. ‘But I feel first of all it’s joy, and being so proud to be there to defend the title.’ Murray has heard that you return to Centre Court with a zip in your step, confidence pulsing through you and in the certain knowledge that you have what it takes to win the most prestigious event in the world. ‘It’s a different feeling this year,’ he says. ‘After spending so many years wanting to win and not, I always put a lot of pressure on myself heading into the Championships. But after finally finding the breakthrough last year, I think I’m definitely more relaxed. Down and out: George Groves is stopped by Carl Froch in their second fight at Wembley Stadium last month . Brutal battle: Carl Froch and George Groves gave everything in their two fights against each other . ‘This year I’m just looking forward to going out and enjoying playing tennis as the defending champion, but they’ll still be plenty of pressure from me to win!’ Retaining his crown will be no easy task. Eighteen men have won the Wimbledon single’s title for the first time in the open era of tennis since 1968, and only four of them have followed up by retaining their title the next year. That quartet names are a roll call of some of the greatest players the game has known, all of them titans on grass in their pomp. Borg, Becker, Sampras and Federer have won 48 Grand Slam singles titles between them, 22 of those at Wimbledon . ‘I’ve heard from a few of the guys that returning as defending champion is very special,’ Murray says. ‘The British fans are always incredible and I’m sure they will all be just as fired up this year. My mindset heading out onto Centre Court on the first day will still be the same as it has been every year. This tournament means everything to me, and I will be giving everything I can to go all the way again.’ Pure joy: Amelie Mauresmo celebrates after winning the women's final at Wimbledon in 2006 . So intense, so tumultuous was last year’s win, Murray barely took it in. He returned alone on the Monday to Centre Court to let it sink in. ‘It was a funny feeling,’ he says. ‘It was literally just me, so the contrast from the day before was incredible. ‘I couldn’t remember much about the final game, so being able to just stand on the court, I was able to reflect on the day before, I even tried to replay a few of the points in my head.’ Mauresmo takes over where Ivan Lendl left off as Murray’s coach. They could not be more different. Asked if she too would sit in the players’ box, unsmiling, shades on, stern and authoritarian, she can but laugh at the thought. Then she sits up in the chair, pretending for a split second to be steely. ‘So I have to sit up straight?’ she asks. ‘It’s tough to compare Ivan and me. We are so different in every way. I don’t . know Ivan very well. I know him through Andy’s eyes. I don’t think I . will bring him the same as Ivan. Which is good, because Ivan brought him . a lot and maybe I can bring him different things.’ Suits you: Andy Murray poses with former coach Ivan Lendl after winning Wimbledon last year . Dynamic duo: Andy Murray hugs Ivan Lendl in the players box after beating Novak Djokovic last year . Dynamic duo: Lendl and Murray proved a successful partnership, winning Wimbledon and the US Open . Lendl, says Mauresmo, made Murray more consistent, physically, against the biggest opponents. ‘And something else was helping him [overcome] the finals he lost in Grand Slams. And finally finding the switch to make it happen.’ Her role, she says, will be more about psychology, at least immediately. ‘Andy’s DNA is not going to change drastically in the way he plays . . . on grass, playing the final in 2012, winning the Olympics, winning last year, he knows how to do this stuff.’ Instead it seems she will help him remain calm on the court, on top of the demons that sometimes hurt his chances in his youth. She will also share the bad times she had at her own home Slam, Roland Garros, and how she felt crushed by pressure, and arguably under-achieved over the span of her career. ‘Sharing my experience, sharing what I felt, these moments. Sharing maybe the mistakes that I made,’ is how she describes what she is doing.It was interesting to share these feelings and maybe help him try to avoid [negative thoughts]. His career is moving on and he’s learning many things . . . I should have done things a little bit differently at some points and hopefully he can learn from my mistakes.'

"It was the launchpad for the Beatles' unprecedented musical career, demolished in 1973 only to spring up again next door as a working venue once more. But now the Cavern Club in Liverpool, a famous haunt where the Fab Four played nearly 300 times, is up for sale. The club forms part of the Cavern Walks Shopping Centre in the centre of the city, which has been put on the market with a guide price of £1million for the whole centre. History: The Cavern was the club where the Beatles made their name - here (from left to right) George Harrison, Paul McCartney and John Lennon can be seen playing their final gig at the venue . Leathers: The club also played host to the band's earlier look, featuring leather jackets. In those days the band had yet to recruit Ringo Starr, and had Pete Best on drums instead . Trendy: The Cavern, as pictured here before demolition, was a central part of the Liverpool music scene . Although the business which runs the venue will not be affected, as its lease extends to 2028, the owners of the property will change with the sale. It has been offered by owners Warner Estate, who filed for administration in August, The Times reported. The club was frequented by the Fab Four in the early 1960s, before they shot to international fame. In the beginning the venue would pay them just £3, 15 shillings per gig. They played there mainly with drummer Pete best, as Ringo Starr had yet to join the band. It was not a licensed venue, so sold soft drinks and food while acts were playing, and was popular with teenagers. The early gigs also played host to a very different band than the one which would come to dominate pop music. Rebuilt: The Cavern, pictured as it is now, with the doorway in the same spot, has been put up for sale as part of a £1million deal . Continuation: The club is still a thriving venue . Legacy: A famous feature of the cavern is a wall with names of all the bands who played there written on it. Sir Paul McCartney is pictured here in front of in in 1999 . Back on stage: Former Beatle Sir Paul took to the stage again, alongside Pink Floyd guitarist Dave Gilmour, in 1999 . In those days the boys wore leather jackets and blue jeans - which almost got George Harrison kicked out of the club for breaching the dress code. The would also swear, smoke and eat on stage, and sometimes stop mid-song - in stark contrast to the slick and clean image that later propelled them to stardom. John Lennon later said of the years playing the club: 'In those old Cavern days, half the . thing was just ad lib, what you’d call comedy. We just used to mess . about, jump into the audience, do anything.' Trendy: The club was a mainstay of the Liverpool social circuit in the '60s . Dancing: The underground club was often full of revellers listening to the latest hits . As well as being an early stomping ground where the band would hone their performance, the club was also where the band were discovered by manager Brian Epstein, who managed their ascent and helped develop their signature style. The club as it stood in the 60s was eventually demolished in 1973 to make way for a railway development, but was re-founded in the 1980s on almost the exact same site with many of the original bricks. The club which helped foster The Beatles' career also played host to other classic acts in the 1960s and 1970s, including the Rolling Stones, the Yardbirds, The Kinks and The Who. But the underground club was forced to close in 1973 to make way for a rail development. The site was left dormant until it was bought in the early 1980s for redevelopment. Liverpool football player Tommy Smith, along a business partner, signed the new lease on the club and opened in in April 1984 - the same time the Cavern Walks shopping centre opened. The new club, built deeper underground than the original, occupies 75 per cent of the original site, and was rebuilt using 15,000 bricks saved from the demolition. The club closed due to financial pressures in 1989, but was reopened in 1991 by Dave Jones and Bill Heckle, who have run the club for the past 22 years and ensured live music plays most nights. Today's pop royalty have picked up the baton of performing there - acts including Adele, Jessie J and The Wanted have played there in recent years.","Underground club saw 300 performances by The Beatles in the early 1960s .

"A 'nurse' is being investigated after posting pictures on Facebook of herself standing over an apparently dead patient and asking people to guess if she is alive. The woman, who was dressed in a nurse's uniform, called herself the 'soul thief' and also posted comments including 'Hail Satan'. Authorities in St Gallen, Switzerland, about 85km from Zurich, have now launched an investigation and the public prosecutor said they will then decide whether to press charges. Swiss authorities are now investigating after the woman, dressed as a nurse, posted a picture of an elderly patient and asked Facebook users to guess if she was alive or dead . The unidentified nurse posted pictures of herself licking a blade while wearing a PVC dress and boots . The nurse posed in front of a wall of whips, chains and handcuffs and shows off a corset top, right . In one comment the woman wrote: 'Guess she is asleep or is she dead? Hint: I'm the soul thief', according to Swiss news site 20 Minuten. In another she reportedly wrote: 'Yeah, your time is over. Send them to hell, where some of them belong. The rest goes into a hole for compost fertiliser, hehehe.' The identity of the woman and the patient have not been revealed. Officials are investigating in which nursing or retirement home the photographs were taken. Local media said her Facebook page is full of Satanic symbols and she is friends with more than 2,000 people. Other photographs allegedly include scenes of torture. The 'nurse' has not been identified and it is not known in which residential home the picture was taken . Pictures posted on her Facebook page include images of her dressed in a rubber nurse uniform in front of whips and chains and one of her standing in front of an ambulance . The woman, who goes by the name Ghostinthedark Satania Blaze on the social network site, put four pictures up of the patient lying in a bed, including close ups of the woman's face. In one she is seen leaning on the patient's pillow and smiling. When other Facebook users questioned the woman, she wrote: 'I can put anything I want in my Facebook'. One user wrote: 'Why you put on fb a picture like this? Your boss at work know that?' Another wrote: 'That's messed up and sad at the same time.' But the woman retorted: 'Death is normal people die all the time!' The woman, who calls herself Ghostinthedark Satania Blaze, invited comments on the picture . The Swiss Association of Nurses says it is 'shocked and upset' by the pictures . Other pictures show the woman posing in the snow in front of an ambulance and in others she is dressed in a rubber nurse's uniform with a wall full of sadomasochistic instruments. Matthias Mayrhofer, from the Swiss 'Office for Social Matters', told 20 Minuten: 'We [will consider] concrete action but only if we can know which home of what nursing is concerned.' Margrit Kessler, a member of the Swiss National Council, told the website that rights of a patient have already been 'most severely injured' and called for a criminal investigation. She said a lack of nursing staff mean that the applications of nurses are not always properly reviewed. The Swiss Association of Nurses says it is 'shocked and upset' by the pictures.","The woman posted pictures of the apparently dead patient lying in a bed .

"A mother was left terrified after she walked into her living room and spotted this monster 'Jurassic' sized dragonfly. Rowena Wilkinson, 53, dashed indoors when she heard piercing screams coming from her daughter and her friend. She found an enormous dark green dragonfly - measuring around 8inches long - flying around the room like a 'mini-helicopter'. Scroll down for video . Rowena Wilkinson, 53, from Buckinghamshire, was left terrified when she walked into her living room to see this enormous dragonfly . Mrs Wilkinson, from Weston Turville, near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, said: 'I heard them scream and when I ran in this dragonfly was spiralling round very quickly. 'It sounded like a mini helicopter it was that noisy, it was like a Jurassic monster. 'I didn’t know whether to take a photograph or run but I managed to get close enough to take a few pictures. 'We waited for it to stop a bit and then I had to put my arm through the venetian blinds to open the window so it could get out. ' Mrs Wilkinson’s daughter Molly and her friend Ellie Shelby, both 24, were terrified by the creature last Friday. The mother-of-three saw the enormous beast flying around the room like a 'mini-helicopter' But Miss Shelby’s daughter Isla Parkin, three, was fascinated by the dragonfly. Mother-of-three Mrs Wilkinson, a foley artist for the film industry, added: 'Because Isla is so little she wasn't frightened at all and was going up to the dragonfly, it was quite funny as my daughter and her friend were terrified. 'The whole thing was mental.' Mrs Wilkinson shut the living room door and waited and the black-grey beast flew off. It has not been seen again since. Dragonflies, which have existed on Earth for 325million years, have been threatened by widespread insecticide use, water pollution and the draining of wetlands for housing. But in recent years experts say they are enjoying a resurgence thanks to conservation work and warmer weather. Britain's longest dragonfly is the female of the golden-ringed species which reaches around 8inches. In Great Britain and Ireland there are about 30 species that may be encountered and one that has become extinct. Fifty years ago there were twice as many ponds in Britain as there are today. The draining of agricultural land, filling in and pollution have all contributed to the disappearance of most countryside ponds. Canals have also suffered from pollution, especially by chemicals used on farmland draining into water. The loss of suitable fresh water habitats has affected dragonflies enormously and they are becoming increasingly rare. The Norfolk aeshna, Aeshna isosceles, which can be found living only in the Norfolk Broads, is on the list of Britain's endangered species of insects. However, they have enjoyed a resurgence in numbers in recent years thanks to conservation efforts. No less than seven species have appeared in Britain and five species in Ireland for the first time since 1990, including the Willow Emerald Damselfly. In the UK dragonflies reach a length of about 85 mm and a wingspan of about 120 mm. This is the size for the larger 'Hawker' dragonflies such as the Emperor and Brown Hawker. Damselflies, which are the much smaller and weaker flying relatives of dragonflies, are much smaller. The largest in the UK are the Demoiselles. These have a body length of about 50 mm and a wingspan of about 60mm. The species in the UK fall under these categories:Calopterygidae - DemoisellesCoenagrionidae - Red and Blue/black damselfliesLestidae - Emerald damselfliesPlatycnemididae - White-legged damselfliesAeshnidae - Hawker DragonfliesCordulegastridae - Golden-ringed DragonfliesCorduliidae - Emerald DragonfliesGomphidae - Club-tailed DragonfliesLibellulidae - Chasers, Skimmers and DartersSources: British Dragonfly Society, Young People's Trust For The Environment .","Rowena Wilkinson rushed indoors when she heard her daughter screaming .

"A six-year-old autistic boy missing since early Saturday morning has been reunited with his family after turning up in a homeless encampment four miles from his home in California. Sergio Zepeda disappeared from the home he shares with his mother Augustina Quinteros and her boyfriend Bony Sanchez around 9am on Saturday. He turned up, naked and shivering, outside the tent of homeless man Jose Salmeron, 32, around 4am Sunday morning. Safe and sound: Six-year-old Sergio Zepeda turned up miles from home in a homeless encampment . Quinteros told the Mercury News that her son was watching cartoons on Saturday at their home on the 2,900 block of Rorty Drive in South San Jose and jumping on the couch. She and Sanchez noticed he had gone very quiet and upon investigation found that the garage door was open and the boy was missing. After spending an hour searching for the boy, who Quinteros says has wandered off before but has always been found or returned by himself, the couple called 911. The little boy is autistic and cannot communicate in full sentences, making the search for the boy even more difficult. Police had been searching for little Sergio for hours when Jose salmeron was awoken in the early hours of the morning by scuffling sounds outside his tent. 'I popped out of my tent and I saw a naked person. At first I thought it was an alien, like ET,' Salmeron told the Mercury News. Far from home: Sergio was found four miles from his home, which is on the opposite side of this hill . Stark naked: Jose Salmeron was shocked to find a shivering, naked little boy outside his tent at 4am . Long walk: Little Sergio wandered almost four miles from his home, but police believes he walked over a hill, avoiding main roads . 'I shined my flashlight at him and when I looked closer it was a little boy.' He yelled to others in the encampment, 'Come out, there is a naked boy out here!' When he left home, Sergio was wearing jeans and a Super Mario Brothers t-shirt, but his mother said he was likely to have stripped them off. His feet were dirty and he appeared cold, hungry and thirsty. Salmeron wrapped Sergio in a blanket and gave him some food. 'He wouldn't say anything, but I asked him if he wanted ""agua,"" in Spanish, and he said ""agua."" He was really thirsty,' Salmeron said. Frantic: Augustina Quinteros (left) and her boyfriend Bony Sanchez (right) realized Sergio (back) was missing on Saturday morning . Relief: Sergio's mom Augustina Quinteros and her boyfriend Bony Sanchez were reunited with him at hospital . Meanwhile, helicopters and search and rescue teams combed the area around Sergio's home. One of the people living in the encampment called 911 and the police, after some difficulty locating the encampment, came to pick Sergio up and reunite him with his family. 'It's a happy ending,' San Jose police officer and spokesman Albert Morales told The Mercury. 'We're tremendously fortunate that he was safely found. Here's a six-year-old out in the elements, and he trekked a pretty good distance. We're all just very happy that it ended the way it did.' Sergio was taken to hospital to be examined and was given a clean bill of health by doctors. According to KTVU, police want to nominate Salmeron for a Good Samaritan award, but Salmeron doesn't feel deserving of praise. 'We're not heroes,' Salmeron said. 'It was the only right thing to do. When you see a helpless kid like that, you are supposed to do the right thing, and just call the cops right away. Thank God he didn't get hit by a train, or fall into the water.'","Sergio Zepeda, six, went missing from his home Saturday morning .

"Police in Tennessee are investigating whether human remains found in Decatur County woods on Sunday may be that of murdered nursing student Holly Bobo, whose body has not been found since she disappeared over three years ago. Officials say two people out looking for ginseng came across a human skull in the area, which is 10 miles from the home of Zach Adams, one of two men charged with kidnapping and murdering the 20-year-old. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said it was too early to tell whether the remains could be linked to Bobo, who was last seen on the morning of April 13, 2011, walking into woods with a man in hunting clothes near her family's home in Darden. 'This is someone’s missing loved one but at this point we don’t know who,' District Attorney Matt Stowe told WSMV. Scroll down for video . New break: Police in Tennessee used DNA tests to determine the human remains belonged to the 20-year-old . Scene: Police closed off an area of woods in Decatur County after two people looking for ginseng came across a human skull on Sunday morning . Charged: Zachary Adams (left) and Jason Wayne Autry (right) are suspected of kidnapping and killing Bobo . Adams, 29, and Jason Autry, 39, were both charged with kidnapping and murder in the Bobo case in February. In May, brothers Jeffrey Pearcy and Mark Pearcy have both been charged with accessory after the fact and tampering with evidence. Jeffrey Pearcy allegedly showed a friend cell phone footage of Bobo tied up and crying before her murder. The friend, Sandra King, testified at a preliminary hearing in May that she saw Zachary Adams in the footage. Mrs King also claimed that Jeffrey Pearcy told her that his brother Mark had filmed the incident. 'I seen a woman that was tied up that was crying,' King told the court, WMC reported. 'She was blonde... It looked like Holly Bobo.' Jeffrey Pearcy, left, and Mark Pearcy, right, have both been charged with accessory after the fact and tampering with evidence . Revelations: Witness Sandra King testified at a . preliminary hearing in July that she saw missing student Holly Bobo . tied up and crying in cell phone footage shown to her by Jeffrey Pearcy . King said it appeared the blonde in the video was about to be sexually assaulted, but she did not see. 'I knew what he was fixing to do. I did not want to see,' King said. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation has not seen the video. Jeffrey Pearcy has denied the video exists and agents are now trying to find out if it is on his cell phone. King worked with police to try and have Pearcey acknowledge the video in a phone call. 'I said to him, ""You know that video of Holly, if it would have been you in that video, I would have watched it,"" and he said, ""Yes I know"",' King said. Suspect: Jason Wayne Autry has been charged with the kidnap and murder of Holly Bobo . Loss: Nursing student Holly Bobo was seen being led from her Tennessee home in April 2011 . Threats: Adams appears in court earlier this year over claims he threatened his brother, who is a witness in the case . Both men have pleaded not guilty. Adams was indicted in March on charges of especially aggravated kidnapping and first-degree murder. Autry,was indicted in April on first-degree murder and especially aggravated kidnapping charges. TBI director Mark Gwyn previously said the agency has sworn statements from witnesses who claim to have seen Bobo alive with Autry and Adams after she had been reported missing. Gwynn added that they also had physical evidence being analyzed at two crime laboratories, and several witnesses. 'We believe other individuals have knowledge, and possibly others have involvement,' Mr Gwyn told News Channel 5. 'They can expect us to be on their doorsteps very soon.' He added: 'This is a case the TBI has been continuously working hard to solve now for three years. It has not been easy but I do know truth will prevail.' 'Anyone who had anything to do with Holly's disappearance will be brought to justice,' he added. The first major break in the case came in February, when the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation agents and FBI searched several areas around Decatur, including the home of Zachary Adams. Adams, was arrested and charged shortly afterwards. Adams appeared in court in April on charges of coercion of a witness after allegedly making threats to his brother who is due to testify against him. Adams' brother allegedly told the FBI he had seen Miss Bobo, 20, alive at his home after she was reported missing. Heartbroken: Holly's mom Karen Bobo is led into court by attorney Steve Farase in March, when Adams was charged with her murder and kidnap . Adams is accused of asking a fellow inmate to tell his brother: 'He's the one who started this s*** and if he don't shut his mouth he will be in the hole beside her,' CBS News reported. Autry, 39, has been indicted with especially aggravated kidnapping and first-degree felony murder. He is already in prison serving a three-year sentence for aggravated assault. The case about Miss Bobo's disappearance is still active. Prosecutors are considering seeking the death penalty if they get a conviction in the case.","Remains found by two people in Decatur County, Tennessee, on Sunday morning .

"Doctors probing the death of Dr David Kelly wrote to the Chief Coroner yesterday calling for his inquest to be resumed and the suicide verdict re-examined. In a letter to Judge Peter Thornton QC, they said there had been ‘deficiencies in legal processes’ that meant the government scientist’s inquest had never been formally closed, no final death certificate had been issued and no cause of death had been confirmed by a coroner. They also said the first police officer at the scene had changed his account of how the body was positioned, bolstering claims that it had been moved. Dr David Kelly in 2003 during the last interview he gave before committing suicide in Oxfordshire. Dr Kelly’s body was found near his Oxfordshire home in 2003 shortly after he was identified as the source of a BBC report about an official dossier on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. The doctors, led by radiologist Stephen Frost, have long campaigned for a full inquiry into how Dr Kelly died. They argue that the Hutton Inquiry, which effectively superseded the work of the Oxfordshire Coroner Nicholas Gardiner, was inadequate. They say Lord Hutton merely accepted the opinion of the pathologist without proper investigation and lacked the experience, qualification or legal authority to confirm the cause of death. They wrote: 'Any reasonable person would accept that the lack of adequate inquiry into the cause of death and the production of the new, uninvestigated evidence relating to the suicide conclusion provides overwhelming and exceptional reasons for this inquest to be resumed, the cause of death properly investigated, any new evidence admitted, the cause of death properly certified and the proceedings formally closed.' The letter said that Lord Hutton (left) did not investigate the death properly. Attorney general Dominic Grieve (right) rejected calls for an inquest in 2011 . In the letter, which has been copied to the Lord Chief Justice, the Lord Chancellor and the Oxfordshire coroner, they call for the inquest to be resumed with witnesses giving evidence under oath, in front of a jury. They said relevant members of Thames Valley police should be called to give evidence and all information made available to the Hutton Inquiry provided for consideration. The suicide verdict should be proved beyond all doubt, they said. The Hutton Inquiry found that Dr Kelly committed suicide in the woods near his house in Oxfordshire. The Attorney General Dominic Grieve rejected calls for an inquest in 2011 following a lengthy review of the case. Mr Grieve found there was no possibility that an inquest would reach a different conclusion from the Hutton Inquiry, which found in 2004 that Kelly committed suicide.","They have written to Judge Peter Thornton QC calling for further investigation .

Mr Kholodovskii (left) says his wife Yana Sotova (right) 'studies' pole dancing and has no problem with the leak . He also dismissed claims by some of the victims that showing their hacked pictures and videos amounts to a 'sex crime'. Among other stars whose personal photographs are featured without permission on the site are Scarlett Johansson,  Kate Upton, Kelly Brook and Jennifer Lawrence, who has branded the hacking of nude images as 'a sexual violation'. But drag racing driver Mr Kholodovskii said his 25 year old wife Yana Sotova - also a racer who is 'studying' pole dancing in her spare time - is untroubled by his job. 'Of course she knows about it. She thinks it is a normal job, it is just site hosting, this is it,' said Mr Kholodovskii, whose site has gained millions of hits and money from pop-up advertisements. Asked if she objected to the stolen content of the women, he said: 'No, no. I think it is because the world view has changed about it. All people think it's OK, at least all my friends think so. 'I would call it erotic with elements of porno. There are quite revealing pix there. Unrepentant: Mr Kholodovskii claims many stars leaked the images themselves to get 'good publicity' Drivers: The couple are both drag racing drivers and live in a southern Russian town where he runs the site . Not so high-octane: The programmer's town is most famous for producing the Soviet-era Lada car, pictured . Actresses and models were outraged after intimate photos of them emerged online at the end of August, when they were shared by users of the anonymous photo-sharing site 4chan. The images had been uploaded to iCloud, an online storage system available to all Apple users which synchronises with iPhones and iPads. It is thought many of the victims would have had their photos uploaded automatically without realising they had allowed the process to happen through their devices' security settings. Users' iCloud accounts are private, but hackers found a vulnerability in one of the site's login pages which allowed them to enter multiple passwords until they cracked users' details. Apple quickly fixed the glitch, but by then the damage had been done. Today it emerged 100,000 more videos and images have been leaked online after they were intercepted from Snapchat (above). The pictures are feared to contain a large cache of child pornography, as half of the app's users are aged between 13 and 17. Images sent using the app are designed to disappear after they have been viewed once, but recipients can take screenshots of the pictures and forward them to other people. 'Well, if you would like to know my opinion where these pictures are coming from, I think those celebrities release them themselves, for PR purposes. 'Because, I say it again: there are many celebrities nobody was aware of before, and now everyone is talking about them.' Asked to name stars who were happy about their intimate pictures being posted on the open internet or who may have released them voluntarily, he replied: 'I don't know the names, I am not quite interested who these people are, actresses or models.' He added: 'To tell the truth, this is just a job for me. I wish they were cars. I like cars more.' Porsche-driving Kholodovskii's role was first revealed in The Sun on Sunday. He was tracked down to his jewellery shop assistant mother Tatiana's home in the city of Togliatti, near Samara, the address he uses to register the sleazy site via an American company. He has now bought a new home in an elite tower block close to her £30,000 flat in a five-floor block on Lenin Boulevard built when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev ruled the Kremlin. The city is better known as the home of the indefatigable Soviet-era Lada car than for porn websites. 'I'm in charge of hosting and all technical matters to do with the running of this site,' he told the newspaper. 'This is my job. I am paid for it. The site is owned by my partner. He is a Russian man but he lives in Europe. 'I know him for a while but only via internet.' This mystery man 'is very bad with computers. He thinks he is more a businessman. I was offered a job and I said yes'. He claimed he 'never met' the owner. 'I do not know his real name and I do not care about it,"" he said. 'I am paid a fixed amount every month for maintenance of this website and I am satisfied with it. Anger: Celebrities who feature on the site include Kim Kardashian (left) and British model Kelly Brook (right) Victims: Singers Rihanna (left) and Rita Ora (right) were also targeted by the hackers in the iCloud leak . 'I am not paid much - but I have many websites.' A notice was recently posted on the site to say that that 'all the photos are freely available on the Internet. We don't hack iCloud, email and other accounts'. The site has also stated it will remove pictures of any celebrities objecting to their images being displayed. While insisting there is 'no illegal activity' behind the site, he admits on his own social networking site to have had long experience as a programmer. He posts an image of a book about hacking, and a code for the first programme he wrote a decade ago. He also posted images of erotica that he 'loves'. Speaking out: The actress Jennifer Lawrence said of the leak: 'It's disgusting. The law needs to be changed' Foreign websites pose a legal minefield for Western law enforcement agencies, and there is little prospect of Russian police acting against him. Even if they did, the Russian constitution bars extradition of its own citizens. Kelly Brook tweeted last week: 'My lawyer is dealing with 18 women who have all had their iCloud hacked.' She warned that 'some very young innocent women have been targeted - it's so wrong'. A furious Jennifer Lawrence added: 'It's disgusting. The law needs to be changed.'","Sergei Kholodovskii, 28, is technical brain behind Arizona-registered site .

"The Sky is the limit for Matthew Macklin and Irish boxing, according to promoter Eddie Hearn - all thanks to the ex-European champion’s vast potential. Macklin’s WBC world middleweight title eliminator against Argentina’s Jorge Sebastian Heiland was on Tuesday confirmed for Dublin’s 3 Arena on November 15, having been rescheduled from its original date last August. The Sky TV bill has an extra-polished sheen to it, too, as Hearn has added Irish Olympic medallist John Joe Nevin to the card, while the promoter hopes former European amateur champion Jason Quigley will also feature in his first home pro bout. Matthew Macklin (to the right of Eddie Hearn, centre) to fight Jorge Sebastian Heiland on November 15 . The August show had been postponed due to the shooting of Macklin’s trainer Jamie Moore in Marbella (now recovering from his injuries), and, despite having sold-out Dublin’s 2,000-capacity National Stadium in a matter of minutes, Macklin’s career was in danger of going off the rails and losing a much-needed momentum boost. But while domestic battles between rivals Gary ‘Spike’ O’Sullivan and Anthony Fitzgerald, and Ian Tims and Michael Sweeney, on the new undercard have Irish fight fans salivating, only Macklin had the pulling power to lure Sky TV back into the mix, according to Hearn, who has re-fixed the show for the 3 Arena, which will have a 6,000 capacity as his Matchroom promotional outfit dip their toe into the Irish market. ‘He’s the reason why we’re here,’ said Hearn of three-time world-title challenger Macklin. ‘No disrespect to Fitz, Spike and those guys, we couldn’t run a Sky date with those guys alone on the bill. They’re a brilliant support cast, they make the show, but you need the headline act, so if he loses, a lot hinges for Irish boxing on his performance and result.’ Jose Yebes (right) of Spain exchange punches with Macklin (left)  during the middleweight fight in Germany . The eagerness to please the broadcaster is down to the fact that TV networks remain the main paymasters behind big fight nights. Macklin, Birmingham-born with strong Tipperary roots, turned down Sky’s suggestion to stage the fight in the city of his birth, favouring a return to the Irish capital. ‘I’m proud to be bringing it back here, but, also, you feel that it’s not just my career riding on it. If I can go on and do well and bring more big nights back here, other [Irish] lads can benefit from it,’ he said. ‘It’s a good weight on my shoulders, not a heavy one.’ The WBC world middleweight title eliminator will be aired on Sky TV between Macklin and Heiland . Having struggled to shake off his ring rust in a keep-busy win over Spaniard Jose Yebes last month, Macklin is also keen to prove he still belongs at world level against 27-year-old Heiland. ‘This is the acid test. If I beat this guy and look really good doing it, I know that’s me on the way to becoming world champion,’ said Macklin. ‘If I perform like I know I can, I probably will knock him out.’","Matthew Macklin to fight Jorge Sebastian Heiland on November 15 .

"Diktat: The AA said 20mph zones should only be introduced where there was clear public support for the limit . Road safety campaigners and motoring groups are at loggerheads over moves for a blanket imposition of 20mph zones in residential areas. Campaigners urged the Government to make 20mph zones ‘the norm’ in urban areas and villages - insisting their widespread roll-out has reached a ‘tipping point’. But the AA said it was wrong to impose 20mph limits ‘by diktat’ and that the zones - which it broadly backs - should only be introduced where they carry clear public support. The row come as road safety group Brake today takes its ‘GO 20’ campaign to Parliament and calls on ministers and MPs to support the introduction of 20mph as the ‘default’ urban speed limit. Brake has released new figures suggesting nearly eight out of ten (78 per cent) of people think 20mph should be the ‘default’ limit around schools, in residential streets, villages, town and city centres. And just as many (81 per cent) think traffic travels too fast on local roads, according to the poll by Brake and Allianz Insurance. But the AA said it strongly opposed the idea of blanket imposition of 20mph zones without the consent and support of local residents. It supported lowering the limit from . 30mph to 20mph where local residents backed the idea - including outside . schools, colleges and hospitals. And . the AA’s own poll findings showed that nearly 7 out of ten (68 per . cent) were strongly in favour of local consultation before such lower . limits were brought in. Of that, some 31per cent were strongly in favour of consultation and 37per cent ‘somewhat’ in favour. By . contrast, only 1 in 20 (5 per cent) of those polled backed imposing . 20mph limits regardless of the feelings of local residents, said the AA. Brake has released new figures suggesting nearly eight out of ten (78 per cent) of people think 20mph should be the 'default' limit around schools, in residential streets, villages, town and city centres . AA president Edmund King said: ‘The message is loud and clear - residents want to be asked first before the speed limit is changed on their streets. It doesn’t mean they will say no to a 20mph speed limit, it means they want a say rather than being issued with a decree that ignores local democracy.’ The AA added: ‘We’d very concerned about it being imposed on arterial roads such as bus routes which could slow down the pace of a town or city.’ Brake said that areas where 20mph limits have been introduced have seen casualty rates fall, with Portsmouth recording a 22per cent dip in casualties and Camden in north London seeing crashes reduce by more than half (54 per cent). Other areas where 20mph limits have been imposed include the City of London, Birmingham, Newcastle upon Tyne and Edinburgh. Slow: It is estimated that 12.5 million people in the UK now living in areas which already have or are implementing 20mph limits . It argues that with an estimated 12.5 million people in the UK now living in areas which already have or are implementing 20mph limits, the UK is at a ‘tipping point’ at which it would make ‘social and economic sense’ to have 20mph limits as the ‘norm’ in residential areas. Brake deputy chief executive Julie Townsend said: ‘The GO 20 campaign is about defending everyone’s right to walk and cycle freely without being endangered, whether it’s to get to work, school, the shops, or just getting out and being active. ‘We need to tackle the senseless and violent casualties that continue to happen daily on our roads, and we need to enable people to live healthy, active, social lives. It’s clear that 20mph limits in communities can help bring this about - and it’s clear this is what people want.’ A Department for Transport spokesman said: ‘Setting speed limits on local roads is a matter for local authorities but this government has published new guidance to make it easier for councils to introduce 20mph zones. Research shows that cutting 20mph limits on certain roads can save lives and we must do all we can to prevent road casualties.’","Campaigners have urged Government to make 20mph limit 'the norm'

"The boxing gloves worn by Muhammad Ali when he claimed his first Heavyweight Championship title have emerged for sale for $500,000 (£300,000). The gloves were used by the boxing hero, then known as Cassius Clay, when he took to the ring against Sonny Liston Miami Beach, Florida, in February 1964. Liston was the most intimidating fighter at the time and the match was one of the most anticipated in the sport's history. 'Part of his first step to sports immortality': These boxing gloves which were used by Muhammad Ali in his first heavyweight title victory over Sonny Liston in 1964 . Up for grabs: The gloves were cut off Ali's wrists after the match by his trainer, Angelo Dundee, and they remained in his private collection until his death in February 2012 . Clay, weighing in at 210lbs and Liston at 218lbs, fought for seven rounds before the former heavyweight retired and Clay was declared the winner by technical knockout. The next day he changed his name to Cassius X but was called Muhammad Ali a week later for religious reasons. The gloves were cut off his wrists after the match by his trainer, Angelo Dundee, and they remained in his private collection until his death in February 2012. The leather accessories, that are in good condition but show signs of discolouration where the tape was, were then purchased by a private collector.

"At a towering 6ft 6in tall Anthony Joshua could be forgiven for having his head in the clouds. Reassuringly, Britain’s giant heavyweight hope has his feet planted more firmly on the ground than those already acclaiming him as the next Lennox Lewis or, even, the new Muhammad Ali. While those extravagant comparisons are being tossed in his direction with such premature carelessness, Joshua himself is keeping his progress from Olympic gold medallist to prospective world heavyweight champion in rational perspective. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Anthony Joshua reflects on first year as a professional boxer . Anthony Joshua crushed Denis Bakhtov on Saturday night to claim the WBC International belt . ‘The potential is there,’ he says, ’but it will take a lot more graft and grind to make the dream a reality.’ This Adonis has some wisdom to go with the muscle. As he turns 25 this week, Joshua knows that the journey takes a darn sight longer than the nine fights totalling 25 ring minutes which constitute the first year of his professional career. He is also aware that he will encounter along that road bigger, fitter, tougher and considerably more talented opponents than the portly old Kazakh he used as a punch bag at London’s O2 Arena on Saturday night. ‘Not everyone will fold like that under pressure,’ he says of Denis Bakhtov, whom he reduced to a bloody, albeit still standing, pulp inside two rounds. Joshua has spent just 25 minutes in the ring during his first nine professional fights . Whether, next time out in November, the 39-year-old Michael Sprott will muster sterner defiance is debatable. But strictly in the context of Joshua’s learning curve –‘I’m just starting phase two of my development’ – that fight should provide more useful experience. A truer litmus test could come from the fights which promoter Eddie Hearn is pondering for next year. Should the Watford Goliath take on and defeat the two Davids of British heavyweight boxing – Price and Haye – in the first half of 2015, the gateway to Wladimir Klitschko could swing open. Hearn has to weigh risk against reward, though. Joshua is still a comparative novice. So while it is natural for the public to be excited about him, it is not yet the time to get carried away. Former heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis has played down Joshua comparisons . Hard-hitting Joshua has been likened with boxing legend Muhammad Ali . Price is eager to collide with him as soon as possible, which is a warning of itself. As Price says: ‘I don’t think they’ll take the chance of putting him in with me just yet.’ And what’s the rush? The boxing fraternity are still trying to analyse the raw material which reinforces in the ring the affable nature of this most likeable contender. There are hints of Lewis in the more aggressive of his work. There is also a bit of the young Frank Bruno in his vulnerability to a counter-punch, which is one remnant of his amateur days. The hope is that young Joshua is very much in the process of becoming his own man. London’s Lewis, still the last undisputed heavyweight champion of the world, says of the comparison with himself: ‘He’s not the next Lennox, he’s the first Anthony Joshua.’ Now that is the shrewdest compliment of them all. Floyd Mayweather short of options . Floyd Mayweather displayed his considerable wealth on his Instagram account again . Floyd Mayweather continues to flaunt his money and to taunt Manny Pacquiao and Amir Khan. His problem is trying to find opponents for his two fights next year who are as credible as the the PacMan and the Bolton speed merchant, as his father acknowledges. Floyd Snr is risking the sack as his son’s trainer by admitting those two long-awaited blockbusters should happen. ‘I don’t know myself who I’ll fight next,’ says Mayweather as he sits in his Aladdin’s Cave in Las Vegas, up to his haunches in hundred dollar bills. Perhaps his biggest fight is with himself. Jimmy Tibbs takes tough path to redemption . Trainer Jimmy Tibbs with Michael Watson before his rematch with Chris Eubank in 1991 . The road to redemption is never easy but the path chosen by Jimmy Tibbs – from violent thug to esteemed boxing trainer via jail and born-again Christianity – has been especially rough. That journey from the gangland of London’s East End to the corner of the world championship ring is traced in blood, sweat, tears and anger through the 330 pages of his autobiography. It is a small miracle that, given the benefit of his rediscovery of Jesus Christ, his testament ends in hope and inspiration. The narrative is raw and. in principle. honest, even though there remains an element of denial about the validity of the 15 and ten-year prison sentences imposed on his father and himself, respectively, for their roles in the knife-wielding, gun-toting turf wars of the 60s - ‘We didn’t start it guv, we only took revenge.’ Witness to the respect in which a man of terrifying street violence has subsequently come to be held as a trainer is borne by the stable of fine fighters with whom he has worked – Charlie Magri, Michael Watson, Lloyd Honeyghan, Frank Bruno, Nigel Benn and now Billy Joe Saunders among them – and especially by the great Barry McGuigan providing the foreword to his life story . The strength of the book lies in the Damascan conversion of Tibbs to a more moral life and its body of evidence as to how the hardest game of all continues to offer salvation to those brave enough to climb from the gutter into the ring. *Jimmy Tibbs – Sparring With Life, SportMedia, paperback £9.99 .","Anthony Joshua crushed Denis Bakhtov to claim WBC International belt .

"There may yet be a presidential campaign in the future for former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin. Palin said in an interview with Fox Business Network today that she is invigorated rather than discouraged by her critics, and they make her 'want to get out there and defend the innocent, want to work so hard for justice in this country.' 'So, hey the more they're pouring on, the more I'm going to bug the crap out of them by being out there with a voice, with the message, hopefully running for office in the future, too,' Palin added. Don't put dirt on her grave just yet: Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin said today she hopes to run for office again . Palin built up goodwill among establishment Republicans when she joined Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts for a pancake breakfast last month at the Independence Historical Museum and Art Center. If Palin runs for president in 2016, she'll need the support of moderate Republicans like Roberts to win the GOP nomination . Palin decided not to seek the presidency in 2012 and she hasn't held elected office since she resigned as governor in 2009 during her first and only term. She remains a fixture of the Tea Party, however, and is generally billed as the keynote speaker at influential conservative conferences. In March Palin told Fox News that she did have a campaign apparatus set up for 2016, but 'I'll never say never.' If the GOP doesn't produce a candidate who is a 'fighter' and respects American exceptionalism, 'everything that makes America great, the promise of America then I would run,' Palin said. 'But I do think that there are so many Americans who feel like I feel, and they're capable. They're willing and able to serve. Public servants. They are willing and able to serve and to lead this country so it doesn't have to be me,' she said back then. In her interview today, Palin said Republican leaders 'need more guts' and have confidence in what the party stands for. She named Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah as 'good leaders' who don't back down. Cruz is a likely 2016 presidential candidate but he has not formally announced his intentions to form a presidential exploratory committee. Given that neither Cruz, nor any other presumed GOP candidates have announced yet, Palin still has time to decide if she wants to join the 2016 rodeo, as well. If she were to run she would surely have the backing Tea Partiers and hard right conservatives. She's also built up some good will among establishment types by campaigning for embattled Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts last month. If Roberts, who is disliked by many conservatives, loses his reelection bid, Republicans may not take over the Senate.","Palin said in an interview today that she is invigorated rather than discouraged by her critics .

"Researchers have developed a breakthrough technique that enables them to build 'invisible' materials out of light. The method uses light like a needle to thread long chains of particles. And, the scientists claim, it could be an important step towards building invisibility cloaks. Scientists at the University of Cambridge have developed an 'invisible' metamaterial. They say their technique can be scaled up to cloak large objects. This image depicts an efficient route to manufacturing nanomaterials with light through plasmon-induced laser-threading of gold nanoparticle strings . The research, published in the journal Nature Communications, describes how engineering materials at a nanoscale level can induce invisibility. Materials just a few billionths of a metre across can be built to alter the way in which light passes through them. Known as a ‘metamaterial’, these can be designed to reflect light in the ‘wrong’ way. A metamaterial is an artificial material that has been engineered to have properties different to those found naturally in nature. According to the Institute of Physics, metamaterials can bend electromagnetic radiation such as light around an object to give the appearance that it isn’t there. To date some researchers have used such properties of metamaterials to create devices that can bend certain forms of radiation such as near-infrared radiation. So far, however, producing the same effect with visible light has proved more of a challenge. This technique involves stitching gold nanoparticles together in long strings, which is achieved by using unfocused laser light as a ‘needle’. These strings are then stacked in layers on top of one another, allowing materials to be made in high quantities. When light is shone upon an object it is either reflected or absorbed, dictating how it appears to a human eye. This means that by using such metamaterials, the interaction of particles with light can be changed so that the object appears invisible, or as something completely different. While the effect has been known of for some time, scaling it up to a useful size had proved problematic. But the University of Cambridge researchers have proposed this novel solution that they say makes it possible. A metamaterial can be engineered to alter its interaction with light and make it reflect the 'wrong' way, making a material appear different or invisible. Although something like the stock image shown is probably a little way off, the researchers say it is still an important step in the right direction . The strings of particles are connected using barrel-shaped molecules known as cucurbiturils (CBs), which can be used to control the spacing between nanoparticles and lock them in place. Cucurbiturils are like molecular handcuffs - molecules which can be used to hold other molecules together. In this research, Cucurbiturils were used like tile spacers, so that all of the gold nanoparticles could be held at a uniform distance before connecting them to make the finished material. Using ultrafast lasers, these so-called ‘bridges’ can then be made to form and hold the nanoparticles together in long strings. 'It’s about finding a way to control that bridge between the nanoparticles,' said Dr Ventsislav Valev of the University’s Cavendish Laboratory, one of the authors of the paper. 'Joining a few nanoparticles together is fine, but scaling that up is challenging. 'We have controlled the dimensions in a way that hasn’t been possible before. 'This level of control opens up a wide range of potential practical applications.'","Scientists at the University of Cambridge develop 'invisible' metamaterial .

"A neighborhood watch captain with an extensive criminal history has been named the primary suspect in at least one of 10 rapes committed in a Dallas neighborhood since June – and he’s now on the run. Van Dralen Dixson, 38, of Dallas, was accused of at least one of the rapes after his DNA sample matched that of the attacker, police have yet to name him to eight other attacks they say were committed by a serial rapist, but are testing his DNA against that of the attacker. An additional attack Saturday morning has yet to be linked to the other nine, but the investigation is ongoing. All 10 attacks have happened in and around the Fair Park neighborhood of South Dallas, an area rife with crime and homelessness. They took place during roughly the same hours Mr Dixson is said to have patrolled the area, armed and in a car matching one described by all the victims. The neighborhood watch association was unaware of his prior criminal history. On the run: Van Dralen Dixson, 38, fled after authorities took a sample of his DNA while investigating a rape - he matched the attacker and is now off the grid . Mr Dixson disappeared shortly after providing investigators with a DNA sample, dropping his children with a relative and ditching his car nearby, officials said. Victims have all described a car similar to the 2003 Saturn owned by the suspect, according to officials. ‘The results provided a positive DNA match for a suspect,’ Dallas police spokesperson Jeff Cotner said during a weekend news conference. ‘Officers are working diligently to locate the suspect.’ Though not linked to the other attacks, authorities are now awaiting test results from specimens collected in the other attacks. ‘We are still awaiting laboratory results on the evidence submitted for testing from other cases,’ said Mr Cotner. A wanted man: Dallas Police announced Dixson as the main suspect in at least one of 10 rapes committed in Dallas' Fair Park neighborhood during a weekend news conference . In addition to announcing that a warrant has been issued for his arrest on one charge of aggravated sexual assault, Mr Cotner said there is also a $15,000 reward for information leading to Mr Dixson’s capture. Once captured, he will be subject to a $1million bond, Mr Cotner added. As a neighborhood watch captain with the Mill City Community Association, Mr Dixson was responsible only to inform residents of upcoming meetings, but often patrolled the area after dark, while armed, locals told the Dallas Morning News. ‘His responsibility was to go around and make people aware of the association,’ association president Alendra Lyons told the paper. All attacks occurred between midnight and 6am, the paper noted. Kym Montgomery, the youth pastor at Mr Dixson's church, was planning to confront the missing man about a comment his six-year-old daughter made while at church complaining she was 'tired of being the baby sitter,' she told the Morning News, noting that the girl had explained she was often left home along with her three siblings. 'I was going to ask him about it, but I . didn’t get to,’ Montgomery told the paper, ‘and now the puzzle is coming . together because he was gone and she was up. She had to baby-sit.’ Run-down: Locals described the neighborhood as run-down and prone to crime . Neighbors were in disbelief over the accusations. One neighbor told CBS DFW that Mr Dixson was a ‘quiet guy that kind of kept to himself’ and often walked the streets. Another told the station that she ‘wouldn’t have thought it was him’ after saying that she ‘felt like whoever it was, it was somebody that was familiar with the neighbourhood.’ Described at a good father and a religious man by one relative, a youth pastor at Mr Dixson’s church painted a very different picture of the accused rapist. Montgomery described Mr Dixson to the Morning News as an angry man who made paranoid accusations against the family of his ex-wife. The minister noticed Mr Dixson’s car parked across the street from the church, an unusual occurrence. ‘I thought it was strange,’ Montgomery told the paper. ‘Nobody parks across the street. It’s a small church, and we all park there together.’ Vulnerable: Locals also told Dallas media that the attacker is likely taking advantage of the large homeless population, with homeless women particularly vulnerable to such attacks because they have no where to hide . Dixson is well-known to local law enforcement, having been arrested as recently as last month for deadly conduct after pointing a gun at someone four weeks ago, according to NBC DFW. He provided officials with an address he hasn’t lived at for two years when taken into custody, according to the station. ‘He is still getting mail here, from lawyers, my girlfriend was sending it back,’ the home’s current resident said. Explaining that he's met Mr Dixson, the man then expressed his disbelief before adding 'you never know.' High crime: The Fair Park area is also prone to robberies, assaults and car thefts, according to SpotCrime . Criminal activity is rampant in the neighborhood surrounding Fair Park, site of the Texas State Fair set to begin later this month, according to SpotCrime. There is a high incidence of robbery, assault and theft, in addition to this summer's 10 sexual assaults. A crime rate heat map from Trulia covers the majority of the neighborhood in various shades of red - indicating high incidences of crime. Locals interviewed by Dallas media suspected Mr Dixson was taking advantage of the run-down area's high population of homeless, attacking women that are vulnerable because they have nowhere to hide. Mr Dixson’s lengthy arrest history includes convictions for aggravated robbery, evading arrest and resisting arrest, according to authorities. The accused rapist was also arrested in 1992 for aggravated sexual assault and making a terroristic threat, but those charges were dropped, officials said.","Van Dralen Dixson was named the primary suspect in at least one of nine sexual assaults after his DNA was matched the attacker's .
It has since emerged that Mr Dixson was appointed captain of neighborhood watch despite having an extensive criminal history .
The missing man has an extensive criminal history and has been described as an angry, erratic man by a youth pastor in his church .
His daughter told that pastor she was 'tired of being the babysitter' to her three siblings .
ALL of the attacks happened between midnight and 6am, the same times Dixson was known to patrol the area ."

"Former President George W. Bush has said there is a 50-50 chance his brother Jeb will try to run for president. Brother Jeb, a former Florida governor, is 'wrestling with the decision' of running for the Republican nomination for president in 2016, George W. Bush says. However he insisted he would be 'all in' for his brother if he decides to run for the office and would do whatever he asks, even if it's to stay behind the scenes. Family ties: Former President George W. Bush has said there is a 50-50 chance his brother Jeb (pictured together during a campaign rally in Niceville, Florida, will try to run for president . 'I think it's 50-50,' the former president told CBS' 'Face the Nation.' 'He and I are very close. On the other hand, he's not here knocking on my door, you know, agonizing about the decision. He knows exactly, you know, the ramifications on family, for example. He's seen his dad and his brother go through the presidency. I'd give it a tossup.' The former president was more conservative in his estimate than another family member. Jeb Bush's son George P. Bush said two weeks ago it was more likely than not that the former Florida governor would move forward. George W. Bush is promoting '41,' a book about his father, former President George H.W. Bush. 'One of the lessons you learn from George H.W. Bush is that you can go into politics and still be a good father,' George W. Bush said when asked if it's worth putting a family through a presidential campaign. 'I put our family through it,' he responded. As for their mother's position that enough Bushes have run for president, he said, 'Sometimes her prognostications haven't been very accurate.' The younger Bush preceded Barack Obama in America's highest office, and saw his Pentagon's hard-fought gains in the region reversed by troop pullouts from both Afghanistan and Iraq. Support: George W. Bush said he would be 'all in' for his brother if he decides to run for the office and would do whatever he asks, even if it's to stay behind the scenes . During the interview he also said that he has no regrets about sending American servicemen and women to the Middle East for the conflict. GOP operatives and donors have reported that Bush is beginning to signal stronger interest in a presidential run, although some suggest he needs to act relatively quickly. 'If he waits too long he'll start to lose his advantages, the built-in network,' Republican strategist and former Minnesota Rep. Vin Weber said. 'Those people are not going to wait forever.' Twice over the last six years Florida voted for U.S. President Barack Obama, and political observers warned against reading too much into the Republican Party's win on Tuesday when looking ahead to the 2016 presidential elections.

"President Barack Obama will discuss the situation in Ferguson, Missouri, Monday with his Cabinet, civil rights leaders, law enforcement officials and others. The White House says Obama's Cabinet meeting will focus on his administration's review of federal programs that provide military-style equipment to law enforcement agencies. The president will also meet with young civil rights leaders to discuss the challenges posed by 'mistrust between law enforcement and communities of color.' Scroll down for video . Meeting: President Obama will meet with his Cabinet and young civil rights leaders to discuss Ferguson . Unrest shows no sign of dying down in the Missouri city where today Bishop Derrick Robinson was arrested . He'll then meet with government and law enforcement officials, as well as other community leaders, to discuss how to strengthen neighborhoods. Protests have continued in Ferguson, but have been more muted than the violence sparked last week by a grand jury's decision not to indict a police officer in the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown. It was announced Saturday that, despite the decision not to try him for any crime, Wilson had nonetheless resigned his commission with the police department. The officer said he had given up on law enforcement so that the community could 'heal' after his actions ultimately caused national outcry and night of looting and fires. Nonetheless, a seven-day march is currently underway from Ferguson to Missouri's capital Jefferson City and Governor Jay Nixon's mansion to call for a change in police leadership. Crisis: Arrests have been daily as protesters in St Louis (pictured) and elsewhere storm the streets . Conflict: The President will address the contentious militarization of Ferguson's police force with federal funds . There have been riots, looting and buildings burned in Ferguson since Monday’s grand jury verdict. At least 16 protesters were arrested late Friday outside the Ferguson police department and after demonstrators shut down a shopping mall in St Louis, demanding a boycott of post-Thanksgiving shopping. And on Sunday, five St. Louis Rams players stood with their arms raised in a show of solidarity for Ferguson protesters before trotting onto the field for pregame introductions at the Edward Jones Dome. A Rams spokesman said on Sunday that the team was not aware the gesture had been planned before the game against the Oakland Raiders. Televised protest: Five St Louis Rams players emerged on to the field with their hands in the air in protest . Wide receivers Tavon Austin and Kenny Britt came out together first, with the move obscured by a smoke machine in the upper reaches of the stadium.

After Tre Mason scored on an 8-yard run to make it 45-0 in the fourth quarter, the gesture made another appearance when he and Britt raised their hands together.","President Obama will meet with Cabinet and young civil rights leaders .

He proclaims his hatred for ‘race-mixing, aka having sex with anyone that is not white, European or caucasian’ as well as domesticated animals, humans or pets, shopping in malls, burning candles, gadgets, most technology and computers and ‘texting like robots because robots text and humans do not’. Launching a tirade on religion Mr Rays adds: ‘They are sh*t and all control mechanisms to keep people slaves and spiritually dead in this spiritually dead, satanic, trauma based, mind control, death cult that is called the USA.’ Ithaca Police Department and the Tompkins County Sheriff’s Department said they have received multiple complaints about the man. He is described as being around 6ft, white with short, brown hair. He was seen driving a late 90’s vehicle described as being either a green Chevrolet Lumina or a Monte Carlo. A message on Tompkins County Sheriff Office’s Facebook page states: ‘On September 30, the Sheriff’s Department received a call regarding a suspicious person handing out fliers in Newfield. 'Additionally, the Ithaca Police Department has also received complaints on this individual.’ In a further rant on his website, Mr Rays, goes on to describe his cult as an ‘elitest organisation, but unlike all other elitest organisations on earth we are not soul-less’. He says: ‘We are different and something new, because ALL the other elitest organisations on earth are elitest just like us, but they are soul-less. We are soul-ful. ‘That’s how NSC differs from every other elitest organisation on earth. If you are hardcore elitest to the bone, but have soul, join us.’","Hitler-loving Stevie Rays calls himself a 'full blown dictator'

"Manchester United and Arsenal have been told they can sign Cesc Fabregas if they are willing to offer £45million. United failed in a similar bid last year with the 27-year-old Barcelona midfielder keen to stay at the Camp Nou. Back again: United failed in a similar bid for the Cesc Fabregas last summer, but could return again . His position remains the same but the club expect a summer of change and his prospective sale plus that of Alexis Sanchez could represent the best way of generating income for the pending changes. Javier Mascherano, Daniel Alves, Pedro and Cristian Tello will also be sold if the right offers arrive. Meanwhile, United midfielder Shinji Kagawa is unlikely to leave Old Trafford in the summer, his agent has said. Speaking before the DFB Pokal final between Dortmund and Bayern Munich on Saturday, Thomas Kroth told kicker that Kagawa, 25, had no immediate plans to move on. Kroth said: 'Shinji will play the World Cup now and then see what the new Manchester United manager's plans are. Right now, it is rather unlikely that he will leave the club in the summer.' Staying put: Shinji Kagawa is unlikely to leave Old Trafford in the summer, his agent has said . Southampton have added Swansea left-back Neil Taylor to their list of potential replacements for Luke Shaw. Taylor, 25, wants regular first team football after making just 19 appreances this season due to injury and the form of Ben Davies. He was the subject of a £4million bid from Fulham in January but Swansea kept hold of the Wales international. Asked about his future, Taylor said: 'I'm going to have a holiday with my family and think about it over the summer. But I'm contracted to the club and that's as far as my thinking goes. 'I can't say whether I expect to be here or not - players don't know as much as you think. I can't tell you what's going to happen because I don't know. 'A lot of players say I want out, I want this or that, but I'm contracted to a football club: they pay your wages and I'll do what's asked of me. And this is a club that's been good to me down the years so it's important you do the best you can, whatever the situation. They pay my wages and fans travel I don't know how many miles to watch us.' Replacement: Swansea's Neil Taylor could fill in for Luke Shaw at Southampton . There could be plenty of changes at Swansea this summer with Ashley Williams considering his future, goalkeeper Michel Vorm wanted by Liverpool and striker Wilfried Bony on the list of potential targets for Liverpool and Arsenal. Southampton will lose Shaw to Manchester United and have already considered Nice left-back Timothee Kolodziejczak, as revealed in Sportsmail, but he will be more expensive at around £7million. Taylor may be allowed to go for £5m with add-ons. Eden Hazard remains on Paris St Germain's wishlist this summer. The uneasy truce struck between the Belgian and coach Jose Mourinho has given the French champions a belief they can prise him away from Stamford Bridge and maintain an interest in his teammate David Luiz. Despite being rapped on the knuckles for their overspending by UEFA, albeit not as harshly as Manchester City, PSG are making plans to offload Ezequiel Lavezzi, Javier Pastore and Marco Verratti to balance the books while Edinson Cavani is keen to leave too. PSG's alternatives to Hazard include Pedro at Barcelona and Angel di Maria at Real Madrid. Hot property: Chelsea's Eden Hazard remains on Paris St Germain's wishlist this summer . Malaga's hopes of a cut-price deal for Leeds United striker Ross McCormack have been dashed after the crisis-torn Championship club set an £8million price tag on their top scorer. The Spanish side have a genuine interest in the Scotland international but were hoping to strike a bargain as Leeds continue to cut their costs ahead of facing winding-up orders and having their main bank account frozen. Owner Massimo Cellino is in talks to sell his other club Cagliari to Inter Milan director Tommaso Giulini for a reported £40m this week insisting he intends to save Leeds. The chaos at Elland Road has brought plenty of twists and turns for staff and fans. Goalkeeper Jamie Ashdown learned on Twitter that he had been released before receiving his formal letter on Saturday that confirmed he would not be getting a new contract. Stay or go? Ross McCormack (front) has an £8million price tag on his head, set by Leeds . SEM agency advisor Dave Sheron has been toasting a successful end of season. Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes, who has revived his career since leaving Bristol City, won Scotland's manager of the year and their football writers' award while Crystal Palace's miracle man Tony Pulis won the LMA's award for Premier League manager of the year. Sheron is an advisor to both McInnes and Pulis and is also helping former Liverpool defender Sami Hyypia. The genial Hyypia is still such a popular figure at Anfield that fans started trending #ohsamisami on Monday in tribute to the fact that he signed for Liverpool 15 years ago from Willem II. However, it is his managerial career that Sheron is helping Hyypia to shape. The 40-year-old Finn was sacked by Bayer Leverkusen despite guiding them towards a Champions League qualification position and is now looking at opportunities in England. West Bromwich Albion, Norwich and Brighton have all taken note of Hyypia's availability and the contacts he can bring. England return? Former Leverkusen boss Sami Hyypia has sparked interest from West Brom, Norwich and Brighton . Arsenal look to have secured teenager Chris Willock after extensive contract talks. The 16-year-old midfielder was wanted by Manchester United who have his older brother Matty on their books. However, Arsenal are understood to have offered a lucrative deal to ensure the England U16 international stays at The Emirates where he has already taken part in training with the first team. Willock is now due to sign his first professional deal. His younger brother Joe, 13, is also an exciting prospect emerging at Arsenal.","Barcelona midfielder could leave the Nou Camp with the club needing to generate income for pending changes .

"Mitt Romney's world tour took another embarrassing turn on Tuesday when a top aide told reporters at a Polish holy site to 'kiss my a**' and 'shove it' when they shouted questions at the Republican presidential candidate. Rick Gorka, Romney's traveling press secretary, flew off the handle at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Warsaw and was forced to apologize -- marking the third-straight country where sideshow remarks have distracted from intent of the resume-boosting international trip. In London last week, Romney was jeered by politicians and booed by crowds after he suggested the city wasn't ready to for the Olympic Games. Scroll down for video . Paying respect: Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney visited the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Warsaw, Poland, on Tuesday in the final leg of his world tour . Lashing out: Press secretary Rick Gorka was forced to apologize after telling reporters to 'kiss my a**' He drew criticism and accusations of racism in Jerusalem on Monday when he said Israel's economic superiority to the Palestinian territories was a matter of 'culture.' His campaign has vehemently denied those allegations. Mr Gorka's remarks came hours before a major foreign policy speech in the Polish capital in which Romney praised the central European nation for becoming what he said was a model of small government and free enterprise. The former Massachusetts governor . said that 'rather than heeding the false promise of a . government-dominated economy, Poland sought to stimulate innovation, . attract investment, expand trade and live within its means' after the . Communist era. 'The world should pay close attention to the transformation of Poland’s economy,' Romney said. 'A march toward economic liberty and smaller government has meant a march toward higher living standards, a strong military that defends liberty at home and abroad, and an important and growing role on the international stage.' Mr Gorka's angry words to reporters were made Tuesday morning when Romney visited a monument to Poland's war dead with the Warsaw mayor. Reporters began shouting questions at the presumptive Republican nominee from behind a rope line because, they said, he has answered only three queries from the traveling press corps. A CNN reporter shouted: 'Gov Romney are you concerned about some of the mishaps of your trip?' 'Gov Romney do you have a statement for the Palestinians?' a New York Times reporter asked'What about your gaffes?' chimed in a Washington Post writer. 'Governor Romney do you feel that your gaffes have overshadowed your foreign trip?' asked the Times journalist. Honoring the dead: Romney laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Solider before visiting with the mayor of Warsaw . Praise: Romney said Poland was a model for small government and free enterprise during a foreign policy speech at the University of Warsaw Library . 'Governor Romney just a few . questions sir, you haven't taken but three questions on this trip from . the press!' the CNN reporter protested. That's when Mr Gorka stepped in: 'Show some respect,' he told the American journalists. When a New York Times reporter said he was trying to get answers to his question, Gorka responded harshly. 'Kiss my a**. This is a Holy site for the Polish people. Show some respect,' he said. Going home: The foreign policy speech was on the last events of Romney's world tour. He returns home on Wednesday . Later, he told a Politico reporter to 'shove it.' About 30 minutes later, the spokesman called reporters and apologized. However, it's likely that for all the media bluster, Romney's 'gaffes' on his foreign trip will effectively zero impact on his chances in the November election. A poll in May found that only one percent of voters said foreign policy was the most important issue in the race. The foreign trip also garnered front page coverage in several newspapers in the swing states of Florida, Nevada and Ohio -- with on-message stories about his support for Israel, not articles about his slip-ups.","Latest distraction comes on final leg of international trip to London, Israel and Poland .
