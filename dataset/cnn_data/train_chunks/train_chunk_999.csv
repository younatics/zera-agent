"Boxing superstar Floyd Mayweather Jr. has accused the NFL of overreacting to the video of former Baltimore Ravens star Ray Rice knocking out his then-fiancee in an Atlantic City casino elevator which emerged on Monday. In the light of the shocking video, Rice was fired by the Ravens and suspended indefinitely by the NFL, but according to Mayweather the organization had got it right when it originally handed the NFL star just a two-game suspension during the summer. 'I think there's a lot worse things that go on in other people's households, also,' Mayweather told reporters at the MGM Grand hotel in Las Vegas on Tuesday. 'It's just not caught on video, if that's safe to say.' Scroll down for video . Boxing superstar Floyd Mayweather Jr. has accused the NFL of overreacting to the video of former Baltimore Ravens star Ray Rice knocking out his then-fiancee  which emerged on Monday . The undefeated five-division world champion has had his own domestic abuse issues and currently faces a trial by jury after his ex-fiancee filed an explosive civil lawsuit last week. Shantel Jackson claims the fighter subjected her to years of torment through physical and emotional abuse including preventing her from leaving his Las Vegas mansion. In 2012 the boxer spent two months in a Las Vegas jail for a domestic violence attack in which he twisted ex-girlfriend Josie Harris's arm in front of two of their young children. Mayweather still maintains his innocence even after pleading to reduced domestic abuse charges in the 2012 case. Had he not taken the plea bargain, the boxer would have gone to trial on felony charges that could have gotten him up to 34 years in prison. On Tuesday Mayweather said he has been falsely accused many times. Ray Rice was fired by the Baltimore Ravens on Monday and a day later his wife Janay Rice released a statement supporting her husband and criticizing the media for drawing attention to the incident in February . Explosive video footage released on Monday showed Ray Rice punch his then fiancee unconscious and led to him being indefinitely suspended from the NFL . 'Like I've said in the past, no bumps, no bruises, no nothing,' he said. 'With O.J. and Nicole, you seen pictures. With Chris Brown and Rihanna, you seen pictures. With (Chad) Ochocinco and Evelyn, you seen pictures. 'You guys have yet to see any pictures of a battered woman, a woman who says she was kicked and beaten (by Mayweather). So I just live my life and try to stay positive, and try to become a better person each and every day.' Both the NFL and the Ravens broke their silence on Tuesday about their respective decisions to punish Rice more harshly in the wake of Monday’s video. Commissioner Roger Goodell told CBS that ‘no one in the NFL, to my knowledge’ had seen a new video of what happened on the elevator until it was posted online. ‘We assumed that there was a video. We asked for video. But we were never granted that opportunity,’ Goodell said. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, left, and Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti, right, broke their silence on Tuesday about their respective decisions to punish Rice more harshly in the wake of Monday's video . In a letter to fans, Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti said the team should have done more to get the video as the investigation continued, and it was a ‘mistake’ not to. He said the team tried to get the video from both the casino and law enforcement, but the casino wouldn't share it and that authorities refused. It is common for law enforcement to decline to release evidence when an investigation is ongoing. ‘We should have seen it earlier. We should have pursued our own investigation more vigorously,’ the letter said. ‘We didn't and we were wrong.’ According to court papers seen by Mail Online, Floyd Mayweather is accused of battering, blackmailing, imprisoning and stealing from his former lover Shantel Jackson. The 29-year-old model announced she was suing Mayweather last week, claiming at a press conference that he beat her and invaded her privacy by posting a picture of an ultrasound scan online and announcing that they broke up because she aborted their twin babies. But in sensational court documents the full extent of the boxer's tumultuous on-off eight year relationship with the beauty is laid bare in painful detail. Shantel Jackson, right, ex-fiancee of boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr., breaks down as she reads a statement with her attorney Gloria Allred looking on after announcing a lawsuit against the boxer for battery, assault, invasion of privacy, defamation and false imprisonment . Shantel says she suffered years of hell at the hands of Mayweather, 37, whose ‘outrageous acts’ caused her ‘pain and humiliation’. During one argument, he allegedly choked and twisted her arm, while in another he held her at gun point and threatened to shoot her. He also kept her ‘prisoner’ in his Las Vegas home, threatened to publish naked pictures he had secretly taken of her while she slept and stole thousands of dollars worth of belongings from her, her court filings claim. And in raging verbal attacks he called her a ‘bum’ and a ‘b*tch’ telling her, ‘You're not sh*t without me. I made you who you are.’ Shantel is seeking unspecified damages from Mayweather for battery, assault, defamation, invasion of privacy, false imprisonment, harassment and infliction of emotional distress. The case is due to be tried by jury in Los Angeles and is expected to last seven days, court papers show. Shantel says she suffered years of hell at the hands of Mayweather, 37, whose ‘outrageous acts’ caused her 'pain and humiliation' Stunning Shantel met the boxer in 2006 when she was aged 21 and working as a hostess at an event in Atlanta, Georgia. The pair began dating and soon after Mayweather asked her to move in with him in Las Vegas. The boxer, who was last year named the highest paid athlete of the year by Forbes, showered her with gifts including a 17 carat diamond worth $2,500,000, over 100 designer handbags and masses of designer clothing . He also lavished her with ‘substantial cash gifts’ and allowed her to use his credit card. However, Mayweather soon became very controlling and Shantel had to ‘make herself available to him virtually at all times’ and was not allowed to work, according to the lawsuit filed on Thursday at the Superior Court of California. Shantel, who changed her last name to ‘Jackson-Mayweather’ at the boxing champ's request, stood by her man when he was jailed in 2012 for a domestic violence attack in which he twisted ex-girlfriend Josie Harris's arm in front of two of their young children. Court papers state that during a jealous rage, Mayweather twisted Shantel's arm, then 'choked her and forcibly took her phone away from her to look through it.'  Just a week later he begged for forgiveness and promised 'he would never assault her again' the documents continue . But just days after his release from prison, Mayweather allegedly lashed out at her in almost the same way as he had attacked his ex. The court papers state that during a jealous rage, the undefeated boxer twisted Shantel's arm, then ‘choked her and forcibly took her phone away from her to look through it.’ Just a week later Mayweather begged for forgiveness and promised ‘he would never assault her again’ the documents continue. Mayweather made his controversial remarks regarding Ray Rice before a small group of reporters at the MGM Grand hotel, where he made a formal fight week arrival for his rematch on Saturday with Argentina's Marcos Maidana. Mayweather won a majority decision over Maidana in May but was roughed up at times in perhaps the toughest of his recent string of fights. The unbeaten 37-year-old also said he plans to fight just twice more after Maidana, finishing his career next September. He didn't specifically dismiss Manny Pacquiao as an opponent for one of those bouts - as he has repeatedly done in the past - though he said reports there had been talks on a possible fight were completely false.","Boxing champ has accused the NFL of overreacting to video of former Ravens star Ray Rice knocking his then-fiancee unconscious .

"Scroll down for video . The ex-wife of suspected killer Ron Lee Haskell – who fled her abusive and violent husband after 11 years of marriage - believes she has paid the ‘ultimate price for freedom’, her former divorce lawyer told MailOnline. Al Barker, the lawyer who represented Melanie Lyon in her divorce from Haskell, revealed she made the heart-breaking statement to family members after discovering her ex had slaughtered six of her relatives in cold blood. Melanie's sister Katie Stay, brother-in-law Stephen and four of their young children were gunned down at their Texas home on Wednesday. Melanie Lyon Haskell, pictured here with then-husband Ronald and the couple's three children is in 'shock' over the massacre. Al Barker, her former lawyer who became good friends with her, said: 'I just hope other victims (of domestic violence) don¿t look at her case and think,""this could happen to me""' Mr Barker, who works for Utah Legal Services, revealed that Melanie is still in ‘shock’ over the massacre as she tried to come to terms with the reasons behind it. Mr Barker tried to reach out to Melanie on Thursday but instead spoke to her mother Kelly Lyon. ‘It was a really brief conversation, I was trying to call Melanie to express my condolences, but her mom answered,’ said Mr Barker. ‘I asked her how Melanie was doing and she told me that Melanie was in shock over what happened.’ But for Mr Barker – who grew to know Melanie well during the seven month divorce – what she said next was hard to take. He said: ‘Melanie’s mother told me something that her daughter had said after the incident. ‘She said that she had to pay the ultimate price for freedom. ‘That sounds like something Melanie would have said, knowing her, it’s something that would have come out of her mouth. ‘But I felt terrible because it is not her fault'. Accused mass shooter Ronald Lee Haskell is escorted by deputies for a hearing in Houston, Texas July 11, 2014 . Haskell is accused of killing four children aged 4 to 14 and their parents in the Houston suburb of Spring . History: On the left is Ron Lee Haskell's . mugshot taken following his arrest, while on the . right is an undated mugshot taken from one of many run-ins with Utah authorities over the past six-years for domestic abuse .

Emily, nine, Zachary, four and Bryan, 14 . Today new details of the bitter split between Melanie and husband Haskell have emerged. Neighbors at their old family home in Logan, Utah say the couple had been building a house in nearby Smithfield, but Melanie tried to escape her abusive marriage before it was completed. Haskell pleaded guilty to simple assault in a domestic violence-related incident in 2008, according to Utah state court records. ‘Melanie Haskell stated her husband Ronald had (dragged) her by her hair and struck her in the head, and then did it again in front of the children,"" according to Logan police. The abuse allegedly continued after that court case ended. 'She was tired of him beating her up and her children witnessing it. And when she saw her oldest child start to become violent, she chose to move into a (Community Abuse Prevention Service Agency) home for their safety,' neighbor Jolyn Young told local Utah paper the Deseret News. 'I was heartbroken, just sick and devastated,' she said. While in the process of building their homes, Young said Melanie confided in her that she had left her husband. According to Deseret News she and her children had reportedly gone to live in a secure location for their safety, following years of abuse. Arrested: The Harris County Precinct 4 . Constable's Office says 33-year-old Ron Lee Haskell, shot seven family . members, including two adults and five children on Wednesday night in . Houston, Texas . Arrest: Law enforcement officers surround Ron . Haskell on Wednesday, July 9, 2014, in Spring, Texas. After hours of . waiting and negotiations, the suspect emerged from his car, raised his . hands and sank to his knees . Like many victims of abuse, Melanie told Young that she always thought things would improve, but when she saw one of her children exhibit violent behavior similar to her husband, that was her breaking point. Shockingly, Young said Melanie wanted to buy new pots and pans for her home — because the set she had reminded her of the times Haskell allegedly struck her with them. Mr Barker says he’s now anxious to reach out to Melanie to offer her words of support. ‘She needs space right now but I don’t want her to feel like this is her own fault, she did everything right. She was going through a difficult relationship, she knew it was harmful for her and her family. ‘She did all the right things to get out. I just hope that other victims don’t look at her case and think, “this could happen to me”. ‘Most of the time in a domestic violence situation the victim ends up dying a slow emotional death, being fearful, being manipulated and being controlled and doing everything you can do get out of that relationship is best for the individual so they can make a better life for themselves and their children. ‘Melanie did all the right things, this is just a terrible tragedy.' Mr Barker said he only saw Haskell on a few occasions during the divorce, but each time he was ‘silent, and he was calm and he was collected’. But the attorney doesn't believe that was the case behind closed doors. ‘We had some serious concerns about his stability,’ Mr Barker said. ‘I think Melanie knew she needed to get out of this relationship.’ Scene unfolding: This was the scene last night in Houston after . 34-year-old Ron Lee Haskell reportedly opened fire on members of his family in Houston . Stand off: The suspect, a male, was in his car during a stand off with police .

Tragedy: A Harris County Medical Examiner places . one of the six bodies found in a house after several people were shot . to death, into the coroner's van in the Houston suburb of Spring, in . Texas early July 10, 2014 . Mr Barker said he spoke to Melanie not long after she left Utah to be close to family in Texas earlier this year and said she appeared to have moved on with her life. ‘We never expected something like this to happen,’ he added. According to the Associated Press, murder victim Katie Stay traveled to Utah last fall to help her sister Melanie get away from the abusive marriage. Melanie never moved into her new home. The couple’s divorce was finalized on February 14 and part of their divorce decree required Haskell to obtain a psychological evaluation and provide documentation that he is emotionally and mentally stable enough to care for his children without supervision. A judge granted joint custody of the couple’s four kids, with Haskell’s wife getting primary custody. The Haskells were married in California in 2002. They separated in June of 2013. In August of 2013, Melanie reported a protective order violation to police. Parents: Katie and Stephen Stay were shot dead . in their Houston home along with four of their five children by their . former brother-in-law, Ron Haskell . In October of 2013, Melanie reported another possible protective order violation because Haskell had shown up at one of the children’s elementary schools. This protective order was actually served on him the day of the complaint. 'Neither protective order violations were prosecuted,' police said in a statement. Today support for the devastated Stay family is still growing and a fund set up to raise money for them has reached almost $150,000 with a new goal of $200,000. Former Navy officer Jody Dellinger, a District Manager at Harris County Parks and Recreation, set up the fund with first responder Sergeant George Beck, the officer who found the massacre scene in Spring, Texas. Jody wrote on the site this morning: ‘We just broke $106,000 this morning at 0840, only about 20 hours after the site was created. This incredible outpouring has already brought this ole, rough, retired Navy Chief to tears! I cannot express how proud and excited I am to be a part of such an awesome show of love that this site has become!’ Meanwhile, the lone teenage survivor of the cold-blooded attack was released from hospital today, according to Children's Memorial Hermann Hospital. In to a statement the hospital said the 15-year-old was discharged earlier this afternoon in good condition and is expected to make a full recovery. 'As a hospital team, we were honored to be able to help care for this brave young woman at her critical time of need. The entire staff at Children's Memorial Hermann Hospital has been profoundly touched by Cassidy's resilient spirit, inner strength, and hopeful heart during this time of indescribable shock and grief,' the hospital said. 'We extend our deepest sympathies and condolences to her, and her extended family, as they begin the difficult healing process.' Cassidy had been hailed a hero after playing dead when Ron Haskell allegedly shot her in the head before executing we whole family. She escaped with her life and called the police shortly after Haskell left the home in Spring, Texas.Her mother, father and four siblings all lay dead next to her. Cassidy was able to warn police that the shooter had left to find her grandparents and shoot them too. Her grandparents have said they are in 'awe' of her bravery. Cassidy was always expected to make a full physical recovery after it emerged that amazingly the bullet only grazed her head. But she reportedly also lost a finger in the attack.","Police in Houston, Texas, arrested 33-year-old Haskell Wednesday night after a tense stand-off at a suburban cul-de-sac .

"A super-religious former college football star and his wife turned themselves in Friday to face charges they kept his eldest son prisoner in the basement for two years because he had ‘sinned’ by stealing a DVD player. Strict Recardo Wimbush Sr, 33, and wife Therian Cornelia Wimbush, 37, made their first court appearance Friday after police say they imprisoned 13-year-old Recardo Jr as punishment for his ‘wicked’ act to keep him on the ‘straight and narrow.' The parents were each charged with false imprisonment and cruelty to children, they are being held without bail, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Strict: Recardo Wimbush Sr (left) and Therian Wimbush (right) are being held without bond after turning themselves in to face multiple charges for imprisoning their son . Recardo Wimbush, Sr, a devotee of a religion dedicated to Yah, allegedly locked his son, 13, in the basement of the family home for two years . Wimbush and his wife Therian Wimbush (pictured) have been charged with child abuse and their 10 children taken into care . The former Georgia Tech standout and spouse Therian Wimbush were so angry with the boy's actions that he was banned from having any contact with his nine younger siblings. He was also barred from reading books or having toys while locked up in the tiny, sparsely furnished room with all the windows blacked out. Gwinnett County police have now charged former Georgia Tech football star Wimbush and his wife with cruelty to children. The couple – both devoted to an unusual religion which worships Yah - told investigators they had locked Recardo Jr in the basement for 'disciplinary reasons,' said Corporal Jake Smith, spokesman for Gwinnett Police. 'The victim had been confined to the room for most of the past two years and a lock had been added to the victim’s room in January 2013,' Smith said.

Recardo Wimbush wearing the number 42 shirt for the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets . 'The victim had no access to books, toys, entertainment devices, or his siblings.' Social workers discovered the boy was being confined to a small room that contained a bare box springs and mattress and 'a large plastic jar, which was apparently used as a toilet,' Smith said. The Buford couple was charged with malicious and intentional cruelty to children and false imprisonment and must turn themselves in to authorities by the end of the day Friday. The Wimbushes told a judge at a June 19 family court hearing that the 13-year-old was a threat to their other children. But according to sources the child claims he was being punished for stealing a DVD player that wasn’t his. The . arrest warrant said the child was 'sent to the basement of the family . house for the past two years in deplorable conditions due to being . disobedient.' The family live in a large home in Buford, north of Atlanta, Georgia. Strict: The Wimbush children (Recardo Jr pictured center back) are home-schooled and their parents are known to be disciplinarians . Harsh punishment: Recardo Wimbush with son Recardo Wimbush, Jr as a baby, who was allegedly kept in a basement with no light and nothing to occupy his mind for two years . There is a slide and child’s swings in the back yard but neighbors said the children were held to a strict regime. Neighbor Pam Harris, 46, says the family moved in around 11 years ago. She said they are strict disciplinarians who rarely allowed the children to talk to ‘strangers’. ‘They were a very odd family, they had ten children who were all home schooled and nicely dressed but weren’t allowed to be sociable. ‘You would . never see the children playing outside on their own or in twos or . threes, they would only ever go outside all together as a family with . the parents watching. ‘They seemed very strict disciplinarians. They didn’t believe in Christmas and didn’t celebrate Halloween. ‘If children in the neighborhood knocked on their door for trick or treat the parents would hand out bibles instead of candy.’ Mrs Harris said the children were home-schooled. She also said the family often displayed religious messages and posters on their front door. She . said: ‘Once they had a notice on their door that blew in to my yard. It . said those who work on Sunday should be put to death. ‘It’s . so sad that that little boy was kept in the basement, we heard he had . sinned and stolen a DVD player, but they told police it was something . worse. That poor boy.’ Mrs Harris said police came to the property last Thursday after a tip off and removed the ten children. An . undated family website shows a large, seemingly happy family and . explained the importance of religion and its devotion to ‘Yah’. On . the website Recardo and his wife preach their family purpose as being . ‘Wisely Instructed Meek Believers Uncompromising & Steadfast in . Humility (WIMBUSH). They say the Wimbush vision is to: ‘Be a family of Yah that, much like Mosheh, is found TRUSTWORTHY in all YAH’s House!!!’ Family website: The site contains family pictures and statements about their religious beliefs . Sporting career: Wimbush attended Georgia Tech where he was a star football player . Full of secrets: The family moved into this home 11 years ago and neighbors say the children were never allowed to play outside unless under the watchful eyes of their parents . In amongst dozens of family photos the family vision is stated as: ‘Love and Fear YAH or Elohim, Guard His Charge: even His laws, and His right rulings, and His commands, ALWAYS!!! Serve Him, and cling to HIM and swear by HIS Name.’ Photos include a family group shot with the whole family dressed in white , individual snaps of the children including one of their pet dog Budd and photos of muscle bound ‘daddy’ Wimbush and ‘mommy’ Therian. JAH is the shortened form of the divine name YHWH (also spelled Jehovah or Yahweh), an anglicized version of the Tetragrammaton. Recardo Jr was one of three children the couple had while at Georgia Tech where Wimbush was a linebacker captain of the football team during his 2002 senior season. Therian was a tutor when they met before she was graduated with duel degrees from Tech and Spelman College in 2000. Recardo was described as a diaper-changing dad who got furloughs from team duties to be with his family. 'I knew I always wanted kids,' he then told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 'They bring a bright spot to your heart, and they have with me.' According to the Atlanta Journal the charges shocked Wimbush’s former teammate Jeremy Muyres - who was a co-captain with Wimbush on the 2002 team. 'The one thing I do know is Recardo’s one of the best guys I’ve ever been around,' said Muyres, a teacher and football coach at Norcross High School. Overzealous: The family often posted religious messages and posters on their front door, one of which stated that people who work on Sundays should be put to death . Rescued: Recardo Wimbush, Sr, with son Recardo Wimbush, Jr (bottom front) and two of his other children . Broken family: Therian Wimbush, with one of the couple's many children, has been charged with child abuse after a tip-off to police . 'Obviously, hearing about it, it’s shocking, but I don’t know all the details. None of us do yet.' The warrants arose out of an investigation by the Department of Family and Children Services following an anonymous tip. The boy was in good health, as were his nine siblings, and there were no other signs of abuse. After a hearing, a judge removed all the children from the house and contacted Gwinnett Police who searched the house the next day,  Cpl. Smith, said. Detectives found that the boy was fed at normal meal times and that the room was kept clean; the parents had added a sheet to the make-shift bed since the visit by the social workers, Smith said. But detectives don’t believe the boy was being schooled - none of the children attended public school - and was only occasionally let out to use the bathroom, Smith said. The room was dark, with no light bulb in its fixture and the 'single window was painted white which let in a small amount of light during daylight hours,' Smith said. Wimbush, who grew up in Blakely, was a Georgia Tech linebacker from 1999 to 2002 and was the team captain his senior year, the same year he was a second-team All-Atlantic Coast Conference selection. According to the Atlanta Journal he was a standout athlete not only for team records, but also because he pursued his degree at the university after his athletic eligibility ended. He earned it in 2010. Wimbush signed with the Falcons in April 2003 as an undrafted free agent but was released after training camp. 'I just remember he was always a good guy, always did the right thing,' Muyres said. 'He was a guy who would always have your back, a guy who would always be there for you, a guy you could count on. He was just that type of person.'","Recardo Wimbush, Sr, 33, and Therian Cornelia Wimbush, 37, turned themselves in Friday to Gwinnett County authorities .

"The father of Bowe Bergdahl is seen here for the first time without the long beard and ponytail he grew while his son was held by the Taliban for five years before his controversial release. Bob Bergdahl, 55, raised a few eyebrows when he stood next to President Obama during his announcement of Bergdahl's release at a White House press conference at the end of May. But today – more than six weeks after his son's release - Bob was clean-shaven as he left a bike repair shop where he works in his hometown of Hailey, Idaho. Scroll down for video . Clean shaven: Bob Bergdahl looks strikingly similar to his son without the long beard and ponytail he has appeared in public with before . 'Estrangement': His son Bowe has not spoken to his parents in the six weeks that he has been free . In these exclusive photos Bob worked on a bike outside the repair shop and yesterday was picked up by wife Jani and donned sunglasses and a baseball cap. But Bob's new look can't mask an apparent family rift. Astonishingly, it emerged that Bergdahl has refused to speak with his parents since he was released from captivity in Pakistan six weeks ago. And today the POW's lawyer refused to say whether he had any plans to return to his hometown. An army official reportedly told the Wall Street Journal that the sergeant has refused to see his parents in person or even speak to them on the phone, suggesting 'a deeper estrangement between the soldier and his parents than the military understood when he was released'. The precise cause of the estrangement isn't known, but if true it must come as a bitter blow to Bob who dedicated his life to bringing Bowe home. Bob had been growing the facial hair ever since his son was . kidnapped by Taliban warlords in Afghanistan in 2009. Bob . – who dedicated his life to finding Bowe – vowed not to shave until his . son returned home safely and the beard became a symbol of his quest. Sgt Bergdahl had been held captive by the Haqqani Network for five years before he was released to U.S. Special Forces in May as part of a prisoner swap. Under that deal, Bergdahl was set free in exchange for the release of five Taliban detainees at Guantanamo Bay. The White House quickly hailed Bergdahl's release as a victory but the matter soon became embroiled in controversy as lawmakers complained they weren't given sufficient notice of the planned swap and warned of national security risks of releasing leading Taliban figures. To add to the fallout several former members of Bergdahl's platoon branded him a deserter and a traitor and said other soldiers had given their lives trying to rescue them. Support: Bob Bergdahl grew his beard and hair long during the five years his son spent in captivity and appeared at the White House when Sgt Bergdahl's release was announced . Deserter? Bergdahl now faces an Army investigation into the circumstances that led to him being taken captive . Bergdahl now faces a military investigation into the circumstances that led to him being taken captive. Bergdhal returned to active duty on Monday after finishing an intensive debriefing and therapy program at a military hospital in San Antonio, Texas. Bob, a former UPS driver, has worked tirelessly advocating for his son over the past five years while he was held by the Taliban. He learned the Pashto language, read in to the history of the Taliban and grew his beard in order to better communicate with them. 'Bowe has been gone so long, it’s going to be very difficult to come back,' he warned a few days after his son’s release. 'If he comes up too fast, it could kill him.' It was widely assumed that they would reunite after he returned to the United States and Bergdahl would be welcomed home to Hailey amid fanfare and open arms. Bergdahl returned to a 'desk job' at Fort Sam Houston this week and continues to live in army barracks in Texas. He thanked Obama for saving his life this week and his newly-appointed military justice lawyer Eugene Fidell insisted overnight the former POW is 'proud' to be back in uniform. 'Sergeant Bergdahl is deeply grateful to President Obama for saving his life,' Fidell, a Yale Law School professor who is working pro bono, told The Daily Beast on Wednesday. Fidell also appeared on the Today show on Thursday to defend his client, insisting that he was proud to be serving the U.S., despite earlier correspondence that showed him slating his nation. 'I believe he is [proud],' Fidell said. 'He's back to duty.' Jani drives Bob home from work at Sun Summit South bike shop on Thursday evening . Fidell met personally with Bergdahl last . week at the base. Bergdahl also has an Army lawyer representing him and . the two lawyers will work together. Fidell said he has met with the . sergeant and hopes to ‘facilitate’ the next chapter of his life. 'We . had extensive conversations last week,' he told MailOnline. 'The chemistry between . us is good and I enjoyed being with him, I like him based on what I’ve . seen. 'I’m . happy to be representing him and I and the other lawyers I am going to . be working with are going to give him our best efforts. 'I . hope we can facilitate the transition to the next chapter of his life. He’s got to move in to the next chapter and pursue his education and put . Afghanistan behind him. 'He . wants to pursue an education and be normal, another citizen in the . crowd. 'He doesn’t know what course he wants to do yet but that’s his . plan. Bowe is just really looking forward to putting this behind him.' Fidell told MailOnline that he doesn’t know whether Bergdahl intends to return to his . hometown of Hailey, Idaho and won’t be drawn on his relationship with . his parents and why it appears he hasn’t spoken to them yet. Fidell said Major General Kenneth Dahl, who is heading the investigation into the circumstances surrounding Bergdahl's disappearance from his outpost in Afghanistan, had not yet interviewed his client. He said he didn't expect Dahl to have any substantive interviews with Bergdahl for a couple of weeks. Bergdahl has not been charged with any crimes. In a . statement, the Army said that the soldier 'has completed the final phase . of the reintegration process under the control of U.S. Army South and . is currently being assigned to U.S. Army North, Joint Base San . Antonio-Fort Sam Houston (JBSA). 'He . will now return to regular duty within the command where he can . contribute to the mission. The Army investigation into the facts and . circumstances surrounding the disappearance and capture of Bergdahl is . still ongoing.' Fox . reported that Bergdahl may also receive $350,000 from the US government . without paying taxes: $200,000 would be for wages earned during his . captivity and $150,000 if he in fact was a POW. Mind . games: This photo of Bergdahl smiling with Taliban Commander Badruddin . Haqqani was posted on Twitter recently and raised more questions about . his time in captivity . When he was swapped for five Guantanamo Bay detainees on May 31, Obama said the switch had been prompted by Bergdahl's poor health. But his former comrades have insisted he abandoned his post - putting others in danger - and last week, on a Twitter account associated with the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, a user said Bergdahl had been treated with kindness by his captors. MailOnline yesterday approached Bob in Hailey but he refused to comment. He . appeared down and gloomy and hid in the back of the business where he . works repairing bikes. Close friend Chip, 54, . says Bob has had enough of the media attention and the controversy that . has surrounded his family and 'isn't interested' in discussing his son. ‘He’s not interested, he thinks it’s a fiasco,’ said Chip.","Bob Bergdahl raised eyebrows when he appeared alongside President Obama to announce release of son Bowe after 5 years in Taliban captivity .

"Feathered dinosaurs may have learned to fly before the evolution of birds, a new fossil find suggests. The long tail feathers of the Changyuraptor, a 'four-winged' dinosaur from China, would have provided stability and speed control for a safe landing. Measuring 4ft (1.2 metres) long and weighing 9lbs (4kg), the creature lived 125 million years ago, and was the biggest dinosaur of its type ever discovered. The well-preserved fossil (pictured) shows that a full set of feathers cloaked the entire body of the Changyuraptor.

Although . birds have a dinosaur ancestry, dinosaurs themselves were thought to . have stayed on the ground, despite some of them sporting rudimentary . feathers. The Changyuraptor discovery blurs the lines between dinosaurs and the first early birds such as the magpie-sized Archaeopteryx. For larger flyers, safe landings are of particular importance - hence the significance of the tail feathers. The well-preserved fossil, unearthed in Liaoning Province in northeastern China, shows that a full set of feathers cloaked its entire body. In comparison with its body size, the foot-long tail feathers were unusually long. 'Four-winged' dinosaurs, known as microraptorines, are so called because the long feathers attached to their legs have the appearance of a second set of wings. In fact, the well-developed feathers on both legs and arms have led scientists to wonder if the creatures were capable of flight. Dr Alan . Turner, from Stony Brook University, New York, one of the authors of the . new research published in the journal Nature Communications, said: . 'Numerous features that we have long associated with birds in fact . evolved in dinosaurs long before the first birds arrived on the scene. 'This includes things such as hollow bones, nesting behaviour, feathers, and possibly flight.' During . the reign of the dinosaurs, flight evolved both in birds and pterosaurs . - reptiles that included some creatures the size of a small aircraft.

'It makes sense that the largest microraptorines had especially large tail feathers, they would have needed the additional control,' said co-author Dr Michael Habib, from the University of Southern California. 'The new fossil documents that dinosaur flight was not limited to very small animals but to dinosaurs of more substantial size,' said study leader Dr Luis Chiappe, from the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. 'Clearly far more evidence is needed to understand the nuances of dinosaur flight, but Changyuraptor is a major leap in the right direction.'","The fossil of the Changyuraptor was unearthed in Liaoning Province, China .

"Google has signed a deal with health giant Novartis to produce its groundbreaking smart contact lenses. The two will first produce a glucose monitoring lens for diabetics and one to treat farsightedness, it was announced. However, the firm hinted at 'other uses' for the technology - and has recently patented a lens with a built in camera. Google is testing a prototype for a smart contact lens that we built to measure glucose in tears continuously using a wireless chip and miniaturized glucose sensor. The Google lens contains a control circuit, an image capture (camera) component and an image sensor. The system can be wirelessly linked to a mobile phone for data access and to issue commands via audio, although it is unclear if the lens would be powered wirelessly or have a wired link to a battery. 'Novartis announced that its eye care division Alcon has entered into an agreement with a division of Google to license its 'smart lens' technology for all ocular medical uses,' the firm said. The deal is the first to involve the smart lenses, and follow several deal to work with other manufacturers on Glass, the firm's wearable computer. 'Our dream is to use the latest technology in the miniaturization of electronics to help improve the quality of life for millions of people,' said Sergey Brin, Co-Founder of  Google. 'We are very excited to work with Novartis to make this dream come true. 'We are looking forward to working with Google to bring together their advanced technology and our extensive knowledge of biology to meet unmet medical needs,' said Novartis CEO Joseph Jimenez. 'This is a key step for us to go beyond the confines of traditional disease management, starting with the eye.' Under the agreement, Google[x] and Alcon will collaborate to develop a 'smart lens' that has the potential to address ocular conditions. The smart lens technology involves non-invasive sensors, microchips and other miniaturized electronics which are embedded within contact lenses. The first product will help diabetic patients manage their disease by providing a continuous, minimally invasive measurement of the body's glucose levels via a 'smart contact lens' which is designed to measure tear fluid in the eye and connects wirelessly with a mobile device. The second will help the farsighted. How it works: The chip includes a sensor, chip and antenna to let wearers know when their glucose levels are dangerously low . 'For people living with presbyopia who can no longer read without glasses, the ""smart lens"" has the potential to provide accommodative vision correction to help restore the eye's natural autofocus on near objects in the form of an accommodative contact lens or intraocular lens as part of the refractive cataract treatment,' the firms said. 'Alcon and Google have a deep and common passion for innovation,' said Jeff George, Division Head of Alcon. 'By combining Alcon's leadership in eye care and expertise in contact lenses and intraocular lenses with Google's innovative 'smart lens' technology and groundbreaking speed in research, we aim to unlock a new frontier to jointly address the unmet medical needs of millions of eye care patients around the world.' Earlier this year it was revealed Google has patented a smart contact lens that could see its Glass wearable computer fit inside a smart lens, opening the possibility of its Glass system being shrunk down significantly, offering features such as 'superzoom' to wearers and even helping the blind see. Glass without the glass: Google patent contact lens camera . According to PatentBolt, the system could even be used to help the blind see. 'For example, a blind person wearing Google's contact lens with a built-in camera may be walking on a sidewalk and approaching an intersection,' it says. 'The analysis component of the contact lens can process the raw image data of the camera to determine processed image data indicating that the blind person is approaching intersection with a crosswalk and establish that there is a car approaching the intersection.' The lens also has wireless capabilities allowing it to link to a smartphone, which can be used to process data and give the user audio commands. Google also says the system will be able to detect faces, potentially allowing the blind to recognise people. The firm is already in discussion with the FDA over the project . 'We’re now testing a smart contact lens that’s built to measure glucose levels in tears using a tiny wireless chip and miniaturized glucose sensor that are embedded between two layers of soft contact lens material,' they said. 'We’re testing prototypes that can generate a reading once per second. How they are made: The process starts with a tiny chip, which is then mounted on a ring with the antenna and sensor, and finally mounted onto the lens.","Google has signed deal with Novartis to produce lenses .

"The mother of a Georgia toddler who died after being left in a hot car for seven hours has told authorities that she had previously researched such deaths and how they occur. Leanna Harris’ husband Justin is currently in jail without bond accused of killing their son Cooper, who was 22 months old when he died on June 18. According to a police affidavit released on Sunday, Cobb County police say Leanna Harris has admitted to researching child deaths in hot cars online, but has not been charged.

And in an emotional speech Harris' wife Leanna took . to the stage to defend her husband. Suspicious: Police say Justin Ross Harris admitted to researching child death shortly before son Cooper Harris was declared dead in a shopping center parking lot . She asked the congregation: 'Am I angry with Ross? Absolutely not. It never ever has crossed my mind. Ross is and always will be, . if we have more children, a wonderful daddy, a wonderful leader for our . children.' She added: 'Cooper meant the world to him, there was . not a day go by that we did not say how blessed we were to have him in our . lives.' Leanna said she had felt compelled to speak in . defense of her husband and remember Cooper. She told him as he listened in: 'Ross I love you, I . am doing this for you okay. 'I should be crumpled in a heap of snot and tears . into the dirt, but The Lord is holding me up...he is holding Ross up.' Forgiveness: Hearing Ross's words wife Leanna told the crowd she believed in her husband . Harris described Cooper as peaceful with his eyes closed, when this wasn't the case, according to Stoddard. He allegedly also told his wife: 'I dreaded how he would look' Not welcome: Justin Ross Harris was banned from the funeral for Cooper held at the University Church of Christ . Leanna also recalled bringing 6lbs 8oz Cooper in to . the world. 'He was perfect,' she said, adding, 'He changed my . life and he changed Ross' life.' She also recalled how Cooper had struggled to sleep . in the two nights before his death and had spent the night sleeping in between . her and Ross in their bed. She remembers waking and looking at him. 'I will cherish that moment forever.' Earlier a family member had come on to the stage and . asked the audience to join him in a round of applause for baby Cooper. Saying Goodbye: Dozens gathered to mourn the short life of Cooper Harris on Saturday . Security: The church was closely gaurded as mourners shared their grief over Cooper's loss . After the claps slowed, the man said: 'Hey Ross that . sounded pretty good.' To which Ross responded: 'Yes it did.' Leanna's father Dock Taylor spoke of Cooper as a . 'wonderful little man'. 'He lived full for 22-months of his life. 'His family loved and adored and worshipped him and . we will for the rest of our days.' He added that 'nobody in this world' loved him more . than Ross and Leanna. He said Harris called him his 'handsome little . buddy'. Harris could be heard crying over the phone as Mr . Taylor spoke and the religious service progressed. Investigating: An updated arrest warrant shows Justin Harris took his 22-month-old son, Cooper, to breakfast shortly before the little boy was left to die in a hot SUV . Celebrating life: A family member came on to the stage and asked the audience to join him in a round of applause for baby Cooper . Harris, 33, was supposed to drop Cooper . at daycare around 9.30am on June 18 but instead went straight to work after . first stopping for breakfast at a Chick-Fil-A restaurant. He forget the boy was strapped in his car seat in the . back of the Hyundai Tuscon for seven hours - on a day when temperatures soared . into the 90s. Baby Cooper wasn’t discovered until 4.20 p.m. after . Harris has left work and suddenly pulled into a parking lot at Uncle Maddio’s . Pizza restaurant at a nearby shopping center. According to the search warrants Harris ‘quickly . exited the vehicle opened the driver side passenger door and pulled his child, . Cooper Harris out of the vehicle.’ It continued: ‘Justin was witnessed yelling 'Oh . my god what have I done.' He then began doing CPR on the child. When . someone came to assist Justin he stopped providing medical attention to the . child and started making calls on his cell phone. Memories: Mourners recalled Cooper as a happy boy who loved cars and trucks . Friends had previously described Harris and his wife as being the 'most proud parents there ever could have been' over their son Cooper . EMS responded to the scene. It . was obvious that the child was deceased. But witnesses told MailOnline that Harris was 'acting . oddly' and that he had told bystanders who tried to save the tot that the child . had been ‘choking’ minutes earlier. Instead of confessing to the tragic blunder of having . left the child in the car all day – and admitting his baby had been dead for . hours – it was claimed Harris had tried to cover his tracks. The mystery deepened even further when the police . later revealed that Harris had returned to his SUV at lunchtime and was seen . placing an object in the car via the driver’s side door. Leanna . wanted to obtain photos of her son from the seized computers for use at the . funeral, but Cobb County police turned down her request, said Maddox Kilgore, . the attorney for Harris.

"The father charged with murder after his toddler son died after he left him in his scorching hot car has been barred from attending his son’s funeral, it was revealed today. Justin Ross Harris, 33, won’t be allowed to attend a planned service for 22-month-old Cooper in his home town of Tuscaloosa, Alabama on Saturday. In many states, inmates are granted a temporary leave of absence – or furlough – on compassionate grounds to attend funerals. Scroll down for video . Barred: Justin Harris - pictured with wife Leanna and son Cooper -  won't be able to attend the church service for his dead son on Saturday as he is in custody on a felony murder charge . Anger: The news will come as a blow to the 11,000 people who have signed a petition for the charges to be dropped against Harris, who they claim the grief of losing Cooper is punishment enough . Pre-trial inmates - such as Harris - can request permission under a special court order but Cobb County in Georgia where the death occurred does not grant them under any circumstances. Cobb County Sheriff’s Department, which is in charge of Harris’ detention, told MailOnline: ‘We do not transport inmates to funeral services, that’s it, that’s our policy.’ The news will come as a blow to Harris who is awaiting trial accused of felony murder and second degree child cruelty. It will also anger more than 11,000 people who have signed a petition pleading with the Cobb County District Attorney’s office to 'drop the murder charges,' believing they are too harsh for a caring father who has been punished enough with the loss of his child. The funeral is to be held on Saturday at 1pm at the University Church of Christ in Tuscaloosa. A private family burial is also being planned in Tuscaloosa after the service. Yesterday when approached by the MailOnline, baby Cooper’s grandmother – the mother of Harris’ wife Leanna – said the family was still ‘grieving’. She simply said: ‘Sorry we have been told not to say anything, we are still grieving’. Supporters: Friends released this picture of the 'caring father' on Facebook on Wednesday night - but police countered with a statement saying it was not a case of 'simple negligence' Cause of death: Police announced on Wednesday that Cooper's cause of death was hyperthermia and the result of homicide . Harris’ father Kermit Harris also refused to comment, only saying: ‘We’re all supporting him.’ The news comes as more disturbing details have emerged about the death after police said that there was much more to the case than simple negligence. Cobb County Medical Examiner's office announced on Wednesday night that little Cooper Harris' cause of death was hyperthermia - or intense heat exhaustion - and confirmed the manner of his death was a homicide. It has also been alleged Harris had used his office computer to search how long it would take for an animal to die trapped in the back of a hot car. A law enforcement source in the Georgia county reportedly told Fox 5 News that investigators seized Justin Ross Harris' work computer at Home Depot after his arrest last week and that an internet search suggested the child's death was premeditated. A police warrant revealed Wednesday that Harris took his son for breakfast at the Vinings Chick-fil-A before driving to work. He then returned to the car at lunch time to place an object in the car before leaving the child again. Earlier this week the MailOnline revealed the father was 'acting oddly' and told bystanders who tried to save the child that he had been 'choking' minutes earlier. Suspicion: Police have alleged that Harris checked on the car which Cooper was in at lunchtime. Witnesses allege he pretended Cooper was choking when he stopped the car after leaving work in a parking lot that is a ten minute drive away. Lastly, cops believe he searched the internet for information on how long an animal can survive in a hot car in the days before Cooper's death . Harris was supposed to drop Cooper to daycare around 9 a.m. last Wednesday but instead went straight to work, allegedly forgetting the boy was strapped in his car seat in the back of the vehicle for seven hours. But instead of confessing to the tragic blunder – and admitting his baby had been dead for hours – it has been claimed Harris tried to cover his tracks by driving to a nearby shopping center with the dead child and telling onlookers the child had just been choking. The Cobb County Police Department called for the public's patience in the case in a statement released Wednesday. They said that during their initial probe, detectives began to obtain physical evidence and testimonial evidence that lead them to believe a more serious crime had been committed that first thought. Chief of police John R. Houser said, 'I . understand that tragic accidents similar to this one do occur... (but) this investigation must be weighed on its own merit and the facts that . lead our detectives to charge the father must be presented at the . appropriate time during the judicial process. Heartbreaking: Leanna Harris is yet to make a public statement about the loss of her son and husband's arrest . 'The chain of events that occurred in this case does not point towards simple negligence and evidence will be presented to support this allegation.' He added finally: 'In fairness to everyone involved in this emotional case, I would ask that you not make conclusions based on rumor or suspicions and let our judicial system work as it is designed.'","Justin Ross Harris, 33, of Marietta, Georgia, is in custody on a controversial murder charge after leaving Cooper to die in hot car when drove to work, parked up and 'forgot' about toddler in back of car .

"Formula milk needs to be reformulated – for boys and girls. Researcher Katie Hinde said just as we produce different deodorants for men and women, we should consider making gender-specific formula milk. Dr Hinde also said that as breast milk varies so much from woman to woman, in some cases supplementing with formula may be better for the baby. Formula milk should be reformulated to be gender-specific, says Dr Katie Hinde, from Harvard University . She spoke out after showing that nursing monkeys make different milk for boys and girls. Milk for male babies is fattier and higher in protein and the milk made for the firstborn male is particularly rich. In contrast, the milk for female babies is less rich but there is more of it. It is also higher in bone-building calcium. The American Association for the Advancement of Science’s annual conference also heard that the few humans studies carried out have had mixed results. But some have also hinted at sex-specific differences. There are also differences in the way the sexes respond to breast milk. Dr Hinde, of Harvard University in the U.S., has shown male and female monkeys respond to the stress hormone cortisol in different ways. And work on human babies found that girls, but not boys, get more fractious if their mother’s milk is high in cortisol. Dr Hinde says some women produce such poor quality breast milk their babies would be better off with formula milk. As a result, she says it's important women are not made to feel guilty if they don't breastfeed . However, in rat studies at least, this has long term benefits, with the animals actually better at coping with stressful situations than others. Research also shows that the quality of breast milk varies greatly from woman to woman, with different amounts of vitamins, minerals, sugars, fats and other nutrients. In some cases, the quality is so low that formula may be better. However, women are made to feel guilty if they don’t breastfeed, said Dr Hinde. Calling for more research on sex-specific formula milk, she said: ‘Public health would be aided if greater attention was paid to this. ‘We have good reasons to be sceptical of a one-size-fits-all formula milk.’","Dr Katie Hinde, from Harvard, says formula milk could be gender-specific .

"The mother of a baby girl who died from whooping cough claims she was not offered a simple vaccine available to pregnant mothers which can protect newborns from the disease. Five-week-old Violet Herdman, died on May 1, after being rushed to hospital as she struggled to breathe. Her parents Emma Sharp, 33, and Colin Herdman, 34, claim doctors failed to spot the signs of whooping cough in time to save their daughter. The couple, from Morpeth in Northumberland, said despite Violet's lips turning blue as she gasped for breath, medics at Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust missed opportunities to diagnose her condition. Five-week-old Violet Herdman died on May 1 after being diagnosed with whooping cough. Her parents Emma Sharp and Colin Herdman are urging all pregnant women to make sure they are vaccinated against the disease, after claiming Ms Sharp was not offered the jab while pregnant with their daughter . They said Violet was diagnosed as having a chest infection, and was discharged a day after being admitted for tests. Sales assistant Ms Sharp said despite regular antenatal appointments she was not offered the whooping cough vaccine. She and her partner today urged other pregnant women to learn about the vaccine and to insist on having the jab, to try and help prevent other families face a similar ordeal. The Department of Health launched a vaccination programme advising all expectant mothers are offered the jab, after a surge in cases during 2012. The NHS Choices website states: . 'You may be offered the vaccination at a routine antenatal appointment . when you are between 28 and 38 weeks pregnant. 'If you are over 28 . weeks pregnant and have not been offered the vaccine, talk to your . midwife or GP and make an appointment to get vaccinated.' Violet was born premature at 33 weeks on March 26 at Wansbeck Hospital. Despite struggling to feed the newborn was discharged 10 days later, with a clean bill of health. But within weeks her parents became concerned when their daughter lost interest in feeding, and appeared to be struggling to breathe. She was admitted to North Tyneside Hospital on April 27 for tests. Her parents claim staff discharged her a day later, telling them their daughter had a chest infection. Violet's condition deteriorated, and the next day Ms Sharp had to resuscitate her at home in front of her other children. The couple returned to the hospital and claim they were told Violet may have pneumonia. She was transferred to the Great North Children's Hospital in Newcastle, where she was put on a ventilator. An investigation has been launched by Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, after Ms Sharp and Mr Heldman claim doctors missed opportunities to diagnose Violet's condition . Ms Sharp said it was when her daughter suffered a cardiac arrest - thought to have been caused by a blood infection - that she and her partner were told their daughter had whooping cough. By that time Ms Sharp said the couple were told nothing more could be done for Violet. After having their daughter baptised in hospital, they took the devastating decision to switch off her life support. Ms Sharp, who has four other children aged 22 months to 12, said: 'Violet’s death has left the entire family in pieces and at the moment it feels like every day is a struggle. 'We only had two weeks of her at home . and I cannot help but think of all the things she missed out on – it’s . absolutely heart breaking. 'She was a perfect baby, she slept well, fed well and had a lovely temperament. 'I knew there was something seriously . wrong with Violet and never believed she should have been discharged . from hospital when she had stopped breathing so many times, but the . staff were adamant she was fine. Whooping cough is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the lungs and airways. The medical term for whooping cough is pertussis. The condition usually begins with a persistent dry and irritating cough that progresses to intense bouts of coughing. These are followed by a distinctive 'whooping' noise, which is how the condition gets its name. Other symptoms include a runny nose, raised temperature and vomiting after coughing. The coughing can last for around three months. In the UK, all pregnant women are offered vaccination against whooping cough when they are 28-38 weeks pregnant. Getting vaccinated while you’re pregnant could help to protect your baby from developing whooping cough in its first few weeks of life. Children are vaccinated against whooping cough with the 5-in-1 vaccine at two, three and four months of age, and again with the 4-in-1 pre-school booster before starting school at the age of about three years and four months. Whooping cough is a cyclical disease with the number of cases peaking every three to four years. The numbers were high in 2012: in the first 10 months of the year, there were 7,728 reported cases in the UK, with 13 babies having died. During the whole of 2011 there were only 910 cases in England and Wales. Source: NHS Choices . 'Having to resuscitate her at home in front of my children was absolutely horrendous and I’m sure will continue to affect us all for years to come.' Ms Sharp, who said she had no knowledge the vaccine was available to pregnant woment, added: 'After Violet’s death I researched whooping cough and was shocked to discover that all pregnant women should be vaccinated. 'I learnt that the best time to get the injection was between 28 and 32 weeks and with Violet being born at over 33 weeks I cannot understand why I slipped through the net. 'Two of my previous children have been premature so there was a chance Violet would also be premature. 'Before we can even begin to think about coming to terms with what has happened, Colin and I need answers about why I was not offered a vaccine and why no link was made between Violet’s symptoms and whooping cough. 'Nothing can turn back the clock for us but for Violet’s death not to be completely in vain we need reassurance that every NHS Trust provides vaccines for pregnant women and that staff are trained to recognise the condition so it can be treated appropriately. 'It’s too late for Violet but it might just help prevent another family going through the same hell as us.' The government introduced a whooping cough, or pertussis, vaccination programme for pregnant women in 2012, in response to a rise in cases. Public Health England guidelines say: 'It is important for all women to be offered the pertussis vaccine during each pregnancy whilst the temporary programme is in place.' Following Violet’s death law firm Irwin Mitchell have launched an investigation into her death. Medical law expert Michelle Armstrong, from Irwin Mitchell, said: 'This is a tragic case and Violet’s parents have been left devastated by her sudden death. 'Violet’s cause of death was found to be multi-organ failure and a lung infection caused by whooping cough. 'We will now begin investigations to discover why Emma did not receive a vaccine during pregnancy, as well as why it was not recognised that Violet’s symptoms of a cough and breathing difficulties were related to whooping cough which needed immediate treatment.' A spokesperson for Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust said: 'We would like to extend our sincere condolences to Violet’s family for their tragic loss earlier this year.' 'We are in touch with Violet’s parents and are already fully investigating the circumstances surrounding their daughter’s death. 'This investigation is ongoing and it would be inappropriate for us to comment further until we have completed this thorough investigation and shared the findings with Violet’s parents.'","Violet Herdman died on May 1 after tests revealed she had whooping cough .

"Nicola Mansfield is pictured with husband John on their wedding day . A mother-of-two developed life-threatening brain tumours - just weeks after her husband died from the same illness. Nicola Mansfield was devastated when just two weeks after their honeymoon, her husband John collapsed and was diagnosed with a brain tumour that developed into brain cancer. With her husband not expected to survive the year, she became pregnant and was able to tell him the news two days before he died at 35. But shortly after the tragedy, and expecting twins, she too discovered she had developed potentially deadly brain tumours. The couple, from Darlington in County Durham, were told in January 2012 that Mr Mansfield was terminally ill. They enjoyed one last holiday together and after a weekend in the Lake District, Nicola decided to make her husband’s final wish come true. She said: 'We came back from our holiday talking about baby names and I knew I had to make his dream come true so I asked him how he’d feel if I tried to get pregnant before he died. 'His biggest dream was to be a father and he was so happy he burst into tears. 'We knew our chances were limited after chemotherapy so we had John’s sperm frozen and, knowing we were living on borrowed time, had two eggs implanted to try and make sure one took. 'The process was really difficult on top of everything else but it was something John really wanted and I wanted to do it for him.' Knowing Mr Mansfield didn’t have long left, his Macmillan nurses arranged an early scan for his wife. However, he lost consciousness the night before his wife found out she was carrying twins. Mrs Mansfield said: 'The nurses said he could hear me so as soon as I came home, I told him - he grunted and that was his way of telling me he knew. 'I think that’s what he was hanging on for as he passed away two days later while I was sat by his bed - I held his hand as he took his last breath, it was the hardest thing I’ve ever done.' It was only following Mr Mansfield’s death that she discovered she too had brain tumours. The same team that nursed her husband went on to care for her, operating when she was 23 weeks pregnant. Nicola Mansfield was able to tell her husband John she was carrying his twins. He died two days later. She is pictured with son Archie John and daughter Ella Kate . Mrs Mansfield, who suffered hearing loss and headaches throughout John’s illness, said: 'The babies were too little to save and I knew there was a chance I could come out without them but that morning I felt calm, as though John was with me and I felt everything would be alright.' She credits the support of friends, family, district and Macmillan nurses with getting her through the hardest time of her life but says without twins Archie John and Ella Kate, she wouldn’t be here to tell her story. 'I didn’t want to continue living without John, it’s the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do and without the twins, I would have given up,' she said. 'I wake up every morning wishing he was here but my babies are the reason I carry on. 'They’re his legacy and they’re amazing - they know who their daddy is and they blow kisses to his picture every night.' Nicola Mansfield, pictured, now helps to raise money for the charity Macmillan Cancer Care . Nicola Mansfield says that without her twins Archie John and Ella Kate, pictured) she wouldn¿t be here to tell her story . The twins are now 15-months-old and their mother is still undergoing treatment for a tumour, facial paralysis and hearing loss. Mrs Mansfield is now fundraising for Macmillan Cancer Care and lending support to other people suffering from cancer. She said: 'Don’t give up, no matter how hard life gets something good will happen - I’ve got my babies to prove it.' When Nicola and John Mansfield met, they knew within seconds that they would end up married. 'It was a whirlwind romance, we clicked from the moment we met,' she said. 'We knew we’d get married and it was a real love story, just like in the films - only ours had a tragic ending.'","Nicola Mansfield's husband John diagnosed two weeks after honeymoon .

"Several nominees at the Academy Awards wore black ribbons on Sunday night to remember Sarah Jones, 27, the camera assistant who was hit by a freight train in Georgia last week during pre-production of the Greg Allman biopic 'Midnight Rider.' Her name and photograph were also projected onto a bumper during the ceremony. Winning director of 'The Lady in Number 6: Music Saved My Life' Malcolm Clarke, 'Gravity' film editor Mark Sanger, and 'Gravity' sound editor Glenn Fremantle all wore ribbons in Jones' memory during their acceptance speeches. At the end of Bette Midler's performance, a bumper with Jones' name was shown to commemorate her and audience members were directed to Oscar.com for a photo gallery of the late camera assistant, reports Indiewire.com . Sarah Jones was only 27 when she died on the set of 'Midnight Rider' during pre-production in Georgia . Director Malcolm Clarke . Film editor Mark Sanger . Sound editor Glenn Freemantle . A bumper with Sarah's name was projected during the ceremony after Bette Midler's performance . Jones died on February 20 when she was struck by a freight train on a train trestle over the Altamaha River near the Doctortown Road crossing in Wayne County, Georgia. Seven other crew members were also injured. Earlier on Sunday, around 700 mourners gathered at Atlanta Botanical Garden's Mershon Hall to remember the talented young crew member. In attendance were family, friends, and one other crew member who was injured during the accident. The Hollywood Reporter writes that the memorial took place just hours before the Academy Awards where a large number of Jones' supporters petitioned the Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences to mention the young woman in the Oscar's 'In Memorium' segment. An online petition collected 62,000 signatures and a facebook and twitter campaign urged attendees to wear the black ribbon in Sarah's memory. Celebrities like Allison Janney and Anna Faris began instagramming and tweeting photos under the hashtag #SlatesForSarah on another facebook page. Stars like Anna Faris and Allison Janney showed their support on #SlatesForSarah . Sarah Jones' supporters rallied to get her commemorated during the ceremony and they succeeded . Though Jones' photograph was not shown along Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Peter O'Toole, James Gandolfini, Shirley Temple, Harold Ramis, and Paul Walker who Hollywood lost earlier this year, she was still commemorated publicly during the ceremony and her friends and family are thankful. The Slates for Sarah facebook page wrote following the ceremony: 'Everyone said it was impossible but the love of Sarah and ""Sarah's Team"" did it!! The Academy saw your slates and heard your voice and Sarah Elizabeth Jones made it to the Oscars as a symbol of a better, safer film world to work in for all the young people coming into the business….We go further working together for change.' The Hollywood Reporter writes that during Jones' memorial, Union leader Bruce Doering announcd that the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) would rename its annual scholorship the Sarah Elizabeth Jones Scholorship. The scholorship will be given to the child of union members interested in following in their parent's footsteps. Doering also spoke of the union's important role in preventing accidents like the one that killed Jones. 'Since this terrible accident happened, we're trying to figure out how this happened and we're committed to taking the issue of unsafe conditions as far as we can take it -- and like Sarah -- full-on,' Doering said. Questions have been raised on whether or not the film had permission to film near the tracks and an investigation is underway.","Documentary director Malcom Clarke and 'Gravity' editors Mark Sanger and Glenn Fremantle all wore a black ribbon during their acceptance speeches .

"A football club has been charged with race victimisation by the FA after it 'refused to pay medical bills' for an injured black striker. Gillingham Football Club and its chairman Paul Scally have been charged over the dismissal of retired striker Mark McCammon after the football governing body judged its rules had been breached. The former Barbados international player sued the club in August 2012 after being sacked the previous year amid claims he was treated differently because he was black. Gillingham Football Club chairman Paul Scally (right) and his club have been charged over the dismissal of former striker Mark McCammon (left) who was sacked in 2011 . He said staff victimised the club's black players and treated them differently to their white team mates. McCammon, 36, claimed the League One club tried to 'frustrate him out' by refusing to pay private medical bills that would help him regain fitness following a serious injury. The club offered the operation on the NHS rather than privately - a move he described as 'completely out of character' for a Football League club. He was then fined two weeks' wages when he paid a visit to a private consultant. McCammon, who signed for Gillingham for £2,500 a week in 2008, told an employment tribunal in 2012 he had been put 'through hell' McCammon claimed he was docked wages when he failed to turn up for training during heavy snow while some white players were told they were not required. He was subsequently dismissed from the club . However, the 6ft 2in striker said an injured white team-mate was flown to Dubai for treatment by an eminent physiotherapist at the club's expense. Mark McCammon, pictured at his employment tribunal in 2012, claimed black players were treated differently to his white teammates . McCammon also claimed he was docked wages when he failed to turn up for training during heavy snow when driving conditions were 'treacherous', while some white players were told they were not required. The striker was subsequently ordered to attend a disciplinary hearing and later received a letter saying he was dismissed. McCammon, who signed for Gillingham for £2,500 a week in 2008, told an employment tribunal in 2012 he had been put 'through hell' and had not been given an answer over why he was treated differently to other players. Dubai-based Gillingham chairman Paul Scally described McCammon's claims as being made 'maliciously and without foundation', adding that the club had not had to deal with an allegation of racism in 18 years. The club lost an appeal last September and the original decision was upheld and they had to pay £68,000 compensation to McCammon, who also played for Doncaster Rovers and Millwall. Now the association say the club breached FA Rule E3 by failing to act in the best interests of the game, and/or bringing the game into disrepute by committing an act of race victimisation by dismissing Mark McCammon. Both Gillingham FC and Mr Scally have until November 14 to respond.","Gillingham Football Club and chairman Paul Scally have been charged .

"A girl who was given no chance of survival before she was born has stunned doctors by growing into a healthy six-year-old. Kaylyn Fry weighed just 1lb 11oz when she arrived 14 weeks early following a range of life-threatening complications in the womb. Her devastated mother, Ayla Blaikie, 28, was even told where she could bury her child after the placenta ruptured just 16 weeks into her pregnancy. Kaylyn Fry (pictured with her mother, Ayla Blaikie), six, was given no chance of survival when the placenta ruptured 16 weeks into her mother's pregnancy . The complications continued and Miss Blaikie’s waters began to leak at 21 weeks. She also needed eight blood transfusions, and contracted life-threatening infections group B streptococcus and MRSA - both of which were passed on to her unborn baby. But against all odds, Kaylyn kept up her fight in the womb until 26 weeks, when a doctor told Miss Blaikie he had never see a baby born alive following so many problems. Now aged six, Kaylyn, who was expected to be blind and brain damaged and who spent three years in and out of hospital with chronic lung conditions, is a picture of health. She has even taken up Tae Kwon Do. Miss Blaikie, from Eyemouth, Scottish Borders, said: ‘Kaylyn was definitely meant to be here. She’s a little fighter - literally. ‘She is such a feisty, outgoing little girl and has overcome so much. It’s amazing.’ After her birth, Kaylyn spent four months clinging to life in two different hospitals, in Newcastle and Edinburgh. Kaylyn survived the placenta rupturing but was in danger again when her mother's waters began to leak at 21 weeks. Things got worse when Ms Blaikie contracted two infections, both of which were passed onto Kaylyn . Eventually, Kaylyn was born 14 weeks early and spent four months in hospital. She also had to be on a ventilator for a week and had to have three blood transfusions . Weighing just 1lb 11oz, she was so small her mother could cup her tiny body in her hands. But despite her minute size, Kaylyn - whose middle name is Hope - put up a big fight as she battled a bleed on her brain, superbug MRSA, and group B streptococcus, which affects just one in 2,000 babies. The bacteria is found in one in three women and normally has no effect on babies. Kaylyn also spent a week on a ventilator, had a hole in her heart and needed three blood transfusions. Even when she was allowed home from hospital after 16 weeks, it was feared she would be blind. Her parents also had to be trained how to resuscitate Kaylyn, who spent a year on oxygen, as her lungs were so underdeveloped. Ms Blaikie says she sees Kaylyn as a 'little miracle' because she survived against the odds . When she was born, Kaylyn weighed just 1lb 11oz and she spent her first three years in and out of hospital . But the youngster, who has also battled countless chest infections and pneumonia, has astounded medics and her parents with her incredible resilience. And as she approaches her seventh birthday next month, Miss Blackie said: ‘Every time it’s her birthday it reminds us of how lucky we are. ‘All though my pregnancy I was constantly being told that they didn’t think she was going to make it. I was even told about the cemetery for babies who didn’t survive. It was really upsetting. Despite everything she went through, Kaylyn is now a healthy six-year-old . ‘Even when she was discharged from hospital after almost four months she was showing no signs of being able to see at all. She had to be seen by an eye doctors for a year. That was one of the biggest worries. ‘Now we are just so grateful she is here and so happy and healthy. She has done so well. It’s amazing.’ Miss Blaikie and Kaylyn’s father, Michael Fry, 38, were originally told she was suffering a miscarriage when she started to bleed at 16 weeks. And for the next seven weeks they were regularly told the pregnancy was not going to last 23 weeks, when there would be a slim chance Kaylyn would be able to thrive outside the womb. But against the odds, at 23 weeks Miss Blaikie, an adult nursing student, was transferred 70 miles from the Borders General Hospital to Newcastle, where Kaylyn arrived three weeks later. Recalling what happened, Miss Blaikie said: ‘I was in the labour ward regularly because of the contraction pains I was getting. But nothing happened. Then when I was in the antenatal ward one day I stood up to go to the toilet and she was basically there. ‘She wasn’t at all where she needed to be and they had to wrap her up in tin-foil and rush her to the resuscitation room. ‘I thought I had lost her. I was really worried because she was blue and floppy and not breathing. But they came back after three hours and told me she was alive and they had managed to get her stable.’ The doctors had to resuscitate the tiny newborn and insert drains in her lungs to give her a fighting chance. Miss . Blaikie said: ‘When we finally got to see her she was really red and . there were loads of tubes, monitors and beeping and every time we heard a . beep I began to panic. ‘We . were told she was getting the maximum amount of treatment she could get . and for the first few days it didn’t look like she was going to make . it.’ Ms Blaikie said: 'Kaylyn was definitely meant to be here. She's a little fighter - literally' But after a week on a ventilator she was well enough to be transferred from Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary to the Simpsons Maternity Unit at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, where she spent the next 15 weeks. Miss Blaikie said: ‘I spent weeks sitting by her incubator. She was so small. I remember her hands were absolutely tiny, but totally perfect. ‘After she was born her weight dropped to 1lb 6oz but by the time we got out of hospital she was 7lb. ‘She had quite a lot of problems until she was about three years old. But now nothing is holding her back. ‘When she first started school I couldn’t believe it. Not just that she had survived, but that she had no disabilities and was able to go. It was really an emotional day. ‘The doctor said he had never actually seen so many factors that resulted in a live birth before. She really is a little miracle.’","Kaylyn Fry wasn't expected to live when the placenta ruptured at 16 weeks .

"Mark Serwotka's blood is pumped around his body by a ventricular assist device . Union leader Mark Serwotka has told how he was left without a pulse after catching a rare virus while out walking his dog. He suffered a mysterious heart failure four years ago, which eventually starved his internal organs of blood. It meant he had to be fitted with a £130,000 battery-powered device strapped to his waist which pumps blood around his body. He is one of between only 140 and 150 people to have one of the gadgets, called a ventricular assist device (Vad). From the pump, a cable runs under his ribs, out of his stomach and into the controller in a bumbag. The 51-year-old head of the Public and Commercial Services union, the biggest civil service union, said in an interview: ‘When I’m watching telly, I plug myself into the mains to charge the batteries. When I’m driving, I use the cigarette lighter.’ Vads have a tube that goes into the main artery, the aorta, and should not be switched off in case this triggers a clot. This means Mr Serwotka and other patients like him fitted with one cannot shower or take a bath. He also avoids taking public transport for fear of getting the cables snagged. He believes he picked up the virus while taking his black labrador, Scampi, for a walk. The dog rolled in something disgusting and the next day ‘my face, my legs, everything had swollen’. His GP initially gave him antihistamines which seemed to do the trick until a week later, when Mr Serwotka suddenly felt his heart ‘going crazy’. He was rushed to hospital where doctors assumed he was having a heart attack as his heartbeat was 220 beats per minute, more than double what that of a normal, resting adult should be. But MRI scans showed heavy scars suggesting the virus from the week before had attacked his internal organs, including his heart. Scroll down for video . Mr Serwotka on a picket line at St Stephen's Gate at the House of Parliament in 2011, the year after he fell ill . His heart muscle was too weak to pump blood around his body so he was fitted with a pacemaker which gives an electric shock if his heart starts beating irregularly, similar to the one fitted to Fabrice Muamba, the former Bolton Wanderers soccer star who collapsed on the pitch two years ago after suffering a cardiac arrest. Mr Serwotka, who lives in Surrey with wife Ruth and their two children, returned to work but his condition worsened dramatically in summer 2013. He told The Guardian: ‘I couldn’t walk 50 yards without being sick. I would retch 20 times a day.’ After being referred to specialist heart centre Papworth Hospital in Cambridge, he was told he needed a heart transplant - but any new organ would fail because his lungs were so ravenous for blood they were exerting huge pressure. Mr Serwotka said: ‘If I didn’t get treatment. I’d have between one and three years. Probably nearer one.’ Doctors decided to fit the Vad, which they hope will ease the pressure from his lungs so he can eventually have a transplant. The device took a six-hour operation to fit involving cutting through his breastbone and bending his ribs. Mr Serwotka, who is now back at home and preparing to return to work this month, said: ‘You can say, ‘S***, I wish I’d never taken the dog out that day.’ You can wonder, ‘Why me?’ ‘But I’m one of those who thinks the glass is half-full, rather than half-empty - even when it’s only a quarter-full.’","Public and Commercial Services Union leader Mark Serwotka fell ill in 2010 .

"Conmen bombarded lonely women on a dating website with gushing messages of love to con them out of £220,000, a court heard yesterday. The group created false profiles on Match.com to pose as middle-aged men and told victims they were their ‘soulmate’ and ‘inspiration’. One woman received a message describing ‘the love thundering into our hearts that only we can understand’. Scroll down for video . On trial: Adewunmi Nusi and Brooke Boston (covered) leave the court, where they are accused of taking advantage of vulnerable women looking for love in return for cash . Scam: The gang are accused of using a fake profiles set up on match.com - mainly with the name James Richards - and then gradually swindled cash from vulnerable women . The gang invented a story about . needing money to ‘free up’ a £1.5million inheritance locked in an Indian . bank account to press the ‘vulnerable’ singletons for cash, prosecutors . said. Monty Emu, 28, . Eberechi Ekpo, 26, Adewunmi Nusi, 37, and Brooke Boston, 28, allegedly . pocketed £220,000 from women they targeted. One woman paid them £174,000 . in total, the court heard. Opening . the trial at Winchester Crown Court, prosecutor Simon Edwards said . bogus Match.com accounts were  set up to contact ‘emotionally . vulnerable’ users. One profile, for ‘James Richards’, described him as ‘very attractive’ and listed his height, build and hair colour. Once . they lured a woman they would exchange messages on the site and then . move to text messages and email, where they were unmonitored, jurors . heard. Victim: Suzanne Hardman sobbed as she told the court that she was duped by the false profile of James Richards into handing over about £170,000 . Manipulation: This email reveals how the women were bombarded with messages where 'James' declared his love for them but also mentioned problems that would be solved by their cash . The victims were . told Mr Richards’ father had died and left him £1.5million. He asked . them for £700 to help fund a trip to India to access it. ‘Mr . Richards’ went on the trip but hit problems and needed more money to . obtain a series of certificates and an affidavit to release his . inheritance, the story went, with the sums ranging from £10,000 to . £100,000. The scam included . a fictitious lawyer, Rod Thompson of ‘Quality Solicitors’, fake court . documents and tax clearance certificates. Mr . Edwards said: ‘The operation of the conspiracy was fairly . straightforward and its success depended on the trust and co-operation . of the victims in this case. ‘It . is fair to say – and I hope I do not do them a disservice in this – by . and large the victims were financially vulnerable and also to an extent . emotionally vulnerable. ‘The . conspirators exploited their emotional vulnerability to ensure . financial reward for them and those who laundered the money.’ Money was paid into bank accounts and transferred on, and cash was withdrawn around Portsmouth, Hampshire, Mr Edwards said. Contact: The men allegedly sent amorous messages via the dating site before moving to email and text to ask for money . Suzanne . Hardman, of  Basingstoke, Hampshire, handed over £174,000 in several . payments after being contacted by ‘James Richards’ in March 2012. She . received messages saying she made him ‘feel like a complete man’ and . another – referred to in court as the ‘thundering email’ – that told of . ‘the love thundering into our hearts that only we can understand’. Mrs . Hardman broke down as she told the court how, having separated from her . husband, she handed over her savings from the sale of her former . marital home. ‘Certain . things just didn’t seem right, but because I was led to believe that I . was dealing with a solicitor it seemed fine, because he was taking care . of the money – or so I thought,’ she said. But not all women contacted fell for the group’s claims, and the scam eventually came unstuck, the court heard. Mr . Edwards said ‘elementary mistakes’ were made, such as a passport . supposedly belonging to James Richards sent as proof giving his name as . Richard James and an affidavit listed £1.5million ‘starling’ rather than . sterling. Boston, Emu and . Ekpo, from Southsea, Hampshire, and Nusi, of Thatcham, Berkshire, deny . money laundering between August 2012 and December 2013. Boston and Ekpo deny committing fraud by false representation from March 1, 2012, and February 9 2014.

"When John Dyson and his wife Faith moved to a sleepy corner of southern France, they were hoping for a peaceful retirement. But within months of settling in the village of Brugairolles, they found themselves embroiled in a bitter feud with their neighbour – another British expatriate – over access to their front door. The French media have dubbed it La Guerre des Britanniques (The War of the Britons) after Forbes Dunlop nailed up the Dysons’ window shutters and blocked their front door with wooden fence posts secured with cement. Scroll down for video . Dispute: 100 villagers ripped down a brick and wooden wall built across this home (right), which belongs to British couple John and Faith Dyson. It was the final chapter in a 10-year row with their neighbours . Mr Dunlop is believed to object to his neighbours being able to look out over ‘his’ driveway. His . fury has prompted him to write to everyone from his local police force . back in Scotland to the  European Court of Human Rights, while one . 85-page epic was even sent to former French president Nicolas Sarkozy. The . latest development saw the Dysons forced to come and go via their back . garden instead of the driveway leading to the pair of stone houses, . which Mr Dunlop, 67, says they have no right to use. Far . from dismissing the row among ‘les rosbifs’ with a Gallic shrug, French . residents of the village – population 258 – have rallied round the . Dysons, with some 60 of them marching on the properties ‘to rescue’ the . couple. Blocked in: John and Faith Dyson bought the property near Toulouse when they retired in 2004 . Enraged: Mr Dunlop sparked outrage in the village of Brugairolles by building a brick wall across the front door . Video courtesy of the DSCV . ‘We . could not accept that they should continue to live under such terror,’ said Jeannot Gach, 83, a retired policeman. ‘We shouted, whistled . against their unscrupulous neighbours.’ South . African-born Mr Dyson, 72, a retired engineer, moved to Brugairolles, . in the foothills of the Pyrenees, with his wife in 2004 from . Storrington, West Sussex. Mr . Dunlop, formerly from Strathclyde, and his wife Krystyna, thought to be . Polish, moved there eight months later – and soon began raising . objections over the Dysons’ windows, which overlook the driveway. Although . access to the driveway was not written into the property’s deeds, . French law guarantees right of way if an entrance has been used . continuously for at least 30 years. The . Dysons have produced a series of affidavits to confirm this is the case . with their house, and a local civil court will now rule on the matter. ‘For the last 150 years, the only access to the house was from that . drive,’ said Mr Dyson. ‘They knew all this before they even bought their house.’ Mr Dunlop has refused to comment, telling one reporter: ‘I am deaf, I cannot hear what you say, I am deaf.'

"The arrival of your first baby is a massive moment for any mother. For Lara Carpenter-Beck, the enormousness of it was all too plain to see. Her baby bump swelled to 55 inches, she piled on 6st 9lb, shot up five dress sizes… and even feared she would be crushed by the weight when she lay on her back. Scroll down for video . Lara gained an astonishing 6 and a half stone whilst pregnant with her first child but lost the entirity of her weight within the first year . ‘At just . 12 weeks people were asking me when I was due – I was that big,’ the . 29-year-old artist said yesterday. ‘And my bump just kept growing and . growing. ‘It was my first pregnancy so I had no idea what to expect but I knew it wasn’t normal to grow at the rate I was.’ Average . weight gain in pregnancy, inclusive of the baby, the fluid around it . and the enlargement of the womb, is between one-and-a-half and two . stone. Mrs . Carpenter-Beck is 5ft7in and a size 12. She was diagnosed with type 1 . diabetes – which occurs when the body fails to produce insulin and is . not linked to obesity – in 2011 a week before marrying property agent . husband Chris, 38. Bumper bump: Lara's partner Chris measures her 55 inch baby bump . Lara says that her bump was so big that people were asking her due date at just 12 weeks . She . knew that diabetes sufferers are prone to gaining weight in pregnancy . but even so was shocked at just how big she became as she was careful . about her portion sizes. At 32 weeks, a nurse told her that her baby . already weighed 6lb – not far off the average weight of a full-term baby . (7lb 6oz for girls) even though she was still eight weeks away from her . due date. ‘It was really hard carrying around all of the weight when I . wasn’t used to it,’ she said. ‘Even . sleeping was a problem and my bump was so big I couldn’t lie on my . front, and when I lay on my back I felt like I was being crushed under . the weight.’ At . 36 weeks she weighed 18st and had to wear size 22 clothes because . normal maternity wear would not fit around her huge bump, which then . measured 55 inches in circumference. When her waters suddenly broke she . was rushed in to hospital for a Caesarean section. She and her husband . were relieved when daughter Savannah was born healthy – at a bouncing . 9lb 5oz. Mrs . Carpenter-Beck, from Bristol, said she worried about regaining her . figure but lost the weight in a year with the help of Slimming World. She shed a stone in the first week after the birth and another in the . second. She added: ‘I couldn’t believe how big I became, but it hasn’t . put me off having another one. It’s all worth it to have a healthy . baby.’ Lara's weight gain meant that baby Savannah was born slightly heavier than the average baby girl at 9lbs 5oz . Lara is delighted to be back to her svelte size 12 figure and is looking forward to hitting the high street . The 29-year-old had to resort to size 22 clothes whilst pregnant to accommodate her large baby bump . Chris and Lara welcomed baby Savannah to the world last year . Lara says that her weight gain during her first pregnancy has not put her off having another child and says the discomfort was entirely worth it .

"A girl of 15 and her Turkish sweetheart ran hand in hand into the path of a high-speed train because they feared his family disapproved of their relationship. Charleigh Disbrey and Mert Karaoglan, 18, had been together only a month but chose to die together rather than be forced apart by ‘cultural issues’. Mert sent a picture message to a friend of the pair on a bridge over the railway line, saying they would ‘never be together in this life and would rather be together in a different place’. Schoolgirl Charleigh Disbrey, 15, had musical ambitions and had auditioned for TV's Britain's Got Talent . Boyfriend Mert Karaoglan, 18, feared his family disapproved of his relationship with Charleigh . They then climbed a 6ft fence to get on to the tracks at the busy Elstree and Borehamwood station in Hertfordshire. The driver of an empty London First Capital Connect train saw them running down the line but was unable to avoid hitting them, an inquest heard yesterday. They died of multiple massive injuries. Graham Danbury, Hertfordshire’s deputy coroner, told the hearing: ‘Because of Mert’s background it seems like a relationship between him and Charleigh would not have been approved by his family. ‘And it seems to me that such was the intensity of their feelings for each other that they ignored the effect that their acts would have on others – their family, their friends and the train driver – and decided that they wanted to be together in death.’ The young lovers attended Hertswood Academy near their Borehamwood homes. Charleigh, who was studying for her GCSEs, had auditioned for the TV shows Britain’s Got Talent and Must Be The Music. She had posted videos of herself on YouTube playing an acoustic guitar and had written on her website that she wanted to become a musician ‘to be remembered’. Loss: Charleigh Disbrey, 15, known as CJ to friends, died alongside 18-year-old Turkish boyfriend Mert Karaoglan in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, on June 17 last year . Mert, who was said to be a talented film-maker and photographer, was studying for his A-levels. The . inquest heard Charleigh had taken overdoses and had expressed suicidal . tendencies in the month leading up to her death on June 17 last year. In . a statement, Mert’s father Sukru Karaoglan, 49, told the inquest: ‘Mert . got up earlier than usual and went straight out to school without . breakfast or speaking to the family. ‘He didn’t get home until after 5 o’clock, got changed and said he was going to meet some friends.’ He . was asked to stay to have a meal with the family and joined them for a . short while before insisting he had to go. ‘That was the last time the . father saw him,’ said Dr Danbury. Mert Karaoglan, a keen photographer, met his girlfriend at Hertswood Academy where they both studied . The coroner said the two appeared 'to have decided that because of cultural and family issues they were not going to be allowed to develop their relationship' Mert’s . friend, Harry Whitlock, told the inquest he had seemed normal at school . that day. At around 7pm he received the picture of the pair on the . bridge and a text moments before they died at around 9pm saying: ‘Find . my phone. Find the video. I love you.’ Dr . Danbury said: ‘In one of these [videos] they give some explanation of . what they are about to do, which was to end their lives and they . referred to family and cultural problems and they felt that they weren’t . going to be able to be together in this life and they would rather be . together in a different place.’ Harry . told the hearing he was at the cinema at the time he received the . messages from Mert and was later told by a friend of the tragic deaths. He said the last picture on the bridge ‘was just them two together, just smiling’. Another . friend, Christopher Walker, said he last saw Mert at 1pm on the day of . his death and was told he would be sent some internet passwords. He . added: ‘He told me he had met his soulmate. I think this meant the girl . I know he had been seeing for the last month. He was happy. He gave me a . big hug, and left.’ Charleigh, known as CJ, also sent a number of texts . before her death saying sorry and telling them she loved them. In . one, she wrote: ‘I have met the most amazing person – he is my life.’ Last night there was no answer at the flat where Mert lived with his . family. Neighbours said they returned to Turkey earlier this year and Mr Karaoglan has made occasional trips back. Dr Danbury recorded verdicts of suicide at the hearing in Hatfield. Talented musician Charleigh had also sent a number of text messages to friends in the hours before her death saying 'sorry' and telling them she loved them .","Charleigh Disbrey, 15, and Mert Karaoglan, 18, ended their lives together .

"Ex-Chelsea and Leeds owner Ken Bates may have helped a young boy's dreams come true after donating £10,000 to pay for life-changing surgery. Leo Stott, who suffers with cerebral palsy and cannot walk unaided, has always wanted to play football without a walking frame. Hundreds of people donated money to pay for him to have a life-changing operation, with Bates pledging a sizeable chunk of the £45,000 needed. Generous: Former Leeds owner Ken Bates donated £10,000 to pay for Leo Stott's life-changing surgery . Determined: Leo Stott, two, who suffers from cerebral palsy, playing football with his walking frame . Leo, two,  loves football and, his coach says, plays just as well as other boys his age. He was desperate to do without his frame, so his family set out to raise £45,000 for a selective dorsal rhizotomy, a surgery not generally available on the NHS. Just 48 hours after his story appeared in last Saturday’s Mail, his mother Cara Oldham had raised more than enough to book Leo’s operation at Leeds Hospital. She thanked all those who gave via www.justgiving.com/leosdreamtowalk, where the family are now taking donations to pay for ongoing care. She said: ‘I am astonished, amazed and humbled that strangers can be so kind.’ Bates, 82, was born with a club foot but went on to play for Arsenal juniors. He phoned Miss Oldham to say he wanted to help. The dental nurse said: ‘I just couldn’t believe it and kept asking him, ‘Are you sure?’ ‘It was so emotional. After I put the phone down I cried, then my mum cried and everyone in the room started crying. It was so moving. It has restored my faith. All I can say is wow. ‘When his father and I sat Leo down and told him we had enough money now he said that was very good because he didn’t want his legs to hurt anymore.’ Leo with his mum, Cara: She wept after putting the phone down to Ken Bates when he pledged the cash . Monaco-based Bates, who is known in the football world for his abrasive style and nicknamed ‘cuddly Ken’, told the Mail it is ‘ridiculous’ the type of surgery Leo needs is not automatically funded on the NHS, especially when breast enlargement and reduction operations are. 'Cuddly': Bates, the former chairman of Chelsea, who played football after being born with a club foot . ‘This little kid deserves all the help he can get,’ he said. ‘Leo has been raised to believe he can do anything and I believe he absolutely can.’ Leo, from Oldham, has been accepted for pioneering surgery at Leeds Hospital. The operation - a selective dorsal rhizotomy (sdr) - was not funded by the NHS when the family began fund-raising earlier this year. The procedure would release tension in his legs, allowing him to undergo more intensive physiotherapy to let him walk unaided. Just weeks ago the NHS announced SDR would be available to a limited number of children in a trial. But with just five hospitals signed up to the pilot scheme to treat 120 children a year, Miss Oldham was warned Leo would face a lengthy wait to learn if he was eligible or not. Miss Oldham, who can now book the operation, thanked ‘every single person’ who donated ‘because they have helped to change my son’s life’. ‘We’ve worked so hard to raise money and had such brilliant support from family and friends, but to see it start to climb so quickly after sharing our story was incredible,’ she said. ‘I am astonished, amazed and humbled that complete strangers can be so kind. Words cannot express the gratitude I feel. The relief I feel knowing my son can now have the operation is the best feeling in the world.’ Leo was diagnosed with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy at 18 months old. But despite being unable to stand or walk unaided he loved watching football with his father Sam Stott, 23, a contract manager. Leo stood for the first time shortly before turning two thanks to a walking frame and was soon dribbling his ball. He attends weekly toddler training sessions at his local club. Miss Oldham said: ‘Nobody could believe how well he could tackle, pass and shoot with his frame. His face lit up with a ball at his feet. But all he really wanted was to be able to play like all his friends without his frame.’ She has now raised their fundraising target to £55,000 to help pay for further care after the operation.

"They have been billed as this year’s Olympic Games, the sporting event that will send a positive message about life beyond disability for servicemen and women wounded on the front line. But while the world awaits the lavish opening ceremony of the first Invictus Games on Wednesday, organiser Prince Harry has spoken for the first time about how difficult it has been to put on the Paralympics-style event. In an hour-long documentary tomorrow night, he reveals that staging the Games had been much harder than he had anticipated. Scroll down for video . In an hour-long documentary, Prince Harry reveals that staging the Invictus Games had been much harder than he had anticipated . ‘It’s been a real wake-up call for me,’ the Prince said. ‘Me and my big mouth, saying we’re going to fill the Olympic Stadium, we’re going to do this, do that. ‘In my head it seemed very, very easy. In reality it’s been a real struggle.’ The Games will see more than 400 wounded, injured and sick servicemen and women compete across several sporting disciplines, including wheelchair rugby and athletics. Thirteen nations, including Afghanistan, will compete at the tournament, which takes place at some of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games venues. At the opening ceremony, Coldplay’s Chris Martin will perform the official Games anthem and there will be a flypast by the Red Arrows. The star-studded closing ceremony on September 14 will see performances from acts including Foo Fighters, James Blunt and the Military Wives Choir. Thousands of £12.85 tickets have been sold and some events are sold out. But the 29-year-old Prince remains nervous. Prince Harry said: ‘In my head it seemed very, very easy. In reality it’s been a real struggle' ‘Oh, of course I’m nervous,’ he said. ‘There are times when we thought that we’re just never, ever going to get to the finish line. If all the venues sell out, then I’m happy because it’s all about the atmosphere and making these guys feel really special. 'All they want to do is make sure they’re fit enough and ready to put on a show for the public who have been constantly giving money to Help for Heroes and the other Service Charities. People are coming because they want to show their appreciation,’ Harry said. The Prince admitted the idea was ‘stolen’ from America’s Warrior Games, a similar event for injured US soldiers, now in its fourth year. However, he first considered the idea after his first tour of Afghanistan in 2008. He recalled: ‘I came back on a plane with three wounded guys all in induced comas. I think a Danish soldier died, so his coffin was underneath us. That for me was where it all started,’ he said. The name ‘Invictus’ – Latin for ‘unconquered’ – was inspired by William Ernest Henley’s classic poem of the same name, which tells of strength during times of adversity. Countdown To The Invictus Games, BBC2, 9.15pm, Sunday . Iraq has turned down the offer to compete at the  event due partly to the ongoing conflict in the ravaged country. There . is speculation that  the war-torn country has decided not to send a . team  for fear that its athletes  will be a target for those angered by . the atrocities carried out in the region by Islamic State militants. But . Jackie Brock-Doyle, a spokesman for the Invictus Games, insists this . was not  the case. She said: ‘It has  just not been possible for  Iraq . to put together a team of competitors in the time available and with the . other pressures currently on the military in Iraq.’ Countries had five months  to prepare teams after organisation for the Games began in February. Ms . Brock-Doyle added: ‘Help For Heroes has been behind putting the British . team together and has been so supportive. Not every country invited to . compete at Invictus may have an organisation like that to help out.’ Iraq . will show support for the event by sending a small delegation of . observers. Organisers hope the country will take part in future events. My journey from battlefield to sports field: Army captain on how he's helping run the Invictus Games after being shot by the Taliban in 2009 . David Wiseman, 31, served as a captain with The Yorkshire Regiment in Iraq and Afghanistan, where he commanded a team of British soldiers embedded with Afghan forces deep in central Helmand province’s Nad-e Ali district. In 2009 he was shot by the Taliban, suffering extensive chest wounds. He was medically discharged from the Army last year and is now helping to run the Invictus Games, as well as competing in them. It was the moment in which my life changed for ever. Without warning, the quiet of the morning was shattered by the sound of automatic fire opening up on my patrol in Helmand. I didn’t know how many of them there were, so I inched forward to get a better fix on the situation. The first round was so close I felt it whistle past my head; the second floored me. I had no time to react. It smashed into my shoulder like a sledgehammer, pulverising bone and tissue. It travelled through my chest, snapping my ribs like matchsticks and lacerating a lung. I was picked up by the force and flung several metres through the air, spinning like a rag doll. Survival instinct kicked in, and I slithered into the ditch by the side of the road for cover. In the fetid water I began to gasp for breath. Dust, air and ditch water sucked in through the angry hole in my shoulder as I tried to inhale. The pain was indescribable. David Wiseman, 31, is helping to run the Invictus Games after being shot by the Taliban in 2009 . I knew my injuries were serious and that I needed to get to the hospital in Camp Bastion. ‘And yea though I walk through the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil.’ My medic Manny’s voice filled my ears. ‘Damn, I am in the s***,’ I thought. He’s reciting the Psalms.’ The sounds of battle were becoming distant. ‘This is it; this is how I end,’ I told myself. Instead, it was a beginning of sorts. After an operation at Camp Bastion, I was flown to Selly Oak Hospital. My battle back to health was slow. In July 2013, dressed in my uniform for what would be one of the last times, I listened as doctors recommended that, on physical and psychological grounds, service in the Army was unsuitable for me. My time in the Army was over. I was expecting the decision, however, it still felt like someone had punched me in the stomach. Over the preceding year there had been a fundamental shift in the way I viewed myself. I’d only ever been in the Army; it was what defined me. But, post injury, I could only think of myself as something I used to be: an ex-soldier, wounded soldier, broken. Now I have been honoured to play a role in running and taking part in the inaugural Invictus Games. These are men and women who have served and fought together. They bonded on the battlefield: now they’ll bond on the sports field. The bullet remains embedded deep in my chest, and I will carry it with me for life. It is part of who I am and a permanent reminder of the fragility of life and how things can change in an instant. lHelmand To The Himalayas: One Soldier’s Inspirational Journey, by David Wiseman, is available now, priced at £8.99.","Prince Harry said staging the Games has been harder than he anticipated .

Explanation: U.S.-based Wikimedia, which owns Wikipedia, states on its site: 'This file is in the public domain because as the work of a non-human animal, it has no human author in whom copyright is vested' Today, Mr Slater said Wikimedia’s decision to include his image . in its database had affected his livelihood and resulted in a . loss of earnings. 'It’s all based on a technicality. I own the photo but because . the monkey pressed the trigger and took the photo, they’re claiming the . monkey owns the copyright,' he said. 'There’s . a lot more to copyright than who pushes the trigger on the camera. I . set up the shot, I was behind all the components in taking that image. 'The . problem is they’re telling people it’s free to use because it’s in the . public domain, they even have a link for people to download the . high-res, so they’re actively encouraging people to use it however they . like.' Available to download: The famous monkey selfie is accessible on the Wikimedia Commons site (pictured), which features a collection of 22,302,592 images and video files that are free to use by anyone online . Mr Slater, whose encounter with the macaques happened in 2011, could sue the company for statutory damages of up to $30,000 (£17,824). 'I’ve lost tens-of-thousands of pounds and I have every right to sue them for a loss of earnings,' he said. 'I’ve contacted a lawyer in the U.S. who is willing to take on the case they’re just waiting for my go ahead. 'Nothing . gives Wikimedia the right to decide who owns the copyright of the image . and give people permission to use it for free, no court has decided . that. Trapped: In this photo taken by Mr Slater during his trip, a macaque is trapped in a snare. It was then rescued . 'They don’t know the . story behind the image.

It has also previously appeared on websites, newspapers, magazines and television shows around the world. At the height of its fame, Mr Slater said of the macaques: 'They were quite . mischievous jumping all over my equipment, and it looked like they were . already posing for the camera when one hit the button. 'The . sound got his attention and he kept pressing it. At first it scared the . rest of them away but they soon came back - it was amazing to watch.

"As they bound around in a blur of fur and gleaming teeth, it’s impossible to tell one dog from the other. But when owner Ashleigh Butler instructs them to start dancing and prancing, it’s rather easier to see who’s the professional canine entertainer who won Britain’s Got Talent – and who needs to work on his quick-step. ‘Sullivan!’ Ashleigh shrieks as the hapless puppy springs around like a jack-in-the-box. ‘Listen! Concentrate please. No, you doughnut. Sullivan! Arghhh. As you can see he’s got a long way to go before he’s anywhere near Pudsey.’ Teaching a new dog, old tricks: Ashleigh poses with Pudsey on her back and Sully beneath . Sullivan, or Sully, or The Closet Monster of Ashpen to use his official name, is set to be the new Pudsey. There is even talk of them becoming the first ever doggy double act. Ashleigh bought Sully 18 months ago from a family friend when he was just a week old and ever since she has been training him in case performing becomes too much for Pudsey. But she believes her star pupil, and beloved pet, has ‘got a few years left in him yet’. Until then, Sully is strictly just a part of Team Pudsey. He accompanies him on most big acting jobs to be his playmate and ‘stress reliever’. It's a disco inferno: Sully and Pudsey practise the sort of carefully choreographed dances moves . He was recently on hand in Pudsey’s trailer on set of Pudsey The Dog: The Movie, which premieres next week. And come December the puppy protege will play the understudy – or should that be underdog – when Pudsey stars with Ashleigh in the panto Dick Whittington in Bristol. ‘Sully will be there,’ Ashleigh confirms. ‘If anything happened to Pudsey – say he became ill one day – then I’d have to go on with Sully. Pudsey takes the lead and shows Sully how he wowed Simon in Britain's Got Talent . 'He’s done a lot more performing this year and he’s getting better. Sully thinks he’s the next top dog. He tries to push Pudsey out of the way when they’re together.’ The Mail on Sunday has been granted an exclusive audience with the canine pair. It is Sully’s first ever public performance and the first time Ashleigh has attempted to make them perform together. He may be a bit rough around the edges, but at just 17 months old Sully can prance on his hind legs, pirouette, wave, hide and beg, just  like Pudsey. At one point both dogs stand masterfully with their paws on Ashleigh’s shoulders. Sully can even do things his friend can not. He can reverse around Ashleigh and walk backwards like a pro. ‘Sully does look to Pudsey to help him out with the trickier moves,’ Ashleigh reveals. ‘He watched Pudsey walking on his back legs and thought, “Hmm I could give that a go” and just did it. ‘This is the first time I’ve put them together. It’s difficult with two, but perhaps they could be a double act. I could do a routine to Anything You Can Do because they do try to outdo each other.’ Pudsey will be ten next year, but retirement looks a long way off. He looks fitter than ever, perhaps because he has his own doggy treadmill. ‘It keeps his muscles strong,’ Ashleigh says. ‘He wouldn’t be able to stand on his back legs for so long if he wasn’t fit. He’s an athlete. When Pudsey wants to retire, he’ll let us know.’ Like Pudsey, Sully is a Chinese Crested powderpuff and Border Collie cross, but has a smattering of poodle instead of Bichon Frise. Ashleigh Butler and Pudsey: She is training Sully to do the same tricks as star dog Pudsey . He is named after Sully from the Disney film Monsters Inc because of his blue merle colouring – ‘and he’s a little monster’. ‘He’s probably one of the naughtiest puppies I have ever known,’ Ashleigh says. ‘He steals my dirty socks. He’s quite a weird dog. He used to dig up mum’s plants and run around shaking them like a trophy.’ He has also been known to terrorise mum’s prize-winning show guinea pigs which, before Sully had his way, were allowed to roam in the family’s garden in Wellingborough. ‘Sully caught a couple and decided to de-hair them,’ Ashleigh says. ‘It took six months for their fur to grow back.’ Star in the making: If anything happens to Pudsey, Ashleigh says Sully will take over . Sully’s arrival did not go down well. ‘Pudsey wasn’t impressed,’ Ashleigh says. ‘For two weeks he blanked him entirely. When he realised he wasn’t leaving he gave up and played with him instead. Now they’re like brothers; they’re inseparable.’ Ashleigh herself has blossomed from a shy 16-year-old on Britain’s Got Talent to a 19-year-old brimming with confidence and grand plans. She admits to not doing very well in her AS level exams last year, but says dog dancing is her career now. With more than £1 million in the bank thanks to her BGT winnings, a book and calendar deal, many, many appearances and, of course the movie, one can forgive her for feeling unfazed by her lack of educational success. Puparazzi shots: The canine stars check how they look on Mail On Sunday photographer Lee Wilson's camera . She wasn’t in Pudsey: The Movie, bar a few shots of her in the crowd, but seems resigned to playing second fiddle to her beloved pooch. ‘I’m not envious of my dogs,’ she says. ‘I won Britain’s Got Talent because of my dog and Pudsey is a lot cuter than I am. But I’d like to move forward without my dogs. I’d like to get into presenting one day.’ But right now, she has her work cut out with naughty Sully. ‘This morning we got home to find the police at our door,’ Ashleigh says. ‘The dogs had got out of their room and set the burglar alarm off. I must say Sully looked very sheepish. I’m sure he was the culprit.’","Ashleigh Butler won Britain's Got Talent with her performing dog Pudsey .

"Her very name encapsulated the stick-thin fashion ideals of the Swinging Sixties. Now, at 64, Twiggy is no longer the willowy size six waif who ‘ate like a horse’ and never gained weight – but instead a more shapely eight-and-a-half stone size ten. And she even admits occasionally dieting and wearing support knickers under tight dresses . Although she still looks fabulous, the news that even international supermodels are not immune to filling out will be music to the ears of the vast majority of women who don’t have catwalk figures. But it is also the secret weapon that Marks and Spencer hopes can turn round their flagging fortunes on the high street. 'The monochrome trend is big for summer and ideal for a grown-up Mod like me! Try it for the office or a smart garden party': Colour Block Shift Dress, £49.50. Leather Stiletto Peep Toe Court Shoes, £49.50 . 'This Sixties Inspired swing dress is perfect for Summer weddings... and certainly sparks fond memories for me': Swing shift dress, £59, Leather T-Bar Sandals, £45 . When the Sixties style icon came out of modelling retirement a decade ago in an acclaimed advertising campaign for M&S, there was an instant ‘Twiggy Effect’ – and the clothes she wore walked off the shelves, helping to boost the share price to its highest point in eight years. Now her own online-only fashion collection is proving a bestseller for the store – a rare bright spot for the company which last week reported a dip in profits for the third year running, a problem exacerbated by a general slump in fashion sales. The secret of her success is that the effects of time have given Twiggy a heightened appreciation of the fashion needs of ordinary women – which can be seen in the designs of her new summer collection, available online today. In an exclusive preview for The Mail on Sunday, she reveals how she is determined to design for women who never knew what it was to be a ‘twiglet’. Indeed, her new M&S collection goes from a size eight to a size 22. ‘I think that’s only right,’ she says. ‘There are big people out there and they have to be able to buy clothes. 'A real shape shifter... this is amazing for creating hour-glass curves, even on a twiglet!': Sleeveless Shift dress, £59, Suede Peep Toe Court Shoes, £49.50 . 'This hot fuchsia dress with pretty lace sleeves will make you look a stunner from daytime until midnight at a summer wedding, and its secret weapon is its secret slimming panel': Lace dress, £59, Suede Mid Heel T-Bar Sandals, £45 . 'You¿ll love the way this skirt swishes, it feels so free, and my gorgeous silky T-shirts genuinely go with everything - dress them up or down': Short Sleeve T-Shirt £19.50, Flippy Skirt, £45, Suede Peep Toe Court Shoes, £49.50, Faux Snakeskin Cross-Body Bag, £35 . 'I rely on LBDs as much as the next woman, and mine is a must-have with its flattering vertical pleat': Swing Shift Dress, £59, Colour Block Shoulder Bag, £29.50, Suede Mid Heel T-Bar Sandals, £45 . ‘I do think that if you’re that size you should look at your diet but these people still have to buy clothes and shouldn’t be left out. ‘Also, it’s Marks’ policy to do that size. It’s not fair when you go into a shop and the sizes only go up to a UK 14.’ While the rest of the high street is littered with sleeveless frocks that require the toned biceps of Michelle Obama, Twiggy has made sure nearly all of her designs have sleeves. Much more flattering for Ms Average. Her fuchsia number with long, lace sleeves will be particularly popular for summer weddings. Moreover her range of sensibly hued T-shirts have sleeves that come nearly down to the elbow – a neat solution for those of us afflicted by bingo-wings. Twiggy admits that in years gone by M&S’s women’s offering was ‘a bit mummish’ but insists it is now ‘brilliant’ and ‘so good for the price’. She won’t reveal her own sales figures but says the line continues to do very well, ‘touch wood’. ‘We did a blue suede biker jacket for spring which sold out within two days. Little did we know we could have ordered ten times the amount,’ she says. ‘We’ve had a sequined jacket that has been in most of the collections in different colours. You can wear it at any age. I never put an age on my clothes and always say the range is from 18 to 80.’ When we meet, her still-fabulous legs are encased in her own Twiggy For M&S Collection black jeggings – a cross between leggings and jeans. But instead of the on-trend low-cut style, they are cut over the waist, which serves to keep her ever-so-slight muffin top expertly hidden. ‘They’re not bloody hipsters so they don’t dig in,’ Twiggy admits candidly. ‘Even when I was skinny, I hated hipsters: they cut into my hip bone and were really painful. I want clothes that help, that are easy, not precious.’ Her autumn collection will also feature the same very tight, very hot pink dress that she wore to her 35-year-old daughter Carly’s wedding last year. She confirms with a laugh that she went on the ‘fabulous’ 5.2 diet – in which you eat normally for five days and then for two days restrict yourself to 500 calories – in order to look her best in it - the dress also has a secret support lining which really helped! 'I might have been known for the miniskirt, but I have fallen in love with sophisticated maxis. Mine has a hankerchief hem that keeps it youthful': Longline T-Shirt £19.50, Textured Maxi Skirt £45, Suede Mid Heel T-Bar Sandals £45 . 'This classic Sixties number is brilliant for cocktails, dancing and is extremely flattering around the middle': Sequin Embellished Shift Dress £59, Suede Peep Toe Court Shoes, £49.50 . ‘The 5:2 is so doable because you eat, you don’t starve,’ Twiggy says. ‘I lost about 8lb in the end.’ And the support pants which many see as a garment of torture? ‘Oh yes, I’ve got a mixture. They’re so comfortable actually,’ she says. ‘I’ve had to wear old fashioned corsets for period dramas before. They’re really good for your diet because if you eat a big meal and then have to get into a corset it’s agony.’ Her admission that she now has to watch her figure carefully is a far cry from the accusations of promoting anorexia she endured when she was first discovered at 16 in 1966. ‘I did look different, like an alien being and was ever so thin, but I made it very clear that I wasn’t anorexic and that I ate and ate and nothing happened,’ she says. ‘Of course that changes when you get older. I’m much more careful about what I eat now. But I’m lucky because I like healthy food. ‘Potatoes and bread are my downfall, though. I can’t give up really good bread. You know that crusty bread they bring you in restaurants? Oh. My. God. They always bring it when you’re waiting for your food and you’re starving so you fill your face with it.’ But Twiggy is also shocked by how much larger people are today. ‘The average size now is UK 14/16 whereas when I was younger it was 12/14,’ she says seriously. ‘You want to go to Disneyland. I’ve never seen such big bottoms in my life. It’s terrifying,’ she says. ‘I find it upsetting because those people are probably not going to make it, yet they still walk along eating cream cakes and doughnuts and ice creams and drinking huge buckets of Coca-Cola. ‘And what happens in America usually happens here too. The rise in obesity is really sad. There are so many fast food places that are cheap and easy. ‘When I was growing up in the 1950s we weren’t rich by any stretch of the imagination, but mum used to go to the shops every second day and buy fresh produce from the greengrocers and we ate what was in season. Of course, occasionally we all eat something rubbish, but I do try not to.’ When it comes to design, she is much more strict. ‘I am a perfectionist about it and am also very bossy, but we laugh a lot. ‘After the first fitting we laughed or occasionally screamed and have thrown an item out - we then tweaked and pinned until the quality and fabric is perfect.' ‘It’s serious stuff, but fashion should be fun. I’ve got to an age where if something doesn’t have a fun element I don’t see the point in doing it. Life’s too short.’ It’s easy to see why M&S are redeploying their most effective weapon. But can the Twiggy Effect again revive the company’s fortunes?","Fashion icon Twiggy has designed a new collection for Marks & Spencer .

"When Naomi Broady walks  out at Wimbledon tomorrow as one of three home-grown female wildcards, she will carry the unwanted and, she says, unmerited reputation of being the wild child of British tennis. The former under-18 UK  girls’ champion remains fiercely unrepentant about what she claims was an innocent girls’ night out seven years ago that almost ruined her career  and triggered a devastating family row. The scandal was caused when she posted a photo of herself on a social networking site posing provocatively in a minidress next to a condom machine in a toilet. Tennis' former wild child: Naomi Broady, 24, claims the photo of her posing next to a condom machine on a night out seven years ago (right) has ruined her career . It caught the attention of the press and sparked the wrath of the Lawn Tennis Association, which promptly stripped her of her funding, throwing the future of her career in jeopardy. Similar action was taken against another player, David Rice, who shared a picture of himself surrounded by pizza boxes. Miss Broady says the scandal has made her tennis career a struggle ever since. Unlike her rivals, she has no coach and travels alone to tournaments. Speaking for the first time about the incident, Miss Broady, now 24, said: ‘I don’t know why it was such a big deal. I wasn’t drunk and I wasn’t doing drugs either. I was trying to live, for a few nights at least, as a normal 17-year-old. It was blown out of all proportion. ‘I was disgusted with how the LTA handled things. They warned me the picture would be appearing in the next day’s newspapers, but I heard nothing after that. Frustration: The former junior champion chose to boycott LTA funding over their dealing of the situation . ‘We were given no press training and no support. David and I were thrown to the lions while they protected their reputation. We were used as an example but we were just children. ‘It didn’t happen during a tournament and it wasn’t in a training block. Tell me any 17-year-old who doesn’t have a beer once in a  while? If it had been affecting my tennis, then fair enough, but it wasn’t. Now I’m tarnished with this bad girl reputation.’ Miss Broady’s father Simon, a property developer, was so appalled by the LTA’s decision that he pulled Naomi’s equally promising younger brother  Liam, then 13, out of the LTA programme. He then sold the family home to fund their  careers himself. When the LTA offered Miss Broady funding again the following year, it was turned down on principle. The family continued its boycott until last year when Liam, now on the men’s circuit, decided to accept LTA funding again – a move that has angered his father to the point where they are no longer on speaking terms. Miss Broady said: ‘It’s a very touchy subject. Dad says he was trying to protect us, but now Liam is older and has to pay for tennis himself. It’s a difficult family issue. I try to stay out of it.’ But she insists she will not follow her brother’s example. ‘I don’t want their money and now  I have the prize money from Wimbledon I don’t need it,’ she said. ‘I won’t be bought by them after everything that’s happened. ‘I still to this day don’t understand what we did wrong.  If I want to have a night out then I will. If it’s going to affect my tennis, then I won’t do it because tennis is my priority. ‘The LTA certainly weren’t trying to protect me. The LTA only wanted what was best for them.’ A spokesman for the LTA said: ‘We have moved on and are glad that Naomi is doing well on court. We wish her the very best.’","Naomi Broady claims the picture taken on a night out was 'innocent'

"He bought Tracey Emin’s knicker-strewn bed and Damien Hirst’s pickled shark. But will millionaire art collector Charles Saatchi have the same appetite for an emerging painting genre: ‘throttle art’? Seven paintings depicting the infamous moment last year when Mr Saatchi was caught apparently throttling then wife Nigella Lawson are available via his own art sale website. One of the images available on the website is called Saatchi & Saatchi, pictured, by Darren Udaiyan and is available for £5,870 . SaatchiArt.com, which is closely connected to his London gallery, shows one such painting available for $30,000 (£17,600). Little-known artists have also uploaded their depictions of the assault. Mr Saatchi stands to gain from the sale of the works, as he is a minority shareholder in Saatchi Art – a fact that angers anti-violence campaigners. It is just over a year since the 71-year-old was photographed with his hands around Ms Lawson’s throat as they dined at Scott’s in Mayfair, London. Mr Saatchi subsequently accepted a police caution for the incident. The photograph caused a sensation and led to the couple’s acrimonious divorce last November. But Mr Saatchi is seemingly unfazed by the paintings. In an email to The Mail on Sunday, he said: ‘Would it have been a better story if I had censored artists whose work might be personally disobliging?’ When asked if he thought ‘throttle art’ might be a new genre destined to take off, he added: ‘There are 40,000 artists who showcase their work on the site, so I think it’s a bit of a micro genre.’ A painting on the website called Last Course, by Pete Jones, is pictured left, while another version of the scene in Mayfair was painted by Jane Kelly and called Art Collector Throttling A Cook, right -  available for £1,170 . But Polly Neate, chief executive of Women’s Aid, said: ‘Domestic violence is not a trivial matter. It is extremely insensitive to all victims of domestic violence for someone who has accepted a police  caution for assaulting a partner to earn commission on images of the offence. We are shocked that anyone would want to make a profit from images of abuse.’ Darren Udaiyan, 41, a member of the Stuckist movement, uploaded his Van Gogh-style painting of the infamous scene to Saatchi Art after seeing the pictures in a newspaper. It is on sale for $10,000 (£5,870). He said: ‘It’s not really controversial. Saatchi is strangling Nigella but it’s also about him squeezing the art market. It works on many levels. It’s a comment on the art market and how people control it.’ And Pete Jones, 52, decided  to list two paintings depicting the photograph. Last Course is a portrait of Ms Lawson with hands on her throat painted on a bread board. He is also selling Domestic Irony One, an oil painting, for $30,000 (£17,600). ‘When those pictures hit the newspapers that photo said, “Come and paint me,” ’ Mr Jones said. ‘It’s not the best execution, but that’s not what’s important. It’s ironic that this picture is for sale as art and there’s Mr Saatchi lining his pockets from it. He’s profiting from that image.’ A drawing called Charles Saatchi Vs Nigella Lawson is also on the website with an asking price of £150 . Jane Kelly, 58, listed her oil painting last June. ‘I was surprised it stayed up there,’ she said. ‘I’m sure Saatchi doesn’t want a picture of him throttling his wife on his own website. I put it on there to have a laugh  at Saatchi.’ She sold Art Collector Throttling A Cook, advertised for £2,000 (£1,170), to Irish collector and retired EU Commission official Charles Copeland. He also bought her controversial painting of Myra Hindley several years ago. ‘He’s got both Nigella being throttled and Myra in his living room,’ Ms Kelly said. Anyone can create an account on the online gallery and start selling their work from $100 to $30,000. If it sells, the user receives 70 per cent while Saatchi Art takes a 30 per cent commission. The website states that users must not upload anything that is ‘defamatory’ or ‘offensive’ or that is ‘violent  or threatening or promotes violence’. But so far none of the works has been taken down. When asked why the works depicting violence were not removed, Rebecca Wilson, chief curator at the online gallery, said: ‘Saatchi Art does not believe in censorship unless the material is pornographic or incites racial hatred.’","Paintings show moment Charles Saatchi was apparently caught throttling Nigella Lawson .

"'Bunny-boiler' Alex Forrest - played by Glenn Close in the 1987 blockbuster . She is one of Hollywood’s most notorious female characters – a ‘crazed harpy’ who boils her  ex-lover’s family rabbit after he ditches her to return to his wife after a weekend affair. But the creator of Fatal Attraction’s Alex Forrest – played by Glenn Close in the 1987 blockbuster – says the character will  be seen in a far more sympathetic light when a stage adaptation of the story opens in London’s West End later this month. Screenwriter James Dearden said he regarded it as a ‘dubious honour’ that the phrase ‘bunny-boiler’ had entered the English language as slang for an unhinged woman – and claimed he was forced to rewrite the character after pressure from studio bosses. His original plan was for the unfortunate rabbit to be grilled on a rotisserie, but added: ‘Somehow I don’t think bunny broiler has quite the same ring!’ Dearden sees the stage version ‘as an opportunity to redress some of the wrongs we may, however unintentionally, have done to Alex’. He said: ‘I am not going to claim that she is suddenly Miss Normal, nor am I suggesting that dear little floppy-eared creatures are no longer an endangered species, but I can reveal that they will not be scraping Alex off the bathroom tiles at the end of the play. ‘Alex is emphatically not a monster – she is a sad, tragic, lonely woman, holding down a tough job in  a tough, unforgiving city.’ Dearden explained why Alex’s character was changed and how his original story was warped into an attack on feminism and single, career women. He said: ‘Hollywood likes its leading men heroic, so gradually Michael Douglas’s character Dan is made more blameless while Alex turns more and more into the villain. ‘The film was seen by the studio as a parable about AIDS, a critique of the permissive society or an attack on feminism in general and single, career women – all of which could not have been further from my mind.’ Natascha McElhone as a 'toned down' Alex in the upcoming West End production . He said Close was initially reluctant to take on the changes to Alex’s character and that the cast of the forthcoming play – which features English actress Natascha McElhone as Alex  – needed convincing that it would not follow the film’s moral outlook. He said: ‘When Natascha agreed to play Alex on stage for this production it was on the strict understanding – which we are more than happy to give – that this time around Alex will not  be demonised.’ The play also stars English actor Mark Bazeley as Dan and Kristin Davis as his wife. lFatal Attraction opens at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket,  on March 25.","Fatal Attraction's Alex Forrest memorably played by Glenn Close in film .

"Covered in blood and mud and clad in a bulky suit of armour with heavy chainmail protecting his head, there’s nothing measly about Ron Weasley’s new role. Rupert Grint, who played Harry Potter’s Hogwarts pal, looks unrecognisable in these exclusive pictures taken on the set of his new film Enemy Of Man – an adaptation of Shakespeare’s Macbeth. Rupert plays Ross, a Scottish nobleman and friend of Macbeth. In Shakespeare’s play, Ross is a minor character who serves as a messenger to the major players. But if these pictures are anything to go  by, the manly 25-year-old’s role  looks more robust. Rupert Grint, who played Ron Weasley in the Harry Potter films, is Ross, a Scottish nobleman, in Enemy of Man . From Ron to Ross: Grint started working on the Harry Potter films in 2000 when he was 12 years old . In one shot we see Rupert riding into battle atop a black steed,  while another sees him caked in mud and blood against a background of flames. It’s a far cry from his magical adventures in the Potter films. Rupert began playing Ron – opposite Daniel Radcliffe as Harry and Emma Watson as Hermione – in 2000 when he was just 12 and went on to star in all eight films. He is worth a reported £24million thanks to the Potter franchise and an expanding property portfolio. Enemy Of Man is due out next year, and Rupert is currently filming on location in Britain. Enemy of Man, directed by Vincent Regan, stars Sean Bean as Macbeth . Charles Dance plays Duncan in the film, an adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth . The film’s director Vincent Regan – best known for his acting roles  in the movies 300 and Troy – said he wanted to make a film that Shakespeare would have made had he been alive. Regan, who also wrote the screenplay, said he was ‘stripping back  the dialogue and cranking up the action for the timeless tale of war, regicide, betrayal and ultimately revenge’. The film also stars Charles Dance as Duncan and Sean Bean as Macbeth. The role of Lady Macbeth is still to be cast.  It is a running joke among Bean’s fans that the 54-year-old actor  dies in nearly every role he takes  – most recently losing his head  as Eddard Stark in the hit TV series Game Of Thrones, which also stars Dance. And as he is playing Macbeth, it’s not looking good for Sean in this film either...","Rupert Grint plays Ross, a Scottish nobleman, in Enemy of Man .

"What a difference a year makes. As he claps and toddles happily, few would suspect that little Dennie Dolan almost lost a finger when he was attacked in his home by a fox just a year ago. Dennie was just five weeks old, when the urban fox sneaked inside, dragged him off a sofa and tried to pull him out of the house. He was saved when his mother Hayley Cawley heard his screams and frantically followed a trail of blood to find the animal trying to drag him out through the front door. Hayley kicked out repeatedly until the fox released her son and ran away, never to be found. Healing process: Dennie's hand now after a plastic surgeon reattached his finger in a five-hour operation after he was attacked by a fox at just five-weeks-old . Amazingly, Dennie – then just 10lb – has grown into an active and mischievous toddler, blissfully unaware of how close he came to death. Nor does he know he owes the use of his tiny hand to the skill of surgeons who performed an emergency five-hour operation to save his finger. Today, the only clue to his ordeal are two tiny scars on his hand. Hayley, 29, said: ‘Dennie is my little miracle boy. I can’t count the number of times each day I think about how blessed we’ve been. ‘He’s lively and charming with . sparkling blue eyes. But his birthday brought up a lot of emotions. It . was hard not to be reminded of how close we came to losing him.’ Hayley . shivered as she recalled the day in February when she put her infant . son on the settee and went upstairs. Moments later, she heard him cry . out and dashed down to soothe him – only to find he was no longer on the . sofa. Operation: Dennie in hospital after the fox pulled him off a sofa and tried to drag him outside . 'Hero': Dennie with mum Hayley, dad Paul and siblings Ellouise, 10, and Lee, six . In . a panic, Hayley spotted her baby’s blood and then the fox – with . Dennie’s arm in its mouth – moving towards the front porch of their home . in Bromley, South London. Dennie had gashes, weals and bruises on his . head and was bleeding heavily from his hand. ‘Dennie’s finger was literally dangling backwards on to the back of his hand,’ she added. ‘The . fox had not cut through the bone but there seemed to be very little . skin – or anything else – left keeping the finger attached to his hand. I . couldn’t look at it so I covered his hand up with his jumper until . paramedics came. The Mail on Sunday's report of the attack . ‘It was the most horrible experience of my life. ‘I still have nightmares about it and to this day I can’t let Dennie out my sight. He even sleeps in my bedroom in a cot so I can be nearby at all times. ‘If that fox had been able to get him through the door, we might not have seen him again. People would have suspected that I’d killed him.’ Dennie was rushed to the Evelina Children’s Hospital in South London, where plastic surgeon Jian Farhadi and his team operated to re-attach the third finger on his left hand. Hayley said: ‘For several days afterwards the finger was black. ‘We . spent a week in hospital and were delighted when we started to see the . colour coming back into Dennie’s finger. When the bandages came off in . May, his finger was working perfectly. ‘For . Dennie, it was like nothing had happened. He was waving his hands . around and not long after that he was using them to crawl. ‘He’s . regained all feeling. The only reminder we have is the scar at the base . of his finger and some scarring above his wrist from a fox bite. An urban fox pictured on a nearby road to Dolan family home shortly after Dennie was attacked . ‘All the marks on his head have healed, but Dennie has a lot of trouble sleeping on his own. He screams if I leave him in his bedroom and will cry even if leave him in his pushchair. I do wonder if the attack has left him scared of being alone.’ Hayley believes the fox got into their home after her fiance Paul Dolan, 28, went out to collect their other children, Ellouise, ten, and Lee, six, without checking whether the door was closed correctly. ‘We felt so responsible for what had happened as parents,’ she said. ‘I don’t think that will ever go away, but we realise now that it was a freak accident. ‘We don’t even blame the fox – it was an animal doing what animals do. As for Dennie, he’s my little hero. He’s 23lb and is very strong. He keeps me on my toes all day – but I wouldn’t have it any other way.’","Dennie Dolan was just five-weeks-old when he was attacked by the fox .

"There’s a brave flash of red lipstick and a touch of blusher for the occasion, but no amount of make-up can disguise the pain on Nilam Hindocha’s face. Her world is in ruins. It is three years since her beautiful daughter Anni Dewani was kidnapped and shot dead in South Africa on her honeymoon, a murder so compelling in its terrible details. Few cases have been more exhaustively examined, to the continuing distress of the Hindochas. And this is what has driven Nilam to defy the effects of a long battle with cancer and make a painful journey from her home in Sweden to London, where Anni’s British bridegroom Shrien Dewani is fighting extradition, accused of arranging her murder. Scroll down for video . Stress: Grieving Nilam Hindocha says she feels sorry for her son-in-law who is suspected of arranging the murder of her daughter Anni . Nilam, 62, is giving her first account of her family’s ordeal because she is driven by a desperate need to know what really happened to her daughter. Without the answer, she says, a corrosive mix of sorrow and suspicion will surely kill her too. It is all the more remarkable, then, that she can sympathise with the plight of the chief suspect, who remains in a secure mental hospital with post-traumatic stress and depression. ‘I feel sorry for Shrien,’ she says. ‘He is my son-in-law and he is as ruined by this as we are. He is ill, and I have sympathy with him. His life is broken for ever. ‘But he will get the chance to get better. What about my Anni? What about her life?’ ‘I believed Shrien was truly in love with my daughter,’ she continues. ‘I just need him to tell me what happened. If he cannot, I will never, ever get over this. ‘I’ve lost my beautiful daughter. Unless he tells me the whole story –  this stress is killing me.’ Today there is no communication between the Dewani and Hindocha families. Last week they appeared in court together for the latest round of Shrien’s fight against extradition, but the mutual animosity was hard to disguise. Suspect: Shrien Dewani is facing a murder trial in South Africa but is fighting extradition on mental health grounds . Tragic: Beautiful Anni Dewani was murdered on her honeymoon . It is a sad end to a 40-year . friendship between the families, struck when part of the Hindocha clan . settled in Britain after Idi Amin’s 1972 purge of Ugandan Asians. Meanwhile Anni’s side of the family settled in Sweden. It . had seemed appropriate when in 2010 two good-looking children – . 30-year-old Shrien, a millionaire businessman, and Anni, 28 – were . married in a lavish £200,000 ceremony in Mumbai. As the world now knows, the happiness . was short-lived. The Hindochas had only just returned to Sweden when . they received the phone call from Shrien saying Anni had been kidnapped. Ill-fated: Shrien and Anni Dewani married in 2010 . ‘We hadn’t even unpacked,’ recalls Vinod Hindocha, Anni’s 64-year-old father. ‘Dewani called me and said, “Dad, I couldn’t take care of your daughter.” I said, “Shrien, she’s not dead. I’m coming, we’ll pay them whatever they want and we’ll get her back.” ‘But he just said it again, “I could not take care of your daughter.” ’ As if he knew her fate already.’ Mr Hindocha got the next flight to South Africa, but during a stop-over in Amsterdam was told the nightmare news that Anni had been found, dead, in an abandoned taxi. The circumstances of her death seemed strange from that first call. According to Dewani, Anni had wanted to see ‘the real Africa’ so they hired a taxi driver to take them to Gugulethu township, a dangerous suburb of Cape Town where their car was hijacked at gunpoint. To this day, Anni’s mother cannot understand why her daughter would have wanted to go to such a place. ‘Shrien knew that area was not good,’ Mrs Hindocha says. ‘No one really goes there at night. They were staying in Cape Grace Hotel and she would have loved the nightlife around there. She would never have recommended they go to Gugulethu in the middle of the night.’ When Dewani was named as a suspect by South African authorities, Nilam and Vinod were shocked. ‘How can you ever think that about the man you gave your little baby away to?’ asks Mr Hindocha. But the South African police had no such doubts. They accused Dewani of paying the couple’s taxi driver, Zolo Tongo, to arrange for a hitman to kill his new wife and make it look like the work of violent criminals. Their car was hijacked at gunpoint. Dewani claims the criminals let him and Tongo go, before driving off with his bride. Anni was never seen alive again. Tongo told South African police he had been approached by Dewani and asked to organise the killing. His 25-year sentence for murder was cut by seven years in return for this testimony. South African and British Police began a new line of enquiry in 2011 after Leopold Leisser, a German male prostitute, claimed Dewani had paid for sex sessions with him. Family: Anni Dewani's mother Nilam Hindocha (left) and Shrien Dewani's father Prakash (far right) attend court for his extradition hearing . He also said Shrien, who made his money through the family care home business, had told him he needed to find a way out of his engagement, but could not do so easily for fear of being disowned by his family. Dewani strenuously denies these accusations and says he is not gay. Anni took a year off between finishing university and finding a job to care for her mother following the discovery that Nilam had cancer of the uterus in 2006. Thankfully, she is now clear of cancer, but the side effects of the treatment continue to plague her. ‘The doctors say she should not have any stress,’ says Mr Hindocha. ‘But every day is a stress for her with this case. Shrien’s lawyer is always saying, “his health, his health, his health”. Has she thought of our health?‘ . Meanwhile, the case grinds on. At Westminster magistrates’ court last week, Dewani’s defence team asked for a six-month adjournment, arguing Dewani’s recovery could be irreparably damaged if he was extradited. Shrien remains at a secure Bristol mental hospital and did not attend the hearing, being deemed mentally unfit. Chief magistrate Howard Riddle will rule on the case later this month.

"The mother of Emma McQuiston, who will become Britain’s first black marchioness, has lambasted Lord and Lady Bath for refusing to attend her daughter’s wedding to their only son. Miss McQuiston, 27, daughter of a Nigerian oil tycoon, will marry  38-year-old Ceawlin Thynn, Viscount Weymouth, in the orangery of Longleat House, Wiltshire, on June 8. But the Marquess of Bath – famous for his string of ‘wifelets’ – and his real wife, Hungarian-born Anna Gael, 69, will boycott the ceremony. Happy couple: Viscount Weymouth Ceawlin Thynn, with his fbride-to-be Emma McQueen. They will marry on June 8 . Suzanna McQuiston told The Mail on Sunday: ‘They’ve both known Emma since she was three-and-a-half. She’s a wonderful, incredibly beautiful and sweet girl. I just can’t understand it. ‘One thing I would say is that I don’t want people going on about snobbery. Emma has been a regular at Longleat since she was three-and-a-half. Her sister-in-law is Lady Silvy [Ceawlin’s half-aunt]. It’s nothing new to Emma.’ Suzanne McQuiston said she can't understand why Lord and Lady Bath will not attend the wedding . Miss McQuiston, daughter of Nigerian . oil tycoon Ladi Jadesimi, admits her relationship with Lord Weymouth has . caused upset, telling this month’s issue of Tatler magazine: ‘There has . been some snobbishness, particularly among the much older generation. ‘There’s class and then there’s the racial thing. It’s a jungle and I’m going through it and discovering things as I grow up. 'I’m not super-easily offended but it’s a problem when someone’s making you feel different or separate because of your race. I have never had anything horrible said or happen, but it is something you sense. You can just tell with some people.’ Lord Bath threatened to boycott the wedding after Ceawlin (pronounced See-aw-lin) removed some of his father’s famously risque murals from the family’s Elizabethan stately home. The Mail on Sunday has learnt that the 81-year-old aristocrat will instead be a guest at Heloise Lorentzen’s marriage to professional polo player Sean Wilson-Smith on the same day. Ms Lorentzen is the daughter of Brazlilian philanthropist Cristina Eastwood. Lady Bath, who splits her time between Longleat and Paris, is thought to disapprove of Miss McQuiston, an aspiring celebrity chef. ‘She has asked her son to call it off,’ a friend of the family said. ‘She seems to think Emma isn’t good enough for him. Emma’s a lovely girl and is understandably hurt by this, as is her family. But Ceawlin loves Emma and won’t be swayed.’ Mrs McQuiston has apparently arranged a peace summit with Lord Bath but is not sure whether she will be able to change his mind. ‘I don’t know, I really don’t know,’ she said. ‘I’m hoping at the last minute they’ll come.’ Before her marriage to Lord Bath in 1969, Lady Bath was Anna Abigél Gyarmathy, a model turned actress best known as the shapely star of some of the most erotic films of the 1960s and 1970s. Naked fury: The Marquess of Bath, with his wife, is upset his son removed erotic murals at Longleat . In Therese And Isabelle in 1968, she stripped naked and simulated lesbian sex. She also disrobed for Zeta One in 1969, described as ‘the ultimate erotic extravaganza’. And in Take Me, Love Me Nana in 1970, she played a prostitute. She became known as the ‘Naked Lady of Longleat’ while a newspaper cutting from 1970 called her ‘the most remarkable thing to happen to the English aristocracy since Lady Godiva rode bareback into town’. Lord Bath fell out with his son after discovering he had taken down murals painted for Lord Weymouth and sister when they were children. The row is so fierce that the pair live in separate wings at Longleat and rarely meet. ‘As far as I can tell, Alexander likes Emma very much and we’re still friends,’ Mrs McQuiston said. ‘He’s terribly angry about having his murals taken down.’ Lord Bath told The Mail on Sunday: ‘It’s my life’s work and he’s quietly binned it. It’s killed my relationship with him and I don’t feel inclined to pay any interest in his wedding.’","Emma McQuiston, 27, will marry 38-year-old Ceawlin Thynn, on June 8 .

"John McCririck is everywhere I look. His wobbly features leer from several dozen framed photographs and press clippings that smother the walls of his teeny mews house in London’s Primrose Hill. There’s him with Maggie Thatcher, him smoking an enormous cigar and him next to an even more enormous pair of fake breasts. Most terrifying of all, though, is an oversize papier mâché effigy of the former Channel 4 pundit, complete with trademark deerstalker hat, gleaming white teeth and flailing tongue. There’s just one photograph of long-suffering wife Jenny, partly hidden behind a rubber plant. Support: Jenny McCririck, wife of the former Channel 4 horse-racing pundit John, thinks claims her husband is sexist are 'stupid' He has never been very nice about her and famously calls her ‘Booby’, because like the South American bird, he claims she’s ‘stupid, squawks a lot and was easy to catch’. But the women who emerges from an upstairs bedroom is surprisingly attractive; glamorous even. She has a lovely figure, an enviable pair of pins and looks much younger than her 68 years. How on earth this seemingly sane woman has managed 42 long years with racing’s favourite bigot is anyone’s guess. Yet not only does she defend the apparently indefensible, she does so with a matter-of-fact directness that makes the true situation all-too-clear: she is an integral part of team McCririck and its success for the past 30 years – the straight man to her husband’s comic turn. Case: John McCririck , pictured outside the Central Employment Tribunal, in central London, believes the channel and TV production company IMG Media Limited sacked him because of his age . ‘Oh, all that sexism stuff is absolutely stupid,’ Jenny says, in a thick Yorkshire twang. ‘People ask how I could be married to him, but John’s not like that in real life. It’s a façade. He’s actually very generous, kind and extremely hard-working. Ask any of his friends, they’ll tell you.’ The bosses of Channel 4, however, have taken a different view. Indeed, the 73-year-old’s well-established ‘routine’ was last week cited as the reason he was axed from the channel’s racing team last year. During an employment tribunal, which ended last Monday, the pundit’s former TV bosses rubbished his claim that he was ‘culled’ because of his age and said that his ‘irritating comedy act’ was over-dramatic, and liable to offend. Viewers wanted serious journalists and a more up-market programme. Channel 4’s claim has incensed Jenny, who has been driven to speak for the first time since the controversy began. ‘I don’t know what they’re going on about,’ she says, angrily. ‘He was encouraged to behave outrageously on Celebrity Big Brother and Wife Swap. ‘He also did the Million Pound Drop and was supposed to do Come Dine With Me. But it was Channel 4 who kept asking him to do these things for them. If they hated his act so much, why did they want him? ‘It never stopped him from being a serious journalist. He’s won press awards and has written for newspapers for years.’ Jenny adds: ‘Look, I know John’s getting older, but you can still work when you’re 73. Look at Bruce Forsyth [who’s 85] and Jeremy Paxman [63] They’re not young, but they can still do the job.’ It was a phone call last October that saw the end of the McCriricks’ world as they knew it. John had been in Las Vegas on a solo holiday when he was told by Channel 4’s commissioning editor for sport, Jamie Aitchison, that his contract was not being renewed after nearly three decades in the job. ‘Rumours were circulating that the older people would be axed and younger ones brought in,’ Jenny says. ‘John couldn’t believe it. He had been the face of Channel 4 Racing for so long. Facade: Mr McCririck's wife Jenny has supported in through the tribunal and says her husband is 'actually very generous, kind and extremely hard-working . ‘They told him just half an hour before they put out a press release,’ she adds, getting teary. ‘He was terribly, terribly upset and couldn’t believe they could do that to him after so many years. It was pure cruelty on their part. ‘People might say it was just a job, but to us, it was our whole lives. We worked so hard together. I used to get up at 4am to get the papers from King’s Cross so John could do a paper review. We built our life around it and Channel 4 has destroyed that life.’ Jenny admits the stress has made them both ill. Earlier this year John was rushed to hospital after collapsing at Cheltenham, while she has had chest pains. Since his sacking, John’s regular work has amounted to a twice-monthly stint on Sunday Forum, a chat show on the At The Races  channel, and he was seen last week on the Channel 5 show Celebrity  Wedding Planner, arranging a  couple’s wedding with Dead or Alive singer Pete Burns. Controversy: John McCririck, pictured posing with ladies on Ladies Day at Royal Ascot, was axed from Channel 4 because of his irritating comedy act, according to TV bosses . It seems his well-established reputation as a sexist is perhaps too far ingrained on potential employers’ minds. He got into hot water for calling Channel 4 Racing sidekick Tanya Stevenson ‘The Female’ and was scolded by former Channel 4 Racing presenter Lesley Graham for trying to nickname her ‘Crackling’. During Celebrity Big Brother he called fellow housemate Caprice ‘The Totty’. Despite this, Jenny is quick to defend her man. Experience: The 73-year-old has been a broadcast journalist for 35 years, working for BBC, ITV and Channel 4 . ‘If you say somebody is a slag or something, well that’s horrible. But John’s names were all nice,’ she says, adding that he would not use the names if the women objected. She is so fond of her own moniker  that it appears on her business card. ‘I really don’t get offended by Booby and don’t find it objectionable,’ Jenny says. ‘To me, it’s more a term of endearment.’ Jenny first met John at a party in 1970. He has claimed he was first attracted to her yellow Labrador, Simon, but took her on because she was attached to the end of his lead. If makes you wonder what exactly attracted Jenny to John. ‘Some people like boring people who go through life with no opinions and don’t antagonise people. Well, I don’t like boring people. Say what you like about John, but he was never boring. My parents didn’t like him at all. But look, I am happy! If I wasn’t, I would leave him.’ And what of John’s claims to have been something of a sexual athlete in the past? ‘Ridiculous!’ Jenny shrieks, making the sleeping cat jump. ‘It’s a joke! Anyway sex is not something I’m going to discuss. I know John would, but he’s just being silly. He said that to be outrageous.’ Earlier this year Jenny showed her steelier side when she told John off for discussing his penchant for big breasts with a female interviewer. ‘John thought it was a joke, but I didn’t,’ she says with a sniff. ‘He said what does it matter, but it does matter because that’s not the truth, he’s putting on an act. I was worried he wouldn’t be taken seriously during the tribunal as a result.’ The couple now face an agonising wait for the panel to reach its decision, which could take weeks. John is suing for £500,000 in lost earnings and £2.5million in damages. ‘I’m furious about the tribunal because it has become so expensive,’ says Jenny. ‘But we’re lucky, we own two houses in Primrose Hill [one of London’s most expensive residential areas – she admits the homes are worth several million] and don’t have any children to pay for. If we lose we won’t face ruin, but at the same time I don’t have that sort of money sitting in a bank. ‘That said, I wasn’t wary about doing the tribunal at all. John felt the only way he could move forward was to do this. I have to respect him for that. He has been treated appallingly. We’re talking about Channel 4. They’re supposed to hold a flag for integrity, diversity and fairness. ‘If we lose we’ll carry on in the knowledge that John did the best he could. If we win, we’ll do the same, but no amount of money can ever make up for what Channel 4 has done. John will never get over  it. Neither will I.’","Jenny McCririck, 68, has rubbished claims made against the journalist .

"The British schoolboy trapped in Abu Dhabi after developing a fear of flying is still in the Gulf state a year after The Mail on Sunday highlighted his plight. Joe Thompson, now 12, had been due to fly back to Britain with his family last June after his father Tony’s work contract in the UAE ended. He tried four times to board a plane with his family, but each time he broke down in tears and refused to fly. He subsequently refused to travel home by boat and overland. Now, a year later, Joe remains stranded 4,500 miles from home with his father while his worsening mental condition continues to baffle psychiatrists. Stuck: Joe Thompson has now developed an intense fear of all forms of transport and his behaviour has left psychiatrists baffled . Parted: Joe and his mother Pauline who can only see her son when she comes out to Dubai on holiday . The situation has reached an expensive impasse for Mr Thompson, 63, who risks bankruptcy as he tries to reconcile his son’s condition with his responsibility to his distraught wife Pauline, 49, and daughter Chloe, 17, who are back at the family home in Weston-super-Mare. Mr Thompson, a former aide to John Prescott, has pleaded for help to rescue his young son after spending his savings and borrowing £40,000 to fund their unexpected extended stay in Abu Dhabi. Impressive: There could be worse places to be stranded in the world than Abu Dhabi . He now fears he might be forced to sell their home in Britain. Joe has been diagnosed with Severe Anxiety Disorder and Flight Phobia, but Mr Thompson thinks his son’s problems go far deeper. He said: ‘The hypnotherapists and behavioural therapists he has seen said this is not all about flying. There’s something blocking him in the UK. He now needs some kind of medical intervention to prise open the secret.’ In the past year Joe has also been prescribed the anti-depressants Zoloft and Cipralex but he still refuses to return home and fills his time playing rugby, seeing friends, watching TV and going to the mall to surf Facebook. Mr Thompson said: ‘I’ve tried all . the  tactics to encourage Joe. When I’ve no money left, I will sit on . the British Embassy steps and say, “Here are our passports, we need . help.” ’ The situation has put a huge strain on Mr Thompson’s marriage. ‘It’s difficult because I don’t see Pauline,’ he said. ‘But . it’s no different to somebody in the military being sent away. We’re . still talking. We realise we have an end objective to get Joe home. It’s . like a project we’re working on.

"The death toll has risen to four following a charter plane crash in Papua New Guinea after a passenger died in hospital the day after the tragedy. The two pilots, including an Australian, and a passenger were killed when the Hevilift twin otter aircraft carrying nine people went down near Port Moresby on Saturday morning. Six other people survived the crash but the one passenger who was in a critical condition passed away on Sunday. An Australian male pilot died, along with his co-pilot, who was believed to a local woman, and a passenger, when he flew into a mountainside in Papua New Guinea after reducing altitude in poor visibility, it has been reported. Scroll down for video . A Hevilift twin otter aircraft similar to the one that crashed . The Hevilift twin otter aircraft came down about 10km from Goldie, near the capital Port Moresby. It is believed the plane was chartered by a Catholic parish in Woitape, with parishioners on board and a pastor among the injured. PNG Prime Minister Peter O'Neill offered condolences to the grieving families. 'The thoughts of the nation are with the families of the four people who lost their lives, and we pray for the recovery of the five survivors,' he said in a statement. The prime minister assured the public the cause of the crash would be fully investigated. 'It is important that people do not jump to conclusions as to what caused the incident,' Mr O'Neill said. A Hevilift spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia that the company 'swiftly commenced rescue operations and can confirm there are six survivors, one in critical condition'. The passengers are being treated at Port Moresby General Hospital. The spokeswoman added: 'Three tragically lost their lives. 'The company will be conducting a thorough investigation and is cooperating with all relevant authorities to determine the cause.

"The Monty Python team are set to reunite in a surreal sci-fi comedy film. Former member Terry Jones has written a script which involves a hapless teacher suddenly given God-like powers by a council of odd aliens – and he is lined up to direct it. But although John Cleese, Michael Palin, Terry Gilliam and Jones himself have all agreed to voice the aliens, their colleague Eric Idle has refused to sign up. Tensions: From left, actors Michael Palin, John Cleese, Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam and Eric Idle, pictured in 2009, could be getting back together for a new film . His stance is thought to have deterred investors in the film, titled Absolutely Anything – and could rob each of the other Pythons of a £3.5 million payday. Producers, who include Jones’s son Bill, have raised only £10 million of the £30 million needed, and are said to be desperately keen to talk Idle round. But it seems unlikely, after Idle wrote on Twitter: ‘These Python reunion rumours are just b******s. Some greedy b****** producer in Hollywood floating an idea.’ If the film gets off the ground, it would also star Robin Williams as the voice of a talking dog – while Star Trek heartthrob Benedict Cumberbatch and former Bond girl Gemma Arterton have reportedly been approached for leading roles. New film: A 44-page document has been aimed at potential backers for the film . A 44-page document aimed at potential backers with at least £1 million to invest suggests that Idle could still be involved. However, he has been steadfast so far – and explained on Twitter that he has not turned down a Python reunion but a film that just happens to have the involvement of his former colleagues. He wrote: ‘I’m not “Not in a Python film”. I’m not in a Terry Jones film. If you can’t see the difference then you should probably lie down for a bit.’ In the pitch, Jones writes: ‘It’s a funny script so I guess the idea is to make it into a funny film. It has a laugh rate comparable to Monty Python And The Holy Grail or Life Of Brian so it is my sacred duty to make it funny on film!’ It would not be the first time Idle has shunned a reunion, as he was the only ex-Python not to contribute to last year’s film A Liar’s Autobiography, about Graham Chapman – their colleague who died in 1989. However, he earns millions from the Python legacy as creator of the hit Spamalot musical. Idle has joked in the past that there would be a reunion just as soon as Chapman ‘comes back from the dead’. But he has tried to reunite the group before, mooting a sequel to Holy Grail in 1998 that Cleese rejected. Instead he wrote Spamalot, which only caused more tensions in the group after he complained about the royalties he had to pay his former colleagues. Cleese, who has made no secret of the fact he needs cash to fund a £20 million divorce, dubbed his fellow comic ‘Yoko Idle’ in reference to Yoko Ono’s reputation for breaking up The Beatles, when he tweeted: ‘I see Yoko Idle’s been moaning (again), about the royalties he had to pay the other Pythons for Spamalot. Apparently he paid me “millions”.’ Later, he added: ‘Actual rough figures last time we checked – Yoko Idle $13m, Michael Palin $1.1m, the others just under a million each .  .  .’ Hilarious: Terry Jones says that the new film script has a laugh rate comparable to 1979's The Life of Brian .","Terry Jones has written a script for a new film called Absolutely Everything .

"She is known for writing about  her colourful private life, her dramatic conversion to Islam and a spectacular falling-out with her half-sister, Cherie Blair. So perhaps it’s no surprise that when Lauren Booth decided she wanted a new husband, she advertised on Facebook. And after announcing her quest for a partner to her 7,000 Facebook ‘friends’ last year, Ms Booth, 45, has now announced she is wed. Activist Lauren Booth is pictured with her husband Sohale Ahmed whom she met after posting an ad on the internet . The Mail on Sunday can reveal her husband is Sohale Ahmed, a devout Muslim and divorced father of three from Stockport, Manchester. Mr Ahmed must have survived a stern examination of his credentials to earn Ms Booth’s affections. For in her Facebook announcement, she promised a ‘series of rigorous tests of din [religion], finances and personality’. He would have to have his own teeth and be able to ‘pray’ and to ‘pay’, she added. Secret drinkers, CIA stooges and anyone who  fancied Sunday roast at her brother-in-law Tony Blair’s house were told they need not apply. The journalist and broadcaster – a vocal opponent of the Iraq War who now works for Iran’s state-owned news channel Press TV – said anyone who wished to have lunch with Mr Blair was discounted because it meant they liked eating with ‘Muslim-murdering former leaders’. Ex-husband: Lauren Booth and actor Craig Darby pictured on their wedding day in 2000 . ‘Still interested?’ Ms Booth asked at the end of the advert. ‘Well, you’d better be brave and funny.’ Despite issuing such a daunting challenge, Ms Booth has now reported her marriage on Facebook. Mr Ahmed is listed as the managing director of Ms Booth’s pro-Palestinian charity, Peace 2012. Her 49-year-old new husband has also posted Facebook pictures of Ms Booth. It is unclear how the couple met, but Ms Booth, a devout Muslim and human-rights activist, has spoken at various rallies and events, produced by Mr Ahmed through his company X Events. It is not the first time Facebook has played a major role in Ms Booth’s life. Strict criteria: Activist Lauren Booth announced that she was looking for a partner on Facebook . In 2009, she changed her Facebook status from ‘married’ to ‘divorced’, following a row with her first husband Craig Darby when they and their two daughters lived in France. Days later, a serious motorbike accident left him with brain injuries. The accident and recovery were documented by Ms Booth in newspaper articles. Though she had admitted that changing her Facebook status was juvenile, she later wrote that despite being grateful her husband had survived the crash, the man she had loved was dead. ‘I miss my dead husband, his passion and his bravery,’ she wrote. The couple divorced in 2011.","Ms Booth, 45, announced her quest for a partner on Facebook .

"A mother threw her 11-month-old daughter from her arms to save her life seconds before she was run over and killed by a bus in Sydney. Mijin Shin, 38, died after the accident at Beecroft in Sydney's north in May 2012 but her baby Meera amazingly survived the horrific event. Witness Sam Agostino broke down in court recounting the moment he rescued the baby from the busy road moments after her mum pushed her out the way of the bus. Scroll down for video . Mijin Shin, 38, died after the accident at Beecroft in Sydney's north in May 2012 but her baby Meera amazingly survived the horrific event . He told the inquest: 'I picked up the baby and the baby started screaming. I thought that was the best thing because obviously the baby was alive.' The inquest has heard it was Ms Shin's final 'selfless act' of throwing her 11-month-old baby Meera, whom she was carrying when she crossed the road, that saved the baby's life. Ms Shin's other daughter, Kelly, 11, who was returning from a three day school camp, was on the bus that hit her mother. The Glebe Coroner's Court heard that Ms Shin, was distracted by waving to her daughter on the bus when she crossed the road. Mr Agostino was waiting at the traffic lights next to the bus. He said he saw the bus turn left and noticed a woman walking across the road. He said the bus clipped the woman and pulled her under it. 'I saw something fling out of her hands but I didn't think anything of it at that point,' he said. Mr Agostino said he started running after the bus yelling 'stop, stop'. 'I started bashing on his window and he came to a stop,' he said. Mijin was tragically killed by a bus in 2012 in Beecroft . 'I turned back and I looked at her - it was pretty bad.' An emotional Mr Agostino said Ms Shin had rolled under the bus between the front and rear axles. He said the bus driver was doing the best he could and performed CPR on Ms Shin. Senior Constable Wayne Stephenson said in his opinion the pedestrian crossing light was green but Ms Shin was in a blind spot. 'The blind spot on the bus played a big role,' the crash investigator said. The location of the fatal crash was a known black spot, the inquest heard, and had been the scene of serious injury crashes in the past. A mother holding her baby girl was distracted by waving to her other daughter on a bus when she was hit and killed on a Sydney road, an inquest has heard.","Mijin Shin, 38, was killed at Beecroft in Sydney's north in May 2012 when she was hit by a bus .

"It could have been a scene from Footballers’ Wives: an unexpected knock on the door forces a veteran Arsenal defender with 117 England caps to hide next to the Hoover in a dark cupboard and wait, heart-in-mouth, for a chance to escape while pleasantries are exchanged outside. But this isn’t yet another tawdry tale of an overpaid, badly behaved Premier League player. Indeed, the indignity of the situation was not lost on England women’s football star Casey Stoney. At the age of 25, she literally found herself ‘in the closet’, because her then-girlfriend was too scared to let her visiting family know she was in a same-sex relationship. Scroll down for video . 'Two mums': Casey Stoney (right) with her partner Megan Harris, who fell pregnant after three rounds of IVF . Indeed, for much of her early life Casey, now 32, suffered anxiety about being homosexual and was often in denial about her feelings. ‘For many years I felt isolated and scared,’ she says. ‘I’ve even pretended to have boyfriends; all because I was afraid of being rejected by society.’ It was only her strong desire to start a family that finally spurred the England player to come out publicly last February. As one of the women’s game’s biggest stars – she was England captain until this year and led the GB side in the London 2012 Olympics – Casey says she was also inspired by diver Tom Daley, who made an emotional revelation last December that he was in a relationship with a man. Even so, she braced herself for a backlash when she announced three months ago that she and her pregnant fiancee, Megan Harris, a former team-mate, are expecting twins in November. The response was overwhelmingly positive, with congratulations from Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and comedian Matt Lucas among many others. It’s a sign, she suggests, that Britain is becoming more accepting. Casey, a defender, has 117 England caps, scoring six goals . Internet trolls, however, did question their right to have a child without a father. ‘They seemed to suggest we were doing something unnatural,’ Casey says. ‘But what does a normal family look like? As long as children have the love and support they need, it shouldn’t matter whether they are brought up by two mums, two dads or one of each.’ A willowy brunette, Casey is more guarded than her shorter, more vivacious blonde partner. But she is resolute in her desire to go public: ‘We think it’s important for people to be proud of who they are. It’s not going to be a secret. ‘We want our kids to know the truth from day one and to grow up proudly knowing they are loved and wanted by a family unit with two mummies. ‘Society now is not what it was 20 or 30 years ago. Why is it so important to have one mother and one father? It’s about being with people who love and care for you. ‘Many children now come from single parent households. I grew up with my mum as my constant and my dad around only at weekends. 'Our children will have heavy male presence from both sets of extended families and friends.’ Casey says speaking out has been difficult given her history of hiding her own sexuality. Before she met Megan at Lincoln Ladies football club in 2011, Casey says her relationships always felt like ‘a dirty secret’. And although she insists she is not a spokeswoman for lesbian rights, she adds: ‘I felt it was important for me to speak out when so many people still struggle with being gay. ‘Some teenagers kill themselves out of despair. But it’s not freaky or unnatural, it’s a matter of fact that some people unfortunately find difficult to accept.’ Describing herself as a talker, emotional, impulsive and driven, Casey insists that the apparently more laid-back Megan is ‘as steady as a ship’ and ‘wears the trousers’. Certainly, the heavily pregnant blonde has an easy confidence fostered by her family’s full support when she came out at university. The same cannot be said about Casey, whose childhood in Basildon, Essex, was marked by poverty and self-loathing. Her parents divorced over her father’s gambling addiction when she was seven, leaving her mother to work three jobs to make ends meet. Casey says her school shoes were lined with cardboard and her football boots were second-hand. At 15, Casey realised she was ‘different’ from her female friends. ‘I had crushes on boys and even had a boyfriend at school, but I never really felt the physical attraction. I didn’t feel it for girls either, but I felt something inside me wasn’t right.’ Football was her salvation. ‘I could lose myself during training and games,’ she says. ‘Then one day I realised that I was too curious about a girl on my team who was gay. When I saw her with her partner it appealed to me. ‘I was 17 and suddenly I knew I was gay. But it frightened me. ‘I didn’t want to act on it. I was basically terrified that people would no longer love me.’ Casey said she was inspired by diver Tom Daley, who posted a video on YouTube in December last year in which he revealed that he was in a relationship with a man . A year later she found the courage to tell her parents. Her mother took a little time to accept the news, but her father didn’t bat an eyelid. And yet Casey’s love life remained in the shadows, with partners who also feared exposure. ‘It’s only since meeting Megan that I’ve felt loved and secure,’ she says. After a year together they decided to try for a family using an anonymous sperm donor. Megan’s eggs were used because her desire to give birth was greater. After three rounds of IVF, costing £15,000 at a London clinic, Casey announced the pregnancy in her column for the BBC sports website. She says she has had ‘incredible support’ inside the game, including from several male professionals. She believes many sports stars fear declaring their sexuality, and says it is easier for women players to come out as gay than men. ‘It’s a massive step. The fear of what fans can do keeps them quiet. The language from the stands can be very brutal.’ It is, she argues, probably easier to be a gay woman footballer. ‘We don’t get abuse hurled at us from the terraces. Our profile is not as big as the men and we don’t have the kind of commercial success, with all the business obligations that entails.’ Nevertheless, Casey is anxious not to reinforce the stereotype that all women footballers are gay. The percentage, she believes, is probably around 30 to 40 per cent, which she explains by suggesting it is harder for women to stay in the game if they have children. It is an issue she hopes to highlight as the first woman to join the Professional Footballers’ Association committee. Meanwhile, she is – at last – feeling good about herself. ‘Knowing I was going to be a mum made me more accepting of myself and gave me the strength to go public, she says. ‘I had to be honest and transparent for the sake of my children. They will be strong and proud of who their mothers are. Hopefully, by the time they grow up, lesbians with children will be less of an issue. ‘Perhaps, 20 years from now, they will walk down the road and see same-sex couples holding hands and no one will bat an eyelid.’","Casey Stoney and her partner Megan Harris are expecting twins .

But now the 40-year-old has hit back by appearing on a TV show in LA about sex and relationships and defended her decision to reveal her identity as escort Samantha X. Goff says she is not ashamed of her decision to go public and says she is the 'happiest' she has ever been.

The mother-of-two was surprised her book, Hooked — Secrets of a High-Class Escort went global . 'What's surprised me is that it's gone global... 'It's not the first book that's been written about it, nor will it be the last. 'Maybe it's because I have children? Because I'm 40? Because I'm owning it?

Ms Goff, who has worked at New Idea, InStyle and Prevention magazines says she is 'living the life I am supposed to be living'.

'Not to be ashamed of who you are - that's what I want to teach my kids. 'I'm not going to apologise because I offend people. Like it or love it, people are buying the book.' Ms Goff hit back after the initial criticism she suffered after the interview on Sunday Night. In an article in the Herald Sun she claimed her life was 'boring and normal' after the media storm. The 40-year-old dismissed criticism that her children were negatively affected by her career choice, writing in the Herald Sun: 'Professions do not define our parenting skills' 'So far, the only thing we had to deal with at school this week was my son getting hit on the head with a soccer ball, which caused a few tears. 'So, while I appreciate your concern, my kids are fine, thank you very much. How are yours?' Ms Goff claims her job as a sex worker, is more ethical than her former career as a journalist in which she admits she hid in bushes and illegally hacked phones. She revealed she chose to go public in the tell all interview with Channel Seven's Sunday Night - after publishing her book under the name 'Samantha X' - because she wanted to have control. Ms Goff spends one week as a full-time mother to her children - who she shares custody with Mr Basha - and the next in a luxury apartment in Sydney's CBD where she carries out her life as Samantha X .

"Fears are growing that terrorists locked up in Australia's most secure prison are communicating with people on the outside using code to try and plan more Jihadi activities. Prisoners at Goulburn ­Supermax in NSW are shockingly being given the chance to plot acts of terror from behind bars because they are allowed to write letters, make phone calls and have visits- even though they are in 'confinement'.

The inmates are also allowed televisions, natural lighted and spacious cells. These men are considered to be so dangerous that they are escorted to court ­appearances and other appointments by guards armed with rocket launchers and machine guns while being supported by helicopters and armoured vehicles.

"A pet shop has come under fire after a poster was put up in a Pizza Hut store saying that 'small animals' were going to be giving away free with any purchase of 10 large pizzas. Pets Story in Mount Waverley, in Melbourne's southeastern suburbs, made the promotion boo-boo over the weekend when the word 'kit' was missed off the poster. The mistake has caused a storm on social media with users calling for the Pizza Hut to be boycotted. It should have read 'Buy any 10 large pizzas and get one small animal kit from Pets Story'. The controversial poster crucially missed out the word 'kit' which should have appeared after animal . The strange advertising campaign between the pet shop, Pizza Hut and a coffee shop in Mount Waverley was supposed to run until December 31 but has been pulled after the controversy. A Facebook group called 'Pizza Hut needs to make amends for live animal promotion' was set up calling for the chain to donate $5000 to the RSPCA. A spokesman for Pets Story told Daily Mail Australia: 'The poster was put up in haste and it was not proof-read. 'The word 'kit' was missed out and so it was a complete misprint. We have apologised for the mistake and there is nothing more we can do. Pets Story was supposed to celebrating its two year anniversary with the campaign . 'It was supposed to say small animal kit which meant anyone over 18 spending a certain amount at Pizza Hut could have come into us and got a free kit their small animal. 'It was things like a bird set, a fish tank or a hamster cage. 'We don't sell cats or dogs, there is no way we would give away free animals, we only have four rabbits in our whole entire store. 'We work with animal adoption and rescue groups so there is no way we would give away animals. 'It has been a bit of a nightmare with our email and social media accounts clogged. 'The promotion was being done to coincide with our two year anniversary.' Social media went mad after the poster was put up and users said the Pizza Hut should be 'boycotted' A spokesman for Pizza Hut said: 'It has come to our attention that one of our stores have recently been running a promotion which was not approved by Pizza Hut Australia, nor was condoned in any circumstances. 'We would like to sincerely apologise to anyone who was offended by this. 'The poster has since been taken down and all those involved have been made aware of the severity and inappropriateness of the promotion. 'We would like to thank and all those who have brought this to our attention this evening.

"Brief encounter: John Paul II with the Queen in 1982 . It was a historic occasion as the Queen welcomed the first reigning Pope to visit Britain in 1982. But the visit of John Paul II – whose modernising style and charisma gave him ‘pop star’ like popularity – was dogged by bitter diplomatic wrangles over his meetings with Elizabeth II and Margaret Thatcher. The Pontiff’s reluctance to spend time with the Queen and the then Prime Minister sparked a row with ‘high-handed’ Vatican officials, according to Foreign Office papers obtained by The Mail on Sunday under Freedom of Information laws. A document from the run-up to the visit, dated December 15, 1981, reveals the concerns of the Pope’s advisers. It states: ‘As regards a call at the Palace, the Pope would be unlikely to accept an invitation to lunch with the Queen. To do so could set an unwelcome precedent in that the Pope would be obliged to accept similar invitations for heads of state in whichever countries he visited.’ The Queen did meet the Pope during the six-day tour of Britain, but she had to be content with a 30-minute private meeting which the Pope fitted in between public engagements on the day he arrived, May 28, 1982. A meeting with Mrs Thatcher proved even more problematic. At an early planning meeting the Foreign Office was ‘keen to put down a marker to the effect that the Prime Minister has expressed a desire to offer some sort of entertainment to the Pope’. But the Archbishop of Westminster – one of Britain’s most senior Roman Catholics – poured cold water on the idea. The minutes state: ‘The Archbishop emphasised the Pope would not wish to neglect any of the proper courtesies, but the programme was going to be extremely crowded. ‘He wondered whether the proper degree of contact could be achieved if she came to the reception he was to give on Day Two and a room was provided where they could have a tete a tete meeting.’ The Pontiff’s reluctance to spend time with the Queen and Margaret Thatcher during the visit, pictured, sparked a row with ‘high-handed’ Vatican officials, according to Foreign Office papers . Mrs Thatcher feared the lack of a formal private meeting would be seen as a snub, a Foreign Office memo from November 20, 1981 reveals, saying: ‘The Prime Minister would think it was liable to excite adverse comment if contact between her and the Pope were limited to a handshake during a large reception.’ One memo in the files states: ‘Concerned to hear of some evidence of high-handedness in Papal entourage.’ The documents from 1981 do not detail why the Pope may have been reluctant to meet the Prime Minister, although one memo refers to ‘current Irish developments’. It is known that the Pope was concerned about the treatment of the IRA hunger strikers who were protesting in 1981.","John Paul II visited the Queen in 1982 for 30 minutes during six-day visit .

"With a high collar, feathered headdress and Edwardian updo, this glamorous figure looks like a lady grand enough to rival the Dowager Countess of Grantham. But Dame Maggie Smith need not panic. It is not a new actress joining the cast of Downton Abbey but Gary Carr, who tonight becomes the drama’s first black actor when he plays jazz singer Jack Ross. And fans of the popular ITV show can rest easy because our exclusive photograph was taken when Carr was still at drama school. Style swapping: Left, new cast member Gary Carr in drag as Simone Pistache in a production of Can-Can when he was a drama student and right, the Dowager Countess of Grantham played by Maggie Smith . Carr, who harbours ambitions to be a . professional singer, agreed to dress up as a woman to land the lead role . in a production of Cole Porter’s risque 1953 musical Can-Can. The . 26-year-old, who studied at the London Academy Of Music And Dramatic . Art, played Simone Pistache, the outrageous owner of a Parisan club. Carr said: ‘I remember telling my tutors I wanted a role which would allow me to transform myself. ‘I told them to push me to the limit and throw me in at the deep end, and this is what they came up with. 'I . had to transform myself completely so I could play a female lead and . the madam in charge of a Moulin Rouge-type whorehouse in Paris.’ Dame Maggie Smith won’t be the only . Downton leading lady to raise her eyebrows at Carr’s former incarnation. Shirley MacLaine, who plays the formidable Martha Levinson in the . costume drama, starred as Pistache in the 1960 big-screen adaptation of . the musical. Tight lipped: Carr said his character would be drawn both to Lady Rose and Lady Mary but wouldn't say whether either encounter was romantic . Not shy: Carr has made quite an impression on fans since his Lion King days showing off his finely honed torso through his work . Downton Abbey’s 12 million fans will . get their first glimpse of Carr tonight when jazz singer  Jack Ross ends . up at Downton following a chance meeting in  a London club. Producers . are keeping his storylines under tight wraps but last night Carr . admitted his character would be drawn to both Lady Mary, played by . Michelle Dockery, and the flighty Lady Rose, played by Lily James. He . said: ‘All I can say is that he interacts with both Lady Mary and Lady . Rose. Whether one of the relationships is romantic and one isn’t, I . can’t say. ‘Both of these two characters end up . being quite prominent in his life. He has to ask a lot of questions . about himself as he is drawn closer to certain characters.’ Carr says Jack’s arrival raises eyebrows above and below stairs, but viewers won’t be confronted with hard-hitting racism. He said: ‘Jack has a maturity and a self confidence, and when he enters a room he knows all eyes are on him. He is not arrogant. He is very suave and cool. But when a foreign object or character enters an environment, there are bound to be a lot of questions. Jack finds himself faced with ignorance rather than prejudice.’ Viewers are still reeling from the brutal rape of lady’s maid Anna, played by Joanne Froggatt, on last week’s episode, but Carr has only praise for the way the attack was depicted. He said: ‘I think it was extremely well written and extremely well acted. What I love is that Downton is giving its audience an education about those particular times. It’s interesting to see how a woman would deal with rape back then. It’s not like today. She wouldn’t have lawyers or any support mechanism.’ Carr, who appeared in a West End . production of The King And I when he was just seven years old, will . perform all of his own numbers in the show. He is also working on an . album of original material, which he hopes to release next year. Suave and cool: Carr, pictured on set as Jack Ross, says he admires his character's maturity and confidence . The actor – who has shown off his finely honed torso in plays – said: ‘I am a singer and dancer first. That is what is really funny about life. I have always been singing and writing music, and I play the piano and the guitar.  I was born to dance and my education is every MGM musical you can think of with Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly. That is why I am recording music this year and looking to sign and officially release music as a singer next year. That is the career I wanted first.’ Carr says he is glad that Jack is a positive character rather than a victim. He said: ‘I have avoided those kinds of roles. There are loads of shows where every time you see a black character they are wearing hoodies or they are gangsters. That is very tiring.’ Carr says his mum and sister are ‘crazy Downton fans’ who can’t believe he is in the show. Unfortunately, his grandparents, Clive and Marjorie, live in Trinidad, one of the few countries where Downton isn’t shown. Clive, 80, said: ‘It would have been nice to see Gary in the show, but we will have to wait for a DVD.’","Singer, song-writer Gary Carr will join the cast to play jazz singer Jack Ross .

"She has just been named the UK's top style icon and has barely put a Louboutin-shod foot wrong since launching her debut label six seasons ago. But can you tell the difference between Victoria Beckham's  new budget line, VVB, and the high street copycats? Her new boutique will be opening in London this week, displaying Victoria Victoria Beckham dresses as well as accessories and denim. Scroll down for video . Striking gold: One of these dresses is £249 from M&S, but Victoria's design is almost three times as much . I felt so fabulously ‘Veebs’ wearing these gold dresses that I didn’t even feel absurd wearing sunglasses indoors – a look Victoria has been not-quite-perfecting since her Spice Girl days. I’m not sure how many non-famous people could get away with wearing a leather dress outside of my stomping ground of Soho, but this was definitely my favourite. Fit for a duchess: This lilac dress is a little demure for a girl about town, but Kate could pull it off . VVB’s crepe-silk lilac dress is so genuinely posh I can easily imagine the Duchess of Cambridge slipping into it for Royal functions. But it’s a little demure for a Girl Tottering About Town and the fabric was so delicate I creased it just by looking at it. Realistically, only someone with a ladies’ maid could rely on this dress as a wardrobe staple. For the red carpet: One of these almost-identical dresses is 27 times more expensive than the other . After years of red carpet events and premieres (darling) I thought I’d developed a serious case of expensive taste, so I was surprised to find I preferred the cheap dress to Victoria’s. Probably a good thing, because although I party with the stars, I don’t have the budget of one. A wag's whitemare: This ensemble feels a little Posh Spice circa 2006 when she was crowned Queen WAG . I did NOT feel very posh wearing Victoria’s bodycon white dress with a sheer panel. In fact, I felt like Posh Spice circa 2006, the year she was crowned Queen WAG at the World Cup for wearing outfits so skimpy that her boobs practically fell out. By comparison, the Jane Norman imitation felt almost luxurious. Both are the kind of dresses I’d expect to see worn on TOWIE – or at Aintree’s infamously naff Ladies’ Day. Loving the LBD: These little black dresses will make you feel a million dollars and could bag you a footballer . I felt a million dollars in this little black dress. So much so, I half-expected a multi-millionaire former footballer and national treasure to materialise and take my arm. Sadly, even this exquisitely made dress couldn’t work miracles. But if you want to bag a footballer, remember – VB did so in hotpants, not an LBD. Dinnerlady chic: Maybe Victoria thinks that this apron-inspired look will catch on? At the risk of getting myself struck off the guestlist for Victoria’s launch party, I think she has had a private chef for too long. She has clearly forgotten what a dinnerlady looks like, or maybe she thinks ‘Apron Chic’ will catch on. Then again, I doubt Veebs does much washing up – perhaps that’s why she didn’t notice her dress looks like a tea towel.

"Prince Harry may have resigned himself to starting his 30s as a single man – but he’ll be less prepared for the news that the woman who was his first true love is set to announce her engagement. Chelsy Davy is expected to reveal this week that she is marrying society jeweller Charles Goode. The 28-year-old, who dated Harry on and off for seven years, has spent the past two weeks on a romantic holiday in Africa with Charles. Scroll down for video . Besotted: Chelsy Davy and her jeweller boyfriend Charles Goode in London earlier this year . Inseparable: The couple have been inseparable since they began dating last year . The couple, who began dating last year, have been travelling through Zambia, Mozambique and Malawi, spending their time fishing, trekking and going on safari. Last week they climbed to the peak of the 9,000ft Mount Mulanje, where Charles is thought to have popped the question. A friend of the couple told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Charles was planning to propose on holiday and everyone thinks he has now done it. 'He is off-comms out there, so if there is an announcement it will come this week when they return home.’ The pair have been inseparable since they met. Charles is a third-generation jeweller at Goode & Son, a brand worn by the Beckhams, Kate Moss and Kate Winslet. Is this the ring he'll give her? The jeweller posted this photo of a gold and diamond ring on his Instagram . Did he propose at the peak of this African mountain? They climbed Malawi's 9,000ft Mount Mulanje last week . Like Prince Harry, Charles is besotted by all things African, and earlier this year he designed a £2,600 bracelet for Liberty of London called Hope, based on the West African Adinkra symbol. A friend of Charles and Chelsy revealed: ‘He made it pretty clear before he left for Africa that he wants to marry Chelsy.’ Intriguingly, Charles took to his Instagram page a month ago to post a picture of a gold and diamond ring resting on a log in Mozambique’s Pestana Bazaruto Lodge. He called it an ‘Antique Angel’ ring. News of an engagement would come as a bittersweet moment for Harry. He still counts Chelsy as a close friend, but is said to readily admit that she has been the great love of his life. Many of the Prince’s friends regard Chelsy as ‘the right girl at the wrong time’. The Zimbabwean’s sense of humour is said to be the reason their on-off relationship continued until 2012, when she finally ended it for good. Lost opportunity: Many of the Prince’s friends regard Chelsy as ‘the right girl at the wrong time’ She reportedly told pals she didn’t want to be a full-time Royal, saying: ‘It’s not a life for me.’ She has since carved out a career for herself as a lawyer. One source told The Mail on Sunday last night: ‘The years Harry was with Chelsy were some of the happiest of his life. 'There has always been a sense that he might get back with her one day. 'Of course, if she marries that will no longer be the case.’ With his 30th birthday next month, the Prince is understood to be anxious about being alone. Earlier this year he split from Cressida Bonas, and he is said to be worried that media attention makes it hard for him to find a long-term girlfriend.","Chelsy Davy and Charles Goode have been inseparable since last year .

"As the Everly Brothers, they rewrote the rock ’n’ roll rule book and became one of the most influential acts in musical history. But a heartbroken Don Everly last night said he wanted to mark the death of his brother Phil by remembering the man – not the legend. In an emotional tribute, Don said: ‘I loved my brother very much. I always thought I’d be the one to go first. The world might be mourning an Everly Brother, but I’m mourning my brother Phil Everly.’ Don, 76, revealed he was listening to one of Phil’s compositions just before he was told that his brother had died at the age of 74. He said: ‘It was one of my favourite . songs that Phil wrote. I took that as a special spiritual message from . Phil saying goodbye.’ In an emotional tribute, Don said: ‘I . loved my brother very much. I always thought I’d be the one to go first. The world might be mourning an Everly Brother, but I’m mourning my . brother Phil Everly’ Don said the love he felt for his brother survived any personal difference they had – including an acrimonious split that reportedly lasted a decade. He said: ‘Our love was and will always be deeper than any earthly differences we might have had. ‘My wife Adela and I are touched by all the tributes we’re seeing for Phil and we thank you for allowing us to grieve in private at this incredibly difficult time.’ Everly died on Friday night. He had been suffering complications from a lung disease and was being treated in hospital in Burbank, Los Angeles. His widow Patti, who blamed his death on a lifetime of cigarette smoking, said: ‘We are absolutely heartbroken. He fought long and hard.’ The Everly Brothers were best known for their steel-string guitar playing and close vocal harmonies and dominated charts on both sides of the Atlantic in the late 1950s and early 60s. Their biggest hits included Wake Up Little Susie, All I Have To Do Is Dream and Bye Bye Love. Their unique vocal style directly influenced The Beatles – who even referred to themselves early in their career as ‘the English Everly Brothers’. 'He . fought long and hard': The rock singer and lifetime cigarette smoker - . who scored hits with All I Have To Do Is Dream, Wake Up Little Susie, . and Bye Bye Love - died due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . The pair broke up on stage in 1973 and reportedly did not speak to each other for a decade except at their father’s funeral. They got back together at a reunion concert at London’s Royal Albert Hall in 1983 and three years later were among the first acts to be inducted  into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. However, a family source last night insisted relations between the pair had continued to be strained. Former model Erin Everly, who is the daughter of Don but says she considers Phil ‘a father figure’, also paid tribute last night, saying: ‘His voice was as pure as his heart. We are all devastated. Phil was a son, a brother, a father, a husband, a grandfather – and the glue that held us all together. He was a selfless man who was always laughing. He is the best man I have known.’ Phil Everly was married three times and had two sons, Jason and Chris, both singers and songwriters. Some of the world’s biggest stars have paid tribute. Sir Tim Rice, the Oscar-winning lyricist, tweeted: ‘Death of the great Phil Everly – one of the saddest musical exits of all time for me. He and Don were more influential than they ever knew.’ Brian May, the Queen guitarist, posted a tribute on his own website, saying he had learned his craft listening to the Everly Brothers. ‘I could probably write a book on the music of the fabulous Everly Brothers, but you’ll find echoes of their influence in a lot of our old Queen songs, and perhaps that is the best tribute,’ he said. He added: ‘I never met them.  Wish I had.  But they will always be my heroes.’ Legendary . duo: Along with his 76-year-old brother Don, the Everly Brothers still . hold the record for the most top 100 singles by any duo in history .

RIP.’ One of the most poignant tributes came from singer Nancy Sinatra who toured with the duo. She said: ‘Phil Everly is gone. Touring with Phil and Don was one of the thrills of my life. I love you Philip – God speed.’ English guitarist Albert Lee, who was the musical director for the brothers’ reunion concert, paid tribute to their unique sound. He said: ‘There was nothing like it. It was a combination of their country upbringing, and when they became teenagers they fell in love with rock ’n’ roll.’ American guitarist Duane Eddy, who produced Phil’s first solo album, described his death as ‘a huge blow’. Lord Sugar tweeted his three million followers: ‘Phil Everly of the Everly Brothers dies at 74. To all youngsters: Classic example why you must not smoke. His wife said that’s what killed him.’","Brother Don said: ‘I loved my brother very much. I always thought I’d be the one to go first .

"Hip hop's biggest names have been immortalised in a cookbook as a selection of tasty dishes. From Snoop (Dogg) stroganoff to (Missy) Tiramisu Elliot, the hottest rappers from today and yesteryear inspire their own classic recipe with a twist in Rapper's Delight: The Hip Hop Cookbook. Delights include thirty dishes such as Ludacrispy Duck, Public Enemiso Soup and Run DM Sea Bass. The tome takes a light hearted look at music and is evenly split into three categories of starters, mains and desserts. Snoop stroganoff sees Snoop Dogg inspire a classic recipe with a twist, with a nod to one of his most famous songs . Rapper's Delight celebrates the many humorous parallels between food and hip hop, making it a kitchen essential for anyone with a penchant for cooking, music or illustration. Or indeed all three. Aside from the odd innuendo such as 'Ho-Sin Sauce' - the book is expletive-free, making it more family-friendly than many of the songs by your favourite rappers. The concept is the brainchild of Joseph Inniss, who authored the tome. He is a self-confessed 'massive foodie', who enjoys creating dishes based on traditional recipes - with a twist. Peter Stadden designed the layout. He is a graphic designer and big hip hop fan. Previously working as an art director in the design/lifestyle magazine sector, Peter has since moved into interiors. Ralph Miller, the editor of the book, has a background in TV production and newspaper journalism. Kitchen essential Rapper's Delight celebrates the many humorous parallels between food and hip hop . The Tiramisu Elliot recipe references Get Ur Freak On, one of the authors' favourite Missy Elliot songs . The best upcoming illustrators lend their art to the tome, including Andy Baker who drew up the Wu-Tang Clam Chowder image . We aren't chefs but we're all keen foodies and love cooking,' says Ralph. 'The ideas for the recipes came from the rap artists and then we designed recipes to fit with their names, songs and their characteristics etc. For example - the name ""A Pie Called Quest"" came first, but due to their song ""Bonita Applebum"" we used appley cider in the pie where you might instead use ale. 'We are all fans of hip hop music and the book gave us the chance to combine our love for hip hop with our love for cooking. We don't personally know any of the featured rappers but have links to one or two through friends of friends and through the publishers. 'We are big fans of all the artists featured; the book is meant to be a tribute to them and that is why we have made reference to our favourite songs. We hope people will enjoy the puns and the artwork, can learn some new recipes and discover hip hop artists they might not be so familiar with. 'I was at school with Peter and at university with Joe, so we all go way back. The experience of long meetings spent planning the book, checking for typos and organising the launch party have certainly brought us closer together.' Biggie Smalls becomes Notorious P.I.G. with a side of 2Pak Choi . Famous rappers lend their views on the humorous read. 'There are all aspects of hip hop, but the best of it has unique blending of ingredients, detailed preparation as well as great taste,' said Chuck D from Public Enemy. 'Rapper's Delight connects like great food, makes too much sense,' he said. Each of the recipes is accompanied by a bespoke piece of artwork created by one of thirty of the best upcoming illustrators. They include Tom Clohessy Cole, who designed the cover, Hattie Stewart, who created the Public Enemiso Soup illustration, and Andy Baker, who drew up the Wu-Tang Clam Chowder image.

"Famous tenant: Christine Keeler lived in the central London flat . The traditional hunting- scene print on the sitting-room wall barely merits a second glance. And that, presumably, must have suited its owner just fine. For the unobtrusive picture’s true purpose was to conceal a ‘two-way mirror’ affording the voyeur a generous view of a bed that played a starring role in the Profumo Affair, the scandal that defined an era. Published for the first time, these pictures show where this mirror was installed in society osteopath Stephen Ward’s Central London mews house. What happened in this impersonally furnished bedroom was central to one of the Old Bailey’s most celebrated courtroom dramas. The . jury in the infamous 1963 trial were asked to decide whether Ward lived . off the earnings of girls he pimped out to his rich and powerful . friends. The nation . was enthralled. Although the jury never saw these pictures, they were . made aware that the two-way mirror existed. The question was: Who was . watching? Even . Christine Keeler, the model at the centre of the scandal, remains . engrossed by the mystery, saying recently: ‘Who knew who might be . looking in?’ The photographs of the two-way mirror are among a number taken by police in 1963 of Ward’s house. They have been suppressed by successive governments in a confidential file held in the National Archives for more than 50 years. Had . it not been for repeated representations over the past three months by . The Mail on Sunday, they would have stayed under lock and key until . 2046. Taken . by a Scotland Yard officer on June 27, a month before Ward’s trial, . they were found by this newspaper among letters and statements included . in a file labelled: ‘CRIM 1/4140’. The . images freeze the scandal in time. They show, outside the house in . Bryanston Mews West – just behind Marble Arch – two Sixties relics: a . Morris Minor convertible and a three-wheel Trojan bubble car. They also show that if the police . officers who searched Ward’s home that day anticipated finding an . exotically appointed bordello, they were to be mistaken. With few . personal touches, the bedroom and sitting room had the transitory air of . cheap lodgings. Peephole: A picture on the sitting room wall of Stephen Ward's central London mews house covers a hole behind a two-way mirror . In . one shot, there is a black-and-white TV in the corner and on the coffee . table letters lie next to an ashtray and a packet of Senior Service . cigarettes. Everything seems unremarkable . . .were it not for the . two-way mirror. Along with Ward, two of the scandal’s key protagonists lived at the address at various times in the early 1960s. First, . Ms Keeler, whose affair with Secretary of State for War John Profumo . forced his resignation and effectively toppled Harold Macmillan’s . government, and later her showgirl friend Mandy Rice-Davies. The architect’s plans for the house also feature in CRIM 1/4140. Clearly marked are the words ‘hole in the wall’ and its precise measurements. With the picture taken down, a voyeur could see into the bedroom . Other documents, including statements made to Lord Denning during his official inquiry into the scandal that are still deemed too explosive for release, remain under lock and key. After the judge’s summing up at his trial, Ward slunk away to a friend’s flat, wrote a suicide  note and took an overdose of barbiturates. Included in the file is a handwritten letter to the court written by a doctor at St Stephen’s Hospital, Chelsea, on July 31, the day afterwards. ‘This man has been admitted to this hospital this morning. He will be unfit to attend court today.’ In fact, he died three days later, not knowing he had been found guilty of living off the immoral earnings of Keeler and Rice-Davies. These days few doubt that Ward was the victim of a miscarriage of justice, scapegoated by a self-righteous Establishment. A campaign to overturn the verdict is currently being led by leading human- rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson QC. At the same time, Andrew Lloyd Webber, similarly convinced of Ward’s innocence, has turned his story into a musical now showing in the West End. Lord Lloyd-Webber said yesterday: ‘It is extraordinary in this day and age that so much material is still being held back. ‘It is time that all the documentation related to the case was released. We are, after all, talking about 2014. We are not living in the same climate as 1963.’ To some, there has never been a better time to shed whatever new light may be available on the murky episode. There has always been the suspicion that Scotland Yard, dutifully following orders from on high, were ‘out to get’ Ward. The file certainly suggests that they approached their task with gusto. Included in the file is a copy of Ward’s original charge sheet. It features two previously unaired allegations: that Ward facilitated abortions – then illegal – for a Miss M and a Miss W. Other side: The mirror on the wall of the Mews house bedroom . In the frame: The view of the bed at the centre of the Profumo Affair, the scandal that defined an era . However the charges, for which there was no evidence, were dropped before the osteopath faced court. At . his trial, Janet Barker, 20, a known prostitute, told the jury that . Ward brought her to Bryanston Mews to have sex with an unknown man. She . also whipped him and ‘received £1 for each stroke’. Miss Barker confirmed that she saw a hole-in-the-wall but did not recall that it was hidden by either a mirror or a picture. Nevertheless, . its existence was sordid enough in itself – particularly in 1963. And . the inference was clear. Ward was on the other side of the wall, . furtively looking on. A month before the photographs were taken, a journalist, Warwick Charlton, made reference to the mirror in a magazine article. ‘The . bedroom is one of the strangest I have seen,’ he wrote. ‘Some previous . occupant had made a large square hole through the bedroom wall to the . drawing room. 'There . is a one-way mirror from the drawing room looking in the bedroom. This . elaborate peephole is hidden by a picture of Buddha and Stephen laughed . when he saw me inspecting it. “That . was installed by an old eccentric who used to own this place,” he said. “I’m going to have it filled in as soon as possible.” ’ An exterior view of Stephen Ward's mews house in a 1963 police photo . It seems Ward may well have been telling the truth about the hole’s provenance. The flat was refurbished some years earlier by his friend, Stephen Halsall, the chairman of the Eagle Building Society. It was then sold to a company belonging to notorious slum landlord Peter Rachman. And at some point afterwards, Dennis Hamilton, the sleazy former husband of Diana Dors and a friend of Rachman, moved in – and, according to Keeler, brought the mirror with him. It had previously featured in the infamous sex parties Hamilton threw with Dors at their riverside mansion in Maidenhead, Berkshire. When the couple separated, Hamilton moved the mirror to Bryanston Mews. Long before Ward took up residence, Rachman also lived at Bryanston Mews, first with Keeler then Mandy Rice-Davies. Other accounts suggest he, not Hamilton, installed the mirror. In her autobiography, Secrets And Lies, published in 2012, Keeler reveals that she was aware of the mirror’s racy history before it was installed at Bryanston Mews. Keeler wrote: ‘It had pride of place . up on the sitting-room wall . . . It wasn’t until later that I found out . the mirror had a crack in it – Diana [Dors], apparently, had broken it . and it didn’t work any more’. Scapegoat: Dr Stephen Ward is escorted from court by police in 1963 . Ward was also a friend of Rachman and attended the Maidenhead sex parties with him where, according to the biography Con-necting Dors: The Legacy of Diana Dors, ‘alcohol, erotic stimulants, willing starlets and exotic dancers contributed to a sexually charged atmosphere. 'The music throbbed, the dancing bordered on foreplay and inhibitions were suspended. ‘As intimacy developed into arousal, each couple was led to a special room and allocated 15 minutes, unaware that the room was fitted with two-way mirrors and their performance was a source of entertainment for select guests.’ Hamilton died in 1959 from tertiary syphilis. Like him, the mirror  he brought to Bryanston Mews is long gone. The house’s current owner, Gareth Jones, 54, said yesterday: ‘When I moved in 12 years ago, the builders told me there had been a hole for the two-way mirror but I never knew whether to believe them. ‘At the time, there was 1970s-style wallpaper with no evidence that there was any hole there. It was just a flat surface. So I suppose it must have been filled in.’ What other secrets the scandal will yield in the future remains to be seen. Geoffrey Robertson said yesterday that material was being held back for ‘irrational and wholly irresponsible reasons’, adding: ‘Stephen Ward was the scapegoat for the Profumo Affair and there continues to be a cover- up.’","Pictures suppressed for 50 years show peephole in Stephen Ward's home .

"Griff Rhys Jones yesterday led the . tributes to his long-standing comedy partner Mel Smith, who  died after . suffering a heart attack. Smith, his friend of 35 years, was a . ‘brilliant actor’ he said, and his death at the age of 60 had left . ‘everyone in a state of shock’. Smith died at his home in St John’s Wood, North London, where he lived with his wife of 25 years, Pam. Entertainer: Mel Smith died on Friday, aged 60, a loss which was described as a 'great shock' by his long-standing comedy partner Griff Rhys Jones . Paramedics were alerted shortly after . 9am on Friday but London Ambulance Service said he was ‘dead at the . scene’. Friends said that Smith had suffered a fall at home earlier in . the week ‘and had been unwell since’. Others said he been beset by ill health for months and had been ‘in and out of hospital’. Rhys Jones said yesterday: ‘I still . can’t believe this has happened. To everybody who ever met him, Mel was a . force for life. He had a relish for it that seemed utterly . inexhaustible. ‘He inspired love and utter loyalty . and he gave it in return. I will look back on the days working with him . as some of the funniest times that I have ever spent. We probably . enjoyed ourselves far too much, but we had a rollercoaster of a ride . along the way. 'Terrific business. Fantastic fun, making shows. Huge . parties and crazy times. And Mel was always ready to be supportive. Nobody could have been easier to work with.’ Sad news: The actor and director Mel Smith has died at the age of 60, his agent Michael Foster has confirmed . Comedy classic: Mel Smith (left) with his co-stars in Not The Nine O'Clock News Rowan Atkinson (back right) Pamela Stephenson (centre) and Griff Rhys Jones (front right) Dressed up: Mel Smith as Wilbur Turnblad, with Michael Ball as his wife Edna  in the the West End Musical 'Hairspray' The pair found fame in the late 1970s . in the ground-breaking satirical sketch show Not The Nine O’Clock News. But it was Alas Smith And Jones, which lasted for ten series over 16 . years, that guaranteed their place in the comedy firmament. In later years they set up the . independent television company, Talkback Productions. Rhys Jones went . on: ‘We never had an argument about which part we should play or how we . were going to do something. We never had an argument, in fact. We loved . performing together. He was a very generous and supportive actor. We had . a good deal of fun. ‘Mel was not a pressure person. He was . a gentleman and a scholar, a gambler and a wit. And he was a brilliant . actor. But he never took himself or the business too seriously. We are . all in a state of shock. We have lost a very, very dear friend.’ When he moved into the director’s . chair, Smith’s career flourished further, first with the acclaimed . romantic comedy The Tall Guy and later the hugely successful Rowan . Atkinson film, Bean. Atkinson, who was also in the Not The . Nine O’Clock News team with Pamela Stephenson, said: ‘Mel Smith – a . lovely man of whom I saw too little in his later years. Partners: Mel with his 'other comedy half' Griff Rhys Jones in TVs 'Smith and Jones in Small Doses' Double trouble: Mel in red and Griff Rhys Jones in green during a drinkers sketch on Not The Nine O'Clock News . ‘He was the cast member with whom I . felt the most natural performing empathy. He had a wonderfully generous . and sympathetic presence both on and off screen. ‘He was also an excellent theatre and . movie director, doing a wonderful job on the first Mr Bean movie. I feel . truly sad at his parting.’ John Lloyd, producer of Not The Nine . O’Clock News, said: ‘Mel did an extraordinary thing – he taught us all . how to make comedy natural.’ Comedy duo: Smith and Jones became famous in Not The Nine O'Clock News together . In 2007, Smith took to the West End . stage to play Wilbur Turnblad in the hit show Hairspray alongside . Michael Ball. Concerns about the multi-millionaire comedian’s health were . raised four years ago after he appeared on a celebrity version of . Mastermind looking ‘frail and anxious’ and slurring his words. He was . taken to hospital days after the show was recorded and said later: ‘My . throat specialist feared I had cancer. I spent three weeks in agony in . hospital. It turned out I had a virulent throat infection.’ In 2000, Smith revealed that he had conquered a seven-year addiction to over-the-counter painkillers. He said he downed handfuls of the drug . Nurofen Plus ‘like Smarties’ after developing gout which spread from . his feet to his wrists, elbows and knees, causing excruciating pain. ‘It was my dark secret and I got deeply depressed,’ he said then. ‘I didn’t dare tell a soul. Like an . alcoholic hiding his bottles, I started hiding my Nurofen tablets in the . backs of drawers, behind books on bookshelves and slipped them between . scripts. It was all terribly grubby. ‘They didn’t make me feel high. They just helped me relax.’ Double act: Mel Smith with his long-term collaborator Griff Rhys Jones . Family: The comedian had been married to former model Pam for 24 years . Shock: Mel, pictured with his wife Pam in 2005, had been battling ill health for some time . On one occasion he swallowed 50 . tablets – more than eight times the recommended daily dose – and had to . be admitted to hospital. Tests revealed he had two stomach . ulcers which had been ‘dripping’ blood, leaving him anaemic. He said: . ‘When my doctor found out how many pills I’d taken he told me, “You . might as well of put a gun to your head”. I am very lucky to be alive.’ That realisation finally made him quit the tablets. At the start of his addiction, Smith . was also depressed that his career as a director seemed to be stalling, . despite his film Bean having taken £100 million at the box office. ‘It’s frightening how I became hooked . on a prescription drug which is freely sold over the counter at any high . street chemist,’ he said. The son of a bookmaker, Smith went to . Oxford before beginning his career as an assistant director at the Royal . Court Theatre in London, joining Not The Nine O’Clock News in 1979. BBC Director General Tony Hall said: . ‘Mel Smith’s contribution to British comedy cannot be overstated. On . screen he helped to define a new style of comedy from the late 1970s . that continues to influence people to this day. His pioneering TV work . with Griff Rhys Jones through their company Talkback has created many of . the defining comedy shows of recent decades.’ Tributes: Mel Smith's friend Peter Fincham described him as an 'extraordinary natural talent'","Not The Nine O'Clock News star had been ill for some time, friends say .

"A television advert for E45 cream – featuring a young woman talking about her addiction problems – has been accused of trivialising drug abuse. Sixty viewers have complained to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) about the ‘offensive’ campaign for the popular moisturiser – which parodies an interview with a drug addict. The advert features a thin, pale-looking woman sitting on a chair in a darkened basement rubbing her arms anxiously. Bad taste: The new E45 advert has been pulled after getting complaints as it parodied drug addiction, as the girl confesses that she is 'hooked' on it . At the beginning of the 40-second commercial she says: ‘It all started with a small dose. All my friends were using it. I immediately liked it and wanted more. ‘It became a routine. It affected how I looked and how I felt. I couldn’t stop thinking about it.’ The advert plugs the moisturiser which has been praised by former X Factor star Cheryl Cole. In the last seconds of the film the model, who appears to be struggling with her addiction, then livens up and begins talking about the product – which is the biggest-selling of its kind in Britain. She is shown applying it to her arms, before saying: ‘It was the perfect daily moisturiser. It’s so light and smells great .  .  . I was hooked.’ The last shot shows samples of the cream, which retails for about £5.49, and the slogan: ‘You’ll be hooked.’ Trivial: Viewers complained about the advert as being 'offensive' to people struggling with addiction . Last night, critics branded the campaign ‘offensive’. Ken Stringer, chief executive of the charity Alliance, which is a support group for addicts, said: ‘It certainly trivialises the issue of addiction and people who are struggling to overcome their addiction. It is exploitative because it relies heavily on a stereotype of people in recovery.’ Vivienne Pattison, director of the viewers’ campaign group Mediwatch-UK, said: ‘I can imagine people might find it offensive.’ Bestseller: E45 body lotion is a market leader . TV viewers also complained on Twitter and Facebook. One tweeted: ‘What completely misjudged, misguided ad content from E45 cream.’ Another added: ‘Comparing moisturising lotion to serious drug addiction? Big NO.’ An ASA spokesman confirmed 60 complaints had been received. He said: ‘We will look at the advert to see if there appear to be problems under the advertising code.’ Reckitt Benckiser, the British company that manufactures the cream, was last night unavailable for comment.","Advert features a thin, pale-looking woman talking about being 'hooked'

"Andrew Marr has been accused of a ‘cavalier and unsympathetic’ attitude towards Christianity after failing to include Jesus in a landmark BBC television history of the world. Christians, including Lord Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, say the BBC is guilty of ‘a glaring oversight’ for excluding Christ from the series. Lord Carey said: ‘Any historical enquiry worth its salt takes seriously the life and ministry of Jesus when considering the impact of the Christian faith on world history. Lavish: Mehmed II conquers Constantinople in the BBC production (pictured) ‘This glaring oversight confirms a widely-held suspicion that the BBC tends to be cavalier and unsympathetic in its treatment of Christianity.’ The new eight-part series –  presented and written by Mr Marr – contains only a handful of references to Jesus and makes no attempt to tell the story of his life or to explain his teachings. In coming weeks Mr Marr will visit more than 60 historic locations but none has any association with Jesus’s life and death. The omission of such a pivotal figure from the series, which is a co-production with the Open University, is in stark contrast to the treatment of other faith leaders. In tonight’s episode, Mr Marr visits the Indian town of Bodh Gaya, a place of pilgrimage for Buddhists, to explain the origins of that particular faith. And next week, he tells the story of the Indian warrior Ashoka, who converted to Buddhism and helped spread the faith. The series has been written by Andrew Marr (pictured) The rest of the series charts history to the present day, focusing on figures from the conqueror of Constantinople, Ottoman leader Mehmed II, to Adolf Hitler. The series does not sideline Christianity but instead chooses to begin its history of the faith after Christ’s death in AD36. It provides an outline of the conversion of St Paul and recreates the death of the female martyr Perpetua in 203 AD. Bishop Michael Nazir Ali, the former Bishop of Rochester, said he could not see how the BBC could justify the ‘crucial omission’ of such a ‘central figure’ in human history. He said: ‘In the series Andrew Marr notes there are two billion Christians in the world, but does not say why. It would have been good to know.’ Last night, Mr Marr said: ‘I have absolutely no doubt that Jesus was a historical figure. I am sure that of all the great founders of the world religions he is the most historical. ‘But part of the problem we face is striking that balance between stories everyone knows and giving people stories they do not know so well.’ Mr Marr said the programme had decided to begin its history of Christianity with St Paul as he had been crucial to the transformation of Christianity into a major religion. A BBC spokesman said: ‘Andrew Marr’s History Of The World is not a religious programme nor a history of religion. The series tells the story of the evolution of civilisation.’","Christians say the BBC is guilty of 'a glaring oversight' for excluding Christ .

"BBC radio DJ Liz Kershaw has been named as the woman alleged to have made threatening phone calls to a male colleague who committed suicide last month. Detectives last week launched an inquiry to help the coroner discover why Russell Joslin, 50, suffocated himself. His family claim he was driven to his death after BBC bosses failed to take seriously allegations that he had been offended by a female colleague five years ago. Claims: Russel Joslin's father Peter alleges that BBC DJ Liz Kershaw made threatening calls to his son . However The Mail on Sunday has been unable to substantiate these allegations. The identity of the woman has so far remained a secret and Ms Kershaw has not responded to repeated requests from The Mail on Sunday to talk about the matter. But both sources at the BBC and Mr Joslin’s father, a former chief constable, have identified Ms Kershaw as the woman linked to the Warwickshire police investigation. The news adds to the pressure on the BBC. Ms Kershaw, now a DJ on BBC digital station 6 Music, recently claimed she was routinely groped by male colleagues when she worked at Radio 1 in the Eighties. She spoke out in the wake of revelations about Jimmy Savile. Mr Joslin, who as a reporter at BBC . Coventry and Warwickshire, is believed to have received a series of . phone messages from Ms Kershaw after they argued during a meal out . together in 2007 and he apparently walked out on her in a restaurant, . leaving her to find her own way back to Coventry. The phone messages . branded him a ‘flake’ and ‘a loser’. Distressed: BBC broadcast journalist Russell Joslin suffocated himself . Ms Kershaw, now 54, worked at BBC Coventry and Warwickshire between 2005 and 2011. While there is no evidence that the . messages contributed to the death of Mr Joslin, who was being treated in . a psychiatric hospital when he died, his family claim that he was left . ‘a shadow of his former self’ because he felt bosses failed to act on . his complaints. The BBC has launched an investigation, but the family are demanding a fully independent inquiry. Mr Joslin’s father Peter, 77, the . retired chief constable of Warwickshire, said last night: ‘When Liz . Kershaw joined BBC Coventry and Warwickshire she did not know the area . and for some reason Russell was chosen to show her around. ‘He quite enjoyed it, I think, until this particular incident but after that life became very tough for him. ‘We have the recordings of what she . said to him. Russell, being a good reporter, actually recorded the . messages as they were being left. ‘They were very unpleasant and she . made it clear that she felt she was on a different level to him.  A lot . of things happened because he had to carry on working with her. He did . not tell us everything but it badly affected him. ‘He was contracted to read the news . on her show and told some of his friends about how she had cut him off . and that sort of thing. It changed the way he felt about the BBC.’ Peter Joslin, who led the . Warwickshire force for 15 years, added: ‘He had a bad episode earlier in . the year. We thought he had recovered, but after a discussion with . senior people at the BBC he thought there was no hope of obtaining . justice. A few days later he killed himself. ‘The discussion between Russell and . the BBC happened a week before he died. I don’t know what part the Jimmy . Savile business played in Russell’s mind but he followed the news. ‘Russell was a character, the last . person many of his friends would have thought this would happen to.  But . he was a reporter to the end and this is the last story for him. His . last act was to make sure people knew the reason. He did not leave a . letter but there are so many ways of getting your message out these . days. ‘Until now, I have felt sick in the stomach because nobody was allowed to say who it was that Russell had been talking about.’ When asked if he had given Liz . Kershaw’s name to police, Mr Joslin  replied: ‘We did speak to the . police about this in the early stages. I know they have all the facts . and the names of those involved. ’ Russell is though to have spoken to . the BBC occupational health department about the case this spring, when . he was off work with stress. According to reports, one of the . phone messages sent to Mr Joslin said: ‘Thanks for abandoning me. Don’t . ever ever think of me as your mate again. Do what you have to at the BBC . cause you are a loser on 27 grand a year. But don’t ever encroach on me . or my talent.’ Another message said: ‘You are flaky, . you are poor, you are weak. I don’t want anything to do with you except . on the radio. Goodbye.’ A third said: ‘Don’t ever, ever presume friendship with me again, all right? Goodbye.’ The allegation that Ms Kershaw,  made . the calls to Mr Joslin came after she claimed last month there was a . culture of sexual harassment of women at Radio 1 and that she was groped . while broadcasting live. Ms Kershaw, who worked for Radio 1 in . the Eighties, met BBC director-general George Entwistle after she . claimed on Radio 4’s Today programme that an unidentified male colleague . had repeatedly stroked her breasts while she was on air. Anger: Russell Joslin's father ex police chief Peter Joslin has blamed Corporation bosses for failing to stop his death . She said: ‘There was a reporter who . routinely groped me. I would be sitting in the studio with my headphones . on and my back to the studio door. I couldn’t say anything, I couldn’t . even explain because I was broadcasting to the nation.’ A BBC spokesman refused to be drawn on Ms Kershaw’s involvement in the matter. He said: ‘It would be inappropriate . to comment on names or specific details until all the facts are known . but the BBC is committed to working constructively with the family to . ensure that their concerns are vigorously addressed. ‘What we can say is that we are . undertaking an investigation overseen by an external professional to . establish the facts about how any complaints made by Russell were . reported and how the BBC acted on them. We will also co-operate fully . with the coroner’s inquest which is charged with determining the cause . of Russell’s death and will consider its findings carefully’. When approached by The Mail on Sunday yesterday Ms Kershaw declined to comment.","Broadcast journalist Russell Joslin suffocated himself last month .

"It has been blighted by controversy in recent years but the Grand National triumphed yesterday – thanks to a triple whammy of a surprise winner, blazing sunshine and no fatalities. Sue Smith, the wife of flamboyant showjumping champion Harvey Smith, had the most to celebrate after she became only the third female trainer in history to win Britain’s most popular race. Her horse Auroras Encore was piloted home by Ryan Mania at odds of 66-1, winning in front of a 70,000 sell-out crowd by nine lengths and a nose ahead of Cappa Bleu in second place and Teaforthree in third. Upset: Ryan Mania, riding Auroras Encore, clears the last to win the Grand National in front of a sell-out crowd of 70,000 . On the way to victory: Auroras Encore, centre, goes over the jump just behind the leaders on the way to winning the Grand National . By JONATHAN PETRE . She was absent from Ladies’ Day for the first time in ten years, but Coleen Rooney was not going to miss the big race yesterday – despite being heavily pregnant. The wife of Manchester United star Wayne arrived at Aintree for the Grand National in a black maternity dress with lace detail and a pair of precarious red high heels. While Wayne was preparing for a clash with rivals Manchester City tomorrow, Coleen watched the race with three-year-old son Kai. Also dressed in black was singer Katherine Jenkins, who took to the track to perform the National Anthem. The theme of figure-hugging black numbers was continued by The Only Way Is Essex stars Cara Kilbey and Billi Mucklow and ex-Brookside actress Claire Sweeney. Other racegoers, however, preferred more flamboyant outfits, including a trio of Union Jack-clad singers. Nearly all racegoers made an effort for the glamorous day, with girls donning elaborate hats, colourful dresses and towering heels. A delighted Mrs Smith said: ‘Its . unbelievable, Ryan gave him such a good ride. I knew the ground was . right for him and hoped everything else was. He stayed down the middle . and had a bit of luck in running. He didn’t have a lot of weight and . that helped, too. He’s such a grand little horse.’ Harvey Smith, 74, who famously gave a . V-sign to judges in the 1971 British Show Jumping Derby, last night said . he had been dreaming of the triumph for 65 years. He said: ‘It’s the best of my life. It’s the best because this is the present. Let’s hope there is more to . come. I’m going to enjoy this because I won’t have many more moments . like it. I’ll be 6ft under in a box soon. ‘When I was a boy I fell off my bike . and broke my wrist – and they gave me gas when they operated to fix it. In those days they used to put a bowl next to you to be sick in. ‘But I put that bowl on my head and I . was cheering. “What are you doing?” they asked me. I told them: “I’ve . just won the Grand National.” It’s taken me 65 years to do it.’ The former show-jumper also blasted . critics of the race. He said: ‘The doubters were rubbish. There are too . many wimps in this country. It’s onwards and upwards for the Grand . National.’ Smith declined to do a repeat of his V-sign sign and said: ‘No. That V-sign stuff is all in the past.’ The family’s triumph was an even greater surprise because it was the first time jockey Mania, 24, had taken part.

Britain’s bookmakers, who had been taking an average of 9,000 online and . mobile phone bets per minute, their best Grand National result in . living memory. David Williams of Ladbrokes said: . ‘The winner seemed to slip off every radar. We thought Mon Mome’s . victory at 100-1 a few years ago was superb but this was every bit as . good.’ It is believed punters staked more than £150 million on the race.

"Two former female employees of Goldman Sachs are seeking class action status for their lawsuit accusing the New York-based bank of widespread gender discrimination and creating a 'boy's club' atmosphere of binge drinking and visits to strip clubs. H Cristina Chen-Oster and Shanna Orlich petitioned a Manhattan federal judge today to let them sue Goldman on behalf of current and former female associates and vice presidents. They said in a filing that they have statements by former Goldman employees, expert statistical analyses and evidence of earnings and promotions from the firm's records to support their claims. H. Cristina Chen-Oster, right, and Shana Orlich at their lawyer's office in New York in 2010. The women asked a federal judge today to let them turn their lawsuit against Goldman Sachs into a class action. They accuse the bank of creating a 'boy's club' atmosphere of binge drinking and strip clubs . Goldman Sachs is accused of creating a culture where women are either 'sexualized or ignored.' Pictured here is Goldman Sachs Tower in Jersey City, New Jersey . 'Women report a ""boy's club"" atmosphere, where binge drinking is common and women are either sexualized or ignored,' the filing states. Ms Chen-Oster and Ms Orlich sued Goldman back in 2010 for unspecified damages and an order requiring the firm to fix the alleged gender bias. With today's filing, they hope broaden their case to include more than a decade of claimed discrimination at the firm, Bloomberg News reported. Goldman Sachs has denied their claims and is fighting the lawsuit. 'This is a normal and anticipated . procedural step for any proposed class action lawsuit and does not . change the case’s lack of merit,' spokesman David Wells said today in an e-mailed statement. Edith Cooper, global head of human capital management for Goldman Sachs, is the only woman among the firm's 10 executive officers. She's shown here during a Bloomberg Television interview in 2012 . In it the suit, the two claimed female vice presidents earned 21 per cent less than men and female associates 8 per cent less. They also said Goldman promoted 23 per cent fewer female vice presidents to managing director relative to their male counterparts. Edith Cooper, global head of human . capital management at Goldman, is the only woman among the firm's 10 . executive officers. She was named the 26th most powerful woman in New . York by Crain's New York Business in 2013. Goldman didn't elevate a woman to partner until 1986, according to Forbes, 117 years after it was founded. Denise Shelley, a former vice president at Goldman who left the firm in 2009, said in a separate court filing that men at the bank repeatedly called women 'bimbos', mocked a new employee who won a beauty pageant and took clients to strip clubs. Ms Shelley, who sat on the steering committee of Goldman's network for women, said in the filing that she was called a 'party girl' by a managing director after joining colleagues at a bar. Ms Chen-Oster and Ms Orlich are asking U.S. District Judge Analisa Tores to certify a class of female associaties and vice presidents who worked for Goldman in its investment banking, investment management and securities divisions beginning September 10, 2004. The case is Chen-Oster v. Goldman Sachs & Co., 10-cv-06950, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

"A Florida jury has swiftly convicted a violent pimp who preyed on beautiful Australian, New Zealand and US women and turned them into high-end prostitutes. The jury of seven women and five men in the US District Court in Miami took just six hours after a two-week trial to find Jamaican-born Damion St Patrick Baston guilty of all 21 charges, including sex trafficking and money laundering. The 37-year-old former nightclub dancer, music producer and self-described entrepreneur faces life in prison at his sentencing on September 5, with a minimum mandatory sentence of 15 years. Jamaican-born Damion St Patrick Baston, 37, was found guilty of sex trafficking and money laundering after he preyed on Australian, New Zealand and US women and turned them into high-end prostitutes . ""It did not turn out the way Mr Baston wanted,"" Baston's lawyer, David Rowe, told AAP. ""He took it in a manly way."" US prosecutors flew in two Australian women and one New Zealander to testify alongside three Americans who were turned into sex slaves by Baston. Baston beat, threatened and raped his victims, bragged about being a member of violent LA street gang the Bloods, and then kept for himself the hundreds of thousands of dollars the women made. Baston's pimping began on Queensland's Gold Coast, but led to the Middle East and the US. In 2011 Baston, posing as a music producer looking for talent in Australia, met an Australian woman, known as KL, in a Gold Coast restaurant. They began a romantic relationship and the woman believed they would open a restaurant together, but he began using violence and the threats of violence to coerce her into prostitution. Baston drove KL to prostitution dates, posted her photographs and contact information on local escorting websites and newspapers and collected all of her earnings. She had to refer to him as ""Daddy"". KL would return home with ""thousands of dollars"", Baston would keep it and flaunt it, including posting Instagram photos of his $250,000 bank balance and $75,000 diamond-studded watch. In 2011 Baston took KL to Dubai where she made large sums of cash as a prostitute and then they travelled to Miami, Florida, where he continued to pimp her. The other Australian victim, TJM, met Baston at a party in Queensland in 2009 when she was 18 and they married in an Islamic ceremony in 2010. In 2011 he was prostituting TJM and KL together out of several rental properties on the Gold Coast. Mr Rowe told the jury KL was not the victim, but the ""business genius"" behind a Gold Coast escort agency known as Bachelors Club and Baston ""was basically the security guard to make sure that the girls did not get assaulted"". Baston was arrested in New York in December after KL flew from the US to Australia to renew her visa and her relatives alerted the US State Department. In 2010, a 21-year-old Lithuanian woman, known as GP, told NSW police Baston had hung her by her feet over a fire escape, forced her to remain in a scalding shower for several hours and beat her relentlessly. ""According to the sexual battery detective who interviewed GP that night, GP was the most terrified victim she had ever encountered in her 25 years at the police department,"" prosecutors said. Baston remains in custody. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Jamaican-born Damion St Patrick Baston, 37, found guilty of sex trafficking .

"Oscar Pistorius is at risk of committing suicide unless he receives further treatment, according to a psychologist’s report prepared for his murder trial. The report said the double-amputee runner is suffering depression and post-traumatic stress disorder and 'his condition is likely to worsen' if professional treatment for those conditions is halted. It also concluded that the Paralympian does not show narcissistic traits linked with violence towards women and 'rage-type' murders. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Trial: Oscar Pistorius' agent Peet van Zyl has given evidence once again. Pictured is the Paralympian arriving at court on Wednesday . Murder trial: Oscar Pistorius is hugged by a supporter  on Wednesday . Dr. Jonathan Scholtz, a clinical psychologist, found no evidence that Pistorius had a history of 'abnormal aggression or explosive violence' but concluded he has a record of feeling insecure and vulnerable, particularly when he is without his prosthetic limbs, defense lawyer Barry Roux said. Roux on Wednesday read excerpts from the report, which was compiled during a 30-day observation period at a state psychiatric hospital and included a report compiled by three psychiatrists. Oscar Pistorius is accused of murdering girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, who he shot dead through the bathroom door of his home last year. Pistorius maintains he shot her by accident, believing her to be an intruder. The court-ordered evaluation occurred after a psychiatrist testifying for the defense said Pistorius was suffering from an anxiety disorder that may have influenced his actions on the night he killed Steenkamp. Another excerpt read out from the report stated that the reaction Pistorius had on the night he killed Ms Steenkamp might seem 'seem extraordinary when viewed from the perspective of an able-bodied person, but normal in the context of a disabled person with his history'. At times during his trial, Pistorius has wailed and retched in apparent distress, particularly during graphic testimony about the shooting and also when the athlete was on the witness stand. At other times, he has been calm and taken notes. Chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel has suggested Pistorius feigned distress in order to dodge a tough cross-examination; the athlete's camp has denied his emotional displays were fake. The defence called their last witness today, sports and exercise expert Professor Wayne Derman from the University of Cape Town. He told the court that Pistorius, who he has treated, was 'hyper-vigilant'. He said he would constantly scan rooms for possible threats when out in public, and even look around his treatment room during one-to-one consultations in an agitated manner. He quoted a study that found that adults with disabilities are at a higher risk of violent attacks. He added that the athlete has a hand tremor as well as a sleep disorder that required medication. The defence is trying to bolster the idea that the Paralympian's purported fear of crime may have pushed him to fire through a closed toilet door and that his disability contributed to an increased sense of vulnerability. Pistorius’ manager Peet van Zyl was cross-examined again today, stressing that he had nothing to gain financially from being biased towards Pistorius as his contract with him has ended. Hearing: Oscar Pistorius faces 25 years in jail if found guilty of premeditated murder . Yesterday he told the court how Oscar Pistorius had a heightened concern for his personal safety and was making plans to take girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp on international trips shortly before he fatally shot her. The defense called Peet van Zyl to the stand in an attempt to bolster Pistorius' account that he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder, providing testimony about a loving relationship and a fear of crime that may have pushed the Paralympian to fire through a closed toilet door. Van Zyl faced tough questioning from the chief prosecutor, however, about Pistorius' alleged egotism and tantrums, high-speed driving and love of guns. The prosecution maintains that he intentionally killed Steenkamp in his home after an argument in the early hours of February 14, 2013. Pistorius, who is free on bail, faces 25 years to life in prison if found guilty of premeditated murder, but he could also be sentenced to significant time behind bars if convicted of murder without premeditation or negligent killing. He also faces gun-related charges. The agent, who helped guide Pistorius to success as a globally renowned athlete with lucrative sponsorship deals that have since been stripped away, testified that his client had a 'heightened sense of awareness' and appeared preoccupied with security at times. On one occasion, he recalled, Pistorius drove with him at high speed to the airport and, when told there was no rush, recalled a traumatic episode in which Van Zyl was accosted at gunpoint while in his car in 2007. 'He wanted to ensure that we are safe and not being followed,' Van Zyl said. He also remembered a time when Pistorius grabbed him by the arm in apparent fear when the pair heard a loud bang while walking in New York City, and described two occasions in which the runner lost his temper but was not aggressive under 'abusive questioning' from journalists. Pause in proceedings: Oscar Pistorius pictured hugging someone as the court breaks for lunch on Wednesday . He also said he was assisting Pistorius in plans to take Steenkamp, a 29-year-old model, to races in Britain and Brazil, and a concert in Italy. Prosecutor Gerrie Nel tried to pick holes in Van Zyl's testimony, pressing the agent for details about a reported incident in which a South African athlete who was sharing a room with Pistorius asked for them to be separated because Pistorius was allegedly arguing frequently on his telephone. He also referred to a 2012 Paralympics race in which Pistorius accused the winner of breaking the rules by using prosthetic limbs that were too long. Van Zul acknowledged that it was the 'wrong place and wrong time for him to react in such a way' but noted there was a 'long lead-up' to the incident in which Pistorius had expressed concerns that rules were being flouted. Nel also described Pistorius' plans to take Steenkamp on trips as an example of alleged narcissism after Van Zyl quoted the athlete as saying he wanted his girlfriend 'to see what my world is about, the pressure that I'm under' and 'how I need to perform.' During an adjournment, Van Zyl and Pistorius shook hands. The two men patted each other warmly on the back.","Psychologist report says Pistorius might kill himself without treatment .

"Disgraced rugby star Ian Gough  wore a customised scrum cap in support of a fathers' rights campaign group during a match following claims that he only has limited access to his son. He said that he wore the Spriderman scrum cap, which was printed with his son's initials, to back New Fathers 4 Justice - whose supporters have staged protests dressed as superheroes. The former Wales international has claimed that he does not have enough access to the son he had with former Playboy model Sophia Cahill, whom he was convicted of assaulting earlier this year. Protest: Disgraced rugby star Ian Gough, left, has previously claimed that he only has limited access to the child he had with former Playboy model Sophia Cahill, pictured right . Customised: The player was disciplined by the governing body over the cap, pictured. Rugby chiefs said that the cap, which was printed with the letters NF4J and his son's initial, breached 'commercial rules' The 37-year-old wore the cap while playing for the Newport Dragons in a rugby union match in Llanelli, West Wales, earlier this month. But following the televised game, rugby chiefs served him with a written warning claiming he had breached 'commercial rules' because the cap also had the letters NF4J - which stands for New Fathers 4 Justice - on it. Gough said: 'I'm pretty disappointed with the decision made by the governing body. 'However I do realise after it being pointed out that it conflicted with the rules concerning advertising. 'I take this on board and accept their decisions.' Ms Cahill, who was crowned Ms Wales in 2000, split up with Gough in 2011 while she was still pregnant with their child. Ms Cahill, pictured, who was crowned Ms Wales in 2000, split up with Gough in 2011 while she was still pregnant with their child . She became engaged to former pop star Dane Bowers in December last year. Gough was convicted of assaulting Ms Cahill as he dropped off their young son outside the home she shares with Mr Bowers in south London in January. The rugby player, who is 6ft 5in and weighs nearly 19 stone, was said to have 'manhandled and shoved' the mother of his child, after arriving an hour late to leave the youngest in her and Mr Bowers' care. Gough, who made 64 appearances for Wales, was convicted of assault and was ordered to pay £2,130 in fines and costs. It is the second time this year that the rugby player has been pictured wearing a customised scrum cap. In May this year, Gough wore another cap printed with NF4J during a game in May. At the time, he  said he pulled the stunt in support of the campaign group to highlight the plight of fathers who are refused access to their children by the courts. After the match he said: 'I did this for all the fathers and grandparents who get little or no access to see their children. 'In my experience over the last year fathers have no rights regarding contact with their children. It is not wrong for fathers to campaign for equality and more rights. Those that do should be supported. 'Good loving fathers should have an automatic right to see their children and not have to go through a protracted court battle. 'When parents split up they should put aside their differences and share their children.' New Fathers 4 Justice welcomed his support saying 'Ian is a known supporter of fathers' rights'. A spokesman for the Pro12 league game said: 'No logos, messages or advertising may be displayed on player's kit at matches save for the club logo, the kit manufacturer's logo and messages promoting club sponsors.'","Ian Gough wore Superman scrum cap, customised with his son's initials .

"New research has indicated that Australian sports are sending out an unhealthy message through the vast majority of its sponsors which produce unhealthy products. Research conducted by Rona Macniven from the University of Sydney has revealed that 39 sports organisations, out of the 53 which are supported by the Australian Sports Commission, have at least one sponsor that distributes unhealthy commodities, Fairfax reports. The results of the audit, which were presented at a conference organised by Sports Medicine Australia on Wednesday, revealed that cricket was the worst offender. Research conducted by Rona Macniven from the University of Sydney found that cricket  was the sport with the most amount of 'unhealthy' sponsors . Represented by Cricket Australia, the sport was revealed to have 19 fast food companies as sponsors including KFC and Coca Cola, 10 alcohol manufacturers including VB and Carlton, and one gambling operator, Bet365. The audit concludes that more than a quarter of its sponsors are made up of these unhealthy companies. But despite Ms Macniven dubbing unhealthy sponsorships in sport 'a paradox', Cricket Australia has defended its alcohol company sponsors by arguing that removing them would be a 'simplistic approach'. The audit found that 39 sports organisations, out of the 53 which are supported by the Australian Sports Commission, have at least one sponsor that distributes unhealthy products . 'Our research shows that it is better to engage with the reality that most fans enjoy a responsible drink than it is to turn them off with a prohibition message that they don't believe' a spokesperson told the Sydney Morning Herald. But can the same 'responsible' intake level be suggested by AFL team the Western Sydney Wanderers, whose recently announced partnership with McDonald's raised eyebrows on Wednesday? Part of the agreement will see the fast food giant offer a $9.95 Wanderers meal deal to customers that presents them with an intake of 6480kj – a quarter pounder, large soft drink and fires and six McNuggets. Most recently, AFL team the Western Sydney Wanderers recently announced their partnership with McDonald's which will see the release of the Wanderers meal deal . AFL and Rugby League took out the second prize for the highest number of unhealthy sponsors, according to the audit.

"A man accused of beheading a grandmother with a machete in her back garden has refused to appear via video link at the Old Bailey. Nicholas Salvadore, 25, is alleged to have killed Palmira Silva, 82, in the garden of her home in Edmonton, north London, last Thursday. Today he declined to appear at a first Crown Court hearing via video link from Belmarsh prison in south east London. Nicholas Salvadore (left) has been charged with murdering pensioner Palmira Silva (pictured right) and assaulting a police officer . Defence lawyer Bernard Richmond, QC, told the court: 'I am instructed that he does not wish to come into the video link room even with his legal team. He wants to be present in court. ‘He wants to be present - that’s the position.’ Unemployed Salvadore, of Enfield, north London, is charged with murdering Mrs Silva and assaulting a police officer, PC Bernie Hamilton. He has not yet entered pleas to either of the charges. No application was made for bail and Judge Brian Barker QC, the Recorder of London, remanded Salvadore in custody until a plea and case management hearing on November 25. He added: ‘I hope he will co-operate with the defence team in the future.' Mrs Silva reportedly moved to London from her native Italy with her husband Domenico six decades ago. They married and had a daughter, Celestina, and a son, Rino. Prosecutor Jonathan Rees, QC, said Mrs Silva was ‘subjected to a brutal assault, struck repeatedly to the back of the head with a wooden pole, causing it to break.' He added: ‘She was stabbed with a machete to her torso. At this point she effectively collapsed to the floor, partially inside her back door.’ An array of floral tributes were left outside the family's restaurant, Silva's Cafe, in Church Street, near Edmonton Green station, after last week's attack. Flowers and tributes were left outside Mrs Silva's family cafe in the wake of the attack . Officers pictured working at the home of Mrs Silva last Friday, the day after she was attacked in her garden . The first 999 call was made at 1.07pm on Thursday afternoon and Salvadore was arrested at 1.45pm, the court heard. Salvadore, who is a former pupil at Nightingale Academy secondary school, is then accused of assaulting PC Hamilton during his arrest. The former labourer was shot with a Taser by armed police who arrested him that afternoon close to the scene of the attack. He was treated in hospital prior to being charged the following day.

"The EU also plans to target other high-powered devices from next spring . Shoppers criticised the ban on powerful vacuum cleaners at the weekend as they hoovered up the last models on sale. A European Union directive banning cleaners of more than 1,600 watts comes into force today in an attempt to reduce energy use. It is a blow to families and pet owners who value powerful vacuums for making house cleaning quick and easy. The EU also plans to target other high-powered devices from next spring. It has conducted a study which suggests there could be 30 per cent energy savings on hairdryers, smartphones and lawnmowers. Scroll down for video . A European Union directive banning cleaners of more than 1,600 watts comes into force today in an attempt to reduce energy use . Hairdressers have come out against banning powerful hairdryers, saying it will upset clients and less powerful dryers would be used for longer – using more electricity. Mark Coray, from the National Hairdressers Federation, told the BBC: ‘It’s ludicrous. If you’re reducing the power it’s taking longer so the client is unhappy, but if you’re reducing the power you’re holding the dryer for longer so they’re using the same amount of energy anyway.’ Kettle manufacturers could be told to make their products consume less energy by switching off ten seconds earlier, and by redesigning to reduce ‘surface heat loss’. The final decision on which products to target will be made next year. The EU ruling bans the import or manufacture of vacuum cleaners over 1,600 watts from today, although stores will still be able to sell their remaining stock. Popular models by Hoover, Samsung and Vax, which will be affected by the ban, had already sold out online last week at Currys and Tesco. Tesco had exhausted stocks of the 2,300-watt Hoover Breeze BR2306 and 2,000-watt Hoover SM2018 Pets cleaners, while Currys had sold out of models including the 2,100-watt Cyclone Force Sensor. At the weekend some shoppers said they had found out about the ruling only at the last minute. Nick Haydon, 30, who has just bought his first home in Cannock, Staffordshire, said: ‘I was just about to get the keys when I saw about the high-powered vacuums being banned. I panicked and wanted a powerful one so went to John Lewis to try to avoid disappointment. ‘I can’t believe they’re banning them, it doesn’t make any sense.’ Hairdressers have come out against banning powerful hairdryers, saying it will upset clients and less powerful dryers would be used for longer - using more electricity (stock picture) June Clarke, 60, shopping in Birmingham city centre, said: ‘The powerful models are the only ones which can get the house properly clean. I’ve just bought a Samsung Cyclone Force Sensor. I think the new rules are ridiculous.’ Some stores were allowing shoppers to buy by phone to collect at a later date. Other stores said weekend trading had been normal – but Tesco has reported an increase of nearly 44 per cent in sales of 2,000-watt cleaners in the past fortnight, while the Co-op’s sales rose by 38 per cent. Today’s ban on cleaners over 1,600 watts will be followed by a further reduction to 900 watts from 2017. The average vacuum is currently 1,800 watts, and lower power has previously meant less suction. But Sir James Dyson said the change could force firms to invest in more efficient technology. He said: ‘Dyson has never made a vacuum cleaner of more than 1,400 watts because it is intelligent engineering that leads to high cleaning performance, not energy-thirsty motors.’ Dyson has reported a 78 per cent increase in cleaner sales since the news over energy labelling broke.","Directive banning cleaners of more than 1,600 watts comes into force today .

"A 24-year-old woman and her 46-year-old boyfriend got their 15-year-old babysitter high on party drug meow meow and then pressured him into sex, a court has heard. Nicola Mason from Rhydwyn in Holyhead, North Wales, stripped off in front of the boy and then forced him into a sex act while John Ford watched, it was claimed. The boy was embarrassed and initially refused the advances but prosecuting barrister Myles Wilson said he eventually gave in. Scroll down for video . Mold Crown Court heard that Nicola Mason (left) from Rhydwyn in Holyhead, North Wales, stripped off in front of the boy and then forced him into a sex act while John Ford watched (right), it was claimed . It was alleged that he was given the party drug to loosen his inhibitions. The couple each deny sex charges against the boy, who is now 16, and have accused him of 'making his story up out of thin air'. 'The prosecution case is that the first defendant Ford gave the 15-year-old male boy drugs and pressured him to have sex with his partner, the second defendant Mason,' Mr Wilson told the jury at Mold Crown Court. 'Both these defendants, in effect, took advantage of a 15-year-old lad who was a virgin at the time. He lost his virginity by being pressured into it, with John Ford looking on.' The first time was when the couple returned home after a night out. The boy was on the sofa and took the view that they were under the influence, or drugged up. Ford was alleged to have told the boy Mason 'was off her head' and 'you can do anything you like with her.' Mr Wilson said that the boy felt nervous and out of his depth but Ford told Mason to strip off, and she did in the front room. He claimed that Ford was persistent, almost taunting the boy, by saying 'you must be gay then' when he kept refusing the advances. Ford told the boy that his girlfriend Mason (pictured) was 'off her head' and he could do 'anything he wanted' with her . Eventually he said 'ok' and Mason undressed him, with Ford watching on it was alleged. The prosecutor claimed that Ford had also offered him some cannabis. The boy was at their home again two to three weeks later. 'It is important for you to realise that the prosecution case is not that he was forced completely into something that he was desperate to avoid. It is not as black and white as that,' Mr Wilson told the jury. 'The prosecution case is that he was under age and he was taken advantage of by grown adults who quite frankly should have known better. He was just 15.' On the second occasion, he alleged that the defendants did not waste any time whatsoever. When he arrived it was claimed that Ford took him upstairs to the main bedroom where Mason appeared naked. She got onto the bed and it was alleged that Ford told the boy 'that's your bitch' and 'you can do anything you want.' Initially the boy said no, he did not want to go through with it, particularly in front of Ford. But Mr Wilson claimed that Ford would not take no for an answer. So the youngster ended up having sex in front of Ford with Mason on the bed, it was alleged. On this occasion, it was alleged that Ford had given him the illegal party drug MCAT. 'The prosecution say that what makes this worse is that Ford gave the boy drugs no doubt to try and gain his trust or loosen his inhibitions,'  Mr Wilson told the jury. 'It is the prosecution case that the defendants liked to involve other people in their sex lives,' he added. 'There will be evidence from other witnesses including a good friend of Ford that this is something they did, that Ford would encourage and let other men have sex with Mason,' he claimed. The matter came out when the boy told his older brother. A woman who was looking after him at the time then heard about it and went with a friend to confront Mason. The prosecution alleged that Mason broke down and admitted it had occurred, and claimed Ford had forced her into it. She spoke to Ford on the telephone, and was alleged to have said: 'It is too late John, I have told them, I have told them everything.' The witness listened on the phone and it was claimed that Ford, believing he was still speaking to Mason, said 'shut the f*** up Nicola' and 'you had better shut your mouth.' It was the prosecution case that a friend of Ford's had asked him about rumours he had heard and that Ford was alleged to have admitted to him that it took place. But arrested and interviewed, the both denied that any such thing had happened or that anything sexual had occurred with the boy. They now accused the boy of 'making it up out of thin air'. In evidence the boy denied that he was a street wise lad but agreed that he had given evidence in the crown court previously as a defendant in a case of perverting the course of justice. Ford denies two charges of inciting the child to engage with sexual activity with Mason and Mason denies two charges of sexual activity with a child. The trial continues.

"Before a new car can be allowed on the road, it must undergo vigorous testing to ensure it is safe both for its occupants and other cars and pedestrians. But Google wants to streamline this process by being allowed to test its upcoming driverless cars in virtual reality before they hit the roads. The company has apparently built a digital simulation of the Californian road system, and wants its cars to be certified based on their performance in this virtual world. Google wants officials to allow the company to test its cars in a virtual world before they hit real roads. The company has apparently developed a digital simulation that the cars can drive around in (3D mapping software of the cars shown) and test their abilities before they head out into the real world . Mean streets: Google cars have driven about 700,000 accident-free miles (1.1 million km) on motorways in 'autonomous mode'. Google has been focusing on city driving for the past year. To-do list: Google's Lexus RX450H SUVs are retrofitted with lasers, radar and cameras rapidly learned how to handle thousands of urban driving situations. Improvements are needed in merging and lane changes, turning right on red and handling bad weather. Local tests: So far, the tech giant has focused on street driving in Mountain View, California. The state, along with, Nevada, Florida, Michigan and Washington, D.C., have formally opened public streets to testing of self-driving cars. The future is (almost) here: In 2012, Google co-founder Sergey Brin predicted that the public would be able to get hold of the technology within five years. This prediction has not been revised. Google, the carmaker: While Google has enough money to invest in making cars, that likelihood is remote. Industry experts believe more likely options include collaborating with major car makers or giving away the software, as Google did with its Android operating system. The plans to lobby officials to allow the development were revealed by The Guardian. Google claims that testing in a virtual world is actually safer, as more eventualities can be accounted for. And ‘they allow manufacturers to test their software under far more conditions and stresses than could possibly be achieved on a test track,’ safety director Ron Medford reportedly wrote to California state officials earlier this year. The simulation is based on intricate mapping of 2,000 miles (3,200 km) of road in California. The car's software is then tasked with driving around this virtual world, which includes other cars and pedestrians to avoid. However, while the cars are adept at traversing this route, it is just a small part of the 172,000 miles (277,000 km) of road in the state alone. And even before Google begins similar mapping processes in other cities, it is yet to seek approval from California for their virtual reality testing idea. In addition, the system so far has only been used in the rather balmy and dry conditions in California. Their digital simulation has not yet been challenged with testing weather conditions such as, for example, a wet and windy day in the UK when more care must be taken when driving. Google's simulation is based on intricate mapping of 2,000 miles (3,200 km) of road in California. The car's software is then tasked with driving around this virtual world. However, while the cars (shown) are adept at traversing this route, it is just a small part of the 172,000 miles (277,000 km) of road in the state alone . The move follows the announcement that Google's self-driving cars will be designed to exceed maximum speed limits, in a move to improve safety. Dmitri Dolgov, the lead software engineer for the project, revealed the vehicles will go 10mph (16km) faster than the speed limit. The purpose is to avoid the Google car being significantly slower than speeding vehicles around it, which would increase the risk of an accident. Mr Dolgov said research showed that sticking to the speed limit when other cars are speeding can be dangerous. Therefore, the car’s speed would be altered depending on traffic conditions, Reuters reported. The same radar and camera system used for collision avoidance would be used to monitor the speed of other cars and match to them accordingly. There will be a limit, however, and if another car is dramatically speeding then Google's driverless car will go no faster. But Mr Dolgov did not elaborate on how the feature would work with speed cameras or mobile police, and whether it could incur a speeding fine. Google hopes the autonomous cars will drastically reduce accidents on the roads. The prototype two-seater cars have buttons to autonomously begin and end the drive. The car makes turns and react to other vehicles and pedestrians based on computer programs that predict what others might do, and data from sensors including radar and cameras that read in real time what other objects are actually doing. The route might be set by typing a destination into a map or using spoken commands according to Chris Urmson, the leader of Google's self-driving car team. The car will be powered by electricity and could go about 100 miles (160 km) before charging. Its shape suggests a rounded-out Volkswagen Beetle - something that might move people around a corporate campus or congested downtown - with headlights and sensors arrayed to resemble a friendly face. The front of the vehicle has a soft foam-like material where a traditional bumper would be and a more flexible windscreen, in a bid to be safer for pedestrians. In these prototypes speed is restricted to 25mph (40 km/h) and the ability to self-drive will depend on specifically designed Google road maps tested on the company’s current fleet of vehicles. Ultimately the vehicles will be faster and will be able to use Google's extended maps service. Driving works by using GPS technology to locate the vehicle’s exact position on an electronic map. A combination of radar, lasers and cameras sitting on top of the roof give the car a 360-degree ‘view’, with sensors linked to computer software able to ‘see’ and identify people, cars, road signs and markings and traffic lights.","Company says it has built detailed digital streets of California's roads .

"Cricket legend Geoffrey Boycott has revealed how he turned to Feng Shui to help him beat cancer. The famously blunt-speaking former England captain says he was ‘open to anything’ in his four-year fight against the killer disease after the discovery of a tumour in his neck. He enlisted the help of Master Li, a feng shui expert used by a friend - who advised him which direction he should sleep and identifying which areas of his house were most healthy. Scroll down for video . Cricket legend Geoffrey Boycott, who has revealed how he turned to Feng Shui to help him beat cancer . In his new book, The Corridor of Certainty, which is being serialised by the Daily Telegraph, Mr Boycott wrote: ‘I was open to anything, just trying to find things to help me stay alive,’ The 73-year-old said that on diagnosis, he was given just three months to live unless he embarked on a gruelling programme of chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment. He coped with the painful sessions following the 2002 diagnosis by thinking back to his cricketing days. ‘In one day cricket I used to count my runs, how many an over we needed to win and whether we were above or below the asking rate,’ he said. ‘I went about it in exactly the same way when I had treatment. I would count each and every one until we got to the halfway mark.’ The 73-year-old said that on diagnosis, he was given just three months to live unless he embarked on a gruelling programme of chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment . Side effects from the chemotherapy included destruction of Mr Boycott’s taste buds, which took 12 months to recover, and his immune system, which only returned to normal two years later. Describing an appointment with his consultant at which he was given the all clear, he said: ‘ Sitting there waiting for the verdict is like waiting for the umpire to put up his finger or say not out. I was lucky she never said not out.’ Mr Boycott added that his battle against cancer changed him as a person, ‘softening’ some of his edges and helping him become less angry.","Former captain says he was 'open to anything' in fight against cancer .

"The taxman will soon be taking more money from financially prudent savers, homebuyers and shareholders than from duty collected on alcohol and cigarettes. By the end of the next financial year, the amount raised from inheritance tax, stamp duty land tax and stamp duty on shares is forecast to reach £21.9billion, according to Treasury figures. This contrasts with £21billion set to be raised from ‘sin’ taxes on tobacco, wine, beer and cider. Cigarettes and beer: The taxman will soon be taking more money from financially prudent savers, homebuyers and shareholders than from duty collected on alcohol and cigarettes. Last night, backbench Tory MPs said the situation was a ‘mistake’ which would ‘have a dampening impact on aspiration’ - and called on the Government to make reforms, particularly to inheritance tax. Jacob Rees-Mogg, Conservative MP for North East Somerset, told The Daily Telegraph: ‘We promised at the last election to increase the inheritance tax threshold. 'That was an extremely popular promise. I hope when we can afford it we will come back to that, and we should certainly be looking at whether you raise more revenue with lower rates. 'You should look at the dampening effect it has on aspiration. It hits people who do all the right things: who work hard, who save, who build up a nest egg for their families. They get penalised. That is a mistake.’ Before the last election, the Tories promised to increase the inheritance tax threshold from £325,000 to £1million but the plans were abandoned due to Liberal Democrat opposition. Inheritance tax is levied at a rate of 40 per cent on the value of an estate above the threshold - and rising property prices are putting even more people in the firing line. Prediction: Figures from the Treasury (pictured) say that by the end of the next financial year, the amount raised from inheritance tax, stamp duty land tax and stamp duty on shares is forecast to reach £21.9billion . Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs, told the newspaper: ‘The continuing increase in the amount of inheritance tax collected raises the importance of tackling this tax burden for many middle-income families. ‘Inheritance tax was designed as a tax for the rich, and is now paid by many middle-income families who have accumulated assets – usually their homes – paid for out of income that has already been taxed. I hope the next Conservative government will be a position to change this.' 'It hits people who do all the right things: who work hard, who save, who build up a nest egg for their families. They get penalised. That is a mistake' Jacob Rees-Mogg, Conservative MP . By the end of the decade, the gap between the two types of taxes will have increased further still, the Treasury predicts. Some £27.2billion will be raised from inheritance tax and stamp duties on land and shares, compared with £23.7billion from alcohol and tobacco duties, the Treasury predicts. Last night, a Treasury aide said: ‘These figures were published in March at the Budget and while we are having to pay off Labour’s deficit, couples can still leave £650,000 tax free. ‘Importantly, freezing the inheritance tax threshold means we can pay to end the scandal of people having to sell their homes to pay for social care – meaning they often had no home to leave to their children and grandchildren in the first place.’","Inheritance tax and stamp duty payments to hit £21.9bn by end of 2015/16 .

"White lines could be scrubbed out from the centre of urban roads after research showed the move dramatically cut the number of speeding cars. Transport for London, which controls major roads in the capital, conducted a study on three routes which showed vehicle speeds fell by up to 13 per cent. The report concluded: ‘Centre lines and hatching can provide a psychological sense of confidence to drivers that no vehicles will encroach on ‘their’ side of the road. White lines could be scrubbed out from the centre of urban roads after research showed the move dramatically cut the number of speeding cars (stock picture) ‘Centre line removal introduces an element of uncertainty which is reflected in lower speeds.’ TfL says the practice could be expanded to more routes - subject to ‘careful analysis of the site to determine if it is appropriate’. Roads where markings are used to highlight particular hazards, such as approaches to complex junctions, would not be considered. Removal of white lines has been backed by road safety campaigners. Amy Aeron-Thomas, executive director of crash reduction charity RoadPeace, said: ‘RoadPeace welcomes the news that white line removal has led to significant speed decreases on 30 mph roads. ‘At a time when government is promoting cycling and walking but cutting enforcement budgets, self enforcing measures are key. ‘TfL is to be credited with trialling this measure. We look forward to its wider use, including with 20mph roads.’ Removal of white lines has been backed by road safety campaigners, who argue it slows drivers down . Transport for London studied roads which had just been resurfaced. The most dramatic results were recorded on Seven Sisters Road, in north London, which has a 30mph limit. The speed of southbound traffic fell by 4.1mph from an average of 32.4mph to 28.3mph - almost 13 per cent - while northbound traffic speeds fell from 31.4mph to 29mph. The London study follows previous research from the Government’s Transport Research Laboratory which concluded there are ‘safety benefits’ to be gained from removing white lines in 30mph zones. Earlier trials by Wiltshire and Norfolk County Councils found that not reinstating white lines after resurfacing led to reductions in collisions causing injury, and in overall vehicle speeds. A Department for Transport spokesman said: ‘Decisions on what type of traffic calming to provide are for local authorities, taking into account local circumstances and road layout. It is for them to decide if removing centre lines is appropriate.’ He added that researchers from the Transport Research Laboratory had concluded that removing white lines ‘did help slow traffic but worked best when combined with other measures’.","Transport .

"The supermarket price war is set to intensify after a study found discount store Lidl was almost a third cheaper than the major chains. The retailer was included in The Grocer magazine’s weekly price survey for the first time – and scored highly on both price and customer service. It also emerged that Lidl and fellow budget chain Aldi have made dramatic gains in market share. In the 12 months to July 2014, Aldi’s market share rose 32.2 per cent, while Lidl’s grew 19.5 per cent. Retail experts said their success will intensify the competition, forcing bigger chains to ‘up their game’ and slash prices. This week, Waitrose became the latest store to offer four pints of milk for £1, the same as Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Asda. That is only slightly more than Lidl and Aldi, which both charge 95p. The Grocer’s latest ‘shopping basket survey’ found Lidl charged 29.5 per cent less than Tesco for 33 popular lines. A weekly shop at Lidl cost £49.23, compared with £57.83 at Morrisons, £59.95 at Asda, £63.73 at Tesco, £64.50 at Sainsbury’s and £71.84 at Waitrose. Only three Lidl products could be found for less elsewhere – Chicago Town pizza and Laughing Cow cheese at Morrisons, and cauliflower at Asda. Lidl charged 89p for six free-range eggs, compared with £1 at the second cheapest store. A 1kg bag of Lidl garden peas cost 99p, while the closest rival store, Asda, charged £1.38. A shopping basket comparison survey has found that Lidl  is the cheapest supermarket, beating five rivals including Morrisons, Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury's and Waitrose (file picture) Crucially, Lidl also scored 78 out of 100 for customer service at its High Wycombe store in Buckinghamshire, just one point behind the week’s winner, the Tesco Extra in Streatham, South London. Lidl came level with Waitrose and beat Asda, Morrisons and Sainsbury’s. Ronan Hegarty, of The Grocer, said: ‘It’s not a huge surprise Lidl is cheaper but the interesting thing is they are ranking highly for customer service. ‘The big chains now have to up their game.’ Mr Hegarty said Lidl and Aldi keep prices low by using simple supply chains and doing without expensive store fittings. He added: ‘The days of Tesco having 30 per cent plus of market share are long gone. There is too much competition.’ Lidl had 27 exclusively cheapest items out of the 33 included in the  comparison, including bread and grapes . Waitrose has announced that it will be cutting the price of milk to £1 for four pints of its own-label brand . John Coll, of analysts Kantar Worldpanel, said: ‘I don’t think the price war has ever gone away but I’d expect it to become more pointed in the coming months. 'It’s a very difficult environment for the big supermarkets at present, with very little inflation in groceries.’ Lidl said: ‘We are proud to be able to offer an enjoyable experience to our customers.’ Waitrose and Tesco have both cut the price of four pints of milk to £1. Farmers’ representatives warned the move has hit sales at independent stores. They urged chains not to cut the amount paid to farmers, up to 20p a pint. Waitrose said: ‘We work closely with our farmers, who help determine and are paid a leading price which takes into account cost of production.’","Study finds that Lidl is almost a third cheaper than major UK supermarkets .

"The children of a wealthy widow are in a legal battle with her former physiotherapist over the woman’s £30 million fortune. The two adult children told a court how the female physiotherapist has possession of their frail mother’s jewellery including a ‘very valuable’ diamond ring and £5 million of her money. They also feared she was planning to take their 81-year-old mother, who suffers from Parkinson’s disease and dementia, to Florida without their consent. The children told the Court of Protection hearing that the physiotherapist helped herself to money and valuables . At a preliminary Court of Protection hearing, the children argued that the physiotherapist had helped herself to money and valuables from their mother and late father, who died in June this year, and ‘emotionally and physically abused’ the elderly couple. District Judge Denzil Lush - who ruled no parties in the case could be identified - heard the physiotherapist was employed by the couple in 2000, and grew personally close to the husband, which led to a serious deterioration in his relationship with his children. The children claimed that between 2009 and 2011, their father and the physiotherapist restricted contact with their mother. When their father died in June 2014, they feared that the physiotherapist had ‘unfettered control of the household and could physically abuse their mother’. The children’s barrister, Philip Jenkins, said: ‘There is a strong case of physical, emotional and financial abuse against their elderly and vulnerable parents.’ They also expressed concerns she was planning to take their mother to Florida (pictured), without their consent . At an earlier hearing in July, the children were granted a court injunction, forcing the physiotherapist to hand over their mother’s passport and not take her out of England. The physiotherapist was also required to leave the widow’s home, and she later gave her up appointment as executor of the widow’s will, and flew to Florida. At the second hearing, held to consider costs in the case, Mr Jenkins argued ‘it is not without significance that a substantial proportion’ of her 60th wedding anniversary jewellery purchased by her late husband in February 2014 was in the physiotherapist’s possession... plus a very valuable diamond ring’ belonging to their mother. And they claimed she had received about £5 million of the family’s money since 2008. Jordan Holland, representing the physiotherapist, said his client ‘does not accept’ the truth of the evidence against her, but if she gave detailed replies it would drive up the legal costs. Mr Holland called for her £11,000 costs should be paid from the widow’s estate, which was worth £30 million. She had complied with a wide ranging injunction backed by the threat of prison, he added, but that there was no real need for the order, as she had simply suggested to the children that their mother might like to go to Florida. District Judge Lush ruled that the allegations against the physiotherapist were a matter for another court ‘in the context of any claim brought against her for the recovery for funds.’ He also lifted the earlier injunction. Her conduct in the case, he said, had been satisfactory and he ordered all costs to be paid from the widow’s estate. The judge also declaration that the widow’s decisions in her ‘living will’ were valid and applied to her treatment.","Wealthy widow's children in legal battle over their mother's £30m fortune .

And he drove a widow on a 260-mile round trip to see a football match to cheer her up. Last night, his efforts above and beyond the call of duty were recognised when he was declared overall winner at the Daily Mail’s Health Hero Awards, in association with Boots and ITV’s This Morning. Dr John Cormack's (right) efforts above and beyond the call of duty were recognised when he was declared overall winner at the Daily Mail's Health Hero Awards tonight. He and four other winners were earlier invited to a reception at No 10 where Prime Minister David Cameron hailed their 'incredible dedication and compassion' Dr Cormack and four other winners were earlier invited to a reception at No 10 where Prime Minister David Cameron hailed their ‘incredible dedication and compassion’. The awards celebrate the unsung heroes of the Health Service. Dr Cormack, 67, who runs Greenwood Surgery in South Woodham Ferrers, Essex, was presented with his award at a gala dinner at the Marriott Hotel, Grosvenor Square, hosted by This Morning presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford. Personalities attending included Esther Rantzen, Jeff Brazier and Barry Cryer. He received his award and prize of a £5,000 holiday from public health minister Jane Ellison. Ian Gillard, who nominated him, said: ‘He can’t do enough for others. He’s the sort of GP who opens the surgery on Saturdays to give an urgent blood test, and works Bank Holidays so his patients don’t have to queue in A&E. Fellow winners: Trisha Milbanke, a cleaner on a geriatric ward at Newcastle's Freeman Hospital, stays on after her eight-hour shifts to do unofficial 'overtime', helping frail and vulnerable patients. Right, Dr Richard Appleton, a paediatric neurologist at Alder Hey Hospital, Liverpool, was nominated by Coleen Rooney's parents, Tony and Colette McLoughlin, after his devotion to their daughter Rosie, who died last year from a brain disorder aged 14 . ‘He pops in to make cups of tea for the elderly and infirm, and on weekends he’ll visit patients in hospital. He gives terminally ill patients his mobile number, insisting he’s on duty 24 hours a day.’ But his care goes far beyond the medical. When he heard a 75-year-old widow and lifelong West Ham fan had never been to a match, he spent a Saturday driving her on a 260-mile round trip to see them play at Southampton. Another patient recovering from surgery was going to miss his 50th wedding anniversary party. So Dr Cormack sprang him from hospital, drove him to the party and later returned him. ‘Dr Cormack is one in a million,’ said Mr Gillard. ‘All his patients love him to bits.’ Awards: Tireless work to improve the lives of patients with eating disorders led to an award for Carol Bennett, a nurse at Savernake Hospital, Marlborough. Right, volunteer Ian Fraser, from Dawlish, Devon, gives up 30 hours a week for a befriending charity set up by a GP practice . Last night Dr Cormack said: ‘It’s the most fulfilling job.

"All action: Met Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe broke off an interview when he saw a taxi driver allegedly being robbed, jumped into the cab and soon afterwards arrested a suspect . It is never a bright idea to commit a crime in front of a policeman, let alone Britain’s most senior officer. Perhaps the brazen yobs who robbed a taxi driver in broad daylight on a busy London street presumed that Scotland Yard boss Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe was too busy giving a radio interview to do anything about it. But they hadn’t reckoned on the steely determination of the Commissioner who broke off mid-sentence to give chase to the gang, leaping in the victim’s minicab to pursue them yesterday. In a scene described by stunned locals as like something out of a film, the 56-year-old Commissioner once dubbed a ‘crime-busting machine’, sprang into action arresting a 19-year-old suspect within minutes, while his bodyguard collared a 17-year-old accomplice. The incident in Tottenham, North London was captured on tape at 11.20am yesterday as the Metropolitan Police boss was taking part in a pre-recorded interview with BBC London 94.9 Drivetime presenter Eddie Nestor. As Sir Bernard was talking about police cuts, a taxi slowed to a halt beside him and four thugs leapt out and ran off to the fury of the driver who called out for help, saying in broken English: ‘I’m a cab driver. ‘I put £20 here (gesturing to the dashboard). Is no pay me and the money is gone.’ Sir Bernard responded: ‘Do you know where they’ve gone?’ adding: ‘I’m going to go with you.’ The Commissioner then leapt into the victim’s minicab to look for the suspects before continuing the pursuit in a squad car, arresting a 19-year-old suspect on suspicion of theft minutes later. A 17-year-old man was also apprehended at nearby Bruce Grove train station on suspicion of theft, handling stolen goods and making off without payment by an accompanying officer who followed him on foot. Afterwards the driver, who gave his name as Mohammed, told the BBC he didn’t know who the Commissioner was, but described him as a ‘very good, very kind’ man who came to his aid after passengers stole £20 from his dashboard before running away without paying the fare. He said: ‘When I see the police, I ask the police ‘please can you stop the guys?’ One local shop worker who witnessed the chase said: ‘I thought they were filming for some sort of TV programme - it looked like it could’ve been staged. ‘There was a cab that had pulled up across the road and I could also see the guys who were filming. ‘I went outside and saw two police men. Another policeman, who was in plain clothes, had grabbed a young guy outside the station and had him pinned up against the wall.’ Another witness, who asked not to be named, recalled: ‘We saw people running and guys with camera - I thought they were making a movie.’ Quick decision: Sir Bernard leaps into the taxi in Tottenham, north London, to help look for the suspects . Yesterday the top policeman whose motto is ‘total policing’ told of his pride at making an arrest in every rank he has held since becoming an officer in 1979, joking that it was a ‘disgrace’ he hadn’t felt a collar in almost three years as the Met boss. He told the BBC: ‘The important thing for today, at least for me, is that I have made an arrest at every rank as a police officer, so as chief constable at Merseyside, but never as commissioner, and I have been here three years - that’s very slack, it’s a disgrace, but today we have put it right.’ Sir Bernard, who has been nicknamed Eliot Ness- the legendary lawman in prohibition America whose team of Untouchables brought down Al Capone- is known as an all action Commissioner who is equally at home patrolling on horseback as behind a desk. In 2006 when he was chief constable of Merseyside Police, he sprinted after a suspected drink-driver in Liverpool after spotting him from his chauffeur-driven car. A Met Police spokesman said: ‘Sir Bernard was in Tottenham High Road at the junction of Bruce Grove recording an interview with BBC London Radio, when a mini cab stopped and the driver called for police help. ‘Four males were seen to jump out of the vehicle and run off, closely followed by an officer who was with the Commissioner. ‘A 17-year old youth was arrested inside Bruce Grove Rail Station on suspicion of theft, handling and making off without payment. ‘Descriptions were circulated and the Commissioner got into a police car which arrived at the scene and went to look for the outstanding suspects. ‘In nearby Napier Road, one of the suspects, a 19-year old man, was seen and arrested on suspicion of theft and making off without payment.’ Last night the two suspects were currently being held in police stations in north London.","Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, 56, taking part in pre-recorded interview .

"Schools across the country reported problems as Nick Clegg’s flagship policy of giving free meals to all young children was introduced yesterday. The initiative was hailed a ‘massive success’ by the Liberal Democrats, but even schools in Mr Clegg’s Sheffield backyard admitted they couldn’t cook their own hot meals. Nine primaries in the city are bussing in meals cooked at neighbouring schools amid claims of a £400,000 shortfall in funds to upgrade kitchens. Food for thought: Nick Clegg marking yesterday's launch of his flagship meals policy at a school in London . Reports also emerged of canteen renovations over-running and deliveries of vital equipment such as tables and chairs failing to turn up. One school is offering hot meals on a ‘first come, first served’ basis while another even considered serving airline food supplied by local airports before opting for cold sandwiches. As they battle to implement the controversial £1billion policy, some schools are seating children for lunch in classrooms, music rooms or Portakabins because they lack dining space. Others are running three lunch sittings, restricting pupils’ choice of food and asking seven-year-olds to serve drinks to younger pupils to take pressure off staff. Lib Dem Schools Minister David Laws declared the scheme, which involves offering free lunches to all four to seven-year-olds, a ‘massive success’, while Mr Clegg insisted that giving children hot lunches can be better for their learning than extra English and maths lessons. The Deputy Prime Minister said that ‘giving a healthy hot meal at lunchtime is as, if not more, effective than many of the, say, literacy and numeracy initiatives which have been undertaken in the past in the classroom’. Teething problems? Schools in his own constituency could not cook hot food for pupils on the first day . But critics claim the educational and health benefits touted by Mr Clegg have yet to be rigorously proven. They also claim councils and schools have been forced to raid other budgets to push the initiative through because the Government failed to properly fund it. Oliver Coppard, Labour’s candidate against Mr Clegg in next year’s national polls, said: ‘In trying to get this policy in place before the General Election, Nick Clegg has – as usual – over-promised and under-delivered.’ At Dudley Infant Academy in Hastings, East Sussex, hot meals are on a ‘first come, first served basis’, with a cold packed lunch available as an alternative. In Portsmouth, Solent Infant School will use its music room as a lunch area and a Portakabin has been installed at Devonshire Infant School to provide additional dining space. Bournemouth Council said 12 primary schools – half of the town’s total – will start the year by offering free cold packed lunches to some or all of its key stage one pupils rather than hot meals. Nick Clegg yesterday made a string of assertions about why his policy was destined to be an overwhelming success. Here, Home Affairs Editor JAMES SLACK sorts the claims from the reality. CLAIM: All the evidence, and this has been stress-tested and analysed, shows it has a dramatic effect on educational performance. REALITY: The Department for Education’s own evaluation of pilots in London and Durham found a 1.9 percentage point increase in the proportion of pupils reaching the expected level in reading at Key Stage 1 and a 2.2 percentage point increase for maths. Critics says that, overall, this is barely statistically significant. For the highest performing children, there was no positive impact. Crucially, the authors of the study admit the reasons for the improvement in overall performance were not clear. The pilots included a wider programme to promote healthy eating, such as providing advice to parents, which may also be responsible. CLAIM: It is good for children’s health. REALITY: The evaluation stated there was no evidence the two-year pilot led to significant health benefits. For instance, it found ‘there was no evidence of any change in children’s Body Mass Index’. Researchers also found the pilot did not appear to significantly improve children’s behaviour or absence rates from school. CLAIM: The policy is about having children share a healthy meal together at lunchtime rather than having children parcelled off, one group at one end of the room on free school meals and the other not. REALITY: Russell Hobby, of the National Association of Head Teachers, said he could think of no examples in ‘living memory’ of schools segregating pupils who receive free school meals. CLAIM: I strongly dispute this idea that as we balance the books we don’t do more to invest in a future in which every boy and girl irrespective of their birth gets the best possible chances in life. REALITY: The key point. Firstly, with the deficit still running at more than £100billion, the Government is not ‘balancing the books’. The money to pay for school meals amounts to £1billion of extra borrowing. Many head teachers argue it could be spent far better elsewhere. Coincidentally, councils warned last month of a £1bn shortfall in the funding they need to provide the school places needed to cope with Britain’s rapidly growing population. The number of children in classes of more than 30 has increased by 200 per cent since 2010 – breaking the Prime Minister’s promise to create ‘small schools with smaller class sizes’. Julian Rutherford, of Principals Catering, which supplies schools in the South East, said: ‘We are ready to launch the expanded free meals policy but it is likely there will be teething problems. ‘We are having to transport food into 16 schools which do not have kitchens, mostly in Faversham and Sittingbourne.’ In Somerset, the BBC reported that 46 schools out of 201 are unable to provide hot meals. In Buckinghamshire, the figure was 45 out of 159. Lynda Mitchell, contracts manager for North Somerset Council, said she had been ‘almost reduced to tears… by builders not meeting agreed deadlines and not apparently caring’. Jo Wotton, a catering manager for five schools in Cornwall, tweeted that one school was refusing to offer free meals at all ‘until they get their kitchen in October’. Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ‘There will be some schools that will be providing a cold meal this term while they wait for the building work to finish off. ‘The logistics of getting large numbers of children through, how you schedule the timings of lunch and whether you’ve got kids eating in their classrooms or not – all that will be quite difficult for schools. They’ll manage it but it’ll put a huge burden on them.’ Some £1billion has been earmarked over two years to cover the cost of meals, while £150million has been spent upgrading kitchens, with an additional £22.5million going to smaller schools. The Department for Education said only 239 out of 16,500 schools would be providing a cold meal instead of a hot one this week. Mr Laws said: ‘I am absolutely delighted that our statistics, which come from local authorities and schools, show that 98.5 per cent of schools across the country – 16,500 schools – are delivering a hot meal option from the start of term.’ It was a ‘massive success’, he said.","Nick Clegg launched flagship policy of free means nationwide yesterday .

"His colourful past has included a spell behind bars and a stint on a reality TV show. But Lord Charles Brocket broke new ground last week when a convoy of removal vans packed with his family’s art and antique furniture was pursued by eight police cars up a busy motorway. Far from being the result of a daring heist, however, staff working for the peer were pulled over by officers as he attempted – he claims rightfully – to reclaim a number of valuable family heirlooms at the centre of a financial dispute. Scroll down to see video . Lord Brocket, who attempted - he claims rightfully - to reclaim a number of valuable family heirlooms . Lord . Brocket and a team of removal men with three vans had taken the items . from his family estate – Brocket Hall in Hertfordshire – early on . Thursday morning. He . had driven ahead but officers caught up with the vans nearby on the A1M . and forced their drivers to return the antiques to the stately home . pending a police investigation. Last night, Lord Brocket, 62, told the Daily Mail: ‘It is a total farce. ‘The contents are worth millions of pounds and include furniture plus art from Van Dyck – items which have been in our family for a long time. I’m gobsmacked that on the Queen’s highway somebody can be stopped by the police for transporting their own furniture.’ The row centres on the contents of Brocket Hall, which he was forced to lease when he was jailed for an insurance scam in the 1990s because he could not afford to maintain the £200million estate from prison. A second agreement was drawn up so that . the antique contents of the hall could also be rented, and it is an . alleged failure to keep up with payments on this contract that led to . Lord Brocket’s dawn raid on the 500-acre estate. Removal men carrying the valuable artwork from Brocket Hall in Hertfordshire but the antiques were eventually ordered to be returned to the stately home . The peer, his estate agent and 43 removal men apparently walked in to the hall through open doors and claimed almost all of the furniture and antiques inside – including works by Van Dyck, Daniel Mytens and Sir Edwin Landseer and a pair of George II walnut side tables. The items removed are thought to be worth more than £2million. Lord Brocket, who has appeared on TV reality show I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here!, added: ‘The police have hijacked a couple of million pounds worth of stuff but haven’t asked any questions about who owns it. What is going on? Why was that?’ Brocket Hall was built in 1760 and has housed royalty, prime ministers and one of Lord  Byron’s lovers. Brocket Hall in Hatfield in Hertfordshire, which Lord Brocket was forced to lease when he was jailed and couldn't afford to maintain the estate from prison . Lord Brocket’s family bought the estate about a century ago and he inherited it from his grandfather in 1971. But in 1996 the Old Etonian and former Army officer was jailed for five years for a fraudulent £4.3million insurance claim on four of his vintage sports cars. He decided to lease the property for £9million for 60 years. The property has been rented since then by Brocket Hall International, part of Hong Kong-based CCA International, which is run by German hotelier Dieter Klostermann. The estate has been run as a historic house and golf club, used for corporate entertainment, conferences, exhibitions and weddings. Mr Klostermann and BHI did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Hertfordshire Constabulary said: ‘Detectives from Hatfield’s Local Crime Unit are currently investigating an incident that occurred at Brocket Hall on Thursday morning. ‘Officers attended the estate following a report of property being taken. Following officers’ attendance, the property was returned. ‘Currently, officers are attempting to establish the exact circumstances of what has happened and whether any criminal offences have been committed.’ Fladgate solicitors, for the trustees of the First Lord Brocket Will Trust which owns and leases the property, said in a statement: 'Much of the contents of Brocket Hall in terms of the pictures, Brocket family portraits and family heirlooms have been licenced to a tenant, a company called Brocket Hall (Jersey) Ltd which currently operates Brocket Hall as a golf course and conference centre. 'The trustees of Brocket Hall ended the licences with the tenant in November 2013 and requested the return of the items to the trust. 'The tenant is legally obliged to return these items to the Trustees. Despite written requests to the tenant’s solicitors, the tenant has failed to return the items. 'Yesterday morning (19th June), a removal company, at the request of the trustees went into the Hall, as they had the right to do, without the use of any force, and removed many of the contents that belonged to them.  The contents were removed in three separate vans. 'We believe that the incident may have been mistakenly reported as a theft. It was not a theft. 'The Trustees are entitled to possession of those goods. The tenant (Brocket Hall (Jersey) Ltd) is well aware that the licences allowing it to use the goods ended last November and no argument has ever been received from the tenant to the contrary.  The tenant knows that it is not entitled to the goods and has no right to be using them.'","Lord Brocket attempted to reclaim valuable family heirlooms .

"David Blunkett is to quit Parliament after 28 years, he announced today . David Blunkett last night announced he is quitting  Parliament at the next election after 28 years as an MP. The former Labour cabinet minister, 67, revealed he is stepping down at a meeting with party members in his constituency. Describing it as ‘by far the most difficult political decision I have ever made’, he said: ‘I owe so much to so many people who have made it possible for me to play a significant part in public life.’ The married father of four said it was a privilege to spend ‘eight years in the Cabinet of a Labour Government’. But in what may be seen as a swipe at Ed Miliband, he said the party leadership ‘wish to see new faces in ministerial office’. The MP for Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough added: ‘I would rather leave while I am still giving 100 per cent.’ Last night, Mr Miliband paid tribute to Mr Blunkett, saying he was ‘a man whose commitment and determination have carried him to the highest positions in politics with one purpose: to serve the people of our country’. Mr Blunkett, who entered politics aged 22, was Britain’s first blind Cabinet minister, serving  in roles including Education Secretary under Tony Blair. His achievements included tough policies to ensure  basic standards of literacy  and numeracy. He had been tipped as a future prime minister but was forced to resign in 2004 over allegations he helped fast-track a tourist visa for his ex-lover Kimberly Quinn’s nanny – which he denied. Mr Blunkett was brought back to the Cabinet after the 2005 general election. But he was forced to resign a second time in November that year after claims of a ‘conflict of interest’ created by his being a director in a firm proposing to bid for government contracts. He was later found not to have broken the ministerial code. Announcing his departure in front of constituency members, Mr Blunkett said: ¿I owe so much to so many people who have made it possible for me to play a significant part in public life¿ .","Politician announced he is to quit Parliament after 28 years as an MP .

"A British father-of-two stabbed to death in Barbados was a former Iraqi war veteran forced to quit the Army after a grenade blast damaged his hearing. Brian Mulligan, 28, was on a six month contract to the Caribbean island working as a telecoms engineer when he became involved in an early morning dispute with a suspected drug dealer. The former machine gunner was rushed to hospital at 5.30am on Sunday morning after being stabbed in the chest in the popular tourist area of St Lawrence Gap but he died from his injuries. Army veteran and telecoms engineer Brian Mulligan had been in Barbados for eight weeks . Mulligan, originally from Forest Hill in South-East London, had served as a soldier for eight years and completed tours of Iraq, Afghanistan and Northern Ireland before being medically discharged two years ago. Colleagues revealed that he had 'served with distinction' and had been ranked tenth out of 360 men in a contest that involved an endurance march and shooting. Mulligan's army career ended prematurely when he led a charge into an Iraqi house. An enemy grenade exploded close to him and permanently damaged his hearing. After his discharge, he became a telecoms engineer, installing cables at Heathrow Airport's new Terminal 2. Mr Mulligan flew to Barbados with other British engineers eight weeks ago to begin a project on the paradise isle, leaving his wife Jenna, 28, and children aged seven and four, behind in Ashtead, Surrey. Barbados police said he was working with the Caribbean's leading telecommunications company LIME, which is owned by UK-based Cable & Wireless Communications. The company's offices are in capital Bridgetown, which is about three miles from 'The Gap' where Mulligan was stabbed. Mulligan was stabbed following an altercation with a local man in tourist hotspot, St Lawrence Gap. The neighbourhood is less than three miles from the capital, Bridgetown . Stabbed: Brian Mulligan was taken to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital but died from his stab wounds . Mr Mulligan flew to Barbados with other British engineers eight weeks ago, leaving his wife Jenna, 28, and children aged seven and four, behind in Ashtead, Surrey. A former Heathrow workmate, Andy Miles, said Mr Mulligan was a cheerful colleague who had adored his children. A former Heathrow workmate, Andy Miles, said Mulligan was a cheerful colleague who adored his children. Brian Mulligan had been working with the Caribbean's leading telecoms company LIME . He said: 'He always was a happy go lucky guy. Even when work was hard, he would always be up for a laugh and would be smiling. 'He told me all about his time in the army and how he lost a large percentage of his hearing. It happened from an explosion in a house in Iraq. 'Insurgents released a grenade into building they stormed and he was first in. 'The explosion was in a side room and the walls were so thick it kept the explosion and noise inside, rupturing his eardrums.' He added: 'He loved serving his country and was gutted to have to be medically discharged.' In 2005, Mulligan spent six months dealing with riots and public disorder on one of the last British tours of Northern Ireland. A friend who worked with him at Heathrow said: 'He was a loyal colleague who had served the Army heroically in challenging situations abroad. 'You always felt more confident when he was around because of his cheerful nature.' Devastated friend and former Army colleague Anthony Sissons, 29, who was working with Mr Mulligan, wrote on his Facebook page: ‘Good night mate!! Keep a seat free for me in about 50 years time when I’ll see you again, sleep well, miss you, x’. Mr Sissons’ mother Lesley said: ‘My son is distraught. They had gone out to watch the England - Italy football match. Anthony went back to where they were staying but Mr Mulligan and a few others went on to a nightclub when all this happened.’ Mr Mulligan’s wife Jemma, 28, who lives in Ashtead, Surrey, was too upset to comment. One friend said: ‘Brian has served his country in numerous trouble spots and is a good family man. For this to happen when he is on a supposedly safe island is tragic news.’ A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: 'We are aware of the death of a British National in Barbados on 15 June.

"A spokesman for Chanel, whose No 5 has been on sale for 93 years, said adapting would be a 'challenge' Some of the world’s most popular perfumes - including Chanel No 5 - are under threat from EU regulations branded ‘absurd’ by manufacturers. Brussels is planning to target perfumiers with ingredient bans and labelling requirements aimed at protecting a tiny fraction of consumers who suffer from allergies. The rules will force perfume makers to reformulate many of their scents and change the packaging of their products, leading to extra costs. Leading brands admit coping with the changes - which the EU accepts will benefit just one to three per cent of users - will be a ‘challenge’. Some of the 12 ingredients regarded as the pillars of the luxury perfume industry - including coumarin, found in tropical tonka beans; and eugenol, from rose oil - could be restricted. Citra, found in lemon and tangerine oils, plus atranol and chloroatranol, are likely to be banned. A spokesman for Chanel, whose No 5 has been on sale for 93 years and is the world’s best-selling perfume, said: ‘Adapting is a challenge but it is precisely the talent of our ‘nose’ to be able to preserve the qualities and olfactive (scent) identity of our perfumes while also taking into account new regulatory constraints.’ Hermes as well as Dior and Guerlain - both owned by LVMH - are preparing themselves for the new rules by progressively changing their formulas. The changes have angered Frederic Malle, who founded the French luxury perfume company Editions de Parfums Frederic Malle. He said: ‘If we ban citra from perfumes, of which certain elements are allergens, we should ban orange juice. It is absurd. We should not ban nature, only learn how to live with it. ‘It can take more than six months to reformulate a perfume, and a minimum of some 30 tests ... and this is precious time that cannot be spent on creating new perfumes. So to protect a small portion of the population, we are making the rest suffer.’ The European Commission is planning to ban, in its original form, oak moss and tree moss, two of the most widely used base notes which give perfumes depth and help make the scents last. Such mosses can be found in Chanel’s No.5 and Dior’s Miss Dior but the brands have been working on using altered versions, stripped of the molecules atranol and chloroatranol, regarded as potential allergens by the EU. The EU is also planning on banning HICC, a popular synthetic molecule which replicates the ‘lily of the valley’ smell. In 2012, an advisory report had recommended severely limiting the use of natural ingredients, on the basis that one to three per cent of people could be allergic. ‘We understand that drastic reductions . in the authorised concentrations of these ingredients would have . created major disruptions to the industry,’ said David Hudson, spokesman . for consumer policy at the European Commission. Brussels is planning to target perfumiers with ingredient bans and labelling requirements aimed at protecting a tiny fraction of consumers who suffer from allergies . The new rules, which will effectively take the form of an amendment to the Cosmetics Regulation adopted in 2009, have undergone a 12-week public consultation that ended on May 14, the results of which are expected to be published by early July. The consultation triggered more than 200 responses from industry players, consumers’ associations and researchers, which the EU said was a relatively high number. A draft proposal could be given to EU member states by August and by the following month a final version sent for scrutiny by the European Council and Parliament, which have three months to oppose it. The regulations will also require perfume makers to inform consumers about potential allergens contained in their products but it has not yet decided how this will work in practice and how many of them should be labelled. It has raised the number of ingredients that must be labelled from 26 to more than 80 and is looking at ways to allow perfume makers to provide information about them on the Internet or through smartphone scans to avoid having to cram them on the package.","Brussels plans to issue new rules to perfumiers to protect allergy sufferers .

"The Fairtrade scheme is not helping the poorest workers it was set up to support, a damning investigation has found. Fairtrade goods, which include bananas, coffee and chocolate, generate . annual UK sales of £1.78billion. Farmers signing up to the scheme must . agree to meet social, labour and environmental standards set by . Fairtrade International. But research by the University of London’s School of Oriental and . African Studies has found that on Fairtrade farms in Uganda and . Ethiopia, profits failed to trickle down to much of the workforce. Damning: A report said the Fairtrade scheme was not always helping the workers that needed it most . The Government-sponsored report claimed the scheme, established more than 20 years ago, has not effectively improved the lives of the poorest people. It even concluded that wages on non-certified farms were actually higher than for those growing Fairtrade products. Researchers also found evidence of ‘widespread use’ of child labour – . with some workers as young as ten – when doing checks on 1,500 Fairtrade . workers. One of the report’s authors, University of London economics professor Christopher Cramer, said: ‘Wages in other comparable areas and among comparable employers producing the same crops but where there was no Fairtrade certification were usually higher and working conditions better. ‘In our research sites, Fairtrade has not been an effective mechanism for improving the lives of wage workers, the poorest rural people.’ The study found that some social projects funded through Fairtrade were found not to provide equal benefit to all. In one example, modern toilets funded through the scheme were reserved for managers, while poor workers did not have access to proper facilities. Child labour: The report examined farming under Fairtrade in Ethiopia (pictured) and Uganda . Meanwhile, when workers aged over 14 years were interviewed, ‘a very large proportion of them said they had been working since the age of 10, or even earlier’, the report said. ‘What is clear... is that very significant numbers of young, school-age children are having to work for wages in the production of agricultural export crops, including Fairtrade-certified commodities.’ The authors attacked a ‘combination of idealism and naivety’ to explain why Fairtrade did not reach the poorest people. ‘One possibility is that Fairtrade producer organisations are always established in significantly poorer, more marginalised areas where an accumulation of disadvantages means smallholder farmers are unable to pay even the paltry wages offered by smallholders in other areas without Fairtrade producer organisations,’ the report said. ‘Fairtrade attempts to support and subsidise co-operative groups of ‘smallholder’ producers on the remarkably naïve assumption that the benefits of this support are distributed evenly amongst the group. This assumption about egalitarian distribution is unwarranted.’ Fairtrade International said in a statement that the report was ‘unfair and generalised’. A spokesman said:  ‘In several places it compares wages and working conditions of workers in areas where small-scale Fairtrade-certified tea and coffee farmers were present with those on large-scale plantations in the same regions,” it said in a statement. Study: Farmers in Bako, central Ethiopia. Fairtrade International said the study was too generalised . ‘The report itself identifies farm size, scale and integration into global trade chains as major factors influencing conditions for wage workers, but then its conclusions appear to be based on unfair and distorted comparisons between farms and organisations of dramatically different size, nature and means. ‘When comparisons are based more on like-for-like situations, such as the study’s own analysis of Ugandan coffee in small scale coffee production set-ups, it finds key areas where workers in areas with Fairtrade-certified farmer organisations in fact had better conditions compared with those in non-certified, such as free meals, overtime payments and loans and wage advances for workers. ‘This is in sharp contrast to the more generalised conclusions being presented by the School of Oriental and African Studies team.’ Fairtrade was founded by overseas development and consumer groups including Oxfam and the Women’s Institute - and has grown into one of the world’s most trusted ethical schemes. It is involved with 1.24 million farmers and workers around the world, and the Fairtrade Foundation contributes to the funding of schools, health clinics and sanitation projects. Farmers joining the scheme must agree to meet social, labour and environmental standards. Fairtrade products are not only popular with individual consumers but also served by Starbucks, the House of Commons and airline Virgin Atlantic.","Scheme began 20 years ago and generates £1.78bn a year in UK sales .

"'I face massive physical challenges every day which can knock your confidence very quickly,' lastminute.com co-founder said . Accident: Martha Lane Fox has described how she has struggled to cope following a car crash in Morocco in 2004 . Ten years after the car crash that almost killed her, internet  entrepreneur Martha Lane Fox has told how simply going for a walk remains a struggle. The 41-year-old, who co-founded online booking agency lastminute.com, broke more than 25 bones in the crash in Morocco in 2004. The impact smashed her pelvis in six places, shattered her right arm and leg, and caused severe internal bleeding which led to a stroke. ‘It’s not easy being inside me any more,’ she said. ‘I have to think to move.

I can’t feel my feet or legs. ‘I face massive physical challenges every day which can knock your confidence very quickly.’ Baroness Lane Fox told The Daily Telegraph  she can’t work full-time ‘because of my weird body – that can take (your confidence) away’. After the crash, the British entrepreneur was flown to England for treatment and spent six months in hospital, undergoing a gruelling 28 operations. Describing her physical state, she said: ‘I don’t find walking difficult but I find it exhausting, because you have to think, “lift your foot, lift your foot”. ‘I’m actually quite physically strong, it’s just that I’m a bit dangerous because I can’t balance very well and I have to think about it all the time and that’s incredibly hard. ‘I have to think about the movement and make the movement happen in a much more conscious way. ‘It’s quite a challenge – I fall over a lot on to my knees, I walk with a stick outside. ‘I face massive physical challenges every day, something that’s a constant and ever-present factor of my life that I have to manage.’ Lady Lane Fox was injured after she stepped down as managing director of lastminute.com in 2003, and before the venture was sold for £577million to Sabre Holdings.

"A bride stunned shoppers by visiting a supermarket in her wedding dress to stock up on booze. Anna Savery had no time to dress down when she called in at Asda after tying the knot with husband James - because there wasn’t long before the store was due to close. She said she felt no inhibitions because she had previously visited the store in her pyjamas. Scroll down for video . Walking down the aisles: Bride Anna Savery stunned shoppers in Cwmbran, south Wales, when she went on a last-minute dash for alcohol in Asda. She had no time to change - because the shop was about to shut . Mrs Savery, 39, and her 26-year-old husband had tied the knot at Pontypool Register Office, South Wales, and had their ‘wedding breakfast’ at a carvery restaurant. To keep the cost down, the couple decided to have the evening party at Mrs Savery’s mother’s house. The new bride, who dashed around the supermarket in Cwmbran, Torfaen, to buy alcohol with her new mother-in-law and sister-in-law, was overwhelmed by the reactions of staff and customers. ‘People were smiling and asking for photos. It was surreal,’ said Mrs Savery, a mother of three. ‘I felt like a celebrity. I had people saying I looked beautiful and one man said his daughter said I looked like a princess.’ The visit to Asda was a ‘very impromptu idea’, she admitted. Something cold, something brewed: Mrs Savery needed the alcohol for a reception that night at her mother's house, and said she was unruffled at her surprise appearance because she once visited the store in pyjamas . ‘I decided to go to Asda, but it was shutting in 45 minutes so I didn’t have time to go and change. ‘But I have been in my pyjamas before, why not in my wedding dress?’ Mrs Savery was congratulated by Cwmbran blogger Ben Black who filmed her out shopping and put the video online. Alongside the video, he wrote: ‘I’m smiling and have goose bumps as I type this blog. ‘To Anna and James - have a fantastic night and wonderful future together. You put a grin on a lot of people’s faces tonight.’ Mrs Savery’s choice of shopping attire may have raised no eyebrows at Asda but a nearby Tesco store has previously banned customers from shopping in their pyjamas. Dash: The new bride went for her lightning-quick trip into this branch of Asda in Cwmbran, South Wales . Low-cost: Mrs Savery had tied the knot with her husband James at Pontypool Register Office (pictured) and had her wedding day breakfast at a carvery restaurant before a party at her mother's house . Notices were put up in Tesco’s St Mellons branch in Cardiff in 2010 saying: ‘Footwear must be worn at all times and no nightwear is permitted.’ One customer, Elaine Carmody, a full-time mother of two, was refused service for wearing pyjamas. She described the ban as ‘ridiculous and pathetic’. She said she had been ‘popping in for a pack of fags’ but ‘would have gone in clothed’ for a full shop. ‘If you’re allowed to wear jogging bottoms, why aren’t you allowed to wear pyjamas in there? That’s what I don’t understand,’ she said. A Tesco spokesman said the company did not have a strict dress code but it did not want people shopping in their nightwear in case it offended other customers.","Anna Savery was tying the knot in bargain ceremony in Pontypool, Torfaen .

"Millions of workers are being hit with extra tax demands as officials attempt to claw back under-payments - despite £300 million of reforms which were supposed to reduce errors. HM Revenue and Customs last night revealed 5.3 million people paid the wrong amount in 2013-14, including 3.5 million who paid too little and will have to make extra contributions in future years. Two million people who paid too much tax will be able to claim refunds. Refund errors: HM Revenue and Customs revealed 3.5million people paid too little, and will have to now pay more this year, while 5.3million have paid the wrong amount in the last 12 months . HMRC has now started writing to those affected by the errors, which average £300 per person and have occurred despite reforms costing £270 million - supposed to improve the accuracy of the pay-as-you-earn system. The number of people affected by errors has increased in 2013/14 from 5.2 million in 2012/13. Changes to the tax system are supposed to use ‘real time information’ under which employers report details of what tax payments they have made to HMRC on a weekly or monthly basis, to ensure they are correct. Response: HMRC has said that 2million people who paid too much tax will be able to claim refunds . The number of errors under the new system has disappointed businesses. Kate Upton, a payroll consultant, told the Daily Telegraph last night: ‘Taxpayers have spent hundreds of millions on RTI and employers have had to spend hundreds of millions to use the new system, so we are entitled to expect significantly fewer errors in the process.’ An HMRC spokesman said: ‘There will always be end-of-year reconciliation due to the way PAYE works. Most people pay the right tax throughout the year, but there will always be a small percentage of the 41 million people in PAYE who have underpayments or overpayments at year end. ‘This could be because they have moved jobs, received a number of different sources of income or received benefits-in-kind that were only reported at the end of the year.’ He added: ‘The effect of Real Time Information is not reflected yet as it has not bedded in but, over time, RTI will help to reduce the number of cases that have to be reconciled. The estimates quoted for reconciliations in 2013-14 are based upon actual numbers in 2012-13.’","It has been revealed that 5.3million paid wrong amount in 2013-14 .

"A boy’s brain tumour ‘the size of a clementine’ was missed by doctors - and only discovered after his mother threatened to get out her chequebook and pay for a scan. Miles Davis, aged five, had suffered tell-tale signs including prolonged bouts of vomiting over nine months, once being sick every day for 18 days. He also had problems with his balance and the pupils of his eyes were dilated. Cheryl Davis, 42, threatened to pay for a private brain scan after . NHS doctors were hesitant to give one to her son. Miles, five, . pictured centre with his mother and his two brothers Lucas and Edward, . eventually had a scan - showing a tumour which could have been . there since birth . But Miles’s illness was initially dismissed as a vomiting syndrome and he was discharged from hospital at least four times. Doctors were reluctant to send him for a scan because of the risk posed by radiation. Miles’s mother Cheryl Davis, 42, from Bicester, Oxfordshire, said the scan was eventually ordered only after she ‘threw her toys out of the pram’. She recalled: ‘I said, ‘I want a brain scan and I will pay for it. It doesn’t matter how much it costs. I will get my chequebook out now and I will pay for a scan. If it comes back clear, you keep the cheque. If it comes back with something on it then you are paying for it. ‘I said ‘Where can I go privately for a scan?’ The doctor said ‘You do not need to do that’, and I said ‘I do because I keep saying there is something wrong with his head and nobody believes me'.' Her son’s case comes after statistics were released by the World Health Organisation (WHO) showing that the number of young people dying from brain tumours in the UK is the highest in Europe. The 12-13 week average time it takes to diagnose cases in the UK is 50 per cent slower than some other European countries, the WHO adds. Last year, about 500 people aged 2 - 24 were diagnosed with brain tumours and 125 died. Miles eventually received a scan, paid for by the NHS, at Horton General Hospital in Banbury, Oxfordshire. The scan was delayed for two days until the Monday as the procedure was not carried out on weekends . Miles eventually received a scan at Horton General Hospital in Banbury, Oxfordshire, without charge and on the NHS. The scan was delayed for two days until the Monday, as the procedure was not carried out at weekends. Mrs Davis said: ‘I carried Miles in on Monday morning. He couldn’t even walk at that point. He could not stand up any more. I was holding him in my arms as he was being sick. He was out with the fairies. ‘A tumour the size of a clementine was found, which the doctors said may have been growing since birth.’ Miles was transferred to Oxford’s John Radcliffe Hospital where he underwent surgery two days later. Although critical of Miles’s care before the scan, Mrs Davis said that from the moment the tumour was discovered in 2010, she ‘could not praise highly enough’ the swift treatment given to Miles which included rounds of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. 'When we spoke to other parents, they . were all saying they had to fight to get their children referred to . hospital. Yet the quicker the diagnosis of brain cancer, the greater the . chances of survival’ Cheryl Davis . When the cancer returned in Miles’s spine in May 2013, the family faced an agonising decision between localised radiotherapy or wider treatment on his spine and brain which could attack any undetected cancers but also carried a risk of brain damage. They took the risk - and it paid off. Now aged nine and nicknamed ‘Smiley Miley’ because of his positive attitude, Miles has scans every three months to check the cancer has not returned. Mrs Davis is calling on GPs to change their attitudes on admitting children for brain scans. She said: ‘We had been going in and out of the GP’s office for two weeks. We kept being told that he could be looked after in the community and that they could see nothing wrong with him, it was just a virus. 'I was saying: ‘We have had [this sickness] a lot throughout the year’. I insisted on [Miles] being admitted.’ Mrs Davis believes many GPs are ‘too reluctant’ to refer children to hospital - potentially delaying diagnosis in cancer cases which can affect chances of survival. She said: ‘It was not just us. When we spoke to other parents, they were all saying they had to fight to get their children referred to hospital. Yet the quicker the diagnosis of brain cancer, the greater the chances of survival.’ A charity, the Children’s Brain Tumour Foundation, has been set up by her and her husband, to raise awareness and fund child brain tumour research. And Mrs Davis is also urging GPs’ surgeries to carry cards provided by the Headsmart campaign, which detail the symptoms of brain tumours. Concern about Miles’s case was echoed by Sue Farrington Smith, chief executive of Brain Tumour Research. She said: ‘This is yet another example of a family facing immense stress as a result of the lack of awareness about brain tumours. People tell us far too often: ‘I had to fight to get the scan we needed to diagnose what we suspected all along’.' A spokeswoman for Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, which runs both the Horton General and the John Radcliffe hospitals, said: ‘Scans are undertaken when deemed clinically appropriate by the clinicians caring for the patient at the time. 'Clinicians always seek to avoid unnecessary exposure to x-rays in children.’","Miles Davis, five, from Bicester, had bouts of vomiting for nine months .

"Troubled singer George Michael has spent several days in hospital after falling ill suddenly, it emerged today. Two ambulances were sent to the 50-year-old's north London mansion after the star fell ill and a worried friend made a 999 call last Thursday. Michael - whose real name is Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou - nearly died from pneumonia in late 2011. Scroll down for video . Emergency: George Michael was rushed to hospital in an ambulance last Thursday after a worried friend made a call to 999 . His spokesman said today: 'In response to . newspaper reports today, we can confirm George was admitted to hospital . on May 22. He was discharged last weekend and is well and resting. He . is very much looking forward to the release of his new single in July. Given the personal nature of this matter there will be no further . comment.' Witnesses said the ambulances left four hours later with Michael on board. He was taken to a London hospital for emergency treatment. Big year: George Michael released his sixth solo album Syphonica . London Ambulance Service confirmed two ambulances were called at 8am on Thursday. ‘We . were called just before 8am on May 22. We sent two ambulance crews and . staff treated one patient, a man, who was then taken to hospital,’ a . spokesman for the ambulance service said. George Michael's co-writer and 'best mate' David Austin earlier arrived at the star's Hampstead home and scotched rumours the singer was ill. Austin, born David Mortimer, was a member of George Michael's first band 'The Executives' in 1981. He has also written and performed with his friend. He told reporters that his friend was 'perfectly fine' and had just finished recording a new demo tape. A neighbour who did not wish to be named added: 'He's getting better.' Fans have already taken to Twitter to voice their concerns for the pop icon. One user wrote: 'What's happened to my beloved @GeorgeMichael? reports coming in say he's been rushed to hospital :-( (sic)'. Another hoped 'nothing serious' had happened to Michael. Fears for the Careless Whisper singer's health have been raised in recent years due to a spate of illnesses, his regular cannabis use and due to a bizarre incident where he apparently fell out of a moving car on the M1 last year. The incident, which took place in May 2013, saw Michael airlifted to trauma hospital to treat a head injury. Just 18 months earlier the troubled singer had been close to death after being struck down with pneumonia in Vienna, but he fought back to perform again. Michael, whose hits also include Faith and Freedom, has had health scares and run-ins with the police linked to his drug use. Standstill: Paramedics treat George on the M1 after he fell out of his car onto the third lane of the carriageway at around 70mph near St Albans, Hertfordshire . In September 2010 Michael received an eight-week prison sentence following an incident the previous July in which he crashed his Range Rover into a shop in north London. He was also given a five-year driving ban after he pleaded guilty to driving under the influence of drugs and possessing cannabis. And he had earlier been banned from driving for two years and sentenced to 100 hours of community service in 2006 when he was convicted of driving while unfit through drugs after he was found collapsed in his Mercedes. Following his brush with pneumonia in late 2011, Michael made a tearful appearance outside his London home after flying back into the country and said it had been ""touch and go"" whether he lived.Doctors had performed a tracheotomy to keep his airways open and he was unconscious for some of his spell in hospital.

"The rightful owner of a £400,000 house handed to a squatter by a High Court judge today furiously asked: ‘How can this man sleep at night?’ Builder Keith Best spent several years renovating the three-bedroom semi-detached property but had lived in it for just a few months when he applied for permanent possession. The Chief Land Registrar turned him down but Mr Justice Ouseley overturned the ruling - despite accepting Best had been committing criminal trespass. Keith Best won the right to the house in Church Road, Ilford, east London after squatting in it for years . The registrar’s decision was ‘founded . on an error of law’, he said, and previous legislation that treated . squatting as a civil matter should apply. The house, in Newbury Park, north east London, originally belonged to widow Doris Curtis, who died aged 88 in the late 1980s. Her . shocked son Colin, 78, who lives in sheltered accommodation, revealed . he had no idea the house had been handed to a stranger until the Daily . Mail approached him after the hearing. The house formerly belonged to the mother of Colin Curtis, but he rarely visited after he was attacked in the area, neighbours say . ‘How . can this man sleep at night? I didn’t know a thing about this case or . that anyone had moved into the house,’ he said from his flat in Romford. The . former tube station kiosk owner moved into the house after getting . divorced in 1978 because his mother was getting ‘fragile’. He stayed there after she died and only left in 1996 when he inherited another property from an aunt. ‘I left the house as it was. I should have done something but there were a lot of personal problems,’ he added. ‘My daughter Susan died from breast cancer in 1990 and my son David died five ago aged 49 from liver disease.’ Despite . never visiting the house, he continued paying council tax until four . years ago when Redbridge Council sent a letter saying it was no longer . necessary. He added: ‘They . didn’t say why. I just assumed it was to do with the state of the house, . not that someone else was living there. They should have told me.’ Mr Curtis’s MP yesterday said the case raised concerns about the rights still given to squatters. Tory . Andrew Rosindell said: ‘This case highlights the need for further . examination of the law, which should give precedence to the rightful . owner of the property. The ruling means homeowners do not automatically have legal protection against someone who occupies their home . In September 2012 squatting in England and Wales became a criminal offence. Squatting in residential buildings can lead to six months in prison, a £5,000 fine, or both. Before it became a crime, squatters could take ownership of the property by virtue of having lived in it for a certain period of time. The duration in which a squatter needed to live in a property before they could apply to be registered as proprietor of the land was dependent on whether the land was registered or unregistered. Unregistered land meant a squatter could claim ownership after a period of 12 years adverse possession of it. If the land was registered land and they occupied it for 10 years they could apply to be registered owner of the land. If the squatter is not entitled to be registered, the registered owner then had two years to obtain possession against the squatter. If this did not happen - the squatter remained in possession and could apply once again for registration as owner. But in light of the new law, when Mr Best tried to register the land his request was blocked because squatting is now illegal. But following the judge's ruling, his case is now  a landmark victory for 'squatters' rights' as even though squatting is 'criminalised' by the Government he has still been allowed ownership. Source: Findlaw.co.uk . ‘If . you have a law which allows someone to grab a property - even if no one . bothers them - then it’s an open invitation for squatters.’ Mike Gapes, the Labour MP for Ilford South, added the court ruling raised ‘very serious issues’. ‘This . could set a precedent and will lead to protracted and difficult legal . disputes. The government needs to clarify the position urgently,’ he . said. Mr Best, 45, told the . High Court in London he was working on a property in 1997 when the owner . mentioned the occupant of a nearby house had died and her son had not . been seen for some time. He . began renovating the house and treated it ‘as his own’ from 2001, . although it was not until January 2012 that he moved in. Neighbours said . he parks a Mercedes car outside. His unsuccessful application for adverse possession to the Chief Land Registrar was submitted in . November that year - a few weeks after squatting was criminalised under . section 144 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act . 2012. The law was . introduced to stop the scandal of law-abiding owners being barred from . their own properties and having to pay expensive court costs to evict . squatters. But Mr Justice . Ouseley said it was intended to deal with squatters who ‘exploited the . civil law’s delays to fortify the house against the owner... at a cost . to [the owner] which was unlikely to be recovered’. Adverse . possession was still possible in any private property where at least . ten years had passed ‘without effective action by the owner’. The . registrar was ordered to make an interim cost payment of £100,000 to Mr . Best’s legal team, who brought the action on a no-win, no-fee basis. Total costs are expected to be in the region of £200,000. However, the judge did grant the right to appeal as his ruling will affect similar cases. Neighbours in Church Street were outraged by the decision. One, . who asked not to be named, said: ‘It’s totally wrong he [Best] has been . able to do this. He’s trespassed and got a free house out of it. ‘People are very angry - everyone else has had to save up and pay off their mortgage.’ The . Land Registry said the only enquiries it made were with the Probate . Registry to see if an executor of Mrs Curtis’s estate had been appointed . but ‘nothing was revealed’. After the hearing on Wednesday a man answering a phone registered to Mr Best claimed not to be him. He said: ‘He’s gone abroad - he left earlier today.’ Riz . Majid, of London law firm Neumans which represented Best, said: ‘The . judgement recognises that making residential squatting a criminal . offence was not intended to impact on the law of adverse possession.’","Builder Keith Best 'treated the house as his own' after hearing it was empty .

Ailsa Beaton, the Met’s former director of information, received £397,514 in 2012/13, nearly three times Prime Minister David Cameron’s £142,500 salary. Civilian employee Miss Beaton’s basic salary was just under £194,000, topped up with nearly £170,000 compensation for ‘loss of office’ and more than £33,000 in pension contributions. IT chief Ailsa Beaton was given a £170,000 payoff on top of her £194,000 salary from the Metropolitan Police in 2012/13 . Scotland Yard said it had a ‘contractual liability’ to give her the pay-off - despite a damning report published shortly after she left the force which said its ability to solve crime was being hampered by out-of-date technology dating back to the 1970s. The Metropolitan Police said the 56-year-old was given the settlement because she could not commit to the force for a long period while a major overhaul of computer systems takes place. According to a report by the London Assembly’s Budget and Performance Committee - published last August - the Met’s £250m IT budget is spent on ‘out-of-date, ineffective and overly-expensive’ technology. The report said: ‘The Met does not use technology as well as it could. It has built up its current provision over a number of years without a coherent strategy. Crime is higher as a result and criminals with smartphones often have better technology than London’s police officers.’ Miss Beaton’s pay package was revealed in the College of Policing’s annual report on pay and rewards. She had spent 12 years at Scotland Yard and was responsible for pushing use of social media such as Twitter and Facebook, and introducing new computer systems. Scotland Yard said it had a 'contractual liability' to give her the pay-off and says similar packages were given to 'hundreds of staff' Miss Beaton was awarded the OBE in 2010 for services to policing and, despite her pay-off, has continued working in the public sector as a non-executive member of the Information Commissioner’s Office. The College of Policing also revealed how some chief constables accepted performance-related bonuses last year. Norfolk Police’s former chief constable Phil Gormley accepted £58,038 on top of his £168,000 annual salary despite his force being one of the country’s smallest with 1,500 officers. Many other chief constables refused to take their bonuses. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘Miss Beaton received a voluntary exit payment in line with standard civil service terms. ‘This is the same package that has been, and continues to be, offered to many hundreds of Met staff as we seek to transform our organisation and reduce our service support costs. ‘Miss Beaton was eligible to depart under a voluntary exit arrangement because of a new corporate direction regarding our IT transformation and its requirement for sustained leadership over a longer period than Miss Beaton could reasonably commit to.’","IT boss Ailsa Beaton given £170,000 payoff on top of £194,000 salary .

"Nick Clegg has sparked outrage by defending the taxpayer-funded £1.25million house lived in by hate preacher Abu Hamza’s family. The Deputy Prime Minister rejected demands to cut benefits for the hook-handed cleric’s wife and children after he was convicted of 11 terror offences in the U.S. The firebrand – who for years spouted evil on Britain’s streets – is expected to die behind bars after a jury in New York found him guilty of aiding the kidnapping of hostages in Yemen in which three Britons were killed and trying to set up an Al Qaeda training camp in Oregon. Scroll down for video . Guilty verdict: Hate preacher Abu Hamza, 56, who was extradited from the UK in 2012, was found guilty of terrorism offences in New York . It emerged yesterday that Hamza’s wife . Najat Mostafa, 55, and some of their eight children continue to live . rent-free in a five-bedroom home in upmarket Shepherd’s Bush, West . London. The family are understood to be raking in at least £650 a week in housing and child benefits – a total of £33,800 a year. Four of Hamza’s sons and a stepson have served time in jail – two for terrorism offences. But on his call-in radio show . yesterday, Liberal Democrats leader Mr Clegg defended the family’s right . to be housed at an extortionate cost to the British taxpayer.

He said he understood people’s . ‘frustrations’, but added: ‘He’s been convicted, he’s going to serve . time in prison. It’s not his family, they’ve not decided to take action . against his family. ‘If they’ve committed any wrongdoing, . if they’ve broken the law, then charges should be brought against them . much like anybody else.’ Tory MPs said Mr Clegg was ‘out of touch’ with hard-pressed British families. In court: Hamza, pictured in a court sketch taken from last month, is expected to die behind bars . Hiding in plain sight: Abu Hamza, sketched giving testimony earlier this month, was accused by the judge of hiding his terror message behind his religion . Tory MP Peter Bone, who represents . Wellingborough, Northants, said: ‘Taxpayers up and down the country will . be grossly offended that the family of a convicted terrorist is being . kept in the lap of luxury at taxpayers’ expense. ‘Why do they have to be housed in . London, why in this kind of accommodation? You would be able to buy half . a street in Wellingborough for that. ‘It makes the law of this land an ass when people can rip off taxpayers in this way. ‘We are hamstrung by the . bleeding-heart Liberals, in particular Nick Clegg, who are just so out . of touch with the British people.’ Greg Hands, Tory MP for Chelsea and . Fulham, urged Hammersmith and Fulham Council to take action. He said: ‘I . think it’s right for the council to look at this situation in the light . of the conviction and see what action could be taken.’ Hamza's second wife Najat Mostafa, 55, with whom he has seven children, lives in a £1.25million five-bedroom council house in Shepherd's Bush . There was growing anger last night that Abu Hamza’s family are continuing to be bankrolled by the British public. As the hate preacher was convicted of 11 terror offences in the U.S., it emerged his wife and children are still being housed at an extortionate cost in one of the most upmarket areas of the country. It is thought the family have cost taxpayers more than £3million in benefits and social housing, as well as legal fees for Hamza and his sons. Hamza’s second wife Najat Mostafa, 55, with whom he has seven children, lives in a £1.25 million five-bedroom council house in Shepherd’s Bush, West London – an area popular with bankers and City lawyers. Last night, neighbours said they were ‘sickened’ the family were continuing to benefit from state handouts. Hamza, 58, has nine children – seven sons and two daughters. His eldest son Mohamed Mostafa, 32, was jailed for his part in planning to blow up churches in Yemen on Christmas Day 1998. He was jailed again in 2008, along with his brother Hamza Kamel, now 27, for their part in a £1 million luxury car scam. Hamza’s fifth son Imran Mostafa, 20, was jailed for 11 years in 2012 for armed robbery. Another son, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was jailed in February for 12 years for conspiracy to kidnap and conspiracy to commit false imprisonment. Hamza Kamel . Mohammed Mostafa . Imran Mostafa . Hamza's second wife Najat Mostafa, 55, with whom he has seven children, lives in a £1.25-million five-bedroom council house in Shepherd's Bush . A neighbour of the family said yesterday: ‘What would they do in America? Put the terrorist’s family up for free in a gorgeous road where everyone else has worked hard to live there? I don’t think so.’ Another neighbour said: ‘Given how hard it is for hard-working Britons to get on the housing market in London, it is sickening how easy it has been for them.’ Scaffolder Grant Lawrence, 28, who was working on the street yesterday, said: ‘I work hard and I can’t get on the property ladder. It is disgusting. ‘It is sickening that a terrorist’s family are living here and we are all paying for it.’ THE DEPUTY . U.S. prosecutors want to put Haroon Aswat on trial for allegedly helping the hook-handed cleric establish a terrorist training camp in Oregon in 1999 . Britain has spent £3million trying to deport the man thought to be Abu Hamza’s lieutenant on terror charges, but is being thwarted by human rights laws, it emerged last night. U.S. prosecutors want to put Haroon Aswat on trial for allegedly helping the hook-handed cleric establish a terrorist training camp in Oregon in 1999. Hamza was convicted of setting up the camp – which provided training for jihadists headed for Afghanistan – on Monday. But Aswat, who is detained in Broadmoor high-security hospital, has thwarted his own extradition by using the European Convention on Human Rights, on the grounds he is mentally unfit to be detained in an American jail. The case, which dates back to 2005, has already landed the taxpayer with a £3 million bill – including £2.25 million to keep Aswat in custody while he fights removal. In Broadmoor, he takes part in workshops and is studying for an Open University degree, at a cost of £325,000 a year. The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg has said he cannot be sent to the US in case his fragile mental health deteriorates. In a judgment last month, the ruling was upheld by the High Court. Yorkshire-born Aswat is alleged to have travelled to Oregon to help set up a jihadi training camp run by James Ujaama. His trip was said to have been organised by Hamza to equip recruits to go to Afghanistan and fight.After leaving the US, Aswat travelled to Afghanistan, Pakistan and South Africa before being detained in Nairobi in 2005. He was extradited to Britain and has since been held in custody, moving from a high-security prison to Broadmoor in 2008 when he began to suffer from schizophrenia. The case has revived calls for reform of human rights law. Tory MP Peter Bone said: ‘There does seem to be something very wrong with how the law is working. ‘I know the law is an ass but in this instance it seems to be outrageous.’","Deputy Prime Minister rejected demands to cut benefits for cleric's family .

"On trial: Reverend Nathan Ntege, 54, claimed he married large numbers of illegal immigrants because he feared they would 'live in sin', court told . A vicar who ran an alleged sham wedding racket was ‘fast-tracked’ because the Church of England wanted more black clergy, a court heard yesterday. Reverend Nathan Ntege did not have training in the law surrounding marriages when he was appointed as a parish priest, his trial was told. But officials thought he brought ‘a bit of colour to proceedings’ in the Church, a senior clergyman said. Ntege, 55, is accused of presiding over a ‘matrimonial conveyor belt’, where migrants from outside the European Union are said to have married those with the right to remain in Britain before applying to the Home Office to stay here themselves. The prosecution alleges that the plot was ‘an industrial-scale abuse of the system of immigration control within the UK’ but lawyers for Ntege questioned if he had been made a ‘scapegoat’ for a wider problem. Ntege started working at St Jude’s in Thornton Heath, South London, in 2002 and became the parish vicar in 2007. The former Archdeacon of Croydon, Vincent Davies, said vicars normally served a form of apprenticeship but that Ntege had not done so because he previously worked in a cathedral in Uganda. He said Ntege’s lack of experience meant he struggled with rules and paperwork but added: ‘Because we were trying to appoint more black and African clergy, the bishop said it was something that we needed to take account of.’ He said: ‘One of his great benefits was that he was not Church of England background… Whereas we are considered quite grey and dull, he brought a bit of colour to proceedings, which changed things... for the better.’ He told the court Ntege, who came to the church from Uganda in 2002, had difficulties sticking to the laws in England. 'Having been trained abroad, Ntege did not have a sure grasp of the rules of the Church of England and how it applied to a Parish Priest,; he said. He said he challenged Ntege during a visit to the church in 2007 about the number of marriages happening there, and questioned whether the correct procedures were being carried out. Archdeacon Davies said: 'Ntege's reply to me was ""What I'm trying to achieve is so no-one feels they are not living outside the law of God and church, by living together without being married"". 'He told me living in his country without being married was considered sinful, so he wanted to get as many people married as possible. 'I said it was very commendable but it must be carried out by the law of England, not law of Uganda. I reminded him of his duties as a registrar and he could be sent to prison if he did not observe the law. 'It is true the clergy are not immigration officers, but the priest must make every effort to ensure marriage is lawful and the procedures are observed so the marriage is not void. Not taking care of procedures means all sorts of problems can occur.' Women were seen queuing out of the door at St Jude's and St Aidan's in Thornton Heath, south London, pictured, while other brides got changed in the garden, the court heard . He said he had been to the church in 2004 to check the records and found Ntege was not filling them out correctly, in that he was filling out one copy of the register instead of the two he was meant to. He said: 'I spent three days going through the records with him, showing him how to fill them out correctly. 'He introduced me to his registrar, Maudlyn Riviere, and I told him she could not be the registrar because he could not delegate the registrar's duties. 'But apart from the hiccup with the registrar he seemed to be doing a very fine job.' He called Ntege a 'good friend' and said he was a very 'spiritual and dynamic person', adding: 'He was a good man and the Bishop had confidence in him.' He added: 'The increase in baptisms was proportional to the increase in weddings and the increase in the congregation. It became a very thriving church. It doubled in size. 'When a church grows exponentially some administrative errors occur. We say get the marriage law right and we can help with other matters.' Witnesses: Archdeacon Vincent Anthony Davies said Ntebe told him 'living together without being married was sinful' while former church warden Alexander Robb said weddings went from '5 weddings a year to 10 a week' Archdeacon Davies said the Diocese of Southwark and other dioceses in London had been plagued by a rise in sham marriages, leading to the Archdeacons and Bishops writing letters to warn all the priests in the Diocese of the correct procedures. He said: 'The practice of sham marriages was not widespread, but it happened. 'There was a wedding between a Nigerian and a Portuguese woman of easy virtue at another church, which was stopped. There were gangs of people roaming around doing this.' When prompted by Ntege's defence lawyer Gelaga King, Archdeacon Davies remembered Ntege had come to him with concerns about eight marriages that he considered could be sham. He said: 'It led me to believe he was following the rules because he was bringing important things to my attention.' Alexander Robb, who has been a member of the church since 1939 and had acted as church warden and vice chairman of the Parochial Parish council, also gave evidence. He described Ntege as a man of 'integrity and principle' but said he favoured Ugandans and Ugandan customs at the expense of his other parishioners. He also remarked on the number of marriages happening in the community and his surprise at their 'remarkable increase'. Ringleader: Rev Ntege is accused of pocketing £70,000 and sending huge sums back to his native Uganda . Mr Robb said 'Ntege came to the church in 2002, he had new ideas in the running of the church. 'In the early days he asked me to be a mentor to remind me about how things used to be in the church. We worked very closely together until he started to go his own way, this disintegrated slightly. 'When he arrived at the church we got on splendidly, he called me 'Papa Alex'. We were good friends, but this tended to change when his way of doing things moved away from what I was used to. 'The number of marriages went from four or five weddings a year to 10 a week, there were two a day some days. 'When Nathan Ntege was introduced to the church he said he would support the Ugandan population over here. Most of the people being married were not members of our church, they were strangers to us. I didn't recognise any of the brides or grooms and did not see them again. 'I had the job of reading out the banns in church. They were difficult to read. I had problems pronouncing some of the names which gave quite a bit of amusement.' The number of marriages in the church and other changes in procedure meant he was elected to send a letter in 2009 to the bishop, saying they were worried about the way things were being done in the church. Mr Robb said: 'It was a result of old members of church feeling something was not quite right. We mentioned the large number of weddings and the fact the accounts had not been produced for three years. 'The pastoral care suffered, the problem was so much time was taken up by weddings that he didn't get round to the rest of his duties as he should have done.' However, he said the population of the church itself had doubled in the time, which could have led to an increase in the number of marriages. He added: 'In one year we had the biggest number of confirmations in the country, 57.' Seven defendants deny a total of 51 charges relating to immigration offences. The trial continues.

"Way back when he first made a living as a disc jockey spinning turntables, it might have spelled disaster. These days digital music means there’s not much Tony Blackburn has to do with his thumb, not even a badly injured one, except to give a cheery thumbs up to his diehard fans. The 71-year-old DJ had a painful argument with his electronically controlled garage door - and came off worse. DJ Tony Blackburn showed off his bandaged thumb during an appearance on Sky News. The 71-year-old accidentally caught it in his electronically-controlled garage door at his home in Hertfordshire on Monday . He got his left thumb trapped between the door and a wall when he was closing it on Monday at his home in Hertfordshire. ‘I quickly pulled it out otherwise I would have lost it,’ he explained yesterday. ‘I was very brave though.’ The broadcaster and former I’m a Celebrity ‘king of the jungle’ titleholder was rushed to the accident and emergency department of his local hospital by his wife Debra, where he was given nine stitches and a bandage. Yesterday on Sky TV he praised the NHS, revealed that he didn’t cry - and that he ‘got a sweetie’ afterwards for being a good boy. Holding the cartoon-style thumb aloft he joked: ‘The great thing is that it isn’t noticeable.’ The veteran DJ, whose mother was a nurse and father a GP, began his career on Radio Caroline when the pirate ship began broadcasting in 1964 and spun the first disc to launch Radio 1 three years later. Tony Blackburn praised the NHS following his trip to A&E where he received nine stitches in his thumb following the mishap . He has since hosted a succession of radio shows and is the first person in the history of British radio’s top awards to win a lifetime achievement award twice. Yesterday at home, where the offending garage door is visible from the road, he was recording an interview about his half century in broadcasting. His agent Nick Canham told the Daily Mail: ‘He genuinely doesn’t know how it happened - he just shut the garage door and his hand became trapped in the side of it.’ Mr Blackburn was right handed, he confirmed - and would normally use that hand to spin discs anyway. The mishap comes after another recent hospital visit, in which he was treated for sciatica in one leg. He tweeted afterwards that he had watched ten ‘ten Corries’ while recuperating. Yesterday he told his 34,000 Twitter followers what happened with his thumb and added: ‘Thanks NHS!’ Recent figures from the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) suggest nearly 5,000 injuries a year are caused by electronic garage doors and of those, hundreds of victims needed hospital treatment.","Tony Blackburn needed nine stitches after trapping thumb in garage door .

"Andy Coulson, who is being investigated over whether he had hidden assets as Crown prosecutors try to recoup £750,000 . Disgraced Tory spin doctor Andy Coulson is being investigated over whether he has hidden assets as Crown prosecutors try to recoup £750,000 in costs from him. The 46-year-old, jailed for 18 months for phone hacking, must account for millions of pounds received after he quit as News of the World editor in 2007. Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC said: ‘A lot of money passed through Mr Coulson’s hands and there doesn’t seem to be very much left. We want to investigate where the money has gone.’ Coulson received a £600,000 settlement when he resigned as editor of the News of the World and was recruited by the Tories months later as director of communications on £475,000 a year, which fell to £180,000 when he moved to No10 in 2010. The married father-of-three resigned as Mr Cameron’s spin doctor in January 2011 and set up a PR consultancy with his wife Eloise but has not worked full-time since he was charged with phone hacking in 2012. His legal costs in the trial were covered by his former employers at News International, the publishers of the News of the World, after he took the firm to the High Court to force them to pay. It is not clear if the Rupert Murdoch newspaper empire will also cover his share of the CPS costs. If it does not the court will assess Coulson’s own assets. His assets include his family home in Preston, Kent, which he shares with his wife and three young sons, although it would be unusual for a family home to be seized to cover CPS costs. The couple sold their £1.5million five-bedroom Victorian home in Forest Hill, South London, after he was charged and downsized to a £600,000 house near Canterbury. Mr Edis said the prosecution would investigate if other assets had been hidden. He told the Old Bailey: ‘In a situation such as this, where someone anticipates they might be convicted having been charged in 2012, it is not at all uncommon for transfers of money to take place whereby they are no longer in his ownership but might still be accessible to him if the need should arise.’ Coulson was convicted of phone hacking following an eight-month trial and was given an 18-month jail sentence. Coulson, pictured with wife Eloise, was convicted of phone hacking following an eight-month trial and was given an 18-month jail sentence . His co-accused Rebekah Brooks, her husband Charlie and former News of the World managing editor Stuart Kuttner were all acquitted and have asked for their defence costs to be paid by public funds. Their applications are due to be considered at a hearing later this year. Mr Edis warned the bill to the taxpayer could run to millions of pounds. Coulson and former royal editor Clive Goodman face a possible retrial on two charges of making illegal payments to police officers, on which the jury failed to reach verdicts. Coulson has been held in top-security Belmarsh Prison in South East London while a decision is made over the retrial. Trial judge Mr Justice Saunders said he was ‘concerned’ that Coulson was still in Belmarsh and would write to the prison governor. A non-violent criminal serving a comparatively short sentence would normally only be taken to Belmarsh for assessment before being transferred to a lower security jail. Mr Justice Saunders said: ‘I am concerned to hear that Mr Coulson is remaining at Belmarsh because of the possibility of the retrial taking place. ‘I think that the governor should be informed that any retrial there should be – if there were to be one – is some way down the line.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Former News of the World editor was jailed for 18 months for phone hacking .

"City executive Rona Fairhead will appear before a Commons select committee next week before a final decision is reached over the BBC Trust role . The Government’s preferred candidate to take over as the BBC’s first female chairman is to face a grilling from MPs. City executive Rona Fairhead will appear before a Commons select committee next week before a final decision is reached over the BBC Trust role. The former head of the Financial Times group has been approved by the Prime Minister to succeed Lord Patten. If confirmed in the post, she will be paid £110,000 a year for a three-day working week. But Tory MP Philip Davies, a member of the culture, media and sport select committee, said she faced questions over her role as a non-executive director on the board of banking giant HSBC. The banking group was fined £1.2billion in 2012 for breaching US money-laundering laws and was described as the ‘bank of choice’ for Mexican drug gangs. Mr Davies said: ‘I want to know what she knew about that scandal and what she did to try to prevent it and what she did to investigate it. ‘Second, there is a question mark over her lack of experience in broadcasting and the regulation of broadcasting, which are obviously key elements of being the BBC Trust chairman.’ Another member of the committee, Conor Burns, has suggested ministers were ‘determined’ to appoint a woman to the role. Mr Davies added: ‘We need to ask if she only got the job because she is a woman. I am not saying that Rona Fairhead is the wrong candidate, but our job as a committee is to ask searching questions of any candidate who is put forward for this job.’ The 53-year-old mother of three could also face questions over her political links, having been appointed as a British business ambassador by David Cameron earlier this year. She was a non-executive member of the Cabinet Office board but stood down when she was selected as the preferred candidate to chair the BBC Trust. Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood was on the preliminary interview panel for candidates for the BBC Trust role. Her husband Tom, a director of the private equity firm Campbell Lutyens, is a former Tory councillor in the West London borough of Kensington and Chelsea. The Government has stressed that she was selected following ‘an open recruitment process’ overseen by an independent public appointments assessor. Tory MP Philip Davies, a member of the culture, media and sport select committee, said she is facing questions over her role as a non-executive director on the board of banking giant HSBC . After questioning Mrs Fairhead on Tuesday of next week, members of the Commons select committee will vote on whether they believe she is a suitable candidate and their decision will be put before Mr Cameron for final approval. She was chairman and chief executive of the Financial Times for seven years and received a £1.1million pay-off when she left last year. As well as her HSBC role, she is a non-executive director of soft drinks giant PepsiCo. The BBC will consider whether any of her external roles could represent a conflict of interest. Mrs Fairhead holds a first-class degree in law from Cambridge University and has an MBA from Harvard Business School. She was recently tipped as a future chairman of Barclays. According to the Sunday Times, Mrs Fairhead expressed a willingness to consider changes to the BBC licence fee when she was interviewed by Culture Secretary Sajid Javid. She said: ‘The BBC is a great British institution packed with talented people, and I’m honoured to have the opportunity to be chairman of the BBC Trust.’ Lord Patten announced in May that he would be standing down as chairman of the BBC Trust following heart surgery. The previous frontrunner to succeed him, Lord Coe, pulled out of the race because he said he could not balance the job with his other commitments. Mother they called Airhead who fought all the way to the top . By GUY ADAMS . Rona Fairhead was made chairman and chief executive of The Financial Times in 2006 . When you shatter glass ceilings, it helps to have thick skin. That’s something Rona Fairhead has had to learn the hard way on her journey to the brink of becoming the first woman to lead the BBC in its 91-year history. At the Financial Times, where she was made chairman and chief executive in 2006, boorish male journalists nicknamed her ‘Rona Airhead’, in the belief that she owed the job to gender-based tokenism rather than talent. Now, male MPs are making similar noises, with Conor Burns, a Tory who sits on the Commons committee that will vote on her appointment, expressing ‘enormous’ regret ‘that the Government seems determined to appoint a woman simply because it’s a woman, rather than go out and find the best person’. Others, including Conservative Philip Davies, have voiced concerns about her involvement in recent pay-off and money-laundering controversies and lack of experience in broadcasting. There are also dark rumours of political cronyism. Mrs Fairhead, who was educated at Yarm Grammar School and still speaks with a hint of her native Teesside, is married to wealthy merchant banker Tom Fairhead, who is a former councillor and senior figure in Kensington and Chelsea Tory circles. The couple, who have two teenage sons, and a teenage daughter, live in a £4million home in Holland Park, West London. They are friendly with George Osborne and his wife, Frances. Mrs Fairhead’s links to the Cameroonian establishment extend to her agreeing to become one of the PM’s ‘business ambassadors’. She also sat on the board of the Cabinet Office alongside Sir Jeremy Heywood, Britain’s top civil servant, who is regarded as the most powerful backstage fixer in Downing Street. Strangely, given the need for the BBC appointment process to be seen as unimpeachable, Sir Jeremy happens to have been the most senior member of the selection board which interviewed her for the new job. Quite what the members of the Commons culture, media and sport committee will make of this incestuousness when they interview her next week is anyone’s guess. Yet if history is any guide, Mrs Fairhead, will take criticism on the chin. She has, after all spent the last 30 years on a sharp-elbowed climb through the boardrooms of corporate Britain. A tenacious professional, who cut her teeth as a management consultant, she has spent the past two years battling breast cancer, while holding down directorships of PepsiCo and HSBC, along with the Cabinet Office role. Former Whitehall mandarin Ian Watmore yesterday described her as ‘a class act… tough, ethical and likeable’. She is on the brink of becoming the first woman to lead the BBC in its 91-year history . Mrs Fairhead joined the Financial Times, as chief financial officer in 2002, and began to achieve public prominence as a protégé of Marjorie Scardino, who had in 1997 become the first female FTSE 100 chief executive as boss of the title’s parent firm, Pearson. Mrs Fairhead’s time at the FT’s helm, from 2006 onwards, saw the newspaper become hugely-profitable. But she decided to leave the company in 2012, after failing to be appointed to succeed Dame Marjorie. Although the move was voluntary, the firm gave her a pay-off of £1.1 million, and allowed her to keep millions more in share options. That prompted a shareholder rebellion which saw 37 per cent refuse to endorse Pearson’s remuneration report. The controversy has eerie parallels with that which engulfed the BBC Trust last year, over revelations that senior managers had been given £1.4 million in unnecessarily big pay-offs. Mrs Fairhead, who describes her hobbies in Debrett’s as ‘skiing, scuba diving, flying and family’, has never publicly discussed the affair. If confirmed in her new post, she must not only restore public confidence in the credibility of a BBC Trust severely compromised by the Jimmy Savile affair, but also oversee negotiations for the renewal of the Corporation’s charter, which is due to expire in 2016. It’s an unenviable job, but – as woman with a meteoric career and as a member of Bournemouth Flying Club – Rona Fairhead will relish the challenge.","Rona Fairhead will appear before a Commons select committee next week .

"Dan Evans, pictured, admitted hacking phones at the Sunday Mirror and the News of the World . A journalist who hacked more than 1,000 voicemails was spared jail yesterday after he gave evidence against former Downing Street spin doctor Andy Coulson. Dan Evans, 38, admitted hacking phones at the Sunday Mirror and the News of the World and said former tabloid editor Coulson sanctioned the hacking. He was given a 10-month sentence for hacking some 200 celebrities and politicians, and for illegal payments to public officials and perverting the course of justice, but the sentence was suspended for a year. Mr Justice Saunders said he was not sending Evans to prison because he had admitted his crimes and had agreed a deal with the Crown Prosecution Service to give evidence against others. Evans was a witness during the recent trial in which Coulson, 46, was convicted and given an 18-month jail sentence for phone hacking. Evans claimed he was recruited to the News of the World in 2005 to target the voicemail messages of celebrities and politicians and said the illegal hacking was so widespread that ‘even the office cat’ knew. He admitted two charges of hacking and also confessed to paying a prison guard for information about Soham murderer Ian Huntley, and paying a policeman for details about EastEnders actor Steve McFadden. The information included a tip that former school caretaker Huntley was an avid fan of BBC1 show Strictly Come Dancing, the Old Bailey heard. Evans, a married father-of-two, also pleaded guilty to lying in a witness statement in a High Court case brought against the now defunct Sunday tabloid by interior designer Kelly Hoppen, in which he denied attempting to hack her phone in 2009. Mr Justice Saunders ordered Evans to complete 200 hours of unpaid community service and but said he would spare him a prison sentence. He said: ‘In the circumstances of this case and in particular the co-operation that Mr Evans has given and has agreed to give the police and the prosecution in the future, as compared with the lack of co-operation of others, I do feel able to suspend the sentence.’ Dan Evans was spared jail after he gave evidence against former Downing Street spin doctor Andy Coulson, pictured . In a separate case, a chauffeur and three security guards who worked for News International were cleared of an alleged cover-up over the phone hacking scandal. The four men were accused of conspiring with Rebekah Brooks and her husband Charlie to pervert the course of justice – a charge which Mr and Mrs Brooks were acquitted of at their trial. The CPS said it would offer no evidence against the men and they were formally acquitted, after spending more than two years on bail.","Dan Evans admitted hacking phones at Sunday Mirror and News of the World .

"Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick, the Met's most senior female police officer, attended one of the training courses while at Thames Valley Police, which spent £28,000 on them over six years . Police forces have spent almost £470,000 on training courses run by a group dubbed a ‘left-wing Freemasons’. Senior officers attended classes run by charity Common Purpose. Its trustees include a co-founder of the group behind the Hacked Off campaign for Press reform. The Metropolitan Police – which is leading investigations into alleged corruption and phone hacking at newspapers – has spent £60,000 on the leadership courses.

"Charities could be forced to declare their spending on campaigns amid fears they have become too political, it was revealed yesterday. Under changes proposed by the regulator, charities would have to declare how much of their income comes from the Government, and their annual campaign spend. The proposals follow concerns that some charities have used millions of pounds of public money to subsidise politically driven campaigns. A recent study by the Institute of Economic Affairs found many well-known charities had used taxpayers’ cash to push for causes ‘which are not priorities for the electorate and are often unpopular’. Oxfam was criticised for this campaign which was accused of being too political for spoke out against Government spending cuts . Current rules allow charities to campaign provided they do not back individual political parties or candidates, but MPs have raised concerns that some recent campaigns have been politically driven. The Charity Commission is considering a complaint from Conservative MP Conor Burns that Oxfam’s recent anti-poverty campaign was ‘overtly political’. A mock film poster produced by the charity carried the slogan: ‘The perfect storm… starring zero hours contracts, high prices, benefits cuts, unemployment, childcare costs.’ The aid charity spent £18million on ‘campaigning and advocacy’ in the 2012-3 financial year – seven per cent of its annual expenditure, according to its most recent accounts. It received £34million in funding from the Government in the same period. It denied the ‘perfect storm’ publicity was political and said it had a duty to highlight hardship in Britain. Conservative MPs have also raised concerns over the alleged ‘politicisation of poverty’ surrounding food banks in Britain and have claimed that some charities have been used as vehicles for a pro-Labour agenda. Child care charity the Family and Childcare Trust faced criticism after it posted a series of tweets with the hashtag #childcarecrisis, which has been used by the Labour Party. The RSPCA was accused of politically motivated prosecutions of hunt supporters after it brought a £326,000 private prosecution against the Heythrop Hunt in David Cameron’s Oxfordshire constituency. Donations to the charity dropped by more than £7million after it was criticised for spending donors’ money on controversial political issues including hunting, badger culls and horse racing pursuing. The charity said its spending on prosecutions was separate to its campaigning budget. A spokesman said campaigning accounted for less than one per cent of the charity’s total budget in 2013. It has hired a senior lawyer to review its prosecutions policy, following the Heythrop private prosecution. Charities already publish annual reports showing income and expenditure, but the Charity Commission proposals would require greater breakdowns on spending on campaigns and income from Government. Donations to the RSPCA dropped by £7million after they took members of the Heythrop Hunt, in David Cameron's old constituency, to court (file pic) The regulator said it had completed a consultation process and expected to reach a decision in October. Its own research into public trust and confidence in the charity sector has found overall trust remains high but revealed a slight decrease in trust over charities’ independence. Fewer people believed that ‘most charities are trustworthy and act in the public interest’ – 71 per cent in 2014 compared to 75 per cent in 2010 – and there was also a slight drop in the number of people who believed charities could be trusted to work independently. A member of the commission’s board, Gwythian Prins, said the public’s perception of charity campaigns had changed. He said last year: ‘The weather has changed. The public expects charities to stick to their knitting. ‘Problems arise when charities push the envelope. If a charity campaigns about matters that appear to be outside its objects, then we will look at it.’ But charities have warned the regulator’s proposals are an attempt to silence them and have called on the Charity Commission to abandon the proposed changes. Sir Stephen Bubb, the head of the ACEVO group which represents charity leaders, said: ‘This is not just a question of free speech but also of fostering a culture of public decision-making based upon evidence and giving a voice to the voiceless in public debate. ‘What we say may make uncomfortable listening but those in government who close their ears ought to be ashamed.’ The Charity Finance Group, which represents finance officers in the sector, said the changes would lead to confusion and would place an ‘unnecessary burden’ on charities. But Tories welcomed the proposed changes. Charlie Elphicke (corr), Conservative MP for Dover, said: ‘It’s right that charities should be transparent in terms of the money they get from the Government and how they spend it. ‘People want to know that charities walk the walk and really help people on the frontline, rather than just talk the talk.’","Oxfam and Family and Childcare Trust criticised for political campaigns .

"Risk: Eloise Coulson, pictured with her convicted husband, could lose the property in Preston Kent . For eight months she has endured the humiliation of her husband’s disgrace and revelations about his affair with Rebekah Brooks. Now Eloise Coulson could face losing her family’s home as the prosecution seek to recoup almost £750,000 in costs for the phone hacking trial. The Crown Prosecution Service spent £1.7million bringing Andy Coulson, Mrs Brooks and four others to trial. Coulson, 46, is hoping to force his former employers in the Rupert Murdoch media empire to pay his share but if he fails the CPS has said it would look to his ‘assets’ to recover its costs. It is understood they could include his family home in Preston, Kent, which he shares with his wife and three young sons. The couple have already sold their £1.5million five-bedroom Victorian home in Forest Hill, South London, after he was charged, and downsized to a £600,000 house near Canterbury. Mrs Coulson, 42, accompanied Coulson to court regularly during the eight-month trial but has not been seen at his side at the Old Bailey since his conviction last week. Coulson – who earned a reported £475,000-a-year as the Conservatives’ director of communications – is also facing a retrial on allegations he made corrupt payments to public officials. He and Mrs Brooks began an affair in 1998 and admitted it had been rekindled at least twice after his marriage to PR consultant Eloise in 2000. Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC said: ‘Mr Coulson has a number of assets which have a financial value. One of them is an indemnity.’ Coulson’s ‘indemnity’ from his ex-employers News International, now News UK, means the firm has been forced to pay his legal bills. He took them to court in August 2011 after they stopped the payments and he successfully argued they had a legal duty to continue to cover his legal fees. It is not clear if the firm will have to cover his share of the CPS costs, or any ongoing legal fees. Costs are due to be decided in a two-day hearing later this month. Case: Coulson - who earned a reported £475,000-a-year as the Conservatives’ director of communications - is also facing a retrial on allegations he made corrupt payments to public officials . So far, only news editor James Weatherup has been ordered to pay a £5,000 share of prosecution costs. A legal source said it would be unusual for a family home to be seized to cover CPS costs, but said the cost of the trial was unusually high. Meanwhile, Mrs Brooks, her husband Charlie, her former assistant Cheryl Carter, former News of the World managing editor Stuart Kuttner and News International security chief Mark Hanna have all asked for their defence costs to be paid by public funds after they were all acquitted.

"When Michelle Hui was told she had lost her baby in a miscarriage after six weeks of pregnancy, her world descended into a nightmarish blur. After enduring five separate scans to confirm the devastating news, she was given abortion drugs to prevent any infection in her body. Mrs Hui was then told she had potentially dangerous blood clots in her womb  and would have to have surgery to remove them. Miracle baby: Michelle Hui, pictured with her 18-week-old baby Megan who she didn't know she was pregnant with, after suffering a miscarriage and taking abortion pills . Kisses! When Michelle went in for an operation on her uterus, doctors found a heartbeat. Megan Hui was born in February weighing just under 6lbs and is now thriving at 18 weeks old . But as doctors prepared to perform  this final procedure, a scan picked up a tiny heartbeat. The . astonished medical team told Mrs Hui that her baby had managed to . survive both the miscarriage and the abortion pills – and she could . continue with the pregnancy. They said she had been pregnant with twins, and while one baby died, the other had clung on to life. The blood clots could have created shadows on the scan images, obscuring the surviving foetus from view,  doctors said. In February Mrs Hui, 31, and her husband Ross, 33, welcomed their ‘miracle’ daughter Megan into the family. Weighing a healthy six pounds, she has continued to thrive at home with her sister Mya, four, and brother Noah, two. The family have since been told that Megan’s story is so extraordinary that it has been written up in medical journals. Mrs . Hui said: ‘The miscarriage and abortion were absolutely horrific. The . ten days between the miscarriage and going back to the hospital were . just a blur. ‘But . then I saw this little heartbeat. I thought it couldn’t be right. After . all we had been through, I didn’t want to  get my hopes up. The doctor . went out and came back in with a more senior doctor and he did the scan . again and he said, “You are not going to believe it, we’ve got a . heartbeat”. It was the best feeling ever. ‘Now . Megan is fine. She is just a big healthy pudding of a baby. The doctors . said it was a blessing. They have never heard of anything like it. Someone had been looking over us.’ She was six weeks pregnant when she began bleeding as she walked to  work, and feared she was suffering  a miscarriage. She went to hospital where two  different doctors had carried out five scans before concluding she had lost  her baby. She . was given two abortion drugs – known as a medical abortion because it . does not involve surgery – to prompt her womb to expel the dead foetus . to prevent any infection. Further . tests showed there were blood clots in her womb so doctors prepared to . perform a surgical procedure to remove them – until a scan showed . Megan’s heartbeat. Bundle of joy: 'She is fine, she is healthy and she is just a big healthy pudding of a baby,' says Michelle Hui of her 18-week old baby Megan, pictured here . Beautiful baby: Megan Hui, 18 weeks old, is known as a miracle baby after her twin died in a miscarriage but she survived . Although . the case is rare, medical abortions have a higher failure rate  than . surgical terminations – up to 14 in every 1,000, although some studies . suggest it could be as high as 4 per cent. And in one in 100 cases, the womb is not entirely cleared and further medical intervention is necessary. Mrs . Hui, of Co Kildare, Ireland, told the Sunday Mirror she was angry that . doctors at the Rotunda Hospital in Dublin had failed to spot the . surviving foetus before they prescribed the abortion drugs, which carry . an increased risk of birth defects to any surviving baby. She . said: ‘As happy as I was, I was angry they had missed her on the scans. They said with all the blood and clots it must have created shadows so . they couldn’t see her.’ Katherine . Hales, a spokesman from the Association of Radical Midwives, which . campaigns for improved maternity care in  the NHS, said it was an . ‘extraordinary case’. She said: ‘I have very, very occasionally heard of rare cases of a miscarriage of one baby, and then seeing another on the scan. ‘But I have never heard of this happening. I can’t think of a medical reason for it to happen – it is just luck.’ The Rotunda Hospital was unavailable for comment.

"Andy Coulson will pay a ‘higher price’ for his phone hacking conviction because of his position in David Cameron’s inner circle, a court heard yesterday. The Prime Minister’s former director of communications had become a ‘lightning conductor’ for party political battles and media vendettas since he was found guilty of hacking, his lawyer said. Coulson, 46, the former editor of the News of the World, faces a maximum two-year jail sentence after he was found guilty of presiding over a five-year phone hacking plot at the tabloid. Andy Coulson (left) will pay a 'higher price' for his phone hacking conviction because of his position in David Cameron's inner circle, his lawyer Timothy Langdale (right) said yesterday . But in addition, his barrister Timothy Langdale QC said he had already lost two careers – one in journalism and one in politics – over the scandal and said hacking had become the father-of-three’s ‘nemesis’. Coulson, three former news editors and private detective Glenn Mulcaire will face sentencing on Friday over prosecution claims they corrupted the 168-year-old newspaper and transformed it into a ‘thoroughly criminal enterprise’. Mr Langdale said it was an unfair description of the now defunct newspaper and its journalists, and defended its part in British public life. Coulson, three former news editors and private detective Glenn Mulcaire will face sentencing on Friday over prosecution claims they corrupted the 168-year-old newspaper and transformed it into a 'thoroughly criminal enterprise' The lawyer praised the ‘genuine social and public impact’ of the Sunday tabloid’s investigations and campaigns and told the Old Bailey: ‘Mr Coulson was the editor of the News of the World when a considerable amount of phone hacking took place but there were many undiluted positives in the paper he edited. ‘Whilst it’s not currently fashionable to remember that, it is important that it is not forgotten.’ Coulson was editor of the News of the World from 2003 to 2007 after taking over from Rebekah Brooks, who was last week acquitted of all the charges against her. He went on to become the Conservative Party’s director of communications and moved into Downing Street when Mr Cameron became Prime Minister. Barrister Timothy Langdale QC said he had already lost two careers - one in journalism and one in politics - over the scandal . In mitigation arguments on his behalf, Mr Langdale said: ‘Because of his role after he left the News of the World and because of the wider background to the phone hacking investigation, Mr Coulson has become something of a lightning conductor for the political aspects of the investigation. ‘The political and media furore in the 24 hours following verdicts demonstrated that vividly. Agendas are being pursued and will continue to be pursued way beyond this court’s remit. ‘The court endeavoured to keep party politics and media vendettas out of the trial, but these features mean he will pay a  higher price than most as a result of this conviction.’ Coulson was convicted of phone hacking last week but will also face a retrial after the jury failed to reach verdicts on two further charges that he sanctioned corrupt payments to police. Mr Langdale said Coulson had not known phone hacking was illegal, although he had realised it was an invasion of privacy and a breach of the Press Complaints Commission code of conduct. Journalist Matthew d’Ancona, a political commentator, was called as a witness on his behalf and said Coulson had been ‘utterly reliable’ as the Conservatives’ director of communications and had quickly become part of Mr Cameron’s ‘inner circle’. He had wanted to restore trust in his role which ‘had been tarnished over the years by the culture of spin’, the London Evening Standard and Sunday Telegraph columnist said. Mr Langdale told the Old Bailey Coulson was ‘a thoroughly decent man’ who could still contribute to society and urged the judge not to impose the maximum two-year jail sentence. He will face sentencing on Friday, alongside private detective Glenn Mulcaire, 43, and former news editors Greg Miskiw, 64, Neville Thurlbeck, 52, and James Weatherup, 58. The court heard one of the defendants acquitted by the jury, Mrs Brooks’ former assistant Cheryl Carter, wanted to apply to the court for the legal costs of her defence to be refunded. Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC warned that if similar applications were made by the other acquitted defendants, including Mrs Brooks, it could cost millions in taxpayers’ money. No decision has yet been made.","Former editor of the News of the World faces maximum two-year sentence .

"Rebekah Brooks has been the victim of an unprecedented ‘witch-hunt’, her husband said yesterday, as the couple broke their silence over her dramatic acquittal in the phone-hacking trial. The former News of the World editor said she had been ‘vindicated’ after suffering ‘a maelstrom of controversy, of politics and of comment’.

Speaking out: The former News International chief executive addressed reporters outside her London home . Ordeal: Surrounded by a media scrum outside the house, Mrs Brooks said the last three years had been 'tough' for her, her husband and those close to them . Support: Mr Brooks today paid tribute to the 'dignity' his wife had shown throughout a three-year 'witch-hunt' ‘I am innocent of the crimes that I was charged with and I feel vindicated by the unanimous verdicts,’ she said. ‘The . last few years have been tough for both of us and those closest to us, . but more importantly they have been tough for everybody, on all sides . that have been affected by the issues  raised by this case.’ Asked . if she could have done more to prevent phone hacking at the News of the . World, Mrs Brooks told journalists: ‘It’s been a time of reflection for . me. I’ve learned some valuable lessons and will hopefully become the . wiser for it.’ Response: Mrs Brooks, 46, made no direct reference to Andy Coulson as she faced a barrage of questions from reporters . 'Vindicated': Mrs Brooks said she was innocent of all the crimes she was charged with, and felt 'vindicated' by the jury's unanimous verdicts . Perspective: Mrs Brooks said the trial had made her grateful for her 'happy and healthy' daughter, and the support of her mother . Grateful: Mrs Brooks said she was grateful to the jury following their decision to clear her of all charges . It was . the first time Mrs Brooks and her husband Charlie, 51, had spoken . publicly about the hacking scandal since they were charged in May 2012. Back . then Mrs Brooks condemned her prosecution as ‘nothing more than an . expensive sideshow, a waste of public money as a result of an unjust and . weak decision’, and her husband said she was ‘the subject of a . witch-hunt’. Yesterday Mr . Brooks said he stood by his comments, saying: ‘Everything, absolutely . everything we said, has been proved to be true. ‘Rebekah . has been through an unprecedented investigation of an incredibly . forensic and personal nature, the likes of which we have probably never . seen. ‘And I would just like to say how proud I am of Rebekah and the dignity she has shown.’ Asked if he still believed the prosecution was a witch-hunt, he nodded emphatically and replied: ‘Yes. Unity: The couple both spoke for the first time since the end of the hacking trial, which saw them and three others unanimously cleared of hacking charges. Andy Coulson was found guilty. Mrs Brooks was wearing a £180 'Edie' dress from Boutique by Jaeger, and carrying a £475 'Robinson' by Tory Burch tote-style bag. Tough: Mrs Brooks' voice broke and she appeared to be close to tears as she gave the statement. She would not be drawn on Mr Coulson's fate or whether she should have done more to deal with criminality at the News of the World . Mr . and Mrs Brooks spoke as they left the £5million townhouse in . Clerkenwell, central London, which they had rented for the duration of . the eight-month trial so that they would be close to the Old Bailey. A . tired-looking Mrs Brooks said they were desperate ‘to spend some . much-needed time with Scarlett’, their two-year-old daughter. Scarlett . was born in January 2012, just weeks before the couple were arrested. Their . trial heard how Mrs Brooks had been unable to conceive, despite . fertility treatment, and Scarlett was born after a cousin agreed to a . surrogate pregnancy. She . ignored questions about how she felt about the conviction of her former . deputy editor and lover Andy Coulson, the only person found guilty at . the trial. Coulson, 46, who . later became Prime Minister David Cameron’s director of communications . in Downing Street, faces prison when he is sentenced next week alongside . three former News of the World news editors and private detective Glenn . Mulcaire. Mr Brooks said he was ‘very sad’ for Coulson, his wife and their three young sons. He said they had not heard from Mr Cameron – with whom they were close friends before the trial – since Tuesday’s acquittal. Time of reflection: Mrs Brooks told the waiting reporters that she had 'learned some valuable lessons', and hopefully was 'the wiser for it' Mixed emotions: At times Mrs Brooks smiled and at others she was close to tears, and said she would spend her time supporting her colleagues still on trial but would not be drawn on her own career going forward . Tribute: Mr Brooks, said he was already back working full time as a horse trainer, said his wife went 'through an unprecedented investigation of an incredibly forensic and personal nature, the likes of which we have probably never seen' Back home: The couple said they were heading back to Oxfordshire to spend more time with their daughter .

"Clash: Mr Justice Saunders demanded an explanation for the PM's strong statement . David Cameron was embroiled in an extraordinary clash with an Old Bailey judge yesterday as he was accused of almost wrecking the final stages of the £100million phone-hacking trial. Mr Justice Saunders reacted furiously to the Prime Minister’s decision to brand Andy Coulson a liar as the jury was still deliberating over two charges against the former Downing Street spin doctor. The judge also hit out at other politicians – including Labour leader Ed Miliband, Chancellor George Osborne, London mayor Boris Johnson and John Whittingdale, chairman of the Commons media committee – who ‘made strong comments’ about Coulson. He wrote to Mr Cameron demanding an explanation for his comments, which were attacked in court as ‘ill-advised and premature’ and said to be unprecedented from a prime minister during a high-profile criminal trial. The judge contrasted the politicians’ indecent haste to comment on the case with the restraint shown by journalists. He said: ‘The Press in court have been extremely responsible in their reporting of this case but when politicians regard it as open season one cannot expect the Press to remain silent.’ A Government source accused the judge . of being at fault, having not applied reporting restrictions until the . case was concluded. ‘He opened the stable door and expected the horse . not to bolt. It is a ridiculous state of affairs,’ the source said. Coulson . was found guilty on Tuesday of conspiracy to hack phones and is . expected to be sentenced next week. Carpeted: David Cameron was accused by Coulson's QC of using the verdict to score political points . The jury was discharged yesterday . after failing to agree verdicts on charges that he and former News of . the World royal editor Clive Goodman made corrupt payments to police. Prosecutors will decide on Monday whether they will face a retrial on . these charges. On the dramatic final day of a trial which dragged on for eight months: . Mr . Cameron hired Coulson weeks after he resigned from the News of the . World following the 2007 jailing of Goodman for a phone-hacking offence. In the Commons, the Prime Minister insisted the Leveson Inquiry into . Press standards had examined his failure to heed warnings about the . risks of taking Coulson into No 10 and Coulson’s vetting process . ‘exhaustively’ and found him not to be at fault. The . Old Bailey heard that the judge had contacted Downing Street to demand . an explanation for Mr Cameron’s televised statement on Tuesday, after . the first verdicts, in which he said Coulson had given him ‘false . assurances’. Mr Justice . Saunders said: ‘The jury were not aware of that before and it is a . matter which is capable of affecting Mr Coulson’s credibility in their . eyes.’ Clearly exasperated, . he told the court he would have expected Mr Cameron and other . politicians to wait for the jury to complete their decisions before . making comments, adding: ‘I don’t know whether it was just done in . ignorance or whether it was done deliberately.’ In the Commons, the Prime Minister insisted the Leveson Inquiry had examined his failure to heed warnings about the risks of taking Andy Coulson (pictured with his lawyer Timothy Langdale) into No 10 . It . was the second time the Prime Minister has been criticised for . jeopardising a high-profile trial. Late last year he was rebuked for . comments about a trial involving TV chef Nigella Lawson. Downing Street insisted Mr Cameron had taken legal advice from Attorney General Dominic Grieve about what could be said. Mr . Miliband said Mr Cameron would go down in history as ‘the first-ever . occupant of his office who brought a criminal into the heart of Downing . Street’. 'I don't know whether it was just done in ignorance or whether it was done deliberately' Mr Justice Saunders . The News of the World’s former managing editor, Stuart Kuttner, . who was also cleared during the trial, said he and his former . colleagues were the victims of a state-sponsored stitch-up. The . 74-year-old told Channel 4 News he and others were ‘rounded up’ because . police and prosecutors wanted to ‘take on the Press’. ‘What lies behind it was, in my view, an absolute unmerited assault on a free Press,’ he added. Three . former news editors at the paper and private investigator Glenn . Mulcaire have admitted hacking and will be sentenced next week with . Coulson. In an apparent . justification of the huge costs of the case, Greg McGill, a senior . lawyer for the Crown Prosecution Service, said: ‘This case was not about . whether phone hacking took place or whether public officials were paid . for information – there are a significant number of recent convictions . which show that both did happen. ‘This . has been a lengthy and complex trial which was required to explore a . culture of invading privacy. The judge agreed that the evidence was . sufficient for consideration by the jury.’","Mr Justice Saunders hit out at PM, Miliband, Osborne and Boris Johnson .

"Rebekah Brooks has received payouts totalling more than £16million since she resigned from News International, it can be revealed. The former News of the World editor walked away with £10.8million at the height of the phone hacking scandal in 2011 and received another £5.3million in the last financial year. The payouts from Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation empire were for ‘compensation for loss of office’ but are understood to include the former chief executive’s legal fees to defend herself against the hacking charges during the eight-month trial. And the acquittal of Mrs Brooks and her husband Charlie on all charges saw the celebrations start, with Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson among friends visiting the couple’s London home on Tuesday night. Scroll down for video . Let the party begin: Jeremy Clarkson was seen leaving the Brooks's London home with a dark-haired woman after Rebekah Brooks and her husband Charlie were cleared of all charges in the phone-hacking trial . Friends: The Top Gear presenter is part of the Chipping Norton set and was in the Old Bailey during the trial . The verdicts mean the 46-year-old would be entitled legally to ask the court to repay some of the costs of her defence from the public purse, although no application has yet been made. News Corp has refused to reveal how much it has paid out in legal fees for the hacking trial – but it funded huge legal teams for six of the seven defendants, including Mr and Mrs Brooks and Andy Coulson. The Top Gear presenter has stood by Mrs Brooks during the phone-hacking trial since last year . Figures reported to the US Securities and Exchange Commission in May revealed the investigation into the hacking scandal had cost the firm $535million (£315million). That includes pay-outs to 718 hacking victims to settle civil claims, and legal fees for the civil and criminal cases. The company’s overall costs were previously reported to have reached £600million once redundancy pay-outs and lost revenues from the closure of the News of the World were included, and there has been speculation the scandal could end up costing it more than £1billion once all the trials are completed. Mrs Brooks’ legal team was led by Jonathan Laidlaw QC and legal insiders suggested he was unlikely to have accepted the case for less than £6,000 per day, with a hefty ‘upfront’ fee. The Crown Prosecution Service has revealed it spent £1.75million bringing the case to trial. Before her arrest on the hacking charges, Mrs Brooks was one of the most influential women in Britain and mingled with the political elite. Her first marriage to EastEnders actor Ross Kemp gave her an entree to the showbusiness world and she became the confidante of politicians and celebrities alike. With her Old Etonian second husband, racehorse trainer Mr Brooks, she attended Royal Ascot, dined at the best restaurants and became a key part of the Chipping Norton set of media stars and politicians who live near the Brookses’ Cotswolds home. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown’s wife Sarah invited her to a sleepover at Chequers and she was a regular at David and Samantha Cameron’s ‘kitchen suppers’ in Oxfordshire. That world of well-connected socialising appeared under threat after her arrest and trial. But friends stood by her. Not guilty: Rebekah Brooks and her husband Charlie walked free hand in hand from the Old Bailey on Tuesday . Clarkson tweeted he was 'beyond ecstatic' when the couple were found not guilty . Clarkson watched from the public gallery at the Old Bailey as Mr Brooks gave evidence during the trial and later tweeted he was ‘beyond ecstatic’ when the couple were found not guilty. The presenter, another member of the Chipping Norton set, was swift to join in the celebrations. He and a mystery woman friend were pictured among a number of friends who visited the couple’s London home on Tuesday night. However, Clarkson seemed a little coy about being seen in public with his companion. As they left the party, she went to link arms with him – only for the 54-year-old to shrug her away with a look of mild annoyance as TV cameras captured the incident. Mrs Brooks acquittal may not automatically lead to her re-entry into the highest political circles. But judging by Mr Clarkson’s rapid appearance at the Brookses’ home, she has already been welcomed back to the fold by some of her influential friends.","Former News of the World editor received £10.8m at height of scandal .

"Costs: The hacking trial, which yesterday cleared Rebekah Brooks, pictured, of all charges, has cost as much as £95million . The seven-month phone hacking trial is believed to have cost £95million, making it the most expensive criminal case in Britain. The police investigation and prosecution cost the British public more than £35million but unusually the brunt of the cost of the defence has not been met by the taxpayer. Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp empire funded huge legal teams for six of the seven defendants, including Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson. It has refused to reveal the legal fees for the trial but figures reported to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in May revealed the investigation into the hacking scandal had cost the firm $535million (£315million). That figure includes pay-outs to 718 hacking victims to settle civil claims, and legal fees for the civil and criminal cases. The firm’s costs were previously reported to have reached £600million once redundancy pay-outs and lost revenues from the closure of the News of the World (NOTW) were included and there has been speculation the scandal could end up costing it £1billion once all the trials are completed. In December 2013 News Group Newspapers, the publishers of the Sun and the Sun on Sunday, reported £87.5million in costs in its annual report for ‘non-operational, one-off charges relating to allegations of voicemail interception and inappropriate payments to public officials and other related matters’. Within that £50million was spent on legal fees, £10.2million on claimants’ legal fees and £26million on ‘legal and professional fees’ related to the Management and Standards Committee set up in the wake of the hacking scandal. Brooks’ defence costs alone are likely to have topped £10million. Her acquittal means her legal team could be entitled to ask the Crown Prosecution Service to repay some of the costs of her defence, which would significantly increase the trial’s cost to the public purse. Her team was originally led by John Kelsey-Fry QC, one of Britain’s best-known criminal lawyers who can command up to £20,000 per day. He was forced to leave the case before . the trial got underway last October and Jonathan Laidlaw QC was brought . in to replace him at the last minute. Scroll down for video . Bearing the brunt: Costs of six hacking defendants, including former News of the World Editor and Number 10 spin doctor Andy Coulson, left, were shouldered by the News Corp empire of Rupert Murdoch, right . Legal insiders have suggested Mr Laidlaw was unlikely to have accepted the case for less than £6,000 per day, with a hefty ‘upfront’ fee. Mr Laidlaw had two junior barristers and the trio were instructed by legal firm Kingsley Napley, which was understood to have had five solicitors, four paralegals and partner Angus McBride working full-time on Brooks’ case since January 2013. Coulson’s barrister Timothy Langdale QC was reputed to have agreed a £750 hourly fee, also paid by News Group. Trial judge Mr Justice Saunders frequently alluded to the ‘astronomic’ costs of the case and remarked in March: ‘We have probably the most expensive case in the country here.’ The Operation Crevice fertiliser bomb plot trial was previously thought to be the most expensive criminal case in British history. The year-long trial, which ended in March 2006, involved 18 defendants and cost £50million.

"author] . Hacked: Milly Dowler's messages were accessed by the News of the World, but not deleted, the trial heard . Journalists at the News of the World did not delete schoolgirl Milly Dowler’s voicemails and give her parents ‘false hope’ she was alive, the phone hacking trial judge said yesterday. Mr Justice Saunders told the jury that a private detective working for the now defunct tabloid had accessed the 13-year-old’s mobile phone and hacked her messages after she went missing in 2002, but had not deliberately deleted the voicemails. The Guardian newspaper previously claimed in 2011 that messages were deliberately deleted and this had given Milly’s parents false hope that their daughter was alive. Mr Justice Saunders told the Old Bailey jury the messages would have been automatically saved once they had been listened to, and then deleted from the answerphone system eventually. But by then the News of the World had already contacted Surrey Police and told officers it had taped recordings of the messages. Summing up the evidence in the seven-month trial he said: ‘Once hacked into, it becomes a saved message to be deleted automatically. ‘It…couldn’t have led to any false hope because the News of the World went to the police.’ He repeated trial evidence, saying: ‘They, the Guardian, were wrong and they have accepted it.’ The News of the World’s then editor Rebekah Brooks, 46, and her then deputy Andy Coulson, 46, deny they were part of a six-year conspiracy to hack phones at the newspaper. All seven defendants in the trial deny all the accusations against them. The trial continues. Accused: Rebekah Brooks, left and Andy Coulson, right, deny all accusations against them .

"It's the home of high unemployment figures, buildings flattened during World War II and the melancholy poetry of Philip Larkin. And now Hull - once cruelly nicknamed Hell - is set to have its very own cruise ship terminal. Since being named the UK City of Culture 2017, gaining the unanimous backing of the judging panel and seeing off competition from Dundee, Leicester and Swansea Bay, there's an undeniable buzz. And City Council leaders are 'intent' on bringing a £17m cruise ship terminal to the Humber estuary, council leader Steve Brady has said. Named the UK City of Culture 2017, Hull Council leader are sure a cruise ship terminal will boost their economy . The authority has agreed to spend £380,000 on initial studies for the project, which is set to be up and running by 2017. It would be used as a half-day stop-off point and sited near iconic landmark,The Deep aquarium. Councillor Brady believes the move would give Hull's economy a major boost. He said: 'It's not a time to be faint-hearted – this is a time to invest in the city for the future. 'It's going to be a high-quality terminal. We want it to last the city for generations,' he told the Hull Daily Mail. In winning the City of Culture, the east Yorkshire city was praised for showing 'real understanding' of what the title was about in a bid built around the theme 'a city coming out of the shadows'.

The study announced this week is just the first step. But Councillor Brady said he is convinced the project will go ahead and feels sure it would boost footfall. Cllr Brady said: 'It's a lot of technical work at the moment. It's not going to be something that will be forgotten about.

"Under scrutiny: Rebekah Brooks has faced a 'witch hunt' resembling a medieval show trial, her lawyer told the phone hacking trial yesterday . Rebekah Brooks has faced a ‘witch hunt’ resembling a medieval show trial, her lawyer told the phone hacking trial yesterday. The former News International chief executive has been subjected to public revulsion over accusations she presided over a six-year conspiracy to hack phones, including hacking the voicemails of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler, the Old Bailey was told. During her seven-month trial the 45-year-old’s actions have been examined and scrutinised ‘in a way which may well be unprecedented in the history of British justice,’ her lawyer Jonathan Laidlaw QC said. Mr Laidlaw said she had been given a fair trial but said the prosecution’s attitude towards her had ‘at times been that of a witch hunt’. In his final remarks to the jury, the lawyer likened her treatment at the hands of prosecutor Andrew Edis QC to a ‘medieval show trial’ where a woman accused of witchcraft would be tied to a ducking stool, and acquitted if she drowned but burned at the stake as a witch if she survived. He said: ‘Just as in a medieval show trial you could tell a true witch when she floated, so Mr Edis will interpret every piece of evidence about Mrs Brooks - everything she says and everything anyone else says about her - as a sign of guilt, regardless of its true meaning. ‘If Mrs Brooks writes an email to a member of her staff instructing that person to act lawfully, to make sure everything they do is 110 percent justified, right and proper, it only goes to show she knew they were up to no good in the first place. ‘If she comes across as a nice person in the witness box, it’s only a cunning mask. If she makes you laugh, it’s only because she’s telling you lies. ‘If her evidence makes sense it’s only because it is carefully scripted.’ Arriving at court: The former News International chief executive (left) has been subjected to public revulsion over accusations she presided over a six-year conspiracy to hack phones, Jonathan Laidlaw QC (right) said . Such lies in her evidence would be ‘cynical perjury’, Mr Laidlaw said, and urged the jury to ignore public revulsion over the News of the World’s hacking of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler. He told the eight women and three men: ‘There are those who love her [Brooks] deeply but she’s become, since Milly Dowler, a controversial figure and many people hate her.’ Brooks, a married mother-of-one, denies she knew about phone hacking at the now defunct Sunday tabloid, including the targeting of the murdered schoolgirl’s voicemail messages in 2002. Mr Laidlaw said the prosecution had itself called a witness who had deliberately lied to the jury. Tragic: Brooks allegedly presided over the hacking of the voicemails of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler . He said Eimear Cook, the ex-wife of golfer Colin Montgomerie, had told a ‘bare-faced lie’ when she gave evidence that Brooks had joked about her own arrest for an alleged assault on her former husband, EastEnders actor Ross Kemp, and had admitted a story in the News of the World had come from hacking. In fact Brooks was not arrested over the alleged assault until three months after the episode Mrs Cook described so the conversation could not have happened. Mr Laidlaw said: ‘There’s simply no possibility Mrs Cook has got it wrong by mistake. She was lying.’ Prosecutors and police were so eager to include her evidence as a ‘coup’ in their case against Brooks that they failed to carry out basic checks which would have proved it was false, he told the court. ‘Perhaps they took Mrs Cook entirely at face value. She’s an affluent ex-wife of a famous golfer, well-spoken, apparently credible, why test her account? Perhaps they didn’t want to. ‘She was certainly an important witness in the prosecution case but she was a liar,’ Mr Laidlaw said. He suggested Mrs Cook could have been motivated by a personal vendetta or grudge against Brooks or could have hoped to win more compensation from News International in her civil case as a victim of phone hacking. Brooks denies plotting to hack phones and commit misconduct by making allegedly corrupt payments to a public official for information while she was editor at The Sun. The information led to stories which had exposed wrongdoing in the Army which the Ministry of Defence had attempted to cover up, Mr Laidlaw said, including a recruit seriously injured in an attack by his drill sergeant. Court: In his final remarks to the Old Bailey (pictured), Mr Laidlaw likened Brooks's treatment at the hands of prosecutor Andrew Edis QC to a 'medieval show trial' where a woman accused of witchcraft would go 'on trial' The lawyer said Brooks had been painted as ‘the arch criminal’ who had sanctioned hacking and misconduct and then involved her husband Charlie Brooks, her PA and News International’s head of security in another plot to hide evidence from police. He said she had faced ‘profound anger’ over the closure of the News of the World in 2011, but added: ‘Not one former colleague, not one disgruntled reporter has come forward to say she had anything to do with phone hacking.’ Brooks denies conspiring to hack phones, commit misconduct and pervert the course of justice. All the defendants in the case, including her former lover Andy Coulson, who later became David Cameron’s director of communications in Downing Street, deny all the accusations against them.

"The Guardian claimed that the Sunday tabloid was to blame for giving Milly Dowler's parents false hope that their missing daughter was alive . The launch of the Leveson Inquiry and the closure of the News of the World stemmed from one incendiary allegation which shocked the nation – and turned out to be untrue. The Guardian claimed that the Sunday tabloid was to blame for giving Milly Dowler’s parents false hope that their missing daughter was alive. In a front page story, the newspaper accused the News of the World of hacking into the schoolgirl’s messages and deliberately erasing them in the cynical hope that clearing space for newer messages would give them fresh information for stories about the 13-year-old’s disappearance. This, it was said, led her parents to believe she had cleared her voicemail herself and so must be alive. The claim in July 2011 catapulted the phone hacking row into a national scandal, and so great was the outrage that the 168-year-old News of the World was closed four days later with the loss of hundreds of jobs. The allegation was also a crucial factor in David Cameron’s decision to order the Leveson Inquiry. But five months later, the Guardian’s story was shown to be untrue. While the News of the World did listen to the schoolgirl’s voicemail, police said there was no evidence that it deleted any messages. Instead, investigators now believe the messages were erased automatically by the mobile phone provider. The Guardian eventually issued a rather cursory 157-word correction on page 32 of the newspaper, in which it conceded: ‘The [News of the World] is unlikely to have been responsible for the deletion of a set of voicemails from the phone that caused her parents to have false hopes that she was alive.’ Phone hacking trial judge Mr Justice Saunders said the tabloid was not responsible for giving Mr and Mrs Dowler false hope, adding: ‘They, the Guardian, were wrong and they have accepted it.’ The newspaper accused the News of the World of hacking into the schoolgirl's messages and deliberately erasing to clear space for newer messages. This, it was said, led her parents (pictured) to believe she had cleared her voicemail herself and so must be alive . Anti-corruption police investigated how the Guardian got the information for their story and arrested an officer, DC Peter Cripps, on suspicion of conspiracy to commit misconduct. Journalist Amelia Hill, one of the authors of the Guardian front page story, was interviewed under caution. Police suspected DC Cripps – the ‘interview strategy designer’ for Operation Weeting – had leaked information and found a mass of telephone contact between him and Miss Hill, but no evidence of payments being given. Milly's body was found six months after her disappearance. Bouncer Levi Bellfield is serving a life sentence for her murder . Det Supt Mark Mitchell, from Scotland Yard’s anti-corruption command, said: ‘DC Cripps was informing Amelia Hill around when arrests were to take place, who they were. We could find no evidence of financial inducement, which was the main reason why the CPS decided not to press charges.’ The decision not to charge DC Cripps, 53, and Miss Hill, 39, was attacked as ‘double standards’ by a defence lawyer for Clive Goodman, who is accused of paying police for information. David Spens QC appeared to suggest the officer had passed information to the journalist because they were in a relationship. He told the jury: ‘Let’s assume no money changed hands because they were in a relationship … Is it all right if it’s done within a relationship but not if it’s for money? Mr Spens was reminded by the judge that there was no evidence in the trial of a relationship between Miss Hill and DC Cripps, who has since retired from the police. Miss Hill said the decision to investigate her was ‘completely disproportionate … and a sinister attempt to chill public interest journalism’ and defended the work of the Guardian in exposing phone hacking. Milly went missing as she walked home from school in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, in March 2002. Her voicemail inbox quickly filled up so that no more messages could be left. Days later, when her mother Sally was suddenly able to get through again, she told the Leveson Inquiry she shouted out in elation: ‘She’s picked up her voicemail – she’s alive.’ Milly’s body was found six months after her disappearance. Bouncer Levi Bellfield is serving a life sentence for her murder.","The paper claimed that the Sunday tabloid was to blame for giving Milly Dowler’s parents false hope that their missing daughter was alive .

"A boy aged three died after a catalogue of failures by the NHS and in particular its out-of-hours services, a damning report is expected to reveal this week. Sam Morrish died 36 hours after his parents first sought medical help for suspected flu and a chest infection. In that crucial period, they say they experienced a series of shocking blunders from doctors, NHS Direct, an out-of-hours GP service and a hospital. Sam Morrish died following a catalogue of errors by his local NHS providers in Devon in December 2010 . The . mistakes were compounded when the grieving couple asked the NHS to . investigate the events leading to Sam’s death from septic shock to . prevent future tragedies. Two . initial investigations failed to identify key problems, and Scott and . Susanna Morrish said they were forced to relive ‘the life-shattering . death’ of their child to get officials to finally act. Mr . Morrish, 41, said: ‘Sam was full of life. He was a force of nature, . with an infectious sense of fun… If nobody listens and if the system is . not changed then children like Sam will keep dying.’ Sam . fell ill with suspected flu on December 21, 2010, and his mother took . him to his local GP who said there was no sign of a chest infection. The . toddler’s condition deteriorated overnight and his mother called the . surgery the next morning to say he was worse and ‘constantly thirsty’. She . was asked if he had been passing urine and said he was too ill to get . up and use the lavatory so she had kept him in a nappy. But the GP . failed to ask if there was urine in the nappy. It was dry, a signal that . Sam’s kidneys had begun to fail. Sam was finally taken to Torbay Hospital, which is run by South Devon Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, where he died in December 2010 . That . evening after he vomited clear liquid containing thin strands which . appeared to be blood his parents called NHS Direct, but their call was . categorised as routine, not an emergency, and information was recorded . wrongly. Sam then vomited a . black liquid and Mrs Morrish, 38, contacted an out-of-hours GP service, . Devon Doctors, who told her to take Sam to a local treatment centre in . Newton Abbot. A young mother died from cancer after doctors told her to cure a lump on her breast with primrose oil ointment. Samina Chaudhry, from Northampton, went back several times to say the treatment was not working. Two years later, doctors sent a biopsy for analysis and advanced cancer was diagnosed. Scans found multiple tumours on her brain. Her devastated husband Mohammed is now bringing up their sons Zeeshan, 13, and Usman, 11, on his own. Mrs Chaudhry first visited her GP in 2006 when she was 27 and was referred to Northampton General Hospital where doctors diagnosed a skin condition similar to eczema and advised her to treat it with primrose oil ointment. It wasn’t until November 2008 that a biopsy was sent to be examined. She died in 2012, aged 33. Northampton General Hospital has now agreed to pay the family damages. Mrs Morrish . questioned the advice but was wrongly assured the treatment centre was . her best option. The family learned later the advice was based on a . conversation between the unqualified call handler and a driver. At . the treatment centre, the family were placed in a queue until Mrs . Morrish flagged down a passing nurse who immediately raised the alarm. The . little boy was taken by ambulance to Torbay Hospital and prescribed . antibiotics, but did not receive the drugs for three hours. By that time . an invasive bacterial infection had entered his weakened system and he . died from septic shock hours later on December 23. The . case highlighted concerns about the safety of out-of-hours care, . including NHS Direct, which has since been replaced. But the family said . their distress had been compounded by bureaucracy and failings in the . complaints procedure. According . to the Patients Association, which has supported Mr and Mrs Morrish, . two investigations commissioned by Devon NHS ‘failed to find answers and . hold those involved to account’. In . March 2012 the couple complained to the Parliamentary and Health . Service Ombudsman (PHSO), the highest authority on NHS complaints. But . they said officials failed to understand information about the case. The . couple said they persevered in a bid to improve the health service for . other patients, including their other sons, now aged nine and two. The Patients Association said Sam’s death exposed ‘catastrophic and systemic’ failings in care and in how the NHS handles complaints. Chief executive Katherine Murphy said: 'Having worked with the Morrish family over the last three years, our experience of the PHSO has been painful. 'The family wanted organisations to learn so that this would not happen again, but the ombudsman did not want to interview anyone about what went wrong. 'The PHSO is the body which is supposed to hold the NHS to account and set benchmarks but there seems to be a lack of accountability for its own actions. 'The Patients Association helpline has advised hundreds of people to contact the ombudsman but time and time again people have come back to us saying the PHSO has told them there’s nothing more they can do. 'At this point in time I would not advise anyone who came to our helpline to contact the PHSO, because I have no confidence in it. A senior executive within the PHSO told Mr Morrish and I the methodology used in their investigation into our complaints was not fit for purpose. 'It’s time that this organisation was subjected to greater scrutiny. It costs billions at a time when the NHS is struggling. If that money was invested in frontline staff we would have a very different NHS.' The . PHSO is due to publish its report into Sam’s death this week and is . expected to uphold Mr and Mrs Morrish’s concerns about his treatment. A . PHSO spokesman said: ‘We recognise that we took too long to investigate . this case.’ Devon Doctors said it was committed to ensuring such an . occurrence cannot happen again.","Sam Morrish died at Torbay Hospital in South Devon in December 2010 .

"Rebekah Brooks's lawyer told the court that prosecutors have failed to stand up a case against her after seven months of evidence . Rebekah Brooks has faced ‘downright cruelty and vitriol’ during a sustained campaign to convict her of phone hacking ‘no matter what’, the Old Bailey heard yesterday. The prosecution has failed to find a ‘smoking gun’ that proves her guilt, despite a massive police investigation with ‘untold resources dedicated to it’, her lawyer said. Jonathan Laidlaw QC, for Brooks, said the prosecution had relied on ‘outrageous’ tactics in its desperate pursuit of a conviction, including presenting lies and misleading evidence to the jury. In his closing speech to the jury, the lawyer launched a broadside against the publicity surrounding the former News International chief executive’s prosecution. He said: ‘The case has been conducted against the backdrop of significant attention from the media, and attention from the media in all its modern forms. ‘Opinions have been expressed with views running from criticism and comment through inaccuracy and bias to downright cruelty and vitriol.’ During seven months of evidence, Mr Laidlaw said prosecutors had failed to prove their case against the 45-year-old, despite ‘twisting and turning’ the evidence. At least one witness had lied in their evidence, he said, and police had misled jurors ‘to protect what is the ultimate prosecution theory in this case: Rebekah Brooks must be guilty, no matter what’. Mr Laidlaw said the so-called ‘Trial of the Century’ had failed to show Brooks was the architect of the phone hacking scandal when she edited the News of the World, from 2000 to 2003. Only one story had been proven to come from hacking during her editorship, about murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler, and that was published while she was on holiday and her deputy Andy Coulson was in charge. Brooks had campaigned over the protection of children after the murder of eight-year-old Sarah Payne and would have been horrified by the hacking of the missing girl, Mr Laidlaw said. The prosecution alleged Coulson, who later became David Cameron’s director of communications in Downing Street, was more likely to have told Brooks about the hack because the pair were involved in a six-year affair. Brooks, who arrived at the Old Bailey today with friends and family including Charlie Brooks (right), has been the subject of significant media attention, Jonathan Laidlaw QC told the court in his closing speech today . But Mr Laidlaw said a 2004 love letter in which Brooks spoke of waiting for Coulson for six years did not prove their clandestine relationship lasted for that time, and said there was no telephone contact between them during Brooks’ holiday until after the Dowler messages were hacked. He accused the prosecution of being ‘desperate’ to link the notorious hacking episode to Brooks and said once she moved to the Sun she and Coulson were rival editors, adding: ‘Lovers they may have been, but no love was lost between their papers.’ The News of the World’s £92,000-a-year private detective Glenn Mulcaire was given 550 ‘taskings’ during her editorship but was only proved to have been asked to hack 12 times. Four news desk editors have admitted their part in a phone hacking conspiracy with Mulcaire and Mr Laidlaw said the prosecution case was that Brooks must have known and sanctioned the plot. But the hacking only became ‘prolific’ after she left and Mulcaire’s contract with the newspaper only stipulated ‘research and information’ services, Mr Laidlaw said. She left the News of the World in 2003 to become editor of The Sun and her lawyer questioned why there had been no evidence of hacking at The Sun if it was a practice its new editor knew of and approved. The former News Of The World editor (left) has been standing trial alongside Andy Coulson (right) Mr Laidlaw said prosecutor Andrew Edis QC had pursued an attitude of ‘theory first, evidence later’ to convict Brooks at any cost said the jury might have expected to hear more direct evidence, rather than theories. He said: ‘You must have been expecting him to have laid out for you a whole mass of evidence, a welter of material the police had discovered as a result of a massive inquiry with untold resources directed to it. ‘You must have been expecting a mass of material to demonstrate that Mrs Brooks was the architect of phone hacking at the News of the World. That was not the case.’ Opinions have been expressed with views . running from criticism and comment through inaccuracy and bias to . downright cruelty and vitriol . - Jonathan Laidlaw QC . Mr Laidlaw said the prosecution had called a witness, Eimear Cook, the ex-wife of golfer Colin Montgomerie, who had been caught out lying in her evidence. The jury has heard she claimed Brooks told her about an episode when she was arrested for an alleged assault on her ex-husband, EastEnders actor Ross Kemp, when the arrest actually happened months after Mrs Cook met Brooks. The trial has now entered its final phase, with lawyers for each of the seven defendants giving speeches on their behalf and the jury is expected to be sent out to consider verdicts next month (June). Brooks and Coulson, 46, both deny conspiring to hack phones and conspiring with others to commit misconduct by making illegal payments to public officials. Brooks also denies conspiring to pervert the course of justice. All seven defendants deny all the charges against them. The trial continues.

"A grandfather who was shot in the head with a suspected rubber bullet said he could have died or been blinded. John Vernon Thomas was on his first trip abroad to see Everton play in Lille in France when he was shot. Police are now trying to determine whether a 'flash-ball' or rubber bullet was fired. The bullets are designed to be less lethal than those used in normal guns and were used by officers that day to try and control the trouble which flared between fans. The 66-year-old, known as Vernon, said he heard a 'crack' and was hit in the head when he accidentally got caught up in the disturbance in the main square. Scroll down for video . John Vernon Thomas was hit in the head by a suspected rubber bullet during the clashes in Lille, France . Police with shields dispersed Everton fans from Lille square using tear gas canisters as flares were released . He said: 'It hit me right on the temple. I went down in a bit of a shock. Another two inches it would have gone to my eyes. I am lucky to be here. It was a nasty attack. It took the wind out of me.' Mr Thomas was taken to hospital and kept in overnight after being told his injuries were life threatening. He added: 'There was blood pouring out. I don't know if it was a rubber bullet or what. It was like being punched by Mike Tyson. People have said that I was in the wrong place at the wrong time.' Mr Thomas, a season ticket holder, was forced to miss the match the next day. Mr Thomas said had the suspected rubber bullet hit him nearer to his eye he could have been killed or blinded . Police with shields dispersed Everton fans from Lille square using tear gas canisters as flares were released . Clashes broke out in the main square in Lille last Thursday ahead of the game and led to Everton fans being dispersed with tear gas. Flares were set off and riot police moved through a group of fans, with shields covering their bodies, and released tear gas bombs. Rubber bullets are also thought to have been used. Fans were left rubbing their eyes and sneezing, and they attempted to flee the scene as bottles flew across the square. Around 7,000 fans had travelled  from the UK to Lillle for the match. Mr Thomas, a grandfather, had to spend a night in hospital after he was hit in the temple by the bullet . Police have insisted the 44m rubber bullets, as well as tear gas canisters, had been used by riot police in 'self-defence' after bottles were thrown at them. The incident was apparently triggered after plain-clothes police tried to arrest a suspected football hooligan. The man had been previously spotted by a Merseyside Police officer travelling with Blues (Everton) fans. He was later released by French police and allowed to return home without charge. At the same time a French football hooligan who was among thugs who stormed a bar where Everton fans were drinking was jailed. Blues fans came under attack from up to 100 people the night before the match took place. The incident came the day after several Everton fans were injured after an ambush by a group of 50 people, wearing masks and wielding metal chairs outside a pub on Wednesday evening. Two fans suffered minor injuries. A suspected Lille 'ultra' - known only as Tomasz S - was arrested on Thursday after being recognised by police. The 30-year-old appeared in court on Friday and was jailed for eight months.","John Vernon Thomas was on first trip abroad to see Everton play in Lille .

"Two weeks after an air show appearance was canceled due to engine problem, one of the last two remaining airworthy Canadian World War Two Lancaster bombers is up and running and set to make further appearances, starting from today. The Lancaster, currently on a UK tour, suffered mechanical issues ahead of the Bournemouth Air Festival in August and engineers had to replace an engine, incurring huge costs and cancellations of appearances  around the country. But now, Action Stations, the company who arrange for flight fans to fly along side the Lancaster -  and with the Canadian Warplane Museum - will run extra flights, allowing aviation enthusiasts the chance to see her fly from the sky once more. A Canadian Lancaster bomber, one of only two remaining planes, performs in the The Battle of Britain Memorial Flight Lancaster flypast over Windermere in Cumbria. The first of these flights will take place today from Bournemouth Airport – and more flights will be announced in the coming days due to demand. The repaired Lancaster bomber arrived at Bournemouth Airport yesterday, along with the last remaining airworthy RAF Lancaster. The two planes will be stationed in Bournemouth while they take part in scheduled appearances at the Duxford Air Show in Cambridgeshire and the Goodwood Revival event in West Sussex. After successful flights with the Lancaster at Humberside, the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum (CWHM) the owners and operators of Vera, agreed to organise further flights today and potentially other dates according to demand. The two planes will be stationed in Bournemouth while they take part in scheduled appearances at the Duxford Air Show in Cambridgeshire and the Goodwood Revival event in West Sussex . 'A spectacular avaiation experience': The glorious Canadian Lancaster Bomber in flight . Attendees to the Goodwood Revival this coming weekend, will get the chance to see the Lancaster fly out of Bournemouth airport - and even fly alongside her. These flights, which take place in an Action Stations aircraft not only give enthusiasts the chance of a lifetime to photograph the Lancaster in flight – they give a real financial boost contributing towards running costs. Flights alongside the Canadian bomber cost £2,150 and include a 40-minute flight - flying alongside the Lancaster for about 30 minutes - as well as a tour of the plane and a photo opportunity. People take photos of the Lancaster bomber, one of only two in the world still flying, at Durham Tees Valley Airport in Darlington, as it tours the country . Stephen Burt, CEO of Action Stations, said: 'We offer these flights to ensure the memory of those aircrews who gave of themselves in our hour of need, is never forgotten. 'Flying with the Lancaster was the most spectacular aviation experience that I have ever undertaken - to sail through the sky with this giant of an aeroplane was truly inspiring and make's one appreciate the skill , bravery of the aircrews who flew her, mainly at night, often under fire from both enemy aircraft and the ground.

'Like the Spitfire she is a legend in her time, and this 'one off' opportunity to fly with her shouldn't be missed! In August, MailOnline Travel was given exclusive access to film the Avro Lancaster Mk X, which this month made the 14-hour, 3,700-mile journey to Britain for the last time. The four-minute tribute video shows the bomber taking off from Humberside Airport, flying down to Lincoln Cathedral, then out towards the North Sea and over The Lincolnshire Aviation Heritage Museum - home of the Avro Lancaster Just Jane. The Canadian Lancaster, with a magnificent 102ft wingspan, looks haunting and glorious, its distinctive markings shimmering in the sunlight, as the plane - one of the Second World War's most-recognisable British aircraft - powers across the blue sky. More than 7,377 Lancasters, 430 of which were built in Canada, were built during the Second World War but many that survived were scrapped. It was the most successful bomber used by the Royal Air Force and the Royal Canadian Air Force.","Two weeks after an air show appearance was canceled due to engine problem, one of the last remaining Lancaster bombers will fly again .

Chelsy, who dated Harry from 2005 to 2010, is the best friend of Lady Melissa – Missy to her friends. Missy is the youngest daughter of the .

"Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius was in direct contact with President Barack Obama at least 18 times between October 2012 and October 2013, including seven occasions where her draft calendar showed Obamacare as the topic of conversation. The news appears to contradict her insistence that Obama was in the dark about problems plaguing the ill-fated healthcare.gov website in the months leading up to its October 1, 2013 launch. The Hill newspaper reported Thursday that documents released through a Freedom of Information Act request show meetings, events and phone calls where the two were together. They also show at least three breakfast or lunch meetings with close Obama adviser Pete Rouse, along with scheduled calls or meetings with presidential confidante Valerie Jarrett and White House chief of staff Denis McDonough. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has tried to insulate the president from criticism about the healthcare.gov launch, including falling on her sword during a December 11 congressional hearing . Obama has been insistent that while some bumps in the road were to be expected, he was not aware of how bad the healthcare website would be . The Obamacare website was plagued with crashes, unscheduled outages and slow response times in its first months online, causing the White House to recruit former administration official Jeff ZIents to turn it around. Throughout, Sebelius insulated the Oval Office from criticism about how the website's expensive building and disastrous unveiling were handled. During an October 22, 2013 interview on CNN, host Sanjay Gupta asked Sebelius whether or not Obama knew of the problems behind the scenes. 'No, sir,' she replied. Three weeks later, Obama denied getting a heads-up about the online disaster that would soon come. 'On the website,' he said in a Nov. 14 press conference, 'I was not informed directly that the website would not be working the way it was supposed to. Had I been informed, I wouldn’t be going out saying, boy, this is going to be great.' Five days later on Nov. 19, he told a Wall Street Journal reporter during the paper's CEO Summit that 'we probably underestimated the complexities of building out a website that needed to work the way it should.' That use of the first person pronoun 'we' is now attracting new scrutiny. Website visitors got error messages -- when they could reach it at all -- during October and November, greatly hampering the administration's ability to meet its enrollment goals . 'We should have anticipated that would create a rockier rollout than if Democrats and Republicans were both invested in success,; he added. Political land mine: Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers Jason Furman caught reporters' spears last week after a Congressional Budget Office report found that millions of jobs would be lost because of the president's health care law . Online registrations for Obamacare-linked private health insurance plans has grown to 3.3 million nationwide, according to numbers released by HHS on Wednesday, giving the White House some much-needed ammunition against critics. But the Obama administration still steadfastly refused to comment on how many Americans, or how few, have paid their premiums. A MailOnline analysis found that in five states where such statistics have been made public, just 66 per cent overall have made their first month's payment – suggesting that 2.2 million, a smaller number, are likely insured. But a survey conducted by McKinsey & Co. found that just 11 per cent of people who have enrolled in private insurance through Obamacare marketplaces were uninsured before they signed up. That indicates that the Affordable Care Act may have enrolled fewer than 250,000 people who didn't have insurance before. The Obama administration has said its goal is to enroll 7 million people by the end of March.","Kathleen Sebelius was in contact with the West Wing at least 18 times in the year before the glitchy healthcare.gov launch .

"An own goal is one of the humiliating blunders in sport. While it’s plausible that soccer players will occasionally fumble the ball into their own net, the prospect of a rugby player adding to his opposition’s scoreboard is much harder to digest. But that’s exactly what happened on Thursday night at the Rugby Championship clash between Sydney Stars and North Harbour Rays at Leichhardt Oval. Sam Grasso of Queensland Country is tackled a National Rugby Championship match with the North Harbour Rays, who have since scored Rugby's first own try . The Stars were advancing towards the try line, when Rays forward Mitch Lewis stole the ball and planted it back for a team mate to take. Mitch Lewis was visibly bewildered at the shock decision to award hi bid to clear the ball as an own try . Referee Ian Smith was unable to see over the mass of bodies and referred to the Television Match Official to settle the dispute. In a bizarre decision, Smith awarded it as an own try for Lewis, who was left bewildered, staring open mouthed towards the referee. Fans have taken to social media to express their shock at the controversial decision. Brett McKay wrote: 'How on earth is that a try?' Judge Rugby posted: 'I am still in shock at that TMO call' Sky Sports Rugby: 'Pigs might fly... Rugby's first 'own try'!' Some users suggested that Smith had mistaken Lewis for a member of the other team, likely a reference to the identical shade of yellow worn on both teams kits.

"A couple from Missouri has seen their family more than double after they adopted five orphaned siblings from Peru who had sent them an email imploring: 'We need a mommy and daddy.' Yhonson, 17, Gerson, 15, Betsi, 12, Joel, 11, and Sibila, nine, are now settling into school and home life in Blue Springs, where they saw snow for the first time after touching down in December. Before the life-changing move, they spent seven years living in an orphanage after their parents died from tuberculosis. The children refused to be split up, making adoption seem unlikely. But in January 2011, they met an American visiting the orphanage who helped them write the pleading email to send back to his friends in the United States. New additions: Scott and Lauren Sterling (back) already had two children, Logan, 19, (right) and Laney, 3, when they took in the orphans: Yhonson, 17, Gerson, 15, Betsi, 12, Joel, 11, and Sibila, 9 . When Lauren and Scott Sterling, who have a three-year-old daughter and a 19-year-old daughter from Scott's previous marriage, received the message, they didn't think too much of it. 'I remember Scott and I looking at that . e-mail and thinking about how beautiful the kids were,' Lauren, 30, wrote on her blog. 'I even . thought, ""Someone rich should adopt them"". And then life went on.' Shortly after, Lauren took a trip to an orphanage in Guatemala and was devastated by how many young babies were without parents while her own daughter had the security of a home. Then she started thinking about those five beautiful faces she had seen in the email. 'Somebody's got to do it, and why can't it be us?' Lauren said to her husband. Finally home: The Sterling brood is pictured in the airport after touching down in Missouri in December . 'We may eat a lot of spaghetti. I will never buy another $100 pair of jeans again, and who cares? If those are my reasons, it's just practicality,' she told Fox4ck. And so they embarked on the year-long . battle to bring the children from Peru to Missouri, hitting numerous . roadblocks along the way, including missing identification records for . the children. But over chats on Skype and visits to Peru, the Sterlings soon learned the different personalities of the children and began to think of them as their own. 'We got told ""no"" a lot of times, and by . then we were already crazy about these kids, so it was a rough part of . the story,' Mrs Sterling told Fox News. 'And you had to keep trusting that . we were fighting for something that you knew was yours to fight for.' Old life: The children are pictured chatting with their parents-to-be on Skype from their orphanage . Sticking together: The children had been in the orphanage for seven years after their parents died of TB . With the help of members of their . church, the Sterlings raised the $85,000 needed for the adoptions to . bring the children to their new home before Christmas. One particularly excited member of . the welcoming committee at the airport was 19-year-old Logan, who had not . seen her father, stepmother or little sister since they left for Peru . five weeks prior. She said she could not wait to meet her five new brothers and sisters. 'I haven't met them, know the personalities, know who they are,' she said. 'I'm excited about that.' The Sterlings returned to their home to find it had been scrubbed clean by the community, with a stocked kitchen, Christmas presents wrapped under the trees and new bedrooms for the children. New life: The children are now attending U.S. schools and their English is improving all the time . Sisterly love: Nine-year-old Sibila holds her new little sister, three-year-old Laney . 'People painted beds, people framed . pictures - people made the girls' room look like they had lived . here for years. It was awesome to come home to that,' Lauren said. They also returned to a garden full of snow, which the youngsters had never seen before. Life has picked up pace in the Sterling household. Scott, 43, runs a lawn care business, while Lauren has given up her recruiting job to stay at home full time. The children's English is improving and they have started attending four different schools because of their ages, making for some busy mornings in the home. 'The sound of life is different,' Lauren said. 'It's a . lot more loud and crazy, and half of it's in Spanish, half of it's in . English, and half of it's in Spanglish. But it's really good. There's a . strange peace amidst the chaos.' Brood: The community rallied around the Sterlings to help them raise enough money for the children . Moving on: The couple returned home (pictured) to new bedrooms, a stocked kitchen . and Christmas present under the tree, organised by members of their . church. They are now moving to a larger home . But life is working out well, and most of that is thanks to the children, Lauren . said. Pictures over Facebook . show them grinning alongside their new siblings and neighbours. 'These kids are fabulous. They have great attitudes,' she said. 'Nobody fought me on going back to school the second day. Everybody was up and ready, showers going on their own. So their attitudes are making the transition a bazillion times easier.' She added that as they prepare to move into a bigger home, the children's biggest concern is whether they can take the carpet.

"One in 10 Britons admit they can't go a day without a drink - more than double the international average, a new survey has revealed. People in the UK are 41 per cent more . likely to drink alcohol than in other countries, research by Bupa into 12 countries' drinking habits showed. And despite the health warnings over excess alcohol, the survey showed a third of Britons who drink claim they don't want to cut back. Danger: People in the UK are 41 per cent more likely to drink alcohol than in other countries, research into the  drinking habits of 12 countries showed . This was in contrast to international results, where almost three quarters of drinkers said they'd like to try and drink less. Experts blame the problem on too much of our social lives revolving around drinking, as well as a deep-seated resistance towards cutting back on alcohol. They also warned of the potential health consequences of excessive alcohol, including cancer, heart disease, stroke, liver disease and diabetes. The findings were part of Bupa's Health Pulse Survey, which saw the healthcare group question more than 13,000 people in 12 countries, including Australia, China, Spain, Mexico and the United States. Bupa spokesperson Dr Layla McCay said: 'This is a worrying observation which implies that Brits are particularly resistant to change when it comes to drinking habits. Pub culture: Experts blame the problem on too much of our social lives revolving around drinking, and a deep-seated resistance towards cutting back on alcohol . 'Whether that is due to the lack of awareness about the effects that alcohol can have - or whether we are simply in denial - there is clearly more work to be done to raise awareness of the associated risks and the real impact it can have on lives.' Highlighting the risks of too much alcohol, she added: 'Excessive drinking carries several health risks, including heart disease, stroke, liver disease, many types of cancer and even diabetes. 'Something needs to be done immediately and we need to challenge the social norms - social lives too often revolve around drinking and it is important we work towards coming up with healthier alternatives. 'It's not about total abstinence, but it is about drinking responsibly and being aware of the effects that heavy drinking can have.' Chris Sorek, spokesperson for alcohol awareness group Drinkaware, said: 'There is always an excuse to drink but there are plenty of reasons to cut down too. 'It can be easy to drink more than you intended, by not being aware of the units in your favourite drink or pouring large measures at home. 'However, drinking can affect your sleep patterns, meaning you wake up feeling tired and stressed the next day.' He added: 'Regularly drinking over the daily guidelines can lead to more serious health harms including alcohol-related liver disease, which has no warning signs. 'Alcohol is also the second biggest risk factor for cancer after smoking - responsible for cancer of the breast, liver, bowel and mouth.'","Britons are 41% more likely to drink alcohol than in other countries .

"David Cameron says the Koh-i-noor diamond, which Britain forced India to over in the colonial era, will not be returned. The Prime Minister ruled out handing back the 105-carat diamond during a speech on the third and final day of a visit to India aimed at drumming up trade and investment. The diamond is set in the crown of the late Queen Mother and is on display with the Crown Jewels in the Tower of London. The Crown of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, with the Koh-i-noor diamond, sits in the Tower of London with the Crown Jewels . 'The right answer is for the British Museum and other cultural institutions to do exactly what they do, which is to link up with other institutions around the world to make sure that the things which we have and look after so well are properly shared with people around the world. 'I certainly don't believe in ""returnism"", as it were. I don't think that's sensible.' Yesterday Mr Cameron became the first . serving prime minister to voice regret about the Amritsar massacre - . when 379 unarmed civilians were killed in April 1919 under the rule of . the British Empire, though the official death toll is disputed. Mr Cameron became the first serving prime minister to express regret for the 1919 Amritsar massacre of hundreds of Indian people by British colonial forces . On his visit to Amritsar, the Prime Minister was also pictured barefoot as he visited the Golden Temple . The Koh-i-noor was presented to Queen Victoria in 1850 but India wants the jewel returned . It is one of the world's largest . diamonds and some Indians - including independence leader Mahatma . Gandhi's grandson Tushar Gandhi - have demanded its return to atone for . Britain's colonial past. Mr Cameron said: 'I don't think that's the right approach.' 'It . is the same question with the Elgin Marbles,' he said, referring to the . classical Greek marble sculptures that Greece has long demanded be . given back. Britain's then colonial governor-general of India arranged for the huge diamond to be presented to Queen Victoria in 1850. If the Duchess of Cambridge becomes queen consort she will wear the crown holding the diamond on official occasions. It has only been worn by female royals, including the Queen Mother and Queen Mary, because it is said to be unlucky for men to do so. When Elizabeth II made a state visit to India to mark the 50th anniversary of India's independence from Britain in 1997, many Indians demanded the return of the diamond. Mr Cameron's is keen to tap into India's economic rise, but says he is anxious to focus on the present and future rather than 'reach back' into the past. The diamond, shown as part of Queen Alexandra's 1902 crown, is now set in a Maltese Cross in the Queen Mother's crown . The Koh-i-noor, which means 'Mountain of Light' in Urdu, was first recorded in 1306. A Hindu text at the time said: 'Only God or woman can wear it with impunity'. Rulers fought over it for centuries before Britain took it as part of the Treaty of Lahore, when it took control of the Punjab, in 1849. The jewel was seized by the Empire's East India Company as one of the spoils of war and presented to Queen Victoria in 1850. Prince Albert ordered the diamond, then weighing 186 carats, be recut to improve its brilliance. It was reduced in weight by 42 per cent and cut into an oval brilliant weighing 109 carats. The Koh-i-noor was then mounted into Victoria's crown among 2,000 other diamonds. It passed to consorts Queen Alexandra in 1902 and Queen Mary in 1911 for their coronation crowns and then to the late Queen Mother in 1937, being set in a Maltese Cross. The Queen Mother's crown is on display in the Tower of London with the Crown Jewels. It sat on top of her coffin as she lay in state in Westminster Hall in 2002. The diamond is the third largest in the Crown collection, behind the Cullinan 1 and 2 jewels cut from the Cullinan diamond - the largest rough diamond ever found. They are set in the Sovereign's sceptre with cross and the Imperial State Crown. Indian and Pakistani authorities have long demanded the diamond's return. In 1976, prime minister Jim Callaghan refused a request to hand it back, writing: 'I need not remind you of the various hands through which the stone has passed over the past two centuries, nor that explicit provision for its transfer to the British Crown was made in the peace treaty with the Maharajah of Lahore which concluded the war of 1849. 'I could not advise Her Majesty the Queen that it should be surrendered.'","Diamond was presented to Queen Victoria in 1850 under the Empire's rule .

"Two men are at the center of a baffling mystery outside Roswell, New Mexico, after they seemed to disappear from the scene of a serious car crash - only to reappear seven hours later in a field of donkeys. The unidentified men, who admitted to police they had been drinking, rolled their car around 2am on Friday outside the town synonymous with aliens and UFO's. Emergency responders and firefighters all arrived at the scene of the crash but failed to find any of the occupants of the car, but were called seven hours later by the driver who told the 911 dispatcher he had no memory of the night before. Scroll Down for Video . Rescue after a difficult night: The driver of the car is helped into an ambulance seven hours after first responders arrived at the scene of a car crash outside Roswell . New Mexico State Police Lt. Emanuel Gutierrez confirmed two men rolled their vehicle into the median of U.S. 70 West, but also said they could not find anyone at the scene. 'The driver stated that he and his passenger where drinking at Way Out West and doesn’t remember what happened next,' Gutierrez said to the Plains Online News. 'The driver also stated that he woke up in a field next to some donkeys.' While police are not releasing the identity of the driver they did say he and his passenger suffered minor injuries and issued him with multiple citations. Where have you been? The passenger in the car was also taken away by paramedics for treatment after they were recovered on Friday morning - seven hours after their crash . Roswell, New Mexico sprang to international fame on July 8, 1947, when the local newspaper reported the capture of a 'flying saucer' by government officials in the town. Over the decades since the discovery, conspiracy theorists have insisted that the debris came from an alien spacecraft, and that the fact was covered up by the military. The continuing belief of alien activity in the area led the Air Force to launch an investigation into the crash in 1995. Officials concluded that the 'UFO' was part of a balloon launched into the atmosphere as part of a secret government surveillance programme aimed at the USSR. However, many have refused to accept that explanation, alleging a conspiracy to hide the existence of extra-terrestrial life.","Driver and passenger crashed outside Roswell, New Mexico on Friday .

"It’s not just men who suffer a ‘mid-life crisis’ - chimpanzees and orangutans do too, a new study claims. Researchers set out to test the theory that the pattern of human well-being over a lifespan might have evolved in the common ancestors of humans and great apes. An international team of scientists discovered that, as in humans, chimpanzee and orangutan well-being, or happiness, follows a U-shape and is high in youth, falls in middle age, and rises again into old age. The stress of responsibility: An orang utan at Moscow zoo rests wearily in his enclosure. A new study claims that apes suffer from mid-life crises much like men do . The researchers - including economist Professor Andrew Oswald from the University of Warwick and psychologist Dr Alex Weiss from the University of Edinburgh - studied 508 great apes housed in zoos and sanctuaries in the U.S., Japan, Canada, Australia and Singapore. The apes’ well-being was assessed by keepers, volunteers, researchers and caretakers who knew the apes well. Their happiness was scored with a series of measures adapted from human subjective well-being measures. Professor Oswald said: 'We hoped to understand a famous scientific puzzle: why does human happiness follow an approximate U-shape through life? The happiest years, for apes too: Happiness in apes, as in humans, follows a U-shape - high in youth, falling in middle age, and rising again in old age . 'We ended up showing that it cannot be because of mortgages, marital break-up, mobile phones, or any of the other paraphernalia of modern life. Apes also have a pronounced mid-life low, and they have none of those.' The study is the first of its kind and the authors knew their work was likely to be unconventional. Dr Weiss said: 'Based on all of the other behavioural and developmental similarities between humans, chimpanzees, and orangutans, we predicted that there would be similarities when looking at happiness over the lifespan, too. 'However, one never knows how these things will turn out, so it’s wonderful when they are consistent with findings from so many other areas.” The team included primatologists and psychologists from Japan and the U.S. They pointed out that their findings do not rule out the possibility that economic events or social and cultural forces contribute part of the reason for the well-being U shape in humans. However, they also highlighted the need to consider evolutionary or biological explanations. For example, individuals being satisfied at stages of their life where they have fewer resources to improve their lot may be less likely to encounter situations that could be harmful to them or their families. The findings were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.","Researchers studied 508 apes housed in zoos and sanctuaries in the U.S., Japan, Canada, Australia and Singapore .

"The Vatican has rubbished Italian media reports alleging the pope's resignation is linked to a secret dossier claiming there is a 'gay network' inside the clergy. Italian newspapers have been rife with unsourced reports claiming the secret dossier from three cardinals reveals an underground network . of senior clergy who have organised gay homosexual parties and faced . blackmail. La Repubblica newspaper claims the explosive allegations were made in a report into the . so-called 'Vatileaks' scandal which was presented to the Pontiff on or . around December 17. But the Vatican today accused Italian media of spreading 'false and damaging' reports in an attempt to influence cardinals who will meet . in a secret conclave next month to elect a new pope. Scroll down for video . [caption . The report came in two volumes, 'hard-bound in red' with the title 'pontifical secret' and was compiled by Spanish cardinal, Julián Herranz; Cardinal Salvatore De Giorgi, a former archbishop of Palermo; and the Slovak cardinal Jozef Tomko. They launched the probe after the . Pope's butler, Paolo Gabriele, was arrested and charged with stealing . and leaking papal correspondence revealing how the Vatican was a centre . of intrigue and infighting. La Repubblica claimed Pope Benedict . XVI quit because could not face the repercussions of dealing with the . 300-page dossier - the first Pontiff to resign in 700 years. The paper says that the investigation . alleges a gay lobby exists within the Church, and has some sort of . control on the careers of those in the Vatican. No confirmation or denial: Vatican spokesman Father Lombardi . The report is quoted as saying: 'The cardinals were said to have uncovered an underground gay network, whose members organise sexual meetings in several venues in Rome and Vatican City, leaving them prone to blackmail. 'They included a villa outside the Italian capital, a sauna in a Rome suburb, a beauty parlour in the centre, and a former university residence that was in use by a provincial Italian archbishop.' La Repubblica says that the cardinals described a number of 'factions' in their report, including one in which individuals were 'united by sexual orientation'. The newspaper also alleges the dossier states that members of this group were blackmailed by laymen with whom they entertain relationships of a 'worldly nature' It quoted an unnamed source said to be close to the report's authors: 'Everything revolves around the non-observance of the sixth and seventh commandments.' The seventh commandment forbids theft, while the sixth forbids adultery, but is linked in Catholic doctrine to the proscribing of homosexual acts, explained the Guardian. The dossier will stay in a secret papal safe and delivered to Benedict's successor when the Pope leaves office, claims La Repubblica. The pope himself has said merely that he doesn't have the 'strength of mind and body' to carry on and would resign Feb. 28. The Vatican claims the reports are an attempt to influence the election of the next pope. The Vatican secretariat of state said the Catholic Church has for centuries insisted on the independence of its cardinals to freely elect their pope - a reference to episodes in the past when kings and emperors vetoed papal contenders or prevented cardinals from voting outright. 'If in the past, the so-called powers, i.e., States, exerted pressures on the election of the pope, today there is an attempt to do this through public opinion that is often based on judgments that do not typically capture the spiritual aspect of the moment that the church is living,' the statement said. Sent to South America: Ettore Balestrero has been promoted, according to the Vatican spokesman . 'It is deplorable that as we draw . closer to the time of the beginning of the conclave ... that there be a . widespread distribution of often unverified, unverifiable or completely . false news stories that cause serious damage to persons and . institutions.' Some Vatican watchers have speculated . that because the Vatican bureaucracy is heavily Italian, cardinals . might be persuaded to elect a non-Italian, non-Vatican-based cardinal as . pope to try to impose some reform on the Curia. Vatican spokesman the Rev. Federico . Lombardi said the reports 'do not correspond to reality' but the pope . and some of his closest collaborators have recently denounced the . dysfunction in the Apostolic Palace. Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi, for . example, criticized the 'divisions, dissent, careerism, jealousies' that . afflict the Vatican bureaucracy. He made the comments on Friday - the . penultimate day of the Vatican's weeklong spiritual exercises that were . attended by the pope and other officials. Tribute: Catholics gather to watch the Pope in one of this last public appearances . Benedict . too has made reference to the divisions in recent days, deploring in . his final Mass as pope on Ash Wednesday how the church is often . 'defiled' by attacks and divisions from within. Last Sunday, he urged . its members to overcome 'pride and egoism'. On Saturday, in his final comments to . the Curia, Benedict lamented the 'evil, suffering and corruption' that . have defaced God's creation. But he also thanked the Vatican bureaucrats . for having helped him 'bear the burden' of his ministry with their . work, love and faith these past eight years. The Vatican's attack on the media . echoed its response to previous scandals, where it has tended not to . address the underlying content of accusations, but has diverted . attention away. During the 2010 explosion of sex . abuse scandals, the Vatican accused the media of trying to attack the . pope; during the 2012 leaks scandal, it accused the media of . sensationalism without addressing the content of the leaked documents.","Italian media says dossier alleges clergy were 'united by sexual orientation'

"The last time Liverpool were due at the Bernabeu it was 2009 and Real Madrid’s interim president Vicente Boluda predicted a 3-0 win live on Spanish radio. He said Madrid would ‘blow Liverpool away’ and he even threw in a ‘2-1 away victory’ prediction for the second leg. Rafa Benitez’ Reds won 5-0 on aggregate; Boluda and Madrid were humiliated. VIDEO Scroll down to hear from Carlo Ancelotti and Brendan Rodgers ahead of teh clash . Cristiano Ronaldo scores in the 3-0 win at Anfield last month in the Champions League . Ronaldo looked roused in training ahead of Tuesday's clash at the Bernabeu in Madrid . As Liverpool land in the Spanish capital on Monday, five years on from that most impressive of European scalps, there is no need for any arrogant predictions from their opponents. Loose talk has been replaced by the sort of quiet confidence 11 straight wins (including a 3-0 victory at Anfield) tend to breed. You won’t find any Real Madrid players, coaches or directors calling the game with such contempt for the opposition, but a big home win is exactly what many of them are quietly expecting. Ronaldo has scored four more league goals for Real this season than Liverpool have managed . Carlo Ancelotti's men have won 11 on the trot, including seven straight wins in the league . Liverpool have scored 13 league goals so far this season – that is four less than Ronaldo has managed on his own. Real Madrid’s interim president Vicente Boluda predicted a 3-0 win in 2009; They lost both legs . After brushing aside Liverpool a fortnight ago Real beat Barcelona to move within one point of them, and this weekend they climbed above them in the table, going top, with another easy 4-0 away win that had Iker Casillas asking after the game if perhaps this was the greatest Madrid side he had played in. Real were always going to be a difficult proposition for Liverpool in Champions League Group B, but when they lost away to Real Sociedad earlier in the campaign – a club currently one off the bottom and with a recently sacked manager – it was a glimmer of hope for the Reds that perhaps their summer spending spree had unsettled the balance established last season. Carlo Ancelotti has ironed out the rough spots in record time however and Madrid are now playing better than at any time under the Italian’s management. Gareth Bale’s enforced absence has actually aided that process with a midfield quartet of James Rodriguez, Toni Kroos, Luka Modric and Isco all on the same wavelength in a midfield that keeps the ball as well as Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona did. 'We don’t want to be compared with anyone. We have our own philosophy,' said Modric when asked about that very comparison on Sunday. Madrid are perhaps still slightly more direct than that great Barcelona side and a fraction more goal-hungry too. Liverpool ran out 5-0 winners on aggregate after a 4-0 win at Anfield and a fine performance in Madrid . Midfielder Yossi Benayoun scores the only goal of the game back in 2009 at the Bernabeu . VIDEO Ancelotti hails 'fantastic' Ronaldo and calls for Real to maintain form . If they continue at the current scoring rate they will finish the season with 140 goals with almost 70 of them coming from the boots and head of Ronaldo, who is ready to run riot again against Liverpool’s shaky rearguard. It was Madrid that were shaky five years ago. They were passing through moments of great instability with Juande Ramos briefly replacing Bernd Schuster as coach and the aforementioned Boluda even more briefly replacing Ramos Calderon as president. Ramos had pulled things together with seven straight wins in the league but Boluda’s confidence was very misplaced, especially against a Rafa Benitez team that had Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres both in their pomp. Real Madrid have a good chance of avenging that 5-0 aggregate defeat five years ago . 'It’s easy for him to say because he will be watching the game from directors' box; he won’t be on the pitch,' said then Madrid player Arjen Robben of Boluda’s unhelpful comments. 'There are no easy games' said Ramos before he watched his side lose the first leg to a Yossi Benayoun goal and the second at Anfield to a Gerrard double, a Torres strike and another from Andrea Dossena. With the Anfield meeting already behind them – and won at such a canter – Real Madrid supporters can’t wait for Tuesday night. The Sunday papers all carried sizeable match reports from Liverpool’s defeat at Newcastle. There has never been a better time to avenge that 5-0 aggregate scoreline from five years ago.","In 2009, Real interim president Vicente Boluda predicted a 3-0 win .

"CLICK HERE to register - for FREE - and start picking your £100million squad now... As part of the build-up to the start of MailOnline's Fantasy Football season, we will be taking a look at players new to the Premier League with the potential to light up England's top tier over the coming campaign. MAURICIO ISLA IN A NUTSHELL . Isla arrives at QPR with plenty of experience from Serie A. The 26-year-old made over 150 appearances in Italy's top division with Udinese and current parent club Juventus - and that should stand him in fine stead to show his ability as a Premier League wing back. Harry Redknapp will deploy the Chilean on the right of his midfield in his favoured 3-5-2 formation, although Isla's versatility means he could be pushed further up or into a back four should Redknapp want to mix thing up. Isla boasts pace down the flank with the ability to whip the ball into the box and he should be a perfect fit at Loftus Road. New in blue (and red, and black): Mauricio Isla poses for a photo at Loftus Road after sealing his move . Getting to grips with the best: Isla takes on Brazil's Neymar during his time with Chile at the World Cup . Born: Buin, Chile, June 12, 1988 (age 26) Position: Right wing back/midfielder . Previous clubs: Udinese, Juventus . 2007-2012: Udinese (127 appearances, 6 goals) 2012-: Juventus (29 apps, 0 goal) World Cup 2014 . Appearances: 4 . Tackles won: 6 . Blocks: 4 . Recovered balls: 22 . Pass Completion: 76.9% . Stats from FIFA.com . WHY YOU SHOULD HAVE ISLA IN YOUR MAILONLINE FANTASY FOOTBALL TEAM . Wing backs look to be a popular option with a lot of Premier League sides this year - and that offers the perfect option for Fantasy Football managers looking for more points from their defenders. Playing out at right wing back should give Isla the chance to run up and down that wing and with his crossing ability he will weigh in with a good few assists especially with a poacher like Charlie Austin to aim for. And at just £4.1million - why not go for him? That's £0.6m cheaper than Liverpool's hapless centre back Kolo Toure! TOP LEVEL EXPERIENCE . Isla was one of Chile's many stars that impressed with their brilliant team play at this summer's World Cup. They were unlucky to be beaten on penalties by hosts Brazil and Isla looked pretty good - making his loan signing a bit of a coup for QPR. There's not just that though - Isla has played in the Champions League with Juventus too, so he should have no trouble adapting to the testing conditions of the Premier League. BUT HOW WILL HE PICK UP POINTS? Attacking runs up the flank should provide a fair share of assists for a defender - while Isla should be an almost certain starter for the Rs, meaning plenty of appearance points. You wouldn't expect someone from a newly promoted side to pick up much in terms of clean sheets but that might be a bit different for QPR. Harry Redknapp knows the league well and with experienced defenders like Rio Ferdinand and the quality of Steven Caulker helping out in defence, there's still potential for bonuses for Fantasy Football managers. Italian touch: Isla in action during a Champions League game with Galatasaray for his parent club Juventus . Skillful: You can rely on Isla to grab some assist points in Fantasy Football - perfect for any manager . DON'T JUST TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT . Harry Redknapp knows a thing or two about what makes a good Premier League player - and he seems excited to see Isla in action for his newly promoted side. 'He's a top player and we're delighted to have him here,' Redknapp said. 'He showed his quality in the World Cup for Chile and it's a great loan signing for us.' 'He’s a versatile player, he’s full of energy. I’m confident he’ll be a really big asset for us this season.' Redknapp's words seem to indicate that he would even be happy playing Isla further up the field should the Rs change formation - great news for Fantasy Football managers looking to get more out of their defenders. Energetic: Isla will be up and down the flank for QPR this season - let's hope for big points from him!","QPR signed Mauricio Isla from Juventus on loan earlier this month .

"Oliver Kahn believes Joe Hart needs to find greater consistency if he is to get anywhere near the level of Manuel Neuer. The two goalkeepers meet again at the end of the month when Bayern Munich travel to Manchester City in the Champions League, the brilliant Neuer presenting a formidable barrier to the Blues' hopes of reaching the knock-out stages of the tournament for the first time.

'He was shifting goalkeeping on the next level but we will see what happens in future. 'It's difficult to compare him with goalkeepers of the past because it's difficult to compare different generations, but at the moment he is the best goalkeeper in the world.

Neuer is rated as the world's best goalkeeper by the former Bayern Munich legend . The German keeper changed the way the position was played en route to winning the 2014 World Cup . Kahn, speaking at the DohaGoals 2014 forum in Qatar, said Hart remains susceptible to mistakes and that is the main difference between the two men. 'Neuer makes a lot less mistakes than Hart,' Kahn said. 'If you look at him there are some games where he plays not very well, Manuel is more on a constant level than Hart.

Few give the Reds a hope of getting anything out of the game, never mind repeating their famous 1-0 win here in 2009 - a masterclass in tactical discipline by former boss Rafael Benitez. But Rodgers stressed there would be no conceding this game - even though the reality remains that their Group B future will be decided by the final two matches against Basle and Bulgarian minnows Ludogorets. 'We are certainly not coming here as a team expecting to lose and then look at the other games as games to qualify,' Rodgers said. 'For us, we see it as an opportunity. We still very much have qualification in our hands. 'It is a wonderful arena - one of the iconic football grounds in the world - and, when you come up against the best opponents, that is the challenge and what makes you perform to your best. 'They are probably the best team in the world at the moment and we really look forward to big games. 'We see them as an opportunity rather than a threat to what we are doing.

Liverpool ran out 5-0 winners on aggregate after a 4-0 win at Anfield and a fine performance in Madrid in 2009 . 'Our defence have come under quite a bit of criticism. It is nowhere near as bad as people make out. 'What has been the frustration defensively has been the mistakes and sloppy goals we have given away. 'There haven't been too many times when the team has been outdone. 'When you have an attacking philosophy you are going to be susceptible in your defensive side because you are not sat with nine players behind the ball. 'You are looking to control and dominate the game, but we have to eradicate the errors. 'The key, even though we know it is tough, is to make sure we are compact and disciplined in our game. 'I think we showed in the previous game, although the score was 3-0, we can still have moments when we can hurt Real Madrid and that will be the idea (on Tuesday). 'There is absolutely no question we have the courage. This is a team and a group of players who have been so brave to take on the challenge I have asked them to.'","Liverpool face a daunting task against Real Madrid on Wednesday .

"Finally, Sunderland have had a happy Monday. After 12 years and 21 games, they won a match on a Monday, clinching a vital win against Crystal Palace. But while Gus Poyet enjoyed his start to the week, the same can’t be said of Neil Warnock. The Palace boss left incensed after referee Phil Dowd failed to award his side what looked a clear penalty inside the opening 25 seconds.

Att: 23,212 . Warnock is already in hot water with the FA over comments made about referee Craig Pawson following the defeat by Chelsea last month. And he may find himself in further trouble after another rant after last night’s loss. ‘I think everyone knows it was a penalty, I think the only chance we’ve got of getting a penalty at the moment is if a player picks up the ball and throws it at the referee,’ said the Palace boss. ‘We are at Manchester United next, I don’t think we’ll get many decisions there. Major decisions change games and major decisions haven’t gone for us.’ There’s no doubt about it, Sunderland got away with one, and Poyet knew it too. ‘It was time for us to get a little bit of luck,’ said the Sunderland boss. ‘We’ve not had much so far this way. What’s important is that we take advantage of that luck and win the game. ‘It means a lot — it means more than anyone can think. It’s been a difficult couple of weeks.’ Spectators were still finding their seats as the night’s main talking point unfolded. There looked to be no danger as Marouane Chamakh flicked on Scott Dann’s hoist forward, but as Sunderland hesitated in dealing with the second ball, Fraizer Campbell burst past John O’Shea into the box. Santiago Vergini lunged but failed to make any contact with the ball before taking Campbell’s legs away from him. Selhurst Park rose to its feet fully expecting a penalty, but Dowd waved Palace’s appeals away. Warnock was less than impressed. You can only wonder how he felt when he saw the replays. It was as clear a penalty as you’ll see this season. In the aftermath, the Palace boss approached fourth official Mike Jones. Not long after, Dowd made his way over to the Palace bench for a word with Warnock. Having conceded 10 goals in their last two games, Poyet would have been content to see his side on level terms after 30 minutes.He’d have been ecstatic three minutes later as Sunderland took the lead.

There was a hint of offside as Patrick van Aanholt collected the ball down the left — but as Palace appealed for a free-kick the Dutchman found Steven Fletcher, who leaped highest to plant a header past Julian Speroni. Palace had a second penalty appeal dismissed by Dowd two minutes after Fletcher’s goal when Van Aanholt collided with Wilfried Zaha down the right. Again, the Sunderland player made little or no contact with the ball. If Warnock was angry at his side’s first failed penalty shout, he was apoplectic with this one. But in Dowd’s defence, replays showed that the tangle occurred just outside the box. The incident was Van Aanholt’s final contribution, as he was carried off after lengthy treatment following the collision with Zaha. Palace’s predicament could easily have worsened before the break as the Black Cats were denied three times by Speroni; Fletcher, Vergini and Wickham all denied by the Argentine.

"Mauricio Pochettino's development of Luke Shaw at Southampton helped to convince fellow left-back Ben Davies to join the Argentinian when he made the move to Tottenham this summer. An impressive 18-month spell at the Southampton helm persuaded Spurs that Pochettino was the right man to take the reins at White Hart Lane. Pochettino last season led Saints to their best ever Premier League campaign, playing an attractive, high-pressing game with a team full of British talent whose talents he helped hone. New man: Left-back Ben Davies (left) moved to Tottenham Hotspur from Swansea City this summer . Inspiration: Mauricio Pochettino's move to Tottenham Hotspur convinced Ben Davies to follow him there . The likes of Adam Lallana, Calum Chambers and Shaw have moved on to pastures new as a result, with the latter leaving for Manchester United in a world-record deal for a teenager. The left-back improved markedly during his time under Pochettino and Davies, one of the Argentinian's first signings at Tottenham, hopes his game will be taken on in a similarly impressive fashion. 'He was massive,' Davies said. 'To have an up-and-coming manager that has shown the qualities he has got, it is great to have someone like him show a lot of faith in you and that he really wants you here. 'I was delighted when I knew the interest was there and he made it easy for me after speaking to him. 'It has shown a lot of faith in me, bringing me here. I am grateful for that. 'It was an opportunity I wanted to take, really, and I am sure he is expecting me to settle into his system as quickly as possible. 'I think the way we used to play at Swansea and the way that he likes to play in keeping the ball and moving it around as quickly as possible suits my game. 'I think he could have seen that in me and hopefully I can bring that to this team.' Development: Pochettino's work with Luke Shaw at Southampton encouraged Davies to move to Spurs . Pochettino's style relies heavily on his full-backs, who are expected to race down the flanks as well as be steady defensive operators. One Saints player joked they needed two hearts to play in that manner, but Davies is loving it. 'It is sometimes (like you could do with an extra heart) at full-back when he expects you to kind of be a winger and a defender at the same time, but that is part of my game,' he said, chuckling. 'I am a pretty fit player and I enjoy that, playing under him, and it allows me to play my game. 'He has been great with all the lads and hopefully the system he wants us to play we can adapt to as quickly as possible. It'll definitely be able to pick us up results.' Davies made his Spurs debut on Thursday night, playing the full 90 minutes as they came from behind to secure a 2-1 win at AEL Limassol in the Europa League play-offs. Pointing the way: Davies believes that Pochettino can help him develop and move forward with his game . It was far from an easy match, thanks in no small part to the Cypriot heat and spirited opponents, and could mean the Wales international drops to the bench against QPR on Sunday, with Danny Rose starting instead. Having just penned a new five-year deal, the Yorkshireman looks set to be a rival for a long time to come but it is competition that Davies thrives on. 'It is going to make us both better players, hopefully, and that's all we want to do as professionals,' he said. 'It is a good competition between us and we will be supporting each other whichever way it goes, really. 'Dan has been great to me since I've come in. He has help me settle well. 'I could have easily expected to come in and have someone give me the cold shoulder, but I can't say that about him. Credit to him. 'He has been great to me and it is a competition between us. We both want that number one jersey, but whoever does get it at the end of the day we are supporting the team and we'll support each other. That's the way it is going to be.'

"Danny Rose believes Harry Redknapp deserves a warm welcome this weekend when he makes his first return to White Hart Lane since being sacked by Tottenham. Over the course of nearly four years in north London, the 67-year-old transformed Spurs from relegation candidates to regular Champions League contenders. It was the most successful period of Spurs' recent history but Redknapp was shown the door in June 2012 after a promising season tailed off amid widespread links to the England hotseat. Return: Redknapp will be back at White Hart Lane on Sunday, where he spent four successful years . Respect: Redknapp should get a good reception according to Rose after his achievements with Spurs . Andre Villas-Boas and Tim Sherwood have come and gone since then, with Redknapp still the only man to have led Spurs into the Champions League. It is that success which makes Rose confident that the sometimes divisive, always outspoken manager will get a decent welcome when he brings QPR to White Hart Lane on Sunday. 'He was one of the most successful managers the club has had, with him getting the club into the Champions League, so he should get a good reception,' said the left-back. 'In terms of the football he had the team playing, he got the best out of Luka Modric, the best out of Gareth Bale, and lot of players, so I think he should get a warm welcome. 'QPR lost against Hull on the opening day of the season but we know it will be a difficult game. Spurs connection: Redknapp and coach Glenn Hoddle are both former Tottenham manager . Up against it: Rose says it will be a difficult game against QPR but hopes his side can pick up the win . 'With an old manager coming back, they will be looking to get three points. It will be a very hard game but games at home we should be looking to get three points.' Victory against QPR would continue a fine start to life at the helm for Mauricio Pochettino. Coaxed to White Hart Lane after an impressive 18 months at Southampton, the QPR match will be the former Argentina defender's first competitive match at White Hart Lane and comes fresh from leading Spurs to back-to-back victories at West Ham and AEL Limassol. 'I spoke to Jack Cork at Southampton before I met the manager and he had nothing but nice things to say about him,' Rose said. 'It is hard work but I am enjoying working under him. He is like one of the lads, having a laugh, but everyone knows that as soon as training starts he is very serious. 'All he demands is hard work and that is exactly what he has got form everyone throughout pre-season.' Flying start: Pochettino has enjoyed an impressive opening two games with wins against West Ham and AEL . Pochettino's demanding approach is well-documented and one which Spurs will hope bears fruit as they take on QPR just days after an energy-sapping trip to Cyprus. A bobbly, cut-up pitch and temperatures in the 30s made life difficult for the north Londoners, who looked set to lose to an early AEL goal from Adrian Sardinero in the first leg of their Europa League play-off. However, the introduction of Erik Lamela midway through the second half turned the game, the schemer setting up Roberto Soldado and Harry Kane within eight minutes of coming on to secure an unlikely 2-1 win. Having a laugh: Erik Lamela is beginning to settle in at Tottenham and his performances are improving . It was a belated glimpse of the quality which saw Tottenham fork out a club-record fee last summer and, after a difficult debut season, Rose is confident the Argentinian will prove his worth this term. 'We were allowed a night out in America and we all saw a different side to him,' he said. 'He really came out of his shell and was having a laugh and a joke with everybody. 'I was warming up with him last night and you could tell he was raring to get on the pitch. 'He did well to assist Robbie for the first and then was involved in the second. We are all happy for him. 'He has got a lot of quality, especially going forward. He will be looking forward to showing everyone what he can do this season.'","Redknapp managed Spurs for almost four years .

"With its dramatic lighting effects and blaring music, tennis at the O2 Arena is far removed from Wimbledon and Andy Murray will hope that next week proves markedly different from his last match on British soil. After that deflating summer quarter-final exit at SW19, the 27-year-old Scot’s form has revived sufficiently for him to qualify for the season-end climax in London and he was kept apart from world No 1 Novak Djokovic in the group stages. Instead he has Roger Federer as his toughest assignment as he tries to make it through to the last four of the Barclays ATP World Finals. Andy Murray will be part of the eight-man field at the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals in London . And if he wants to avoid Djokovic in the semis it is likely he will have to top his round-robin section. That will not be easy, with Federer in such excellent late-season form that he still has a mathematical chance of toppling the Serb as the year-end No 1. Murray — who missed the tournament last year due to back surgery — also finds himself up against US Open finalist Kei Nishikori and huge-serving Canadian Milos Raonic, who has given him problems in the past. In the absence of Rafael Nadal, who underwent surgery on his appendix, eight of the world’s top nine are on show but Djokovic is again very much the man to beat. The Serb won the title in 2012 and 2013 and his aggregate record against his three group opponents is an overwhelming 41-5. Djokovic will therefore be expected to top his group, especially as the man who beat him at the Australian Open, Stan Wawrinka, is struggling for form after losing four out of six matches since the US Open. Murray (left) lost to Roger Federer in the quarter-finals of the Australian Open in Melbourne earlier this year . Novak Djokovic (right) lifts the trophy after winning the Paris Masters on Sunday as David Luiz looks on . Murray will open proceedings on Sunday afternoon against Nishikori — the first Asian player to have qualified for this event — and the match has the look of a must-win. His record against Federer is 11-11 but he has lost three times to the great Swiss at the O2, and when they met two years ago the match was best remembered for the way the crowd, which always has a large international element, was more in favour of the saintly Roger than the home player. For all the renewed confidence he has gleaned since winning three ATP titles in six weeks, Murray is unlikely to find Raonic easy either. Although he generally plays well against tall players with big serves, the Scot has lost three times out of four when he has met the big Canadian, who only qualified with Nishikori late on Friday night. Removed from the rarefied world of the top players, there was some encouragement for the British men’s game with significant ranking rises for Britain’s No 2 and No 3 players, James Ward and Liam Broady. Djokovic (left) is defending champion after beating Spaniard Rafael Nadal in last year's final at the O2 Arena . VIDEO I saved my best till last - Djokovic . Ward, the 27 year-old Londoner, has moved up to 111 and is now very close to securing a place in January’s Australian Open main draw if he can perform well at a Challenger event this week in Melbourne. Stockport’s former junior Wimbledon finalist, Liam Broady, has enjoyed a sudden run of form and his reward for making his first Challenger final at Charlottesville in Virginia on Sunday night was to make it up to 199. Having begun the year outside the top 500 it has been an impressive surge from the 20-year-old. From what looked a decent generation of British juniors, he is the first to crack the world’s top 200, slightly unexpectedly after a period of stagnation when he first tried to break into the senior ranks.","Andy Murray has been drawn in Group B along with Roger Federer .

"Manchester City’s billionaire owner will help fund the redevelopment of Real Madrid’s Bernabeu stadium after a company he heads struck a £350million investment deal with the European champions. Sheikh Mansour is chairman of International Petroleum Investment Company (IPIC), which uses Abu Dhabi’s wealth to fund projects around the world. Those now include the renovation of the iconic ground over the next three years after the confirmation of a ‘long-term strategic partnership’ with Real. But Sheik Mansour’s role will not infringe on UEFA’s rules over club ownership because the deal does not mean the Abu Dhabi royal family will hold a stake in Real.

"We've all been there — bored to tears at school, clock-watching, thinking you might actually nod off. And then Real Madrid hammer on the classroom door and pull you out of the lesson so you can fly to Norway and sit on the bench in a Champions League group game against Rosenborg. Iker Casillas was 16 years old when he was taken out of a technical drawing class to join up with the Real squad in 1997. Against Liverpool he will become the man who has played more games in the competition — 144 —than any other. He has won it three times in a 15-year first-team career and he has news for anyone who might think his time at the top is almost up. Iker Casillas celebrates winning the Champions League with Real Madrid after beating rivals Atletico Madrid . Casillas has won three Champions League titles during his 15 years in the Real Madrid first team . ‘I think I can play on until I’m 40,’ Casillas told Sportsmail. And he doesn’t mean play on in less demanding surroundings. ‘I started here and I want to finish here,’ he says, crushing any talk that this will be his last season at the club. He has become the villain in the eyes of some supporters in recent years. A whispering campaign pinned him, mistakenly he says, as the mole in the dressing room that Jose Mourinho gradually lost control of at Real Madrid. But there are also those at the club who will always see him as the local kid made good. ‘They pulled me out of school because Bodo Illgner and Santi Cañizares were injured and they needed me as a second keeper,’ he says of that day back in November 1997. ‘I was taken to the headmaster, who by the way was a big Madrid fan, and before I knew it I was on a school minibus going home, where my mum was frantically packing my bag for me. The other kids had no idea why I had left the class and there was no Twitter or mobile phones to tell them what was happening.’ Casillas' reputation was damaged when it was claimed he was a dressing room mole under Jose Mourinho . Cañizares ended up recovering and young Iker was only Real’s third keeper but coach Jupp Heynckes still told him to get changed and take his place on the bench. ‘I knew who they all were, but no-one had a clue who I was,’ he says of his illustrious team-mates. ‘I sat on the same table before the game as Cañizares and Fernando Morientes but I never said a word.’ Casillas says he hasn’t ‘done the maths’ as to how many games he will play in the Champions League. ‘The immediate challenge is to win it two years in a row,’ he says. ‘If we show the same desire we did last year, why not? First we have to get through to the knockout stages.’ Defeating Liverpool would make sure of that but he sees one major reason why it will not be as easy as some are suggesting. ‘Liverpool have to win,’ he says. ‘English teams never back down. Liverpool will come here to a stadium where they have won before and they will give it everything.’ The visitors have their own Casillas in Steven Gerrard: the one-club man whom the Real keeper calls ‘the essence of Liverpool’. The Real legend trains while summer signing and Costa Rican international Keylor Navas watches on . Casillas will make his 144th Champions League appearance when his side take on Liverpool at the Bernabeu . ‘These are the players that give the club its identity,’ he says. ‘Carles Puyol and Xavi at Barcelona and Totti at Roma — players with a genuine link to the supporters. And if you are happy and playing well at a big club then you never have a reason to go anywhere else.’ Having sought Gerrard out for a shirt swap at Anfield, Casillas says he will look for Mario Balotelli, although not at half-time. ‘You can swap shirts at half-time in Spain and it’s no problem,’ he says of Balotelli’s troubles a fortnight ago. Casillas’s career at Madrid has brought him grief and glory. Mourinho benched him, bringing in Diego Lopez, whom he said he felt was a better keeper. Carlo Ancelotti’s diplomatic solution to the over-booking he inherited was to play Lopez in the league and Casillas in the Spanish Cup and the Champions League. He promptly won the two tournaments he was part of while Madrid could finish only third in the league. Casillas said he will look to swap shirts with Mario Balotelli when his side take on Liverpool . Casillas has won five league titles, three Champions Leagues, the World Cup and two European Championships . The Champions League won last May in Lisbon was the club’s 10th and in the ecstasy of the immediate aftermath he told reporters it felt even better than winning the World Cup, although he now puts that down to the sheer relief as his mistake that allowed Atletico Madrid to score the opening goal no longer mattered. ‘When it happens you stand there on the goal-line thinking about it and you want to leave your penalty area and try to get the equaliser yourself but you know you can’t. So you can imagine how I felt when Sergio Ramos’s header went in. ‘One of the sad things about football is that people only remember the most recent thing you have done. My mistake allowed Atletico to take the lead. Winning a trophy is not about one game, it’s about the whole season and fighting to reach the final and my season in the competition had been very good. ‘But we had been in control of the game and an absurd moment from me looked like costing us the match. ‘I remember looking around the stadium and seeing thousands of people with the white shirts and I felt terrible. Luckily in the last move of the game we got the draw and then I think the extra time reflected how much better we really were. Casillas is captain of both Real Madrid and Spain, and has made 158 appearances for his country . ‘Sergio’s goal rescued me from a lot of criticism. I’m sure quite a few papers had to change their headlines in that last minute.’ It takes a certain type of toughness to succeed at a club like Real Madrid for so long. Casillas has bounced back this season. His form of late for his club side has been excellent. The mistake against Slovakia paved the way for David de Gea, whom he describes as ‘both the present and future of Spanish football’, to replace him for the national side but he says he’ll keep playing with the Spain team until at least Euro 2016. And with Real the obsession for the decima has quickly been replaced by the need to win the undecima (11th). ‘This club is so big that winning the European Cup buys you about a month’s grace,’ he smiles. ‘When you have as good a team as we have then you have to try to go out and win it again.

"The lives of indigenous groups living in the remote Siberian Arctic have been revealed in a series of stunning images by a British photographer. Taken by Bryan Alexander, the 40 photographs feature images of Chukchi, Dolgan, Even, Khanty, Komi, Nenets, and Nganasan people. It shows how they live today in their native communities, their traditional camps, transportation and dress as well as activities such as herding, hunting and fishing. The series of striking images includes a herd of 1,000 reindeer being driven across the tundra in Khanty Mansiysk; the Northern Lights over a Nenets reindeer herders camp and Khanty women in traditional dress in Pitlyar. The vast size of Siberia, combined with the isolation of many of its northern communities, has ensured that these unique Arctic cultures have survived to this day. Only a minority of Arctic peoples still maintain the old ways, but traditional activities remain important both culturally and economically. The name of the exhibition, Whisper of the Stars, comes from Sakha Republic (Yakutia) in Eastern Siberia, where the extreme winter cold creates a strange phenomenon. When the temperature drops below -50C, a soft whooshing sound can sometimes be heard, like rice or grain being poured. This noise is caused by the moisture in one's own exhaled breath turning to ice crystals in the cold dry air. Bryan Alexander specialises in documenting the life of the Arctic's indigenous peoples and the issues that affect them. In 1971, he used a Royal Society of Arts travel bursary to visit North West Greenland. There he lived in a small Inuit community for four months, which began a lifetime of documenting the Arctic and its people. Bryan has spent more than ten of the past 43 years living in isolated native camps and villages around the Arctic. The exhibition will take place at the Horniman Museum in London until September 7.

"Brendan Rodgers was sat in the press room at St James’ Park when he began answering a question about Real Madrid. By the time he had finished, the subject of his response had kicked off their La Liga match in Granada and were 1-0 up inside 90 seconds thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo. Rodgers, unwittingly, had spoken of holding no fear ahead of Tuesday’s trip to the Bernabeu. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ancelotti hailing 'fantastic' Ronaldo . Cristiano Ronaldo (left) looks in good spirits as he trains alongside Gareth Bale on Monday morning . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers arrives at Melwood on Monday ahead of the journey to Madrid . Had one of the televisions inside the room been relaying Real’s game then he might have revised his response. The European champions are, at present, in frightening form. In their last six matches they have plundered 24 goals, Barcelona and Liverpool among those vanquished in that period. Indeed, you must trawl back to May for the last time they failed to score in a league fixture. Free-scoring, however, Liverpool are not – freefall would be a more apt description of late. They have drawn blanks in three of their last four, and even then the 2-1 League Cup victory over Swansea arrived courtesy of two goals in the final four minutes. Rodgers insists that he welcomes the trip to the Spanish capital, ‘They’re all great games, aren’t they?’, was his reply when asked about the prospect of his side taking on Real amid their current struggle. Ayoze Perez fires the opening goal past Simon Mignolet as Newcastle beat Liverpool 1-0 on Saturday . Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard (left) applauds the fans as Newcastle players celebrate their victory . His tone, however, betrayed his trepidation, for he knows what lies in wait. After all, it was Liverpool just last season who terrified anyone who dared to venture to Anfield Road. That is why they are here in the Champions League. But that team – inspired by Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge and a carefree Raheem Sterling – does not exist any more, or certainly not right now. At Newcastle on Saturday during their 1-0 defeat, they were void of energy and invention, a team low on confidence and seemingly with no answers as to how to halt their slide. Meanwhile, in Spain, Ronaldo was scoring his 22nd goal of the campaign – that is three more than the entire Liverpool squad combined. It was he who broke the deadlock in quite brilliant fashion at Anfield a fortnight ago when he strode on to James Rodriguez’s exquisite through-chip and hooked into the top corner. Karim Benzema added two more with alarming ease. Liverpool players show their dejection during the 3-0 defeat by Real Madrid at Anfield a fortnight ago .

At Granada, it was Ronaldo, a Rodriguez double and Benzema on target in a comfortable 4-0 success – the leading men are at the top of their game. Add to that the return of Gareth Bale and you would perhaps forgive Rodgers for adopting a ‘damage limitation’ approach when the action gets underway. There is also, of course, the not-so-trivial matter of revenge. It was during the last-16 stage of 2008-09 that Liverpool enjoyed a 5-0 two-legged triumph.

Gerrard was wise before the event and so it transpired that Real were easy victors.

"Cristiano Ronaldo now seems to rewrite the goalscoring history books every week, and with Saturday’s latest strike for Real Madrid the Portugal superstar broke a La Liga record that had stood for 79 years. Ronaldo’s second-minute goal in Real’s 4-0 victory over Granada on Saturday took his total to 17 in the opening 10 games of the Spanish league season. That surpassed Isidro Langara’s long-standing record of 16 goals for Real Oviedo in 1935. Last month the 29-year-old superstar beat Esteban Echevarria’s record from 1943 of 14 goals in seven La Liga games after scoring a double in a 5-0 win over Levante. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ronaldo shows off  'back-ups' in Real Madrid training . Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates yet another goal for Real Madrid during Saturday's win at Granada . Ronaldo during Madrid training on Monday ahead of the Champions League clash against Liverpool . The Portugal star gets on the ball to practice his passing (well, he hardly needs to sharpen his shooting!) What makes Ronaldo’s feat even more impressive is that he has played in one game less than Langara, having missed one match for Real this season. Ronaldo has also scored for 13 games in succession in all competitions. 17 goals in nine league games this season. 274 goals in 261 games for Real Madrid. 194 goals in 174 La Liga games. 26 hat-tricks. 22 La Liga hat-tricks. 17 Champions League goals in 2013-14. If he keeps up his scoring average of 1.7 goals per game, Ronaldo could end up with a staggering 65 league strikes to his name this season, should he play every one of Real’s remaining fixtures. That would comfortably beat Lionel Messi’s remarkable record of 50 goals in a La Liga season, set in 2011-12. The Barcelona striker’s goals-per-game average then was 1.4. Ronaldo already holds the record for the most goals in a 38-game Premier League season. He notched 31 goals in the 2007-8 season, a feat matched by Luis Suarez for Liverpool last term, before moving to Madrid for a then world record fee of £80million in 2009. Ronaldo (left) scores from the penalty spot against Barcelona during last week's El Clasico . Raul’s record of 323 goals for Madrid is the big number in Ronaldo’s sights, and with 274 to his name already it is seemingly inevitable that record will also be smashed. In fact, should Ronaldo keep up his current La Liga scoring ratio this term and Real progress to the later stages of the Champions League and/or the Copa del Rey, he is guaranteed to do it before the end of this season.

"Tottenham defender Zeki Fryers has joined Crystal Palace on a three-year deal after completing his medical. The 21-year-old product of the Manchester United youth academy has moved to Selhurst Park to become the Eagles' first signing of transfer deadline day for £3million. Fryers made only two Barclays Premier League appearances during his spell at Old Trafford before moving to play in Belgium with Standard Liege. VIDEO Scroll down for Neil Warnock returns to Crystal Palace for unfinished business . Job done: Zeki Fryers poses with the Crystal Palace shirt after completing his £3million switch from Spurs . Committed: But Fryers failed to tie down a place in the Spurs team and has joined Palace on a three-year deal . The England Under 19 international returned to England when he signed for Spurs in 2013 but could not establish himself at White Hart Lane. Fryers revealed he was first made aware of Palace's interest over the weekend and becomes Neil Warnock's second addition since the 65-year-old replaced Tony Pulis as manager in south London. 'I found out over the weekend from my agent that there was interest and I knew Crystal Palace were the best club for me at this time of my career,' said Fryers. Back in town: Neil Warnock has returned to Crystal Palace after he was appointed for a second spell . 'I am very excited to be here and it's a fresh start for me now. I can't wait to get out on the training pitch and show what I can do. 'I have met Neil Warnock this morning and we had a good chat about the game and things on and off the pitch. I am really looking forward to working with such a great manager and getting to know my new team-mates.' Warnock returned for a second stint managing Palace last week, succeeding Pulis, who quit the club on the eve of the new Premier League season after a row with the board over transfer policy. The former Sheffield United boss' first act in charge at Selhurst Park was to complete the season-long loan deal for Wilfried Zaha's return from Manchester United. Zaha fired an injury-time goal at Newcastle on Saturday as Palace stole a 3-3 draw in the north east.","Crystal Palace have completed the £3million signing of Fryers from Spurs .

"Tottenham go into their second London derby in as many weeks after the White Hart Lane outfit beat West Ham 1-0 in their Premier League season opener last Saturday. Their opponents QPR don't have the luxury of points yet, having been beaten at Loftus Road by the same scoreline by Hull City.

"The Texas high schooler who told off his teacher for being lazy, in a video that went viral this week, says in a new interview that he has no regrets about his in-class rant. Jeff Bliss, a sophomore at Duncanville High School in Texas, said that someone needed to stand up to the instructor who he accused of relying too much on handouts and not actually teaching. 'I want to see a teacher stand up and interact with the students, get involved, discuss, talk, question and get deep into the subject,' he told WFAA-TV on Thursday. Scroll down for video. Impassioned: Jeff Bliss, a student at Duncanville High School in Texas, says he has no regrets about launching a tirade about his teacher's poor performance in the classroom . No holds barred: Jeff Bliss, 18, gave his teacher a tongue lashing in a 90-second video that was uploaded to YouTube and has been viewed over 2 million times . The 18-year-old told the local news station that the monologue criticizing his world history teacher, believed to be Julie Phung, was sparked by a complaint he made in class about how students didn't have enough time to prepare for the STAAR test. STARR, the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness, are standardized tests given to students in grades three to 11. The teacher kicked him out of the class for asking too many questions and Bliss decided to seize the moment and lay out his thoughts on her less than impressive teaching style. 'If you would just get up and teach . them instead of handing out a freaking packet. There's kids in here who . don't learn like that. They need to learn face to face,' he said in his impassioned plea, that was recorded by a classmate. As the student exited the room, he began unleashing on the woman and telling her that she could do a better job engaging with the students. 'You want kids to come to class? You want them to get excited? You gotta come in here, you gotta make 'em excited, to change him and make him better, you gotta touch his freakin' heart,' he added. The 90-second video was uploaded to the web on May 8 and took the web by storm. In just a few days it has been viewed over 2 million times and many have come out to support the articulate student delivering his dreams of better education in the classroom. Bliss said he has no regrets about his speech but didn't expect this kind of attention. 'I believe that someone needed to say this,' he told the news station. Pride: Jeff Bliss's mother Rhonda, back right, is a teacher and is proud that her son was confident enough to speak his mind . The student's mother is a teacher and he said that he learned the value of education when he dropped out of school for one year. 'Without an education, I'm not going to make any steps forward into the future,' he added. Bliss' mother, Rhonda, has come out to support her son and is proud that he spoke his mind. The school has responded, saying that it encourages students to be engaged but believes Bliss could have found a more appropriate way to vent his feelings. Duncanville ISD Superintendent Alfred Ray told the local news, 'I think the setting and the tone could have very well been different. I think that Mr Bliss probably understands that himself, but I tell you that our core beliefs value all of the individuals in our district and we value the input Jeff has as we would for every student in our district.' Aftermath: Officials at Duncanville High School have placed the teacher on administrative leave and are investigating what led the student to launch his scathing criticism . The district announced this week that they wouldn't be punishing Jeff for the rant. Meanwhile, the teacher in the video has been placed on administrative leave while the school investigates what led to Bliss being kicked out of class. He alleges she said something profane to him before he launched into his tirade. Though Bliss' speech has become wildly popular, he also has his critics. 'His choice of protest venues and methods is one I will never celebrate,' Dallas Morning News editorial writer Ted Robberson wrote in an op-ed on Friday. 'He owes everyone involved an apology. And if he ever makes it onto the Today show, that might be an excellent venue to do it.'","High school student Jeff Bliss was filmed ranting at world history teacher .

"In the age of Facebook, most people can't resist taking a quick peak at their significant other's old pictures. Normally though, that's enough to satisfy the curiosity. Not so for one love struck boyfriend from Zhengzhou, in China's Henan province. Wan used Photoshop to superimpose himself onto his girlfriend's childhood photos . He has posed to make it look as if he belong in the family pictures . He posted the edited pictures onto social networking site Weibo to mark the couple's fourth anniversary . Identified only as Wan, the man has used photo-editing software Photoshop to superimpose himself into his girlfriend's childhood snaps - even choreographing poses to make himself fit into the pictures - and then posted them on Chinese social network Weibo to mark the couple's fourth anniversary. He captioned them with the, slightly unnerving, message: 'I want to send my love letter to little you, but without a time machine, the only thing I can do is come into your dream to meet you'. Could Wan's, as of yet unnamed, girlfriend expect an actual present to mark four years together? Not quite. He wrote: 'I am sorry I don’t have a surprise for you, because I believe staying with you in the past four years is the biggest surprise.' It is not known how the girlfriend reacted to the photos but they have divided opinions on the internet. They have nearly 3,300 'likes' on Weibo, with many Chinese woman commenting how lucky the girl is to have such a romantic partner. However, other corners of the internet have been less enthusiastic. The pictures have divided opinions on the internet, with some seeing the gesture as romantic and others as creepy . Wedding photographer Wan is known for quite dramatic declarations on the topic of love . It is not known how the girlfriend has reacted but many Chinese woman have commented on how 'romantic' the gesture is . Website Kokatu writing that 'A few photos almost border on pedophilia'. However, it should be pointed out that Wan's girlfriend is an adult. Wan is known for somewhat over-dramatic opinions on the topic of love. The wedding photographer often posts his snaps from peoples' ceremonies onto his Weibo profile, saying he doesn't want to miss a moment of people declaring their devotion to one another. He once wrote on the site: 'I always tell my friends that the average lifetime for each person is 631,152 hours, and only 8 hours belongs to your wedding. Every wedding is unique in the world, and don’t miss the most memorable time.' Wan posted the photos with a message saying how he wanted to send a 'love letter to little you' Wan didn't get any other presents for his girlfriend to mark their anniversary. He wrote: 'I am sorry I don¿t have a surprise for you, because I believe staying with you in the past four years is the biggest surprise' Wan is from Zhengzhou, in central China's Henan province . Wan is not the first person to have their overly-romantic gesture poo-pooed by the internet. When one 30-year-old New Yorker who, perhaps sensibly, has remained anonymous broke up with his girlfriend, he decided not to take it lying down. So, at the beginning of last year, ten months after the split he launched a viral campaign, plastering posters all over the city emblazoned with the Nabakov quote 'It was love at first sight, at last sight, at ever ever sight' and even set up a website to help him in his quest. The quote, it turns out, is what he wrote on the woman's noticeboard after their final row. He told a journalist at the time 'It is both an apology and a gesture to show her how much she actually means to me. I wrote the Nabokov quote on a chalkboard in her kitchen when we broke up. She's a writer and a reader and a lover of books, and this is an homage to her just as much as it is to the city I love most.' However, another New York based journo wrote at the time: 'I had lots of thoughts! None of them were good! If a guy I had been seeing—and who messed up to a point that we broke up—suddenly took a private in-joke, or something like that, and plastered it all over the city, I'd feel thoroughly creeped out.' Did he win her back? Unknown.","Wedding photographer Wan posted the photos to mark his four year anniversary with his girlfriend .

"Bogus whiplash claims cost every motorist an extra £118 on their annual car insurance bill, it has been revealed. Premiums have risen by 80 per cent since October 2008 due to the rise in people making costly – and often false – whiplash claims, according to a report by insurance company Aviva. The average legal fee for a whiplash claim is £2,500, almost half of which is due to intermediaries, including claims management companies and personal injury lawyers, seeking a cut for themselves. The researchers said that if insurers handled claims directly rather than through these third parties, an estimated £1.5billion could be stripped from UK motor insurance premiums. Costly: Premiums have risen by 80 per cent since October 2008 due to the rise in people making costly and often false whiplash claims, according to a report by insurance company Aviva (file picture) As a result, industry leaders say it should be a legal requirement for personal injury (PI) claimants to contact the ‘at fault’ insurer directly rather than going to intermediaries such as claims management companies and PI lawyers. Aviva estimates that handling claims directly will halve the current cost of dealing with the 600,000 whiplash claims made every year. This reduction alone could lead to premium falls of around £60 a year for the average driver. Dominic Clayden, claims director at Aviva, said: ‘Our figures for average compensation settlements show that dealing with an insurer directly results in at least as much compensation for the claimant and has the advantage of being quicker, meaning their treatment and rehabilitation can start almost immediately. ‘It would also prompt a significant reduction in the costs of the current system which would benefit all UK motorists, who will begin to see a reduction in their premiums.’ There has been a 70 per cent rise in personal injury claims from road accidents in the past six years. The Association of British Insurers believes that more than a quarter of whiplash claims are fake – but an estimated £2billion is paid in compensation every year. Spokesman Malcolm Tarling said: ‘It’s almost the fraud of choice for too many people. ‘While some are genuine, we think many are fraudulent. Pain: There has been a 70 per cent rise in personal injury claims from road accidents in the past six years . ‘The problem is it’s very difficult to establish whether you have whiplash injuries.’ The findings follow reports last month that police forces have received millions of pounds for passing on the details of road accident victims to claims management companies, insurers and lawyers. This may have led to thousands of people being pursued by ‘cash for crash’ companies looking to profit out of personal injury claims, fuelling the rise in third party involvement. Aviva’s report, called ‘Road to Reform: Reducing Motor Premiums by Reforming the Personal Injury Claims Process’, has been launched ahead of the Ministry of Justice Whiplash Consultation, which will close on March 8. The study found that 63 per cent  of the 2,000 drivers surveyed think that people seek compensation to get money to spend on whatever  they choose rather than for rehabilitation. Research: Only a third of people who made an injury claim spent their compensation on medical treatment or physiotherapy according to Aviva . Previous research by Aviva found that only a third of people who made an injury claim spent their compensation on medical treatment or physiotherapy, while a third said it was used to pay off household debt, 12 per cent to buy luxury items such as TVs and 9 per cent to go on holiday. More than 50 per cent of those surveyed supported the introduction of an independent panel of medical experts to assess whiplash cases. Research also revealed 95 per cent of people believe unnecessary claims are behind premium increases, with 93 per cent naming the rise in whiplash claims specifically. The average cost of car insurance reached £1,000 for the first time in July last year, according to the AA – more than double that of the price of a typical policy four years ago.","The average legal fee for a whiplash claim is £2,500 according to Aviva .

"Argentine protestors demanding the return of the Falkland Islands are planning to disrupt Prince Harry's visit to Brazil later this week, the leader of the Argentine community in the country warned today. Oswaldo Sicardi, the president of Clube Argentino in Rio de Janeiro said the prince's three day visit to the country was 'in extremely bad taste' just weeks before the 30th anniversary of the start of the Falklands War. He called on Argentinians living in the city to 'show their anger' over the islands they call Las Malvinas by picketing the high profile visit. Trouble before he arrives: Prince Harry, will arrive in Rio on Friday on a two-day diplomatic offensive - he is currently in the Central American state of Belize, as part of a Diamond Jubilee Tour of the Caribbean and Brazil . Prince Harry, 27, will arrive in Rio on Friday on a two-day diplomatic offensive designed to improve Britain's links with Latin American countries. He is currently in the Central American state of Belize, as part of a Diamond Jubilee Tour of the Caribbean and Brazil. His first public appearance will be at an event on Rio's world-famous Sugarloaf Mountain, billed as an opportunity to showcase all that is great about Britain. Mr Sicardi said: 'I consider the arrival of Prince Harry, straight after the military exercises in the Malvinas an extremely unfortunate decision and one taken in extremely bad taste. 'Harry can come to Brazil any time he likes if the motive is to celebrate the Queen's Jubilee, raise the profile of his charity or to further business links. 'But he is clearly coming with an ulterior motive, to try to change Brazil's position in relation to the Malvinas. 'I consider it yet another act of provocation by Britain, along with deploying Prince William, sending nuclear submarines and its most powerful warship. Argentinians would be right to show their anger and bring this to the world's attention. War of words: In January Argentines branded Prince William a 'conqueror' after his six-week deployment to the Falkland Islands, despite serving with an RAF Search and Rescue squadron rather than an armed unit . Mr Sircardi, who represents over 60 Argentine families living in Rio, refused to say if a protest was planned. But he said: 'Let's just say that there may be groups of people who might cause some confusion in different places along Harry's way.' He added: 'I would also call on Brazilian ministers to make their own protests if Harry brings up the subject of the Malvinas. It would be a huge error to try try to use the visit to change the position Brazil has clearly defined in a democratic way. Tension: President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner . and David Cameron have engaged in a diplomatic war of words over the sovereignty of the islands . 'If he does try to approach the subject I would hope it would cause a big diplomatic storm across Latin America.'

"A bronze statue was unveiled in France today in tribute to the U.S. war hero who inspired the book and award-winning television series 'Band of Brothers'. The unveiling of the Colorado-made statue of Major Dick Winters was one of many events marking the 68th anniversary of D-Day, the Allied operation that paved the way for the end of the war. The 12ft-tall bronze statue in the Normandy village of Sainte-Marie-du-Mont shows Major Winters, played by English actor Damien Lewis in the acclaimed miniseries, with his weapon at the ready. The Colorado-made statue of Pennsylvania native Major Dick Winters, unveiled today . But Major Winters - of Ephrata, Pennsylvania, who died last year aged 92 - only accepted serving as the statue's likeness after monument planners agreed to dedicate it to the memory of all junior U.S. military officers who served that day. 'There were many Dick Winters in this war, and all deserve the bronze and glory of a statue,' said former Pennsylvania governor Tom Ridge, present as the bronze statue, draped in a camouflage parachute, was unveiled. Also attending were four or five D-Day vets, including two who served in the major's 'Easy Company,' Al Mampre and Herb Suerth Junior. Major Winters 'was a humble, simple person thrust into a position of leadership in which he excelled,' said Mr Suerth, who heads the association of former Easy Company vets, only 19 of whom survive. The statue was made near Boulder, Colorado, and transported here, to a roadside between the village of Sainte-Marie-du-Mont and Utah Beach, distant but visible behind the statue. It was here that Winters and his small band of men dropped out of the sky soon after midnight on June 6, 1944, on a death-defying mission to destroy four German 105mm artillery guns that threatened the Allied invasion force.

Francois Hollande also become the first French President in history to visit the graves of thousands of British soldiers who died liberating his country on D-Day. He paid a visit to the Ranville Cemetery which contains the graves of 2564 British soldiers, many of whom were members of the 6th Airborne Division who died in the early hours of June 6th 1944 after landing by glider and parachute.

Mr Hollande’s decision to place a commemorative wreath in the village near Caen, Normandy, will help lay to rest past accusations that the French have underplayed the British contribution to victory in World War Two. As rain poured down at the end of his visit, Mr Hollande smiled broadly and said: ‘The rain doesn’t matter, being here does.’ He shook hands with Parachute Regiment veterans, as well as serving British and French Army soldiers. In previous years, French D-Day commemorations have concentrated on American invasion beaches, and on the sacrifice of Free French and Resistance forces.

'Their airborne division was responsible for the first liberation of a town on D-Day, and that’s why Mr Hollande wanted to be in Ranville to pay tribute.' Mr Hollande was joined in Ranville by Britain’s Defence Secretary, Philip Hammond, and the pair attended a commemorative service and laid wreaths.

An assault group made up of men from the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry landed in six gliders, earning themselves a place in military folklore which was immortalised in the classic war film The Longest Day. Following liberation, the Ranville churchyard was immediately used to bury those who were killed, before an official cemetery was opened next to it after the war. Jean-Luc Adelaide, the mayor of Ranville, said that French president Vincent Auriol had visited nearby Benouville in 1948, but that no head of state had ever visited the cemetery at Ranville, either on D-Day or on any other day.

There was controversy in 2009 when, on the 65th anniversary of D-Day, Buckingham Palace said there would be no members of the Royal Family at commemorations because they had not been invited by the French. Instead, the then president Nicolas Sarkozy took part in commemorations at the U.S. Omaha Beach. French President Francois Hollande  shakes hands with people next to the war cemetery .

Admiral Christian Brac de la Perriere, the president of the Committee of the Landings, the official French body for commemorating D-Day, welcomed Mr Hollande’s presence at Ranville. He said it would be a ‘major spotlight two years before the 70th anniversary of the landings which we are due set to commemorate in 2014.’ The D-Day landings and the subsequent Battle of Normandy opened the road to Paris for the Allies and signaled the beginning of the end of the four year Nazi occupation of France.

The Prime Minister echoed the words of Winston Churchill as he paid tribute to the 379 innocent Indians slaughtered in the Amritsar massacre. Mr Cameron concluded his visit to India yesterday with a trip to the Golden Temple, the holiest site for Sikhs, and the Jallianwala Bagh gardens – where soldiers under Brigadier Reginald Dyer fired 1,650 shots into a crowd of 20,000 unarmed protesters in 1919.

The visit to Amritsar – the first by a . sitting prime minister – was also an attempt to drum up votes from . Britain’s 800,000-strong Sikh community. Before visiting the massacre site, Mr Cameron toured the Golden temple. The . Amritsar massacre is considered one of the low points in the history of . the Empire - and it also helped to end British rule in India. Tens . of thousands of Indians gathered in a square near the city's iconic . Golden Temple on April 13, 1919 and started protesting against the power . of the Raj. The . protest was part of the growing independence movement, with strikes and . demonstrations sweeping the country in the preceding months. It . was this revolutionary background which made Bridgadier-General . Reginald Dyer nervous about the protest, and which motivated his . decision to order dozens of soldiers to open fire on the demonstrators. The . troops, most of whom were themselves Indian, fired indiscriminately and . without warning, killing hundreds - the official death toll was 379, . but Indians claim that around 1,000 protesters died. Dyer . had intended to suppress calls for independence, but instead the . massacre ended up boosting them as previously pacific Indians rallied to . the cause after hearing of the horrific slaughter. Reactions . in Britain were mixed, but many - including Winston Churchill, then . Secretary of State for War - were revolted by the killing. One . man particularly inspired by the news was Mahatma Gandhi, who soon . began a campaign of non-violence protest which would eventually lead to . the country's independence in 1947. He removed his shoes and socks and put on a blue bandana for his tour. He was shown the kitchens, which feed many of the 100,000 pilgrims who visit the temple every day. He posed for pictures with temple . officials and tried his hand flipping chapatis, before visiting the . inner sanctum in the temple complex. He described it as ‘very moving, very serene and very spiritual’. ‘In coming here to Amritsar, we . should also celebrate the immense contribution that people from the . Punjab play in Britain, the role they play, what they give to our . country,’ Mr Cameron added.

"A breakthrough in translation technology could one day enable you to converse in Chinese without ever actually learning the language. The new technology uses deep neural networks to take the accuracy and speed of language translation far beyond what was previously thought possible. A video posted on YouTube yesterday shows Rick Rashid, head of Microsoft Research, explaining improvements made to machine understanding of English words, with his talk automatically transcribed as he speaks. Machine translation: Rick Rashid, the head of Microsoft Research, showcases the software giant's instantaneous translation software at Microsoft Research Asia's 21st Century Computing in China . But it is when he activates audio translation that the technology becomes really impressive, as it speaks to his audience in Mandarin - using Mr Rashid's own voice. Mr Rashid presented the amazing new technology in Tianjin, China, at Microsoft Research Asia's 21st Century Computing event last month. Although research into computer speech recognition has been underway for the past 60 years, until recently even the best systems had word error rates of between 20 and 25 per cent. However, working in collaboration with the University of Toronto, researchers had Microsoft two years ago made a breakthrough. Using a technique called Deep Neural Networks, in which machines learning is patterned after human brain behaviour, researchers were able to train their software to understand speech better than ever . 'During my October 25 presentation in China, I had the opportunity to showcase the latest results of this work,' Mr Rashid said in a Microsoft TechNet blog post. 'We have been able to reduce the word error rate for speech by over 30 per cent compared to previous methods. This means that rather than having one word in 4 or 5 incorrect, now the error rate is one word in 7 or 8.' He added that this was the biggest breakthrough in the accuracy of computer speech recognition in more than 30 years. Amazing: The technology uses a technique called . Deep Neural Networks, in which machines learning is patterned after . human brain behaviour, to make more accurate translations than have been possible before . Mr Rashid explained that the new technology works via a two step process. First the software recognises the English words he is saying and finds the equivalent in Chinese, which he says is the 'easy part'. Then it gets to grips with the rather more difficult task of reordering the words to fit the syntax of Mandarin Chinese, without which the translation would be a incomprehensible string of seemingly random words. 'Most significantly,' Mr Rashid added, 'we have attained an important goal by enabling an English speaker like me to present in Chinese in his or her own voice, which is what I demonstrated in China. 'It required a text to speech system that Microsoft researchers built using a few hours speech of a native Chinese speaker and properties of my own voice taken from about one hour of pre-recorded (English) data.' 'Though it was a limited test, the effect was dramatic, and the audience came alive in response. 'When I spoke in English, the system automatically combined all the underlying technologies to deliver a robust speech to speech experience—my voice speaking Chinese.'","Use of deep neural networks allows better translation than ever before .

Carter has turned to online site Kickstarter to fund the project, and has already almost tripled his original aim, raising $28,000 dollars. 'Most people wear socks every day, all day, but continue to buy flimsy products, said Cameron on the firm's web site. 'Break the cycle! Your socks should be as sophisticated as you are.' The sock is made primarily made from fabric with built in lycra. The Kevlar sections are carbon . threaded around the toe and heel areas where wear and tear is greatest. The Socrates have kevlar fibres, usually found in bulletproof vests, sewn into the sole, toes and heel. The firm is selling the socks online for $25 for two pairs, or $65 for three, and says they will be shipped five weeks after the Kickstarter funding closes later this month. The product has already become a huge success, with over 700 people having signed up. Once production has begun, the firm is also planning to expand with women's socks and different designs. The Socrates appear to be normal such - the their inventor claims they will last forever.","Heels, toes and sole contain Kevlar - usually found in bulletproof vests ."
"A teenager has spoken of her misery after her puppy was shot by police officers who claimed they were unable to restrain it during a raid. Shannon-Marie Henery, 17, had left the dog, Blaze, at a house when she moved into temporary accommodation where her pet was not allowed to live. Weeks later the dog was killed after a specialist response unit raided the house in New Addington, near Croydon, South London, searching for a teenage male suspected of burglary. Shannon-Marie Henery was devastated after police shot and killed her puppy during a South London raid . Blaze was staying at another house away from Shannon-Marie in New Addington, near Croydon, when he was killed . When they were unable to control the animal during the raid on Tuesday, officers from the Metropolitan Police called in armed back-up. Shannon-Marie said: ‘I can’t believe the police have shot my puppy. He was a playful, loving puppy. He was my world. ‘The only time he showed aggression was if someone knocks at the door or he hears a loud noise and he barks because he protects his home.’ She said that her pet died ‘for no good reason’. ‘This is wrong, I’m taking things further,’ she said. ‘There was no dead bodies, weapons, drugs in the house.’ Shannon-Marie said the French mastiff and pit bull terrier cross was her best friend from the day she got him, at just nine weeks old. When they were unable to control the animal, officers from the Met Police called in armed back-up . Shannon-Marie said: 'I can't believe the police have shot my puppy. He was a playful, loving puppy. He was my world' She said: ‘I suffer badly from anxiety, and I got Blaze to help me cope. I felt safe when I took him out. He was my hero and my best friend. ‘I can’t believe that he’s gone. He wouldn’t hurt a fly. I want answers, what they did has to be answered for.’ Blaze was at another house because the college student is temporarily staying with a relative while she tries to find somewhere permanent. She added: ‘Blaze isn’t vicious at all. If the police said he barked at them, I’m not surprised. I’m sure any dog would bark if police burst into their house. ‘They can’t bring my dog back, but I need to know what happened, and why they couldn’t have just left him alone. ‘Blaze was my friend and now I’ll never see him again.’ She said: 'I suffer badly from anxiety, and I got Blaze to help me cope... He was my hero and my best friend' She said there was ‘no need’ for the shooting and vowed to find out why it was carried out. ‘Someone needs to pay for this. How could they shoot my defenceless puppy?’ A Metropolitan Police spokesperson said: ‘Officers attended an address in Windham Avenue, New Addington, on January 23 to carry out an arrest enquiry for a 17-year-old boy wanted in connection with aggravated burglary and robbery offences. ‘Police forced entry to the address and the 17-year-old suspect was located and arrested at the scene and he currently remains in police custody at a South London police station. A dog was also present at the address, and was acting aggressively towards officers. ‘A specialist police dog unit attended, but were unable to safely restrain the dog. Armed officers were subsequently called and the dog was shot and killed. We believe the dog may be pit bull-type breed.’","Shannon-Marie Henery, 17, left Blaze at a house in South London .

"Mia Farrow has continued her attacks on her ex Woody Allen in light of his Golden Globes tribute by bringing up the claims of sexual assault that one of her adopted daughters made against the famed director. She posted a loaded question to her more than 370,000 Twitter followers on Monday, asking them to decide if Allen was a pedophile for what he did to her daughter Dylan in 1992. The Twitter outrage came after Allen's former lover and muse Diane Keaton made a gushing tribute to the director at last night's Golden Globes where he was honored with the prestigious Cecil B. DeMille award. While Keaton was praising the 'complicated' female roles that Allen writes for women, his estranged son Ronan Farrow and ex Mia took the opportunity to remind the world about the filmmaker's past history of alleged sexual assault. Scroll down for video . Lashing out: Ronan and Mia Farrow, pictured in May 2012, slammed Woody Allen on Twitter on Sunday and his mother continued the fight on Monday . Strong words: Woody's son and ex-girlfriend weren't happy about him receiving an honour at the Golden Globes . Continuing the story: Farrow promoted the Vanity Fair story as a way to show her side . Allen and Mia Farrow had a . relationship for more than a decade, but that ended when she found out . that he was having sex with her adopted daughter Soon-Yi. Her discovery . of naked pictures that the director had taken of the then-teenage girl . were coupled with sexual assault allegations made by her 7-year-old . daughter Dylan- who she had adopted with Allen. Diane Keaton accepted Woody Allen's Cecil B. DeMille award on his behalf at Sunday night's Golden Globes, and dedicated a large part of her glowing speech to the roles that he writes for women. ‘It's kind of hard for . me to wrap my mind around the fact that 179 of the world's most . captivating actresses have appeared in Woody's films and there's a . reason for this. The reason is they wanted to,' she said at the ceremony. ‘They wanted to because Woody's women . can't be compartmentalised, right? I mean, they struggle, they love, . they fall apart, they dominate, they're funny, they're flawed. They are, . in fact, the hallmark of Woody's work. Allen was noticeably absent from the affair but that came as little surprise since he has made a point to never attend award ceremonies throughout his career. Keaton, 68, ended the speech by bizarrely singing the Girl Scouts anthem. Keaton and Allen dated in the 1970s and she starred in eight of his films including Annie Hall. Dylan's . case was never tried and charges were dropped against Allen, but they . were heard in the custody hearings between Farrow and Allen, and on . Sunday night, Ronan made sure that the world did not forget the charges . either. ‘Missed the Woody Allen tribute - did . they put the part where a woman publicly confirmed he molested her at . age 7 before or after Annie Hall?’ he tweeted. Mia, who is also active on Twitter, made her dig slightly less pointed but direct all the same. The Rosemary’s Baby star had been . live tweeting the ceremony, but made it clear that as soon as Woody’s . tribute was about to begin, she was switching off. ‘Time to grab some icecream & switch over to #GIRLS,’ she wrote, followed by a simple: ‘Nite all.’ [sic] . Allen has long denied the claims made by Dylan- as she said that he sexually assaulted her in the attic of Farrow's Connecticut home in 1992. The judge dropped the case in 1993 to avoid the trauma of Dylan having to appear in court but said he had ‘probable cause’ to prosecute him on sexual molestation charges. Mia, now 68, and Woody, 78, separated . after the actress discovered the director was having a sexual . relationship with her adopted daughter Soon-Yi, who he is now married . to and they now have children of their own. Ronan has cut off all communication from Allen and Dylan has done the same but to an even greater degree. Speaking publicly for the first time in years, Dylan- who has since changed her name- told Vanity Fair that . Allen tried contacting her twice after the court-ordered no-contact . issuance ended when she turned 18-years-old. Both times, Dylan had a . visceral reaction to her father's letters. The Vanity Fair article- which also . included Mia's suggestion that her ex-husband Frank Sinatra may have . actually been Ronan's biological father- was published in November and . written by Maureen Orth. Ms . Orth's son, Luke Russert, is Ronan's colleague at MSNBC and after . Russert tweeted a link to the story during the Golden Globes, Mia . retweeted it. Outrage: Farrow continued to tweet about her daughter's allegations of sexual abuse on Monday . Back in the day: Mia and Woody (seen here in 1988, Mia holding Ronan and Woody holding Dylan) were together for more than a decade before they split amid allegations that he sexually assaulted Dylan when she was 7-years-old . Complicated: Mia Farrow adopted Soon-Yi (seen together in 1991) with her second husband Andre Previn but then went on to raise her with her later partner Woody Allen, who she split with when his sexual relationship with Soon-Yi was discovered. Soon-Yi and Woody stayed together and are now married (seen in September) Mia then . posted her own link to the story this morning, asking her more than . 370,000 followers to decide for themselves whether or not Allen is a . pedophile. Sunday . night's tweet was not the first time that Ronan has bad-mouthed his . father, slamming his relationship with Soon-Yi on Father's day in 2012. 'Happy father’s day — or as they call it in my family, happy brother-in-law’s day,' Ronan wrote at the time. While his former family members may have . been critical of their estranged father and partner, the stars in the . room at the Golden Globes ceremony were filled with praise, as Diane . Keaton accepted the Cecil B. Demille award on Allen's behalf. The lifetime achievement award was voted on by members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association and has previously been awarded to Jodie Foster, Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg among many others. Diane, 68, starred in Annie Hall, as well as seven other of Woody’s films, while 25-year-old Emma will be starring in his next project, Magic In The Moonlight. Diane, even bizarrely sang a little song, and swore during the speech, said: ‘I think it's safe to say that Woody Allen is an anomaly. ‘He's made 74 movies in 48 years. He's directed them, he's starred in them, he's produced them and, of course, he's written them. He's written all of them, every one.’ Special honor: Diane Keaton (L) and Emma Stone accepted the Cecil B. DeMille award on Woody's behalf . ‘They wanted to because Woody's women can't be compartmentalised, right? I mean, they struggle, they love, they fall apart, they dominate, they're funny, they're flawed. They are, in fact, the hallmark of Woody's work. ‘But what's even more remarkable is that absolutely nothing links these unforgettable characters from the fact that they came from the mind of Woody Allen. And there you have it.’ The end of Diane’s speech got cut off because she said how Allen would have been thinking 'get the hook and get her off the God damn stage' but overzealous censors bleeped out a longer portion of her speech.","Woody Allen was accused of sexually assaulting his 7-year-old daughter that he raised with then-partner Mia Farrow in the early 1990s .

"Bad blood between Manchester City and CSKA Moscow has spilled over into the dressing room after it emerged the controversial Russian club didn’t even feed Manuel Pellegrini’s players after last month’s game in Eastern Europe. City and Wednesday’s opponents Moscow have been at loggerheads since last season’s Champions League fixtures when the Barclays Premier League champions complained that midfielder Yaya Toure had been racially abused. Last month’s 2-2 draw at Arena Khimki was played behind closed doors as a result of UEFA-imposed punishment for that incident and others, although City subsequently complained that local fans had gained access by buying sponsors' tickets on the black market. Manchester City drew 2-2 in Moscow, with Sergio Aguero scoring the opening goal, but CSKA failed to provide Manuel Pellegrini's men with adequate levels of food after the match as the fued between the sides grows . Yaya Toure was a victim of racist chanting when City played CSKA Moscow in last season's competition . City fans held up banners during last season's match at the Etihad showing anger at racism in Moscow . Now it has emerged that CSKA took the petty feuding to new levels last time by refusing to provide anything substantial for City’s players to eat in the visitors’ dressing room two weeks ago. It is customary in football for the home club to provide hot food high in carbohydrate for both sets of players to snack on after a game to help them replace lost energy. This is particularly important in European games when teams often have long plane journeys home immediately after matches. In the modern age, clubs at this high level usually provide a range of food including pizza, pasta, muffins and doughnuts. CSKA, however, laid on only a few bits of fruit for City to eat, leaving Pellegrini and his players in a rage as they left the stadium. Last month's clash in Russia was played behind closed doors as punishment for CSKA's indiscretions . City and CSKA players stand with a 'No to racism' banner before the 2-2 draw in Moscow last month . Moscow players celebrate after scoring from the penalty spot against City last month . On Wednesday at the Etihad Stadium it is understood that City will not sink to CSKA’s level by retaliating in kind but Pellegrini’s players are sure to use it as motivation as they head in to a game they really must win if they are to have any chance of reaching the last eight. The atmosphere in the City boardroom is also bound to be less than cordial at the Etihad after recent incidents between the clubs. Last season CSKA’s top-ranking officials responded to City’s complaint about racism by turning up to an official reception before the subsequent game in Manchester wearing jeans, trainers and T-shirts. Usual custom would have seen both sets of directors in shirt and tie. CSKA Moscow fans were punished for hooliganism and racism but the club were not happy with it . CSKA were forced to hold matches behind closed door due to persistent hooliganism and racist abuse . City players celebrating after scoring their second goal in Moscow during last month's 2-2 draw . Last month, meanwhile, only one of City’s top brass - sporting director Txiki Begiristain - actually bothered to go the CSKA game. The next highest-ranking official on the trip was ambassador Mike Summerbee as the likes of chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak and chief executive Ferran Soriano stayed at home. Since then the clubs have been in dispute again, with City complaining about the 300 fans they believe infiltrated the game at Khimki. Like MailOnline Sport's Facebook page.

"A woman’s good looks are more important than policies to help her get ahead in politics, a psychological study has found. The research suggests that women with more feminine faces tend to do better at the ballot box, especially in more conservative areas. The U.S. scientists say their results do not mean a supermodel is guaranteed political success - she would still need to be perceived as being politically competent. But they found that a woman’s looks do have a profound impact on voters. A woman's good looks are more important than policies to help her get ahead in politics, a psychological study has found and the effect is most pronounced in conservative areas. However, the woman still needs to be perceived a politically competent. Labour politician Caroline Flint is pictured . Altering search results has a major effect on the voting preferences of undecided voters and could swing a close election, researchers have claimed. Researchers analysing an Indian election found undecided voters paid far more attention to search rankings than previously thought. Studies show that the higher the rank, the more people trust the result, so experts at the American Institute for Behavioural Research and Technology in California explored if the effect was similar for political candidates. They discovered that altering search rankings so they were biased in favour of a candidate could push the preferences of undecided voters toward that candidate by 15% or more. The team carried out a new study in recent weeks with more than 2,000 undecided voters throughout India. The researchers have shown that votes in India can easily be pushed toward one candidate or another by about 12 per cent - double that amount in some demographic groups - enough to determine the outcomes of many close races. The researchers, from Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, suggest the shape of a face plays a key role in influencing voting behaviour. The key, they say, is how voters read so-called ‘gender cues’ - how feminine or masculine someone looks. The attribute is influenced by the shape of the eyes, cheekbones, jawlines and brow, as well as the length of hair and application of makeup. Previous research has shown that faces with atypical gender cues – women with masculine features and men with feminine features – cause initial uncertainty when people try to categorise them. The new study demonstrated for the first time that gender cues uniquely predict female politicians’ electoral success above and beyond competence, suggesting a discrepancy between traits used to evaluate male and female politicians. In the experiment, a female politician's success was related to how feminine or masculine her face was perceived less than one half-second after its initial exposure, suggesting that the way a face's gender is rapidly processed may translate into votes at the ballot box (pictured) Professor Jon Freeman, director of the social cognitive and neural sciences lab at Dartmouth, said: ‘Individuals are highly sensitive to gendered facial cues, and these cues are processed within only milliseconds after seeing another’s face. ‘It’s important to examine how facial cues could inadvertently affect female politicians’ electoral success, especially given the possibility of a female U.S. president in the near future and the rising number of women in Congress.’ The study, published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science, used software to track the computer mouse movements of 300 participants who were shown politicians’ faces. They were asked to categorise them as male or female. The new study demonstrated for the first time that gender cues uniquely predict female politicians' electoral success above and beyond competence, suggesting a discrepancy between traits used to evaluate male and female politicians. Hilary Clinton is pictured . The results showed that the more that participants were drawn to select the male response when categorising the gender of a female politician’s face, the less likely she was to have been successful in elections.  The lab participants also indicated they would be less likely to vote for such politicians. Professor Freeman said: ‘We show that subtle uncertainty during the initial processing of a face’s gender predicts the electoral success or failure of female politicians, and this is a unique effect not explained by perceived competence or attractiveness. ‘A female politician’s success was related to how feminine or masculine her face was perceived less than one half-second after its initial exposure, suggesting that the way a face’s gender is rapidly processed may translate into real-world political outcomes.’ The effect was more pronounced as the conservatism of the constituency increased, which supports previous research indicating that conservatives may be less tolerant of uncertainty.","Scientists from Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, suggest the shape of a woman's face plays a key role in influencing voting behaviour .

"Whistleblower: Gary Walker, former chief executive for United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS trust, has defied a legal gag to speak out against NHS management . An NHS whistleblower said he faced ruin for telling the truth about patient safety. Gary Walker was paid £500,000 to keep quiet after he was removed as chief executive of the United Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust. But this week he broke his silence about a care scandal that may have cost the lives of 670 patients. In doing so Mr Walker ignored an email from NHS-funded lawyers ordering him to respect the terms of the gagging order in 2011. Senior MP Stephen Dorrell today called . on the Department of Health to ensure no action was taken by an NHS . trust against Mr Walker because he broke the gagging order to speak out . about his patient safety concerns. Warning phone calls followed the letter when it became clear he planned to tell BBC Radio 4’s Today programme about his ordeal. He was told: ‘Should you breach the term relating to confidentiality, you will immediately repay to the trust, on demand, all sums paid under this agreement in full.’ Refusing to be cowed, Mr Walker gave interviews to the BBC and the Daily Mail. In them, he attacked both the current head of the NHS, Sir David Nicholson, and one of his key sidekicks, Dame Barbara Hakin. Mr Walker said Sir David, who faced calls to quit last week for his failure to stop the scandal of high death rates at Stafford Hospital, had been warned about problems in Lincolnshire in 2009 but was ‘not interested in patient safety’. Instead, Mr Walker claims, he ordered that whistleblowers on the trust’s board who had raised concerns should be sacked. He also accused Dame Barbara of halting a review into worrying high mortality rates at the trust. Staff were also told ‘targets must be met regardless of demand’. Mr Walker, a father of two, said: ‘I stand to lose everything if they sue. I only signed the order because my legal fees had reached £100,000 and I was about to lose my house. ‘Now, I risk having to repay even more than the settlement because I could be liable for the trust’s legal fees. I face ruin. ‘But if it’s got to the stage where thousands and thousands of patients are dying needlessly in NHS hospitals and the Government says no one’s to blame, someone needs to stand up and be counted. 'If they want to fight me in the courts for breach of an unlawful contract I was forced to sign, then I will fight them all the way. Boss: Sir David Nicholson (left) has refused to step down following the scandal. Dame Barbara Hakin (right) allegedly halted a review into high mortality rates at the trust . Gary Walker was paid £500,000 to keep quiet after he was removed as chief executive of the United Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust . 'I cannot believe that any reasonable person that believes in transparency would seek to silence matters that are so clearly in the public interest.’ Mr Walker won strong backing from the Commons health select committee on Wednesday night. Stephen Dorrell, its Tory chairman, said he would invite Mr Walker to give evidence to the cross party group of MPs to ‘set out in detail his concerns’. Mr Dorrell, the chairman of the House of Commons Health Committee, condemned the attempt to gag Mr Walker and said the committee believed such clauses were ‘probably unenforceable’, ‘not acceptable in the NHS’ and ‘against the public interest’. In a letter to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt last night, he urged him to stop the trust from . taking any action which would prevent Mr Walker giving evidence to the . committee about the reasons for his dismissal. Take no action: Senior MP Stephen Dorrell urged the health department not to stop Mr Walker giving evidence about the reasons for his dismissal . He said: ‘We were concerned and disappointed to hear that Mr Walker had received a lawyers’ letter which he has interpreted as reinforcing the constraints upon him under the terms of the gagging clause in his compromise agreement.’ Former health secretary Mr Dorrell today said it was not 'legitimate' for gagging clauses to be used to shut down discussion of issues of patient safety. He called on Mr Hunt to follow the recommendation of the Francis Report into the Mid-Staffordshire scandal for a ban on the use of the orders to prevent whistle-blowing. Mr Dorrell told Today: 'The key question for the Secretary of State now is whether he is prepared to precipitate the kind of culture change which Robert Francis said is core to improving the culture in the NHS.' Mr Dorrell said he accepted that confidentiality agreements were often required as part of agreements on the termination of employment. But he added: 'Where there is a legitimate public concern, in particular about patient safety issues, these are not legitimate issues to be covered by confidentiality agreements.' Asked whether Mr Hunt should take on trusts over the issue of gagging clauses, Mr Dorrell replied: 'Absolutely. One of the things that are wrong about the culture is that we have a debate in the Today programme studio about something that ought to be routine business in the management of every public health provider. We are talking about how public money is spent and how patient safety is safeguarded.' In his letter to the Health Secretary, Mr Dorrell said: 'The committee intends to write to Mr Walker to invite him to set out in detail the nature of the concerns which lay behind the breakdown of his relationship with the Lincolnshire trust. 'Before doing so, however, I would be grateful if you would confirm that neither the trust nor any other NHS body will seek to enforce any clause in Mr Walker's compromise agreement which would impinge on his capacity to respond fully to the committee's request.' Mr Dorrell said he and the committee want reassurances that ‘neither the trust nor any other NHS body will seek to enforce any clause in Mr Walker’s compromise agreement which would impinge on his capacity to respond fully’ to the MPs’ request for him to give evidence. The Lincolnshire trust is one of 14 under investigation over high death rates. Mr Walker added: ‘I lost my career, my partner of six years and most of my assets challenging my dismissal. But I would not lose my integrity. ‘I settled because my relationship was falling apart, because of the stress, because my children were affected and because I was in arrears on my mortgage and was facing repossession. ‘I could not continue fighting against an NHS with bottomless pockets. I spent £100,000 on legal fees because they dragged it out for so long.’ Robert Francis QC, who led the inquiry into Stafford Hospital, says the true extent of the care failures will probably never be known . He said he had been suspended by the trust for five months without being told what he was charged with prior to his sacking in February 2010. Mr Walker said he had been forced to take anti-depressants and tranquillisers over that period because he was unable to sleep. Letters also emerged yesterday from doctors and staff at the trust warning that they were being ‘coerced’ into treating patients in an unsafe environment and were endangering their safety. According to documents, Sir David agreed in 2009 that ‘changes be made’ to the leadership of the trust after the board blew the whistle on the state of their hospitals. A month later, charges of misconduct were filed against Mr Walker, who was forced out of his job in 2010 and made to sign the gagging agreement the following year. Mr Walker’s decision to speak out means he is effectively blacklisted within the NHS and will not be able to get another job. Hospital managers will be unwilling to hire him in case he speaks publicly about standards of care. Meanwhile the dozens of nurses and doctors implicated in the horrific neglect at Mid Staffordshire have been allowed to keep their jobs. East Midlands Strategic Health Authority said it 'utterly refuted' Mr Walker's claims and acted at all times 'in the interest of patients'.","Gary Walker was paid £500,000 hush money when he left his hospital trust .

"Hundreds of red, white and blue LED modules are illuminating lower Manhattan as officials tested the lights atop One World Trade Center for the first time on Friday night. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said that the beacon is packed with nearly 300 lights and their glow can be seen for up to 50 miles. But the skyscraper faces a tense wait as a committee of building . experts met Friday to judge whether a design change that . affects the 408-foot needle disqualifies it from being counted as the . nation's tallest tower. Onward and upward: One World Trade Center towers above all other buildings in Manhattan's Financial District and has now been declared the tallest building in the U.S. From miles away: The beacon and spire of One World Trade Center are lit up, as seen from The Heights neighborhood of Jersey City . New look: The spire of 1 World Trade Center was lit up for the first time on last Friday . The group will announce its decision . next week and One World Trade Center faces some stiff competition from the Willis Tower in Chicago - coincidentally the city where the committee is based. Rising from the ashes of 9/11, the new World Trade Center tower has punched above the New York skyline to reach its powerfully symbolic height of 1,776 feet and become the tallest building in the country. Or has it? The committee of architects recognized as the arbiters on world building heights met to decide whether the tower in the Big Apple or the Windy City is the loftiest. But there's more than bragging rights at stake; One World Trade Center stands as a monument to those killed in the terrorist attacks, and the ruling could dim the echo of America's founding year in the structure's height. Without the needle, the building measures 1,368 feet. Tallest towers: Willis Tower, formerly known as the Sears Tower, in Chicago on March 12, 2008 (left) and One World Trade Center in New York on September 5, 2013 (right) Topping out: The 104-floor One World Trade beats out 110-floor Willis Tower - now that its spire is deemed admissible . What's more, the decision is being made by an organization based in Chicago, whose cultural and architectural history is embodied by the Willis - formerly Sears - Tower that would be knocked into second place by a vote in favor of the New York structure. 'Most of the time these decisions are not so controversial,' said Daniel Safarik, an architect and spokesman for the nonprofit Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat. The 30 members of its Height Committee are meeting to render a judgment behind closed doors in Chicago, where the world's first skyscraper appeared in 1884. The committee, comprising industry professionals from all over the world, will announce its decision next week. Colorful: The new World Trade Center tower has punched above the New . York skyline to reach its powerfully symbolic height of 1,776 feet and . become the tallest building in the country. Or has it? To the point: A committee of architects recognized as the arbiters on world building heights is meeting in Chicago to decide whether a design change affecting One World Trade Center's needle disqualifies its hundreds of feet from being counted . The question over One World Trade Center, which remains under construction and is expected to open next year, arose because of a change to the design of its tower-topping needle. Under the council's current criteria, spires that are an integral part of a building's aesthetic design count; broadcast antennas that can be added and removed do not. The designers of One World Trade Center had intended to enclose the mast's communications gear in decorative cladding made of fiberglass and steel. But the developer removed that exterior shell from the design, saying it would be impossible to properly maintain or repair. Without it, the question is whether the mast is now primarily just a broadcast antenna. According to the architecture firm behind the building, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill LLP, the needle will have a communications platform for radio and television equipment. Contention: The 110 story, 1,450-foot Willis Tower is in competition with the 104-story, 1,776-foot (including spire) One World Trade Center, a skyscraper built at the site of the 9/11 attacks . Safarik said the committee might consider amending its height criteria during the Friday meeting - a move with much broader implications that could force a reshuffle in the rankings of the tallest buildings in the world. If the matter weren't so steeped in emotion it might have set off some of the good-natured ribbing emblematic of the history of one-upmanship between New York and Chicago. But One World Trade Center is a monument to American resilience admired well beyond Manhattan. 'I don't think anybody's going to argue with the pride in building that new tower,' said 31-year-old software developer Brett Tooley, who works across the street from the Willis Tower. 'Not only is it going to be the tallest building; it's going to be one of the strongest buildings in the history of America. It's a marvel of engineering.' From great heights: Anna Kane, five,  looks down from the glass balcony called The Ledge, suspended 1,353 feet in the air and jutting four feet out from the Willis Tower's 103rd floor Skydeck . 'We take our hats off to them out here in Chicago and the Midwest,' said Robert Wislow, chairman and chief executive of U.S. Equities, the firm that manages the Willis Tower. 'And we welcome the building to the elite club of the tallest buildings in the world. Nobody's looking at this like a competition.' Still, the Willis has a central place in Chicago's history, speaking to the city's own tradition of recovering from adversity ever since the 1871 Great Fire and its history of creating architectural marvels, said Peter Alter, an archivist at the Chicago History Museum. Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, headquartered in Chicago, also designed the Willis, which opened as Sears Tower in 1973 and remained the tallest building in the world until 1996 when the council ruled that the Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, had knocked it from the top spot. And the Willis can still claim to get visitors up higher: The highest occupied floor in the 1,450-foot (not including antenna height), 110-story Willis Tower is still higher up than that of the 104-story One World Trade Center. Rising from the ashes: One World Trade Center, built at the site of the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York . At the Willis' 103rd floor thrill-seekers can step out into one of the glass boxes known as The Ledge that extend outside the building's steel frame and look straight down 1,353 feet. In New York, the debate was upsetting to Jim Riches, a retired fire department deputy chief who lost his 29-year-old firefighter son, Jimmy, in the terrorist attack. 'You know what? I think it's a ridiculous argument. It doesn't matter to me what height it is,' he said. 'You know, my son's not going to walk back in that door again. And that's the big thing. He's gone.'","Spire lit up for the first time on One World Trade Center on Friday night - and it can be seen from up to 50 miles away .

Defender Eliaquim Mangala is available for Wednesday's home clash with CSKA after missing the derby but midfielder Frank Lampard is still sidelined. Former England international Lampard had been hopeful of returning after missing four games with a thigh problem but the weekend trip to QPR looks a more likely target.

There has been plenty of speculation over whether City could seek to extend his stay and even a report that the ex-Chelsea star has already signed a deal until the end of the season. But Pellegrini suggested such reports are premature by reiterating the position both he and Lampard have often spoken of, that no decision has yet been made.

"A teenager has been viciously stabbed to death as he tried to flee a gang of youths. The victim, named locally as Danny O'Shea, was chased and had his throat slashed outside his mother's front door in Newham, east London last night. Paramedics fought for 30 minutes to save the 18-year-old's life, but he was pronounced dead at the scene in front of horrified neighbours at 6.50pm. Killed: Tragic Danny O'Shea was chased for 300 yards and stabbed by a gang before he died outside his mother's front door . Police have yet to establish whether the teen's mother was in at the time when her son was chased 300 yards before the attack outside the house. Tributes have already started pouring in to a memorial group on Facebook, which has attracted over 500 people. Friends of Danny O'Shea today said the 18-year-old 'wouldn't hurt a fly'.Danny's family were said to be too 'devastated' to speak about his death. However a friend, speaking outside the family home, said: 'Danny wouldn't hurt a fly, he was completely harmless. 'His family are devastated.' A large patch of dried blood was still clearly visible opposite the groundfloor flat. A door of a neighbour's home had been taken off for forensic testing and replaced. Tributes: Hundreds have taken to Facebook to pay tribute to Danny O'Shea, who died from stab wounds . Paramedics tried to revive Danny at the scene, but he was pronounced dead shortly after.  There have been no arrests and police are appealing for witnesses to come forward. Piles of flowers covered the drive of the family home, with balloons, a single candle and pictures with tributes including one from his sister reading 'to my darling bro, we love you so much. 'Dan you're one in 1000's millions RIP. Angel forever, love Jessie, Georgie, James, Lauren, Isabella and Phoebe.' A steady stream of family and friends visited the family home, many in tears and some carrying flowers. The teen's grandfather, Michael O'Shea, told The Sunday Mirror: 'He was a wonderful lad. We're all in shock.' A police spokesman said earlier that next of kin had been informed but formal identification had not yet taken place.

"Guilty: Jack McCullough was living in Seattle when new evidence re-opened the case in July 2011 . A former Washington state policeman convicted of kidnapping and murdering a young Illinois girl more than a half century ago was sentenced Monday to life in prison. Jack McCullough, 73, was convicted in September in one of the oldest unsolved crimes in American history and was given the maximum sentence for the 1957 murder. The sentencing took place in Sycamore, the small community where 7-year-old Maria Ridulph was abducted and killed 55 years ago. Like McCullough's trial, it was expected to be emotional for members of Ridulph's and McCullough's families, as well as 63-year-old Kathy Chapman, a childhood friend of Ridulph's who was with her until moments before she was abducted. Judge James Hallock admonished an unrepentant McCullough for turning to face Ridulph's family and friends as he spoke before sentencing. The judge ordered McCullough to face the bench, but McCullough kept pivoting toward the gallery. 'I did not, did not, kill Maria Ridulph,' said McCullough, who grew up in Sycamore. 'It was a crime I did not, would not, could not have done.' He pointed to a box that he said contained 4,000 pages of FBI documents, which his lawyers argued supported McCullough's alibi that he was not in Sycamore the day of the crime. The judge ruled it inadmissible because the people in the documents were dead and could not be cross-examined. Tragic: Maria went missing in 1957 after a man who called himself 'Johnnie' offered to give her a piggy back ride one night and her friend had run home to get mittens . Victory: Kathy Chapman (left) was the childhood friend who was with Maria Ridulph on the day that she was kidnapped . Support: She was joined by Mary Hunt, the murderer's half-sister who testified against him in the trial . McCullough's attorney said that ruling likely will be part of an appeal. Before the sentencing, a prosecutor, . Victor Escarcida, said that McCullough had 'left a lifetime of emotional . wreckage in his wake.' 'Jack McCullough made Sycamore a scary place,' Escarcida said. 'Now there was a true boogeyman living among them. He is the definition of evil.' Prosecutors . contended that on December 3, 1957, a then-17-year-old McCullough, . known then as John Tessier, approached Ridulph and Chapman in front of . Ridulph's house and played with them for a while, offering to give them . piggyback rides. End to the mystery: Pat Quinn and Charles Ridulph, the brother and sister of Maria, answered questions outside the courthouse after the sentence was handed out . Justice: Former DeKalb County State's Attorney Clay Campbell helped prosecute the case . When . Chapman ran home to get her mittens, prosecutors said, McCullough . dragged Maria into an alley and choked her with a wire, then stabbed her . in the throat and chest. Prosecutors . say that he then loaded her body into his car and drove more than 100 . miles to where he disposed of her body in a wooded area. Ridulph's . disappearance drew national attention during a massive, months-long . search before her body was found the following April. President Dwight Eisenhower and FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover reportedly asked for regular updates on the case. Ultimately, members of his own family helped convict him. Accused: Jack McCullough, then 18, went by the . name of John Tessier and lived a block away from Maria Ridulph's family . in Sycamore, Illinois but after his alibi cleared him of involvement he . left and changed his name . Birthday girl: Forensic testing showed that 'Pretty Maria' Ridulph, as she came to be known in the press, was stabbed at least three times in the throat . During the trial, Janet Tessier, . McCullough's half-sister, described McCullough's mother making . incriminating comments about McCullough on her deathbed in 1994. Janet claimed . their mother, Eileen Tessier had told her on her deathbed: 'John did it, . John did it - and you have to tell someone.' She told the court: 'She was very agitated and emotional and she expressed a great deal of guilt.' His . two other half-sisters said McCullough never returned home the night . the seven-year-old girl vanished but their mother told police he had. Katheran Caulfield said she stayed up . until at least 11:30pm on the night the child vanished but never saw . her brother come home. But she claimed her mother told police he had been home that evening. The mother acknowledged that she had lied to police when she supported McCullough's alibi. After the initial 1950s case went cold, Tessier, as he was known then, left the Chicago area, joined the United States Army and changed his name to Jack McCullough. He had told investigators that he was on a train to Chicago to get a medical exam before enlisting in the Air Force, but his then girlfriend later found the Rockford-to-Chicago train ticket from that day that was unused and unstamped. Maria's remains were exhumed from her grave in July 2011 so that modern-day forensic scientists may be able to find DNA evidence to implicate McCullough that could not be detected in 1958. Once a new investigation was launched, . authorities went to Chapman, Ridulph's childhood friend, and showed her . an old photograph if McCullough. A half century later, she identified him as the teenager who came up to them that snowy day and introduced himself as 'Johnny.' McCullough did not testify. Family: Charles Ridulph, the older brother of Maria, outside the DeKalb County Courthouse in Sycamore, after attending Jack McCullough's trial . McCullough was one of more than 100 . people who were briefly suspects, but he had what seemed like a solid . alibi. On the day the girl vanished, he told investigators he'd been . traveling to Chicago for a medical exam before joining the Air Force. Maria's . remains were exhumed from her grave in July 2011 so that modern-day . forensic scientists may be able to find DNA evidence to implicate . McCullough that could not be detected in 1958. Sycamore . police chief Don Thomas explained: 'He matched the description of the . suspect, he wore the same clothing, he had the same first name 'Johnny.' 'We were able recently to totally disallow (McCullough's) alibi with fresh information and new interviews.' McCullough eventually settled in Seattle, working as a Washington state police officer. Maria's murder is not the only atrocity of which the former cop has been accused of committing in the past. Gone: Maria Ridulph's body was exhumed last year in order to find new DNA evidence after McCullough's ex-girlfriend provided new evidence that cast his alibi into doubt . McCullough was indicted on one count . of child sexual assault and four counts of indecent liberties with a . child in October last year according to the Illinois State Police and . the Dekalb County State's Attorney's Office. The victim had told investigators that McCullough raped her when she was 14 in Sycamore, the statement said. A . probable cause statement filed by Seattle police in conjunction with . McCullough's arrest in June said that a runaway teenage girl who met . McCullough - who used to go by the name John Tessier - in the early . 1980s accused him of sexually assaulting her. He was convicted of unlawful . communication over his interaction with the girl and fired from his job . with the police in Milton, Washington, the Seattle statement said. The . former police officer had also been accused of raping one of his . 14-year-old half-sisters 50 years ago before being acquitted after two . key witnesses changed their testimony in court in April this year. The . alleged victim, now 64, gave emotional testimony about being sexually . assaulted by Jack McCullough, now 72, and two friends in 1962 - but in . the end, too much time had passed.","Maria Ridulph, 7, was killed in December 1957 after a teenage boy named 'Johnny' offered to give her a piggyback ride .

"Halloween may have been last Friday but Liverpool could be in for another fright night when they take on Real Madrid in the Bernabeu. The stuttering Reds, who have not looked themselves in either the Premier League or the Champions League this season, will come up against Europe's most feared and in-form forward line in the Spanish capital. Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale, James Rodriguez, Karim Benzema, Toni Kroos, Luka Modric - facing Real Madrid is like opening the gates of Hell at the moment and all those torments are expected to feature on Tuesday night. Brendan Rodgers faces another difficult evening as Liverpool take on Real Madrid in the Bernabeu on Tuesday . Real's Cristiano Ronaldo has scored more goals than the entire Liverpool team so far this season . James Rodriguez celebrates scoring in Real's 4-0 win at Granada on Saturday, their 11th win in succession . While Liverpool have won just six matches this season, Real have won their last 11 matches across all competitions, scoring a staggering 46 goals in the process. Liverpool have scored 13 in the same period. Any illusions Brendan Rodgers had about facing the might of the defending European champions were blown away at Anfield a fortnight ago when rampant Real won 3-0. Three first-half goals - one from Ronaldo and two from Benzema - exposed the massive gulf in quality between the two sides and that is likely to be repeated in the cauldron of the Bernabeu. The fact Rodgers is prepared to rest captain Steven Gerrard, who has made 127 European appearances in his career, and make other team changes with one eye on Saturday's visit of Chelsea suggests this is already a damage limitation exercise. Rodgers, who is coming under heavy criticism for not adequately replacing Luis Suarez over the summer, could also field the likes of Adam Lallana and Lazar Markovic to see if they can handle the big European nights. Chances are they - and mis-firing forward Mario Balotelli - will see very little of the ball. This will be a back-to-the-wall mission as Real come at them with all guns blazing. With Dejan Lovren also expected to be rested, 33-year-old Kolo Toure, who has started only League Cup games this season, and Martin Skrtel will attempt to stem the tide. Ronaldo alone will keep them both occupied. Even by his stratospheric standards, the Portuguese star is having an exceptional season. He has scored 22 goals in all competitions for Madrid this season. To put that stat into context, the entire Liverpool team has scored just 19. Carlo Ancelotti has Gareth Bale to call upon once again following his return from injury . Karim Benzema heads home Real's second goal in their 3-0 win at Anfield a fortnight ago . The French forward scored two goals in the one-sided win at Anfield as Liverpool were overpowered . Cristiano Ronaldo has scored 22 goals in all competitions this season; three more than Liverpool have managed in total. Indeed, Ronaldo has netted in each of his last 12 games for Real Madrid, scoring 20 in the process (1.7 per game). Cristiano Ronaldo (70) needs one more goal to equal Raul’s all-time goalscoring record in the Champions League (71 goals). Karim Benzema has scored in three successive CL appearances (four goals) – he hasn’t scored in four successive CL apps since March 2011. Benzema (7) has provided more assists than any other Real Madrid player this season (all comps). James Rodriguez has created 38 goalscoring chances in all competitions for Real Madrid this term, more than any other player. James Rodriguez and Cristiano Ronaldo celebrate the Portuguese player's goal in the Clasico with Barca . Real have scored 37 league goals so far in 2014/15; 10 more than any other side competing in the top five European leagues. Madrid have fired in 84 shots on target in league competition this term, the most of any team in the top five European leagues. Toni Kroos has made 704 successful passes this season (league only), 117 more than any Liverpool player. In the Champions League this season, Real Madrid have posted a shot conversion rate of 22.7 per cent (4th best); Liverpool have converted just 6.7 per cent of their shots. COURTESY OF OPTA . Ronaldo has also scored in his last 12 matches, making him the most in-form striker in world football and surely a shoo-in for the Ballon d'Or in the New Year. He is never more motivated than when there is a record to break and history could be made on Tuesday night if he scores the two goals required to overtake Raul as the Champions League's all-time top scorer. The former Real Madrid striker has 71, with Ronaldo just one behind. His great rival - Barcelona's Lionel Messi - is a further goal back on 69. Although Ronaldo is undoubtedly the scariest, he is merely the first of the demons Liverpool will have to slay in order to emerge with respectibility from this match. Spanish newspaper Marca believe Ronaldo will surpass Raul's Champions League scoring record . Liverpool's Steven Gerrard, Martin Skrtel and Mario Balotelli at the final whistle following their 1-0 loss at Newcastle in the Premier League on Saturday . Liverpool train at the Santiago Bernabeu on the eve of the Champions League showdown . 1. Raul (Real Madrid, Schalke) 71 goals . 2. Cristiano Ronaldo (Manchester United, Real Madrid) 70 . 3. Lionel Messi (Barcelona) 69 . 4. Ruud van Nistelrooy (PSV Eindhoven, Man United, Real Madrid) 56 . 5. Thierry Henry (Monaco, Arsenal, Barcelona) 50 . (excluding qualifying rounds) Bale is at Carlo Ancelotti's disposal once again after a gluteus injury but there are suggestions even the world's most expensive player will struggle to get back into the side, such is Real's brilliant recent form. In his absence they played Liverpool off the park at Anfield, won the first Clasico of the season 3-1 against Barcelona and then thrashed Granada 4-0 on Saturday. Bale was instrumental in Real's Decima triumph last season but now he's just a nice dilemma for Ancelotti to have with Isco also performing very well. Rodriguez, meanwhile, has looked better and better with every appearance in the famous white strip and scored a glorious left-foot volley at the weekend, his sixth of the season, that was every bit as good as the one for Colombia against Uruguay at the World Cup that encouraged Real to buy him. James has also contributed seven assists so far this season, more than anyone else in the Real team. Toni Kroos has already established himself as the heartbeat in the Real Madrid midfield . Yossi Benayoun heads home Liverpool's winner on their last visit to the Bernabeu in 2009 . Liverpool's slender away win in the last 16 tie was followed by a 4-0 rout of the Spanish side at Anfield . Benzema, meanwhile, can't really fail to benefit from such silver service and has nine goals to his credit already this season, while Toni Kroos looks as though he has been running the Real midfield for a decade. The German has played 704 successful passes this season and his passing accuracy is up at 93 per cent, making his £20m transfer fee look like a bargain. As if all this wasn't ominous enough, it is 940 days since Real last failed to score in a home match and it is over three-and-a-half years since they last lost a Champions League game at the Bernabeu. It really is difficult to find convincing reasons to suggest Liverpool can get something here but they did triumph on their last visit - 1-0 back in 2009, with Yossi Benayoun on target. Perhaps Rodgers can hold on to that as he prepares his team for what could well be a nightmarish evening.

And no more Whitney do you have to cry. You will always be our ribbon in the sky. And angel from God’s choir of love. Whitney an angel from the choir.

"Bobby Brown dramatically stormed out of his ex-wife Whitney Houston's funeral today. The 43-year-old singer was cheered by fans as he arrived - but according to a mourner at the service family became 'frustrated' inside. TMZ reports he became angry after the Houston family refused to seat his entourage of nine people. He had apparently been invited with a plus two. Insiders told the website Brown wanted to sit with his daughter Bobbi Kristina on the front row - but he was disallowed. Brown - who is set to take to the stage tonight in Connecticut to perform as part of his tour - has since released a statement, explaining his abrupt departure, saying he was moved by security three times. Driven off: Bobby Brown seen leaving Whitney Houston's funeral shortly after arriving. He stormed out after becoming 'frustrated' over seating arrangements and wanted to sit in the front row with daughter Bobbi Kristina . Sombre: Brown, pictured outside the New Hope Baptist Church in Newark, says he left because he was moved three times by security inside the church and was refused permission to see daughter Bobbi Kristina . Tender: The singer was seen talking to friends outside the church . Consoled: Bobby received a warm hug from a friend . In a statement put out by his . representative, he said: 'My children and I were invited to the funeral . of my ex-wife Whitney Houston.  We were seated by security and then . subsequently asked to move on three separate occasions. Kept apart: Brown says he was not allowed to see daughter Bobbi Kristina inside the ceremony . 'I fail to understand why security treated my family this way and continue to ask us and no one else to move,' he said. The statement went on: 'Security then . prevented me from attempting to see my daughter Bobbi Kristina. In light . of the events, I gave a kiss to the casket of my ex-wife and departed . as I refused to create a scene. 'My children are completely distraught . over the events. This was a day to honour Whitney. I doubt Whitney . would have wanted this to occur. I will continue to pay my respects to . my ex-wife the best way I know how.' A mourner told the MailOnline: 'He was frustrated about something, maybe somebody . said something to him or he was in a mood.' Meanwhile, the outspoken Reverend Al Sharpton revealed he had spoken to Brown in an attempt to calm him down. He tweeted: 'I am . at Whitney's funeral. I spoke with Bobby Brown trying to calm him down . and not distract from the services. Today is about Whitney!' He later spoke to reporters, sticking up for Brown. 'He showed nothing but love and respect for Whitney. I wish people would leave Bobby alone,' he said. Meanwhile Reverend Jesse Jackson told CNN reporters that Brown's daughter Bobbi Kristina and Houston's mother Cissy weren't aware of the fracas and did not see it happen from the two rows in front of Brown's designated seat. Jackson, who was seated on stage throughout the service and saw the incident occur, said he believed that the situation 'could have been handled better.' Early reports suggested Brown, who became divorced from Whitney in 2007, was denied entry to the New Hope Baptist Church in Newark, New Jersey. Shortly after the service began he was . seen leaving the church with a grim expression on his face accompanied . by a female companion. They stood outside for a few moments before getting in to a waiting SUV and drove off. Brown, who Houston's family blamed for her drug addiction, had . reportedly been invited after her family put aside their differences and . begrudgingly said he could come. Moments after the drama singer Stevie Wonder arrived and was led up the church steps and through the front door. As Brown was waiting outside the church an unidentified man stood next to him crying uncontrollably. Brown himself appeared to be wiping away a tear as he got into his car. Live coverage from inside Houston's funeral showed her daughter Bobbi Kristina and mother Cissy sat on the front row. Emotional time: Bobby and Whitney divorced in 2007.

Meanwhile, . it was claimed today that Houston's family members are encouraging . Bobbi Kristina to enter a live-in rehab facility as soon as possible. According . to TMZ, the late singer's relatives want Krissi to seek drug treatment, . but they are holding off on telling her until after Whitney's funeral . today. Send off: Houston's coffin is carried out of the church by pall bearers and loaded into the gold-coloured hearse . Sources connected . to Whitney's family tell the entertainment website that the 18-year-old . has struggled with substance abuse issues for the last three or four . years. Now family members are urging her to . get professional help at a 60-day live-in treatment facility before her . alleged drug use gets worse.

"It is too early to talk of dressing room mutiny but Barcelona coach Luis Enrique takes his team into Wednesday night's Champions League group game against Ajax with the murmurs of discontent gradually getting louder after two straight defeats. There is a strong suggestion that some players felt they were ill-prepared for the recent Clasico, as evidenced by French defender Jeremy Mathieu's post-match comments that he was surprised to find himself playing at left back when he had played all previous matches at centre back. Critics have been scratching their heads at what appears to be a breakdown in communication – surely the players would having gone over and over their defensive positions in the week leading up to the game? Was Mathieu not training in that position in the last few sessions before the match? Luis Enrique looks frustrated during Barcelona's most recent defeat against Celta Vigo in La Liga on Saturday . Lionel Messi isn't happy about Barcelona's latest mishap as Enrique looks to be losing the dressing room .

Enrique was asked about Mathieu's comments and he snapped: 'If a player who played regularly as a left back when he was at Valencia is surprised at playing there, then we might as well all pack up and go home.' The Frenchman is not the only one that Enrique's abrasive style may have rubbed up the wrong way. Gerard Pique was left in the stands for the team's last match against Celta Vigo after television images showed him using his telephone on the bench in the second half of the Catalan Super Cup final. Ever since the start of the season Pique has been left in little doubt that his place in the first team is anything but assured with Javier Mascherano and Mathieu preferred by Enrique. And the World Cup-winning defender is not the only one out of favour. Barcelona defender Gerard Pique was left in the stands for the team's last match against Celta Vigo . Barcelona train as Enrique (right) looks on ahead of visiting Ajax to play in the Champions League . a repeat of what happened in the Dutch capital last year will turn Barcelona's season  into full-blown crisis . Click here for more from Sportsmail's Match Zone . Jordi Alba was dropped for the Real Madrid game, as was Ivan Rakitic, despite being one of the outstanding performers in the first few weeks of the season. Rakitic was replaced by Xavi in the Clasico – a player who the Barca coach had largely ignored before the fixture. Players understand that no-one's place is secured but such unpredictable swings from favouring one to to another creates a sense of instability. Enrique was emotion-driven as a player, some Barca watchers are beginning to wonder if those characteristics need to be tamed now that he is in charge of such a big club. Not everyone is exposed to the whims of the coach. Lionel Messi was consulted about whether he felt he should be taken off in a match against Eibar earlier in the season and appeared to tell the bench that he wanted to stay on. When Enrique was criticized after the game for giving in to his talisman he made a point of taking Messi off at the end of the next match. But it seems the Argentine is the one man who does know where he stands with the Barca coach. Unfortunately for Enrique the areas of the team where he has been quick to drop important players is precisely the area where he now needs those players to play every week. Mathieu is ruled out for the next three matches with a calf injury and that leaves Enrique with just Mascherano, Marc Bartra and Pique as his central defensive options. The Argentine Mascherano is increasingly being touted as an option for a midfield that is currently shorn of the injured Andres Iniesta's talents. Barcelona have allowed Alex Song to go out on loan and sold Thiago Alcantara and Cesc Fabregas in the last two years while only bringing in Rakitic. And sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta has also failed to remedy a squad imbalance in the centre of defence. Enrique saw Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez fail to muster a goal against Celta Vigo at the weekend . Barcelona legend Johan Cruyff has attacked the current regime running the club after the Catalan giants slipped off the top of La Liga. CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL STORY . Thomas Vermaelen has not played for four months after breaking down at the World Cup and is not likely to feature any time soon and the decision to make him the key central defensive reinforcement looks increasingly flawed. The club is currently in the process of appealing FIFA's decision to ban them from signing players for two transfer windows. The court of arbitration in sport will tell them in December if the sanctions will end after the next window or if the ban continues into next summer. Whatever  the result the immediate consequences of not being about to bring in reinforcements at the turn of the year remain very much in place. Barcelona have not been fourth in the table at this stage of the season since the 2003-04 season. Enrique helps Neymar up during the La Liga loss ahead of their Champions League clash with Ajax . It is true that they have only conceded four goals all season and they possess the world's most feared front three. But Luis Suarez, Messi and Neymar failed to muster a goal at the weekend against Celta and there is a flat and forlorn feel to the side at the moment that only midfield spark and defensive security will help shift. On Tuesday they travelled to Amsterdam knowing that a repeat of what happened in the Dutch capital last year will only add to the sense of ensuing crisis. Enrique's team have been set three stern tests so far this campaign and failed them all. Paris Saint-Germain beat them in France earlier in their Champions League campaign, Real Madrid turned them over in the Clasico, and Celta Vigo brought their unbeaten away record to the Nou Camp and maintained it with a 1-0 win. Last season Barcelona suffered their first defeat of the season at the Amsterdam Arena after 20 games without a loss. The 2-1 set-back cast doubts over then coach Tata Martino.

Switzerland coach Ottmar Hitzfeld has warned his side against complacency as they prepare to start their World Cup campaign in Group E against Ecuador in Brasilia on Sunday. Veteran Hitzfeld has overseen a remarkable resurgence for his side, who qualified for the finals without losing a game and have been defeated just twice in 18 games over the last two years. Switzerland's serene progress towards Brazil is in stark contrast to their opponents, who squeezed into the final South American qualifying spot and have been hit by the loss of Segundo Castillo due to injury. And despite his unstinting conviction that his young side has it in them to go as far as the quarter-finals, Hitzfeld has acknowledged they must avoid suffering a slip-up in their Sunday opener. Despite their far from seamless qualification process, Ecuador will take some comfort from a 2-2 draw with England in their final warm-up game.

"Yaya Toure hit back on Tuesday after he was subjected to more racist abuse in the build-up to Manchester City’s crucial Champions League clash with CSKA Moscow. Toure was targeted on Twitter just hours after reactivating his account on Monday following a five-month break from social media, and yesterday described the abuse as ‘a disgrace’. Anti-racism group Kick It Out reported it to Greater Manchester Police who confirmed that they have launched an investigation. Yaya Toure received racist comments shortly after tweeting about the Manchester derby . Manchester City midfielder had only just reactivated the social networking site after five months away . City boss Manuel Pellegrini insisted that the issue will have no bearing on Toure’s participation in Wednesday's Group E tie against CSKA at the Etihad. The two teams were forced to play behind closed doors in Moscow two weeks ago due to UEFA sanctions against the Russian club dating back to the racist taunts aimed at Toure by their supporters in last season’s competition. The Ivory Coast star responded to the latest abuse, saying: ‘For me, it’s a disgrace to be honest. We need to do something to try to tell people those kinds of behaviour have to stop. ‘I want those people to understand what they’re doing is wrong. I’ve been attacked like that for many years. I will never stop telling them they are wrong and have to change. ‘To have such aggression in sport, I can’t understand that. That’s why I’ve been trying to fight it. Football doesn’t have a colour. We’re just people from all over the world trying to enjoy the game. I never see this in rugby, I never see that in tennis or anything else. I don’t know where it’s coming from.’ Anti-racism campaigners Kick It Out reported the racist comments to the police . Pellegrini denied that the controversy could be a distraction for Toure as City attempt to revive their flagging European campaign. ‘Yaya is an experienced player,’ he said. ‘He is always trying to fight against those things but I don’t think he will have any problem about that, to play in the way he knows.’ Pellegrini believes that despite having picked up just two points from the opening three group games, City can still turn Champions League gloom into glory this season by joining the list of clubs who recovered from a poor qualifying campaign to be crowned kings of Europe. The Premier League champions will have 11 points if they win their remaining three games against CSKA, Bayern Munich and Roma, although even that is only likely to guarantee second place. Toure congratulates match winner Sergio Aguero after his goal gave City a 1-0 victory over United . Toure was the victim of racist chanting when City played CSKA Moscow in last season's Champions League . Jose Mourinho led FC Porto to Champions League triumph from a similar position in 2003-04, and did the same with Inter Milan six years later despite winning only nine points from the group stage. Liverpool embarked on the road to Istanbul after finishing group runners-up with 10 points. ‘This is a very important game but it’s not a death match because until mathematics can’t fix it, you can continue,’ said Pellegrini. ‘There are teams who qualified with few points and then after that they won the Champions League. ‘It is impossible to be sure but I think this group will be decided in the last game in Italy against Roma.’ After playing to 8,000 empty seats against the Italians in their last home game and then an empty stadium in Moscow, City have declared tonight’s tie a 46,000 sellout on the back of a two-for-one ticket offer. However, they will be without defender Aleksandar Kolarov who has been ruled out for a month with the calf injury he suffered in the warm-up for Sunday’s Manchester derby.","Police are investigating claims Yaya Toure was racially abused on Twitter .

"Wales have named George North at outside centre for their opening autumn series Test against Australia on Saturday. The Northampton winger has just one international start in midfield – against France in February - but injuries to Jonathan Davies (shoulder) and Scott Williams (hamstring) have forced head coach Warren Gatland to make the call. North, 22, will partner experienced Racing Metro centre Jamie Roberts in a line-up that sees Lions pair Gethin Jenkins and Mike Phillips demoted to the bench. North celebrates scoring during last year's narrow defeat to Australia, and will start in the centre this time . The Northampton winger trains with Wales ahead of the Millennium stadium clash on Saturday . North has been in superb form for his club so far this season, and will hope to carry that into the Test series . Leigh Halfpenny (Toulon), Alex Cuthbert (Cardiff Blues), George North (Northampton Saints), Jamie Roberts (Racing Metro), Liam Williams (Scarlets), Dan Biggar (Ospreys), Rhys Webb (Ospreys), Paul James (Bath), Richard Hibbard (Gloucester), Samson Lee (Scarlets), Jake Ball (Scarlets), Alun Wyn Jones (Ospreys), Dan Lydiate (Unattached), Sam Warburton (Capt), Taulupe Faletau (Newport Gwent Dragons). Replacements: Scott Baldwin (Ospreys), Gethin Jenkins (Cardiff Blues), Rhodri Jones (Scarlets), Bradley Davies (London Wasps), Justin Tipuric (Ospreys), Mike Phillips (Racing Metro), Rhys Priestland (Scarlets), Cory Allen (Cardiff Blues). ‘Injuries in the midfield means we get to see Jamie and George line-up together there again and we were pleased with how that went earlier in the year,’ said Gatland. ‘We have spoke a lot about this autumn and the year ahead and we are really excited to kick off the campaign this weekend. ‘We have had a couple of very hard weeks at training, the squad have been put their paces but come have come through well.’ North’s place on the wing will be filled by 23-year-old Scarlet Liam Williams, who will join Alex Cuthbert and Leigh Halfpenny in the back-three for the Millennium Stadium opener. Lions veteran Philips is replaced by scrum half Rhys Webb, who has impressed in the Guinness Pro12 and forms a half-back combination with his Ospreys team-mate Dan Biggar. Warren Gatland says his team 'are really excited to kick off the campaign' against Australia . Captain Sam Warburton  (second right) returns to the line-up as an openside flanker, alongside Dan Lydiate . Bath loose-head Paul James takes over in the front row from Jenkins, while Sam Warburton returns to the starting XV at outside flanker after missing the summer tour to South Africa. There was the option to switch Warburton to the blindside and bring in natural No7 Justin Tipuric, but Gatland has kept faith in Dan Lydiate, despite the flanker recently being released by French club Racing Metro. Jake Ball is named ahead of Wasps lock Bradley Davies, while Richard Hibbard, Samson Lee, Alun Wyn Jones and Taulupe Faletau complete the pack. Jamie Roberts will partner North in the centre, the pair making only their second appearance together . ‘We have been impressed with the form of Rhys and Dan at half-back for the Ospreys so it will be good to see hem together on this stage again,’ said Gatland. ‘Paul James and Jake Ball have impressed as well so they get the nod to start. ‘The last few outings against Australia have been extremely tight, we are expecting the same this weekend and its going to be another huge battle but it’s a challenge we are really looking forward to.’","Injuries mean George North will partner Jamie Roberts in the centres .

"Millions of customers are expected to switch their energy providers after British Gas and npower both announced inflation-busting price rises. The two firms face an exodus after unveiling charges that mean consumers would be as much as £200 a year better off if they moved. British Gas, which supplies energy to 8.5million households, is increasing its tariffs by 6 per cent – around £80 a year. The announcement was followed hours later by npower, which said gas would go up by 8.8 per cent and electricity by 9.1 per cent – adding around £103 to the annual bill. Inflation-busting: Millions of customers are expected to switch their energy providers after British Gas and npower announced price rises . Both firms blamed the Government’s green policies as well as rising wholesale prices for the increases. But Chancellor George Osborne last night urged energy companies to rethink their price rises. He said: ‘I’m concerned when I see electricity bills going up. We’ve got to do everything we can in Britain to try and keep those bills down. ‘I would urge those energy companies to look again at any increases to see if they are absolutely necessary at a time like this.’ The latest increases will take the average yearly bill for a British Gas customer paying by monthly direct debit to £1,265, while the figure for those at npower goes up to £1,252. Npower customers who pay by cash or cheque will pay £1,357, which is an increase of £112. 'Concerned': Chancellor George Osborne urged energy companies to rethink their price rises and said that 'we've got to do everything we can in Britain to try and keep those bills down' The rises will kick in next month when customers feeling the winter chill are particularly vulnerable. The two announcements, coming within hours of each other, fuelled claims that the energy giants are working as a loose cartel, raising prices at the same time to the same level. Consumer groups said the rises represented a ‘Black Friday’ for families and would be a disaster for vulnerable groups who face a choice between heating and eating. They urged customers to fight back by switching to small suppliers or to a fixed price deal. Energy supplies are dominated by six major companies – British Gas, SSE, npower, E.ON, EDF and Scottish Power. Rising prices: Graph showing the difference between wholesale and retail gas prices . SSE is putting up its prices by 9 per cent from Monday, while British Gas tariffs will rise on November 16 and those at npower on November 26. Audrey Gallacher, of the official customer body, Consumer Focus, said the public would be suspicious about the rise in bills. ‘Two price hikes on the same day will . just reinforce the views and prejudices of consumers – whether justified . or not – about a lack of transparency and competitiveness in the . market,’ she said. Switching energy suppliers is easy, yet 60 per cent of households have never moved. Many have developed a loyalty to their supplier and have viewed the whole switching process as complex or risky. However, this loyalty is often repaid with higher charges – while firms focus their attention on launching cheaper deals to attract new customers. The simplest way to cut a bill is to stop paying by cash or cheque and change to monthly direct debit. This can save £80 a year. Big savings come from switching to internet-based accounts. Customers provide their own meter readings, paper bills are replaced by email alerts and payments are made by direct debit. There is a raft of price comparison and switching services on the internet, including Which?, uSwitch, and MoneySupermarket, which make switching as straightforward as possible. ‘Our research shows over six million households in England already plan to cut back on their heating this winter because they are worried about affording their bills.’ Consumer Focus encouraged customers to switch away from the high tariffs, saying: ‘We would encourage consumers to do what they can to cut their bills by switching tariff, payment method and supplier.’ Currently, the cheapest option comes from First Utility, which operates an internet-based energy account charging an average of £1,054 a year. Profits at British Gas were up by 23 per cent in the first half of 2012 to £345million, which contributed to a 15 per cent rise at parent company Centrica, which made £1.45billion. British Gas Managing Director, Phil Bentley, insisted the price rises were necessary. ‘We simply cannot ignore the rising costs that are largely outside our control, but which make up most of the bill,’ he said. ‘Britain’s North Sea gas supplies are running out, and British Gas has to pay the going rate for gas in a competitive global marketplace.  The investment needed to maintain and upgrade the national grid to deliver energy to our customers’ homes, and the costs of the Government’s policies for a clean, energy efficient Britain are all going up.’ Mr Osborne acknowledged that the energy companies need to invest in infrastructure but said they should not use that as an excuse to ramp up prices. ‘I think energy companies should make sure they’re only adding to their bills the absolute minimum they need to add to continue investing in our energy supply and they’re not going beyond that,’ he said. ENERGY giant npower has blamed the Government’s green taxes for its increased fuel bills.The company said the rush to cut carbon emissions was a major factor in it driving up charges by 9 per cent. Huge costs are involved in subsidising wind farms and building a new network of cables and pylons to connect them to the national grid. An average of £4billion will be taken from consumer bills from next year to support the shift to green and nuclear energy. Taxes to blame: npower has blamed the Government's green taxes for its increased fuel bills, claiming they had to rush to cut carbon emssions . From yesterday's Mail . Regulations from Brussels and . Westminster mean energy firms face penalty charges if they create . electricity from coal, oil or gas. The companies then pass this charge on to consumers. Separately, levies have been built into bills to raise money to fund so-called ‘free’ insulation for customers. Npower’s chief commercial officer, Paul Massara, said: ‘There is never a good time to increase energy bills, particularly when so many are working hard to make ends meet. ‘But the costs of new statutory schemes, increases in distribution charges and the price of gas for the coming winter are all being driven up by external factors, for example government policy.’ He added: ‘We support moves to reduce CO2 emissions but new government schemes will mean that energy bills will rise.’ Costly: npower say there are huge costs involved in subsidising wind farms (pictured) and building a new network of cables and pylons to connect them to the national grid .","British Gas and npower announced price rises .

"Like this, but smaller: Apple has now released three generations of iPad - and rumours suggest a baby brother is on the way . Apple is planning to launch an assault against the burgeoning Android tablet market by releasing an 'iPad Mini' - at a loss-making price of around £150, according to new claims. The bargain-basement priced tablet will even feature the same 'Retina' display featured on its big brother, bringing the same 3.1million pixels to a smaller 7-8"" display. Sources told Apple fansite iMore that the aggressively-priced tablet will launch in October this year, with Apple potentially selling the sub-$250 tablet at a loss in order to leave no room for competition. With Apple sitting on cash reserves of $100bn, the tech giant should at least be able to stomach such a move financially. iMore reported: 'Today's claim says that Apple is going to step-up . the pressure on Android tablet manufacturers with an iPad mini that will . sell for a surprisingly low $200-250. 'That's a bit hard to accept in the light of the other major claim . this rumor makes, that the iPad mini will keep the full-sized iPad's . 2048x1536 resolution. 'If this is true, Apple might have to take a serious cut to its . margins, if not sell the mini at a loss. Considering the kind of cash . Apple has on hand, though, it might be willing to take the hit just to . help kill-off competition from Android tablets.' If the iPad sells for $250 in the States, that would . translate to £150 in the UK, although whether Apple would respect . currency rates is up for debate. With the screen as a premium feature, it is likely sacrifices will be made in other parts of the tablet, such as reduced storage space of, for instance, 8GB for your apps, videos and music. This will likely cause issues for users as that amount of space will be used up quickly, marking this out as very much a budget tablet. However, it will also appeal to people who want an iPad for casual browsing and occasional use of apps and movies, but who are not willing to shell out £400 for the bigger brother. iMore and another website, Daring Fireball, have separately heard that Apple has already built the seven-inch device, and the only decision left is whether to 'go to market'. Both iMore and Daring Fireball have proven to be reliable sources of internal Apple discussions in the past. Something new to the table(t): Previously there has only been two flavours of iPad - black and white . Android tablets can be found at around the £200 mark, including the Android-based Amazon Fire, held here by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos . Steve Jobs hated the thought of a smaller iPad, calling them 'dead on arrival'. He said people did not wish to use smaller tablets for video-playback, and feared a smaller tablet would serve as a bridge between the iPad and the iPhone, resulting in app-makers simply 'stretching' their phone apps for the tablet. In a 2010 earnings call, he said: 'One naturally thinks that a seven-inch screen would offer 70 percent of . the benefits of a ten-inch screen. 'Unfortunately, this is far from the truth. … The reason we won't make a seven-inch tablet isn’t because we don’t want to hit a . lower price point, it’s because we think the screen is too small to . express the software.' Steve Jobs' feelings towards seven-inch tablets was reported in his official biography, among other places . Another big problem - which Android is struggling to deal with - would be the resulting fragmentation, with app-makers having to invest more money for coding different versions of their apps for different devices, something Apple has almost entirely succeeded at avoiding so far. With the Android tablet market maturing, and competitors like Amazon launching their own tablets such as the Kindle Fire at less than $200, it would make sense for Apple to join the burgeoning cheaper market, although the company may be concerned about devaluing their premium brand, which is associated with high prices but also high quality. However the company has previous form with cheaper models. The iPod music player was released in 2001, and in 2004 and 2005 the iPod Minis and Nanos were released, bringing elements of Apple's flagship device to a cheaper market. In March, a source from within competitor Samsung made a 'mini' indescretion while talking to the Korea Times. While discussing Apple and Samsung's $9.7billion deal for Samsung to manufacturer parts of the iPad, an official said: 'The contract is expected to rise to $11billion by the end of this . year as Apple is planning to release a smaller iPad, probably with a . 7.85-inch screen, and to sell more of its MacBook Air PCs using . Samsung’s faster solid state drive storage.'","Claims suggest Apple will launch iPad Mini this October for between $200-$250 .

"He may be unbeaten this season but Jose Mourinho appeared chastened as he arrived in Slovenia where Chelsea can secure a place in the Champions League knock-out phase and attempted to explain himself to supporters upset by his stinging words. Mourinho confessed he may have gone 'a little bit too far' by claiming Stamford Bridge was like an 'empty stadium' after Saturday's win against QPR, but he insisted it was only because he cared so much. 'Everybody knows how much I love the club,' said the Chelsea boss. 'How much I want it to improve and how much I want to be part of the club in the future. Everybody knows. Even a moment of criticism has to be analysed with different eyes, with the eyes of somebody who knows why I came back to Chelsea and why I'm here with my heart and why I want to stay for a long, long time. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho admits he may have gone too far criticising the Blues' support . The Blues boss, pictured at training on Tuesday insists the criticism was because he cares so much . 'I am just somebody who loves football a lot. I love my job. I am lucky to do my job in the club I like so much and feel such a connection and maybe that makes me lead the club with a different emotion. 'If I don't do it in a professional way and concentrate only on training and selection, it is because this is not, for me, just a job. It is more than that, because it's Chelsea. Maybe I go a little bit too far. 'But I see myself in the stands, watching Chelsea and I want to play, I want to help. If I'm not a player I cannot play, if I'm not a coach I cannot make decisions. If I'm just a fan what can I do to help? That's just my view.'

'I enjoy football and part of the enjoyment is to try always to be better. 'Part of the enjoyment is to play in the best competitions against the best opponents, coaching the best players, the best clubs, never being satisfied. If you look through coach's eyes you can always find things you can improve. Always. 'Especially when people have talent, because I don't like people to waste their talent. If you don't have talent you have live with what you have. But when you have talent – and I have talented players – they must feel there is always space to improve.' Mourinho will balance the idea of and resting players against Maribor - thrashed 6-0 in London two weeks ago - with the desire to win Group G quickly. His team have a lunchtime date at Liverpool on Saturday but he will be conscious of how a young Chelsea team made a meal of beating League Two Shrewsbury in the Capital One Cup. Maribor boss Ante Simundza insisted there would be 'no fear' but it hard to imagine Chelsea failing to top Group G from this position. They will qualify for the last 16 if they win tonight(WED) and Sporting Lisbon fail to beat Schalke in Portugal. Perhaps with Liverpool's team selection in Madrid in mind, Mourinho added: 'I like the concept of going with a big club, full of big players, to a city where normally they don't come.

"Instagram is no longer allowing Twitter users to view its photographs in tweets in an effort to drive more people away from the rival social media company to its own website. Kevin Systrom, the CEO of the photo-sharing service that was snapped up by Facebook earlier this year, announced today that Instagram has turned off support for 'Twitter cards,' signaling a deepening rift between two of the web's biggest brands. Twitter users started to complain earlier this week in public messages that Instagram photos were not displaying properly on Twitter's website. Clarifying the situation today, Mr Systrom released a statement saying: 'We believe the best experience is for us to link back to where the content lives.' Rivals: The move to distance themselves from Twitter signals a deepening rift between Facebook and Twitter since the latter bought Instagram in April . Instagram started off as a smartphone application-only service but has recently improved its website. 'A handful of months ago, we supported Twitter cards because we had a minimal web presence,' Mr Systrom said, noting that the company has since released new features that allow users to comment about and 'like' photos directly on Instagram's website. The rivalry between Facebook and Twitter intensified in April when the former outbid Twitter to nab fast-growing Instagram in a cash-and-stock deal valued at the time at $1 billion. The acquisition closed in September for roughly $715 million, due to Facebook's recent stock drop. The companies' ties have been strained since. In July, Twitter blocked Instagram from using its data to help new Instagram users find friends. No support: Twitter users will be driven to Instagram's own website by a link after Twitter cards, pictured, are scrapped . Link: Twitter users will just see a link, pictured, that will take them to the Instagram website . Photos are among the most popular features on both Facebook and Twitter, and Instagram's meteoric rise in recent years has further proved how picture-sharing has become a key front in the battle for social media supremacy. Instagram, which has 100 million users, allows consumers to tweak the photos they take on their smartphones and share the images with their friends, a feature that Twitter has reportedly also begun to develop. Twitter's executive chairman Jack Dorsey was an investor in Instagram and hoped to acquire it before Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg tabled a successful bid. When Mr Zuckerberg announced the acquisition in an April blog post, he said one of Instagram's strengths was its inter-connectivity with other social networks and pledged to continue running it as an independent service. Pledge: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg pledged to keep Instagram's ties to other social networks including Twitter, pictured, when he bought it in April . 'We think the fact that Instagram is connected to other services beyond Facebook is an important part of the experience,' Mr Zuckerberg wrote. 'We plan on keeping features like the ability to post to other social networks.' A Twitter spokesman declined to comment on Wednesday, but a status message on Twitter's website confirmed that users are 'experiencing issues,' such as 'cropped images' when viewing Instagram photos on Twitter. Mr Systrom noted that Instagram users will be able to 'continue to be able to share to Twitter as they originally did before the Twitter Cards implementation.'","Twitter users can no longer embed Instagram photos directly into tweets .

"Facebook $1 billion acquisition of . photo-sharing service Instagram is under scrutiny by the U.S. Federal . Trade Commission - who are also questioning rivals Google and Twitter. Inside sources said it was not immediately clear what specific information the FTC  was looking for. The acquisition of the top photo-sharing service on the Internet is a crucial part of Facebook's strategy to bolster its mobile offerings, at a time when consumers are increasingly accessing the Internet through smarpthones. Probe: An investigation has been launched into the Facebook deal to acquire photo file-sharing service Instagram for $1billion . Facebook had said it hopes to complete the deal - the largest in Facebook's history - in the second quarter, but some observers think that may be an ambitious target, given the size of the deal and Facebook's status as the world's No.1 Internet social network with roughly 900 million users. The FTC's review of the deal comes as Facebook is preparing to raise as much as $12 billion in a record-breaking initial public offering that could occur as soon as next week. Some investors have cited Facebook's limited advertising revenue from the mobile versions of its service as a potential concern with regards to the company's long-term growth potential. Facebook and Twitter declined to comment. Google was not immediately available for comment. Future: The merger between Facebook and Instagram, which popular among celebrities like Kim Kardashian, could improve Facebook's mobile strategy . Facebook has also acquired other start-ups such as Glancee in the run-up to its initial public offering on the stock market - expected to be the biggest silicon valley has ever seen. The extraordinarily popular social . network, now eight years old, has 900million members and could raise as . much as $100billion - £61.6billion - at the launch.

He . will speak to major buyers - such as investment bankers - to allow them . to evaluate the company's management and prospects. Their interest, or . lack of, will play a major role in the final flotation price. The company hopes to raise about $5billion in the offering, giving the entire company a value of about . $100billion. Ready to launch? Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of the company, is expected to lead the IPO roadshow, rumoured to begin next week . Facebook's revenue has dropped - leaving investors worried ahead ahead of the float . The world's largest social network reported its first quarter-to-quarter revenue slide in at least two years. Investors . took it as a sign that the social network's sizzling growth may be . cooling as it prepares to go public in the biggest-ever Internet IPO. 'It was a faster slowdown than we would have guessed,’ said Brian Wieser, an analyst with Pivotal Research Group. ‘No . matter how you slice it, for a company that is perceived as growing so . rapidly, to slow so much on whatever basis - sequentially or annually - . it will be somewhat concerning to investors if faced with a lofty . valuation,’ Wieser said. The IPO was thought to be delayed . after Zuckerberg 'single-handedly' bought photo-sharing site Instagram . for a billion dollars last month, but now the IPO process seems to have . begin in earnest, with a source telling Reuters that the acquisition . review processes are almost complete.

"Liberal Democrats have triggered fury by vowing to overturn David Cameron’s plans for internet porn filters. Child safety experts and MPs called the move ‘irresponsible’ and warned it would undermine attempts to protect children from hardcore pornography. Lib Dem party president Tim Farron said the Government should enshrine the ‘digital rights of the citizen’ and halt requirement for ‘filters, lists or controls on legal material’. Row: Lib Dem party president Tim Farron said filters blocking porn are 'illiberal' and hamper 'digital rights' Mr Farron said filters were ‘misconceived, ineffective and illiberal’. A motion set to be adopted at the party’s spring conference will say ‘families and individuals should decide how they wish to use them’. He warned ‘essential sites’ on sex education and gay rights were being blocked, while porn was slipping through filters. ‘Our motion is designed to strengthen Lib Dem ministers’ hands in challenging this nonsensical policy, which has yet to be brought before the House of Commons,’ he said. ‘If the Prime Minister really wanted to protect children from inappropriate material, he’d ensure they had access to good sexual health and relationship education.’ John Carr, of the Children’s Charities’ Coalition on Internet Safety, accused Lib Dems of rushing to judgement. Filters are not perfect but they can help busy parents keep some of the most awful stuff away from their children's machines . - John Carr, Childrens Charities Coalition on Internet Safety . He said: ‘When the Lib Dems say they do not want internet service providers to make it easier to use filters, what are they saying to parents? ‘Filters are not perfect but they can help busy parents keep some of the most awful stuff away from their children’s machines.’ Mr Carr said internet providers plan to spend £25million on a public awareness campaign to explain how filters work. Conservative MP Julian Smith said: ‘Tim Farron is clearly putting his Lib Dem leadership ambitions ahead of our children’s protection. ‘Instead of looking ahead to 2015 and pandering to the loony left in his party, he should be . . . prioritising the safety of children online.’ Culture Secretary Maria Miller is in charge of the policy which is under review at the moment . Laura Perrins, of Mothers At Home Matter, said: ‘Online filters are one tool in helping protect families but no one  is pretending that they are  a panacea.’ Helen Goodman, Labour’s media spokesman, said: ‘It’s typically irresponsible of the Liberal Democrats to oppose this protection. ‘It is important our children are protected from 18-rated material. That should not include gay helplines or normal sex education websites but if anything the initial problems strengthen my belief that we need one unified standard and filtering system.’ Labour has pledged to bring in mandatory filters if the coalition’s voluntary approach is found to have failed. The party wants all filters to abide by British Board of Film Classification ratings. A Tory source said: ‘It is bizarre that the Lib Dems have decided protecting children online is no longer important. ‘But luckily the Tories do and a Tory Secretary of State [Culture Secretary Maria Miller] is in charge of this policy.’ Miranda Suit, of Safer Media, which campaigned for a block on online porn, said: ‘Everyone knew there could be teething problems but to ditch the entire policy seems entirely disproportionate.’ A Lib Dem party spokesman said Mr Farron’s intervention ‘is not agreed party policy’. He pointed out Lib Dem Baroness Benjamin had called for tougher controls on porn.","Party president Tim Farron said filters hamper 'digital rights of the citizen'

"Julian Savea will aim to continue his astonishing scoring streak against England at Twickenham on Saturday, having been feted as ‘better’ than Jonah Lomu — his childhood idol. Last month, All Blacks coach Steve Hansen suggested that his team’s supreme finisher had become a more deadly threat than Lomu, who terrorised England at the 1995 World Cup. Savea has certainly demonstrated a greater scoring knack, having touched down 29 times in 30 Tests. He is on course to be the most predatory accumulator of tries in the history of the international game — eclipsing Lomu and other Kiwi icons such as Doug Howlett and Christian Cullen. Julian Savea sprints clear to score one of his two tries in New Zealand victory at Twickenham last year . And while the Wellington wing known as the ‘Bus’ has caused havoc against all-comers, he has been especially prolific whenever he has had the Red Rose in his sights; striking eight times in just four matches. Hansen’s tribute to his demolition man in the No 11 shirt was emphatic. ‘I think he’s probably better than Lomu,’ he said during the recent Rugby Championship. ‘He can do more things than Jonah. Jonah was a great player, but I think Julian has got more to his game and that’s saying something. I genuinely believe that. He’s very good going back, under the high ball, with the ball on the ground, as well as being a greater carrier.’ Savea was reminded on Tuesday of being placed on a higher pedestal than his iconic hero and he found it difficult to come to terms with such heady praise. Jonah Lomu on his way to scoring one of his four tries against England in the 1995 Rugby World Cup . Lomu and Savea are similar in stature and the younger has drawn many comparisons to his idol . ‘For Steve to compare me to Lomu and say I am better was an honour and a privilege,’ he said. ‘But for me, no-one’s better than Jonah. ‘He was my idol growing up. I even had his haircut! I fell asleep at the barbers and the guy shaved it off. I was pretty upset. Lomu changed the game back in his era and inspired a lot of kids, so to me no-one is ever going to be better. He was one in a million.’ Savea is 24, and was only four when Lomu created one of the game’s enduring images as he trampled Tony Underwood and Mike Catt under foot on his way to scoring against England. His stunning performance in that 1995 World Cup semi-final led the then England captain, Will Carling, to label him a ‘freak’. Asked if he recalled the game, Savea smiled and said: ‘I remember that!’ Savea has scored an incredible 29 tries for New Zealand in just 30 appearances . Savea is 13kg lighter than Lomu in his prime, but is creating similar mayhem among opposition defences as the great man once did, and he is crossing the line more often, too. Asked if he hoped to surpass Howlett’s national try record of 49 in 62 Tests, he admitted: ‘It would be pretty special to get there.’ His latest telling contribution against England was a first-half hat-trick as the All Blacks thrashed the tourists in Hamilton in June, but the executioner-in-chief is utterly modest in assessing his own devastating work. ‘I try to bring a lot of excitement,’ he said. ‘I try to execute as much as I can. The boys inside me come up with their offloads and skill execution, and I’m just happy to finish them off. It just happens to be against England.’ Savea races clear for his third try in New Zealand's win over England in Hamilton in June . Such is Savea’s desire to emphasise the collective contribution to his solo feats, it is more instructive to listen to others talking about him. New Zealand No 8 Kieran Read — the current IRB world Player of the Year, offered a strong endorsement of his electric team-mate. ‘The majority of his tries are looking after a team effort and him finishing them off, but he is probably the best winger in the world at the moment. We just have to give him a bit of space. It’s my job and our job to give him the ball in as much space as we can and let him do his thing.’ The hosts certainly know all about his potency. ‘He’s very powerful first and foremost,’ said Owen Farrell yesterday. Liam Messam and Jerome Kaino demonstrate an unusual training technique as New Zealand train on Tuesday . This time it's Kaino's turn to hitch a ride as Messam does the heavy lifting . Superstar Sonny Bill Williams looks in relaxed mood as he wears a baseball cap during training . ‘One on one you have to be able to put your head down and get stuck in. He constantly holds really good width and the players inside him can get the ball to him. He’s a brilliant finisher, but he’s got that power as well.’ As a finisher, Savea is on course to trump his idol and be the greatest there has ever been. No matter how well they prepare, England will struggle to contain him. Additional reporting: Joe Ridge .","England face New Zealand at Twickenham on Saturday .

Brendan Rodgers' decision to field a weakened team for Liverpool's Champions League clash against Real Madrid was not the unmitigated disaster many predicted.

'Maybe if somebody find a card they just put it in the [lost property] basket and forget.' Mr Pussell was carrying out a routine check of lost property on Tuesday when he found the camera card. Mrs Benetti said she was initially mad at her husband for losing the pictures. 'I became angry because we are in Italy and Australia is too far for us. You travel to there once in a lifetime,' she said. 'I lost all of the memories of the trip on the last day of the trip.' Mrs Benetti said after a busy day of sightseeing they noticed their SD card was missing but they failed to track it down. Mr Pussell couldn't bring himself to delete the photos so he tracked the couple down on Facebook . Mrs Benetti said she was initially mad at her husband for losing the pictures . 'We were in Sydney and we went to the aquarium, Bondi Beach, we went to Opera House so we didn't know where it was lost,' she told MailOnline. 'We went to aquarium to find it but maybe they did not clean the basket. 'The next day I must travel to Fiji islands so I did not leave my contact information.' Mr and Mrs Benetti, who work for the same iron and steel flange manufacturer, married in Italy on June 23 2012 and they went on a four week honeymoon around Australia, visiting Darwin, Katherine George, Alice Springs, Uluru, Cairns and Sydney before travelling to Fiji. Mrs Benetti gave birth to her first child, daughter Arianna, on April 14 this year and exactly one month later she got the news that her missing photos were found which she described as a 'really nice gift'. Her friend saw Mr Pussell's photo on Facebook, which has been shared more than 166,000 times, and alerted her that her missing SD card had been found.

Mr and Mrs Benetti, who work for the same iron and steel flange manufacturer near Milan, married in Italy on June 23 2012 . Ms Benetti could not message Mr Pussell because of his Facebook account settings so she messaged his friend Ben Spalding, who used to work with Mr Pussell in France. Mr Pussell told MailOnline he got a call from Mr Spalding at 11pm on Thursday night saying the couple had been found. He said he was amazed at the response his post received. 'I had no idea it would go as worldwide as it did,' he said. 'They always took photos of the Italian plaques, Italian things so I sort of figured they were from Italy. 'I put it on there because I used to work in Europe so I have a few Italian friends.' Mr Pussell, who has spoken to Mrs Benetti via text message, said she was completely surprised and overwhelmed. The photos Mr Pussell found document Mr and Mrs Benetti's entire trip around Australia, like this shot from Kata Tjuta in the Northern Territory .

Mr Pussell was carrying out a routine check of lost property on Tuesday when he found the camera card. 'We were doing an inventory of lost property and as usual there are lots of cameras. I found a box full so I took everything out and underneath there was a lonely SD card,' Mr Pussell told MailOnline. 'It had been there for a while so I took it home with the intent of reformatting it so I could use it in my camera.' Mr Pussell said he was shocked to find hundreds of romantic photos of a couple in front of Australia's most famous landmarks. 'The first photo is of her showing off her wedding ring. The last photo is in (Sydney's) Darling Harbour. They're classic honeymoon photos and they've been everywhere,' he said. 'I couldn't bring myself to delete them.'

"With a 50ft Hello Kitty helium balloon plane soaring between Manhattan's high rises, the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade was off to a flying start. Three million cheering spectators swarmed the route to see 16 giant helium balloons, including Spider-Man, SpongeBob SquarePants and Kermit the Frog, bob their way through the streets of New York City for the 86th annual parade. Parade stalwarts including Buzz Lightyear, Sailor Mickey Mouse, Harold the Fireman and the Pillsbury Doughboy floated along the city's streets while a predicted 50 million people watched from the warmth of their homes. There were also newcomers in the balloon lineup, among them Papa . Smurf and the new version of Hello Kitty. A 53-ft-tall Pikachu float with cheeks that light up is the first ever electrical balloon in the parade. Organisers said they hoped the parade will lift the spirits of New Yorkers still recovering from the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy, and thousands of those affected were given front-row seats by Macy's.

It kicked off at 9am at 77th Street and Central Park West, continued on to Columbus Circle and turned onto Central Park South. The parade then snaked down Sixth Avenue and headed from 59th Street down to 34th Street, making its final stop at Macy's Herald Square. The helium balloons joined 28 floats, 1,600 cheerleaders and dancers, 900 clowns, 11 marching bands and, of course, Santa Claus.

"Eying a bargain: Sir Richard Branson . Sir Richard Branson wants to buy 316 branches from Royal Bank of Scotland – but at a knockdown price thought to be around £1billion less than was previously on the table. The entrepreneur’s Virgin Money has had informal contact with RBS about a possible purchase after the deal to sell the branches to Santander collapsed on Friday. Sources said Virgin Money, which tabled a bid in 2010 but lost out to the Spanish bank, would be ‘very interested if the price is right’. It is thought the Branson company has a price tag of around £650million in mind, far less than the £1.65billion Santander had been willing to pay and only half the ‘book value’ RBS places on the business. RBS is 83 per cent owned by the taxpayer after a £45billion bailout. Yesterday consumer groups expressed fears that taxpayers could lose out if the branches, along with 1.8million personal and small business customers, are offloaded to Virgin Money. Eddie Wetherill, of the Independent Banking Advisory Service, said: ‘I would have concerns about this because the UK taxpayer is already in for a substantial amount of money on RBS and we could come out of it with a big loss. ‘You can’t blame Branson for trying it on as he is an entrepreneur with an eye for opportunities. But I don’t trust a system that allows entrepreneurs to feather their nest. ‘In government they don’t seem capable of getting a good deal for the taxpayer. That is the problem. It would have to be watched very, very carefully. 'If Branson is the only bidder, he will pare down the price to the bone. He is not stupid.’ Virgin Money took over the ‘good bank’ part of Northern Rock in January in a deal that has lost the taxpayer between £175million and £289million, according to watchdog the National Audit Office. It now has 75 branches and 4million savings and mortgage customers. However, it has only 100,000 current account customers. Money maker: Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Money took over the 'good bank' part of Northern Rock - losing the taxpayer as much as £289million . RBS was ordered by the European Commission to sell the 316 branches as a condition of its taxpayer bailout. It signed a preliminary agreement with Santander in August 2010 and the deal was initially expected to complete by the end of last year. Negotiations were called off last week by Santander chief executive Ana Botin at a face-to-face meeting with her RBS opposite number Stephen Hester. Deal breaker: Santander pulled the plug on a deal to buy 316 RBS branches due to concerns over the bailed-out bank's IT systems . She is thought to have told Mr Hester that the delays, which are understood to have been caused by RBS’s creaking computer systems, had dragged on too long. Her decision leaves RBS casting about for a new buyer ahead of a deadline of the end of 2013. Other possible buyers include NBNK, which lost out this summer to the Co-op in the race to take over 632 Lloyds branches. RBS could ask the European Commission to let it keep the branches or extend the deadline. It is also considering floating the branches as a business on the stock market under the old Williams & Glyn’s name, or selling them to management. The mission by Sir Richard Branson, pictured right, to stamp his Virgin branding on every aspect of life knows  no limits. It is only days since he forced an embarrassing climbdown by the Department of Transport in its decision to hand his West Coast rail franchise to rival FirstGroup. Far from resting on his laurels, the opportunistic tycoon is now preparing to pounce on 316 Royal Bank of Scotland branches. Branson loves to present himself as an iconoclast, a man of the people and a consumer champion in the stuffy world of business. He would have us believe his Virgin Money is a breath of fresh air bringing much-needed competition into Britain’s jaded and corrupt banking sector. At least Branson is British, so it would not be yet another overseas takeover. But he is a billionaire carpetbagger. The thought of him squatting atop his labyrinthine business empire in his paradise island of Necker, plotting a predatory swoop on RBS, is deeply disquieting. No wonder he is eyeing the RBS branches. After all, the Government has already allowed him to pull off one quite stunning coup with his purchase of the ‘good’ bit of Northern Rock. The National Audit Office says that transaction lost the taxpayer anywhere between £175million and £289million. Meanwhile, taxpayers are still on the hook for the ‘bad’ part of  Northern Rock, which depends on a £21billion state bailout. The Government may feel a need to appease Branson after the rail debacle, but it should resist any temptation to hand him the RBS business. It is true that the UK banking sector is in dire need of new competition, as the report commissioned by the Government from Sir John Vickers made abundantly clear. But Virgin Money is still a relatively small operation with just 75 branches. With Northern Rock, it acquired a savings and mortgages operation, not a full-scale high street bank. For it to take on the RBS branches would be like a sprat trying to swallow a whale. The evidence so far suggests that Virgin Money would not necessarily offer consumer-friendly banking. The group climbed down on plans for a compulsory £60 a year fee on a current account it is designing under its own steam, but only after intervention by the Mail. It is too early to predict whether Branson will succeed in an audacious attempt to sweep up the RBS branches. But those unfortunate customers have already endured the exploits of Fred Goodwin and the IT meltdown that paralysed millions of accounts earlier this year. Surely they have suffered enough.","Billionaire's Virgin Money thought to have £650million budget for bid .

"The 35-year-old truck driver had suffered a massive heart attack and died from caffeine toxicity . A mother is determined that no one else will have to endure the pain of their child dying from consuming too many energy drinks. Shani Clarke's son, Michael, used to drink at least four 500ml cans of Mother a day - as well as four to five cups of coffee before he was found slumped behind the wheel of the 11 tonne truck on the side of the road in Perth on January 30 this year. The 35-year-old truck driver had suffered a massive heart attack and died from caffeine toxicity. 'I can't tell you the pain I felt at that moment, my heart just hit the floor and I sobbed and sobbed,' Ms Clarke said on Facebook. Ms Clarke said she didn't realise her son was buying energy drinks until a few weeks before he died. 'He was cleaning his truck out and I saw he had an armful of the big cans of Mother and I said ""I hope your not drinking too many of them in one go"" which he just shrugged off as we mums know nothing, I didn't think much more of it at the time.' Scroll down for video . Michael Clarke used to drink at least four 500ml cans of Mother a day - as well as four to five cups of coffee before he was found slumped behind the wheel of the 11 tonne truck in Perth on January 30 this year . Ms Clarke decided to educate others on the possible perils of consuming too many energy drinks through the Facebook page - Caffeine Toxicity Death Awareness . The Facebook campaign has taken of with almost 500 members joining the cause . It wasn't until last month when the coroner told her how her son had died that she decided to educate others on the possible perils of consuming too many energy drinks through the Facebook page - Caffeine Toxicity Death Awareness. • Energy drinks are not made available in     primary nor secondary schools . • Marketing and advertising activities of energy drinks are not directed at children . • No promotional activities are undertaken that encourage excessive consumption of energy drinks . • Labels of energy drinks do not promote the mixing of energy drinks with any other beverage. 'I was so angry when I found out it was caffeine as I had lost my first born and it could have been avoided if he hadn't drank so many of these drinks without a break,' she said in the post. 'His body couldn't process the caffeine anymore and it built up in his body and it caused a massive heart attack.' Ms Clarke has received an overwhelming response since starting the page with many admitting they didn't realise the possible dangers and some have even given up the drinks. One lady admitted to being addicted to cans of V for almost a decade. 'Today starts my sugar free September. And good bye v forever! I'm doing it cause I was unaware of this. It's hit to close to home. Not taking any chances.' While another posted that she was unaware of the dangers of energy drinks. 'I drink coffee in the morning and two energy drinks a day. I'm a truck driver, and I'm not quite sure what I'll do without those energy drinks, but I'm sure gonna try not to drink them anymore!' A lot of people have decided to quit the energy drinks after learning Michael's fate . Ms Clarke said she didn't realise Michael was buying energy drinks until a few weeks before he died . The avoidable death has also prompted experts to speak about the dangers of the energy drink. Chair of general practitioners for the Australian Medical Association, Dr Brian Morton warned that people should not consume more than the equivalent of a total of two cups of coffee per day. 'The body is just not made to take that sheer capacity of toxic levels of chemicals' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'The quantity that you have and the amount of caffeine you drink as a consequence will absorb into your body which can be quite significant such as a toxic effect,' he said. 'It can unmask electrical abnormalities in the heart for example that you are born with - it is a short circuit in the electrical wiring that can cause sudden death.' While WA Health's deputy chief health officer Andy Robertson told the ABC it was recommended not to consume more than 400 milligrams of caffeine a day - a  500ml can of a typical energy drink carries about 160mg. Meanwhile, Australian Beverages Council CEO Geoff Parker said the Australian energy drinks market is one of the most regulated in the world. 'Products across the category are clearly labelled with a 500ml daily usage maximum,' he said . 'Australia’s strict regulations, in addition to a cap on the caffeine content, equivalent to an instant cup of coffee for a 250mL can (80mg), make our energy drink regulations the tightest in the world,'","Michael Clarke died from consuming too many energy drinks .

"Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany has signed a new five-year contract with the Premier League champions. News of Kompany's deal, which is understood to be worth £130,000-a-week, comes just 24 hours after David Silva also committed his future to the club until 2019. The inspirational Belgium defender has led City to the Premier League title twice in the last three years, as well as lifting the FA Cup and Capital One Cup. And Kompany, 28, has set himself a target of adding another three titles before he leaves the Etihad. 'If you win the Premier League once, you either stop there or you want to carry on and go and win 10,' he said. 'Ten is not going to happen for me, but that's the path that I've chosen. VIDEO Scroll down for Manchester City's Vincent Kompany wants the quadruple . New deal: Vincent Kompany has signed a five-year deal with the Premier League champions . 'I'm not happy with one or two. I want more. I want to be able to look back in my career and say that I won four or five at City. It's a tough ask, particularly when you know how difficult the league is. But it's something I'm ready to fight for every day. 'You won't see me retiring happy if at the end of my career I say I've only won two titles. Maybe five years ago that's the best I could have hoped for but now we want more. At the same time we shouldn't forget where we've come from.' The Champions League is the next step for Manuel Pellegrini's team, and Kompany believes the current squad can become City legends by turning the club into genuine European heavyweights. 'I do know we are just at the start,' he added. 'Whoever has been building from the start will have a special place, I do know that. Contract: The Manchester City captain will receive £130,000 a week from Manchester City . 'You look around the whole club and there are signs of it being a great club to be at. We are looking to be one of the big clubs in Europe. We'll never have the history of some of those other clubs, but what I can do is build a future for us, which is just as bright if not brighter than any other club. That's the target. 'If we can keep a little bit of that in our passion, our way of dealing with the Premier League and everything we do here I think we'll be a pretty special club. 'More and more big players want to be here as well as they can see the potential and the future for this club. 'The Champions League is a big target for us. We felt last year there was not too much difference between us and the top sides. Champion: Kompany has won two Premier League titles, one FA Cup and one League Cup with City . 'We all know there are three or four sides who are a little bit above the rest. But that's the work we are doing here on the training ground, trying to bridge the gap and then trying to become stronger. It's a tough ask and it will take time but that's what we are trying to do.' Kompany still had four years left on his current contract but City have been anxious to reward their key performers and tie them down to new deals. Silva, Samir Nasri and Aleksandar Kolarov have all re-signed in recent months and Sergio Aguero and Joe Hart are expected to be next. The City skipper admitted that he did not need any persuading to commit the rest of his top-flight career to the club. 'To be honest I didn't have to think twice about it,' he said. 'It's just about continuity for me. I've always wanted to stay at this club for a long time. Commitment: The Belgian defender has always demonstrated considerable commitment to the club . 'Looking to the future I can see the potential – to be part of the history we've built together. It's just a natural thing for me to stay longer here and win more trophies. 'The club wants to perform on all stages. This is the best squad I've been part of and it will keep improving. I think we'll progress this year because of how comfortable we are with the system, how comfortable we are with our style of play. That will eventually make us even stronger.' Kompany has yet to play for City in pre-season following his involvement in the World Cup, and he could only watch as the champions were beaten 3-0 by Arsenal in the Community Shield at Wembley on Sunday. Training: Kompany trains as Manchester City prepare . But he is confident City will not make the same mistake as two years ago when they won they suffered a dip in form after lifting the title and allowed Manchester United to win it back. 'The hardest thing is to win the first one,' he said. 'When it comes to retaining it, partially it's a mental thing but at the same time you get experience and you learn. In this case I feel there are a lot of red flags, alarm signals from last time, we have to be really careful not to fall into complacency. 'I'm pretty confident that's not going to happen. At the same time you have to look forward and not so much back. 'This team is stronger now than it's ever been; we have competition for places in every position and a dressing room full of exceptional, motivated people who want to continue making history together. 'Lifting two Premier League titles, the FA Cup and the Capital One Cup have been four of the best days of my life but I believe that there are many more of these occasions ahead. 'There are so many new landmarks and records to chase and I hope signing this new contract is taken as a statement of intent that I want to keep fighting for trophies for this special club.'","Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany has signed a new contract .

"A boat carrying eight sections of the 458-foot antenna that will potentially make One World Trade Center the nation’s tallest building is finally en route to New York from Canada via the Atlantic seaboard. The Atlantic Salvor barge is expected to arrive in Port Newark next week following a 1,500-mile journey. Once in New Jersey, the spires will be transferred to Manhattan. Delivery of the antenna had been in jeopardy due to a legal dispute between the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey and Canadian manufacturer ADF Steel that was eventually resolved last month. Precious cargo: The Atlantic Salvor barge is carrying eight sections of the world trade center's 458-foot antenna from Canada to New York . Under construction: The trade center's director of construction, Steven Plate, says the spire marks a post 9/11 milestone that signifies New York City is 'better than ever' In a lawsuit filed at the New York Supreme Court, the Port Authority accused ADF of holding the antenna ‘hostage’ in a bid to receive $6 million it claimed it was owed from another WTC-related project. There was a race against time to resolve the dispute before the onset of winter that could have delayed delivery of the antenna until next spring at the earliest. Typically the St. Lawrence river freezes during the winter and if ADF hadn’t shipped the giant antenna parts by December, delivery would probably have been delayed and the March completion date of the tower would have been at risk. That would have had serious implications for the scheduled opening of One World Trade Center and  would also have resulted in the layoff of 100 iron workers who will construct the antenna from the 18 separate segments. The barge left Valleyfield, Quebec, last Friday loaded with the eight largest sections which range from five to 67 tons. The remaining 10 smaller sections are being transported via road. Once these separate elements have been welded together the 458-foot antenna, which has cost $10 million and weighs 750 ton, will be placed on top of the soon to be completed WTC building. The Atlantic Salvor barge made a 1,500-mile journey from Valleyfield, Quebec carrying the antennae pieces . Beacon of hope: One World Trade Center - the lit-up building on the left - is currently New York City's tallest skyscraper . The antenna, designed in collaboration with artist Kenneth Snelson, is part of the tower’s 'crown' and will allow the building to reach a symbolic height of 1,776 feet, a nod to the year the U.S. declared its independence from Great Britain. The skyscraper is intended to serve as a ‘symbol of recovery’ after the original towers, which collapsed during the 2001 September 11 terrorist attacks. Once completed, One World Trade Center had been expected to formally become the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere, surpassing the Willis Tower (formerly known as the Sears Tower) in Chicago. However in May, plans were dropped to enclose the antenna with an ornamental white shell after it was claimed it would be too costly . and dangerous to maintain. As the building's spire will no longer be enclosed, it may instead have to be classified as a simple antenna which, according to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, cannot be included in a building's official height. One World Trade Center, left, is scheduled to be completed next year when it will be determined if it really is taller than the Willis Tower in Chicago . Without the inclusion of the antenna . mast, One World Trade Center's official height would be its roof height . of 1,318 feet, making it only the third-tallest building in the United . States, behind the Willis Tower and Trump International Hotel & . Tower, both located in Chicago. Even without the spire, the . still-under-construction World Trade Center has already eclipsed the . Empire State Building’s 1,250 feet to make it the tallest building in . New York. However even that record might be surpassed by the completion of 432 Park Avenue in 2016, which is expected to rise to a height of 1,379 feet. The building's developers dispute the claim that the spire should be reclassified as an antenna following the redesign, with Port Authority spokesman Steve Coleman reiterating that 'One World Trade Center will be the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere.' The CTBUH has announced it will wait to make its final decision as to whether or not the redesigned spire will count towards the building's official height until after One World Trade Center's completion next year.
