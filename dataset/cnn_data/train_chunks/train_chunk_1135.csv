"Too much, too soon? According to a group of teachers and academics, these children shouldn't be starting school until the age of six or seven and not at four or five as the system currently requires . Children should not start primary school until they are six or seven-years-old, according to a coalition of education experts who warn of the damaging pressure to perform in class at a young age. A letter written by 130 teachers, academics and authors said the UK should follow the Scandinavian model and put off formal lessons for two years. Under the UK’s current system, children start full-time schooling at the age of four or five. Experts say this is causing ‘profound damage’ in a generation which is not encouraged to learn through play. But the call was last night dismissed by as ‘misguided’ by a spokesman for the Education Secretary Michael Gove. Children in the UK are obliged by law to be in school aged five, which the lobby group said is creating a ‘too much, too soon’ culture. The warning singled out recent government proposals which mean five year olds could be formally tested from the beginning of their schooling. Under the current system, children are first assessed at the age of seven. But under Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg’s proposals, a ‘baseline’ test could be introduced in the first year of primary school. The group of experts warned that monitoring a pupil’s progress from such a young age promotes stress and fear around learning. The letter said: ‘The continued focus on an early start to formal learning is likely to cause profound damage to the self-image and learning dispositions of a generation of children’. A spokesman for Education Secretary Michael Gove said the group who wrote to the Daily Telegraph are promoting ‘bogus pop-psychology.’ Overwhelming: According to the group, starting formal lessons too early creates a fear of learning and puts too much pressure on younger children . These people represent the powerful and badly misguided lobby who are responsible for the devaluation of exams and the culture of low expectations in state schools,’ the spokesman said. Sir Al Aynsley-Green, former Children’s Commissioner and one of those to sign the letter, said countries where children start school later, see better results. He said: ‘If you look at a country like Finland, children don’t start formal, full-scale education until they are seven. Dismissive: A spokesman for Education Secretary Michael Gove's (left) office described the calls as 'misguided', while Nick Clegg (right) has suggested 'baseline' tests for children in the first year of primary school . ‘These extra few years, in my view, provide a crucial opportunity, when supported by well trained, well paid and highly educated staff, for children to be children’. Other signatories of the letter include Lord Layard, director of the Well-Being Programme at the London School of Economics, Dr David Whitebread, senior lecturer in psychology of education at Cambridge University, and Catherine Prisk, director of Play England. The Telegraph said the letter was circulated by the Save Childhood Movement, which will launch its Too Much, Too Soon campaign tomorrow. It will reportedly call for reforms including play-based schooling for children between three and seven.Wendy Ellyatt, the founding director of the movement, told the newspaper: 'Despite the fact that 90 per cent of countries in the world prioritise social and emotional learning and start formal schooling at six or seven, in England we seem grimly determined to cling on to the erroneous belief that starting sooner means better results later. 'There is nothing wrong with seeking high educational standards and accountability, but there is surely something very wrong indeed if this comes at the cost of natural development.' Outspoken: Former Children's Commissioner Professor Al Aynsley-Green was one of those to sign the letter .","130 teachers and academics call for schooling to be delayed by two years .

He did not give a specific date for the trip, saying it was being arranged on 'relatively short notice'. Scroll down for video . Unhappy: Merkel suggested at an EU gathering that she was not placated by talks with President Obama . News of the talks signals an escalation in the diplomatic tensions between America and her allies after it was claimed the NSA had monitored the calls of 35 world leaders.

"Magnus Carlsen has become the highest-rated chess player in history . He's been making all the right moves in the world of chess since the age of five and now Norwegian sensation Magnus Carlsen has become the game's highest-rated player ever. The 22-year-old world number one has finally surpassed legendary Russian grandmaster Gary Kasparov's 12-year-old tally to be earn the prestigious accolade. Known as the 'Mozart of chess' for the raw ability he demonstrated from a young age, Carlsen achieved his goal by defeating English player Luke McShane at the London Chess Classic this week. Kasparov had previously claimed that his record rating of 2,851 was impossible to beat, but with victory over McShane, Carlsen nudged his own total to 2,857.4 points. In typically understated fashion Carlsen, who has been world number one since he took the crown at the age of 19, said his win over McShane was a 'great start to the tournament' and he was satisfied with the record. Ratings are determined through performance and they predict how likely a player is to beat a rival. Points are allocated accordingly. Carlsen's manager Espen Agdestein said he didn't anticipate his client would be devoting any time to enjoying a few glasses of champagne to celebrate the landmark because he was 'a bit boring in that regard'. The part-time model reportedly picks up a cool £933,000 a year from chess having developed a passion for the game when his father taught him how to play at the age of five. Carlsen, right, achieved his dream of becoming the best rated player in the world after beating Luke McShane from England . Carlsen pictured as a 13-year-old participating in the Dubai Open chess tournament. He developed a passion for the game from a young age. Carlsen overtook Gary Kasparov's 12-year-old ratings record when he amassed 2,857.4 points . Carlsen says his first goal in the game . was to beat his sister, then his father. He progressed quickly and . became an International grandmaster at the age of 13, the youngest at . the time. In October 2009, during the Nanjing Pearl Spring tournament, he became the fifth chess player in the history to achieve an Elo-rating over 2800 – by far the youngest to do so. That year he also became The World Blitz Chess champion. In 2009 he took on 'The World' in a game of chess. Hikaru Nakamura (U.S.), Maxime Vachier-Lagrave (France) and Judit Polgar (Hungary) made suggestions to a live vote on the internet . On paper, The World had a reasonable chance, but with three players advising it's difficult to form a coherent plan. In a King's Indian defence Carlsen could have won in a mundane way, but instead he finished in striking fashion, his passed pawns on the queenside proving unstoppable. Carlsen started his recent game over McShane with the in-vogue Berlin defence and McShane went for a symmetrical set up that gave him a slight advantage when the middle game arrived. Not one to shy away from complexities, Carlsen created chances for himself in the queen and minor piece endgame after coming back from the jaws of defeat. He avenged a loss at the hands of McShane in 2010 at the same venue.","Norwegian sensation took up chess at the age of five and became world number one by the time he was 19 .

"The dramatic moment two planes almost collided on a runway in Barcelona has been captured on camera. The footage reveals the near-miss between a Boeing 767 from Russian airline Utair and an Aerolineas Argentinas Airbus A340 at El Prat Airport in Spain. It shows the Boeing coming in to land on the runway, making its final approach, as the Airbus, getting ready for a flight to Buenos Aires, taxis across its path. Scroll down for video . Dramatic footage: The video shows the moment a aircraft was forced to abort its landing after another plane taxis across its path at Barcelona airport . The Boeing is forced to abort the landing, with the pilot carrying out an emergency 'go-around' procedure. The jet, which had travelled from Russia, landed safely shortly afterwards. The heart-stopping incident, which occurred on Saturday, was caught on camera by Miguel Angel, who posted the video to YouTube, where it has already been viewed more than one million times. Angel, who has posted hundreds of plane videos online, said seeing the near-miss was 'one of the worst experiences I have ever had'. 'Worst experiences ever': The Boeing 767 comes into land at the airport as the Airbus taxis across the runway . 'Go-around': The Boeing pilot is forced to abort the landing, pulling up and going around the other plane . He explained: 'An Utair Boeing 767-300 (VQ-BSX) incoming from Moscow as UT5187 and Aerolíneas Argentinas Airbus A340-300 (LV-FPV) were involved into what could be the bigger disaster of Barcelona Airport. 'The Utair 767 was about to land on Runway 02 while the Argentinas was crossing the runway. 'By the time russian pilots sight Argentinas (they were taxiing to Holding point of RW25R for take-off) on runway while they were on final approach, they did their best making an impressive and close go around. 'After that incidence the plane landed safely on runway 02, and the Argentinas took-off heading Buenos Aires.' [sic] . Safe landing: The Boeing 767 from Russian airline Utair lands after the near-miss at Barcelona airport . Captain John Holmes, flight training manager at Ansett Aviation Training told www.smh.com.au there were three possible explanations for the error. 'The instructions to the A340 possibly were misunderstood by the captain, or they might not have heard or acknowledged the instructions, or there may have been no instruction issued from the control tower,' he said. Spanish Airports and Air Navigation (AENA), the public body responsible for airports in Spain, released a statement saying there was never any danger of a collision as there was sufficient space to carry out a landing between the two planes. It comes just days after two planes narrowly averted a midair crash near the Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston. A Singapore Airlines Boeing 777 aircraft takes off from Changi airport in Singapore in 2011. A similar passenger plane nearly collided with another aircraft on Thursday in the skies over Houston . A Singapore Airlines jumbo 777 flew within 200 feet vertically and about a half-mile horizontally - about eight football fields - of a Delta Air Lines A320 just before 7pm on Thursday. Air traffic controllers caught the error and corrected the planes' courses before they got any closer. The incident took place about 10 miles northeast of the airport. The Federal Aviation Administration, which requires aircraft to remain separated at least a half-mile vertically and three miles horizontally, is investigating the incident, the Houston Chronicle reported.","Boeing 767 and Airbus A340 involved in the near-miss in Spain .

"California prosecutors have declined to file charges against a sheriff's deputy who struck and killed a prominent entertainment attorney and former Napster executive with his patrol car last year. Deputy Andrew Wood was apparently distracted by his mobile digital computer when his patrol car drifted into the bike lane, running over cyclist Milton Olin Jr. Olin, a 65-year-old attorney and former chief operating officer of the online file-sharing service Napster, was riding in Calabasas in December when he was hit. No charges: California prosecutors have declined to charge a sheriff's deputy who struck and killed prominent attorney and former Napster executive Milton Olin Jr (pictured left and right) Tragic: Olin's bicycle can be seen beneath the tires of the deputy's car in Calabasas December 8, 2013 . Prosecutors said in a letter released Wednesday and cited by Los Angeles Daily News that because Wood was acting within the course of his duties when typing into his computer, criminal charges are not warranted. Under the law, law enforcement officials are allowed to use electronic wireless devices while carrying out their duties. The victim’s family have filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the Sheriff's Department and accused Wood of negligence. Olin’s loved ones also started an online petition on Change.org demanding that charges be brought against the deputy. So far, more than 67,000 people have signed. Milton Olin, a married father of two, was riding his bike in the 22400 block of Mulholland Highway at around 1pm on December 8, 2013, when Deputy Wood's patrol car slammed into him. Struck: A shoe can be seen near the bike lane where Olin was cycling when he was hit . Olin's loved ones have started a petition demanding that charges be brought against the distracted deputy who killed him while texting behind the wheel . Olin was pronounced dead at the scene and the deputy was taken to a hospital for treatment of minor injuries. Wood was returning from a fire call at Calabasas High School and was on patrol when the accident occurred. ‘He was responding to a deputy who was inquiring whether the fire investigation had been completed,’ the letter from the prosecutor’s office stated. ‘Since Wood was acting within the course and scope of his duties when he began to type his response, under Vehicle Code section 23123.5, he acted lawfully. ‘Wood briefly took his eyes away from the road precisely when the narrow roadway curved slightly to the left without prior warning, causing him to inadvertently travel straight into the bike lane, immediately striking Olin.’ Olin, from Woodland Hills, had been a lawyer for 38 years and practiced business, labor and employment and intellectual property law from a firm he co-founded, Altschul & Olin LLC in Encino. Clan: Olin is survived by his wife, Louise, far right and their two sons, who have filed a wrongful death lawsuit . Happier times: Olin, pictured left as a young father and right with his wife, Louise Olin, years before the tragedy . Dazzling career: Olin was previously the chief of operations at Napster (pictured) and a prominent lawyer . According to his LinkedIn profile, he was the COO of Napster between 2000 and 2002. Napster was a file sharing site for music before becoming an online music store. Before his job with Napster, he worked for A&M Records as vice president of business development and was responsible for signing artists and acquiring music rights. Olin is survived by his wife, Louise, and his two sons, Chris and Geoff. The family lived in a $1million home in Woodland Hills.

"The details were visceral, like the shock of the news. Phillip Hughes suffered a vertebral artery dissection. The impact of the ball on the back of his head had been immense, compressing the vessel and causing it to split. The resulting cerebral haemorrhage was described as catastrophic, a massive bleed in his brain. An operation removed part of his skull to alleviate the pressure. Hope began to fade. Hughes never awoke, having lapsed into unconsciousness soon after the fatal blow. He was pronounced dead 48 hours later, surrounded by family, friends and crying men who play games, much like him. Remember those details the next time sellers of apparel inform you that impossible is nothing, or that the man in the arena is a superhuman. Impossible is something. Impossible is what the sadly human Hughes encountered, in that moment when an alignment of circumstances too random to be repeated began the process that would end his life. Phillip Hughes poses in front of the Australian flag with his tragic death sending tremors across the world . Hughes lost his life three days short of his 26th birthday to leave the cricketing world in a state of shock . The Queen shakes hands with Hughes at Lord's during last year's Ashes series . Those events, the terrible misfortune at every stage, bear revisiting. Hughes’s death required a bouncing ball to be delivered by bowler Sean Abbott, not exceptionally fast, but slightly too slow. It required Hughes to marginally misjudge the pace of that ball, or perhaps for it to stick a fraction longer on the surface than usual, causing him to mistime his shot and play early. It required Hughes to have chosen to hook in answer to Abbott’s delivery, meaning the swing of his bat and his body turned his head around, so that the back, the part unprotected by his helmet, was exposed to impact. And it required the ball to strike him in a defenceless area, with sufficient force to cause a fatal rupture. It was as if bad luck decided to hold a party on the square at the SCG and invite all of its most unruly friends. Hughes lost his life after the back of his head was struck by Sean Abbott's bouncer . Abbott (centre) is consoled by former Australian opener Simon Katich outside Sydney's St Vincent's Hospital . David Warner (left) and Australia captain Michael Clarke arrive at the SCG after news of Hughes' death . Hughes was an opening batsman, those kings of one against 11. He is used to overcoming sport’s probabilities. Yet the odds he faced this week were insurmountable. And that brings the shock; because we are used to seeing our sportsmen as invulnerable. Yes, they lose, that is the nature of the beast; but not like this. They lose Tests, matches, games, races, sets, frames, fixtures, not lives. We revel in their indomitable nature, tell stories of their heroism and defiance, indulge their myths and legends. We pretend, too, that impossible is nothing: but only for them. While cricket mourns, perhaps the most lurid tales will abate; but not for long. Soon enough, we will return to inherited memories of men like Brian Close who, fable informs, liked nothing more than a cricket ball to the noggin. In 1966, England captain for the final Test against the West Indies, he fielded in the silliest of silly point positions in the days before protective helmets. Close was so near to the prolific batsman, Garry Sobers, that even his team-mates feared for his safety. ‘What if you’re hit on the head?’ they asked. ‘He’ll be caught at cover off the rebound,’ Close explained. Probably. Brian Close, who famously shunned a helmet at the crease, is hit on the shoulder by Andy Roberts' bouncer . A bruised Close shows off some battle scars after facing the fabled West Indies attack in 1976 . Like much of sport’s folklore, who knows what was really said, or done? A cricket ball is still a cricket ball, a skull is still a skull, even in sport’s good old days. It is unlikely that Close, more than any man, could have taken savage impact at point-blank range and remained unharmed. It is unlikely he was struck as often as we are led to believe, either. Yet it suits us all to invest, to pretend, to mythologise this world of hard men, playing the game at the limit of endurance, surviving blows that would fell lesser mortals. Hughes is the collateral damage of this delusion; so was Ayrton Senna; so, too, Johnny Owen. But we wouldn’t have it any other way, even now. ‘Should the ball be softer?’ earnest reporters asked the cricket fraternity. They will not find one supporter for more health and safety measures, even in the school game. We have never left the Roman arena in the way we consider many sports, and the ferocious battle between a truly fast bowler and an opening batsman such as Hughes is the essence of cricket. During the Ashes tour last winter, the feral atmosphere subsided, the disappointment palpable, whenever Mitchell Johnson wasn’t bowling. The roar as he ran in, Australia’s own little Colosseum. England could not handle Mitchell Johnson's pace and devastating short ball in the last Ashes series . With the partisan crowd behind him in Australia, Johnson wreaked havoc with England's batsmen . It is the loneliest position in team sport, opening batsman. The ball is at its newest, the bowler at his freshest, his team-mates crowd in, a gang of childish bullies, sharp-tongued and safe in numbers. The batsman is alone. He has a partner at the opposite end, but nobody is paying attention to him. They are all focused on one man. The kicker in rugby has a solitary role so, too, football’s penalty taker. Yet, on the pitch at least, in those moments there is calm. No physical challenge is offered, or expected. By contrast, the batsman is under threat of harm throughout his intense ordeal. He sees the bowler gathering steam on his run, he senses the desire for his downfall from the field, he is aware of the expectancy from all sides, his importance to the victory: and he knows what is coming. ‘Get ready for a broken arm,’ Michael Clarke told James Anderson, as he prepared to face Johnson last winter. Clarke, Australia’s captain, wept for the loss of his friend Hughes. He would have settled for a bulletin about a boring old fractured radius, no doubt, but it was too late for bargains. A distraught Clarke pauses before delivering a statement on behalf of the Hughes family . Clarke indulges in some finger-wagging with James Anderson (right) during the last Ashes series . Were fielders needling Hughes in that manner on the day he faced his final ball? Probably. They didn’t mean harm and wouldn’t have thought anything of it. Sledging will not end with this tragedy. Time will pass and batsmen will start getting told they are going to leave in an ambulance again. It is part of the game; just another obstacle for the superhumans to overcome; another challenge to be faced down. And Clarke is a batsman. Whatever he said to Anderson will have been said to him, too, in various forms. It goes around. There is no openers’ club. I have sat with former England batsmen as they have laughed like drains at footage of one of their number being beaten up by the fastest bowlers on earth. They love it. We all do. Abbott was not intending to hurt Hughes when he unleashed a bouncer that day and if it had struck him with less morbid consequences, men now wiping away tears of sadness might be crying with laughter at the slow-motion replays or cracking wise on social networks. All’s well that ends well. The perils of facing Lillee, Thomson or the Fire In Babylon-era West Indies bowlers are an after-dinner staple for many speakers on the cricket circuit. The death of Hughes rather puts a crimp in that casual fun. It would be a brave man to expect a laugh tonight, retelling the story of Bumble getting hit in the Y-fronts by Jeff Thomson. Suddenly, it is all too real: Hughes makes us realise the shallowness of our presumptions that everything is possible if we simply want it enough. Senna died. So, too, Marc-Vivien Foe. Jeff Thomson (left) and Dennis Lillee regularly left a devastating trail of destruction in their wake . Johnny Owen (left) lost his life seven weeks after his fight with Lupe Pintor in 1980 . Marc-Viven Foe (left) died during 2003's Confederations Cup, while Ayrton Senna lost his life at Monza in 1994 . VIDEO World mourns Hughes after tragic death . There have been four previous deaths in first-class cricket, going back to 1870. The fact we can name individuals suggests there is no widespread problem. Cricket would be greatly safer than do-it-yourself, for instance. Yet deaths in play, as rare as they may be, hit harder than a tumble from the shed roof. Athletes are the fittest of the fit, the best of the best. We use their commitment and dedication to set our standards, to provide our role models. We want our sons and daughters to stand up to bouncers, to ride challenges, to run marathons. We want them to be little rippers like Hughes. Most weeks, he would beat those odds of one against 11. To open the innings for his country, Hughes was plainly very adept at facing up to this unique challenge. He had worked all his life to be there. He thrived on it. His mother and his sister were watching as he prepared to face that last delivery. He didn’t know it was coming, neither did they and neither did we. Still, once the tears subside, the old con will continue. Just do it. Refuse to lose. Impossible is nothing. A hit to the head, it makes no difference. The superhumans can take it. They love it. Did you hear the one about Brian Close? Oh, the stories. One day, we’ll look back again and laugh. Maybe not today.","Hughes's death required a bouncing ball to be delivered by bowler Sean Abbott, not exceptionally fast, but slightly too slow .

"President Barack Obama caught a pregnant woman who began to faint during his speech about healthcare reforms today and then joked: 'That's what happens when I talk too long.' Mr Obama reached out to help prospective Affordable Care Act beneficiary Karmel Allison who was standing directly behind him as he discussed the glitches of the new healthcare website in the Rose Garden of the White House. Around 25 minutes into the speech, Ms Allison became unsteady and started to lose consciousness but the President, and other attendees, turned around and grabbed her before she fainted.

Shaky: Allison, in red, looks visibly woozy as she grips the hand of the woman next to her and the President dives to help her during an event in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, on Monday . Diabetes: Allison, center, was invited to the event because she has suffered diabetes since age 9 and struggled to get affordable health cover . 'I got you. You're OK,' Mr Obama told her. The woman was escorted away for medical assistance as the crowd applauded Mr Obama's quick reaction. Ms Allison later tweeted: 'I'm ok world- just got a little lightheaded.Thanks, @BarackObama for catching me! And good thing this pregnant diabetic is pregnant :)' Her husband, David Allison, tweeted his thanks to Mr Obama then in a follow up said he had wanted to go to his wife's aid but thought better of it, fearing the Secret Service may get confused if he started bolting towards the podium. Ms Allison was invited to the event at the White House because she has suffered Type 1 Diabetes since she was nine years old and has always struggled to find affordable healthcare. She said she was lucky to have insurance already when she was diagnosed and stayed on the same plan, despite constantly rising costs, because she was scared another insurer would reject her due to her pre-existing condition. She said she recently began . researching her options on CoveredCA and was elated to find she could now qualify for low-cost insurance despite her diabetes. She said she finally feels equal to others, including her healthy husband, when it . comes to accessing coverage. A few hours after her turn, she told CNN she was 'feeling much better' and that she thought dehydration may have caused her to feel lightheaded during the event. 'I'm 20 weeks pregnant at this point and I hadn't had that much to drink that morning because I was worried about possibly needing to go to the bathroom during the speech,' she said in a phone interview. 'And as the sun hit me, I got a little lightheaded.' Ms Allison said she was treated by the White House physician. 'Now I get to say that ACA got me care by the White House medical professional,' she joked. Before the hammer fell: In a Rose Garden speech, just the pictured pregnant woman famously fell, Obama called Sanford's story, which she emailed to the White House, 'what the Affordable Care Act is all about' Just in time: The President turns around and catches Allison just as she's about to faint, and the man standing behind her grabs her shoulders . Help: Allison is then escorted away. She later tweeted that she was feeling OK now and thanked Mr Obama . Ms Allison, who represented the American Diabetes Association, said she was honored to attend the event. 'It was an honor to be there and I'm rather sorry I fainted in the middle of the speech, but I was really happy to be able to be on stage at that moment,' she told CNN. According to a biography on website A Sweet Life, to which she contributes as science editor, Ms Allison was born in Southern California, and went to UC Berkeley graduating in 2006 with a B.A. in Linguistics. She now lives with her husband in San Diego where she works in computational . biology at the University of California. Michael is chief technology officer and co-founder at Nulu and founder and chief technology officer at Minute7.com. The couple also have a computer company, Arcaio Inc. She writes in her biography that she 'is loving the sunshine (in San Deigo) ... and learning to use . the active voice when talking about her diabetes.' In her spare time, she says she enjoys 'people, Milan Kundera, rock climbing, and the pursuit of . life, liberty, and happiness.' However, it didn't take long before skeptics started suggesting the health scare was a fake and Ms Allison was planted there by the Obama administration. But her husband insisted the near-collapse was no fake. Ms Allison became dizzy towards the end . of a defiant speech during which Mr Obama said he was mad about problems . with the new health care website, but argued that the Affordable Care . Act as a whole is working as planned. While Healthcare.gov 'hasn't worked . as smoothly as it was supposed to work,' Obama said during the White . House speech that once-uninsured Americans have signed up for coverage . and are receiving benefits, 'The product -- the health insurance -- is good,' Mr Obama said. 'The prices are good. It is a good deal.' Feeling better: Ms Allison, pictured here in 2012, has suffered diabetes since she was 9 and is a major advocate of the ACA . Couple: Her husband Michael Allison, pictured with her, tweeted that he almost went to her aid on stage but thought the Secret Service might get confused . Facing . attacks from Republicans and other critics of Obamacare, the president . said his health care team is reaching out to tech experts to help fix . massive website problems that have hampered the rollout of his landmark . piece of legislation. 'Nobody's madder than me about the fact that the website isn't working as well as it should,' Mr Obama said, 'which means it's going to get fixed.' Aside from the website, Mr Obama said the new health care law is providing consumer protections and benefits for millions of Americans, including mammograms and birth control services. He told stories of now-covered Americans who had once been denied insurance because of pre-existing conditions. 'The essence of the law, the health insurance that's available to people, is working just fine,' Mr Obama said.

"The United States may have bugged Angela Merkel's phone for more than 10 years, according to a news report on Saturday that also said President Barack Obama told the German leader he would have stopped it happening had he known about it. Germany's outrage over reports of bugging of Merkel's phone by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) prompted it to summon the U.S. ambassador this week for the first time in living memory, an unprecedented post-war diplomatic rift. Der Spiegel said Merkel's mobile telephone had been listed by the NSA's Special Collection Service (SCS) since 2002 - marked as ""GE Chancellor Merkel"" - and was still on the list weeks before Obama visited Berlin in Jun . Scroll down for video... Unhappy: Merkel suggested at an EU gathering that she was not placated by talks with President Obama . In an SCS document cited by the magazine, the agency said it had a 'not legally registered spying branch' in the U.S. embassy in Berlin, the exposure of which would lead to 'grave damage for the relations of the United States to another government'. From there, NSA and CIA staff were tapping communication in the Berlin's government district with high-tech surveillance. Quoting a secret document from 2010, Der Spiegel said such branches existed in about 80 locations around the world, including Paris, Madrid, Rome, Prague, Geneva and Frankfurt. The magazine said it was not clear whether the SCS had recorded conversations or just connection data. Anger: German Chancellor Angela Merkel (left) and Brazil's Dilma Rousseff (right) have both voiced concerns over the NSA's infiltration of the online communications of foreigners . Obama apologized to Merkel when she called him on Wednesday to seek clarification on the issue, Der Spiegel wrote, citing a source in Merkel's office. Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung also said Obama had told Merkel he had not known of the bugging. Merkel's spokesman and the White House declined comment.

However, it’s doubtful, even at their age, that the royal couple could contemplate a retirement of leisurely travel.

"A gay wedding at the British ambassador's residence in Beijing at the weekend has sparked outrage in China. Wearing matching slippers and bow ties, Brian Davidson, 50, Britain's consul-general in Shanghai, married his 33-year-old American boyfriend Scott Chang on the lawn of the home of Ambassador Sir Sebastian Wood. New rules mean that British nationals in homosexual relationships can marry in British consulates in 24 countries around the world as the land where the building stands is technically British soil. Scroll down for video . Britain's consul-general in Shanghai Brian Davidson (left) married his American boyfriend Scott Chang (right)  at the British ambassador's residence in Beijing at the weekend . However, whilst the ambassador posted a picture of himself and the couple on Sina Weibo, a Chinese equivalent of Twitter, holding a red card bearing the legend 'Keep calm and marry on', not everyone was as happy. 'That country is clearly sick. It's like the last days of Rome,' one person wrote in an online comment. 'I respect foreign gay culture. But it's not Chinese culture. Please respect that,' wrote another. A third suggested that same-sex unions threaten family ethics and destabilise society. Some said that the two men had 'mental illness' and that their children would have 'personality issues'. Mr Davidson boasts about his good news on Sina Weibo, a Chinese equivalent of Twitter, followed by good wishes from Ambassador Sebastian Wood - 'Keep Calm and Marry on!' Brian Davidson hails from Northern Ireland and has worked as Consul-General in Shanghai since January 2011. He was previously Consul-General in Guangzhou from October 2006. He said that he was surprised at the response to his posting on Sina Weibo: 'The scale of the coverage has been a bit daunting but it has mostly been very positive.' A spokesman for Britain's embassy in Beijing confirmed to Agence France-Presse that the wedding had taken place, but said that the couple viewed it as a 'private matter'. Attitudes to homosexuality in China is mixed and, as in most countries, it is in the bigger cities were people are more relaxed. Gay relationships are not illegal in China but same-sex couples are not recognised as such and homosexuals face widespread stigma. China has not lodged a protest although Hong Kong, the former British colony, has made it clear that same-sex marriages will not be tolerated there.","Marriage is first high-profile same-sex marriage conducted by a foreign diplomatic mission in China .

"Gold touch: Wesley Carrington (in white) found a hoard of Roman gold coins worth £100,000 20 minutes into his first treasure hunt . It's always nice to encounter a little beginners’ luck when you’re trying out a new hobby. But if the phenomenon strikes on your inaugural treasure hunt, it can mean a significant payday. Wesley Carrington was just 20 minutes into his first metal detecting trip when he unearthed a hoard of Roman gold coins estimated to be worth £100,000. Yesterday he jokingly suggested he may have ‘peaked early’ in his treasure hunting career. The novice revealed he had bought a basic detector from a local shop and headed straight out to woods to try his new gadget. His initial finds included a spoon and halfpenny piece but then the machine started bleeping to indicate metal some way beneath  the ground. After digging down around seven inches he unearthed the first of 55 ‘solidi’ – gold coins – dating back more than 1,600 years. Stunned experts later returned to the site and discovered a further 104 coins, describing the haul as ‘spectacular’ and of ‘national significance’. The remarkable story behind  the find emerged yesterday at a formal inquest which was held  to decide if the coins qualified  as ‘treasure trove’. Hertfordshire Coroner Edward Thomas ruled that they did and the coins will now be sent to the British Museum for a formal valuation before they go up for auction. Any proceeds made could be split between Mr Carrington and the owner of the land where the find was made. Mr Carrington revealed he had exposed the treasure by copying techniques he had seen on a clip on YouTube. He told the inquest in Hatfield: ‘I’ve never been metal detecting before. I just thought I would give it a go.’ He said he bought the cheapest detector he could find and then headed to the local woodland near St Albans in Hertfordshire. ‘I would say after about 20 minutes it beeped,’ he said. ‘I dug a hole. I’ve watched a couple of YouTube clips to see how you do it. ‘I dug up a bit of ground and started breaking it up. I found a coin that was gold-coloured, with a Roman figure on it. I knew what it was but I didn’t realise the significance of it.’ He then found two together and as he carried on searching he reached a total of 55. ‘When they all started coming out it sort of merged into a blur,’ he said. Lucky find: Mr Carrington discovered a hoard of solid-gold Solidi dating back nearly 1,700 years to the decline of the Roman Empire . Gobsmacked: David Sewell, who runs the Hidden History shop where Mr Carrington bought the Garrett Ace 150 (held in picture) he used to find the buried treasure . He only stopped searching the site because it was getting dark. Days later he returned to the shop where he had bought the £135 Garrett Ace 150 machine. He said shop owner David Sewell and . business partner Mark Becher were ‘gobsmacked’ when he showed them the . coins and asked them what he should do with them. They contacted the local council’s . museum service and the shop owners, a local volunteer and museum and . archaeology staff went to the site with a digger and resumed the search, . finding even more coins. Ancient: After Mr Carrington reported his amazing find, stunned experts returned to the woodland site near St Albans, Hertfordshire, and dug out a further 104 coins . The Old Court House in Hatfield: A coroner has decided the hoard qualifies as treasure, paving the way for the British Museum's valuation committee to determine exactly how much they are worth . Examination of the coins revealed . they spanned the reigns of five or six Roman emperors, from Honorius to . Gratian, and had been minted across different parts of Europe, including . modern-day Italy, Germany, France, Turkey  and Greece. Julian Watters, the finds liaison . officer for Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire, said: ‘I’ve been in the job . for ten years and it is certainly the most spectacular find. ‘I don’t know what the odds would be . of this happening. Just to put it in context, I had only previously seen . four Roman gold coins out of 50,000 finds.’ Mr Carrington said he has since joined a metal-detecting club and been out with his detector again but had not found anything.","Wesley Carrington found 55 solidi in woods near St Albans, Hertfordshire .

"Defiant: Prime Minister David Cameron insisted he would continue with plans to reduce the deficit in spite of a huge spike in the number of people unemployed . The young, women working part-time and the elderly yesterday emerged as the main victims as the worst unemployment figures for 17 years were announced. Between June and August the total number of unemployed people rocketed by 114,000 – equal to about 8,800 jobs being lost every week – leaving 2.56million people out of work. As the total climbed to its highest level since 1994, in those few months a record 74,000 over-65s were pushed out of work – just weeks before new retirement rules came into force on October 1 which ban employers from getting rid of workers because of their age. Youth unemployment also rose by 74,000 to a record 991,000, raising fears it could breach the one million mark within months. This leaves more than one in five 16 to 24 year olds out of work. Part-time posts also fell by a record 175,000 in the three months to August, which has pushed unemployment rates for women up to record levels. During bitter exchanges in the House of Commons yesterday, Prime Minister David Cameron admitted that the figures from the Office for National Statistics were ‘very disappointing’, adding that the Government has to ‘do more to get our economy moving’. But he insisted the Coalition’s deficit reduction plans must not be abandoned, arguing that a U-turn would send interest rates soaring and the economy ‘into a tailspin’. Labour said the figures were ‘a day of judgment’ and called for a new economic plan to kickstart growth. Concerns at the increasing number of young people unable to get a job led Michael Saunders, an economist from the investment bank Citigroup, to say there is a ‘strong need’ for direct measures to encourage firms to take them on. Worrying trend: Young people queue outside a job centre in a stunt to publicise the record level of youth unemployment . These include lowering National . Insurance rates or cutting the national minimum wage, which was recently . increased by 15p to £6.08 an hour for those aged 21 and above and . raised 6p to £4.98 per hour for 18 to 20 year olds. Martina Milburn, of The Prince’s . Trust, added: ‘The number of unemployed young people is now almost twice . the population of Manchester. If we fail to tackle youth unemployment . now we risk losing this talent forever, which would be a tragedy.’ Tanya de Grunwald, founder of . Graduate Fog, a job-hunting website, said: ‘Every day I hear from young . people who are desperately struggling to find work. Most are searching high and low and . would take anything they were offered. More often than not, employers . don’t even bother to write and tell them they haven’t got the job.’ Experts also raised fears that bosses . employed a policy of ‘clearing the decks’ ahead of new retirement . rules. Before October 1, a boss could simply tell a worker to leave when . he or she reached retirement age, a practice which has now been banned. Chris Ball of The Age and Employment . Network, a group which campaigns for the rights of older workers, said . the figures raise ‘serious questions’ for the Government about the rule . change. He added: ‘Has the scrapping of the . default retirement age prompted employers to clear the decks ahead of . the October milestone, denying older people the chance to work and save . for longer?’ For those who have survived the . recession, the figures show that the average private sector worker got a . rise of just 1.8 per cent which, with inflation at 4.5 per cent, is the . equivalent of a pay cut. The British Chambers of Commerce warned yesterday that unemployment will keep on rising. Paul Kenny, general secretary of the GMB union, said: 'The Tories and Lib Dems' big gamble that private sector growth would create enough jobs to compensate for their cuts in public sector jobs has not come off, as the rise to 2.57 million without jobs shows. 'In the middle of the worst international recession for 80 years, the Government itself is creating unemployment, with 250,000 public sector posts already gone and still more to come. 'These posts could have been available to the 2.57 million workers now facing the despair of mass unemployment. 'Government policy is hurting but it's not working. The squandering of human talent through unemployment is a crime that will haunt future generations.' Employment Minister Chris Grayling . said: 'It is clear that we are seeing the effect of the international . economic crisis on the UK labour market. 'That's . why last week we announced the right-to-buy housing scheme to support . growth and today we are offering more support for jobseekers as . sector-based work academies come on stream, combining real training, . work experience and a guaranteed interview. 'Our . new Work Programme is now up and running and offers people who have . lost their jobs flexible, tailored support to get back into jobs and . stay there.' The Government . said it was taking steps to support growth and rebalance the economy, . including the creation of 11 new enterprise zones, designed to boost . local growth and create more than 30,000 new jobs by 2015, four annual . reductions in corporation tax, cutting the small companies rate, . expanding loan guarantees and investing in science and apprenticeships. Other figures showed that the number . of people classed as economically inactive increased by 26,000 to 9.35 . million, a rate of 23.3 per cent.

"Trailers for a new TV special have offered some insight into how J Crew store layouts invite the  customer to spend more money. The retailer's larger-than-life CEO, Millard 'Mickey' Drexler explains how the arrangement of products and mannequins can maximise sales, and make the most of every item's potential.In the show, which airs next Thursday, he explains to CNBC's David Faber that mannequin placement is key, as clever positioning can help guide customers in a particular direction. Visual heaven: J Crew reveals how the brand's store layouts invite the  customer to spend more money - from where the shoes are displayed to the placement of mannequins - every detail makes a difference . He reveals that nail polish and jewellery is displayed with the clothing, rather than in a separate section of the store, in a bid to highlight the range of product on offer.For the same reason, a pair of shoes or selection of belts might be placed near a contrasting dress or shirt, helping the customer imagine how they might put a look together.Arranging products in a variety of ways, with some folded, others hanging, encourages a buyer to explore the offering more, because everything is within easy reach, he continues. 'I see it and I feel it,' Mr Drexler, 67, tells , lifting one folded item. 'This is a beautiful cashmere cable sweater. 'When something is out of reach, it presents a problem.' Proving that even his team are fallible, an example presents itself when he comes across a display of brown belts in a narrow-necked jar. 'This is not an easy shopping thing,' he admits. 'I hope these belts are someplace else.' Merchandising maverick: The CNBC special focuses on CEO, Millard 'Mickey' Drexler, who has helped turn the once failing brand around to become a retail success story . Merchandise mathematics: Mickey Drexler reveals when something is out of reach, it presents a problem . Mr Drexler used the example of this season's must-have polka dot print to show how essential layout is to sales. Explaining that the print would look overwhelming of the shirt and the dress were to be displayed side-by-side, he said: 'The last thing you want is polka dots hanging together.' A sales assistant confirmed the effectiveness of the concept: 'The polka dot long-sleeve shirt, that people are loving, have been flying out the door,' she said. Mr Drexler, 67, who, in the past, has revolutionised brands including Gap and Ann Taylor, is hailed the 'king of retail' in the CNBC special. It describes how he transformed the once-failing brand into a retail success story that makes $2billion in sales each year.

"New evidence has shown ancient Egyptian embalmers did not always leave the heart in place or remove the guts using cedar oil enemas, as has been believed for thousands of years. Much of the information about Egyptian mummification comes from Herodotus, a fifth century BC Greek historian. Herodotus described first and second class levels of embalming. The elite, he said, got a slit through the belly, through which organs were removed. Ancient rites: In the fifth century, Herodotus describes first and second class levels of embalming. The elite, he said, got a slit through the belly, through which organs were removed . For the lower classes, he said mummies had organs eaten away with an enema of cedar oil, which was thought to be similar to turpentine. Herodotus also claimed that the brain was removed during embalming and other accounts suggest that that heart was always left in place. However, the ancient historical source has been dismissed by researchers. 'A lot of his accounts sound more like tourist stories, so we're reticent to take everything he said at face value,' Andrew Wade, an anthropologist at the University of Western Ontario told LiveScience. The new research findings, published in the February issue of HOMO - Journal of Comparative Human Biology, came from analysing 150 mummies from the ancient world. Embalming was a competitive business, and the tricks of the trade were closely guarded secrets, says Wade, the study co-author. Wade and his colleague Andrew Nelson looked through the literature to see how eviscerations actually took place. They discovered details on how 150 mummies were embalmed over thousands of years in ancient Egypt. They also conducted CT scans and 3D reconstructions on seven mummies. One of their key findings was that for upper class Egyptians, evisceration was sometimes performed through a slit in the rear. Facing eternity: Coffins for mummies were often form-fitting, to make sure that drying occurred more easily. Egypt is  thought to be the only country in the world where the process of preserving a body became an art . In addition, there wasn't much indication that cedar oil enemas were used, as described by Herodotus. Only 25 per cent had their hearts left in place. The removal of the heart seems to coincide with the transition period when the middle class gained access to mummification, so getting to keep the heart may have become a status symbol after that point, Wade said. Egyptian pharaohs often ordered jewels and even wives to be placed in tombs, so that they could bring them along on their spiritual journey. Embalming was the process of drying a body. Internal organs, besides the heart and kidney, were removed, and then the inside of the body was rinsed with wine to kill bacteria. Salt was added inside the body, to dry it further, and then the corpse was covered with sawdust. Bodies were often painted and massaged to make them supple, then stuffed and perfumed before being placed in a coffin. Coffins for mummies were often form-fitting, to make sure that drying occurred more easily. Egypt is thought to be the only country in the world where the process of preserving a body became an art. Huge fees were charged for making Egyptians immortal, which was of paramount importance to them. It is estimated that some 70 million mummies were created before the practice became extinct. It is often believed that mummies were ousted by the gradual rise of Christianity in the areas of South America, Egypt and Mexico. According to this religion, mummification was declared pagan.","Mummies were believed to have had their organs eaten away with an enema of cedar oil, which was thought to be similar to turpentine .

"The mother of the Muslim convert who shot dead a Canadian soldier outside Parliament on Wednesday reunited with her estranged son over lunch just days ago - the first time she'd seen him in five years. Michael Zehaf-Bibeau's mother Susan Bibeau released a statement on behalf of herself and her ex-husband saying she did not know what to say to those hurt in the attack and could offer 'no explanation' for her son's actions. 'No words can express the sadness we are feeling at this time,' she said in the release on behalf of herself and Bibeau-Zehaf's father, Bulgasem Zehaf. 'We are so sad that a man lost his life. He has lost everything and he leaves behind a family that must feel nothing but pain and sorrow. We send our deepest condolences to them although words seem pretty useless. We are both crying for them.' Susan Bibeau, whose son had his passport seized after he was designated a 'high-risk traveler', works as a federal public servant for the Immigrant & Refugee board and lives in Montreal. Scroll down for video . Shock: The mother of Michael Zehaf-Bibeau (left), Susan Bibeau (right), said she did not know what to say to the victims of her son's attack on Parliament on Wednesday morning. She is an immigration official . Questions: A police car sits outside Susan Bibeau's Montreal home early on Thursday, hours after the attack . On Wednesday, her son gunned down 24-year-old single dad Nathan Cirillo as he stood guard by the National War Memorial in Ottawa, before running inside the Parliament and opening fire. His shooting spree was stopped when sergeant-in-arms Kevin Vickers shot him dead. After the shooting, it emerged that Zehaf-Bibeau had recently converted to Islam and friends had been worried about his mental health. A criminal court database revealed there were 13 Quebec court records dating back to June 2001 involving him, including drugs charges, weapons charges, assault causing bodily harm and robbery. His full name according to court documents is - 'Michael, Joseph, Paul, Abdallah Bulgasem Zehaf Bibeau'. His close friend David Bathurst, a fellow convert, said Bibeau had told him that he wanted to travel to the Middle East, but it is not known if he made contact with any extremists.

'We have no explanation to offer. I am mad at our son, I don’t understand and part of me wants to hate him at this time. You write that our son was vulnerable, we don’t know, we (he) was lost and did not fit in. I his mother spoke with him last week over lunch, I had not seen him for over five years before that. So I have very little insight to offer. We don’t wish to be part of any media circus, we don’t think it will add anything to the conversation. Please respect our privacy although many may not feel we deserve any ... Once again we are so sorry.' He says Zehaf-Bibeau insisted that he was 'only going abroad with the intent of learning about Islam and to study Arabic.' But sources told The Globe and Mail 'he had not been able to secure a valid travel document from federal officials, who have been taking measures to prevent Canadians from joining extremists overseas.' It's understood that he traveled to the U.S on four occasions, most recently in 2013. Officials there are trying to trace whom he met while in the country. Bathurst says that after friction with the elders at the house of worship, Zehaf-Bibeau was eventually asked to stop attending prayers at the mosque. In her statement Ms Bibeau did not reference her son's mental health or religious conversion. 'We also wish to apologize for all the pain, fright and chaos he created,' she continued.

"Commuters streaming into New York City today endured lengthy waits, crowded platforms and trains crammed full with disgruntled passengers - a week after Superstorm Sandy ravaged the country. The Monday morning rush hour gave the recovering transit system its first stress test, revealing massive problems that still persist a week after public transport ground to a halt across the city. Carriages were so crowded on the Long Island Rail Road that scores of people missed their trains, while queues for the ferry in Jersey City stretched to several hundred people by daybreak. Nearly all subway lines are now running and service has been restored on key lines connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn - yet officials warned travellers they could still experience problems. Hectic: People wait at a crowded subway stop as the city tries to recover from the effects of Hurricane Sandy in Brooklyn, New York. Some of the city's transit system is still not operating . Waiting: Most of the subway lines are running, but trains are less frequent and slower . Other water-logged subway tunnels are still not ready for rush hour and . that trains will be less frequent and slower than normal, officials said. The subway system, which carries 5.5 . million riders daily, still suffers from damage to underwater tunnels, . submerged tracks near the coastline and wrecked stations and equipment, they added. 'Service will not be normal tomorrow, . and we need you to understand that before you enter the system,' Gov. Andrew Cuomo warned on Sunday. Workers called their employers . from crowded platforms to ask to work from home, while . others tried to figure out complicated routes to their offices. 'There's not much we can do,' said Louis Holmes as he waited to . board a ferry in Jersey City to his job as a security guard at . Manhattan's September 11 memorial site. 'We'll get there whatever time we can, and our jobs have to understand. It's better late than absent.' Manic: People wait in a line to enter a crowded subway stop in Brooklyn during the Monday morning commute . Desperate: A man looks at the line to enter the crowded subway stop on Monday morning . Patience: Last week, commuters had been forced to take cars or buses, sparking gridlock across Manhattan . Squeeze: Disgruntled commuters cram into subway trains as the public transit system attempts to recover . On Long Island, Janice Gholson told AP she could not get off her train from Ronkonkoma and Wyandanch because ofthe overcrowded carriage, and ended up travelling past her stop. 'I've never taken the train before,' she said. 'There were people blocking the doorway so I got stuck on the train.' Mayor Michael Bloomberg took the subway . to work on Monday and was joined by many of the students returning to . class for the first time since Sandy hit last Monday. Limited service is now available on the M line, which operates around Queens and Brooklyn, and the F line, which connects Brooklyn and lower Manhattan. Other train lines which also cross the East River - the Q, 2, 3, and D - are running. On . Saturday, trains on the 4 and 5 lines began running through pumped-out . tunnels under the East River into Brooklyn, and the 7 line was running . from Midtown into Queens. Back in action: A new subway map shows how most services are running again after Hurricane Sandy . Flooded: New York City MTA workers used a special Pump Train to pump water out of the flooded Cranberry Street tunnel which carries the A and C trains between Brooklyn and Manhattan . This picture shows just how deep the flood water inside South Ferry Station is with most of the doors here fully submerged . Ticket machines in the station can be seen partially submerged here . The 6 train, which runs from the Brooklyn Bridge up Lexington Avenue in Manhattan and into the Bronx, is also back on line. Others, including the N, R, A and E, are fully restored bar short sections at the end of each line. Yet with tunnels still flooded in . Williamsburg and Greenpoint in Brooklyn, the L and G trains are likely . to remain out of service on Monday. MTA released photos on . Saturday showing workers draining two of the seven train tunnels . beneath the East River that were flooded in the aftermath of . Hurricane Sandy. On Saturday, MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said that five off the seven flooded tunnels under the East River have been drained, but much work still remains to be done. The 14th Street tube, which carries the L train into Williamsburg, is still inundated 'from wall to wall and floor to ceiling'. Not done yet: Work continues around the South Ferry Subway as vast amounts of water is pumped out of the Station in Battery Park on Friday . Closed: South Ferry station remains closed indefinitely as workers struggle to repair the damage left from Sandy . Massive queues: Because of limited service, New Yorkers are forced to take shuttles; here, lines form outside of Grand Central on November 2 . The superstorm that has left 109 dead . and plunged 60 million people into darkness, sent torrents of water into . the New York City’s massive subway system that serves 5.5 million . riders daily, paralyzing mass transit for days. Trains stopped running at 7pm Sunday . 28 as the MTA preemptively closed down service for only the second time . in its history in an effort to secure the system, but that did little to . prevent massive damage. All . seven tunnels carrying trains between Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens . were initially submerged, marking the worst’s disaster in the subway’s . 108-year history.

This stretch looks more like a sewer system than a subway, with the track entirely submerged under floodwater . Maintenance workers can be seen making their way down the tunnel as they continue to pump floodwater from the subway . Workers eventually manage to drain this stretch . The Army’s water-removal team consisting of more than a dozen experts has been using 12 eight-inch pumps and 13 six-inch pumps shipped from New Orleans. Once bigger pumps arrive, the MTA chairman said it won’t take much time to drain the tunnels. Until then, the job is slow-going. Each subway tunnel would require four pumps that could remove 1,000-1,500 gallons per minute, a 2011 New York City report estimated. At that rate, about 7.2 million gallons per day, per tunnel could be drained, although it remains unknown exactly how long it would take to drain all of the water.","Commuters fought to squeeze on crowded trains during Monday commute .

"A daughter bravely took the stand  to face her neighbor who shot dead her mother before spending 10 hours raping her and sexually assaulting her two friends. Jamey Shields faced Duncan Willis, 27, who killed her mother Katherine Hawley, 58, after marching to her Michigan home in a fit of rage thinking she had reported him to child welfare officers. Shields faced her attacker, saying he was not worthy to be called by name and that his children do not deserve to have him as a father, reports MLive.com.

Shields (right) faced her attacker (left) saying he was not worthy to be called by name and that his children do not deserve to have him as a father . When Willis responded to her, saying: 'You know nothing about me,' he was ordered to be silent by the judge. Sarah Baker, whose seven-month-old daughter and two seven-year-old boys were in the house while she was being attacked, said: 'My whole world has been rocked.' 'He didn't ruin me because I will never let him win.' Willis was sentenced to a term of life plus 202 years on Wednesday for the murder and brutal attacks at a home in Mecosta County, Michigan in 2013. Willis shot Kathleen Hawley, 58, a mother-of-two and grandmother, in the head as soon as she arrived to help her daughter . He was found guilty earlier of first-degree murder, first-degree criminal sexual conduct, carrying a dangerous weapon with unlawful intent and felony firearm. Willis had recently gained custody of six-year-old twins and was caring for three other children. But the attack began when he decided a report to child welfare workers had come from someone in Shields' house - police said it did not. Armed with a long gun he went over to Shields' home - she was on the phone to her boyfriend at the time, but ended the call suddenly. Her concerned boyfriend, who was out of the state, then alerted her mother who rushed over to the home. But Willis shot Hawley, a mother-of-two and grandmother, in the head as soon as she arrived. Her body was on the floor throughout the ten hour ordeal which ensued and he did not attempt to hide it from the children in the home. He then raped and sexual assaulted Shields and two other women - ages 20-30 -  in the house. Police say Willis kept the women and three children hostage all night before finally surrendering after negotiations - the children were not hurt. Willis denies committing any of the crimes, an attempt to deflect responsibility that rings hollow, according to Mecosta County Prosecutor Peter Jaklevic.

'He is not that monster,' his sister Melissa Earl said at the time, reported Mlive. She admitted he struggled with anger issues and alcoholism in the past and did have a record of domestic violence. He had previous convictions for domestic violence and assault. Earl said she had spoken with Willis a day before the attack to make plans for their mother to drive from Texas to Michigan to spend Thanksgiving with Willis and his children. But she said he struggled with anger issues and stress for many years and had visited Community Mental Health weeks before the attack but claimed his appointments were cancelled. Willis had most recently worked two jobs, one as a Pizza Hut manager. Hawley's niece told FOX 17 her aunt was married to a retired police officer until he passed away from cancer. 'She took care of her husband until his last breath. 'Aunt Kat was a caretaker, always looking out for her family. 'She adored her dogs. She had many throughout her home,' she said.","Duncan Willis, 27, was sentenced to a term of life plus 202 years .

"A newborn is in critical condition after being born in a motel bathtub when his mother was on a crack cocaine binge. Chrystal A. Hassell has been arrested for child neglect after she called the police to alert them that the baby boy was turning blue on Friday night. The premature baby is in critical condition and the mother is on suicide watch at the Marion County jail in Florida. Earlier pregnancy: When Chrystal Hassell was arrested on Friday, police took custody of her 11-month-old son (she is pictured during that pregnancy above) and the newborn, both boys' father is Terry who is in jail . The Ocala Star Banner reports that the baby and his 11-month-old brother have been taken into custody by the Department of Children and Families, and the 11-month-old has been put into foster care. Hassell, 37, also has a 16-year-old daughter who was born addicted to drugs as a result of Hassell's drug use during her pregnancy. She told police that she has been using the illegal substances since she was a teenager. Once she found out that she was pregnant in March- at which point doctors told her she was six or seven months along- she vowed not to smoke crack because of the baby. That didn't last, however, and the day before the baby was born, she checked into the Vacation Host Inn and went on a binge. The baby was born in the bathtub and Hassell used her teeth to cut the umbilical cord. Arrested: Chrystal Hassell (pictured) only learned that she was pregnant in March when doctors told her she was six or seven months along, and she tried not to do drugs during the pregnancy but couldn't last . Suicide watch: Hassell has been placed in a guarded ward and was arrested for child neglect after she called the police because her newborn was turning blue . The baby's father is Hassell's boyfriend Vincent Terry who is currently in jail as well after a warrant for attempted murder and domestic violence was issued for him stemming from an unspecified incident in El Pasco County, Colorado. Terry, 43, is the father of both the newborn and the 11-month-old boy. 'I knew she had a history of doing drugs, but not that she was doing drugs. She just found out she was pregnant,' Terry said to the Ocala Star Banner on Tuesday. He and Hassell appeared together at a court hearing on Tuesday to determine what should be done about their children while they are in jail. Between her Friday arrest and the court hearing, the 11-year-old was in DCF custody and the newborn remains in critical condition at the UF Heatlh Shands Hospital in Gainesville. Behind bars: Hassell was arrested Friday (left) and her boyfriend, the newborn's father, Vincent Terry (right) was already in jail for attempted murder and domestic violence charges from when they lived in Colorado . Now the parents have given over a list of names of relatives who could watch the children but DCF will be running background checks on the individuals before handing over care. The status of Hassell's 16-year-old daughter from another relationship is unclear. 'Of course we’re going to stay together. My kids are here. She’s not a bad person. She just got a problem and, together, we’ll fight it,' Terry told the Ocala Star Banner. Terry told the paper that they have picked out a name for the boy- that they would not publicly disclose- and are trying to get in touch with the hospital so that the name could be added to the boy's birth certificate. Longstanding issues: Hassell has a daughter who is now 16-years-old (pictured together in 2009) who was born addicted to drugs because Hassell smoked crack during the pregnancy . Child neglect charges have been filed against Hassell though it is unclear what, if anything, she will face regarding the possible drug possession and use. Terry said that he thought that probation for his earlier drug possession charge had expired and did not realize that he was breaking the law by leaving Colorado. He claims that he did not know about the attempted murder and domestic violence charges and has already signed extradition papers so that he will face the charges in Colorado.","Chrystal Hassell, 37, didn't know she was pregnant until March and smoked crack the night before she gave birth on Friday .

"New figures from the NHS show there were 833 hospital admissions for children suffering from rickets . The number of children suffering from rickets – once associated with Victorian poverty – is on the rise, with a fourfold increase in sufferers in the last ten years. New figures from the NHS show there were 833 hospital admissions for children suffering from the condition which is caused by a lack of Vitamin D in the financial year 2012-13. Ten years earlier the figure was just 190. Some experts fear that parents obsessing about protecting their children from sunlight, which boosts the body’s level of the key vitamin, has led to the rise. It is also thought that children spending more time indoors on computer games, more parents driving their kids to school and fewer children taking cod liver oil capsules have all contributed to the rise. The disease, which causes brittle bones and deformities, was common in 19th century Britain but was all but wiped out by improvements in nutrition. Now it is thought that a fear of contracting skin cancer could be making parents too cautious and be partly responsible for the upsurge in Rickets. The body produces vitamin D when it is exposed to the sun and it can also be obtained by eating foods such as oily fish, eggs and liver. Gillian Killiner, director of 121 Dietitian, and a spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association, said: ‘There are several factors involved in the rise in rickets. ‘It was a problem disease in the 19th century but a number of things including diet with more dairy and protein, better health and the introduction of cod liver oil by the government in WWII, helped reduce it to very small numbers. ‘Now it is on the rise again partly because of a change in the quality of our diet and partly because of our aversion to sunlight, which has been caused by our justifiable concerns about skin cancer. The body produces vitamin D when it is exposed to the sun and it can also be obtained by eating foods such as oily fish, eggs and liver . ‘People now are eating much less oily fish, fewer dairy products and not supplementing. Kids are also eating more processed and junk food, while people whose bodies are obese find it much more difficult to access their vitamin D. ‘In addition the skin cancer message . has got home and people are aware of the dangers of burning. But perhaps . things have gone too far as exposure to sunlight is the best way to . absorb vitamin D and as little as 20 minutes per day of sun on your face . and arms can be more than enough.’ She . added that the babies of mothers already low in vitamin D were the . children most as risk as they would have no way of boosting their . levels. ‘There are now . campaigns to get mothers to boost their vitamin D levels so that they . can pass it on to their babies in their breast milk,’ she said. People . with darker skin have more difficulty getting vitamin D from sunlight . and so it is these people, often ethnic minorities, and their children . who are more at risk of rickets. Professor . Nicholas Clarke, said: ‘The data confirms our suspicions in relation to . the epidemiology of vitamin D deficiency, particularly in our own . paediatric orthopaedic clinic. ‘There is no doubt that it is multifactorial both in terms of reduced exposure to sunshine, but also the tension between the dermatological advice in respect of sun screen and adequate sun exposure. ‘However, it should be remembered that vitamin D deficiency is utterly preventable and easily treated by minor supplements. ‘It is also important to note that the Chief Medical Officer has now advised that all children from the age of 6 months to 5 years should take vitamin D supplements in order to prevent deficiency and its effect on later health issues.’","New figures from the NHS show there were 833 hospital admissions .

"The family of the eight-year-old boy killed in the Boston marathon bombings has revealed the heartbreaking moment their daughter awoke two weeks after the attack and learned her brother had died. Seven-year-old Jane Richard lost her leg in the April 15 blast, while her mother Denise, 42, suffered head injuries, her father Bill, 42, was hit by shrapnel and her brother Martin lost his life. Only her oldest brother, 12-year-old Henry, escaped without injury. In a statement released on Thursday, the family revealed Jane awoke two weeks after the attack 'with difficult questions that . needed to be answered'. 'There are not words to describe how hard . sharing this heartbreaking news was on all of us,' it read. Torn apart: The Richard family has revealed that Jane, 7, (pictured front) has awoken from surgery and was told that her brother Martin (right) was killed in the Boston bombings on April 15 . Amid the tragedy, the family is celebrating the progress of little Jane, who has now undergone her eleventh surgery to close the wound on her left leg and to eventually prepare it for a prosthesis. She has battled infections in hospital and faces more surgeries after losing her leg below the knee. 'While she has more trips to the O.R. ahead of her, last night's operation marked an important milestone,' the statement read. 'If things go well, Jane could be ready to transition to the rehabilitation stage of her recovery in the next few weeks.' Bill is recovering from his shrapnel wound and is hopeful that he will regain hearing he lost from the blast, while Denise is recovering from her surgeries, but is still missing sight in one eye. Victim: Martin was one of three spectators killed when two bombs detonated at the marathon . Victims: Jane, left, is recovering from the blast that claimed her leg and killed her big brother Martin, right . Henry has returned to school, 'which gives him a needed sense of routine and normalcy', the statement, which was uploaded to the family's website, said. The Richards also took the time to thank members of the public and authorities for their help throughout 'our very darkest hour'. 'We want to thank the people who quickly got to Jane and addressed her injury in the street because they saved her life,' it read. 'We also salute those who stood guard over Martin’s body so he was not alone. Those officers will never know how comforting that was in our very darkest hour.' Jane Richard is believed to have been standing on the marathon fence next to the big brother she idolized when the first of two bombs detonated near to the finish line. Moments before: Martin (circled blue), his sister and father can be seen watching the marathon while one of the alleged bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, and his bomb are circled with red . Images from before the blast appear to show . Bill, 42, a community organizer, holding his youngest children up on the . railings as Dzhokhar Tsarnaev plants his backpack bomb just behind . them. Bill and Jane's eldest brother Henry, 12, managed to escape from the bomb attack uninjured. It isn't clear whether any of the women . in the photograph is the children's mother, school librarian Denise, 43, . who sustained head injuries and had to undergo brain surgery following . the attack. Jane is an enthusiastic Irish dancer having attended classes at the Clifden Academy of Irish Dance in Milton since the age of three, local reports noted. Neighbors said Jane looked up to her older brother and they both attended the Neighborhood House Charter School in Dorchester, where their mother served as the school librarian. Tracey Monroe, a bystander who came to Jane's aid in the moments after the blast, told WCVB.com: 'I saw her laying in the street. I held her head in my hands and I tried to rub her and comfort her. I asked what her name was and she said Jane. Blast: A photo shows the first bomb explode near the finish line of the Boston marathon on April 15 . Boston firefighter James Plourde carried one of the more than 180 injured away from the scene . 'Killers': Tamerlan Tsarnaev, left, and his younger brother Dzhokhar, right, allegedly planted the devices . 'She was just a baby and so badly injured and scared. But she was so incredibly brave. I saw him [Martin] and at that point I knew he was gone. I'll never forget them - that little girl, she was so brave.' The bombs, described by experts as makeshift anti-personnel devices, were made from pressure cookers packed with shrapnel and ball bearings to cause the maximum injuries to bystanders. Police believe they were planted by brothers Dzhokhar, 19, and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26. After their images were released by the FBI, Tamerlan was killed in an ensuing gunfight with police. His younger brother was found hiding in a boat outside a home hours later and was treated in hospital for an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound to the neck. He remains in federal prison in Massachusetts and is charged with using a weapon of mass destruction.

"An astronomical artist has created eye-opening illustrations imagining what the night sky would look like if the moon was replaced by the other planets in the solar system. Ron Miller, a former art director for NASA, used digital trickery to superimpose . scale drawings of Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and . Neptune over the same landscape, highlighting the sheer size of the planets. The incredible drawings imagine each planet to be 233,812 miles from Earth - the same distance at which the moon orbits. Enormous planet Jupiter, around 11 times the size of Earth, would dominate the skies while Mars would appear to be around twice the size of the moon. Artist: Ron Miller used this view of the moon over Death Valley, California, as the basis for his images . Perspective: The former NASA art director imagined how Neptune would look from earth if it was the same distance away as the moon . Huge: The diameter of Jupiter is 40 times that of the moon and it would dominate the night sky if it were in the same position . Red planet: Mars would appear around twice the size of the moon from 233,812 miles away . Mr Miller, from West Virginia, USA, said: 'We are all familiar with the moon in our skies but many people struggle to appreciate the sheer size of the planets we share our solar system with. 'The planets are just a vague concept to a lot of people and even the moon is just a fuzzy ball in the sky. 'I had a bright idea one morning to create a series of illustrations in which the moon is replaced with other planets, something I don't think has been done before. I wanted the illustrations to be thought-provoking and catch people's imaginations. 'I wanted to show people the effects these planets would have on landscapes, and show them what amazing places the planets are.' He explained that Jupiter is so large that from Earth we would not be able to see the north and south poles of the planet, as it would fill the sky as far as we can see. While Saturn's rings would stretch nearly from horizon to horizon. 'We would all feel a lot more humble with Jupiter's presence constantly looking over us,' he added. 'The reaction to the illustrations has been fantastic. I'm very pleased because they were created to inspire people. Plus, the only way I get to visit these planets is through my illustrations.' Orb: Uranus would look a similar size to Neptune, according to Mr Miller, who has created the images to highlight the size of the planets . Night sky: Smallest planet Mercury would look just slightly larger than the moon from the same distance .

"The 17-year-old father of a baby boy who died just weeks after his birth mother took him back from his lesbian adoptive parents has been charged with first-degree murder. Four-month-old Gabriel King McFarland was found unresponsive on April 22 by his mother after she left the baby in the care of his father, Drew James Weehler-Smith, at their Des Moines, Iowa home. The boy later passed away and an autopsy revealed that Gabriel died of an abusive head trauma, which authorities say he suffered at the hands of his teen dad. The . tragedy came just a month after the teen mother, Markeya Atkins, changed . her mind about giving him up for adoption and took him back from the . women who had brought him up as their own. Loss: Four-month-old Gabriel McFarland died on . April 22 after he suffered an abusive head trauma while in the care of . his teenage father. Gabriel's mother had just taken him back from an . adoption . Investigators have not yet determined how the baby suffered the deadly injuries but his teen dad was the only one at home with the boy, police told the Des Moines register. Gabriel's mother, Markeya Atkins, . had left him in the care of his father so she could run errands around 7.25pm on April 22, police said. About 25 . minutes later, a friend dropped into the apartment to collect a phone . charger and saw the father holding the child. She left and called the . mother asking whether she trusted Weehler-Smith. Atkins asked her friend to return to the . apartment but when she did, she saw the father driving away without . the baby. Teen mom: Markeya Atkins, 16, took the boy back on March 13, three months after the youngster was born . Loss: Atkins said she could never have imagined that her son would have died after being returned to her . She . notified the mother, who rushed home and found Gabriel limp and not . breathing in a glider chair. 'Someone left my . friend's baby that they were baby-sitting by themselves, and the baby's . blue,' the friend can be heard saying on the 911 calls, with Atkins crying in the background: 'He just left him here.' Atkins' friend performed CPR before emergency medical personel took over. But the boy was pronounced dead at hospital. Weehler-Smith, a junior at Des Moines Roosevelt High . School, was initially charged with neglect of a dependent person but now the murder charge has now been added. He is being charges as an adult and faces life in prison if found guilty of the murder charge and 50 years behind bars if convicted of endangerment. Tragic: Rachel and Heidi McFarland, pictured, cared for Gabriel from birth until the middle of March . Loving moms: The McFarlands said they only heard about Gabriel's death on Tuesday on the news . 'I never thought in my wildest dreams this would happen,' Atkins told WHO-TV on Thursday as she spoke out about her son's death for the first time. She explained that she had initially wanted to give up her son for adoption because she did not think she would be able to care for him. Rachel and Heidi McFarland adopted the boy and cared for him from birth until he was a few months old - when Atkins changed her mind, as is allowed under Iowa law. 'When you . have a baby it's like this instinct comes on where a part of you just . feels like you have something left in this world,' Atkins said. The . couple said they were devastated when they learned that the infant they . had considered their own had died - while watching the news. Adorable: Police have charged Drew James Weehler-Smith of Des Moines with neglect of a dependent person after he left his son, pictured, alone in an apartment on Tuesday . Scene: According to police, the young mom left the baby with Weehler-Smith in an apartment, pictured, in the 6500 block of Chaffee Road at about 7:25p.m. while she went to the library and to run errands . 'It's like he's been taken away from you again,' Rachel McFarland told the Des Moines Register. 'We brought him home from the hospital. I cut his umbilical cord.' In Iowa, the birth mother has three months and then one additional . 31-day probationary period to change her mind about giving up her baby. While devastated, the McFarlands are determined not to let the failed adoption and Gabriel's death ruin their lives. 'We're just left to put the pieces back together,' Rachel said.

"Hairdryers will be the next household gadget to be given the silent treatment by Sir James Dyson as he puts in a patent for a soundless model. The inventor of the bagless vacuum cleaner has registered plans for the gadget which shows diagrams of the 'hand-held blower with an insulating chamber'. Sir James is widely known for his vacuum cleaners but he has more recently branched out into bladeless fans and the 'airblade' fast-drying hand dryer, The Guardian has reported. Design: The 'hairblade' hairdryer . Ballbarrow A wheelbarrow with a ball replacing the wheel . Trolleyball A trolley that launched boats . Bagless vacuum cleaner The Dyson cleaner was the first bagless vacuum . Dyson Ball Vacuum cleaner using the ball from the Ballbarrow . Dyson Airblade Fast-working hand dryer . Air Multiplier Bladeless fan . The blueprint for the new hairdryer goes into detail about how it will work. The patent application shows air will flow through two chambers and out the front of the handheld device. The bladeless fan was another 'noiseless' device and hairdressers will surely be first in line as standard hairdryers can be as loud as 75 decibels. Sir James usually keeps his new designs under wraps and his patents closely guarded. He recently begun a legal battle with Samsung, claiming that the electronics giant ‘ripped off’ one of its inventions. Inventor: Sir James Dyson closely guards his patents and his company now holds 3,000 for 500 inventions . The 66-year-old engineer said the South Korean company’s new MotionSync range ‘directly copied’ the steering mechanics of Dyson’s DC37 and DC39 models. Dyson said it patented the central . ball system – which allows a vacuum to move more easily around corners, . table legs and over carpets – in 2009, and spent three years developing . the design. In 2009 a . British judge ordered Samsung to pay Dyson about £600,000 after it tried . to patent the UK firm’s ‘triple-cyclone’ suction technology.

"Aspiring police officers have hit out at force chiefs for insisting they study for and pass a new £1,300 certificate before they can start the job. Police hopefuls - who would previously have been trained on the job - now say they have been put off by new rules which mean they need to spend 300 hours studying before they can even start their official training. The Certificate in Knowledge of Policing is already a requirement to join six police forces, including the Met, and other forces are considering introducing the new standard. Barriers: Young people hoping to join the Metropolitan Police, like these new officers pictured at a 'passing out' parade, will need a £1,300 qualification . The College of Policing, which has developed the course, has said it will help make the police 'a true professional service' like medicine or the law. Under the new system applicants will be sent out to study with external providers who charge between £600 and £1,300 for the course. One 25-year-old prospective officer, who declined to be named, said there is 'no way' he could afford to splash out on a course which provides only 'basic training'. The history graduate, who holds a Master's degree from Queen's University Belfast, has already racked up £20,000 of student debt and is not prepared to risk money training for a job he may never get. He told careers site GraduateFog.co.uk: 'I couldn’t believe it when I saw I’d need a specific qualification – costing up to £1,300. Diversity? Met Police commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe, pictured at a ceremony marking the recruitment of new officers, has said he wants to recruit a wider range of people into the force . 'The course content seems to be little more than legal theory that I assumed would be considered part of basic training for successful candidates. 'Having had only temporary employment since graduating, I decided not to apply, for the simple reason that if I was rejected, it would be wasted money. 'I graduated with £20,000 of student loans and there is no way I can afford to gamble more money on a job I could be rejected for at any stage. 'I don’t feel it’s fair for the Met to ask for applicants to pay for their own training... they will certainly miss out on other young candidates like me who are worried about money. 'To lots of young people, the £1,300 price tag for the CKP is certainly enough to put us off from applying.' The course - which will only enable applicants to apply for policing jobs - includes basic policing duties such as how not to misuse their powers, how to search buildings and people and how to conduct interviews. Labour MP for Mitcham and Morden Siobhain McDonagh is campaigning against the fee. She said: 'Why should our best, most talented youngsters have to fork out £1,000 for the privilege of joining the police? And she has set up an e-petition against it. She added: I'm asking you to sign a petition. Let's get the message through to David Cameron.' The new requirement comes despite the insistence of Met Police commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe that the force should try to attract as wide a range of people as possible. Last week he said he would support a new system in which the organisation would have to take on a new ethnic minority officer for every white officer they take on. He hopes the change will leave the force 'looking and feeling' more like London - though the force has admitted that the new qualification has the 'potential for adverse impact on individuals from BME (black and minority ethnic) backgrounds.' The Met Police has said it will . introduce loans to cover course fees from May, but applicants will have to pass a means test and will only be available for those who already live . in London. Tanya de Grunwald, founder of GraduateFog.co.uk said: 'The Government and the Met should admit they have got this policy wrong - it is not fair or right to demand that young applicants stump up such a large amount of money on the off-chance they may be offered a job later. 'Even providing loans won't fix the problem - unsuccessful applicants would still be left out-of-pocket.' A College of Policing spokesman said: 'The certificate is an excellent grounding in policing and the skills are transferable to other areas of the criminal justice system. 'There are a lot of changes happening in policing at the moment and as part of that, the job of the College of Policing is to professionalise the service. The police are moving in a direction of being a true professional service, similar to other professions such as medicine and law. 'There was nothing in place before the certificate, so now candidates have the chance to educate themselves on policing and take responsibility for their learning.’ A Met Police spokesman said: 'We support any initiative that's about raising standards and competence in policing, and the CKP has a role to play in that. 'Policing is no different from many other professions, in requiring those interested in a career to achieve a specific qualification before joining.'","Police require Certificate in Knowledge of Policing, costing up to £1,300 .

"With its giant spires and magnificent dome to rival that of St Peter's Basillica, Mejorada del Campo's impressive cathedral looks like it has been skilfully crafted by a team of architectural experts. It's impossible to believe that it has been single-handedly built by a former trappist monk who had never laid a brick in his life. The as yet unfinished building, a little over 12 miles outside of Madrid, has been painstakingly built piece by piece over 50 years by 86-year-old farmer Justo Gallego Martinez. Scroll down for video . 'Act of faith': Justo Gallego Martinez, known as Don Justo, has spent 50 years building a 131ft cathedral from junk in Mejorada del Campo, Spain . Work in progress: Despite five decades of painstaking toil, the cathedral is far from finished . Stunning: A huge dome made from plastic food tubs is the centre-piece of the incredible structure . Beautiful: With its large dome and huge spires, the building is based on St Peter's basilica in Rome and a variety of European churches and castles . Holy: Parts of the building's interior and exterior are painted to depict scenes from the Bible . Novice: Don Justo, pictured working on the building (left), had no architectural training or construction experience before starting to build the cathedral (right) He had no prior knowledge of architecture and no experience in the construction industry, but instead has spent five decades collecting junk and discarded building material in order to build the 131ft tall structure. After working as a farmer and bullfighter, deeply religious Mr Martinez - or Don Justo as he is known - spent eight years at a Trappist monastery. But he was forced to leave when he was struck down with tuburculosis in 1961. During his illness, he vowed that if he survived it he would build a chapel and name it after the Virgin Mary to whom he prayed while he was sick. True to his vow, Don Justo began building what he describes as his act of faith in 1963 and despite his lack of skills or building materials, is still working on the project today. Vow: The former Trappist monk began building the giant church after surviving tuberculosis in the early 1960s . Visitors welcome: The cathedral has never had planning permission but it is believed it is tolerated because it has become a tourist attraction over the years . Makeshift: The cathedral's pillars are made from oil drums with Don Justo scouring the local area and other construction sites every day for waste materials . Dividing opinion: The cathedral's giant towers dwarf surrounding apartments, with some locals said to consider the building to be an eyesore . Construction site: Don Justo estimated six years ago that it might take him another two decades to finish the work he has started . Despite the scepticism of many friends and locals, Don Justo has remarkably managed to build the place of worship without using so much as a crane. The vast columns of the structure are made from empty oil drums, while the covering on one of the domes is made from discarded food tubes. But, with Don Justo working on his own aside from occasional help from his six nephews, the cathedral is far from finished with windows left unpainted, one of the domes to be covered and the floor to be completed. The inspiration of St Peter's Basillica with its huge central dome is plain to see, but Don Justo's ideas were also taken from the White House, and a variety of European castles and churches. No regrets: The former monk has said that if he had his life again he would start the cathedral over, but this time would build it twice as big . Unfinished: Many of the staircases in the cathedral are left unfinished and the monk says that he might not live to see the cathedral completed . Room with a view: The grounds of the giant building are seen from one of the church's spires - the tallest of which is around 131ft tall . Still going: Don Justo's cathedral is seen back in 1993 after 30 years of building work - it still remains unfinished 20 years on . Don Justo told the BBC: 'When I look at what I've created, it overwhelmes me and I give thanks to the lord. 'If I lived my life again, I'd build this cathedral again only bigger. 'Twice the size, because for me, this is an act of faith.' The church has never received planning permission, but it is believed that it is allowed to stay by local authorities because it has become something of a tourist attraction. Homage: The monk has named the cathedral after the virgin Mary whom Don Justo prayed to when he was ill with tuberculosis . Picturesque: The cathedral is pictured surrounded by trees that have grown around the impressive structure . Construction site: The cathedral looks a lot closer to being finished now than it did in pictures taken back in 1993 .","Justo Gallego Martinez has worked on the building at Mejorada del Campo near Madrid since the early 1960s .

"Scientists at Oxford University say they have pinpointed deadly 'mother cells' which produce tumours and keep them alive (library image) Scientists have got to the root of cancer. They’ve pinpointed the deadly ‘mother cells’ that give birth to tumours and keep them alive. A drug that kills these menacing cells could wipe out the disease – and cure patients. Despite advances in medicine, cancer claims more than 150,000 lives a year, making it one of Britain’s biggest killers. The ‘mother cells’, or cancer stem cells, are blamed for the disease’s spread throughout the body – the most common cause of death in cancer patients. They are also believed to be resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy and so explain why cancers come back after treatment. Long thought to exist, they have for the first time been identified and tracked in cancer patients. The breakthrough was made by Oxford University researchers who studied men and women with a form of leukaemia. They showed that a small proportion of the cancerous cells were extra-dangerous. The disease started in these stem cells.  The stem cells also made all the cells that made up the cancer – and were vital if it was to stay alive. This is important because it means that a drug that kills the ‘mother cells’ could eliminate the disease. The concept has been likened to getting rid of dandelions by pulling them out by the roots, rather than merely removing their heads. Researcher Dr Petter Woll said: ‘We have identified a subset of cancer cells, shown that these cells are invariably the cells in which the cancer originates and are also the only cancer-propagating cells in the patients. ‘It is a vitally important step because it suggests that if you want to cure patients, you would need to target and remove these cells at the root of the cancer. ‘But that would be sufficient, that would do it.’ Dr Woll cautioned that new drugs take time to develop but added:  ‘Now we know that identity of these cells in this particular group of patients, the next thing is to try to understand the biology that makes them different. Scientists say a drug that kills the mother cells could wipe out the disease, one cancerous cell pictured, and cure patients . ‘Is there anything in that biology we can take advantage of to design a therapy that would allow their elimination?’ The researchers studied one particular form of the blood cancer leukaemia.  However, they think the same principle likely applies to other types of the disease. Professor Kamil Kranc, a Cancer Research UK stem cell expert based at the University of Edinburgh, said:  ‘This finding of rare human cancer stem cells in patients with a blood disorder that often develops into acute leukaemia is a huge leap towards understanding the roots of blood cancers. ‘Cancer stem cells have long been thought to be at the heart of many types of cancers but identifying these rogue cells has been a major challenge. ‘The next step will be to find specific drugs that eliminate these unique cells, which could be key to helping more people survive cancer.’","Scientists claim they have pinpointed 'mother cells' which produce tumours .

"Five boys, some as young as 11, are suspected of starting a fire that wrecked their school on the eve of the new term. Pupils were yesterday faced with the prospect of coursework having been destroyed in the blaze at Leyland St Mary’s Catholic Technology College in Lancashire. Plans were being drawn up to provide alternative classrooms for 730 children, with parents warned to keep them at home for at least the rest of the week. Scroll down for video . Wreckage: Leyland St Mary's Catholic Technology College in Leyland, Lancashire, was devastated by the blaze at 4pm on Sunday, which saw 100ft flames - and was tackled by 125 firefighters and 20 engines . Flames: The building - which was built in 1957 - had no sprinklers. The cause of the fire is being investigated and is thought to be suspicious, Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service said . Devastation: Several parts of the school had been wrecked, with damage apparently most severe in the science block. Among the contents believed to have been destroyed in the fire was GCSE coursework . Response: About 10 engines from Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service remained at the scene early yesterday to extinguish the last pockets of flames and ensure the scene was safe . Destruction: The aftermath of the fire at St Mary's Catholic Technology College in Leyland, Lancashire . What remains: The fire engulfed most of the college in Lancashire, but left most nearby homes untouched . The 1950s science block was reduced to . rubble in Sunday’s blaze, which created clouds of smoke visible for . miles. Sources said the library and sports hall were also wrecked beyond . repair. Strong winds and a shortage of water hampered 125 firemen trying to bring it under control. They . said the fire tore rapidly through the science block’s 1957 sandwich . foam board construction before  flames spread to the nearby sports hall. Police . said yesterday that five boys – one aged 11, two 12-year-olds, one aged . 13 and one 15 – arrested on suspicion of starting the fire had been . released on bail until later this month. Parents said the suspects all attended St Mary’s. Two men aged 18 and 35 thought to have been . builders working on the school roof were treated by paramedics for . smoke inhalation. Meanwhile . it was revealed that the Leyland building had no . sprinklers. The cause of the fire is being probed and is thought . to be suspicious, Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service said. About . 10 fire engines remained at the scene early yesterday to extinguish the . last pockets of flames and ensure the scene was safe. Firefighters . were expected to remain at the scene until late this afternoon.

It's heart-breaking. It's very distressing for the staff and for the children. Everyone had been looking forward to coming back for the new school year. ‘Finding somewhere for around 730 children won't be easy. A few of the staff have turned up to see if there is anything they can do and they have all been shocked and saddened by what has happened. 'This is a very big fire and not an easy one to tackle' Chris Kenny, Lancashire's chief fire officer . ‘It's tragic because we have only just had a lot of refurbishment work done to the school during the summer break. It was a big investment. The community around here very much looks after its school.’ Lancashire's chief fire officer Chris Kenny said: ‘This is a very big fire and not an easy one to tackle. We don't know at this stage how it started. ‘We are investigating the cause, but there may be some grounds to think it may be suspicious. A full investigation with the police is underway.

"Culinary cure? It appears asparagus could have a vital role to play in combating Britain's looming diabetes crisis . Asparagus could be a powerful new culinary weapon in the fight against diabetes. Scientists have found regular intake of the increasingly popular vegetable keeps blood sugar levels under control and boosts the body’s production of insulin, the hormone that helps it to absorb glucose. UK consumption of asparagus has soared in recent years to record levels of around 8,000 tonnes a year. As well as its delicate flavour, it now appears it could have a vital role to play in combating Britain’s looming diabetes crisis. Type two diabetes, which accounts for 90 per cent of all diabetes cases, is emerging as a major health burden. According to the charity Diabetes UK, at the current rate of increase, the numbers affected will rise from around 2.5 million to four million by 2025 and five million by 2030. More than a million people are already affected by the condition but do not realise they have it, perhaps because they do not recognise symptoms, such as fatigue, thirst, frequent urination, recurrent thrush and wounds that are slow to heal. Left untreated, type two diabetes can raise the risk of heart attacks, blindness and amputation. But if doctors catch it early, it can be well controlled with diet and medication. Once known as ‘late onset’ diabetes, since it only tended to strike from middle-age onwards, doctors are now beginning to see patients in their teens and twenties with the condition. Fatty foods and unhealthy lifestyles have long been thought raise the risks. High doses of the asparagus extract had a significant effect on insulin production by the pancreas, the organ which releases the hormone into the bloodstream . To see if asparagus could help, scientists at the University of Karachi in Pakistan injected rats with chemicals to induce a diabetic state, with low levels of insulin and high blood sugar content. They then treated half with an extract from the asparagus plant and the other half with an established anti-diabetic drug, called glibenclamide. The rats were fed the asparagus extract in small or large doses every day for 28 days. Blood tests were then carried out to measure changes in their diabetes. The results, published in the British Journal of Nutrition, showed low levels of the asparagus suppressed blood sugar levels but did not improve insulin output. Only high doses of the extract had a significant effect on insulin production by the pancreas, the organ which releases the hormone into the bloodstream. The findings support earlier studies highlighting the benefits of asparagus. One published in the British Medical Journal in 2006 showed asparagus triggered an 81 per cent increase in glucose uptake by the body’s muscles and tissues. In a report on their findings the University of Karachi researchers said: ‘This study suggests asparagus extract exerts anti-diabetic effects.’","High doses of asparagus extract had a significant effect on insulin production in tests .

"These astonishing pictures provide an incredible glimpse at the lives of majestic elephant seals in the Antarctic Peninsula. Wildlife photographer Justin Hofman captured the astonishing images at Gold Harbour on South Georgia, braving the powerful and ferocious creatures' wrath to get the close-up shots. One of the photographs captures a massive elephant seal seemingly laughing at his fortune in the surf after managing to get a harem of 30 females - all to himself. You're looking pleased with yourself: A male southern elephant seal appears to laugh after defending his harem of 30 females from other males looking for a mate . A southern elephant seal appears to have smug look on its face as it protects one of the females in its harem on Gold Harbour, South Georgia in the Antarctic Peninsula . Smug: A male southern elephant seal plays in the surf, content in the knowledge he has 30 females waiting once he hits dry land . The battle-scarred giant even seems to smirk as he cosies up to one of his mates while still in sight of his now love-lorn rivals. Mr Hofman said: 'They're always making some funny noise. So to have a laughing elephant seal makes sense - they really do make ridiculous noises.' Justin, from California, spent hours photographing the large male guarding his 30-strong harem of females from rivals - including two smaller males working as a team to take him on. He said one would distract the bull in a vicious fight while the other would sneak in and mate with a female on the periphery of the harem, which can be 100-strong. However, with some elephant seals reaching 15ft in length and weighing 10,000lb, fights are no laughing matter and 'always end in bloodshed'. Community: Amazingly, these giant elephant seals and penguins live side by side in South Georgia . Hugs: As penguins mill around in the background, a southern elephant seal wraps a protective arm around a female at Gold Harbour, South Georgia, in the Antarctic Peninsula . Mr Hofman, from California, said: 'When they rear up to bash each other, they lift about two-thirds of their body straight up making them stand almost 3m high. 'They slam down onto each other with massive force and their weight, combined with very sturdy teeth, imparts damage nearly every time. 'It's not uncommon to walk around a beach and see scores of males with blood running down their face and chest.' The wildlife photographer was able to capture these close-ups because many of the males were too tired from fighting to charge him. Oy! Elephant seal engage in a roaring match after one is bitten during a battle for females . Mirror image: Two male southern elephant seals look like each other's reflection as they square up to each other . Roar: The males' clashes often end in serious injury. The photographer says  blood-spattered seals are a common sight . 'They slam down onto each other with massive force and their weight, combined with very sturdy teeth, imparts damage nearly every time', said Mr Hofman, who observed numerous vicious duels . 'When they're not fighting, you can pretty much stand within arm's length of them, just sitting there watching them breathe, looking at their scars and being awed by their size,' he said. 'But when they get up and start to bellow, you know it's time to step back.' There are two types of elephant seal, southern elephant seals and the smaller northern version. It is named after the males' snout which resembles the trunk of an elephant. The big beasts can grow to be 16ft . long and weigh over 6,000lbs, the smaller females are normally about . 10ft long and weigh in at around 2,000lbs. They . can hold their breath longer than any other cetacean animal, staying . under water without air for up to two hours.

Boy wonder: Shouryya Ray has been hailed a genius after working out the problems set by Sir Isaac Newton . Brainy: Shouryya Ray cracked puzzles set by Sir Isaac Newton which have baffled mathematicians for more than 350 years . His solutions mean that scientists can now calculate the flight path of a thrown ball and then predict how it will hit and bounce off a wall. Shouryya only came across the problems during a school trip to Dresden University where professors claimed they were uncrackable. 'I just asked myself, 'Why not?',' explained Shouryya. 'I think it was just schoolboy naivety. I didn't believe there couldn't be a solution,' he added. Modest Shouryya began solving complicated equations as a six year old but says he's no genius. 'There are other things at school I wish I was better at - football for one,' he said. For years Shouryya has enjoyed what he calls 'intrinsic beauty' of maths. When he was young, his father, an engineer, began testing his brain by setting him arithmetic problems. After arriving from Calcutta four years ago without knowing any German, Shouryya is now fluent in the language. His intelligence was quickly noted in class and he was pushed up two years in school - he is currently sitting his exams early. Modestly Shouryya has pointed out he has weak points as a mathematician, and says he is not as competent in sport.

"This is the moment an attorney stopped police from arresting a disabled black man on suspicion of burgling a house almost a mile away. Jody Westby came out of her house in Foxhall Crescent, Washington to see an officer preparing to search 64-year-old Dennis Stucky, a local handy man who told officers he was disabled. Demanding to know why he was being detained, Mrs Westby was told police received reports of a burlgary and stopped him as a possible suspect. Anger: Jody Westby (right) accosted a police officer when she saw Dennis Stucky (center) being detained . Support: Mrs Westby rushed to help Mr Stuckey as her housekeeper in Washington filmed the ordeal . 'We have a burglar alarm,' one of the officers said. 'He's coming with bags.' But after intense questioning, captured on video by her housekeeper, Mrs Wetsby discovered the burglary was in another neighborhood three-quarters of a mile away and there were no grounds for suspicion. 'I'm an attorney and this is wrong!' she said. 'Now please leave our neighborhood.' The female officer attempting to arrest Mr Stucky insisted he was 'loud and boisterous' when she stopped him. Fighter: Westby blasted the officers' conduct as they detained the man without a description . 'That's because you're accusing him,' Mrs Westby retorted. Finally, after complaining to a passing officer about the incident, she secured his release. 'Come on Dennis, they said you can go,' she said as she helped him up. She then turned to the police officer to say: 'I'm reporting this. 'Just because he's black doesn't mean he's here to rob a house. 'He works for us, he's been in this neighborhood for 30 years.' It has since emerged that the owner of the 'burgled' house had accidentally keyed in the wrong number to his garage, setting off the alert. The two officers, who were both black, did not have a description of a potential suspect when they went on patrol at 1pm on October 1. Mrs Westby told the paper: 'It was very interesting, in the sense of getting a picture of how black cops treat black people, and how humiliating it was for him. 'They were treating him just like a dog.' Washington Police told the Washington Post they believed there to be 'no misconduct' and accused Mrs Westby of making 'assumptions of her own' by accusing the officers of racism. Questions: She discovered he was being arrested on suspicion of robbing a house almost a mile away . Warning: She said she plans to report the case, accusing the cops of being racist for picking on Stuckey . No suspect: It emerged the officers did not have a description for a suspect of the alleged burglary . The incident will now be addressed at a committee on stop-searches in the city next week. Some reports have noted that, while the attorney's bold actions should be lauded, the officers' reactions are revealing about class. The Washington Post Blog by columnist Clinton Yates notes that Mrs Westby, a white, educated woman, receives 'an incredible amount of leeway and deference' from the officers. 'She’s pointing her fingers and gesturing toward the car window,' he noted. 'That's the type of behavior that coming from many other people would be considered dangerous, threatening or violent in some way.'","Jody Westby stopped Washington Police detaining disabled black man .

"The city that once covered half of its $1million budget with speeding ticket fines and other 'police revenue' is disbanding its department. The Waldo City Council voted 4-1 on Tuesday to dissolve the police force after both the police chief and his replacement were suspended over allegations that included ticket quotas. The decision to disband Waldo's police is partly due to the estimated costs of modernizing the department's facilities and computer systems, which investigations triggered by corruption allegations showed were outdated. Scandal: Former police chief Mike Szabo resigned following a scandal over a speeding ticket quota and an investigation into police misconduct . Waldo had been one of two towns designated by the American Automobile Association as a 'traffic trap,' meaning that it considered law enforcement practices to be more focused on generating revenue than enforcing safe driving behavior. Investigated: Police Chief Mike Szabo sent emails telling officers to follow an illegal quota for speeding tickets . The Gainesville Sun reports in August, five officers came forward with allegations that Police Chief Mike Szabo enforced a quota of 12 tickets for every 12-hour shift. 'Looks like you have some work to do when you come in,' Szabo wrote in an email after an officer recorded only four tickets one day, according to the Tampa Bay Times. Szabo was suspended shortly after by City Manager Kim Worley after the Florida Department of Law Enforcement launched an investigation into another alleged violation of police procedure. His replacement, Cpl Kenneth Smith, stepped in, only to be hit with a FDLE investigation and suspension of his own. Smith was accused of using city video equipment to monitor his apartment and had a penchant for stealing towels at expensive hotels he enjoyed on the city's dime. Both Smith and Szabo resigned following their suspensions. After the vote, Officer Brandon Roberts was in good spirits for a man who had lost his job to his corrupt supervisors. Stay away: AAA called Waldo a 'traffic trap,' accusing police of ticketing for revenue generation, not safety of motorists . 'If I took down two bad ones, it was worth it,' he said. The town will now rely on the Alachua County Sheriff's Department for police services.","Waldo City Council voted 4-1 to dissolve the town's police force after investigations into police misconduct also turned up equipment upgrades the city couldn't afford .

And the incredible photos - from sitting on the back of an ostrich, lying peacefully with a young caracal, or dancing playfully with an elephant - show an unusual bond and tranquility between man and beast. 'She was so at ease with animals. She would talk to them with her eyes and her heart,' said Sylvie. Using her innocence and imagination, the young 'Mowgli' befriended one of the giants of the animal kingdom, Abu the African elephant. 'She had no fear,' said Sylvie. Watching the world go by: The young child relaxes with her meerkat friend . Time out:  Tippi rests on the trunk of  Abu the 34-year-old  elephant in Okavango Swamps, Botswana before leading him on a trip . Brother: The images show the young girl making friends with an elephant, who she calls her brother, and a leopard, her best friend . 'She did not realise she was not the same size as Abu the elephant. She would just speak to him like she would speak to me. They used to call her 'the little girl who would talk with animals.' Tippi was able to form strong bonds with some of the most dangerous beasts in the animal kingdom because they were used to humans. Most of the animals had been orphaned and raised by farmers. However, despite the apparent ease and comfort with which they interact, Sylvie always put Tippi's safety first. 'You can't just meet any of these animals and act like this with them,' explains Sylvie. 'Wild animals will either run away or attack you if they are either frightened, injured or need to protect their young.

'Mufasa came to Tippi and he friendly brushed her with his long tail, like a cat would do, and she almost fell down. I had to take her away - I was not at ease. 'But she was only ever bitten once on the nose by a Meerkat, only two bites! 'This is funny because Tippi's middle name is Okanti, meaning mongoose or meerkat. They were part of her family in Africa, so I wanted her to have something to take home with her.' 'The second incident was when she met with Cindy the baboon at a water point. Cindy attacked Tippi's hair and pulled out a handful, out of jealousy. 'That was terribly painful! Wild animals are unpredictable. We can't be sure of their reaction as we are not of the same species, we don't know all of their behaviour codes.

Cindy decided that she was in . charge of them and, being older, became like a grandma for the kids. 'They met each other and Cindy went to Tippi and started playing with her hair, grooming her. It was quite beautiful.' And it wasn't only the animals who were taken with the young Tippi, as Sylvie explains. 'When we came to a village with African children, within two minutes Tippi was the clown and people found her so cute,' she says. 'Africans love other children - especially white children and she was so much fun with her hair and so different. 'When we filmed the San Bushmen of northern Namibia (one of the most ancient people of Africa who live from hunting and gathering in the Kalahari desert) we would let Tippi spend the day with the group without us until she would fall asleep among. the kids. 'She was at ease with the children and would dress and play with them - she could never find the same when she came back to Europe.' When Tippi returned to her parents' native country - France - at the age of ten, it was hard adjusting to city life in Paris. 'She missed the animals so much,' said her mother Sylvie. 'We didn't have room for a dog in our flat, so we got a budgie instead. 'It . would go everywhere with her, even on the train, flying right by her . side, sitting on her head or falling asleep on her shoulder. 'She loved that little bird so much. He was the only friend she had.' Now aged 23 and studying her third year in a degree in cinema, Tippi is facing a different jungle ... the concrete one. But . the memories of her time in Africa - recorded in a series of interviews . and written up into the book - will forever live on through its pages. 'She gave her heart and thoughts away in her book,' said Sylvie.

"At least 100 families receiving housing benefit are living in luxury homes on handouts that could fund £1m mortgages, figures have revealed. More than 30 of those families are being given a staggering £1,500 a week to live 'swanky' lifestyles - more than three times the national average wage. Of the 100 families, 60 have their rent paid by the state to the value of £5,000 a month, according to the Department for Work and Pensions. At a time when millions of people are struggling to get on the housing ladder, the handouts would easily cover the monthly payments on a £1m mortgage. Luxury: The kind of upmarket homes in Kensington, west London, that the unemployed are being allowed to live in with £1,500 a week housing benefit handouts (file picture) The trendy white house in Notting Hill asylum seeker Abdi Nur rented with housing benefit. Right, the unemployed Somalian immigrant answers the door in his pyjamas when most people would be at work . Single mother Toorpakai Saiedi who lives in a £1.2m House in Acton . The handouts are allowing families to live in upmarket parts of London such as Kensington, Chelsea and Westminster alongside wealthy neighbours such as Roman Abramovich and George Michael. The figures have been criticised by campaigners and raised concerns that the Government's plan to cap housing benefit is not being enforced. Ministers announced last year that housing benefit, which currently costs the taxpayer £22billion every year, should be capped at £400 per week. However, the latest figures from the DWP show there are close to 5,000 families still claiming more than the £400 cap. Although almost four out of every five people on housing benefit pick up less than £100 each week. Public opinion has been riled by the cases of immigrants and asylum seekers who have been allowed to live in lavish flats at the expense of taxpayers. In 2010 it emerged that a family of Somalian asylum seekers were getting £1.2m a year to live in Kensington, West London - a short walk from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's new home in Kensington Palace. Nice wheels... how did you get them? Toorpakai's son Jawad Saindi, 21, pulls up to the family's £1.2million home in west London . Abdi Nur, 42, an unemployed bus conductor, his wife Sayruq, 40, and their seven children moved to the three-storey home in the fashionable area of the capital after complaining that their previous home had been in a 'poor' part of the city. In another case last year, a Somalian family moved from a house in Coventry to a £2m property in West Hampstead, north London. NORTH  EAST................................ £923.8m .

George Michael, Sienna Miller, Jude Law and Helena Bonham Carter. The extravagant lifestyle is one that the majority of hard-working families can only dream of. The figures will raise calls for the Government's benefit reforms to be bulldozed through the Commons - despite pleading from Liberal Democrats. The data, made public under the Freedom of Information Act, show the areas of the UK that pay out the most in housing benefit are Birmingham (£469million per year), Glasgow (£337m), Brent (£306m), Westminster (£281m), Hackney (£267m), Newham (£264m), Enfield (£258m), Haringey (£254m), Liverpool (£254m) and Manchester (248m). Emma Boon of the TaxPayers' Alliance said: 'This is further evidence that it is right to cap benefits. It is unfair to ask taxpayers to pay for swanky central London homes for others when they can't afford to live in those postcodes themselves. 'Many middle or low income families have to decide if they can afford to house their family in town, or if they have to move out to somewhere more affordable. It is not unreasonable to ask those on benefits to make the same choice.' The DWP says the new rules which have been put in place mean that those families currently getting more than £400-per-week will be gradually taken out of the system and moved into cheaper accommodation. A spokesman added: 'These figures underline exactly why our Housing Benefit reforms are so necessary'.","Thirty families receiving £6,000 a month and at least 60 families getting £5,000 a month .

"THE last time we endured a blistering hot summer it buckled railway lines, melted roads and had millions of us wilting. It might be worth warming up to the idea – because extreme heat will become the norm in the UK within 30 years, say forecasters. A Met Office report says heatwaves like that of 2003 – when temperatures soared to a record 101F (38.5C) – will happen every other year by the 2040s. Heatwave: The beatch in Margate, Kent, on August 6, 2003. Scientists expect powerful heatwaves such as the one that hit in 2003 to be commonplace by the 2040s. Sunny: Beaches were packed during the 2003 heatwave - pictured are . Southend-on-Sea in Essex (left) and Hyde Park (right), during the height . of summer 2005 . Hot hot hot: Children cool down in the mud on August 6, 2003 in Maldon, England, when the temperature in the UK peaked at 35.9C . Although it will pile pressure on the . health service, water supplies and farming, experts said it may also . mean a boom in products such as English wine as conditions improve for . heat-loving plants. Winters are also expected to become generally milder – with the occasional very cold one, as occurred in 2010. Professor . Stephen Belcher, head of the Met Office’s Hadley Centre, said: ‘At the . moment, we’re able to say that by the 2040s we can expect events like . 2003 to be normal.’ In fact by the end of the century, 2003 could even . be viewed as a cold summer if trends continue, he said. But . along with hotter summer months we could be heading for more frequent . heavy winter downpours. ‘Heavy rain is becoming heavier and that’s . consistent with our picture of a warming world and warming atmosphere,’ said Professor Belcher. Freezing: People will still have to plan for the occasional very cold winter, as occurred in 2011. The Angel of the North naer Gateshead is seen in December of that year . Extra cold winter: An elderly woman peers out from a bus shelter as dog walkers make their way through heavy snow fall in High Wycombe on December 16, 2011 . The report points to a combination of natural . processes and human influences on Britain’s changing climate. It blamed a . series of recent wet summers on natural climate variation, but said man . could be partly responsible for the blisteringly hot 2003. The report concluded: ‘The UK has seasonal weather that varies hugely from year to year due to natural processes. ‘Nevertheless, . human influence has been detected in the hot temperatures experienced . in Europe during the summer of 2003, and there are signs that the . character of rainfall has shifted in the last 50 years with slightly . more heavy rainfall events, consistent with a warmer atmosphere holding . more water. Flooding: Heavy downpours are becoming more frequent in the UK - a pattern likely to be linked to climate change. Moorland in Somerset is seen last month . Devastation: People look over flooded fields which persisted over farmland surrounding Burrowbridge in Somerset, earlier this year. This photo was taken in January . 'Other seasons, such as the cold winter of 2010/11 and the . wet summer of 2012 appear to be associated with natural fluctuations in . the UK’s varied climate.’ Professor . Andrew Challinor, from the University of Leeds, said warmer . temperatures could cause wheat yields to drop by up to ten per cent. But . there would also be more ‘opportunities’ for British farmers – who . would be able to grow new crops such as grapes and maize, he added. More . than 2,000 people are thought to have died of heat-related causes in . the UK in 2003, and 20,000 in the rest of Europe. Alongside traffic . chaos, hosepipe bans were imposed and rising demand for air conditioning . caused electricity ‘brownouts’.","More than half of summers by 2040s are likely to be hotter than in 2003 .

"The days of skiving behind your boss's back may be numbered, following the announcement of a new product that can track your every movement in the workplace. Electronics manufacturer Hitachi has unveiled a high-tech ID badge that not only tracks an employee's exact location within the office, it also keeps a record of all the other staff members they have spoken to, for how long and how energetically. Dubbed the Business Microscope, the device will also send an employer information on how much time each member of staff spends out of their seat - and even how long they have spent in the toilet. Business Microscope: Hitachi's high-tech ID badge tracks an employee's exact location within the office, sending their employer information on how long they spent out of their seat and where in the building they went . The business microscope is fitted with sensors that let it sync and interact . with other Business Microscopes within the company. These multiple sensor devices are placed inside a nameplate-type product that is attached to employees. When the name tag sensors come within a . specific distance of each other, they recognise each other and record . the face time, body and behaviour rhythm data to a server. It tracks an employee's exact . location within the office and also keeps a record of all the other . staff members they have spoken to. The device sends an employer information on how much time each member of staff spends out of their . seat - and even how long they have spent in the toilet. Business Microscope will also record how . energetically they have contributed to group meetings, where a high . level of enthusiasm. The information is used to create an 'organisation network diagram' based on the number of recordings. As well as being used to find out which employees spend their days aimlessly wandering around the office gossiping to friends, the Business Microscope will also record how energetically they have contributed to group meetings, where a high level of enthusiasm and animation can be a good thing. Although the product looks more like an ID badge or business card than a high-tech surveillance device, it actually contains complicated sensors that allow it to sync and interact with other Business Microscopes belonging to the company. A message posted on the Hitachi website said: 'Business Microscope uses senor technology to measure and analyse inner company communication and activities. Multiple sensor devices are placed inside a nameplate-type sensor that is attached to employees'. 'When the name tag sensors come within a specific distance of each other, they recognise each other and record the face time, body and behaviour rhythm data to a server'. The end of the water cooler moment? Hitachi's Business Microscope will allow employers to keep a record of how long and how energetically members of staff chat among themselves . Hitatchi said the technology was designed to help boost efficiency levels in the workplace and to help employers realise and react to problems that may otherwise have gone unnoticed. Perhaps recognising the product is unlikely to be popular among employees, including their own, Hitatchi adds that they hope it will help boost employee cooperation, leading to a better atmosphere. The Business Microscope is by no means the first surveillance device to be marketed towards employers for use in the workplace. Perhaps recognising the product is unlikely to be popular among their own employees, Hitatchi said it hopes the Business Microscope will improve the atmosphere in the workplaces around the world . Many companies already employ 'internet monitoring' software that scans sent and received emails, as well as monitoring the websites they visit over the course of the working day. These systems often automatically send alerts directly to the employer when company rules are believed to have been broken. And in 2008 Microsoft filed a patent for software that allowed workers to be tracked remotely, monitored their competence and productivity, and even measured personal information such as body temperature, blood pressure and facial expressions. It is believed Microsoft abandoned the product shortly after the patent was filed.","Hitachi's Business Microscope monitors staff movements around the office .

"This is the moment a mother arrived at her son’s school to find the distressed five-year-old with his hands tied behind his back - after 'acting up'. Alicia Cabrel used a mobile phone to take a video of her upset son Derick Marte restrained with Velcro straps and screaming at the PS 107 school in New York. She was told her child, who has ADHD, had become agitated when his gym session had come to an end and did not want to return to class. Scroll down for video . Video shows how five-year-old Derick Marte (pictured), who has ADHD, was restrained with Velcro straps by school safety agents after an outburst at his Bronx School . The video shows the child sitting on a chair with his hands behind his back and calling out. Ms Cabrel said she received a call during the day to say that there had been an outburst and that school officials had said they would call again if they needed her to come in. About 25 minutes later she got another call, she told abc7 News. But in the meantime her son was restrained with Velcro straps, something school safety agents are permitted to do in certain circumstances. He had been restrained for around 15 minutes when his mother arrived, abc7 News reports. The New York Police Department, which oversees the agents, said its officers reported that the youngster tried to bite one of the workers, had been lashing out and throwing objects and that he had become a danger to himself and others. Alicia Cabrel (pictured) used a mobile phone to take a video of her son Derick Marte restrained with Velcro straps and screaming at the PS 107 school in New York. But Ms Cabrel claims the Bronx school mishandled the situation and has hired an attorney in the hope the case will bring about changes in protocol. She questioned why she was not called earlier to come and calm her son. A psychologist has reportedly recommended Derick should now be home-schooled. She told abc7 News: ‘Nobody was injured. Usually when he gets his tantrums, I live across the street from the school. I can get there in less then five minutes. Why didn't you call me 30 minutes before he got to that point? ‘He wakes up in the middle of the night, scared, “Mommy, I don't want to go to school"".' Her attorney John O’Halloran told the broadcaster: ‘There's got to be a better way. If that's the system, we need to change that system to make it more friendly to the family and the parents.’ Abc7 News said the school principal has yet to respond to requests for a comment.","Alicia Cabrel took video of her son, 5, restrained and screaming at his school .

"Herman Cain brushed off sexual harassment claims brought against him in the 1990s that he says were later dropped as 'baseless,' as he said of one of the women: 'I don't even remember her name.' The 2012 presidential hopeful today revealed why one of two female employees accused him of sexual harassment while he was head of the National Restaurant Association in the 1990s. However, Cain came under fire for changing his story, stating in an interview with Fox News that a settlement was paid to one of the accusers. But in an earlier interview, the former Godfather's Pizza CEO said he knew of no such settlement. Scroll down for video . Under the microscope: Herman Cain appeared on Fox News Monday night to talk about the details of the sexual harrassment allegations brought against him . Denial: Herman Cain says he 'never sexually harassed anyone' while he was at the National Restaurant association . Meanwhile, he has labelled . allegations of sexually suggestive behaviour revealed in a Politico . report that threatens to trip up his run for Republican presidential candidate as 'false accusations'. The report alleged the women signed agreements with the group that gave them five-figure financial payouts to leave - but it allegedly barred them from discussing this. Neither woman was identified. 'I've never sexually harassed anyone and . I was falsely accused while I was at the National Restaurant . Association,' GOP presidential candidate Mr Cain told Fox News' Greta Van Susteren yesterday. Face off: Hermain Cain talked about the sexual harassment allegations tonight in an interview with Fox News's Greta Van Susteran . Denial: The GOP presidential candidate, pictured today, has labelled allegations of sexually suggestive behaviour revealed in a Politico report as 'false accusations' 'If the Restaurant Association did a settlement I wasn't even aware of it and I hope it wasn't for much because nothing happened.' 'She was in my office one day, and I made a gesture saying - and I was standing close to her - and I made a gesture saying you are the same height as my wife'- Herman Cain . Mr Cain told Fox News that . he remembered one incident where a female worker in her late 30s or early 40s . was upset with a gesture he made. ‘She was in my office one day, and I made a gesture saying - . and I was standing close to her - and I made a gesture saying you are the same . height as my wife,’ he told Van Susteren. ‘And I brought my hand up to my chin saying: “My wife comes . up to my chin”. And that was put in (the complaint) as something that . made her uncomfortable,' he said - reported the Washington Examiner. Mr Cain said that he recused himself as CEO of the National Restaurant Association after the first claim was filed, a claim which was later found to be 'baseless,' he said. He added: 'I have no idea who’s egging this on, who's on this witch hunt, but I am convinced - and my staff and I are is convinced - it's intended to distract us.' Married: GOP presidential candidate Herman Cain is pictured with his wife Gloria, who rarely makes public appearances with her husband . The report was based on anonymous . sources and what it said in one case was a review of documents describing the allegations and the resolution. 'Liberals are terrified of Herman Cain. He is a strong conservative black man... they are terrified of strong, . conservative, black men' - Ann Coulter . Republican commentator Ann Coulter told Fox News: 'Liberals are terrified of Herman Cain. He is a strong conservative black man... they are terrified of strong, conservative, black men.' But Politico's Jonathan Martin, who co-wrote the story, said the allegations include 'verbal and physical gestures'. 'In one case it involved, I think, inviting a woman up to a hotel room of Cain's on the road,' Mr Martin told MSNBC. Backing: Republican commentators Ann Coulter, left, and Rush Limbaugh, right, have criticised the report. Ms Coulter said: 'Liberals are terrified of Herman Cain. He is a strong conservative black man' But Mr Cain said he has never travelled with either of the accusers. In addition, his campaign said the allegations were not true and were an unfair attack. '(It's) an unconscionable, racially . stereotypical attack on an independent, self-reliant conservative black - . because for him that behavior is not allowed' Rush Limbaugh . 'Inside-the-Beltway media have begun to launch unsubstantiated personal attacks on Cain,' his spokesman JD Gordon said. 'Dredging up thinly sourced . allegations stemming from Mr Cain's tenure as the Chief Executive . Officer at the National Restaurant Association in the 1990s, political . trade press are now casting aspersions on his character and spreading . rumours that never stood up to the facts.' Republican commentator Rush Limbaugh said on his talk show the report was 'an unconscionable, racially stereotypical attack on an independent, self-reliant conservative black - because for him that behavior is not allowed'. Outsider: Cain has launched an unconventional campaign that last week saw him campaign in Alabama, which will not vote until way into next year . Mr Cain - a self-styled outsider . relatively new to the national stage - is facing a new level of scrutiny . after a burst of momentum in the GOP race. He's been steadily at or near the top . of national surveys and state polls, . competitive with former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney. 'The . story has been floating around for a long time, but (I) don’t know any . of the details,' Republican consultant Sal Russo told the Washington . Post. 'I have heard it both ways about whether it was anything egregious. So (we) have to wait and see.' The results of a poll by Iowa's respected Des Moines Register newspaper underline extreme shifts among Republican base voters. They gave Representative Michele Bachmann, an ultraconservative congresswoman from neighboring Minnesota, a victory in the Iowa straw poll in August - but quickly deserted her, leaving her to sink to the second tier of candidates. That happened after Texas Governor Rick Perry entered the race, shot to the top, then watched his support collapse after weak debate performances. Now it's businessman Mr Cain's turn at the top. Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts and a venture capitalist who lost the nomination in 2008 to Senator John McCain, has been holding steady in the polls at about 20 to 25 per cent support. Saturday evening's poll results showed Cain at the head of the pack, with the support of 23 per cent of respondents. Mr Romney came in just behind him at 22 percent. Texas Representative Ron Paul, a libertarian-leaning Republican, placed third at 12 per cent, followed by Mrs Bachmann at 8 per cent. Former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer told the Washington Post ex-president Bill Clinton's campaign 'survived this and much worse'. But Concerned Women for America president Penny Nance said: 'I think Herman Cain needs to directly answer the question. 'Early in my career I resigned from a trade association for the exact same reason and with no financial settlement,' she told Politico. 'I simply found another job.' The former pizza company executive has . been pointing to his long record in business to argue that he has the . credentials needed to be president during a time of economic strife. In its report, Politico said it . confronted Mr Cain early on Sunday outside of the CBS News Washington . bureau, where he had just been interviewed on 'Face the Nation.' 'I am not going to comment on that,' he told Politico when asked about one of the woman's claims. When asked if he had ever been accused . of harassment by a woman, Politico said he responded by asking the . reporter, 'Have you ever been accused of sexual harassment?' He had previously predicted that he would face character assassination throughout his campaign. 'They're going to come after me more viciously than they would a white candidate,' Mr Cain told the Washington Examiner in May. 'To use (black Supreme Court justice) Clarence Thomas as an example, I'm ready for the same high-tech lynching . that he went through - for the good of this country.' A message seeking comment from Peter . Kilgore, the National Restaurant Association's . chief legal counsel, was not immediately returned. 'I have never sexually harassed anyone, let's say that. Secondly, I've never sexually harassed anyone, and yes, I was falsely accused while I was at the National Restaurant Association - and I say falsely, because it turned out, after the investigation, to be baseless. The people mentioned in that article were the ones who would be aware of any misdoings, and they have attested to my integrity and my character. It is totally baseless, and totally false, never have I committed any sort of sexual harassment.'","Cain reveals he gestured to a woman she was the same height as his wife .

"A Muslim player was penalized for dropping to his knees in prayer after scoring a touchdown. Kansas City Chiefs safety Husain Abdullah received a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty after he dropped to the ground and performed the Sajdah in the fourth quarter of last night's game against the New England Patriots. Abdullah had just intercepted a pass from Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and returned it for a touchdown. Penalty: Kansas City Chiefs safety Husain Abdullah received a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty after he dropped to the ground and performed the Sajdah (above) during last night's game against the Patriots . Big play: Abdullah had just intercepted a pass from Patriots quarterback Tom Brady (above) and ran the ball back into the end zone . Mistake: The NFL said in a statement on Monday that Abdullah (above) should not have been penalized . The NFL, who could have fined Abdullah, released a statement early Monday morning about the incident. Michael Signora, the NFL Vice President of Football Communications, wrote on Twitter, 'Abdullah should not have been penalized. Officiating mechanic is not to flag player who goes to ground for religious reasons.' The rule that referees claimed Abdullah violated reads, 'Prolonged or excessive celebrations or demonstrations by an individual player. Players are prohibited from engaging in any celebrations or demonstrations while on the ground. A celebration or demonstration shall be deemed excessive or prolonged if a player continues to celebrate or demonstrate after a warning from an official.' According to Mike Pereira however, the former Vice President of Officiating in the NFL, players who pray after scoring a touchdown are not in violation of this rule. Pereira even explicitly said as much on his Twitter account in 2013, writing, 'you're not penalized for going to the ground to give praise after a TD.' Faith: Abdullah (above, with his son Jalaal) is a devout Muslim who fasts during Ramadan . Pilgrimage: Abdullah (above, with his son Jalaal) also sat out the 2012 season so he could visit Mecca during the Hajj in October . No response: Abdullah (above) has yet to comment on the call . Players praying after major plays and touchdowns has long been common in the NFL. In fact, former quarterback Tim Tebow prayed so frequently during games that the act of kneeling with one's head bowed and an arm resting on bent knee became known as 'Tebowing.' Tebow, who is a Christian, was never once penalized by the NFL for this action. Abdullah, who fasts during Ramadan and even sat out the entire 2012 season so he and his brother, former NFL safety Hamza Abdullah, could visit Mecca during the Hajj in October, has yet to respond to the controversy. But Husain's brother Hamza told MailOnline that the penalty should never have been given and blamed possible 'ignorance' on the part of the referee. Hamza, a former Denver Broncos safety, said that his brother was merely thanking his God for allowing him to ‘show off his gifts at such a high level’. He said: 'We have always tried to be good examples of what Muslims are about and try to bring out the best in Islam. I don't think it was (a case of) it's a Muslim celebration, we're going to fine him. 'Maybe it was a bit of not knowing, simply a bit of ignorance by the referee. He didn't know what Husain was doing. 'Maybe he thought he was going down to pull something out of his jersey... referees are human and make mistakes and he is erring on the side of being cautious'. Hamza urged the NFL to educate itself and said that, compared to the slew of recent stories about the league, him and his brother are a positive story. He said that his brother prays five times a day and so when he was score the touchdown and was on his knees, a position known by Muslim as Sajdah, it seemed natural to lower his head to the ground. Hamza, who like his brother has been a devout Muslim his whole life, said that when he saw his brother do this he thought it was 'beautiful'. He said: 'I thought he was representing the NFL, his family and his religion in the right way'. Asked if he thought the league was racist, Hamza said: 'I don’t think the NFL is that way'. Hamza also said that if a Christian player was given a penalty for doing something similar than his brother would feel that it was unfair to punish him too. Tebowing: Giving praise following touchdowns and major plays is common among many players in the NFL, most notably Tim Tebow (above) Penalty or not, Abdullah's touchdown still helped carry the Chiefs to a 41 - 14 victory over the Patriots. This of course comes at a time when the NFL is already under fire following their botched treatment of numerous abuse scandals involving players including Ray Rice, Adrian Peterson and Greg Hardy, to name just a few.","Husain Abdullah received a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty after he performed the Sajdah during Monday night's football game .
According to the former Vice President of Officiating in the NFL, giving praise after a touchdown does not qualify as unsportsmanlike conduct .
The NFL has since apologized for the call, saying Abdullah should not have been penalized ."
"Apple's iPhone 6 will have a virtually indestructible screen made of sapphire, it has been claimed. A YouTube videomaker claims to have acquired one of the screens - and has subjected it to a barrage of abuse, from stabbing it with a knife and keys to bending and twisting it. In the video, the screen emerges totally unscathed - raising hopes is could lead to a far more resilient handset from Apple. Scroll down for video . The iPhone 6 screen being repeatedly stabbed by a knife: The sapphire glass emerges unscathed from the video trial which also sees in being bent and scratched with keys . Synthetic sapphire is a hard, transparent material made of crystallising aluminium oxide, produced at high temperatures. As . the material is heated, it forms disks that can be sliced . using diamond-coated saws. These round disks are ground into shape, and . polished, to become glass. The technology is traditionally used in watch displays because it is thin, super-strong and scratch resistant. Apple already uses sapphire crystal in . the Touch ID fingerprint scanner on its latest iPhone 5S and to protects the phone's camera. As a result, sapphire glass could potentially replace Gorilla Glass currently used in most high-end smartphones. Marques Brownlee, a popular YouTube host claims to have got the screen from well known Apple leaker Sonny Dickson, who recently made his own video showcasing the screen. In the video he can be seen bending and twisting the screen. 'I slowly realized there is absolutely no way I can break this display under my own power,' he said. 'The worst blemish on the surface was actually my fingerprint marks and the dust from handling it so much.' The glass is also extremely high-quality, Brownlee noted: 'There’s absolutely no color shift while looking through the sapphire glass.' It is claimed the screen is made from sapphire crystal. Apple already uses a small amount of sapphire glass for the 'Home' button and camera lens in the iPhone 5S, but the rest of the current iPhone front display is made of Gorilla Glass. The new glass display is 'paper thin,' Brownlee said in his video. Brownlee shows his screen measures 4.7 inches diagonally, keeping with rumors that Apple will release two different-sized iPhones this year: A 4.7-inch model and 5.5-inch one. Reports Apple was experimenting with sapphire displays began last year, yet sources claimed at the time Apple found the technology ‘infeasible.’ In the video, Marques Brownlee stands on the thin screen and bends it. When released, it goes back it its normal shape, raising hopes the new handset will have an almost indestructible screen . The screen is also shown being repeatedly stabbed by a knife - and emerging with no scratches, although it has not been confirmed to be the 'official' screen that will feature in the new handset . This was because sapphire glass is more expensive to produce than normal screens. However, Apple recently announced plans to open a mineral plant in Arizona with sapphire glass experts GT Advanced Technologies. The facility is expected to employ around 700 people to manufacture sapphire crystal and sapphire glass, and this technology could make its way onto the screens of the next iPhone. The screen is described as 'paper thin'. It is claimed to be made from thin man-made layers of sapphire, which enables the material to be flexible, giving it a change of withstanding knocks and falls that shatter other types of toughened glass . In the video, the screen survived having keys scratched across its surface - a common problem for iPhone owners who keep their handsets in their pocket . In a statement about the announcement, GT Advanced Technologies said: ‘Although the agreement does not guarantee volumes, it does require GT to maintain a minimum level of capacity.’ While an Apple spokesman added: 'We are proud to expand our domestic manufacturing initiative with a new facility in Arizona, creating more than 2,000 jobs in engineering, manufacturing and construction. ‘This new plant will make components for Apple products and it will run on 100 per cent renewable energy from day one, as a result of the work we are doing with SRP to create green energy sources to power the facility.’ Earlier this week iPhone maker Foxconn revealed Apple's new iPhone 6 could be the first to be made using its 'robot army'. The firm has pledged to have a million robot workers by the end of the year - and CEO Terry Gou has revealed the robots, dubbed 'Foxbots', are in the final stages of testing. It is believed Foxconn will install 10,000 robots as a test. Workers are seen inside a Foxconn factory in the township of Longhua in the southern Guangdong province. The firm is believed to be installing thousands of robots to help build Apple's latest iPhone . Lines dedicated to Apple devices getting first priority, according to IT Home. It says Gou told a shareholder meeting that Apple would be the first company to take advantage of the new robot workers meaning that its next product - the iPhone 6 - will be manufactured in this way. Each $25,000 Foxbot can complete an average of 30,000 devices per year it has been claimed. Foxconn, which currently employs more than 1.2 million workers at its various factories across China. However, the firm's robot initiative has been delayed since it was first announced in 2011.

"Bull the cat has found himself homeless... for having the wrong sort of furry friends. In a bizarre saga which has gripped the town of Lafia, in Nigeria, the seven-year-old feline has been abandoned by his owner for being gay. The middle-aged woman claims that he has engaged in 'unnatural sexual behaviour', making advances towards other male cats in the house while shunning the females in the area. Out on his own: A woman in Nigeria has disowned her cat because she believes he's gay (file image) In further damning evidence, neighbours told Leadership that none of the other cats born while Bull was in the house had his colouring. They claim that this is because he is not doing his heterosexual best to continue the species. Bull’s owner, who has not been named, claims his actions are a ‘a contradiction of the laws of nature’ and has kicked him out of her house, saying ‘anybody interested in this gay cat can have it because I have no further use of it.’ As yet, no one has adopted the cat, but many residents of the area have been thronging to the house to see the spectacle, and have been cracking jokes about the incident. While Bull may be the first cat to be publically declared gay and disowned by his owner, he is not the first pet. In 2013, a Tennessee man sent his dog to an animal shelter to be put down after he suspected it of being gay. The dog found a new and more sympathetic owner just hours before he was to be destroyed.","Woman in Lafia, Nigeria, disowns her pet of seven years for being gay .

"New French president Francois Hollande launched an outspoken attack last night on Britain’s obsession with protecting the City of London from Brussels-inspired legislation. As David Cameron warned that the single currency is in ‘extreme trouble’, the socialist victor suggested that Britain is ‘indifferent to the fate of the euro area’ and ‘attentive only to the interests of the City’. This is despite the fact that billions of pounds of UK taxpayers’ money is already being used to prop up the basket-case currency. Scroll down for video . France's outgoing president Nicolas Sarkozy, right, shakes hands with president-elect Francois Hollande, left, before a ceremony marking the 67th anniversary of the Allied victory over Nazi Germany in World War II . Mr Hollande, who campaigned against austerity measures designed to save the euro, went on to threaten the UK with new Europe-wide taxes to neuter the City of London. He signalled his support for an EU-wide transaction tax on financial deals and a fresh push for tax harmonisation – both of which are fiercely opposed by the British government. The combination of Mr Hollande’s socialist demands for an end to austerity across Europe with political and economic turmoil in Greece pitched the continent back into crisis yesterday. Panic selling sent shares and the euro into free fall in early trade before losses were clawed back in a late rally on a rollercoaster day across Europe. The euro fell to a three-and-a-half year low of 80.44p against the pound and a three-month low of $1.2955 against the dollar before recovering. Mr Sarkozy and Mr Hollande put aside their differences as they walk past the Arc de Triomphe in Paris as part of the memorial celebrations today . Mr Sarkozy touches his successor on the shoulder as they walk through the streets of Paris. Despite the closeness, their will be deep divisions in their view of France's economic policy . Shares around Europe were hammered in early trading before bouncing back as investors digested the news from Paris and Athens. On a dramatic day across the . eurozone, the Greek stock market plunged nearly seven per cent. But shares . in Germany made small gains while France closed up nearly 2 per cent and . Italy and Spain were more than 2.5 per cent higher. Experts raised the prospect that . Greece will fall out of the euro after 60 per cent of voters there . backed parties opposed to austerity measures which have been demanded in . exchange for massive bailouts by the international community. To make matters worse, Mr Hollande placed himself on a collision course with both Britain and Germany. Following his victory over Nicolas Sarkozy on Sunday night, he boldly announced: ‘Austerity can no longer be inevitable!’ There's work to do: French President Francois Hollande waves from the balcony of the Socialist Party headquarters . Difference of opinion: Mr Cameron will make plain his frustration with the chaos in Europe today, as Angela Merkel, right, continues to insist that austerity measures must stay in place . But yesterday German Chancellor Angela Merkel made clear that her government will not renegotiate the terms of the eurozone’s deal to save the single currency – which calls for austerity measures in exchange for bailout cash. ‘From our point of view, a new negotiation of the fiscal compact is not possible,’ said Mrs Merkel’s spokesman. Her parliamentary party leader Volker Kauder added: ‘Germany is not here to finance French election promises.’ Mr Hollande will make his first . foreign visit as president to Berlin. But he will not see Mr Cameron . until the end of next week at the G8 summit at Camp David. It is likely . to be a tense affair. In an interview with the French-language version of the Slate website, he condemned Britain’s approach to the euro crisis. Mr . Hollande made clear he resents Britain remaining outside the single . currency because the Bank of England – unlike the European Central Bank – . has been able to print money to keep the economy afloat. He . said: ‘In addition to relative indifference to the fate of the euro . area, Britain is more protected because of speculation the central bank . may intervene directly to finance the debt.’ ‘Europe is not a . cash box, let alone a cashpoint.’ Mr Hollande then went further by . making clear that he would fight Britain over new EU taxes. ‘The British have been particularly shy about the issues of financial regulation, and attentive only to the interests of the City – hence their reluctance to see the introduction of a tax on financial transactions and tax harmonisation in Europe.’ The woman who opened the Sangatte refugee camp is the hot favourite to become France's next prime minister . The French president also made clear . he is at odds with Mr Cameron over austerity. While the PM will insist . in a speech later today that the UK sticks to the same economic course, . Mr Hollande is demanding more . borrowing to stimulate the economy. ‘Everyone admits that austerity alone cannot return balance to the public accounts,’ he said. Mr Hollande offered just one olive branch, saying he would meet Mr Cameron for talks on defence and industrial co-operation. ‘I . will meet David Cameron soon to discuss the benefits of further . co-operation between our two countries on the industrial plan. We are . committed to continued defence rapprochement.’ Asked . whether he speaks English, he replied: ‘Yes, but I am attached to the . French language. I will defend the ubiquitous use of French.’ The charge that the government is . ‘indifferent to the fate of the euro’ comes despite Mr Cameron and . Chancellor George Osborne repeatedly saying that a stable euro is good . for Britain, not least because 40 per cent of Britain’s exports are to . the euro area. What is . more, Britain has poured more than £12billion into bailouts for bankrupt . euro nations such as Ireland and Portugal, and £40billion in loans to . the International Monetary Fund to help pay for Greece’s bailouts. Despite . Mr Hollande’s ebullient tone, the greatest crisis last night was . affecting Greece, where extremist parties are on the brink of power . after mainstream parties who back the terms of the current bailouts . failed to form a government. The Prime Minister will use a speech alongside Nick Clegg to point out that the chaos afflicting the single currency is dragging Britain’s economy down as well. ‘I know that the task of driving our economy forward when faced with the headwinds that are blowing in from the eurozone is a formidable one,’ he will say. Amid heightened tensions within the coalition following last week's drubbing in the local elections, the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister will declare their determination to work together and do 'whatever needs doing to succeed'. The so-called renewal of their 'marriage vows' marks the start of a crucial week for the Government, with the announcement tomorrow in the Queen's Speech of the legislative programme for the new parliamentary session. In contrast to their initial appearance together two years ago in the Downing Street rose garden, Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg will set out their renewed commitment to work together against the more prosaic backdrop of a factory in Essex. The tone too will be altogether more sombre, with the Prime Minister warning that the damage done in the financial crash of 2008 was 'greater than anyone thought', while Mr Clegg will liken it to a 'giant heart attack'. Mr Cameron will stress that their 'number-one priority' was still to keep Britain safe from the financial storm raging in the eurozone and to rescue the economy from the 'mess' left by the last Labour government. 'That was and remains our guiding task and in these perilous times it's more important than ever for Britain that we stick to it,' he is expected to say. Still together: Prime Minister David Cameron, right, and Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg, will renew their 'marriage vows' two years after their first speech together in the Downing Street rose gardens in 2010 . 'I don't hide from the scale of that challenge - or from the message sent by voters in many places in last week's elections. I'm listening. I'm leading. I get it. There are no closed minds, no closed doors in Downing Street. 'I know that the task of getting driving our economy forward when faced with the headwinds that are blowing in from the eurozone is a formidable one. 'But this Government is determined to do whatever needs doing to succeed.' In his remarks, Mr Clegg will dismiss claims the coalition has an 'ideological obsession' with shrinking the size of the state, arguing there was a 'clear moral responsibility' to deal with the deficit and not leave it to future generations. 'Ducking the tough choices would only prolong the pain, condemning the next generation to decades of higher interest rates, poorer public services and fewer jobs,' he is expected to say. 'We are taking the tough choices not because we want to, but because we have to - any government would have to do the same.' At the same time he will emphasise the need to restore economic growth, calling for more to be done to get credit flowing to business and to lever private sector investment into major infrastructure projects. 'Two years in and building the new economy remains the coalition's biggest challenge and while the deficit is part of that - it is only a means to an end,' he will say. 'This Government is galvanised around growth. We owe it to the next generation to get it right.'","French socialist election victor says Cameron is indifferent to euro fate .

"This is the moment a wild grey seal appeared to be enjoying a hilarious joke - as it was photographed laughing uproariously.

"If Phil Collins has taught us anything, it is that You Can't Hurry Love - especially when its a love of collecting historical artifacts from a Wild West battle almost 180 years ago. After spending his life scouring the earth for memorabilia from the Battle of the Alamo, the Genesis singer appears to have finally completed his quest ... and is donating the trove to a Texas museum. The 63-year-old Genesis singer-drummer joked he'd spent 'all the money that I made from music' on 200-plus pieces related to the battle where 1,500 Mexican troops laid siege to 200 Texans in 1836. The Alamo: After spending his life scouring the earth for memorabilia from the Battle of the Alamo, the Genesis singer appears to have finally completed his quest ... and is donating the trove to a Texas museum . Homecoming: Collins made the announcement under the shadow of the Alamo itself in Texas . 'Some people would buy Ferraris, some . people would buy houses, I bought old bits of metal and old bits of . paper,' Collins said. 'It's at my home, in my basement in Switzerland. I . look at it every day, but no one else was enjoying it.' Collins . has been an Alamo aficionado since growing up in London and watching . actor Fess Parker portray Davy Crockett in 1955 Disney miniseries, 'Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier'. The series chronicled the frontier legend of Crockett, who eventually died as one of the defenders of the Alamo. 'I've . had a love affair with this place since I was about 5 years old,' said . Collins, who sweated in a button-down shirt and spectacles before a . cheering crowd of dignitaries and tourists who gathered in front of the . Alamo for the occasion. 'It was something that I used to go and play in . the garden with my soldiers.' Last stand: The 'last stand' at the Alamo on March 6, 1836 came after a small band of Americans held out for 13 days against the army of Mexican dictator General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna (pictured: a painting of the battle which hangs at the museum) Lifelong passion: Collins, 63, said he became fascinated with the Alamo story when he was growing up in the 1950s watching the television series 'Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier' starring Fess Parker (right) as the eponymous hero (pictured with co-star Buddy Ebsen) Collins . said his favorite artifact was also his first, purchased for him in the . 1990s by his then-wife: a receipt for the sale of the saddle of John W. Smith, an Alamo messenger who rode through Mexican lines and pleaded . for reinforcements before the battle. The collection also includes a rifle owned by Crockett, his leather shot pouch and a pair of powder horns Crockett is believed to have given to a Mexican officer before his death — as well as muskets and musket balls that belonged to Mexican soldiers. Cherished: For 178 years, the Battle of the Alamo has been one of America's most cherished historical events and has been re-enacted in film on numerous occasions, including in the 2004 movie, The Alamo (pictured) Another important relic is Jim Bowie's famous knife with which he is reputed to have fought tirelessly, killing many Mexicans during the onslaught. It was after him that the Bowie knife was named. In 2012, the year after he announced . his retirement from music because of health problems caused by drumming, . Collins wrote a 384-page book, The Alamo and Beyond: A Collector's . Journey. For 178 years, the Battle of the Alamo has been one of America's most cherished historical events. Celebrated . in song, story and cinema, the story of heroism against all the odds . helped define the young nation's pursuit of liberty. The 'last stand' at the Alamo on March 6, 1836 came after a small band of Americans held out for 13 days against the army of Mexican dictator General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna. The leaders of the group included Davy Crockett (pictured), already famous as a frontiersman, storyteller and crack shot, and James Bowie, known for his distinctive knife. It has long been part of the Alamo legend that Crockett died fighting. News of the resistance helped garner support among the rebels, who defeated Santa Anna's army at the Battle of San Jacinto amid cries of 'Remember the Alamo!' The historic victory cemented the status of the newly formed Republic of Texas. The legend was firmly established by the 1955 Disney TV show in which the hero was seen swinging an empty rifle as the hordes of Mexican soldiers closed in for the kill. It has since been the subject of a host of Hollywood movies, including a 1960 John Wayne epic and a . 2004 version with Dennis Quaid and Billy Bob Thornton. He added: 'I'm . just an enthusiastic amateur. What I know is out there to be learned, . it's just that I took the time to do it, because of the book and to find . out what I was buying.' Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson said Collins would pay to ship the artifacts to Texas with the understanding that the state would use public funding and private donations to eventually spruce up the Alamo site — including erecting a building to house the collection. In the meantime, some items will be displayed as soon as October. The collection is worth millions but Collins said, 'Being British, we don't talk about that kind of thing.'He promised to keep buying artifacts and 'once I've lived with whatever I buy for a month, I'll ship it over here.' He told the Guardian: 'I'm not extravagant in other ways, I live a very simple . life. Pretty simple. I mean, I came down here from New York in a private . plane so it's not that simple. But on the other hand, I don't buy . extravagant items like cars, expensive houses, jewellery. I've got no . other expensive interests. My interests, for the last 25 years anyway, . have been relics, buying things that are attached to something that I . feel very interested about. Even I have a limit … I was offered . something once for a million dollars.' He said his love affair with the battle itself centred on the fact that 'people came here and made a stand here – for good or bad'. 'That's another . political can of worms,' he told the paper. 'But for good or bad they came here knowing . they were going to die, hoping they weren't but knowing they probably . would, and that appealed to me even at six or seven, the idea of being . that brave.' Collins mostly retired from music in 2011 but first came to the Alamo in 1973, while on his first U.S. tour with Genesis. He, singer Peter Gabriel and the tour manager had three days off and each got to pick a destination. Gabriel picked Hot Springs National Park in Arkansas and Collins chose San Antonio. 'I was just spellbound when I first saw it in person,' he recalled. 'Having lived all my life, to see it in books and movies and the pictures in magazines, it was really quite extraordinary.'

"Violence exploded on the streets of Kiev again yesterday as clashes between riot police and protesters plumbed new depths of savagery. The bodies of 20 civilians lay strewn on the ground after riot police were authorised to use live ammunition in place of rubber bullets. There were reports of snipers firing at protesters. And, in a chilling twist, the demonstrators took at least 67 police officers hostage, according to Ukraine’s interior ministry. As many as 70 are believed to have died and up to 500 injured – on what was supposed to be a day of mourning for those killed earlier this week. A protest doctor told AP that at least 70 protesters were killed Thursday and over 500 were wounded in the clashes - and that the death toll could well rise further . Protesters burn as they stand behind barricades during clashes with police on Thursday . Grim toll: Activists pay respects to protesters who were killed in clashes with police . Protesters hurled petrol bombs and paving slabs at police in a three-hour battle to recapture Independence Square, where former hotels have become makeshift mortuaries. Just hours earlier President Viktor Yanukovych had agreed a truce with opposition leaders ‘with the aim of ending bloodshed’. But after the Ukrainian leader met an EU delegation of German, Polish and French foreign ministers to discuss a ‘road map’ to peace, demonstrators held police captive in Kiev’s occupied city hall. The country’s parliament building and the foreign ministry were evacuated because of fears that protesters would storm them. Last night, the EU imposed sanctions on senior Ukrainian figures as Foreign Secretary William Hague condemned the violence as ‘utterly unacceptable and indefensible’. Prime Minister David Cameron made an urgent telephone call to Russian president Vladimir Putin urging him to get behind the plan for negotiations put forward by the European foreign ministers in Kiev.

Explosive: Police take cover behind shields as anti-government protesters throw flares at them in Kiev's Independence Square . The opposition is insisting on Yanukovych's resignation and an early election while the embattled president is apparently prepared to fight until the end . A Downing street spokesman said: ‘The Prime Minister agreed with President Putin that they should both encourage all sides in Ukraine to get behind this emerging plan as a way to end the violence and open the way to a lasting peaceful solution.’ As the carnage intensified yesterday, footage on Ukrainian television showed protesters being cut down by gunfire amid the burning wreckage of the city’s streets. At least 21 bodies were counted on the edge of the smouldering protest encampment in central Kiev and one policeman had been shot 28 times, according to reports. Dozens of bullet-riddled bodies were seen by reporters laid out in white sheets on the marble floors of hotels around Independence Square, known as Maidan. As support for President Yanukovych began to crumble, there were reports of his family and top officials leaving the country with suitcases of cash. There were varying estimates of the death toll yesterday. But Dr Oleh Musiy, the top medical coordinator for the opposition, said at least 70 demonstrators were killed and more than 500 injured. It was reported that 28 were killed and more than 500 wounded in fighting earlier this week. Riot police fire at anti government demonstrators on the Independence square in Kiev .

The government blamed the opposition, saying the ‘calls for a truce and dialogue were nothing but a way of playing for time to mobilise and arm militants from Maidan’. But opposition leaders called the violence ‘an act of provocation’ by the authorities. This week’s clashes are the most deadly since protests began peacefully three months ago when Yanukovych abandoned closer ties with Europe in favour of Russia. Ukraine is a nation of 46million, ethnically divided between Ukrainians who favour closer ties with Europe, and Russians who prefer links to Moscow. The president opted to sign a deal with Russia, who offered a multibillion-pound bailout for Ukraine’s severe economic problems, rather than sign a trade deal with Europe.

Medics tend to a gravely wounded anti-government protester in the lobby of the Hotel Ukraine, which has been converted to a medical clinic and makeshift morgue . Protesters are calling for the resignation of Yanukovych and early elections, but the embattled leader was fighting on last night despite signs that his empire was crumbling. Leading figures left his party and troops were reported to have supplied protesters with weapons, while senior party members said he had ‘completely lost control of the situation’. European Union foreign ministers have agreed to impose sanctions on those ‘suspected of violence against anti-government protesters’. Mr Hague said yesterday: ‘Of course we call on all involved to turn away from violence, but some people are responsible for the violence and so we have decided to introduce targeted measures and targeted sanctions involving visa bans and asset freezes on those individuals who are responsible.’ Earlier the Ukrainian ambassador to London, Volodymyr Khandogiy, was summoned to the Foreign Office for the second time to be told that action to crush the protests was ‘unacceptable’.

One is . scheduled for completion next year and could cost less than $2 million, according to Forbes, reports CBS Las Vegas. The magazine quotes Dustin Sanders, Titan’s chief electrical engineer, as saying, 'We’re trying to do a single-million-dollar-per-aircraft platform. And the operation cost is almost nothing — you’re paying some dude to watch the payload and make sure the aircraft doesn’t do anything stupid.' Titan’s website says it has orders for three of the Solara 50s and one of the Solara 60s. Although they have not divulged who placed the order Breaking Defense website speculates the most obvious customers for the Solara in the defense and intelligence world would be the CIA, NRO and NGA. Chief Technology Officer Max Yaney, told Breaking Defense, early discussions had been held with some of the intelligence agencies. To illustrate how responsive the aircraft are Mr Yaney told the website that two planes could be positioned in a satellite orbit at either end of the United States and if needed in an emergency they could be repositioned to take photos, provide 4G cell coverage or help with mapping. Pioneering: Mr Yaney said of the Solari series: 'This is the holy grail of edge-of-space access...' Future: Chief Technology Officer Max Yaney, told Breaking Defense, early discussions had been held with some of the intelligence agencies . Functions: They are designed to be cheaper than the cost of a satellite, while carrying out similar functions such as surveillance, crop-monitoring, weather and disaster oversight, or any other monitoring that low-altitude satellites track . New beginnings: The Solara series differ from the more traditional drones developed such as the Predator drone, right,  which is powered by an engine, driven by a propeller, can fly up to 400 nautical miles (740 km) to a target, loiter overhead for 14 hours, then return to its base . Mr Yaney told Flight Global: 'We've been developing this for a number of years.' 'Obviously . there are some very exciting programmes that have been attempted over . the years. This is the holy grail of edge-of-space access.... We've . taken the lessons learned from all of those programmes'. 'We . make heavy use of the latest and greatest composite materials and . advanced composite techniques developed over recent years,' Yaney . continues. 'There are . actually fantastic advances in composites that allow us to meet the . strength and weight requirements. We employ the entire spectrum.' The Solara series differ from the more traditional drones developed such as the Predator drone, which is powered by an engine, driven by a propeller, can fly up to 400 nautical miles (740 km) to a target, loiter overhead for 14 hours, then return to its base.","The Solara aircraft measures 60 metres wide, and has a cruising speed of 65pmh .

"A former paramedic who converted to Islam and joined a militant cell could be the Volgograd train station suicide bomber according to investigators. The new prime suspect has been identified as Pavel Pechyonkin, and not 26-year-old woman Oksana Aslanova as was previously believed. Police now think that Pechonkin, who left to join Dagestani militants in 2011, carried out the devastating attack which killed 17 people on Sunday. Scroll down for videos . Pavel Pechyonkin, who investigators believe carried out the suicide bombing in Volograd . Smiling Pechyonkin made the video in response to an appeal from his desperate parents . Pechyonkin's parents Nikolair (left) and Fanaziya (right) made a desperate appeal for their son to come home earlier this year . The Muslim convert posted a video on . Youtube saying that he was following God's will, that he would not turn . back and that he working to earn a place in heaven. His . video was in response to a message from his parents Nikolai and . Fanaziya, begging him not to use violence and described their lives as . 'hell' without him. Pavel's father Nikolai tearfully appealed to his son to return home, and continue in his medical role . A medical school graduate, his father Nikolai spoke about his conversion: 'My son changed for the better. He stopped arguing with me, did not drink, went to the mosque. I bought him Halal meat.' Then following a visit to Moscow, he vanished six months ago. His parents heard he had gone 'in the forest' with rebels and made an internet appeal for him to return. CCTV footage shows the moment before the blast ripped through the station, killing at least 16 people . Moments later the blast obscures everything from view as sparks fly in front of the camera . 'Pasha, come back, let your hands be on blood from wounds, injuries, and not from kills, you're a doctor,' said his father. He replied about his parents' video appeal:  'It was sad to see your tears, very sad. I didn't even want to watch.  I thought it would weaken me. I came here so Allah would be pleased with me, to earn my way to paradise.' His parents travelled to Dagestan, hoping to find their son and rescue him from the militants they believe indoctrinated him. The . Moscow Times reported that his mother said: 'Imagine that somebody were . to kill your parents, how would that make you feel? Why are you turning . children into orphans?' Pechyonkin told his parents that he had then decided he would not be swayed. He said: 'I didn't want to watch your appeal, I thought that it would weaken me, that it would make me softer.' He . added: 'Why should we follow those Christian commandments, when Allah, . may he be glorified, urges us to fight those kafirs [unbelievers]. 'Why shouldn't we leave their children orphaned?' It is believed that investigators will take DNA from Pechyonkin's father to see if it is a match to tissue found at the scene. 17 people are known to have died in the blast, with more than 50 left injured. Witness . Alexander Koblyakov said: ‘People were lying on the ground, screaming . and asking for help. I helped carry out a police officer whose head and . face were covered in blood. He couldn’t speak.’ Explosion: CCTV footage capture the blast at Volgograd train station on Sunday . Blast scene: Debris is scattered across the steps of the train station after the blast, which killed 18 people . Casualty: A man lies outside the station as emergency services attend the incident . Wounded: A man, who has sustained injuries to his head, arrives at hospital following the blast . Vladimir . Markin, a spokesman for Russia’s Investigative Committee, said:  ‘A . suicide bomber who was approaching a metal detector saw a law . enforcement official and, after growing nervous, set off an explosive . device.’ More than 40 people were reported as injured and the death toll could rise, according to Russian officials. The . attacker was originally named as Oksana Aslanova, who had twice . married separatist Muslim gang leaders from the troubled Caucasus . region, sources said. She . had been on Russia’s wanted list for 18 months before the attack which . used 16lb of TNT, the deadliest in Russia for three years. The bomb was the equivalent to at least 10kg of TNT, said to Committee spokesman Vladimir Markin, and was stuffed with metal shrapnel. President . Vladimir Putin has reportedly instructed special flights to be laid on . to airlift the injured to Moscow clinics if necessary. Metal . detectors have been mandatory in railway stations and airports . throughout Russia since a suicide bomber killed 37 people at Domodedovo airport in 2011. This man, whose hands and face have been bandaged after the blast, was also wounded in the explosion . Body: A victim lies in front of the station entrance as officials survey the damage . Deadly: The attack had heightened concerns in Russia over the security of the upcoming Sochi winter Olympics . Footage from a CCTV camera facing the . station showed the moment the bomb went off, with a bright orange flash . emerging from inside the station followed by billowing smoke. 'Someone . tried to get inside the train station but was not allowed in,' an . unidentified law enforcement official told Vysota 102, a local news . agency. 'After that an explosion went off.' Among the dead was a police officer checking people entering the train station and a child, The Moscow Times reports. Local media reports claim taxi drivers queuing for customers outside the station were the first respondents to the emergency. Volgograd . mayor, Irina Guseva said the drivers were able to save lives by taking . injured victims to hospital before ambulances arrived at the scene. The . attack comes months after Chechen rebel leader Doku Umarov called for . new attacks against civilian targets in Russia, including the 2014 Games . which will take place in Sochi. No one has yet taken responsibility for the attack that took place this morning at a city centre train station . Last month a female suicide bomber killed six people on a bus that was travelling in the same city . A female suicide bomber killed six people on a bus in the same city in October .

"A young woman ripped from the jaws of a deadly crocodile has spoken of her miraculous recovery following the horrific ordeal. Pretty Tara Hawkes was grabbed by the monster croc while paddling with friends in a freshwater pool near Dugong Bay, in the north of Western Australia. The 23-year-old had been working aboard luxury cruiser, True North, on April Fool's Day this year, when she decided to cool off in the water. Survivor: Tara Hawkes was ripped from the jaws of a deadly crocodile that attacked her while she was paddling with friends in a freshwater pool in Western Australia . Wounds: The cuts were so deep the pool ran red and Tara feared she would lose her leg (left). She was airlifted to hospital in the cruise ship's helicopter (right) What should have been a relaxing dip soon turned into a nightmare for the hostess when she felt the crocodile grab her left leg with excruciating force. Tara, from Vasse in Western Australia, said she realised immediately what had happened. She said: 'I felt this impact on my leg and I was pulled under water. Straight away I knew it was a crocodile. 'I managed to get my head up and scream 'croc' and then this giant dragged me under again. He was playing with me like I was a teddy bear. 'I got my head above water again and this time I was swearing and saying get this thing off me. I was just screaming for help. 'I couldn't feel any pain but I could see his teeth sinking into my leg. 'I thought I was going to die. I could only see about four centimetres of the top of my leg and the rest was in the croc's gob.' Beast: Saltwater crocodiles usually wait for their prey to get close to the water's edge before striking and use their incredible strength to drag them into the water . Brave: Tara with 'Big Al', her friend and the man who tackled a vicious crocodile with his bare hands to save her life . Tara's friend and colleague, Al Sartori, was watching on from the shore and thought Tara was playing an April Fools prank. However, the 35-year-old, who had checked the 3x5m pool for danger beforehand, soon realised it was no joke when Tara continued to scream and the water filled with blood. Al, who is known as Big Al, stepped in to help Tara and with the help of bystander, Mike Fletcher, wrestled the giant three-metre crocodile. Al prised open its colossal jaws until Tara was eventually freed. Rescue: Tara tied a t-shirt around her wound and was airlifted to hospital on the luxury vessel's helicopter . He said: 'It was April Fools day and for a moment I thought Tara was winding us up. 'However soon I saw the crocodile on top of her. I jumped into the water and on to its back and stuck my thumbs into its eyes until I felt it start to slacken off. 'Tara was bleeding pretty heavily. I picked up the croc and chucked it back into the water and it came back at me. It was pretty heavy. 'I wouldn't ever want to do it again. I'm just glad I took the chance to try and save her.' Brave: Tara suffers panic attacks from her ordeal but recently came face-to-face with a croc to confront her fears and made her peace with the reptiles . Tara added: 'It was a massive crocodile and Alan had his fingers in its mouth, trying to open it. 'But crocodiles have lockjaw and even if you're the strongest man in the world you could not pull a crocodile's mouth apart. 'My leg was in the air and I was punching the croc on the nose but I was powerless to do anything. 'I looked at Alan and realised my life was in his hands and there was nothing I could do but stay strong.' After realising the true horror of what was happening, videographer Mike Fletcher jumped into the pool and held Tara's head above water just as the crocodile prepared for a death roll. Tara said: 'Al stuck his thumbs back deeper into its eyes and it released its grip a little bit and I managed to get my leg out with the help of Mike. 'I looked at my leg and it had been ripped to pieces. I thought I had a chance of losing my leg at that stage.' Tara bravely wrapped a t-shirt and some towels around her mangled leg to try and suppress the bleeding. Alan and Mike then put Tara in a dinghy and they sped back to True North where the crew were waiting anxiously. Tara was airlifted to a hospital where surgeons spent the next four hours desperately trying to piece her leg back together. Both Big Al and Mark have since won awards for their selfless acts from the Royal Life Saving Society's Western Power Bravery Awards. Meanwhile, despite still suffering panic attacks, Tara has made a miraculous recovery after undergoing seven months of intense physiotherapy and treatment for Post Traumatic Stress. Brave Tara even recently visited crew on True North and confronted her fears at a wildlife park where she came face-to-face with a crocodile. She said: 'Seeing that croc I thought it was actually a beautiful creature. I wanted to pat him. 'I owe Al my life. I don't know how to thank him enough. 'I still think I must have had someone looking over me that day, my pop or my nanna or someone close to me who was looking after me. 'But maybe that's just the way life is and I was just the luckiest girl in the world.' Dugong Bay is a popular beauty spot in Western Australia . True North, the luxury cruise boat Tara was working on in Dugong Bay in Western Australia . Scenery: Dugong Bay is a magnificent natural harbour popular with holidaymakers . Mr Peter Carstairs, from Western Australia's Department of the Environment and Conservation, said Miss Hawkes was taking a swim in a fresh water pool in an area known for crocodiles. 'It was not far from the salt water area and as she was exiting the water she was grabbed by a crocodile,' said Mr Carstairs. 'She received lacerations and puncture wounds from the attack.' He said the crocodile was still in the area and he urged others not to swim there. 'That area's very well known for crocodiles, so I think removing people from the environment instead of removing the crocodile from the environment sounds like a good idea.'","Tara Hawkes was savaged by a crocodile in Western Australia .

"For ten months, he had been lying in a hospital bed, unconscious and unresponsive. The injuries Mathew Taylor had suffered in a motorbike crash were so severe that his devastated family were warned he may never wake up. But then came the phone call that would change everything. From her home in Bali 7,000 miles away, Mr Taylor’s fiancee  Handayani Nurul chatted to him – and at the sound of her voice, tears began trickling down his cheek. True love: Mathew Taylor showed the first signs of life since his accident when his Balinese fiancee Anda Nurul spoke to him down the phone . Heady days: The couple fell in love and got engaged after Mr Taylor moved to Indonesia to teach English . Miss Nurul was forced to return home to Bali after a three-month visa ran out . It was the first time the 31-year-old had shown any sign of recovery since fracturing his skull in the . horrific accident on the Indonesian island. Now, every time the phone rings, Mr Taylor reaches out his hand. Describing the moment Mr Taylor first . responded to his fiancee’s voice, his stepfather Simon Moore said: ‘He . had tears in his eyes as we held the phone to his ear. She asked him . something and he said a silent yes. ‘Then tears were coming down his face. It  was brilliant.’ Now, Mr Taylor’s mother Heather calls Miss Nurul, known as Anda, and passes the phone towards her son. Mr Moore said: ‘As soon as he hears . her  voice he lifts his hand for the phone. He listens to her and you . can see this change in him.’ Mr Taylor, from Overseal, Derbyshire, met . Miss Nurul, 27, after he moved to Indonesia in 2009 to teach English. The couple planned to get married, but Mr Taylor was knocked down while riding a motorcycle in Bali on July 9 last year. As well as a fractured skull, he had to have his eye socket reconstructed, using bone taken from his thigh. Following surgery, he slipped into a coma and has remained in a vegetative state ever since. Mr Taylor had no medical insurance, . so  his family were forced to raise £100,000 for  him to be treated in . Bali. His father, Darrell Taylor, contributed £50,000 of his savings, . while Mr Moore remortgaged his home to find the remaining £50,000. Mr Taylor, 31, moved to Indonesia 18 months before his horrific motorbike accident . Emotional moment: It was Ms Nurul's voice that triggered Mr Taylor's first signs of life as he lay in a hospital bed . Miles apart: Mr Taylor's family were amazed when he moved his hand and tears streamed down his face as his fiancee spoke to him over the phone from the other side of the world . A coma is state in which a person is unaware of both self and external surroundings and unable to consciously feel, speak, hear, or move. Doctors monitor consciousness levels by assessing eye opening, verbal responses and voluntary movements. A higher score on the scale suggests that less brain function has been lost. The cause of a coma and age of the patient are important in determining whether they will recover. Some people remember events from when they were in a coma, while others do not. Most memories are likely to relate to the period when they were emerging from the coma. Some people recall feeling reassured by the presence of a loved one when coming out of a coma. A coma usually lasts for less than two to four weeks. It is unusual to remain in a coma for months or even years. Generally, the longer the person has been in a coma, the poorer the outlook. People do not usually suddenly 'wake up' from a coma, but regain brain function over time. Patients emerging from comas are often agitated and confused and may need to be sedated for their safety. In October, Mr Taylor was transferred . back to Britain, and his parents have kept a bedside vigil at Royal . Derby Hospital ever since. Miss Nurul managed to secure a visa so . she could join them at his bedside for three months, but after that she . was forced to return home to Bali, where she studies Dutch literature . at the University of Indonesia. Since the first phone call three weeks ago, Mr Taylor has slowly started to recover more movement in his body. ‘He’s really come on,’ said Mr Moore. ‘He is still in a low awareness coma but he moves his  hand left and . right when the phone rings. We are so pleased he is  recovering. We . spend most of our days at hospital and some days are good and others bad . but we take what we can get. ‘We are just happy he is responding. Yesterday Luke Griggs, spokesman for . brain injury charity Headway, said Mr Taylor could now make a full . recovery. He said: ‘Coma arousal programmes are often used to try to . stimulate patients who are in reduced states of consciousness, such as a . coma or a persistent vegetative state. ‘These carefully planned periods of . stimulation – in the form of sound, touch, smell and taste – are . combined with periods of complete rest in order not to overload the . person’s senses. ‘While each individual case is . different, in general terms the longer a person remains in a state of . reduced consciousness, the less likely they are to make a full recovery. ‘We have heard of several examples of . people waking from comas and going on to make good recoveries and live . happy, fulfilled lives. ‘Examples like this demonstrate that coma arousal programmes may well be effective.’ Miraculous: Doctors feared Mr Taylor would never regain consciousness after the crash in Bali . Overjoyed: Ms Nurul was forced to return to Bali after her visa ran out - but now she has hope that their wedding will finally take place .","Mathew Taylor, 31, has been unconscious since horrific motorbike crash .

"The company claims their product 'empowers women', but plenty of women disagree. The launch of a new 'vaginal tightening and rejuvenating cream' by an Indian pharmaceutical company has sparked fury among the fairer sex. Not only have women voiced the opinion on Twitter that 18 Again was created by Ultratech purely to cash in on female insecurities, but many are have criticised the accompanying TV advert. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . The advert for 18 Again involves a woman dancing seductively around her husband, repeatedly singing the line 'Ooh, I feel like a virgin' 18 Again promises to make a woman 'feel like a virgin' The awkward commercial, set in an extended family household, involves a woman dancing around the internal courtyard with her husband. She repeatedly sings lines borrowed and from Madonna's Like A Virgin (but given a Bollywood makeover),  including 'ooh, I feel . like a virgin' and 'it feels like the first time'. Her husband grabs her waist and warbles 'oh, yes it's true' while an elderly couple of parents look on, seemingly aghast. The film ends with a shot of the product, then a clip of the intrigued elderly couple apparently using the internet to order some of the cream for themselves.

The devastating condition is thought to . have afflicted Joseph Merrick, famously dubbed the Elephant Man, in the . late 19th century. Robert Smith, 24, has died at his home in Cambridgeshire, having suffered a massive heart attack despite his mother Rita's desperate attempts to save his life . Robert, who weighs 19 stone, has size 16 feet and a 40-inch inside leg, also has sight and hearing problems. To date, he has undergone a staggering 74 operations. He also suffers from gigantism, which means at 7 ft tall he is still growing, along with hydrocephalus (a build-up of fluid on the brain) and epilepsy. Since suffering from meningitis three years ago, when he was unconscious for seven weeks, he has been unable to walk. Family and friends from Walsoken, near Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, are now desperately fundraising to buy him a new £8,000 wheelchair - because he has grown out of his current one.

Proteus syndrome, thought to affect only a few hundred people worldwide, results in bone overgrowth. The word 'Proteus' comes from the name of the ancient Greek god of change. This overgrowth is usually asymmetrical, so corresponding body parts are not affected in the same way. Robert, for example, has 21 more bones in his hand than he should - and, as a result, suffers a great deal of pain. More men are affected than women and the cause is unknown. The syndrome became more widely known when it was determined that Joseph Merrick (the patient depicted in the play and film 'The Elephant Man') had severe Proteus syndrome rather than Neurofibromatosis, as had been suggested previously. Mrs Smith, who manages to look after her son despite . battling osteoporosis, arthritis, high cholesterol and high blood . pressure herself, added: 'A motorised wheelchair would totally transform our lives.' 'The longer Robert is forced to spend in the house, the more depressed he is becoming.' Robert added: 'I just want to go out . with my sister Marie Louise and visit Asda in Wisbech to buy some DVDs, . CDs and chocolate caramel sweets.' Robert was born a month prematurely . at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, King's Lynn, Norfolk, and it was . immediately clear he was unwell. 'He was born by Caesarean section and doctors said he would only live for a month,' said Mrs Smith. Robert was diagnosed with hydrocephalus and taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge. He started fitting as a baby and had eight shunts draining fluid from his brain by the time he was two. At the age of 10 he had a titanium plate inserted into his head, before being diagnosed with Proteus syndrome at 16. Robert's mother Rita, 66, his main carer, said: 'I can¿t believe he has gone.

"Secret Labour plans for a multi-billion-pound package of new ‘property wealth taxes’ to hammer London and the well-to-do counties of southern England were leaked last night. The Tories claim the proposals fly in the face of Ed Miliband’s claim to be a ‘one-nation’ leader and would only exacerbate the so-called ‘cost of living crisis’. Tellingly, the report commissioned by Mr Miliband which contains details of the ‘triple tax whammy’ is marked ‘very sensitive’. It would mean that if he wins power in next year’s General Election: . New taxes planned: Ed Miliband, left, and former Wickes DIY store boss Bill Grimsey, right . The tax plans are part of a report by Labour adviser and former Wickes DIY store boss Bill Grimsey, aimed at reviving struggling town centres. His blueprint would impose new levies on shop owners and businesses in the prosperous South of England – in addition to all farmers – to provide extra funds to run-down towns, mainly in the North. Mr Grimsey will discuss his recommendations later this month with Mr Miliband and Shadow Business Secretary Chuka Umunna, who recruited him to conduct the review. But the Conservatives last night claimed the plans would set North against South, lead to a rise in high street prices, including food, and hit rural areas. In addition, they said the proposals would mean a return to Labour’s failed high-tax policies of the 1970s. In his report, Strengthening The High Street, Mr Grimsey says that the current business rates system, which raises £23 billion a year, is ‘no longer fit for purpose’. He calls for a ‘better balance of the taxation burden among property and business owners’. In a candid, but strictly confidential, acknowledgement of the radical and controversial nature of his proposals, Mr Grimsey says Mr Miliband must ‘seize the initiative in this very sensitive area’  once he’s been elected Prime Minister – and sets out how he should do this. He says Mr Miliband must scrap the current rule under which all firms pay the same level of rates based on the value of the properties they occupy. Instead, a Labour government would immediately increase the level in prosperous areas (mainly the South) – and slash it in less prosperous areas (mainly the North) to tackle ‘geographical unfairness’. Even more provocatively, if it wins power in May 2015, Labour should take advantage of rarely-used, special ‘retrospective’ laws to backdate the change three months to March, says Mr Grimsey. Labour should ‘apply a regional factor to the rateable valuation of all business premises in March 2015 (retrospective to being elected) that addresses the geographical unfairness that has developed from the last (business rates) valuation,’ he explains. Decay: The plans aim to redistribute funds to run-down towns . And rural communities would be hit by a plan for Mr Miliband to ‘bring farmland and farm buildings back into the business rate system’ to subsidise firms in other areas. In another dramatic reform, Mr Grimsey says business rates, currently charged only on premises used for business purposes – for example, shops – should also be levied to the owners of such properties even if they have nothing to do with  the business. Mr Miliband must ‘consider levying a percentage of the tax on property owners and not just the occupying business,’ he  confirms. But Business Minister Matthew Hancock said: ‘Labour tried this flawed and divisive approach in the 1970s. It didn’t work then and it wouldn’t work now. It would increase rents, raise rates and cost residents. ‘Instead of penalising those who are doing well, Mr Miliband should focus on helping others learn from their success. Labour has no ideas other than taxing and spending more. ‘If shops and farms have to pay more tax, shopping bills will go up, making a nonsense of Mr Miliband’s talk about cutting the cost of living.’ The Tories also dismissed Mr Grimsey’s call on Mr Miliband to appoint a ‘Minister of High Streets’ as a gimmick. He also urges wide-ranging new tax-raising powers for Business Improvement Districts (BIDs), groups of local entrepreneurs set up by Labour in 2003 to boost city and town centres. Currently, BIDs, which operate in more than 100 towns, can charge firms only a modest levy.","Secret Labour documents plan to ramp up rates on farmers and the South .

Money would be redistributed to help run-down towns - mainly in the North .

"Russia is sending warships to Syria in an apparent show of strength in support of President Bashar al-Assad and his embattled regime. The move to defend Moscow’s interests in the strife-torn country came as a United Nations report revealed horrifying new details of children being tortured to death by Syrian government thugs. Soldiers have killed at least 256 children since Assad’s crackdown on anti-government protests began in March, according to the UN probe. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, centre left, visits a new military radar in the Kaliningrad region of Russia today. He is sending a warship to Syria in support of President Bashar al-Assad's regime . The report said that men and boys were sexually tortured at military jails and a two-year-old girl was shot dead just to prevent her from growing up to be a demonstrator. Last night, the disturbing claims piled more international pressure on Assad to end the bloodshed that is believed to have claimed 3,500 lives. But Russia’s flotilla of warships will give pause to Western leaders pushing for the kind of military intervention in Syria that ultimately drove Muammar Gaddafi from power in Libya. Russia, which has a major naval base in Syria and whose weapons trade with Damascus is worth millions of pounds a year, joined China last month to veto a Western-backed UN Security Council resolution condemning Assad’s government. Russia is planning to send its flagship aircraft carrier, the ‘Admiral Kuznetsov’ along with a patrol ship, an anti-submarine craft and other vessels towards its base on the Syrian coast near Tartus.

In Damascus, Syrian protesters display a giant portrait of President Bashar Assad during a pro-government rally yesterday . Officially, the Russian Navy said the mission had nothing to do with the uprising. But retired Russian Admiral Viktor Kravchenko said last night that Moscow was sending a message to the US and European leaders. ‘Having any military force apart from NATO is very beneficial for the region as it prevents the outbreak of armed conflict,’ he said. Shocking details of the report to the UN Human Rights Council showed that boys were subjected to sexual torture by their Syrian captors in front of adult men. ‘Torture was applied equally to adults and children,’ said the independent panel. ‘These crimes included murder, torture, rape and other forms of sexual violence,’ said the group’s chairman, Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, a Brazilian professor. ‘We have a very solid body of evidence,’ he added. Syrian security forces co-operating with militias were said to have been given ‘shoot to kill’ orders to quash protests. Injured people taken to military hospitals were beaten and tortured during interrogations carried out by government forces dressed up as doctors . On April 25, in Dara, dozens of conscripts who fired into the air rather than follow an order to shoot directly at people’s homes were themselves killed by security posed behind them, said the report. Arbitrary arrests and unlawful detentions were rife and many of those arrested were blindfolded and handcuffed and denied any food or medical help. Thousands more may have been abducted and disappeared. The commission said it based its report on interviews with more than 223 victims and witnesses including defectors from Syria’s military and security forces.","Children weren't spared torturers, claims independent panel .

"A 70-year-old security guard who risked his own life to stop a schoolwide stabbing spree earlier this year, saving the lives of countless students in the process, has been fired by the school district for being too old. John Resetar, who is employed by Capital Asset Protection Inc., a Pittsburgh-area company contracted to provide security to the Franklin Regional School District, got the shock of his life on August 4 when he found out his job was being terminated and his services were no longer needed this school year. Resetar got the news in a letter from Jeffrey Dahlke, Capital Asset's regional security operations manager, which read: 'Franklin Regional and Capital came to the conclusion that ... it is best ... to relieve you of your duties at the school.' Scroll down for video . John Resetar (pictured) was stabbed in the chest while holding down a teen on a schoolwide slashing spree . 'What really upset me, more than anything,' Resetar told KDKA, 'is that nobody would sit down and talk to me and tell me to my face. You know, I had to get a letter that was three weeks before school.' 'The way I was let go, I didn’t think it was fair, for what I did for the school.' Tim Dawson, Resetar's lawyer, says they plan to file a lawsuit. Despite what the letter states, the school district said Resetar's termination was unexpected. 'We had communication with the company and are trying to get more information, but it wasn't really in our realm of control,' said Mary Katherine Reljac, an assistant superintendent with the district. She said the school was surprised to be mentioned in the letter. Last April, Resetar became a national hero overnight when he helped to apprehend Alex Hribal at Franklin Regional High School after the teenage suspect allegedly stabbed 20 students with a pair of 8-inch kitchen knives. In the process, the unarmed guard was knifed in the chest. Alex Hribal, who allegedly stabbed 21 people, wrote a note boasting of his planned kill spree, investigators said . The entire attack unfolded in less than five minutes, as Hribal allegedly ran wildly down the school's hallway, slashing away with knives. 'He was stabbed on a Wednesday and he returned to work the following Monday, after having a stab wound an inch below his heart,' Resetar's lawyer Dawson said. 'He's a young 70, he was a linebacker and he can certainly still perform his job,' he added. Resetar worked in the school for nine years before he was told via certified mail that he was being dismissed. Now, the man who saved the lives of countless students, is unemployed. In June, Hribal, who is being tried as an adult, waived his right to a preliminary trial. His lawyer, Patrick Thomassey, plans to ask a judge to move the case to juvenile court, where Hribal would face incarceration or probation only until he's 21. Capital Asset Protection has yet to comment.","John Resetar stopped alleged stabber Alix Hribal after he had slashed 20 students at his high school .

"Police in Mexico's western state of Michoacan detained an alleged member of the Knights Templar cartel who is suspected of kidnapping children to harvest their organs, an official said on Monday. Michoacan state Public Safety Secretary Carlos Castellanos Becerra alleged that Manuel Plancarte Gaspar was part of the cartel's organ-trafficking ring. The ring would kidnap children and take them to rented homes with medical equipment where their organs were removed, Castellanos Becerra charged. The Knights Templar cartel in Mexico runs an organ-trafficking ring which has kidnapped young children . 'We have several statements in open investigations that point to a network of several suspects who would identify people with certain characteristics, especially children, and kidnap them,' he said. Castellanos Becerra said the cases go back several years, but he said he couldn't give any specific details or discuss evidence because the investigation is still open. Plancarte Gaspar, 34, was detained last week along with another suspect in a stolen car. The men were carrying cash and crystal meth, Castellanos Becerra said. He said Plancarte Gaspar is the nephew of Enrique Plancarte Solis, a top Knights Templar leader. Early in the day Castellanos Becerra sent an unusual Twitter message about the organ trafficking investigation. Mexican authorities don't normally make big announcements on Twitter. Children are taken from school and transported in refrigerated containers to have their organs removed and then sold . Plancarte Gaspar is the nephew of Enrique Plancarte Solis, pictured, a top Knights Templar leader . A leader of one of the local vigilante groups that sprang up last year in Michoacan to challenge the cartel's control told a radio station after hearing about the tweet that people in the area knew the Knights Templar gang was involved in organ trafficking because several children had been rescued in his town while being transported in a refrigerated container inside a van. 'They were inside a refrigerated box, tightly wrapped in blankets,' Dr. Jose Manuel Mireles, leader of the civilian 'self-defense' group in Tepalcatepec, said in a morning interview with MVS radio. Mireles said the van carrying the children was headed to the port city of Lazaro Cardenas and ended up in Tepalcatepec after making a wrong turn. 'They were all children from the same Mexico City school,' he said. He said the children's parents had allowed them to go on an outing to the beach when they were likely kidnapped. He said the children were turned over to their parents who traveled to Tepalcatepec. Mireles didn't say when the children were rescued and didn't answer his cellphone Monday. Mexican authorities have said drug trafficking is no longer the top source of income for the Knights Templar, which was once a top producer of crystal meth. The officials say the cartel's main sources of income are illegal mining, illegal logging and extortion.","Manuel Plancarte Gaspar, 34, is an alleged member of the Knights Templar cartel, who is suspected of kidnapping children for their organs .

"Capsule hotels are the norm in busy cities which attract a large number of tourists. Previously considered tiny, cramped and uncomfortable, they are now becoming, smarter, slicker and sexier as more and more travellers seek unique experiences at wallet-friendly prices.

Sleeping tubes are currently only used in the workplace but Podtime  has launched their hotel business, Podtels . ‘We are trying to launch the hotel in Gatwick Airport,’ co-founder Paul Grindrod told MailOnline Travel. ‘We already have a hotel in Moscow and we’re hoping to launch more hotels all over the world.' Capsule hotels were first developed in Japan and feature a number of very small rooms. Designed to provide inexpensive overnight accommodation, they are usually located near train stations and provide overnight accommodation for business people or commuters who have missed their last train home. Podtime’s sleeping tubes have currently only been used in the workplace with companies like Facebook and Nestle investing in the nap cylinder. There is also a hostel in North America which features the company’s new double bunk pods. Small but perfectly formed: The pods will be able to be stacked into two levels, which will form a hotel complex . The pods will have space for luggage and there will be optional extras like TVs, lighting and power sockets . The pods are the brainchild of Jon Gray, who created them as a recharge hub for busy city executives.The business was launched in 2011. Podtels will see the sleep pods – which are based on the current pods but able to take a double bed - being stacked into two levels, which will form a hotel complex. Podtel rooms, which measure 1.5m, will also have space for luggage and there will be optional extras like TVs, lighting and power sockets. ‘We would love to have one in London but as yet there aren’t enough funds as we are a small company,’ Mr Grindrod said.","Sleeping tubes are commonly used as rest hub for busy executives .

And after discovering an online community of men who appreciate curvy women, Sarah says she has no shortage of admirers. She explained: 'It began when I took pictures of myself to document my weight loss and a photographer friend put them on Facebook. 'They got so many likes that he asked if we could do some modelling pictures, then those pictures went viral.' But while she is comfortable with her dimensions, filling her wardrobe is expensive and requires serious planning. 'Because of my size I can't ever find outfits in normal stores. My top half is a 7XL and my bottom half is 10XL so I have to go to specialists. 'I buy most of my clothes online because there are few plus-size stores with big enough clothes. Larger outfits are expensive so I can spend up to £400 per month on clothes.' And her problems don't end with finding clothes. Thanks to her ample bottom, she finds it difficult to perform even the most basic chores. Tight fit: Along with doors, Sarah confesses to having problems doing up her seat belt because of her rear . Weighty business: Sarah's bottom is so large, she once cracked a theatre toilet bowl just by sitting on it . Inspiration: Sarah says she hopes to inspire other large ladies to love themselves a little more . 'With most doorways I have to go in sideways - I do the little wiggle dance to get through,' she explained. 'I've broken chairs before and I once broke a toilet bowl I was sat on at the theatre - it was awful.' However, now Sarah is taking steps to tackle her mobility issues with workout sessions to help her lose weight. 'Although I love my butt I would like to make it just a little bit smaller,' she confessed. 'The size that it is causes back problems- even sitting down on a chai can be painful.' And although Sarah says large posteriors run in the family, she admits that her unhealthy junk food diet doesn't help. 'Apart from my younger sister, the women in my family all have large behinds - I only eat between 1,500 and 2,000 calories per day. 'However do have a problem with portion control and I sometimes get tempted by ice cream - that's my weakness.' Growing up Ms Massey says she was constantly teased because if her developing behind - and was only chatted up by older men. 'Guys my age weren't interested in me - they liked my skinnier friends. Old guys would hit on me because they appreciated my body. 'Because of that I always ended up in relationships with guys 10, sometimes 20 years older.' Despite the negative comments and difficulties fitting through the door and into regular clothes, Sarah says she has no regrets and hopes to inspire other women. 'I'm trying to make the most of what I've been given and being confident about who I am makes me happy,' added Ms Massey. 'If I can inspire others to embrace their curves and be proud big, beautiful women, I would be very happy.'","Sarah Massey, 33, from Chicago, has a bottom that measures 7ft around .

"Looking up into the night sky, a stunned photographer realised he had seen something special when he captured these amazing pictures. What perhaps looks like a multi-coloured flying saucer is in fact a rare weather phenomenon known as a 'fire rainbow cloud'. The series of photographs were taken by Ken Rotberg as the cloud hovered over south Florida, America. Mr Rotberg had just returned home from a game of tennis when he saw the odd sight as the sun dropped behind a storm cloud near Delray Beach in the early evening. Burning bright: The rare phenomenon appeared behind a storm cloud near Delray Beach, Florida . The 49-year-old said: 'I grabbed my camera and headed out. It didn't take long for the small 'blob' of a cloud to take on some colour. 'Then the saucers appeared. I got a little excited. Then it turns out to be something just amazing. 'I was just amazed at what I was witnessing, watching it slowly change. I'm shooting this truly rare and amazing sight, shot after shot and I realise there is nobody else around me.' Mr Rotberg, a director at a jewellery services catalogue company, added: 'I wanted to say 'Hey look up there! Check that out!' But there was just me. 'At least when I tell the story, people will believe me because I have so many pictures.' Atmospheric optics expert Dr Les Cowley said 'fire rainbow cloud' was not the best way to describe the phenomenon, which is also known by its proper name of circumhorizon arc. He said: 'To be blunt, it is a very silly and misleading name. The arc is not a rainbow and has nothing to do with fire. 'What is happening here is that on sunny afternoons, cumulus clouds boil upwards, pushing layers of moist air above them even higher where they cool and condense to form cloud caps or 'pileus' (Latin for cap). 'When pileus clouds form very quickly, their water droplets tend to be all the same size, the perfect condition for irridescent colours.' Saucers in the sky: Ken Rotberg looked up and saw the colours change before his eyes until they turned into these saucer-like shapes .

"An extreme sportsman has made a heart-warming photo diary charting his agonising decision to have his left foot amputated. Joseph Pleban, 23, was told he had a rare bone and joint disease which caused recurring tumours in his ankle. He decided to have his left foot removed by surgeons after realising it would allow him to continue to pursue extreme sports. Undaunted: Joseph Pleban, left, was told that a rare joint disease meant he could no longer pursue extreme sports - so he chose to have it amputated, and even asked for a joking 'please cut here' tattoo on his leg . Post-op: Mr Pleban has now had the operation, and included pictures of his leg after the amputation, above. He plans to have a prosthetic limb fitted so that he can continue with his extreme sports . Sense of humour: Mr Pleban assembled a photo-diary of his last adventures with his leg still intact - including posing for pictures suggesting other ways he could lose the limb . As he was growing up Mr Pleban, from Fredericksburg, Virginia, kept hurting his left ankle while snowboarding, wakeboarding and playing rugby. After consulting doctors, Mr Pleban eventually decided the only option was to have the lower section of his left leg amputated. He created a unique photo as a farewell to his foot after choosing to replace his damaged ankle with a blade-style prosthetic. He said: 'Over six years I had to give up all of the sports I loved. Although taking my ankle away was a big sacrifice, the change to regain the ability to play those sports again meant it it was a no-brainer. Alternative surgery: Mr Pleban, posing above with his girlfriend Johnna Hentrick, 30, took his forthcoming operation in extremely good humour . 'Please cut here': Shortly before his operation, Mr Pleban asked for the tongue-in-cheek tattoo, which he sent to his surgeon . Jokes: Mr Pleban's leg can be seen above at the tattoo parlour having the amusing design drawn on . 'It took me a little while to get past the emotional hurdles. As a way to come to terms with what was happening I decided to capture the journey in pictures.' The photo series follows Mr Pleban from the moment he chose to have his ankle amputated, through the surgery itself, up to the mirror therapy which he is currently undertaking to adjust to life as an amputee. Mr Pleban broke his ankle while wakeboarding the day after he graduated from college in 2008. Doctors operated on the ankle and found that the area was full of small tumours. It was discovered that he had a rare condition called pigmented villonodular synovitis, which produces malignant non-cancerous tumours which attack cartilage, causing agonising degenerative arthritis. Extreme: Mr Pleban, pictured here performing a headstand whilst snowboarding, drew up a bucket list of extreme sports to get done before losing the ankle . Taking the plunge: Mr Pleban, who has always been a sports enthusiast, could have tried other surgery, but decided to push on with amputation as it would provide a definite solution . Big leap: Mr Pleban and Miss Hentrick are shown above in a plane from which they are about to skydive . An operation to remove the tumours was carried out but within six months they had grown back. In 2010 Mr Pleban underwent a second round of surgery followed by radiation therapy and was told he would no longer be able to pursue sports. He said: 'I was a competition swimmer for 18 years then played rugby through college. Later I picked up American football, soccer and snowboarding.' 'Any sport - you name it, I'd play it. To be told that I wouldn't be able to play sports was the worst thing I had ever heard.' In March 2014 he had an MRI which revealed that the nodules had once again returned. Doctors advised that the only option was to fuse his ankle and have surgeries for the rest of his life. Despite their advice to undergo the fusion treatment, Mr Pleban decided to go for amputation instead as it would allow him to continue playing sport. Out and about: Mr Pleban, pictured riding a wheelchair in hospital, says he is looking forward to incorporating his new leg into Hallowe'en costumes . Heartwarming: Mr Pleban documented the three months of his life before the amputation, and included the first stages of his recovery from the procedure . Mr Pleban said: 'It came down to either going through surgeries for a good portion of my life or have one surgery to end them all and be as active as I want on a prosthetic. 'My dad was the last one to accept my choice. He was searching everywhere for other options, but I just had to tell him that it was time to let it go. 'Nothing was going to work except fusion or amputation, and I had decided on amputation.' Mr Pleban and his girlfriend Johnna Hetrick, 30, decided to create a photo record, beginning three months before he had surgery. He said: 'We drew up a list of things which we wanted to do while I could. It was heartbreaking to lose it, but that wasn't going to stop me doing things before I lost it.' Before and after: Mr Pleban poses left at a swimming pool before the operation, and right walking through hospital with crutches, wearing a bizarre beard disguise . Activities included go-karting, paintballing, watersliding and skydiving. The couple went on vacation to the Caribbean and went scuba diving and parasailing. In an expression of Mr Pleban's bravery and sense of humour, he uploaded pictures with electric saws and paintball guns, offering them up as alternative ways to remove his leg. Just before the operation he asked for a tattoo of a line on his ankle with the words 'please cut here'. He said: 'I sent a picture of my tattoo in an email to the surgeon while he was at a conference in London. He showed the photos around and it became a big hit. 'Right before the surgery, I freaked out a bit. I realised there would be no way to turn back from my decision once I'd had the surgery. 'But as soon as I woke up from the surgery and looked down, I knew I had done the right thing . 'I start getting fitted for a new leg as soon as the sutures are out.' He is already planning Hallowe'en costume ideas with his girlfriend. He said: 'I could be a surfer and she could be a shark - maybe we could add a surfboard with a shark bite out of it. 'I would like to get a leg with a USB port that converts the kinetic energy from me walking into electrical energy to charge my phone.' Miss Hetrick said: 'He is an inspiration to me. Him losing part of his leg wouldn't change my feelings for him at all. 'I let him make the decision which was right for him and I support him entirely.'","Joseph Pleban, 23, loves adventure, but was struck with rare ankle disease .

"Robyn Gardner was buried alive in a dog’s grave dug up by her lover who taped a plastic bag over her head, the National Enquirer claims. The allegation is the latest sensational development in the story of the Maryland woman, 35, who vanished two months ago while on holiday with Gary Giordano in Aruba. Authorities have been searching for her since August and Giordano, 50, is currently being held in jail as they suspect he was involved in her death. Missing: Robyn Gardner, left, 35, of Maryland, vanished two months ago while on holiday in Aruba with Gary Giordano, 50, right, who she reportedly met online . Police were given a tip by a man who claimed Giordano put a bag over her head and tied up her limbs with duct tape, reported the National Enquirer. He allegedly then drove to Dog Graves Beach on the Caribbean island and dug up a dog’s grave with his bare hands, a source told the magazine. ‘He dug up a fresh dog’s grave with his hands, removed the dog’s body, widened the hole and put Robyn in it,’ they told the National Enquirer. The source alleged Giordano then put the dead dog’s body on top of hers and then she started moaning and moving while he filled up the hole. Presumed dead: Miss Gardner, pictured here in one of her last photos . Earlier this month a team of cadaver dogs from the Netherlands arrived in southeast Aruba to search for her remains of Miss Gardner.

"The once disgraced Duchess of York has flown to Balmoral to spend the weekend with the Queen, it has today been revealed. Sarah Ferguson, former wife of Prince Andrew, reportedly flew to Aberdeen on Friday shortly after daughter Beatrice's birthday celebrations in Windsor. While she has visited Balmoral since her divorce, it is thought to be the first time she has been invited to stay in the main castle on the Queen's estate since her marriage ended in 1996. Royal ride: Fergie was driven to the airport by her former husband Prince Andrew while her daughters Beatrice and Eugenie travelled in the back seat ahead of a family visit to Balmoral . Fergie was joined by Andrew, and daughters Beatrice and Eugenie on the trip, the Sunday Express reports. A Balmoral source told the paper it was 'just like old times'. They added: 'The Duchess is being treated as if she and the Duke were still married.' The Queen has long been said to have remained fond of her former daughter-in-law. But Prince Philip is said to be baffled by Fergie and Prince Andrew's relationship. The couple, who still live together, separated in 1992 but remained on good terms and brought up their daughters together.

He is expected to travel to Edinburgh to carry out his first public engagement since the procedure, and will the join the Queen in Balmoral, where she has been staying since last Thursday. It has been claimed that Prince Philip has never forgiven the Duchess for the embarrassment she caused the Royal Family during the 90s - during which time she embarked on an affair with a Texan oil tycoon while pregnant with her second child and was photographed ­having her toes sucked by  her 'financial adviser'.

"A teenager has been killed and two of his friends seriously wounded after two men broke into their home, lined them up and shot them in their heads execution style, their family said. The death of Alex Zaldivar, 19, and injuries to Remington Campos, 23, and his sister Brienna Campos, 20, came just one day before they were to testify against two men in an earlier invasion. The families of the victims believe one of the two suspects accused of the first break-in, Bessman Charles Obinna Okafor, returned to the home to kill the witnesses while he was out on bond. Murdered: Alex Zaldivar, 19, was fatally shot in the head by home invaders. At least two men broke into his house on September 10 and lined up him and two friends and shot them, execution style . 'Miraculous': Siblings Remington Campos, left, and Brienna Campos, right, were also shot in the head during the home invasion but survived. They stumbled to a neighbour's home for help . 'They were trying to execute them all because they were going to testify the very next day,' Zaldivar's father, Rafael, told the Orlando Sentinel. 'They came here and executed him like a dog. The friends' home in Ocoee, Florida was targeted for the second time on September 10 at 5.15 a.m. Police believe two or three suspects kicked down the locked front door and started pulling the friends from their beds and lining them up in the living room. Brienna, whose room was nearest the front door, was scrambling to put on clothes when the intruders dragged her out and put her face-down on the floor. Her brother Remington was pulled from . his bed, pistol-whipped and pushed next to his sister, he told his . parents. Alex was then forced alongside them. Fearing his life was about to end, Alex grabbed the hands of his two friends and told . them he loved them - before the suspects kicked apart their hands and . started shooting, the parents said. Scene: It was the second home invasion at the friends' Ocoee home, pictured. Their family believes one of the men from an earlier break-in returned to the house to kill the witnesses . Brienna was shot first but remained conscious, sparking one of the men to ask: 'Did you miss?' She played dead and listened as her brother and friend were shot, her father said. They fired at Alex multiple times, including at least once in the back of the head. Remington was shot once in the head, but also miraculously survived. The men left and after Brienna failed . to find a phone, she stumbled with her brother through the back door . and over a fence to a neighbour's house, leaving a trail of blood behind . them. The . Campos siblings survived and are now in hiding. They are certain their . attackers were the also behind the May invasion, but police have not yet . made any arrests in the latest case. Did they do it? Bessman Okafor, left, was out on bond following the May break-in and his electronic tag shows he was not at home during the second break in. Nolan Bernard, right, was also charged in May . The two men, Okafor and Nolan Darnell Bernard, were scheduled to stand trial on September 11, the day after the shooting, and Alex and Brienna were listed as possible witnesses. One suspect, 27-year-old Okafor was out on bond with a tag. He left his home at 4.40 a.m. the morning of the shootings and returned at 5:46 a.m., court records reveal. He was arrested for violating the terms of his release but has not been charged in the shootings. The . parents of the victims returned to the home on Monday to sweep up their . children's dry blood and tell their version of events. 'It's a miracle my children survived, ' Alfonso Campos, who owns the home, said. Alex, . who was studying business at a nearby community college, was buried in . Gotha on Saturday. He leaves behind his parents and big brother, Raf. Terrifying: Alex, left, had reached over for the hand of Brienna, right, and her brother to tell them he loved them before he was shot dead in his living room. The siblings are now in hiding . Loss: The families said they would fight for justice for Alex, left, who was buried last week, right . Alfonso Compos said his children will now fight to put their friend's killers behind bars. 'They will not be afraid to keep on going and bring justice,' he said. 'We don't want his death to be in vain,' Rafael Zaldivar added. 'They executed him like a dog. They were cowards, . complete cowards.' Friends and family are now rallying for Alex's voice to be heard, setting up community groups calling for justice and signing petitions to make breaking out on bond harder for suspects. On a Facebook group, they write that Okafor has a history of violence and crime - 17 criminal charges since he was 16. 'How could [the judge] let such a violent criminal with a record like this go with a soft slap on the wrist?' they write. 'None of this would have happened if Okafor were still in prison where he clearly belongs.'","Men broke into Florida home on September 10 - a day before the friends were to appear in court to testify in case for earlier home invasion .

"As president and CEO of Yahoo! Marissa Mayer is one of the most powerful businesswomen in the . country but unfortunately that doesn’t mean that she's immune to having sexist remarks said to her in public. Mayer was on a panel at the company's annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday, her first since joining last year, when the moderator asked for questions from the audience. One . investor chose to inform the entire audience that he was less . interested in what Mayer had to say about innovation and was more . interested in her appearance. Scroll down for video . Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer was on the panel of her first annual shareholder meeting when a man told the entire room that he found her attractive . ‘This . is my personal opinion. First is I'm George Polis, I have 2,000 shares . in Yahoo!, I'm Greek and I'm a dirty old man and you look attractive . Marissa,’ said the shareholder who then went on to complain about the . lack of dividend the company had paid out in recent years. Mayer . refused to rise to the old fool’s bait and another Yahoo! executive . proceeded to respond to his second question about dividends, while there . was embarrassed laughter from the event’s moderator. Mayer took over the £16 billion company last July and quickly made headlines when she decided to ban telecommuting and then had a nursery built next to her office for her baby daughter. Earlier this year she featured in Makers, a PBS/AOL documentary about the 'women who make America.' In it Mayer said she doesn't consider herself a feminist . and that she believes feminism has become a 'more negative word.' Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer sparked controversy over her decision to kill the company's popular work-from-home policy . In the film Mayer says: 'I don’t think that I would consider myself a feminist. I think that, I certainly believe in equal rights. I believe that women are just as capable, if not more so, in a lot of different dimensions. 'But I don’t, I think, have sort of the militant drive and sort of the chip on the shoulder that sometimes comes with that. And I think it’s too bad, but I do think feminism has become, in many ways, a more negative word. 'There are amazing opportunities all over the world for women, and I think that there’s more good that comes out of positive energy around that than negative energy,' says Mayer. As Business Insider points out, women still earn less than men at every level of education, and women hold just 17 percent of senior management roles in the U.S. Mayer banned working from home after she noted that workers had not been logging on enough. Career move: On July 16, 2012, Mayer was appointed President and CEO of Yahoo, which is headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, near San Jose . Girl next door: Mayer exudes glamor and . sophistication, pictured left with husband Zachary Bogue at a 2011 . event.  She welcomed her first child in September 2012, only months after joining Yahoo! Mayer's . decision sparked an outcry from working mothers and other companies in . Silicon Valley who blasted the hypocrisy of her banning the action but . allowing herself an in-office space for her child. The company headquarters is located in Sunnyvale, California, near San Jose. The public corporation employs 11,500 people in more than 20 countries across the globe. Mayer, a 37-year-old Silicon Valley whiz kid who was previously a big deal at Google before switching to the competition, was appointed the head of Yahoo in July 2012. She instituted free lunches at the company headquarters and started giving out smartphones to employees. 'I want Yahoo to be the absolute best place to work, to have a fantastic culture. We're working really hard right now to remind people about all the opportunities that are there,' she said shortly after she was hired at a Fortune magazine event in November.","Meyer was attending her first annual shareholder meeting since taking over last July .

"Charlie Grieves-Cook died after falling 40ft onto a concrete car park . He clung to metal rail for 10 minutes while intruders fired shots in apartment . Kenyan police investigating whether a spurned lover was involved in his death . Claims Grieves-Cook was initially refused treatment at a Nairobi hospital with staff demanding cash before he was admitted . The model girlfriend of a British ex-public schoolboy killed after trying to escape armed thugs in Kenya has spoken of the terrifying moments before he plunged to his death from a third-floor balcony. Diana Nekoye Sifuna, 24, told how she was forced to wrestle gunmen who called at her home and demanded to see her photographer lover Charlie Grieves-Cook. Fleeing via a back room, Mr Grieves-Cook, 36, desperately clung on to the balcony’s metal rail, dangling perilously 40ft above ground for 10 minutes, while the intruders fired shots into the apartment. In the first full account of the bungled raid, Miss Sifuna described in dramatic detail how she screamed at her lover to run as she fought for her life. Lovers: Diana Sifuna and Charlie Grieves-Cook. Mr Grieves-Cook fell to his death from a balcony after two intruders forced their way into her apartment . The striking model, who is renowned in her home country as a former Face of Africa beauty contestant, told how the couple were watching a film on the evening of March 3 when the doorbell rang at her apartment close to the Kibera township, one of Kenya’s largest slums. Thinking it was a rubbish collector, she fetched the equivalent of £3 to give as a tip before opening the door to find two youths wearing tracksuits, one of whom demanded to see ‘the mazungu, the white man’. She said: ‘I asked him to give the name of the white man, but he was unable to say. When I told him he was at the wrong house, I saw him removing a small gun from his waist and he pointed it towards me. Rundown: A bullet hole, seen on the right, is clearly visible next to the door of Miss Sifuna’s apartment in the Desert Rose complex, from which Mr Grieves-Cook fell to his death . ‘I thought it was a toy pistol, so I . grabbed it. I struggled with him while I was still holding the gun, but . it went off. I was holding it and at the same time screaming, telling . Charlie to run away. ‘The . neighbours started locking their houses. I pushed him outside, where I . kept on struggling with him, trying to wrestle the gun from him, and it . fired again. Terrifying ordeal: Model Diana Sifuna's police statement . ‘When the . gun fired, I released my hand from the gun and went to the next door at . a corner. I tried banging my neighbour’s door but nobody opened the . door for me. ‘The boy . started running while still firing at me. I heard another gunshot . downstairs, which I later learned hit the watchman of our apartment on . his hand. ‘When they . had gone, I entered my house and heard Charlie calling me. I found him . hanging, having gripped the sides of the balcony.’ In a police statement, which has been shown to The Mail on Sunday, Miss Sifuna told how Mr Grieves-Cook tragically lost his grip and fell on to a concrete ledge before she could fetch a rope to pull him to safety. She said: ‘When I held his hand and tried to pull him up, he advised me to go to the house to get a rope. I went but when I got back I saw him falling down.’ Police yesterday confirmed they had retrieved used gun cartridges, and were carrying out forensic tests on them and on the doorbell. Diana Nekoye Sifuna was forced to wrestle gunmen . There was no doctor on duty at the local medical centre, so Miss Sifuna had to take Mr Grieves-Cook to another hospital. They were then refused treatment until one of his friends paid over the phone by credit card so that he could be taken to the intensive-care unit. He later died of his injuries. The detailed account comes after detectives in Nairobi said they believe Mr Grieves-Cook may have been targeted by a jealous love rival. Officers are now planning to question Miss Sifuna about any male friends who may have hired hitmen to kill her lover. They are trying to piece together the events that brought Mr Grieves-Cook, who comes from one of Kenya’s most prominent white families, to the notoriously crime-ridden area of the capital city where he met his death. Nothing was stolen from Miss Sifuna’s home, leading police to question why the thugs targeted the apartment. Police commander David Rono Bonei said yesterday: ‘We believe this lady may have had two or three other boyfriends. Men get very jealous. It is only human. ‘Miss Sifuna has a lot more questions to answer. She has been very traumatised and upset, but now it is time to tell us a lot more about her love life.’ Mr Grieves-Cook was born and raised in Kenya before being educated at the £30,000-a-year Hurstpierpoint College, a prominent boarding school in West Sussex. After leaving school, he trained as a chef and worked at some of London’s Michelin-starred restaurants. He returned to Kenya in 1998 and built a . successful career in photography. Mr Grieves-Cook met Miss Sifuna a . year ago during a photo shoot. Despite owning his own home in the . affluent suburb of Lavington, he was a regular visitor to her apartment . in a rundown area of Langata. Around one million people live in . dilapidated shacks made of plastic sheeting and corrugated iron in . nearby Kibera, many of them sleeping on dirt floors. One . hole-in-the-ground latrine services 50 shacks and the open sewers lead . to epidemics of cholera and enteritis. Unemployment stands at 50 per cent, there is widespread dependence on the often-lethal home-brewed chang’aa liquor, and social deprivation is rife. Rape and murder rates are high. Police reluctance to enter Kibera has led to protection rackets that rule the slums. Senior detective James Manuni said: ‘Diana Nekoye Sifuna is one of the biggest names in the fashion media and she could afford to live somewhere safer. Charlie Grieves-Cook was playing with fire by going to that part of Langata at night, so close to Kibera.’ He said police inquiries showed that other male friends were regular visitors to the Desert Rose apartments and that Mr Grieves-Cook may have become a target. Four hundred mourners attended a memorial service at Nairobi’s Muthaiga Country Club on Friday, following a funeral service and cremation for family members only. Charlie’s father Jake, former chairman of Kenya’s Tourist Board and managing director of Gamewatchers Safaris, said he believed the thugs may have followed his son to Miss Sifuna’s apartment, but he would await the findings of the inquiry. He said: ‘In the meantime, we do not wish to speculate on their motives other than the probability that it was a bungled robbery attempt which had tragic circumstances. ‘We are all devastated at the loss of my son and it is heart-breaking for his family and friends. Charlie was an extraordinary young man with enormous talent who was loved by all who knew him.’","Charlie Grieves-Cook died after falling 40ft onto a concrete car park .

"Marnie the dog was once known as 'Stinky,' and lived a harsh life on the streets of Connecticut. But her life changed dramatically for the better when the lovable dog was adopted. So much for the better, in fact, that the Shih-Tzu is now one of the most popular dogs on Instagram and and has more than 134,000 followers. Marnie also has notable Instagram photos with 'friends' such as actor Jonah Hill and pop star Miley Cyrus - Not bad for a dog who once had 14 decaying teeth removed and was diagnosed as being blind in one eye. Owner Shirley Braha has wrote a biography of Marnie's life on social networking website Tumblr and it makes for an interesting read. Marnie was found by Animal Control in August 2012 on the streets of Connecticut with matted and smelly fur. The scruffy looking Shih-Tzu  was  moved to a shelter and named Stinky, before being adopted as a result of a petfinder.com post. Second chance: Marnie is grateful for her new life in New York where she is well cared for . Content: Marnie is very popular with Instagram followers and her unusual look seems to intrigue people . Stinky took a train with her new adopted owner Ms Braha down to her new home in New York City and she stunk out the entire train. She was later renamed as Marnie after musician Marnie Stern and shortly afterwards she had 14 decaying teeth removed and started smelling much nicer. Marnie's left eye was so gray and cloudy that her new owner was told she would never see again from that eye. Long tongue: Marnie's owner Shirley Braha says her long tongue is just an unusual feature of her appearance . Shopping: Marnie looks up at the camera (left)  and (right) she looks attentively at something in the store . On her Tumblr page about Marnie's owner Ms Braha, an MTV producer and director says the dog's long tongue is often a source of bemusement and intrigue. She writes: 'The reality is Marnie just has a long tongue, and has always had a long tongue, and its awesome, and she licks it every few minutes to keep it from getting too dry, and when it's snowing she puts her tongue back in.' Another unique physical feature Marnie has is a head tilt which a senior veterinarian said was not a major concern and may have occurred as a result of a previous brief illness called Vestibular Syndrome. Ms Braha says despite her difficult start in life once Marnie became more comfortable in her new home and gained confidence, her personality began to shine through. Lets go: Marnie stands patiently at the end of a shopping aisle as she waits for her owner . Obstacles: Marnie avoids the passing people during her visit to the shopping store . Thankfully soon after she was adopted Marnie's left eye began to improve and she is now able to see again. The 12 year-old dog's favourite things are long walks, exploring, sleeping, chicken, broccoli, Greek yogurt, watermelon eggs and parties. Her owner says the only thing Marnie dislikes is being left alone as she becomes anxious. Apart from an occasional bout of anxiousness Marnie is very happy and grateful dog. Ms Braha says: 'Senior rescue dogs are known for being especially grateful and loyal to their new owners for giving them a second chance on life, and Marnie lives every day exemplifying this joy and gratitude.'","Dog's remarkable life reads like a Hollywood rags to riches story .

"Scientists have discovered a link between cataracts and Alzheimer’s that they hope will pave the way for new treatments for the brain disease. The link could also mean a simple eye test might provide an early indicator that someone has Alzheimer's, according to a study. The finding, by researchers at Boston University Schools of Medicine, indicates that dementia might originate outside of the brain and be connected to the body as a whole. Opticians: A link between cataracts and Alzheimer's could mean a simple eye test might provide an early indicator that someone has the brain disease . A growing amount of evidence suggests cataracts and Alzheimer's - both associated with increasing age - may share common factors. The discovery means diagnosing Alzheimer’s could be done earlier and suggests new treatment targets for the debilitating disease. Scientists say there is a significant relationship between cortical cataracts - the most common form of the eye disease - and brain degeneration related to Alzheimer’s. After looking at brain MRI findings a decade after an original eye exam, researchers found another link between cortical cataract formation and poorer results on cognitive tests given to patients. They then performed a genome-wide association study on nearly 190,000 DNA sequence variations, focusing on a protein called delta-catenin. The protein has previously been implicated in brain and eye development, but not directly in either cataracts or Alzheimer’s. After further tests however, the researchers discovered an increase in another protein that aggregates in Alzheimer brains and is thought to be central to the development of the disease. The study also revealed increased deposits of delta-catenin in lens tissue of autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer’s cases. Professor Lindsay Farrer, of Boston University Schools of Medicine, said: 'Though much work remains to be done, a link between cataracts and Alzheimer’s disease supports the idea of a systemic rather than brain-limited focus for processes leading to Alzheimer’s disease. 'This study gives hope that we are moving toward earlier diagnosis and new treatment targets for this debilitating disease.' The research is published in the online journal PLoS ONE.","Link could lead to new treatments for Alzheimer's .

"Just days after staff at a Florida Dunkin' Donuts were berated by a disgustingly rude customer, a man has been caught on tape delivering a vicious spray of abuse to a poor Wendy's drive-thru cashier because someone put cheese in his hamburger. The footage shows the belligerent customer banging the ledge outside a drive-thru window aggressively with his fist as he yells at the attendant, who, while not visible in the video, is sure to be a third of his age. 'I need my money back and I want it fast,' the angry man screams. 'Is there cheese in hamburger? There is no cheese in hamburger. When you have a cheeseburger you have a cheeseburger, when you have hamburger you have a hamburger.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Rude: The vile customer, pictured, is caught on tape abusing Wendy's staff over his wrong order . The shocking confrontation was filmed and posted on YouTube by Jacob Donnelly, who appears to be sitting in a car behind the indignant customer. 'I want my money back, I want it back now and I want it fast,' the vile man continues, getting increasingly worked up at the cashier who almost certainly didn't make his meal. 'There's not even bacon on this, or onion on this, there's not anything that I asked for. This is such incompetence and it happens every time I come here.' When the worker appears to try to calm him down, the man barks, again banging his fists in a threatening manner: 'I am losing my s*** because this happened the past three times I've come. Please be competent for once in your life. Once. Take an order and fill it.' He is then given back his money, as requested, and the attendant quickly shuts the window, probably fearing a punch in the face. But even then the customer is not content. '... damn it, I paid more than this, I want ten bucks you G** damn sons of b****es, G** damn sons of b****es,' he yells before storming off into the night. Threatening: The poor cashier, who is probably a teenager and almost certainly didn't make the man's meal, is dished a vicious spray of abuse . Wendy's: The incident occurred at a Wendy's, thought it's unclear where it was located . Donnelly praised the poor Wendy's staff in a comment underneath the video, which has garnered more than 55,000 views since it was uploaded on June 13. 'Props to the hard working folks at Wendy's for showing restraint when this whack job loses his mind over a wrong order,' he said. The disgusting behavior comes hot on the heels of 27-year-old Taylor Chapman's disgraceful tirade. The Broward County woman filmed herself abusing Dunkin' Donuts employees in an apparent attempt to exact some kind of consumer justice. Chapman, however, only succeeds in appearing rude, ignorant and racist in the video, which she posted on her Facebook page. The imagined slight occurred the night prior, when a Dunkin' Donuts employee apparently forgot to print Chapman's receipt. In what Chapman seems to have construed as a mortal insult, the employee offered Chapman her entire order free the next time she entered the store to make up for the oversight. Hamburger: The customer is right, there is no cheese in Wendy's hamburger, pictured . Cheeseburger: But there is cheese in the restaurant's cheeseburger, pictured . This more than generous offer . apparently boiled Chapman's blood, and she entered the fast food outlet . the next day armed with a camera phone and a bad attitude. To the credit of Dunkin' Donuts . staff, they are unfailingly polite to Chapman, despite the insults, . swearing and racial slurs spat at them.

The . eight minute and nine second ordeal begins with Chapman warning the . male employee who serves her, 'This is all being under video . surveillance, OK?' She then . tells him her complaint: That a female employee the night before forgot . to print out her receipt and then 'turned into a complete rude b*tch'. She . neglects to explain exactly how the employee did her wrong though. 'She . told me, OK, you can get your order free next time. So you know what I . told her? I want the whole f****n' menu, b***h. Twice.' Poor worker: The Dunkin' Donuts employee, right, gracefully puts up with  demands and insults from Chapman, left . According to Chapman, her lawyer is . 'already on it' and she says she'd spoken to someone from the store . earlier that day who told her she could have her order free. The . employee explains that he doesn't know what happened the night before . but reassures Chapman he's happy to give her what she wants. She begins to order, asking for the Strawberry Coolatta, which she admits was not one of the items she ordered the day before. Chapman tells a fellow customer, 'I just want my bacon crispy and my people nice, you know?' 'Cos . I literally thought this was the best one in the city, and I gave you . guys so many good, like, remarks online because I have a business degree . and, like, I really did until that b***h just completely p****d me . off,' she explains, reasonably. Chapman attempts to engage her fellow customers in the video, but they aren't forthcoming. 'That's . your issue,' says one man. 'I've got my own issues.' A receipt ain't . one, though, as he tells Chapman that he is always given his receipt at . Dunkin' Donuts. 'I'm from Indiana in Kentucky,' Chapman tells the man, 'And up there this s**t doesn't happen,' she . says, but goes on to mention that 'One time they p*ssed in my fries . where I'm from at home. Literally I could smell the p*ss.' Viral: Before making her obscene Dunkin' Donuts video, Chapman's YouTube channel was devoted to marketing videos, including this one for Happy Wok . 'So I know they're probably sh*ttin' and p*ssin in it, because they really don't give a sh*t,' she says loudly. 'That's why I'm not eating this food, I'm giving it to my boyfriend.' The worst is yet to come, though, when Chapman spies the woman she believed was rude to her the night before. 'Well, guess what? This s**t’s about to go live, b***h. Right on Facebook,' she rants. 'Cause I already posted what your dumb ass did last night. So I hope . you’re happy with your little f****g sand n****r self. Cause I’m about . to nuke your whole f****g planet from Mars. You think ya’ll are tough . big fat Arabs bombin’ the Trade Center? I’ll show you tough,' she yells . to the woman, who calmly goes about her business behind the counter. Chapman's LinkedIn profile says she's currently the marketing manager for Comfort Care Medical Equipment, but according to The Smoking Gun the company says she hasn't worked there for more than a year. Chapman, . whose LinkedIn profile says she went to Nova Southeastern University in . Orlando, also has a YouTube channel on which she has posted numerous . marketing videos of low production quality. Expressing her excitement at posting the . video, she says, 'Hi Facebook, this is what you have to do in life, it . f*****g sucks.

"Former U.S. Senator Bob Kerrey thinks President Barack Obama, a fellow Democrat, was re-elected in 2012 because he 'sucked less' than former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. The Nebraskan straight-talker told MailOnline in an exclusive interview that Obama isn't up to the job of bringing liberals and conservatives to the table to rescue America's slowly choking entitlement programs. And Obama, he said Wednesday in his Manhattan office, knew full well he was lying when he promised that the Affordable Care Act would allow Americans to keep insurance plans they liked. 'He had to know he was misleading the audience,' Kerrey said quietly, recalling the newly minted president's countless promises as Congress and the public debated his signature health insurance overhaul. Not your typical Democrat: Former Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey opened up with MailOnline about his disappointments with his party and his president . 'If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan': Kerrey says many politicians suffer from 'self-delusion' that makes it easier to lie to the public . 'On the other hand, he may have said it so many times,' he added, 'that the spell-checker wasn't in the room – the spell-checker, the fact-checker – somebody who says, ""Excuse me, Mr. President, but I hope you know this...""' Obama's infamous four-Pinocchio pledges, Kerrey explained, never stood a chance of being fulfilled because there were 'a million people out there with policies that, for one reason or another, run short of the minimum standard. I mean, they bought something cheaper!' The White House understood the numbers, Kerrey said, and Republicans did a poor job of explaining the basics of the insurance industry to low-information voters. Insurers, he said the GOP could have made clear, make money by 'not paying claims,' and by making sure that '80 per cent of the people that are buying insurance don't need it. ... So I need young people to sign up. That's what it's all about.' The worst lie Democrats told about Obamacare, Kerrey reasoned, 'is not ""If you want to keep your health care plan..."" – the worst one is, ""Everybody deserves high-quality, affordable health care.""' 'Excuse me? Uh, I don't know if you've heard about the bell curve?' he snarked. 'If I've got 1,000 doctors, 100 are great, and 100 are not so good.' He outlined the shape of a bell curve with his hands, and then threw them skyward. 'It's absolutely impossible,' he said. 'And affordable? Forget about it.' Kerry is best known for calling former Sen. Rick Santorum an '***hole' in the Philadelphia Inquirer, and for calling Bill Clinton an 'unusually good liar' Kerry has kept his oar in foreign policy, helming the New School for many years in New York City where he rubbed elbows with foreign leaders like German Chancellor Angela Merkel (L) When the Affordable Care Act met its most vigorous Republican opposition in late 2009, the U.S. economy was still floundering and the business community's eyes were focused on GDP growth, not a new set of health-benefit mandates. 'I wouldn't have done health care,' Kerrey said.'I think the big mistake was ... to say, ""Whew! We've got the stimulus done, okay, the economy's going to come bouncing back in 12 months – let's do health care,""' he explained. 'Only the economy didn't come bouncing back.' 'We're teetering on the edge of going . out of business through most of 2009,' Kerrey recalled. 'And I think . you need to just keep driving, driving, driving on the economy, and make . it as bipartisan as possible.' Life-long pol: In 1992 then-Sen. Kerry made an ultimately failed bid for the Democratic presidential nomination that eventually went to Bill Clinton . Obama compounded his rhetorical mistakes with political ones, he said, by agreeing to ditch a proposal allowing Americans to buy into the Medicare system the way they would buy a policy from a private insurer. '""And now you want to do health care,"" Kerrey imagined Democratic pols telling Obama near the end of his first year in office. 'It's okay, you're going to do health care. I haven't talked you out of it, Mr. President. [But] don't give on the public option.' Even if the Obamacare law had died in Congress, he insisted, the politics of holding fast to the public option would have favored Democrats since Medicare is among the federal government's most universally popular programs. 'I would have been much better off campaigning saying, ""My opponent does not want you to have the right to buy into Medicare,""' Kerrey mused. In his Washington, D.C. days, the former Nebraska governor often stood out as the rare Democrat who publicly lamented U.S. entitlement programs' seemingly unstoppable march to insolvency. 'We're robbing from the future to pay for the past,' he told MailOnline on Wednesday. 'We just are.' 'And we're shoveling more and more money to people over the age of 65.' A . lack of political will and a healthy dose of electoral fear, he said, . has virtually guaranteed a climate inside the U.S. Capitol where no one . will take the first step toward cutting benefits or ratcheting up the . national retirement age. 'It's the one thing ""R""s and ""D""s can agree on,' Kerrey explained. 'Don't screw with seniors.' Kerrey is a decorated Navy SEAL veteran who has grappled with issues of conscience: He once acknowledged that a Vietnam combat mission for which he was awarded the Bronze Star caused the deaths of 13 to 20 unarmed civilians, most of them women and children . The result, he said, is a set of financial chains clamped tightly on future generations. During an ill-fated 2012 run to recapture his old Senate seat, Kerrey  totaled up Uncle Sam's spending on Medicare, Social Security, and the long-term care portion of Medicaid, and divided it by the number of Americans in the work force. 'All workers,' he insisted, 'including government workers! And the source of their contribution is entirely tax money! But take all of it.' The cost, he determined, 'is $15,000 per year, per worker.' Once a politician ... Kerrey tried to win back his old Senate seat in 2012, only to be beaten in the primary by Deb Fischer, who ultimately won the general election . Asked how to break the congressional logjam, Kerrey thought for a moment and said, softly, 'It takes a president. It takes a president.' Is Barack Obama that president? Kerrey stayed silent but shook his head. 'I'm shaking my head ""no,""' he acknowledged, finally. 'If he was up to it, he would have done it. He can't run for re-election.' Another of Obama's failings, according to Kerrey, is an inflated sense of Americans' appetite for programs to correct what the White House calls 'income inequality,' through new taxes and other income-shifting initiatives that transfer wealth from the rich to the poor. The president's re-election 17 months ago wasn't a mandate to conduct class warfare, he said. 'After the 2012 election, what the president needed was somebody to say, ""Mr. President, I'm thrilled you won. You stand for all the things I support. But honestly, you won this election because you sucked less than Romney.""' Americans, Kerrey believes, lost patience equally with the GOP and the White House during the kabuki theater of fiscal cliff, congressional 'super committee,' budget sequester and tense partial government shutdown. Obama stuck to his guns at the time, holding out for a 'balanced' budget-gap fix that included new taxes on upper-income Americans. 'Everybody since 1913 has had a mandate to raise taxes on the rich,' Kerrey scoffed at his party's leader. 'This isn't something that you've earned, something that's unique.' Coplorful: As governor of Nebraska, Kerrey dated actress Debra Winger for more than two years, telling reporters that she 'swept me off my foot' (He lost part of one leg in the Vietnam war.) Obama isn't the first president to make that kind of miscalculation – Kerrey calls it 'self-delusion' – while in office. He joked that geneticists will one day soon 'find a base pair' of genes that predisposes people to deception. And he predicted, half-seriously, that 'they'll find another base pair which say that politicians have 25 per cent more capacity for – you call it lying, I call it self-delusion.' Bill Clinton, Kerrey once famously hinted, may have been that genetic trait's Darwinian ideal. 'He's an unusually good liar. Unusually good,' the Nebraskan said in 1994. He told MailOnline that he 'actually intended it as a compliment,' although Clinton 'didn't take it that way.' Obama's lies, he said, stem from the same human flaw. 'That self-delusion moment comes in a single declaratory sentence,' Kerrey said, which is, ""If they just get to know me, they'll vote for me.""' 'It's just self-delusion. ... Some of us are good at it, and some of us are bad.'","Kerrey, a two-term Senator in the '80s and '90s, is disappointed in the president for risking the health of the U.S. economy over Obamacare .

"Police have released images of three Chelsea football fans they believe were involved in an allegedly racist incident on a Paris Metro train. The Metropolitan Police are appealing for help to identify the trio, who they think were among a group of Chelsea supporters who pushed a black man off the train and chanted a racist song while on the way to a Champions League match against Paris Saint-Germain in the French capital on Tuesday. Friday's appeal comes as Chelsea  suspended another two people from Stamford Bridge following investigations into the incident, taking the total number to five. Chelsea fans were filmed chanting 'We're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it' while on the train . Chelsea fans stopped a black man getting on the train before their side's match with Paris Saint-Germain . The man was twice prevented from getting on the carriage as the fans pushed him back on to the platform . The Metropolitan police released images of three men they are keen to speak to following the incident in Paris . The three singled out by the Met in images taken from the Metro are not the same as the trio initially suspended by Chelsea. The club reiterated its promise to ban for life anyone proved to have been involved in the racist altercation and is helping police in the UK and Paris. Footage captured by a bystander appears to show a commuter, identified in media reports as French-Mauritian Souleymane S, being pushed back on to the platform amid chants of 'we're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it'. The club had already suspended three men while its investigations continued, and on Friday evening announced that two more people would be barred. 'Chelsea Football Club has suspended a further two people from Stamford Bridge as a result of ongoing investigations into the incident on the Paris Metro on Tuesday evening. This makes a total of five to date,' a statement on the club website said. 'If it is deemed there is sufficient evidence of their involvement in the incident, the club will issue banning orders for life.' A club spokesman revealed Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich (right) is 'disgusted' by the incident . Chelsea insist they have apologised in writing to Souleymane and invited him and his family to London to attend the second leg of the European clash against PSG on March 11, while a spokesman stated that owner Roman Abramovich is 'disgusted' by the incident. In an interview given to BBC Radio 5 Live on Friday afternoon, Souleymane argued that Chelsea hold a degree of liability for the conduct of their fans and has yet to receive any contact from Stamford Bridge. 'Chelsea are partly responsible and I have brought a complaint. They have partial responsibility because it's their supporters,' Souleymane said. 'Chelsea need to call my lawyers and they haven't done that yet, unlike PSG. Their director general has called my lawyer and he called me. I haven't had any reply from Chelsea. Nothing.' Mourinho, speaking about the incident for the first time, has revealed his own anguish but stresses that the men involved should not be viewed as genuine fans of the club. 'We feel ashamed but maybe we shouldn't because we - I - refuse to be connected with these people,' Mourinho said. 'I'm connected with Chelsea and the many good things this club defends and represents. I left Chelsea in 2007 and I couldn't wait to come back. 'I felt ashamed when I knew what happened, but I repeat I'm a proud Chelsea manager because I know what this club is. 'I feel ashamed to have been connected with this sad episode that happened and I have no more words.' Jose Mourinho (left) admits he feels 'ashamed' by the racially-motivated incident involving Chelsea fans . Mourinho, who wants Souleymane to visit Stamford Bridge because he 'probably has the wrong idea about Chelsea', confirmed that his views are shared in the dressing room. 'The reaction of the players is the same reaction that we all have,' said Mourinho. 'I have a squad at Chelsea where 12 or 14 players have African nationality or an African connection. 'Our dressing room has always had big principles of equality over everything - race, religion, everything. 'So the dressing room reacted in the same way I did, with disappointment and obviously condemning the situation and supporting the gentleman involved. 'But there is also the feeling that while we feel ashamed, maybe we shouldn't because we are not this and these people don't belong to us. 'Since minute one we have done absolutely everything because we have zero tolerance to this. We have to keep feeling our club is a great club and has no space for people like this.' Branislav Ivanovic gives Chelsea the lead on Tuesday night in their Champions League last 16 tie with PSG . The Chelsea team applaud their travelling fans at the Parc des Princes stadium on Tuesday night . Mourinho's weekly press conference ahead of Saturday's Barclays Premier League match against Burnley at Stamford Bridge was dominated by discussion of the racist abuse witnessed on the Paris underground. A club spokesman opened proceedings with a statement in which he said Chelsea were 'appalled by what we saw', branding the incident as 'unforgivable' and declaring that 'the people involved do not represent Chelsea football club'. When Mourinho was asked how offensive it is that the supporters used the name of club captain John Terry to justify their actions, the spokesman intervened by saying: 'We're not interested in any excuses or stories to try and cover these actions'. Terry was given a four-match ban and fined £220,000 in 2012 after being found guilty by the Football Association of racially abusing QPR defender Anton Ferdinand. Chelsea fans let off a flare inside the Parc des Princes during the last 16 first leg encounter on Tuesday night . Chelsea fans are kept back by police after the final whistle of the Champions League match on Tuesday night . Mourinho was also referred to his comments relating to last October's calls to introduce the 'Rooney Rule' when he declared 'there is no racism in football'. 'I was asked about players choosing players or managers or not choosing them because of their race. Maybe I am naive, but I think that no club refuses a top manager or player because of his race,' he said. 'This is what I said. I did not say there is no racism in football. This not football, this is society, it is public transport. Maybe the people with Chelsea scarves don't even like football or Chelsea. I don't know.' Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck met with Kick it Out chairman Lord Ouseley on Friday as a demonstration of club's commitment to fighting discrimination and racism.

Research found one in three parents don't understand what their children do for a living . Deutsche Bank, Edelman, Logitech and Regus are among the companies that have already signed up, while Google already runs its own official 'parents-in-the-office day'. A survey by the LinkedIn found that childrens' jobs are confusing for parents because the nature and tools of work have changed. More than a third (35 per cent) of parents surveyed confessed they were not completely familiar with what their child does for a living. Half said they could be of benefit to their offsrping if they had a better understanding of their career, while 59 per cent said they want to know more about their child's employment. 'The world of work is changing rapidly and many jobs of today didn’t exist even 10 years ago,' said LinkedIn's head of talent Pat Wadors. 'While our parents are proud of us no matter what we do, they would be even prouder if they better understood our careers.' LinkedIn recently trialled the scheme in its Dublin office, where around 100 parents came in to learn . more about the company, and to see what their children do. LinkedIn trialled the initiative at its office in Dublin, pictured. Deutsche Bank, Edelman, Logitech and Regus are among the companies that have already signed up to the campaign . 'The results were overwhelmingly positive', continued Wadors, 'One mother . remarked that she had no idea how valued her daughter was at work and it . made her proud.' Despite the changes in the workplace over the past decade, LinkedIn also believes parents 'can be a valuable part' of a professional network because they may have faced similar challenges and learned . valuable lessons along the way. 'It’s bridging a gap that will make for better relationships,' continued Danielle Restivo, LinkedIn’s head of global corporate communications.","The Bring In Your Parents Day is scheduled for Thursday 7 November .

"King Arthur had the right idea - seat people on a round table and they are less likely to be argumentative and more likely to feel 'they belong', new research claims. But put them in rows, such as a row of candidates opposite Alan Sugar on The Apprentice, and it is more likely to bring out a person's 'individual' streak. The findings could be useful for the layouts of classrooms, restaurants and hotel lobbies, said economic professors. Strategic: Canadian researchers found that people seated in a circular pattern were less likely to argue than those sat in a square or in a row . It could even make the difference to the way people feel at events like weddings or in a meeting, said the study for the Journal of Consumer Research. Canadian researchers sat volunteers around different shaped tables and analysed their reactions to a variety of advertising. They found that those seated in a circle or oval were more positive about adverts which conveyed groups - such as a family or a bunch of friends. Those seated in angular arrangements, such as in a square or rectangle, identified more with those ads portraying individuals or mavericks. You're fired!: The Apprentice's angular boardroom can set people up for confrontations and bring out a person's 'maverick streak', according to researchers . Subconsciously, the style of seating brings out one of two conflicting attitudes, said the researchers from Alberta and British Columbia universities. Authors Juliet Zhu and Jennifer Argo wrote: 'The geometric shape of a seating arrangement can impact consumers by priming one of two fundamental needs - the need to belong or the need to be unique.' They added: 'Seating arrangements influence consumers in a wide range of settings such as restaurants, hotel lobbies, public transit, or waiting areas in airports and doctors' offices. 'Circular-shaped seating arrangements prime a need to belong while angular shaped seating arrangements prime a need to be unique.' Dog eat dog: The findings could have implications for businesses who hold regular meetings and want increase productivity and avoid confrontations between colleagues . Circular seating arrangements are often used on TV to convey a warmer, conversational approach, such as with football pundits on Match of the Day. Graham Norton's guests, for instance, are sat together on a curved sofa and his chair is positioned as an extension of the same semi circle to produce a chatty, friendly show. But when Jeremy Paxman famously grilled an increasingly flustered Michael Howard on Newsnight, they were positioned geometrically opposite each other. That interview is now famous for being confrontational with Paxman asking the then Tory Home Secretary to repeatedly answer the same question he felt he was avoiding. On The Apprentice, the candidates sit at one side of a long rectangle table and the panel led by Lord Sugar at the other, and the result is a lot more confrontational. The researchers added: 'The shape of a seating arrangement, a subtle environmental cue, can activate fundamental human needs, and these needs in turn affect consumer responses.'","Canadian researchers found that sitting around a circular table made people feel as if they belonged to a group and in turn less argumentative .
But angular tables made people show more selfish traits in a group .
The findings could have implications for classrooms, boardrooms and even the humble dinner party ."
"This is the moment an impoverished government clerk from a desolate region of eastern India became the first person ever to win $1million on an Indian game show. Sushil Kumar, whose family is so poor they couldn't afford a television . set, claimed the staggering win on the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. Mr Kumar's win echoes the plot of the 2008 Oscar-winning film Slumdog Millionaire, whose impoverished protagonist, played by Dev Patel, wins the grand prize on the show. Sushil Kumar reacts after winning the $1million jackpot on India's version of Who wants to be a Millionaire, hosted by Bollywood legend Amitabh Bachchan . Life imitates art: Kumar's win echoes film Slumdog Millionaire, whose impoverished protagonist played by Dev Patel (pictured left) won the grand prize . The 26-year-old and his wife of five . months, Seema, wept when Indian movie legend Amitabh Bachchan, the show's host, . handed them a cheque for 50 million rupees (just over $1 million) after . the contestant gave all nine right answers on the show. 'You have created history. Your grit and determination has made you come so far in this show,' Bachchan said. On his blog, Bachchan described the record-breaking moment: 'He waited till almost eternity to decide on that final answer. The entire place just exploded. The family of the contestant ran on to the set in uncontrollable joy and screams and tears of happiness, whilst the live audience were whooping it up on their feet with the loudest scream I have ever heard.' The winner's brother, Sunil Kumar Patel, told the Guardian: 'We can't believe it. The whole village has come to our house. we are worried that my dad will die of happiness. 'We can't speak to Sushil. his mobile is off because he is out with the stars and on and off planes.' Kumar had only learned two weeks ago that he had been chosen to appear on the show - which is called Kaun Banega Crorepati in Hindi. Winner: Sushil Kumar and his wife pose with the show's host Bachchan - and the jackpot cheque . Mr Kumar shows his delight after answering the final question correctly . Before . Kumar went on the program, which was filmed on Tuesday and will air next . week, he was a £90-a-month government office worker and . supplemented his income by working as a private tutor in the small town . of Motihari in the eastern state of Bihar - one of the poorest regions in India. Kumar . told viewers his family was too poor to have a television, forcing him to go to a neighbour's home to watch the quiz show. Watching him tick off correct answer after correct answer, his neighbours persuaded him to try out for the show, he said. The trip to the Mumbai studio where the show is taped was his first ride in a plane and his first visit to a big city, he said. Many in the country who enter the show say that just meeting Bachchan is enough to make them happy. Kumar had clear, if modest, plans for the money. Love interest: Dev Patel (left) stars as Jamal in the film, while Freida Pinto (right) stars as Latika in Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire . He said he will use some to pay for a preparatory course so he can take India's tough civil service exam, which could lead to a secure and prestigious lifetime job. He said he will also buy a new home for his wife, pay off his parents' debts and give his brothers start-up cash so they can set up small businesses. And he plans to build a library in Motihari so the children of his village will have access to the books and knowledge he so desperately craved, he said. The win has as transformed Mr Kumar into a role model for millions of aspiring youngsters yearning to escape from lives of poverty and find a role in India's burgeoning economy. Gameshows regularly get audiences in the tens of millions.

"A  lawmaker wants to hand out Vladimir Putin's sperm to Russian women en masse in a bid to create a new generation of 'military and political elite'. Yelena Borisovna Mizoulina, the Chairwoman of Parliamentary Commission on women's affairs, children and family, told colleagues that giving the president's sperm to would-be mothers would improve patriotism in Russia. Ms Mizoulina, who has a PhD in law, made the bizarre proposal during a round table discussion on  fertility in Russia. A lawmaker wants to hand out Vladimir Putin's sperm en masse to Russian women in a bid to improve patriotism in the country . According to the Russian-language newspaper, Trust, she told the State Duma that Putin's brood would then be given 'special allowances' from the state, in return for their  'devotion' to the country. She said: 'The essence of my proposition is simple. 'Every citizen of Russia will receive by mail the genetic material of the president, to get pregnant from him and have a baby. These mothers will receive a special allowance from the state.' Yelena Borisovna Mizoulina told colleagues that giving the President's sperm to would-be mothers would create a new 'military and political elite' Adopting the assumption that Putin's offspring would be male, she went on to describe how the children would be educated in 'special institutions that resemble Souvorov Schools' - a type of boarding school in the former Soviet Union. The aim would be that the child would be 'devoted to the homeland and personally to the President of the Russian Fedaration', she said. She added: 'Children born from the Russian president in the future will form the military and political elite of the state.' But Mikhail Klikishin told the Observer the story is 'total BS from Ukrainian yellow press'. The open discussion about Putin's sperm is out of the ordinary. The Kremlin usually gives nothing away about the president's private life. Putin also becomes prickly when asked about his family. Putin's two daughters, Maria and Yekaterina, and their private lives are protected by a strictly obeyed code of silence among Russia's media. There is also ongoing speculation about Putin's relationship with Alina Kabayeva, 30, who was first named as the president’s mistress five years ago. Putin divorced his wife, Lyudmila, 55, earlier this year. Ms Mizoulina is infamous for her strange law-making suggestions. She recently recommended that all Russian Jews consider leaving the country, stating: 'We have enough problems'. Earlier this year, she also introduced a bill that banned higher education for young women who had yet to give birth. She also drafted a law prohibiting 'sexual intercourse in the territory of the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol.' The law was not adopted.","Yelena Borisovna Mizoulina made bizarre proposal during round table debate .

"A Central Texas man who shot and killed a sheriff's deputy entering his home will not be charged with capital murder, attorneys said Thursday. A local grand jury declined Wednesday to indict Henry Goedrich Magee for the December death of Burleson County Sgt. Adam Sowders, who was part of a group of investigators executing a search warrant for Magee's rural home. Sowders and other officers entered the home about 90 miles northwest of Houston without knocking just before 6 a.m. Authorities were looking for guns and marijuana. Magee's attorney, Dick DeGuerin, said his client thought he was the victim of a home invasion, reached for a gun and opened fire. DeGuerin has acknowledged his client had a small number of marijuana plants and seedlings, as well as guns he owned legally. No charges: A local grand jury declined Wednesday to indict Henry Goedrich Magee for the December death of Burleson County Sgt. Adam Sowders . The grand jury did indict Magee for possession of marijuana while in possession of a deadly weapon, a third-degree felony. 'This was a terrible tragedy that a deputy sheriff was killed, but Hank Magee believed that he and his pregnant girlfriend were being robbed,' DeGuerin said in an interview Thursday. 'He did what a lot of people would have done,' DeGuerin added. 'He defended himself and his girlfriend and his home.' The longtime defense attorney said he could not immediately remember another example of a Texas grand jury declining to indict a defendant in the death of a law enforcement officer. Julie Renken, the district attorney for Burleson County, said in a statement Thursday she thought the sheriff's office acted correctly during events that 'occurred in a matter of seconds amongst chaos.' 'I believe the evidence also shows that an announcement was made,' Renken said. 'However, there is not enough evidence that Mr. Magee knew that day that Peace Officers were entering his home.' Magee is still in custody in neighboring Washington County, but should be soon released on bond since he only faces a marijuana possession charge, DeGuerin said. Julie Renken, the district attorney for Burleson County, said in a statement Thursday she thought the sheriff's office acted correctly during events that 'occurred in a matter of seconds amongst chaos.' Renken said her office would 'fully prosecute' that case. The 31-year-old Sowders was a native of Somerville who had recently been promoted to a sergeant-investigator position. Magee's attorney, Dick DeGuerin of Houston, called the fatal shooting a tragic accident. He said Magee was asleep and didn't know sheriff's deputies were entering his rural home near Somerville, about 90 miles northwest of Houston. 'Hank, like any homeowner, defended himself and his pregnant girlfriend,' DeGuerin said in December.DeGuerin said sheriff's deputies did not knock on the door or announce who they were when they entered the home. 'This is something that could have happened to anyone protecting their home at night,' he said. Christine Labertew, spokeswoman for the Burleson County Sheriff's Office, said Monday she did not know if or how deputies announced their entrance into the home. She said they were not wearing body cameras during the incident.","Henry Goedrich Magee gunned down Sgt. Adam Sowders on December 19 after he and other law enforcement entered Magee's home .

"Four children have been orphaned after their wealthy mother and father plunged to their deaths just days apart. First Tilly Lamb, 43, died after falling from the third floor of a holiday apartment in Morocco where the family were staying. Four days later, reportedly overcome . by grief, Roger Lamb, 47, plummeted from the second floor balcony of a . luxury city centre hotel. Double holiday death: Mathilde, known as Tilly, and her husband Roger Lamb died within days of each other in Morocco . Yesterday relatives were struggling to comfort the couple’s devastated children – four ‘intelligent, high-flying’ boys. The children are being cared for by an aunt after flying back to Britain from Morocco. Meanwhile police are trying to establish how and why the parents met their deaths. But their inquiry is being clouded by . distressing and confused information. There has been speculation about . whether suicide or foul play were involved, or if the double tragedy was . a terrible coincidence. Family loss: Mathilde Lamb, known as Tilly, fell to her death from an apartment. She is pictured here on a skiing holiday . Orphaned: Roger Lamb with his four sons . Mr Lamb was a geotechnical engineer with 24 years' experience in the construction industry . The family was ripped apart as Mr . Lamb, an engineer, was apparently trying to take his wife and sons to . New Zealand, where he was working in the wake of the earthquakes that . struck Christchurch in September 2010 and February this year. The couple’s £850,000 farmhouse in a Worcestershire village was at one stage on the market. Mr Lamb told colleagues in Christchurch that the family would be joining him and was said to be house-hunting. The trip to the exclusive resort of . Essaouira on Morocco’s western Atlantic coast united them for a period . of relaxation, during which they could talk about the move. Luxury: Roger Lamb died after falling from a second floor balcony at the Essaouira Sofitel, pictured, the day after his wife died . Family home: The couple lived in this £850,000 home near Pershore, Worcestershire. However, Mr Lamb had relocated to Christchurch, New Zealand, and was planning on moving his wife and children out there . 'Pillars of the community': Roger Lamb died the day after his wife passed away . However there was confusion over . whether the couple had agreed on the emigration plan, and conflicting . reports about whether Mr Lamb would stay in New Zealand or come home. His friend and former colleague . Julian Maund, 53, said: ‘No one knows exactly what happened. Roger was . devoted to Tilly and would have been distraught when she died. 'I’m . certainly not aware of any marital problems between the couple, so it . couldn’t be anything like that. ‘He rang me three weeks ago to say he . was coming home. I got the impression he was coming home for good and . was looking forward to being with his family again. ‘He was enthusiastic and dedicated and I am completely in shock at his death.’ The British Embassy in Rabat confirmed that the couple died days apart in separate locations. A spokesman said that Mathilde Lamb, . known as Tilly, fell from an apartment in Essaouira on August 17. She . was taken to hospital and died there on August 20. Mr Lamb was found critically injured . some 18 hours later on August 21 beneath a balcony at a the five-star . Sofitel hotel in the centre of Essaouira. He was taken to the same . hospital but transferred 250 miles away to a specialist unit in . Marrakech, where he died on Sunday. Last night the family’s home community of Pensham, near Pershore in Worcestershire, was in ‘massive shock’. Tourist getaway: The medina old town of Essaouira, Morocco, where the couple were on holiday . Mrs Lamb’s 90-year-old mother . Rosamund Sain-Ley-Berry, who lives two miles away in the village of . Great Comberton, was said to be ‘terribly distraught’ and was being . comforted by her church minister. The Rev Terry Henderson dedicated a service to the family, whom friends described as ‘pillars of the community’. Holiday fall: Roger Lamb was rushed 250 miles to a hospital in Marrakesh but could not be saved . Mr Lamb, who listed his interests as ‘family, fell-running and horses’, went to the same school as his wife. He married her in 1992 after graduating from Birmingham University and setting up his own business. He was a geotechnic engineer, . specialising in the movement and behaviour of the earth, often in . relation to the safety of buildings. Landing a contract with architectural and environmental engineering firm GHD in Christchurch must have been a dream job. But it meant leaving his family . behind for a time. The younger two boys attend the local church primary . school and the elder two go to High School nearby in Evesham. Mrs Lamb ran an upmarket bed and breakfast business, accommodating guests in a converted outbuilding in the farmhouse grounds. Twelve thousand miles away in Christchurch, Mr Lamb appears to have been impressed with the lifestyle. A keen horseman, he joined the city’s carriage-driving club and made a circle of friends. Staff there described him as ‘a genuinely nice bloke, a real gentleman’. Last night his brother-in-law Mark . Rogerson confirmed there had been discussions about the family moving to .

"A popular high school basketball coach believes he lost his job after a disgruntled and vengeful parent emailed a controversial film he acted in ten years ago to the school principal. Mike Hvizdo, who worked at Weston High School in Connecticut, was asked to resign on February 6 after administrators saw a short film called Forbidden Fruit that he acted in back in 2003. The nine-minute black and white comedy video contains vulgar language and raunchy themes but no pornography, nudity or illegal material. School officials said the film was 'offensive' and compromised Hvizdo's position as coach of the Trojans basketball team. In the three weeks since Hvizdo left his job, he has received huge support from the Weston community and the vast majority of parents. Scroll down for video . Successful: Mike Hvizdo (right), popular basketball coach at Weston High School, was forced to leave his job after a controversial video from ten years ago resurfaced . The Weston Forum reported that a 'general consensus among the school basketball community was that a parent brought the issue to the school’s attention.' And The Hour claimed that a parent 'upset with the way their son was being treated as a WHS basketball player' sent the video to Weston High principal, Lisa Wolak. The paper added that the 'inquiry into Hvizdo's past was nothing more than a blatant attack with the sole goal of getting the coach removed.' It is reported that Hvizdo met with school officials and was forced to resign, citing 'personal reasons.' Weston High then sent a letter to parents which stated: 'This film is vulgar, contains offensive sexual language, and depicts sexual acts among multiple partners in which Mr. Hvizdo is a participant.' 'Unfortunately, material posted on the Internet takes on a life of its own, and there is no way to guarantee that this video will not be viewed by our entire community and most importantly, by our student athletes, now and into the future,' it continued. Dedicated: Most parents at the school have said that Hizdo is a good role model . Hvizdo disagrees, telling ABC . 'It may not be the type of film everyone likes to watch but nothing . illegal, pornographic whatsoever, and no nudity … and I was an actor.' The coach said that his job is 'not just about teaching these kids basketball. It’s about teaching them life lessons.' 'I don’t make a lot of money,' he explained to ABC. 'I do it because I love it. They’re my sons, 30 sons.' The . film was produced and written by Steve . Moremarco who was an assistant to Jack Black and has gone on to work on . TV shows like Everybody Hates Chris and ER, and the film School Of Rock. Moremarco has explained his side of the story on his blog, Moremarkable, stating: 'Mike Hvizdo did NOTHING WRONG. I did NOTHING WRONG. 'This . was a movie for adults, by adults, created by artists working in their . craft. If the movie that Mike was in was The Hangover Part 2 – would . there be any outcry?! Would the filmmaker be called and asked to keep . the film private?' Moremarco asked. Weston . High parents have rallied round Hvizdo - over 100 people turned up at a . education board meeting last Monday in support of the coach. Jonathan Bombart, who has a son on the team, told the Weston Forum . that Hvizdo was hugely dedicated to his work. 'He was really good for . the kids,' said Mr. Bombart. 'He taught them great life lessons. The . kids loved him.' 'I don¿t make a lot of money,' Hvizdo said of his coaching job. 'I do it because I love it. They¿re my sons, 30 sons.' Kay Spencer, a parent of a student at Weston High School, told ABC that Hvizdo was an excellent influence on the teenagers. 'Coach . Hvizdo’s been very involved with all of the kids in the community. We . definitely believe that he is a good role model and a good person,' she . said. Weston resident . Philip Hover told The Hour he was looking forward to his son joining . Hvizdo's team next year: 'I'd be honored to have Mike Hvizdo coach my . son,' Hover said. '(The . movie) has absolutely nothing to do with teaching kids to play . basketball. I would be happy to have him coach here. This is a . miscarriage of justice. No one in this room can say they haven't uttered . a vulgarity. Coach Viz should be re-instated. Let he who is without sin . cast the first stone.' 'This . is the worst case of (Hvizdo) being bullied,' actor Joe Pantoliano told . the board. 'This is such a wonderful opportunity for this community to . teach that we make mistakes. Re-instate Mike.' The school district now says it is 'continuing its review of the matter.' Weston High School officials said the film was 'offensive' and compromised Hvizdo's position as coach of the Trojans basketball team .

"Pope Francis has revealed that around one in every 50 Catholic priests is a paedophile. Condemning the issue as a ‘leprosy’ which infects the Church, the Pontiff was yesterday reported as claiming that even bishops and cardinals are among the ‘2 per cent’ carrying out child abuse. He also said that many more in the Church are guilty of covering it up, adding: ‘This state of affairs is intolerable.’ Pope Francis has revealed that one in every fifty Catholic priests is a paedophile, it has been reported . Damning reports by the UN this year have accused the Vatican of ‘systematically’ adopting policies that allowed priests to rape and molest thousands of children over decades, failing to report allegations to the authorities and transferring offenders to new dioceses where they could abuse again. In a wide-ranging interview with the Italian newspaper La Repubblica yesterday, Francis denounced the corruption of children as ‘the most terrible and unclean thing imaginable’ and vowed to ‘confront it with the seriousness it demands’. The Pope’s comments come as Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby warned that fresh child abuse would be uncovered in the Church of England. Asked on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show yesterday whether more cases would emerge, he said: ‘I would love to say there weren’t but I expect there are. ‘There are in almost every institution in this land.’ He added that the Church needed to apologise and explain how ‘utterly devastated’ it was about its history child abuse. He said: ‘It is becoming clearer and clearer that for many, many years things were not dealt with as they should have been dealt with. We must show justice to survivors of abuse.’ While Pope Francis has carried out sweeping reforms to the Vatican, he has been accused of not doing enough to tackle the child abuse crisis. The Pope reportedly told Italian newspaper la Repubblica that abuse of children was like 'leprosy' infecting the Church . In his interview, Francis was quoted as saying: ‘The Church is fighting for the eradication of the habit and for education that rehabilitates. 'But this leprosy is also present in our house. Many of my colleagues who are working against it tell me that paedophilia inside the Church is at the level of 2 per cent.’ He said that the figures supplied by Church officials were supposed to reassure him, but added: ‘But I have to say that they do not reassure me by any means. ‘On the contrary, I find them deeply concerning. Among the 2 per cent who are paedophiles are even bishops and cardinals.’ Last night Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said the newspaper’s report had ‘captured the spirit’ of the conversation, but denied that Francis had said there are some cardinals who are paedophiles. In his interview, the Pope acknowledged that paedophilia was common and widespread in the Catholic Church, and reportedly called the requirement for celibacy among priests ‘a problem’ for which he is ‘finding the solution’ – although the Vatican also denied that he said this. Last week Pope Francis issued his strongest words on paedophile priests so far as he held a historic three-hour meeting with six abuse victims, including two from Britain and two from Ireland. The Vatican has since denied that Francis had said that there were some cardinals who were paedophiles . In a mass before the meeting, he begged abuse survivors for forgiveness for the ‘sacrilegious’ crimes committed by ‘the sons and daughters of the Church who have betrayed their mission’. British abuse victim Peter Saunders, 57, who was molested for more than five years by two priests, a teacher and a member of his family from the age of eight, described the experience as ‘life-changing’. The first cases of abuse at the hands of priests came to light in the US and Canada in the 1980s. In the 1990s, revelations began to emerge of widespread abuse in Ireland, before cases were exposed in more than a dozen countries in the last decade. In 2009, two damning reports into allegations of paedophilia in Ireland revealed the extent of cover-ups spanned decades and involved thousands of victims. Last week the Pope said the Catholic Church had been guilty of ‘complicity’ in covering up what he called ‘despicable actions’ and ‘grave sins’. He said members of the Catholic Church should ‘weep before the execrable acts of abuse which have left life-long scars’.","Pope Francis quoted as saying figure included bishops and cardinals .

Customers overwhelmingly voted to ditch the tune, a taped version of which is played over the speakers each time a flight lands on time. On time: Ryanair plans the bugle noise every time it lands on schedule . Over the years customers of the Dublin based carrier have regularly complained, labelling the end of flight bugle call as 'annoying' or 'cheesy'. One even said it made her embarrassed to be Irish. Ryanair said it would drop the bugle following the Twitter vote, although it refused to say whether or not it would replace it with something else. The move to drop the bugle comes as part of a massive charm offensive to change the airline's famously belligerent attitude to criticism. Huge criticism: Ryanair asked on Twitter whether it should stop playing the noise on flights that land on time . This has included introducing quiet times on flights, with fewer announcements early morning or late night. It has also followed some of its budget rivals by allowed allocated seating, fewer restrictions on luggage and an improved website for bookings. Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely said in a statement: 'We asked our followers on Twitter to vote on whether we should change it. 'The people have spoken and after hundreds of votes, they've voted for change, so we're looking forward to unveiling our next customer improvement soon.'","First Call sound is played every time budget airline lands on time .

"Aaron Parfitt, 14, who organised a pupil walk-out at his school because they were being taught by too many supply teachers (and not getting enough homework) As maths problems go, it’s not a tricky one. One despairing schoolboy minus one full-time maths teacher plus two flunked GCSE options exams equals a classroom crisis. When Aaron Parfitt, 14, called a wildcat walkout of pupils to protest about poor standards in maths teaching at his Blackpool high school, he caused a national debate about the prospects for pupils at the 416 British schools in special measures. Now, in an exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday, he reveals that he felt he had to take a stand after he scored just 16 out of a possible 95 in a double maths exam designed to help him choose his GCSE options. He called the strike because he actually wanted extra help with his maths, felt he needed more homework to help him get on, and was fed up with the endless run of supply teachers who failed to turn up on time. ‘I am a normal schoolboy, in the middle set for most things and definitely not very good at maths,’ Aaron says. ‘But I have to have a maths pass at GCSE. This is a pivotal point, you have to knuckle down and get on. I do not want to amble out of school at 16 without decent qualifications. ‘The strike wasn’t about being famous for a few minutes or about making trouble for my school, which I love. It is about my prospects and the success I want to have in life after I have left. I do not want to move schools because that defeats the object of the exercise which is to make my school better for everyone. I will move if I have to, but what about the other children there? How does that help them?’ The schoolyard strike at Bispham High in Blackpool on March 12 made Aaron a teen folk hero and garnered headlines around the world. It also saw him excluded for two days and facing a critical reception from some older pupils when he returned last Tuesday. But he does not regret his actions – even though they further embarrassed a school where, according to Ofsted in January 2013 ‘standards are low and have declined’. Bispham High School, Blackpool - where Aaron organised his sit in to protest against lack of work . On Friday, a third interim report concluded it must stay in special measures. This comes as no surprise to Aaron, whose Year Nine maths lessons lost any rigour when his maths teacher left at Christmas. ‘The teacher who took over from her lasted a fortnight, if that, and then left,’ he says. ‘And that’s when it started to go downhill. 'We were left to do what we wanted; people were eating and drinking in lessons, chatting to friends, not concentrating, just not learning.’ There followed, Aaron estimates, a carousel of six or seven different teachers, some supply, some staff maths teachers drafted in from other classes, before a new teacher was appointed three weeks ago. Some taught him just once, meaning he rarely got the help, or the homework, he needed. He lavishly praises the teacher who left. Asked why, he says: ‘She taught us. She was always in class on time, she helped us, acknowledged our effort, she set us homework and marked our books.’ As a result of the shambles, Aaron complained. He approached a staff maths teacher as well as his own head of year and then saw Bispham’s acting head, Deborah Hanlon-Catlow. When he did not feel he was being taken seriously, he emailed Blackpool Borough Council and Ofsted. '...I don't want to leave without qualifications...' And then, at 12.15pm on March 12, he organised a demonstration outside classroom DO1, his old maths class. He had invited 20 like-minded pupils, but soon the numbers doubled and Aaron had to direct the crowd out to the school field where they sang We Shall Not Be Moved. Teachers came running, believing a fight was in progress. Aaron was ready. ‘I admitted everything. I  had a piece of paper with two bullet points on it. The first point said grades and the second said teaching. 'I didn’t have a plan or a script apart from that – I’d only thought  of it the night before and I hadn’t even confided in my mum. ‘I got the idea of a strike after watching walkouts on the TV. I told my teachers I was sorry but at least I’d got their attention. They said it wasn’t a good kind of attention, that it wasn’t respectful, but I didn’t care. I was glad I finally had some.’ Aaron loves his school, rates  many of his teachers and admires Mrs Hanlon-Catlow, who he says is ‘all about education, very approachable and can get things done’. Yet he, rather than the creaking superstructure of Bispham High, was blamed for the mutiny and excluded for two days. ‘I was shocked,’ he says. ‘I thought I might get detention but I’m not a serial offender, I don’t fight or cause trouble. I have been criticised by kids who are not in my year but my friends are supportive.’ As are his parents, Janet Monkman, 52, who works in a sandwich shop, and taxi driver Philip Monkman, 64. Aaron comes from an ordinary family – two hard-working parents who live in a semi and whose budget stretches no further than an annual break in a British holiday camp. Janet says: ‘Aaron is a lovely boy; he’s kind, well behaved and responsible. 'He is stubborn but in a good way. He won’t back down if  he believes in something. He has achieved what he set out to and we are proud of him for that.’ If you were to give marks for resourcefulness, Aaron would get  an A+. He got himself a role as an extra in Coronation Street last year and works as a reporter for the children’s pages of his local paper. As for the school, it can’t comment on Aaron, but Mrs Hanlon-Catlow said: ‘This is undoubtedly a challenging time. However, we continue to try to improve teaching standards.’ Bispham’s motto is The Best For All, The Best From All, but despite those bold words, its end-of-term report is still going to read: ‘Could  do better.’","Schoolboy from Blackpool, says strike wasn’t about being famous .

"After a 100 year long wait you would think a time capsule would contain something a bit more exciting than a bunch of letters, some flags and council receipts. A mysterious parcel kept in a small Norwegian town since 1912 was opened tonight, but unfortunately there were none of the oil shares they may have hoped for. The package had the instructions ‘May be opened in 2012’ and despite the 90-minute build-up at tonight's ceremony in Otta, central Norway, the contents failed to shake the world. The big opening: After a century-long wait the package was revealed to contain ceremonial flags, memorial documents from the anniversary of the Battle of Kringen and private correspondence as well as records of Norwegian emigrants . Unwrapping: Kjell Voldheim was one of two local museum archivers who opened the 100 year old package in tonight's ceremony . The parcel was left in the council's . care in 1928 by Johan Nygaard, a former chairman of Sel council in Otta, . who had wrapped and sealed it in 1912 on the 300th anniversary of the . legendary Battle of Kringen. The battle stood in Otta in 1612 . between local peasants and Scottish mercenary soldiers on their way . through the Norwegian woods to enlist to fight in the Swedish army . during Kalmar War between Denmark-Norway and Sweden. Miraculously the Norwegian peasants . won and it is believed that the contents of the package may have some . connection to the battle 400 years ago. Although it has spent the last few . years safely stored on display at the local museum, it has been . forgotten a few times over the years and was nearly lost for good in the . fifties during a renovation at the local council and had to be rescued . from the tip. Caretakers: Mr Voldheim and Ms Dahl wore gloves when handling the parcel and its contents . The crowd held its breath as the parcel was placed on the table to be opened . The ceremony earlier tonight saw a 90 . minute build-up to the opening where international guests and local . dignitaries were treated to traditional music and dance before the . package came on stage. The package was brought to a podium by . museum workers Torveig Dahl and Kjell Voldheim who opened it with the . help of the chairman of the council. Mr Voldheim, a registrar at the local museum, said yesterday that they had many ideas of what it may contain. 'We have thought a lot about what it might be.'' he told Norwegian newspaper Verdens Gang. ‘It could be historical documents, or . maybe the Blue Star Diamond from the Titanic which sank in 1912. Although the council is probably hoping it is a bunch of oil shares.’ With gloved hands Ms Dahl and Mr Voldheim carefully opened up the package to reveal… another package. ‘This has something new written on it, . Mr Voldheim said as he held up the smaller parcel. ‘”Ha ha,” he joked . with the crowd before offering the package to Ms Dahl to help him open. Necks were craned to get a view of the . contents which turned out to be memorial flags, including a royal . banner, and documents from early 20th century. Due to the limited time frame Mr Voldheim announced that the contents would be thoroughly investigated backstage . As well as private handwritten . correspondence which appeared to be between Mr Nygaard and others in the . area including the local priest, it contained photographs and . documents connected to the 300th anniversary of the Battle of Kringen. Mr Voldheim said: 'For museum archivers - this is a gold mine. 'We don’t know what we should do with all his. Where are the oil shares?' It also included two newspapers from 1914 - two years after it was meant to have been sealed, something which baffled the historians. The unexplained newspapers were found underneath envelope after envelope of receipts, accountancy and files from the council in Otta including records of people who emigrated to the United States. The date on the package is the 26th of August 1912, which was the 300th anniversary of a famous battle between local peasants and Scottish mercenary soldiers hired by the Swedish army . Do not open: Locals in Otta has kept the parcel safe for a century and tonight's ceremony was eagerly anticipated . Due to the limited time frame Mr Voldheim could not display all of the contents of the package on stage. The pair announced that they will return later tonight to give a full lists of the contents of the package and additional finds.

"Burning: Mariade Kelly's skin weeps and burns following an allergic reaction to hair dye . A mum was left terrified and fighting for her life after suffering an allergic reaction to a bottle of hair dye. Mariade Kelly, 29, ended up in a hospital high-dependency unit after using a bottle of £5.99 Garnier Nutrisse in Black. Just hours after applying it to her hair, Miss Kelly's scalp began to weep with pus and her skin started to itch uncontrollably. But this was just the beginning of her problems as over a 48-hour period her symptoms deteriorated to a life-threatening degree. Her throat closed up, she struggled to breathe and her heart rate jumped to a dangerous 180 beats per minute. Miss Kelly, who started going grey in her early 20s, decided to dye her hair ahead of a trip from her home of Grangemouth, Scotland, to see her fiance Paul's family in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire. The night before she was due to leave, she applied a bottle of Garnier Nutrisse in Black to her hair which she had purchased from her local Superdrug. She said: 'I started going grey when I was quite young so I had used other dyes in the past for years and I thought I would be fine. 'Before I went to bed, I felt some slight itching and my head was a bit uncomfortable. But then it just started getting worse and worse. 'There was yellow pus oozing from my scalp and it had the most horrific smell of burning flesh. 'I knew straightaway that was from the dye but at that point I didn't panic, I just took some anti-histamines and put some Sudocrem on my hairline, where it was starting to blister, before I went to sleep.' Before and after: The horrific effects of the allergic reaction to the hair dye can be seen in these pictures . However, the next morning, Miss Kelly faced the long drive to Scunthorpe with unpleasant pus running down her face. Too ashamed to show her appearance in public, she hid in the car while her fiance, Paul Abdi, 42, a managing director, and children Brooke, 12, and Mya, six, visited service stations en route. However, by the time the party reached Scunthorpe, it was clear that Miss Kelly, a council worker, required urgent medical attention. She said: 'During the journey, I was getting gradually worse all the time. 'Both my eyes swelled up and the skin at the side of my earlobes was really swollen and itchy. 'The worst part was the awful pus that was still oozing from my head all the time. Worried: Mariade Kelly's face swells as the allergic reaction takes hold . 'We went to A&E and I was seen pretty quickly, but at that point, because the reaction was still relatively slight, I was sent home with some anti-histamines and told to keep an eye on it.' That night, Miss Kelly awoke in a panic to find her whole face was swollen and her cheeks had puffed out to double their size. She returned to A&E only to be told to keep taking her medication, but just three hours later she went back to the hospital with a racing heartbeart and shortness of breath and was immediately admitted. She said: 'Paul dropped me off at the front door and went to park the car. 'The first nurse who set eyes on me exclaimed ""Oh my God, this woman is having a terrible reaction"", and by the time Paul came in I was strapped to a heart monitor on a trolley. 'My heart rate was at 180 bpm - around the same rate as a heart attack - and I couldn't breathe. 'My eyelids had swelled completely shut and I couldn't see. 'I was really panicking by this point and even the nurses seemed shocked. 'I was admitted to the high dependency unit and pumped full of anti-histamines and steroid injections. 'It was awful as in the bed next to me there was someone receiving the last rites - I was so scared. 'By this point my skin was actually starting to bruise because it was so swollen.' Miss Kelly spent a further three days in hospital during the time of the incident in January this year. Reaction: A packet of Garnier Nutrisse Black which Mariade Kelly used before her allergic reaction . One of the doctors asked her if she had ever heard of the chemical PPD. An ingredient in many UK hair dyes, para-phenylenediamine (PPD) is a common allergen banned in many European countries. People can become allergic to it at any time, even if they have been exposed to it before without problems. For this reason, it was voted Allergen Of The Year in 2006 by the American Contact Dermatitis Society. Miss Kelly said: 'When he told me it was banned in so many countries I was shocked. 'He told me to check with my GP once I got home to see if that's what was responsible for my reaction and it turned out it was. 'Afterwards I found out it's contained in all sorts of things, from textiles to cosmetics. 'I feel very strongly that PPD should be banned in the UK. 'I didn't do a patch test but I had used dyes with PPD in them for years without any problems and I know I am not the only person who doesn't do the test every time they dye their hair. 'It's horrifying to think it could be in my clothes or in a tube of mascara and I would be none the wiser. 'Now that I have had the reaction once, I will always be allergic to PPD and another reaction could kill me. 'I now have to dye my hair with a semi-permanent dye I order from a health food shop'. 'More people need to know the risks of PPD so they don't have to go through what I went through.' A spokesman for Garnier said: 'We are totally committed to ensuring that our products are safe and that our customers can use them with absolute confidence.'We were very sorry to hear of Ms Kelly's experience in January. 'Ms Kelly has not contacted Garnier and we would encourage her to do so, so that we can offer specialist medical support.' 'A helpline number is provided on all our products and we always offer our support when consumers contact us. 'Allergies to hair colourants are extremely rare but can occur for a very small number of people. 'Ms Kelly's experience shows how important it is to carry out a skin allergy test at least 48 hours before using the colourant each and every time, following the instructions exactly, which are clearly displayed on Garnier Nutrisse hair colour packaging.'","29-year-old struggled to breathe as her heart rate jumped to dangerous levels .

"The largest haul of Viking treasure ever found in Britain has been unearthed by a metal detector enthusiast, it was revealed today. The discovery was found on Church of Scotland land after the detectorist painstakingly searched the unidentified area in Dumfries and Galloway for more than a year. The hoard, which consists of more than a hundred artefacts, many of which are historically unique, is now under the care of the Treasure Trove Unit and is regarded as being of significant international importance. Scroll down for video . An early medieval cross is among the largest hoard of Viking treasure found in the United Kingdom at an undisclosed location on land owned by the Church of Scotland. The cross is engraved with decorations that, experts say, are highly unusual, which finder Derek McLennan believes may represent the four Gospels . The hoard also includes a complete metal vessel containing more objects. It has not yet been emptied and the first step will be to examine its contents by X-ray. Finder Derek McLennan, 47, was left speechless when he made the discovery in early September and was so emotional that when he called his wife she thought that he had been in a car accident. Within the find is an early Christian solid silver cross, thought to date from the Ninth or Tenth centuries. The treasure hoard includes possibly the largest silver pot from the Carolingian dynasty discovered and could be up to 1,200-years-old. The cross is engraved with decorations that, experts say, are highly unusual, which Mr McLennan believes may represent the four Gospels – Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Mr McLennan said: 'I believe they resemble the carvings you can see on the remnants of St Cuthbert's coffin in Durham Cathedral. 'For me, the cross opens up the possibility of an intriguing connection with Lindisfarne and Iona.' It was found amongst dozens of silver arm-rings and ingots two feet below the surface, deeper than his detector was thought to reach. Metal detector enthusiast Derek McLennan has helped to uncover a hoard of medieval and Viking treasures including this golden pin, which has lain buried for centuries in a Scottish churchyard . The excavation was undertaken by Andrew Nicholson, the county archaeologist, and, shortly after, Mr McLennan found a second signal at its base. Further investigations uncovered a second level trove which is of considerably higher quality than the first. It includes possibly the largest silver pot from the Carolingian dynasty discovered and could be up to 1,200-years-old. The oval shape of this gold ring suggests it had been worn. It was found by Derek McLennan at an unnamed area in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland . The pot appears to have been at least a hundred years old when it was first buried in the mid-Ninth or Tenth centuries. Mr McLennan said: 'We still don't know exactly what is in the pot, but I hope it could reveal who these artefacts belonged to, or at least where they came from.' He made the discovery in early September while out with two local ministers who are also keen detectorists, Rev Dr David Bartholomew, a Church of Scotland minister of a rural Galloway charge, and Mike Smith, the pastor of an Elim Pentecostal Church in Galloway. Rev Dr Bartholomew said: 'We were searching elsewhere when Derek initially thought he'd discovered a Viking gaming piece. 'A short time later he ran over to us waving a silver arm-ring and shouting 'Viking'. 'It was tremendously exciting, especially when we noticed the silver cross lying face-downwards. 'It was poking out from under the pile of silver ingots and decorated arm-rings, with a finely wound silver chain still attached to it. An archaeologist prepares the top level  hoard for removal. The historically significant find was made by Derek McLennan, a committed metal detector enthusiast who has been searching around the area in Dumfries and Galloway for the last year . 'It was a heart-stopping moment when the local archaeologist turned it over to reveal rich decoration on the other side.' Mr McLennan is no stranger to finding treasure, having been part of a group which discovered more than 300 medieval silver coins shortly before Christmas last year. Scotland's Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop said of the latest find: 'The Vikings were well known for having raided these shores in the past, but today we can appreciate what they have left behind, with this wonderful addition to Scotland's cultural heritage. 'It's clear that these artefacts are of great value in themselves, but their greatest value will be in what they can contribute to our understanding of life in early medieval Scotland, and what they tell us about the interaction between the different peoples in these islands at that time. 'The Dumfries hoard opens a fascinating window on a formative period in the story of Scotland and just goes to show how important our archaeological heritage in Scotland continues to be.' Under Scots common law for rediscovered relics the hoard is currently in the care of the Treasure Trove Unit. Treasure hunter Derek McLennan who spent a year searching the unidentified location in Dumfries and Galloway before stumbling on the treasure trove in September . An agreement between the landowners - the Church of Scotland General Trustees – and Mr McLennan - has been reached for an appropriate finder's fee. Secretary to the General Trustees, David Robertson, said: 'We are very excited to have been part of such an historic find and we commend Derek for the spirit in which he has worked with us and the other agencies involved in making sure everything is properly registered and accounted for. 'Any money arising from this will first and foremost be used for the good of the local parish. We recognise Derek is very responsible in pursuing his interest, but we do not encourage metal detecting on Church land unless detailed arrangements have been agreed beforehand with the General Trustees.' The exact location of the find is being kept secret, and the Scottish Government, Treasure Trove Unit, and Historic Scotland are all working to preserve the site while its full significance is being determined. Experts at the unit described the find as 'one of the most significant Viking hoards ever discovered in Scotland'. Stuart Campbell, the head of the Treasure Trove Unit, who is overseeing assessment of the hoard, said: 'This is a very important and significant find and has required the close cooperation of Historic Scotland with Treasure Trove Unit and National Museums Scotland staff to recover the fascinating items it contains. 'Due to the quantity and variety of the objects, and the importance of the find overall, it will take some time for experts to assess the hoard as a whole so that we can appreciate its true significance. We look forward to learning more.' All the objects will now undergo extensive conservation work in order to determine more about their individual historical significance.","Location searched by enthusiast Derek McLennan for a year without success .

"NYPD chokehold victim Eric Garner's daughter has called out civil rights leader Rev Al Sharpton for being obsessed with financial gain, according to a new undercover video released Monday. Erica Snipes, the daughter of Eric Garner who died in Staten Island last July after a New York City Police officer put him in a chokehold, aired her complaints about Rev Sharpton, the founder of the National Action Network, during a secretly recorded conversation with two conservative activists. The undercover video was released online Monday by right-wing filmmaker James O'Keefe's group, Project Veritas. Scroll down for video . Heart-to-heart: Erica Snipes, 24, told undercover investigators with James O'Keefe's right-wig group Project Veritas last month that Rev Al Sharpton was 'all about money' Harsh words: Snipes accused Cynthia Davis, director of the National Action Networks' Staten Island branch of lashing out at her for handing out fliers about the Garner case that did not feature the NAN logo . Snipes said because Sharpton's organization paid for her father's funeral (pictured), they were now trying to make it seem as if she owed them something . The nearly 8-minute-long video also includes interviews with other African-American community leaders and activities, most of whom had something negative to say about Rev Sharpton. O'Keefe's group caught up with Miss Snipes in January at a protest held at the St George Ferry Terminal in Staten Island. 'You think Al Sharpton is kind of like a crook in a sense?' one of the undercover investigators posing as an Eric Garner supporter asked Erica Snipes. 'He's about this,' Snipes replied rubbing her thumb and index finger together in a universal sign symbolizing money. 'He's about money with you?' the Project Veritas staffer asked, to which Snipes, 24, replied in the affirmative. Walk-back: Snipes, 24, has since denied she had claimed that Rev Sharpton was greedy . Sharpton, pictured outside of the Bethel Baptist Church before the funeral for Eric Garner on July 23, 2014, accused Project Veritas of exploiting Erica Snipes . Eric Garner's eldest daughter then went on to criticize Cynthia Davis, director of the National Action Networks' Staten Island branch, claiming that Sharpton’s henchwoman once lashed out at her for handing out fliers about the Garner case that did not feature the NAN logo. 'Instead of me, he wants his face in front,' Snipes said in the video, referring to Sharpton. She then added that because Sharpton's organization covered her father's funeral expenses in July, they were now trying to make it seem as if Snipes was indebted to them. On Monday night, Ms Snipes denied in an interview with the New York Post that she had claimed Al Sharpton was grasping, but she did not back away from her criticism of Cynthia Davis, . On his part, Rev Sharpton, 60, accused James O'Keefe's conservative group of 'exploiting' Eric Garner's daughter, whom he described as a 'sincere victim.’ ‘They’re splicing and dicing stuff together,’ he said. ‘It was a distortion.’ Mr Sharpton insisted that his organization, which is dedicated to helping small businesses and low-income families, does not take money from them. The 60-year-old MSNBC talk show host also addressed the logo kerfuffle, explaining that NAN secures permits for rallies, and therefore requires that its symbol be featured on materials promoting events it sponsors. Bishop Calvin Scott, of Believers Temple in Ferguson, Missouri, accused Sharpton of inciting protesters . Darryl Parks, an attorney linked to the Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown cases, conceded that 'there may be little truth to that', when asked if Sharpton was 'all about the money' Sharpton, pictured speaking at the funeral service for Eric Garner, dismissed the undercover video as a'distortion' The Project Vertias moles also got an earful about Rev Sharpton's perceived shortcomings from activists involved in the Michael Brown shooting in Missouri and Trayvon Martin's killing in Florida. 'To some degree, he sort of incites people for the wrong reason,' Bishop Calvin Scott, of Believers Temple in Ferguson, Missouri, said in the video. Darryl Parks, an attorney linked to the Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown cases, conceded that 'there may be little truth to that', when asked if Sharpton was 'all about the money.' On Monday night, Parks said his comments were taken out of context and insisted that he supports Sharpton. Jean Petrus, a donor to the Trayvon Martin Foundation, sounded a similar note Monday, claiming that he was caught in an 'entrapment situation' when asked about Sharpton during a recent fundraiser. In the undercover footage, Mr Petrus said of the civil rights leader: 'He knows how to make money and get money... They’re shakedown guys to me.'","Erica Snipes, 24, told undercover investigators with James O'Keefe's right-wing group Project Veritas that Sharpton was all about money .

"Bombshell details of salacious messages sent by a top Tory official on a gay dating service, referring to a sex party funded by Conservative MPs’ expenses, were revealed last night. Messages the official exchanged with another man on Grindr, a gay dating app, refer to ‘cute boys’, ‘orgy’, ‘gay party’, ‘hottie MPs’ and ‘all in one bed’ said to be ‘on offer’ in a luxury hotel suite hired for Tory researchers at the party’s annual conference in Manchester. The messages name two top Tory MPs: one of the most senior Government Ministers and an MP tipped as a future Party leader. Partying: Details of salacious messages sent by a top Tory official on a gay dating service were revealed last week. The exchanges involved Tory official Iain Corby (pictured, left, with an unidentified man) The Mail on Sunday can reveal that the exchanges involved Tory official Iain Corby and were one of the reasons he suddenly quit as head of the Westminster-based Parliamentary Resources Unit (PRU), which is paid for  by MPs via taxpayer-funded expenses. Insiders say there was near panic at 10 Downing Street when the Grindr messages were reported to David Cameron last month. Connected: Mr Corby sent the messages to another man via Grindr. Above, the official's profile . He ordered an urgent investigation, which led to Mr Corby’s departure in an attempt to limit the damage. The shocking disclosures came as: . It adds to a fevered atmosphere at Westminster, with wild, and for the most part, anonymous, claims that young gay researchers are bullied – or even drugged – into accepting sexual advances from MPs and other senior political  figures under the threat of missing out on political careers. The ‘sex party’ on MPs’ expenses at Manchester’s Light ApartHotel, where rooms cost up to £2,500 a night, was first revealed by The Mail on Sunday last week. At that stage, this newspaper faced legal restrictions over the amount of detail that could be reported. Today we can reveal full details of the Tory PRU chief at the centre of the row – and of how claims that the PRU scandal was covered up for years forced No 10 to act. The body responsible for MPs’ expenses and pay, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA), is now investigating the hotel ‘sex party’. Revealed: The exchanges involved Tory official Iain Corby and were one of the reasons he suddenly quit as head of the Westminster-based Parliamentary Resources Unit (PRU), which is paid for by MPs via taxpayer-funded expenses . An IPSA source expressed ‘deep worry’ at the allegations. IPSA has good reason to be concerned: the event was funded by money claimed from it by MPs. Furthermore, it could have been a breach of IPSA rules to pay for the PRU accommodation at the Light ApartHotel, regardless of what went on there. IPSA rules state ‘staffing expenditure may not be claimed for any party political activity.’ Nor can MPs claim expenses for ‘attendance at political party conferences’. Scene: The comments refer to a luxury hotel suite at Manchester's Light ApartHotel (pictured), where rooms cost up to £2,500 a night. It was hired for Tory researchers at the party's annual conference in Manchester . Revealed: The 'sex party' on MPs' expenses at the hotel was first revealed by The Mail on Sunday last week . The PRU is a team of 20, mainly young . male and female researchers, whose job is to advise Tory MPs on all . political issues, from climate change to potholes. Each Tory MP pays the PRU £4,000 a year for research services. The MPs claim it back from IPSA as an expense. One researcher, Anthony Pickles, quit after a year working at the PRU, dismayed by its ‘drinking culture’. ‘Anthony flagged up his concerns very . clearly but nothing was done,’ said a source. ‘He was appalled at the . way people went out drinking.He did his best to draw it to the attention . of the authorities.’ Speaking out: The shocking disclosures came as ex-Commons Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans (right) called for action to stop public figures being subjected to a 'witch-hunt', while former Minister Michael Fabricant (left) revealed he reported Mr Corby to party chiefs  after being approached by PRU whistleblowers three years ago . Mr Pickles is now Chief of Staff of the Welsh Conservative Party. To avoid blame for the PRU fiasco, Ministers were quick to point out last night that technically, the unit is not part of the Conservative Party. It operates in Parliament and is answerable to a board of Tory MPs. Senior Tory MP Oliver Heald, former chairman of the PRU, held an inquiry two years ago into the ‘sex party’ claims at the 2011 Tory conference in Manchester, and the allegation that Mr Corby was rude after returning to work under the influence of alcohol. Mr Corby was given a formal warning. Casual: The photo of Iain Corby in an open-necked shirt portrays a man at play, not at work . The message – accompanied by a ‘selfie’ – posted by Parliamentary Resources Unit (PRU) chief Iain Corby on gay dating app Grindr at the Tory conference in Manchester in 2011 seemed clear. The photo of Corby in a casual, open-necked shirt, portrayed a man at play, not at work. ‘Open to offers!’ it announced. It appeared to be an open invitation to anyone else logged on to Grindr nearby to join him at his three-bedroom suite at the Light ApartHotel. Helpfully, it gave details of Corby’s location and personal information: ‘The light hotel, 35 years old, 173cm, white.’ It even gave the hotel’s address, ‘20 Church St’. There was only one problem: Corby and . his PRU team are employed to advise Tory MPs on party policy and were . there funded by taxpayers, via MPs’ expenses. A very different type of ‘party’ features on Corby’s Grindr messages: a ‘gay party’. Tory . chiefs were well aware of Corby’s Grindr exchanges and his . taxpayer-funded stay with a group of PRU aides at the Light ApartHotel. They . were alarmed by references to two well-known and powerful Tory MPs with . close Downing Street links. Neither attended any sex party – or went to . the Light ApartHotel. The Mail on Sunday has redacted all names in the . Grindr messages. When the . Grindr claims were followed by allegations of a ‘heavy drinking culture’ in the PRU and unsubstantiated claims concerning gay sex and young male . aides, Tory chiefs launched an official investigation after a . complaint. Corby was given a warning. Party chiefs congratulated themselves that a potential scandal had been swept under the carpet. But . it has come back to haunt them after word swept Westminster last month . of a new Tory scandal involving the PRU. Two weeks ago, Corby resigned. The official reason was he wanted to ‘return to the commercial world’. Gay dating app: The message - accompanied by a 'selfie' - posted by Mr  Corby on gay dating app Grindr gave details of Corby's location and personal information: 'The light hotel, 35 years old, 173cm, white' (file picture) Last week, The Mail on Sunday revealed the Grindr row – and this week we disclose full details. Corby’s Grindr messages in Manchester start just before midday: ‘Enjoying the penthouse.’ It has the desired effect, soon afterwards, another Grindr user, who is not named, replies: ‘Penthouse? I’m only in standard.’ ‘Yep. Top 2 floors. Quite nice!’ Corby replies. The exchanges soon get more intimate. ‘Sharing with two colleagues but I chose the cutest boys from my team!’ says Corby, teasingly. ‘All in one bed!’ comes the excited reply. The steamy theme continues with a suggestion that a married Tory has cheated on his wife with a ‘girl’ in one room; references to ‘orgy!’ ‘your fit housemate’ and a named man who ‘did come to  the gay party’. Corby’s anonymous respondent then quips: ‘Sleep to the top!’ It is at this point that the first senior Tory is referred to, apparently as a joke. Corby replies with mock outrage: ‘Oh please.  I don’t need to sleep with MPs.’ His Grindr ‘playmate’ takes issue with him, stating some younger MPs are ‘hotties’, naming one whom he says he ‘likes’. He continues: ‘How about a trip up to your room later?’ Corby replies: ‘XXXXXX is just out of the shower walking around naked. He knows how to keep his boss happy even if he claims to be straight.’ Back comes the reply: ‘He wants a pay rise! Am I competing with him?’ It is not known what happened after the exchanges. One member of the PRU who visited the Light ApartHotel during the 2011 Tory conference told The Mail on Sunday. ‘I didn’t see any sex parties when I was at the hotel, but rumours of wild goings on there were the talk of the conference.’ Mr Corby was unavailable for comment.","Details of salacious messages sent by Iain Corby were revealed last night .

"A former child actress who played Mel Gibson's young daughter in the 2000 film The Patriot died July 19 in part as a result of huffing, Texas Authorities revealed Monday. Tests reveal 21-year-old actress Skye McCole Bartusiak had muscle relaxers, painkillers and a chemical refrigerant difluoroethane in her system at the time of her death, reports TMZ. Her death has been ruled an accidental overdose likely caused by the mixture of Vicodin, the muscle relaxant carisoprodol and the refrigerant often abused as an inhalant. Accidental overdose: Tests reveal 21-year-old actress Skye McCole Bartusiak had muscle relaxers, painkillers and a chemical refrigerant difluoroethane in her system at the time of her death . Bartusiak was best known for her role in Gibson's Revolutionary War epic The Patriot, where she played the daughter of militia leader Benjamin Martin who struggles to speak with her father. Bartusiak's mother, Helen Bartusiak, told The Associated Press the actress had been living in a garage apartment at her parents' Houston home. She said the actress' boyfriend found her there unresponsive on her bed. Helen Bartusiak said she tried to resuscitate her daughter but could not. She said at the time that the actress had been healthy and did not drink or do drugs. 'We think she had a seizure and choked and nobody was there,' Bartusiak told CNN shortly after her daughter's death. Child actress: Bartusiak was best known for her role in Mel Gibson's Revolutionary War epic The Patriot, where she played the daughter of militia leader Benjamin Martin who struggles to speak with her father . Difluoroethane is a chemical found in products such as canned 'Duster' type sprays. According to the New Jersey Department of Health, it is 'colorless and odorless gas used as a liquefied compressed gas. It is used as a cooling agent, as an aerosol propellant and in the manufacture of other chemicals.' Difluoroethane is sometimes abused for its 'euphoric' effects, but has been known to cause accidental death in those who inhale it. It is also flammable and a known cancer-causing agent. Her mother said: . 'We lost our girl,She was a kind and really beautiful girl.' Bartusiak made her acting debut in the television miniseries Storm of the Century in 1999 and also had a role on 24 in 2002-2003. She made her film debut in the The Cider House Rules in 1999 and starred with Michael Douglas in Don't Say a Word in 2001. Her most recent move was Sick Boy in 2012. The Patriot cast also included Heath Ledger, who died after an accidental overdose of painkillers and sedatives in 2008.

"Shoppers will boycott milk from farms in areas where badgers are being shot to stop the spread of TB among cattle, the RSPCA has predicted. The charity said that while it is not calling for a boycott, consumers will vote with their feet. Those opposed to planned cull of badgers in Gloucestershire and Somerset may also choose not to holiday there. Badger boycott: The RSPCA is predicting that shoppers will boycott milk from farms in areas where badgers are shot to stop the spread of TB among cattle . Gavin Grant, the RSPCA’s chief executive, said: ‘Those who care will not want to visit areas or buy milk from farms soaked in badgers’ blood.’ Mr Grant said that supermarkets should label milk produced from areas outside the cull zone as being ‘badger friendly’, in the same way as some cans of tuna are marked out as being ‘dolphin friendly’. RSPCA spokesman David Bowles said: ‘What we would like to see is people being given a choice when they go into their supermarket, whether to buy milk from a badger cull area or not. ‘It’s a very simple consumer choice issue, it’s not about a boycott.’ However, the National Farmers Union has warned that labelling would not be simple and says that if the spread of bovine TB is not stemmed, customers will ultimately end up paying more for their milk. Culling row: RSPCA spokesman David Bowles, left, said that people should know whether the milk they buy is from a badger cull area but National Farmers Union president Peter Kendall, right, says it is sending 'a really dangerous message' NFU president Peter Kendall told . BBC2’s Newsnight that to try and bankrupt farmers and put them out of . business is ‘a really dangerous message’. Bovine . TB, which can be spread by badgers, leads to up to 30,000 cattle being . slaughtered a year, at a cost to the dairy industry of around . £90million. The row over the best way to control it has been inflamed by the Government giving the go head for trained marksmen to shoot up to 70 per cent of the badgers on 300 farms in West Gloucestershire over the next four years. Approval for a similar scheme in Somerset is expected later this week. Fosters disease: Critics say that some studies have shown that culling badgers can actually foster the spread of the disease . The NFU says that with the number of cases of bovine TV ‘exploding’ in recent years, a cull is the only option. Shadow environment secretary Mary Creagh says there is widespread concern about the decision to continue the cull . But critics favour other methods, . including vaccination. They accuse the government of making a decision . based on politics rather than science and say that studies have shown . that culling badgers can actually foster the spread of the disease, . rather than slow it. This may be because disturbing a badger population causes survivors to roam further afield, taking the disease with them. A petition to halt the cull has gathered more than 100,000 signatures, meaning the issue could be debated in parliament. More extreme animal welfare groups are planning other methods of protest including sabotaging culls and vandalising supermarket cash machines. Shadow environment secretary Mary Creagh said: ‘There is widespread concern about the Government’s decision to press ahead with a badger cull despite their own official advice that it will cost more than it saves and will spread bovine TB in the short term as badgers are disturbed by the shooting. ‘Ministers should listen to the scientists and can this cull which is bad for farmers, bad for taxpayers and bad for wildlife.’","The RSPCA believes that shoppers should know if milk has been produced at a farm in a badger cull area .

"Mexican troops have replaced policemen in half of a large state that borders Texas, in the deep south, because there were fears that the officers were corrupt and helping the drug cartels. Some 2,800 heavily armed soldiers were deployed in 22 of Tamaulipas's 43 cities over the weekend - this was done, in part, as President Felipe Calderon moved to defend his drug war strategy. As the streets of Mexico become increasingly bloodstained, the 48-year-old, who began his fierce crackdown on drug trafficking - which, according to the U.S. Department of Justice, earns up to $48.4 billion a year - in 2006, faces strong criticism from activists. Armed to the teeth: Some 2,800 Mexican soldiers have been deployed to Tamaulipas, which borders Texas . You're nicked: A suspected memeber of the Michoacan cartel is taken away by Mexican anti-drug soldiers . Close to the border: Tamaulipas neighbours Texas . For decades the Mexican government employed a passive attitude to the cartels, but that changed in December 2006 when the newly appointed Mr Calderon sent 6,500 troops to Michoacan to end the violence there. The war against drugs has escalated and now there are over 45,000 troops involved, with the president justifying the increase in troops because - as he said last year - the cartels seek 'to replace the government' and 'are trying to impose a monopoly by force of arms, and are even trying to impose their own laws'. On the offensive: Felipe Calderon started his crackdown on the drug cartels weeks after taking charge of Mexico in December 2006 . The cost has been heavy, both financially and in terms of life - across Mexico, since Mr Calderon began his crackdown, there have been some 38,000 . drug-related deaths, according to official figures. On the ground, the men in imposing, heavy black uniform, helmets and armed to the teeth, took to the streets in the state's largest cities, including the capital, Ciudad Victoria, and the border cities of Nuevo Laredo, Reynosa and Matamoros. Mexico's Ministry of Defence insisted 'the support is of temporary and extraordinary character' but an official in Nuevo Laredo, who wished to remain anonymous, told CNN that local police have been replaced while they are investigated for corruption. Police on the take are one of the biggest hurdles for Mr Calderon and his soldiers have to eradicate in order to best combat the drug cartels - in the past purges of police departments have been carried out, but the unnamed official said he had 'never seen such a large operation and so many soldiers here'. According to the Ministry of Defence the local government of Tamaulipas had requested the assistance from the Mexican government. Heavy duty: The soldiers have been moved in as the police were feared corrupt and helping the drug cartels . Activists: People are shown on the streets in Mexico City in May to protest against the president's obsession with breaking the cartels . Troops were moved in to San Fernando, too, where authorities discovered mass graves containing more than 200 corpses earlier this year, while investigating the kidnapping of passengers from a bus. And last year the bodies of 72 migrants from Central and South America were found at a nearby ranch. Peaceful: Poet turned activist Javier Sicilia lost his son to the drug violence and urged President Calderon to halt his offensive . A drug cartel called The Zetas were blamed for the mass graves and for the deaths of the migrants. In addition, Ciudad Mier - which almost became a ghost town last year following wave of violence followed the assassination of a Gulf cartel leader - will also see troops move in. The replacement of the police comes only days after Mexican poet and activist Javier Sicilia, leader of the Movement for Peace with Justice and Dignity, discussed scaling down the offensive with Mr Calderon.Mr Sicilia, 56, lost his son in the drug wars and Mr Calderon apologised to the families of the victims of the violence, but defended himself at the meeting. Later, he took to his Twitter account and wrote: 'They say that everything is the government's fault for sending the army to combat the criminals. 'That premise is wrong. There is not violence because there are federal forces in place. It is the opposite: the federal forces are there because there is violence. 'To reconstruct institutions, we have to purge and strengthen police, prosecutors, judges, in all of the states and at the federal level.'","President has been fighting drug war since 2006 .

"Athletes and spectators from Britain will be the target of ‘Russia’s Osama Bin Laden’ at next month’s Winter Olympics, a secret intelligence report warns. The document, drawn up by Canadian counterterrorism agencies and shared with British intelligence, says Doku Umarov poses the greatest terror threat for the Games at Sochi in southern Russia. Umarov, 49, is the Chechen jihadist leader blamed for the two suicide bombings in Volgograd in Russia over Christmas. A document, drawn up by Canadian counterterrorism agencies and shared with British intelligence, says Doku Umarov poses the greatest terror threat for the Games at Sochi in southern Russia . The warlord leads Imarat Kavkaz (IK) – an armed group fighting to impose Islamic rule in Russia’s North Caucasus, the mountainous region that borders Sochi. The heavily-redacted report, compiled by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service and seen by The Mail on Sunday, says Umarov has called for attacks on what he calls the ‘satanic games’. The report warns: ‘Doku Khamaiovich Umarov is a fervent Islamist who espouses AQ’s [Al Qaeda’s] ideology of global jihad. ‘His view that Israeli, US and UK interests  are legitimate targets raises concerns that  any Westerners could  be targeted.’ It adds: ‘Umarov appears to have consolidated his leadership but questions remain over the extent cells will follow his lead – especially as some IK commanders eliminated by Russian counter terrorism efforts are being replaced by younger, less experienced fighters.’ Umarov, 49, is the Chechen jihadist leader blamed for the two suicide bombings in Volgograd in Russia over Christmas .

"US Airways has sparked outrage after a flight attendant allegedly refused to hang up an Army Ranger and combat veteran's jacket to stop it from creasing. First Sergeant Albert Marle was wearing a jacket lined with medals when he boarded Flight 1930 from Portland, Oregon, to Charlotte, North Carolina, yesterday. But when he asked an attendant to hang up his 'Dress Blues' uniform, she reportedly refused, saying the coat closet was for first-class passengers only and he was seated in coach. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Army Ranger and combat veteran: First Sergeant Albert Marle (pictured before his flight yesterday) was wearing this jacket lined with medals when he boarded Flight 1930 from Portland, Oregon, to Charlotte, North Carolina . 'Her response wasn't that there's not space in the coat closet or ""I've hung too many jackets up"",' said Brian Kirby, a first-class passenger on the four-hour flight. 'It was just simply,""Our airline policy says I'm not going to do it, so I'm not going to do it."" I was really appalled at not only the way she looked at him but the way she spoke to him - in an angry way.' Shocked first-class fliers then offered their seats to Sgt Marle, but the decorated soldier politely declined their offers and remained seated in coach, passengers told WSOC TV in Charlotte. Some even claimed the flight attendant shouted at fliers who tried to ask other attendants to hang up Sgt Marle's decorated jacket to prevent it from wrinkling. Under fire: When Sgt Marle  asked a US Airways attendant to hang up his 'Dress Blues' uniform, she reportedly refused, saying the that closet was for first-class passengers only and he was seated in coach (file image) 'Humble': Numerous first-class fliers offered their seats to Sgt Marle, but the decorated soldier politely declined their offers and remained seated in coach. Above, the soldier was wearing his uniform to job interviews . Outrage: After passengers spread word of the incident online, it quickly went viral, with thousands of social media users (including Brian Kirby, above) condemning the airline's 'shameful' behavior toward Sgt Marle . Amid the chaos, passenger Jon Dahlberg took it upon himself to take the item of clothing from 'humble' Sgt Marle, before hanging it behind his own seat, according to reports. 'I walked back up and hung the jacket simply behind my seat. There’s a difference between policy and doing what is right,' said Mr Dahlberg. After passengers spread word of the incident online, it quickly went viral, with thousands of social media users condemning the airline for its 'shameful' behavior toward Sgt Marle. Mr Kirby took to Twitter to express his disgust, writing: 'Do not fly US Air, I have just witnessed a US soldier heavily decorated disgraced. Will be sharing with other media outlets ASAP.' Angered: Addressing US Airways, Mr Kirby, also a passenger on the flight, tweeted: According to my flight attendant you have a policy to not hang the dress coats of Army Rangers not seated in first class #antiusair' Questioning the policy: Meanwhile, Mr Kirby's wife, Laura, tweeted the airline directly, saying: '@USAirways is it really in your policy to disrespect brave men such as Sergeant Marle?' Passengers: Mr and Mrs Kirby (pictured speaking to WSOC TV Channel 9 yesterday) said of the flight attendant: 'Her response was just simply,""Our airline policy says I'm not going to do it, so I'm not going to do it""' Meanwhile, his wife, Laura Kirby, tweeted the airline directly, saying: '@USAirways is it really in your policy to disrespect brave men such as Sergeant Marle?' And Twitter user Hays Parks said: 'You don't respect military personnel. You owe that Army Ranger an apology, not excuses.' Cliff Authrey, who was also a passenger on Flight 1930, even claimed he was considering switching to a frequent flyer club of another airline following the incident. Response: U.S. Airways tweeted Mrs Kirby back saying: 'We have great respect for our Military personnel' Hitting out: But Twitter user Hays Parks said: 'You don't respect military personnel' You owe [him] an apology' However, others pointed out that Sgt Marle should not be entitled to special treatment simply because of his job. At the time of the incident, a U.S. Airways spokesman reportedly said Sgt Marle's request was declined because he was the fourth person to ask and the closet did not have any space. However, this afternoon, the airline issued an apology for the flight attendant's alleged response, saying it was reviewing the incident internally and wanted to thank Sgt Marle for his service. Army base: According to officials at Fort Bragg (pictured), the medals of Sgt Marle's jacket show he is qualified in the fields of Ranger, Pathfinder, Air Assault, Special Forces and is likely serving in an airborne unit . A spokesman said: 'We have a long and proud history of serving our military members and hold the men and women who serve our country in the highest regard.' According to officials at Fort Bragg, the medals of Sgt Marle's jacket show he is qualified in the fields of Ranger, Pathfinder, Air Assault, Special Forces and is likely currently serving in an airborne unit. He has  been wearing the uniform on job interviews across the country while pursuing his dream to become a doctor, his family told Channel 9. They refused to comment further.","First Sergeant Albert Marle boarded plane wearing a jacket lined with medals .

"U.S. District Court Judge Esther Salas has sentenced Teresa Giudice to 15 months in federal prison and husband Joe Giudice to 41 months, while also ordering both to individually pay $414,588 in restitution. The couple will also serve two years of probation upon being released, almost the maximum sentence that could have been handed down after they pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and three types of bankruptcy fraud earlier this year. Teresa broke down in tears before her sentencing saying, 'I am more sorry than anyone will ever know,' adding to the judge, 'I will make this right.' Scroll down for video . Avoiding the press: Teresa Giudice (above, with husband Joe leaving the courtroom) was sentenced to 15 months in federal prison by a judge today, and broke down in tears as she was sentenced . Going away: Joe, who was sentenced to 41 months in federal prison and ordered to pay restitution of $414,588, gripped his wife's hand as they left the courthouse . Family: The Giudices have four daughters, Gia (above in purple), Gabriella (above in orange), Milania (above in blue) and Audriana (above in white) Hiding: The two quickly rushed from the courtroom to their car after being sentenced . 'I need to send a message. In the eyes of the law it doesn't matter who you are. There are consequences to pay,' the judge told Teresa as she handed out her sentence. 'Confinement is absolutely necessary in this case,' Salas added, after admitting she did briefly consider probation for the reality star. 'I don’t honestly believe you respect the law.' Teresa, 42, will report to prison on January 5, while Joe will report to prison after his wife serves her sentence so one of them can be with their four children while the other is away. 'She thumbed her nose at the court, now she wants sympathy,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan W. Romankow told the judge earlier in the day according to Jack Barbosa, who was in the courtroom. Romankow then recommended she receive 21 months in prison for her crimes. Keeping watch: the couple was flanked by security guards as they left the courthouse . Frenzy: The couple were surrounded by media as they took off in their white Mercedes Benz GL450 (above) Joe, 43, also pleaded guilty to failing to file a tax return for 2004, though he acknowledged he didn't file taxes on income of approximately $1 million between 2004 and 2008. He will serve 12 months on that charge, but it will run concurrently with the 41 months he had already received for his other crimes. With good behavior, Teresa could be out in 12 months. Paul Fishman, the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, said the sentencing was 'fair, appropriate and reasonable.' No special treatment: The attorneys for both were unsuccessful in getting the judge to be lenient on the couple . The look: Her blouse was uncharacteristically conservative, but her eyelashes were their usual camera-ready selves . Under fire: Judge Esther Salas yelled at the couple early in the day for omissions in their financial disclosure forms . The judge said that immigration services will not act on Joe's deportation case until after he serves time. Joe's attorneys have said that he came to the U.S. as an infant from Italy and wasn't aware that he wasn't an American citizen. According to Radar Online, Joe's lawyers have told him he should start preparing to be deported to Italy after he serves time. The judge also recommended that he participate in an alcohol program, this after Joe's lawyer, Miles Feinstein, said Joe had a drinking problem and should be sent to rehab rather than prison. Feinstein even told the judge that Joe shows up to his office 'smelling of booze.' Joe also spent time in court trying to exonerate his wife from these charges, something his lawyer called 'the mark of a real man.' His lawyer then tried to place all blame on his client once his sentence had been handed down, and say Teresa should be kept out of jail for their girls, delaying her sentencing by hours. Large crowd: The couple was surrounded by attorneys and others to get through the crowd as they entered court this morning . Keeping the peace: Barricades were set up to the courthouse steps, leaving a path for the Giudices to enter the courthouse for their 10 am sentencing . Earlier, Judge Salas had yelled at the couple for failing to let the court know they purchased 'recreational vehicles, home furnishings, cars, construction equipment' and more over the past few months. 'How is it that at this point the court is having to go over this?' Salas asked the couple's defense attorneys, according to The Record. The couple apparently had no answer for the judge, claiming they had hired an accountant and provided that person with their financial information. The judge also pointed out the couple had previously hid assets from the court, forcing her to put off their sentencing. 'It's the same pattern of obstruction and dishonesty and manipulation that they showed in the bankruptcy case,' the prosecutor told Judge Salas. The couple also said on forms they only own $25,000 worth of furniture in their $3 million home, saying the production company furnishes the house for them during filming. The judge then asked why, if this was the case, they had a $1 million insurance policy. She also reminded the two that in 2009 bankruptcy filings, the couple showed $60,000 in assets in their home. McMansion: The couple claims they only have $25,000 worth of furniture in their $3 million mansion (above), and that the production crew provides furnishings when they film . Conflicting report: In their 2009 bankruptcy filing however, the Giudices claimed $60,000 worth of furniture in their mansion (above) 'They had an obligation to be transparent and candid and open with the court and I don't think I got that,' Judge Salas said according to NJ.com. 'I want to understand the disconnect.' Teresa also listed her jewelry amount as 0, saying most is costume jewelry and not worth much. According to a reporter from the Star-Ledger in the courtroom, the judge then said that 'the pattern of omissions and inconsistencies does not make the couple seem worthy of leniency.' Joe's lawyer blamed these recent actions on his client's difficulty dealing with the death of his father this past June. 'He hasn't been the same person,' Feinstein said. 'That was his best friend.' Cheap baubles: Teresa filed a 0 for the worth of her jewelry on court documents . Precious gems: A photo of Teresa's hand from an event in September of 2013 seems to show she does have some very nice jewelry . Joe read a letter to the court before he was sentenced, saying, 'I stand here humiliated before the court and my family and society. I disgraced many people, including my wife and four daughters. I take full responsibility for my actions. I promise to be a better person.' The couple took a plea deal in March, admitting that they hid assets from bankruptcy creditors and submitted phony loan applications to get some $5 million in mortgages and construction loans. The couple also got some bad news earlier this week when a bankruptcy judge denied their claim to erase over $13 million in debt. The couple arrived for the 10 am hearing at little after 9 this morning, Teresa dressing very conservatively in a black suit and yellow oxford shirt. Recent actions: Joe's lawyer blamed his client's financial omissions on his emotional state after losing his father (seen above with Joe's oldest daughter Gia) Reality star: Teresa has been featured on all six seasons of Real Housewives of New Jersey . The good news however is that the couple's daughters, Gia, Gabriella, Milania and Audriana,will not be without a parent as each serves their time. 'My four daughters are my life. I don't care about the TV show,' Teresa had told the judge in court today. Neither Teresa, Joe or their attorneys have commented yet on today's events. A spokeswoman for NBCUniversal, which owns Bravo, the channel that airs Real Housewives, said that the network wasn't commenting on the Giudices' position with the show.","U.S. District Court Judge Esther Salas has sentenced Teresa Giudice to 15 months in prison and ordered her to pay restitution of $414,588 .
Joe Giudice will serve 41 months in federal prison and has also been ordered  to pay restitution of $414,588 .
Italian-born Joe will not find out if he will be deported until after he serves time, and the judge urged him to participate in an alcohol program .
Teresa broke down in tears addressing the judge, saying 'I am more sorry than anyone will ever know'
Teresa will report to prison on January 5, and Joe will report after Teresa serves her sentence so someone can be with their children .

The judge yelled at the couple in court today for omitting on financial forms they had purchased new cars, furniture and construction equipment over the past few months .
The judge then said these actions do not make the couple seem 'worthy of leniency,' and brought up the possibility of charging them with perjury .
Joe's lawyer blamed these recent actions on the difficulty his client has been having emotionally since the death of his father this past June ."
"Halloween came early for New Yorkers as Banksy unveiled his latest piece in the final few days of a month-long exhibition. The installation launched at 7pm last night features a grim reaper carting around manically on a bumper car. Police arrived to the scene at the corner of Houston and Elizabeth Streets but did not break up the large crowds that gathered. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Art: A Grim Reaper figure, riding a bumper car, is the newest art installation by Banksy in New York . Excitement: Crowds build around the  piece that launched at dusk last night on Houston and Elizabeth Streets . The spooky figure looks ecstatic zooming along to Blue Öyster Cult's 'Don't Fear the Reaper'. The installation is narrated by an audio guide with a lisping voice speaking over an accordion: 'Welcome to the fair, which life isn't. 'This sculpture perfectly represents death in that—it's a bit random. 'It often said that the role of art is to remind us of our mortality. Watch the installation: . New York mayor Michael Bloomberg said: 'It's a sign of decay and loss of control' and said graffiti ruins property . Better Out Than In: The month-long exhibition is coming to an end but New Yorkers have high expectations . Halloween: The Lower East Side piece will stay up until Sunday as the city gets ready to celebrate Halloween . Banksy started his career on Bristol's underground street art scene in the early 1990s. He used some stencils but did a lot of freehand work too - and started officially specialising in stencils in 2000. By the mid-90s, his humourous and cutting pieces were popping up in London. Becoming highly sought after pieces of art, his work was soon being auctioned off by art houses, who would leave the question of its removal to the bidder. Now a typical artist name for coffee table books, he has still managed to maintain his anonymity. Rumours circulate about his background, but the widely accepted story is that he was born and raised in Bristol, the son of a technician, and trained as a butcher. He has now done pieces worldwide - from New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina to a fully-fledged gallery exhibition in his home town. 'Banksy's take on that seems to be mounting an art show that goes on for so long, we all wish we were dead already.' It follows the appearance of a graffiti of a man in a tuxedo solemnly holding a bunch of drooping flowers - as though he's just been stood up - on the side of a strip club on 51st Street. The Hustler Club owners quickly enlisted the help of their security guard Jesse Wright to protect the piece while they determine how best to preserve it. According to the Gothamist, Wright has been letting Banksy fans pose with the piece 'if (they) ask him nicely.' Today, is the 24th day of the British street artist's month-long open-air residency in New York City, Better Out Than In. There are only 7 days left. The Hustler Club's New York Marketing Director, Steve Karel, told Gothamist this afternoon: 'We're honored that Banksy chose the Larry Flynt's Hustler Club New York to share his art. 'We respect the art and artist; while we'd love to leave the work in place, it's required we lift the gate when we open for business, so after the public has the day to enjoy it, we will remove the door to keep it safe from vandals until we determine where it can be displayed in the future—hopefully inside of the club.' Bansky revealed NYPD officers aching to catch him had halted his activity for at least one day. The world-renowned street artist cancelled Wednesday's artwork after New York officials urged people to file complaints against the London-based man of mystery and boosted NYPD patrols looking for graffiti. The announcement was made late Wednesday morning on his website: 'Today's art has been cancelled due to police activity.' Sphinx: Earlier he unveiled a 1/36 scale replica of the great Sphinx of Giza made from smashed cinderblocks . In Chelsea, New York, he launched this called Atmosphere. The Better Out Than In series finishes next week . Protected: Owners of The Hustler Club were delighted when a graffiti appeared on their wall on Thursday. They sprung into action to protect the piece. Here workers are seen delicately loading it into a van . In Greenwich Village, two Banksy works, 'Sirens of the Lambs' and 'Shoe Shining Ronald McDonald' made a rare appearance together outside a McDonald's . On Saturday, Banksy painted a picture of a boy about to smash a water sprinkler with a hammer, titled 'Better Out Than In', on the Upper West Side. Saul Zabar, of the famed grocery store family, has helped add protective Plexiglass, to preserve the artist's work on his family's building on West 79th St .","The moving installation on Houston Street appeared at 7pm yesterday .
Police arrived to control the crowds but did not object, despite claims from the New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg that Bansky's street art is illegal .
There are just six days left of the anonymous artist's New York exhibition ."
"A pardon for thousands of Irish soldiers who joined the British to fight Nazi Germany will help make amends for the shameful way they were treated after the Second World War, Ireland's Justice Minister has said. The Irish Government has enacted legislation to grant an amnesty to the former troops - who were blacklisted and branded deserters at home. Ahead of the historic move, Alan Shatter said tens of thousands of Irish people put their lives at risk during the global conflict in the fight against fascism and tyranny. Pardoned: John Stout (left) and Con Murphy (right) were among the tens of thousands of  Irishmen who joined the British Army to fight Nazi Germany but were shunned when they returned home . Unsung hero: A citation for Irishman Corporal Edward Brown who took on a Machine Gun post as the British forces advanced through France in  August 1944 . 'The Bill is being enacted in . recognition of the courage and bravery of those individuals court . martialed or dismissed from the Defence Forces who fought on the Allied . side to protect decency and democracy during World War Two,' he said. 'It . gives important statutory expression to the apology given by me on . behalf of the state last year for the shameful manner in which they were . treated.' Mr Shatter . said the pardon would make an important difference to thousands of . families in Ireland and goes some way to right the wrongs of the past. 'Unfortunately, . many of the individuals whose situation is addressed in this Bill did . not live to see the day that this state finally acknowledged the . important role that they played in seeking to ensure a free and safe . Europe,' he added. Mr . Shatter has already apologised to the ex-soldiers, who were dismissed en . masse from the Irish Army under special powers introduced during the . Second World War, known as the Emergency in neutral Ireland. Branded traitor: Paddy Reid (left) was one of the thousands of Irishmen who joined the British Army to fight Nazi Germany . Paddy Reid was the son of a deserter and grew up in Ireland an outcast. He was shunned as a schoolboy and branded a traitor because his father fought Nazis for the British Army. Now, at 62, the soldier's son has nothing but pride for his father of the same name.His one regret: that Paddy Reid senior died before legislation was finally passed vindicating him and others for their bravery during the Second World War. 'Those men did what they believed to be right and they are now vindicated,' Mr Reid said. 'They did nothing wrong and they paid a high price for it throughout their lives.' Barely 16 when he enlisted, the soldier boy was blacklisted and branded a deserter for serving as a gunner for the British Royal Artillery. He returned home in 1946 and struggled for years to find work, living hand to mouth in the deprived Docklands area of Dublin. His wife died at just 39 as the hardship and struggle to feed their eight children took its toll, and it was 15 years after his return before he was granted proper employment, driving a horse and cart for a steamboat company at the docks. 'It took all those years to find work and when he did, he never missed a day in his life,' Mr Reid said of his father, who died in 1984 aged 64. 'He worked through every flu and sickness. He was just so relieved to be employed - the sort of thing you take for granted.' The family lived like social pariahs right up to the 1960s, with the children bearing much of the brunt in the classroom. 'The teachers would let you know that you didn't belong,' said Mr Reid, who now lives in Balbriggan, Co Dublin. 'They would have been very pro-Republican and they made a point of singling you out because you weren't really Irish, you betrayed the country.' He said his father was just a boy when he joined the British Army, and paid for that decision his whole life, but he never regretted it. 'The thing that he did regret was the lives lost in the war. That stayed with him to his dying day - the memories of fighting the Japanese. There was a lot of death. And when he was dying himself, he felt a lot of sorrow for the Japanese soldiers he killed. 'How the soldiers were treated in Ireland was just so petty in comparison.' Mr Reid, a community worker who counsels and teaches literacy, said his family knew no different from the discrimination they endured. It was normal to be shunned in the community, particularly by those considered to be well-off and the 'so-called educated', he said. 'But now there's a great sense of vindication. Those soldiers did what they did and they fought with bravery. They should be remembered for that.' 'Shameful treatment': Irish soldiers, seen on parade in 1939, who joined the British in the fight against Nazi Germany will be formally pardoned by the country's Government . 'Deserters': Many in Ireland believed the soldiers were needed at home, where troops are seen surveying a creamery in Wexford after it was bombed by Nazi warplanes in a violation of the country's neutrality . The Defence Forces (Second World War . Amnesty and Immunity) Bill 2012, passed in the Dail today, provides for the granting of an amnesty . and immunity from prosecution to 5,000 Irish soldiers who fought with . the Allies. They had been found guilty by a military tribunal at the time of going AWOL. It is expected to be signed into law by the Irish President Michael D Higgins . in the next few days. Special . powers brought in - which became known as the starvation order - saw . the deserters barred from state jobs, refused military pensions and . faced with widespread discrimination. Mr . Shatter has referred to the soldiers as idealists and said people's . understanding of history has matured and that it was time for . understanding and forgiveness. Apology: Justice Minister Alan Shatter said the pardon for thousands of Irish soldiers would go some way towards righting the wrongs of the past . In 2006 26 Irish soldiers who were shot at dawn for military offences during the First World War were formally pardoned by the British Government. The pardon was prompted by the years the Irish Shot At Dawn Campaign spent trying to prove the troops - many of whom were still in their teens - should never have been killed. The campaign won the support of the Irish Government, which submitted a report to the British outlining the background to each of the executions in 2004. Legislation was enacted in Britain to clear their names in November 2006. Ireland remained neutral during the Second World War, but that did not stop thousands of soldiers making the decision to leave the Irish Army and the country behind to join Allied troops on the front line. And it was not just Irish troops that joined forces with the British and other Allied leaders on the battlefield as the war rumbled on. The U.S. was neutral early in the war, although it began providing increasing levels of assistance to the Allies before declaring war on Japan in 1941 following it's attack on Pearl Harbour. Support: Initially neutral, the U.S. became a leader of the Allies. American soldiers are seen landing on the coast of France under heavy Nazi fire in June 1944 in this image . It went on to become the primary Allied power in the Pacific Theatre as well as, politically, the leader of the western Allies in forming NATO. Belgium declared its neutrality at the outbreak of war, but joined the Allies after Nazis marched through the country as part of its invasion of France in 1940. Brazil maintained its neutrality until 1942, when it sided with the Allies. In 1944 Brazil became the only Latin American nation to send troops to Europe when it dispatched the 25,000 strong Brazilian Expeditionary Force to fight on the continent. The Netherlands declared its neutrality at the start of the conflict in 1939, but was invaded by the Nazis the following year in the face of fierce resistance. The Dutch joined the Allies and their surviving naval and armed forces joined in the defence of East Asia. Dutch troops fought alongside the Allies in landmark struggles including the Battle of Britain.","Irish soldiers who fought with the Allies were blacklisted at home .

"A trial against a Detroit police officer accused of shooting dead a seven-year-old girl ended in a mistrial after the jury became 'hopelessly deadlocked.' The jurors   were unable to reach a verdict in the case  against Officer Joseph Weekley who was accused of shooting Aiyana Stanley-Jones during a raid on a house for a murder suspect in Detroit. Judge Cynthia Gray Hathaway  declared a mistrial in the case for the second time after the first trial ended in a hung jury in June 2013. Death: Happy-go-lucky seven-year-old Aiyana Stanley-Jones was shot and killed on Sunday, May 16, 2010, by a  Detroit police officer during a raid to arrest a murder suspect . Shooting: Detroit Police Officer Joseph Weekley testifies during his first trial in Wayne County Circuit Court in Detroit, Michigan, his second trial was declared a mistrial on Friday . Judge Hathaway told the jurors: 'These things happen.’ But the little girl's distraught uncle Londell Fields said: 'I don't understand how we can go through this again and have all this evidence brought forth and there not be a verdict either way.' 'I don't think it's fair because he's a police officer that he gets to get away with this again. That's wrong to me.' At the beginning of the case, jurors were asked to decide the officer's fate. Yet the group of 12 was almost split down the middle over whether to acquit or convict Weekley on a misdemeanor charge of careless, reckless or negligent use of a firearm causing death. ‘This was an emotional case,’ the jury foreman told the media afterward. ‘There were tears in this room.’ Distraught: The parents of Aiyana Stanley-Jones, Dominika Stanley, left, and Charles Jones, hold a photo of her in Southfield, Michigan, both are devastated over the mistrial . But race, the jurors said, never played a role in deliberations, despite the fact that Weekley is white, and Aiyana was black. On the night of the shooting on May 16, 2010, police and the Special Response Team went to an address in Detroit's east side to carry out a search for a murder suspect. They were accompanied by a camera crew from a TV reality show called 'The First 48, but the midnight raid was recorded from the outside, not the inside where Aiyana was shot. A stun grenade was thrown through a window to confuse anyone inside. Then, officers stormed the house and once inside, a round from Weekley's sub-machine gun struck Aiyana in the head while she slept on a couch. The trial featured a multicultural jury made up of eight women and four men, four of whom were African Americans. The jurors, asked that their names not be made public as they explained what happened over four days of deliberations. Sadness: Dominika Stanley wipes away tears after Judge Cynthia Gray Hathaway declares a mistrial . They said that they never agreed unanimously, but  listened to each others view points, took three votes and had some jurors shift sides. The jury foreman, a pastor said: ‘This has not been an easy case.’ During the last vote, the panel was split 7 to 5, with seven voting not guilty and five saying Weekley was guilty of the charge. Grief: Charles Jones, center, the father of seven-year-old  Aiyana Stanley-Jones, is consoled by family and friends as they stand in front of Aiyana's open casket before the funeral service at Second Ebenezer Baptist Church in Detroit on Saturday, May 22, 2010 . One of the most important questions that jurors needed to answer was whether the discharge of the weapon was a result of the defendant's carelessness, recklessness or negligence. Some jurors felt Weekley, should not have allowed his gun to discharge because of his training as a member of the Special Response Team, while others could not determine what happened . ‘It really came down to defining negligence,’ the foreman said. During the trial, Steve Fishman, Weekley's attorney, told jurors that the officer mistakenly pulled the trigger during a struggle with Mertilla Jones, the girl's grandmother. But Jones denied this. Prosecutor Rob Moran argued: 'His training says, keep your finger off the trigger. ... All he had to do is follow his training and we wouldn't be here.' After the mistrial, Dominika Stanley, Aiyana's mother stayed in the courtroom, wiping away tears as she shook her head and held onto a tissue. Meanwhile, Weekley released a statement shortly before the mistrial was declared. It said: ‘No matter the outcome of any jury's decision, I have already been devastated and my life has been ruined irreparably by the events that occurred on May 16, 2010. 'There has not been one single day that has gone by since that day where I have not thought about the loss of Aiyana and I will be haunted by this tragedy for the rest of my life.' ‘I have nothing but sympathy for the family of Aiyana ... I know in my heart and before God that what transpired that day was out of my control, but I will still have terrible grief weigh upon me every day for the rest of my life,’ his statement said. But Aiyana's great-uncle Fields added that he thought Weekley should apologize and say he made a mistake. ‘The justice system did not work in this case,’ he said. ‘I don't understand how we could go through this again and have all this evidence brought forth and there not be a verdict, either way.’ Weekely could still face a third re-trial.","Jurors were unable to reach a verdict in the case against Joseph Weekley .

"A 'maternity hotel' is charging foreign mothers thousands of dollars so they can give birth to American citizens, it was revealed on Monday. The popular Santa Anita Inn in Arcadia, California has allegedly been keeping guests who sign up for 'birth tourism' packages in two of its secluded buildings - at a cost of $20,000 for the service. Motel guests reportedly have seen women receiving a 'pregnancy service' with 24/7 nurses and meals delivered to their rooms as they prepare to give birth. Scroll down for video . Welcome inn: The Santa Anita Inn in Arcadia, California has allegedly been offering 'birth tourism' packages to foreign mothers, allowing their babies to gain U.S. citizenship rights . Guest: A pregnant guest is filmed at the motel. There are no laws refusing women entry to the U.S. so they can give birth to babies here . The practice has been denied by the motel's owners. The activity is not illegal and is widespread across California. Sources told KTLA a new . family arrives every three to four months at the motel. The Santa Anita Inn is a popular . choice as it has glowing online reviews. Arcadia city officials said that they were aware what was going on at the Arcadia motel but were powerless to intervene. Assistant City Manager Jason . Kruckeberg said: 'A number of the rooms over there are being rented by . pregnant individuals. They city has been aware of that for quite some . time.' The practice is popular with Chinese . women who travel to the U.S. on tourist visas in order to give birth . to children who automatically become American citizens. Popular motel: Some hotels offering maternity services can charge a mother up to $20,000 a time . Cosy: Foreign mothers are believed to be paying around $20,000 to stay at the Santa Anita Inn for the weeks leading up to the birth and the month after . The practice of 'birth tourism' does not violate federal law but there are dubious ethical issues surrounding the practice. It is written into the U.S. constitution under the 14th Amendment that those born in the U.S. will be granted citizenship. According to studies on 'birth tourism' it is popular with wealthy mothers-to-be from several countries including China, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey. Although most mothers return home after giving birth, because their child has been born in the U.S., it allows them to get around strict international rules for studying at American colleges. Once they turn 21, the children can also petition for permanent residency for their parents through family reunification. The government estimates that there were 7,462 births to foreign residents in 2008. The Center for Immigration Studies said close to  40,000 births each year are to 'birth tourists' - however that number could be as high as 200,000. The cost of having a so-called . 'anchor . baby' in America is estimated at $20,000. This includes accommodation, . care in the weeks running up to the birth and for a month . afterwards. Assistance with immigration paperwork is normally included . in the deal. The Santa Anita Inn is a pleasant but . basic establishment offering rooms with satellite TV, wi-fi, . mini-fridges and coffee-makers. Most rooms have a patio or balcony area. There . is also an outdoor swimming pool at the property along with a whirlpool . jacuzzi and outdoor barbecue. The average cost of one night in a . king-size room in $89, according to the motel's website. 'Maternity hotels' don't violate federal law - a woman is permitted to travel to the U.S. on a tourist visa and give birth. 'Birth tourism' allows babies born to . foreign mothers to hold American citizenship - and a host of rights in . the U.S. including access to education. The hotels involved in the practice tend to keep a low-profile as they come under fire from campaigners. A task-force was established last month by the Los Angeles County Board . of Supervisors after numerous complaints across the state about similar . establishments. In Chino Hills last month, a campaign group was set up to oppose 'birth tourism' taking place at a large gated property. The demonstrators were against the ethical element of 'birth tourism' along with practical issues such as the constant stream of traffic at the site.

"Apology: Jeremy Clarkson at Heathrow on Thursday following the outcry over his comments . Jeremy Clarkson was forced to apologise last night after a joke he made about executing public sector workers for going on strike triggered a political row and thousands of complaints. The outspoken TV presenter faced a storm of protest after saying public sector strikers should be ‘executed’ in front of their families. In a day of extraordinary overreaction to what was clearly meant as a joke, one union official threatened to report him to police, while another said his comments were worthy of Colonel Gaddafi. Even the Prime Minister, a friend of Mr Clarkson, was dragged into the row, describing the remarks as ‘silly’, while Ed Miliband said they were ‘disgusting’. By yesterday evening, when Mr Clarkson was finally forced to issue an apology, the BBC had received almost 5,000 complaints about the interview on Wednesday night’s edition of The One Show. The row erupted after millions saw the Top Gear host asked for his views on the day’s nationwide strikes. He started by saying he liked the strikers, because the industrial action had meant there was no traffic on the roads. But after insisting he had to be balanced as he worked for the impartial BBC, he launched into a satirical rant. He said: ‘Frankly, I would have them shot. I would have them taken outside and executed in front of their families.’ Later in the show, he also complained about people who commit suicide by throwing themselves on railway lines, saying trains should not stop for them.

Yesterday, the Prime Minister, whose . ‘Chipping Norton Set’ of friends includes Mr Clarkson, former News of . the World and Sun editor Rebekah Brooks and PR man Matthew Freud, was . forced to disassociate himself from the comments. Asked about them on ITV’s This Morning show, Mr Cameron said it was ‘a silly thing to say – I’m sure he didn’t mean it’. Labour leader Mr Miliband said the . remark was ‘absolutely disgraceful and disgusting’, adding: ‘He . obviously does not understand the lives of the people who were going out . on strike yesterday.’ The unions exploded in fury, with . Unison calling on the BBC to sack the presenter and even contacting . lawyers to consider whether he could be reported to the police for . inciting violence. Dave Prentis, Unison’s general . secretary, said: ‘The One Show is broadcast at a time when children are . watching: they could have been scared and upset by his aggressive . statements. ‘While he is driving round in fast . cars for a living, public sector workers are busy holding our society . together: they save others’ lives on a daily basis, they care for the . sick, the vulnerable, the elderly. ‘They wipe bottoms, noses, they help . children to learn, and empty bins – they deserve all our thanks – . certainly not the unbelievable level of abuse he threw at them.’ The union’s health spokesman Karen Jennings went so far as describing the comments as ‘almost like Gaddafi’. Thousands of public sector workers joined pickets and marches across the country on Wednesday in a strike over pensions and cuts . Bob Crow, leader of the RMT union, . said Mr Clarkson was a ‘man who bleeds a fortune out of the . licence-payer for poncing around the world driving luxury cars’. ‘Clarkson’s incitement to violence, . and the refusal of David Cameron to roundly condemn it, is grossly . offensive to all public sector workers but even more so to our members . on the Royal Fleet Auxiliary who were on strike on Wednesday and who . risk their lives in trouble spots around the world servicing the Naval . fleet,’ he said.

Awkward: One Show presenters Matt Baker and Alex Jones were forced to apologise for Clarkson's comments . Jeremy Clarkson's remarks about wanting to shoot strikers are the latest in a long line of controversial comments that are likely to add to his ever-increasing list of enemies. In February 2009, he famously called then Prime Minister Gordon Brown a 'one-eyed Scottish idiot' and in November the previous year, the BBC received almost 2,000 complaints when he joked about lorry drivers murdering prostitutes. More recently, in October, it emerged he had taken out an injunction to prevent allegations about his private life being published. Back in September 2005, he had a custard pie thrown in his face by green campaigners after picking up an honorary degree at Oxford Brookes University. Also that year, he offered some 'handy hints' to cyclists, saying: 'Do not cruise through red lights. Because if I'm coming the other way, I will run you down, for fun.' In November 2004, conservationists accused him of ruining virgin hillside during an off-road test of a Land Rover for the motoring programme. And in February 2004, the BBC paid £250 compensation to Churchill Parish Council in Somerset after Clarkson drove a 4x4 Toyota pick-up truck into a 30-year-old horse chestnut tree to test the vehicle's strength. ‘GMB works with trade unions . representing employees on banana and pineapple plantations in Latin . America where activists have met exactly the fate that Mr Clarkson . describes.’ By 5pm yesterday, the presenter had issued an apology. When Mr Clarkson was asked for his . reaction before flying out of the country, he said: ‘See what I actually . said and then judge. 'I didn’t for a moment intend these remarks to be . taken seriously – as I believe is clear if they’re seen in context. 'If . the BBC and I have caused any offence, I’m quite happy to apologise for . it alongside them.’ The BBC said: ‘The One Show is a live topical . programme which often reflects the day’s talking points. Usually we get . it right, but on this occasion we feel the item wasn’t perfectly judged. 'The BBC and Jeremy would like to apologise for any offence caused.’ Last night Tory MP Douglas Carswell called for a sense of perspective. ‘We shouldn’t rise to the bait on this,’ he said. ‘This is politicians causing mischief.’ Clarkson’s comments have regularly landed him in hot water. Earlier this year, an item on Top Gear led to a complaint from the Mexican ambassador over ‘vulgar’ insults about Mexicans. He called the then prime minister . Gordon Brown a ‘one-eyed Scottish idiot’ and triggered 2,000 complaints . when he joked about lorry drivers murdering prostitutes.","David Cameron tells the Top Gear presenter it was a 'silly thing to say'

"The U.S. Homeland Security chief has flatly denied that ISIS members crossed the Mexican border into Texas – as conservative lawmakers claimed – but did admit that four Kurdish terrorists did slip through. DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson was forced to deny that 10 people linked to ISIS had entered Texas after Republican Representative Duncan Hunter made the startling claim on Fox News on Tuesday. But on Thursday, Johnson conceded that four members the Kurdistan Workers' Party, known as the PKK, were arrested in September trying to enter the United States illegally from Mexico. The PKK, a separatist group in Turkey, is deemed a 'foreign terrorist organization' by the U.S. government – but  it has allied itself with other Kurdish groups fighting ISIS. Denial: U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson, who is pictured last week, denied that ISIS terrorists had been captured at the Mexico-Texas border but said four anti-Islamic fighters were arrested last month . In his speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Johnson noted that the PKK was 'actually fighting against ISIL and defended Kurdish territory in Iraq'. They had been arrested for unlawful entry, detained and would be deported by U.S. authorities, he said in a speech in Washington. But in an interview with CBS News, Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah stood by his concerns, noting that the PKK has been designated a foreign terrorist organization by the State Department. 'I don't think that should be dismissed as insignificant,' he said in the earlier interview. 'It does demonstrate how porous or our border is. These are terrorists nonetheless and they had no trouble crossing our southern border. That's a problem that must be addressed.' He claimed that the men flew into Mexico City, hired someone to smuggle them across the Rio Grande and then get them to a safe house. They intended to make their way to New York City, although there is no specific indication they were here to commit a terrorist act, he said. Fears: Rep. Duncan Hunter stunned a Fox News audience earlier this week by saying that the US has apprehended about ten ISIS terrorists as they entered the country through the Mexican border . Several conservative politicians and media outlets have claimed in recent days that Islamic State militants had infiltrated the United States from Mexico, which Johnson and other administration officials have denied. On Tuesday, Representative Duncan Hunter, a California Republican, told Fox News that 'at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas'. He added: 'ISIS doesn't have a navy, they don't have an air force, they don't have nuclear weapons. The only way that ISIS is going to harm Americans is by coming in through the southern border -which they already have.' Hunter said his information came directly from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which has a 20,000-strong army of agents patrolling the borders in Texas, Arizona, New Mexico and California. 'The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,' a Homeland Security spokesman said in a statement. Vulnerable: Much of the Texas-Mexico border is undefended, with US Border Patrol agents setting up well on the American side. In September, four men from an anti-Islamic Kurdish party entered the country . A second Republican, Representative Tom Cotton, a Senate candidate in Arkansas, said last month that the Islamic State was collaborating with Mexican drug cartels. But U.S. intelligence and national security officials said that U.S. agencies had no evidence that anyone connected with the Islamic State or other jihadist groups fighting in Iraq or Syria have tried to cross into the United States from Mexico. The officials also said they were unaware of any threat or plots by the Islamic State or related groups coming from Mexico. Hunter, like many in the GOP, has advocated in the past for strengthening America's border security to the south, a demand that has largely fallen on deaf ears during the Obama presidency. During a 2013 Senate hearing, then-Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said that due to the administration's 'significant progress and efforts .. our borders have, in fact, never been stronger.'","Republican Rep.

In London, according to his Facebook profile, he attended a private Katy Perry concert and was close enough to snap a photo of the 'California Girls' singer on his phone. Rodger grew up in tony Woodland Hills, Los Angeles in a four bedroom, five bath home that is valued at just under $1million. His father is Peter Rodger, a top Hollywood honcho, who served as assistant director for The Hunger Games. His grandfather, George Rodger, was a legend in the photography world who was a founding member of Magnum Photos. His mother, Lichin 'Chin' Rodger, is a nurse from Malaysia. Peter divorced Chin and married Soumaya Akaaboune, a French-Moroccan actress who stars in the French version of the Real Housewives. She recently had roles in 2013's Lovelace and the 2012 film Playing for Keeps. Elliot Rodger has one little sister and a half brother from his father's second marriage.

"Star Trek actor William Shatner has joined growing calls for Nasa to investigate a bizarre 'jelly doughnut' shaped rock on the Martian surface. Shatner asked Nasa about the strange Mars rock found by Opportunity via Twitter during a press conference on the Opportunity rovers latest discoveries - asking mission controllers if they had ruled out 'Martian rock throwers'. Mission controllers responding by saying Shatner's theory was 'unlikely'. An strange rock, seen here on the left image, mysteriously appeared in front of Opportunity rover in the beginning of the month. An American writer claims it 'grew' there and is demanding Nasa investigate further . Shatner asked asking mission controllers if they had ruled out 'Martian rock throwers' in the mystery over the jelly donut rock . 'We've got another question from Twitter, this one from William Shatner,' NASA spokesman Guy Webster said, according to space.com. 'He'd like to know if you've ruled out the Martian rock throwers in the case of the jelly doughnut.' Mars rover lead scientist Steve Squyres of Cornell University responded, saying 'I think Martian rock throwers are unlikely, though we'll keep our eyes open for those.' 'We did actually have another scenario which we're still thinking about. 'It's the 'smoking hole in the ground hypothesis' as I've called it. 'We cannot yet rule out the possibility with certainty that there wasn't a freshly formed impact crater nearby, and that this is a piece of stuff that was thrown out by a small impact. ' A controversial science writer has already filed a lawsuit against Nasa for their failure to investigate whether a rock seen on Mars is in fact an alien lifeform. Last week the rock mysteriously appeared in front of the Opportunity rover, even though the same spot was empty a few days before. It is believed the rock, which is made up of manganese, suplhur and magnesium, suddenly appeared after it was dislodged by a meteorite or even the rover itself. Opportunity landed on Mars in 2004 in what was to be a three-month mission. Instead the rover has lived beyond its prime mission and roved the planet for nearly 10 years. The rover is currently at 'Solander Point' at the rim of Endeavour Crater on Mars. The rover hasn't moved in over a month as it waits for better weather on the red planet. During its time on Mars, the rover has identified rock laden with what scientists believed to be clay minerals. Their presence is an indication that the rock has been altered at some point in the past through prolonged contact with water. But author Rhawn Joseph, who writes on a wide variety of subjects - including books theorising that life on Earth has its roots in outer space - rejects such mundane explanations. The lawsuit, filed in a California court, is aimed at Nasa and requests that it 'perform a public, scientific, and statutory duty which is to closely photograph and thoroughly scientifically examine and investigate a putative biological organism'. Popular Science reports that Joseph has blasted the rock theory, since his examination found 'the same structure in miniature was clearly visible upon magnification and appears to have just germinated from spores'. In other words, it grew there. The suit adds: 'The refusal to take close up photos from various angles, the refusal to take microscopic images of the specimen, the refusal to release high resolution photos, is inexplicable, recklessly negligent, and bizarre.' He alleges that Nasa have not investigated the spore-rock closely as they trying to gut planetary exploration programmes and serve corporate interests. He added: 'The only other exploration is that Nasa's rover team is outrageously negligent, obscenely incompetent, shockingly ignorant about basic biology and prone to magical thinking.' Lead Mars Exploration rover scientist Steve Squyres recently told a Nasa event: 'We are as we speak situated with the rover's instruments deployed making measurements of this rock. 'We've taken pictures of both the doughnut and jelly parts, and the got the first data on the composition of the jelly yesterday. 'It's like nothing we've ever seen before,' he said. 'It's very high in sulphur, it's very high in magnesium, it's got twice as much manganese as we've ever seen in anything on Mars. 'I don't know what any of this means. We're completely confused, and everyone in the team is arguing and fighting (over what it means).' The discovery led Nasa last week to issue a Mars status report entitled ""encountering a surprise"".' 'Opportunity encountered a slight surprise -- a rock had appeared in the images that had not been there before.,' Nasa said in a statement. A panoramic image of the Martian area named 'Lion King,' showing 'Eagle Crater' and the surrounding plains of Meridiani Planum on Mars taken by the Rover Opportunity . 'This target that has been named 'Pinnacle Island' and its origin has been the target of much speculation. 'It will likely be the target of considerable investigation over the next few days' 'We saw this rock just sitting here,' said Squyres. 'It looks white around the edge in the middle and there’s a low spot in the centre that's dark red - it looks like a jelly doughnut.' The rover, which landed on Mars in 2004, hasn't moved in over a month as it waits for better weather on the red planet. But a photo taken on Sol 3540 (January 8th, or the 3,540th Martian solar day since the Opportunity rover landed) shows a rock that wasn't visible in previous photos taken on Sol 3536. Astronomers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, who maintain the rover camera database for Nasa, have named the ‘donut-sized’ rock Pinnacle Island. Mr Squyres said the rock may be Martian rock that was blown out of the ground by a meteoroid impact and landed next to the rover. Another theory is that the rock previously got stuck in a rover wheel and finally fell into its current position,according to a report in Discovery News. ‘[The rock] obligingly turned upside down, so we're seeing a side that hasn't seen the Martian atmosphere in billions of years and there it is for us to investigate,’ Mr Squyres said. Opportunity landed on Mars in 2004 in what was to be a three-month mission. 10 years later, and it is still active on the red planet . ‘It's just a stroke of luck.’ Opportunity has been on Mars for 10 years, despite being designed for a 90 Sol mission . A Sol, one Martian day, is slightly longer than an Earth day at 24 hours and 37 minutes. Its mission has been extended several times as it continues to make new and profound discoveries about the red planet. In December 2012, for instance mission scientists announced that Opportunity was exploring a special spot on the rim of Endeavour Crater. The area, known as Matijevic Hill, was found to contain clay minerals, implying that the area was exposed to water billions of years ago.","Photo from January 8 shows a rock that wasn't visible in previous images .

"An Australian couple who became trapped in Thailand with their newborn twins following changes to the country's commercial surrogacy laws have finally arrived back home in Australia. Kate and Adam Osborne, from Kempsey on NSW's mid-north coast, landed at Port Macquarie airport with their twin daughters on Tuesday morning to a crowd of waiting friends and family. Sierra-Leone and Mali Osborne were born on July 22 in Bangkok to a Thai surrogate mother. But due to changes to Thai surrogacy laws when the twins were born, the couple were unable to bring the girls home until they had a court order granting consent from the birth mother. Scroll down for video . Kate and Adam Osborne's twin daughters, Mali and Sierra-Leone, were born in Thailand on July 22 on the same day that Thai laws regarding commercial surrogacy changed . Kate (far right) and Adam, from Kempsey on NSW's mid-north coast, landed at Port Macquarie airport with their twin daughters on Tuesday morning to a crowd of waiting friends and family . Mr and Mrs Osborne, 40 and 35, spent a month in a hotel room with their newborn daughters while they were locked in a legal battle with the Thai government. 'It's such a relief to finally be home,' Mr Osborne told the Daily Telegraph. The couple had spent more than $100,000 and six years trying to start a family and turned to Thai surrogacy as a last resort after numerous failed IVF attempts in Australia. Mali and Sierra-Leone were born just weeks before the horrific story of baby Gammy emerged and shocked the world. Gammy, also a twin, was born to a Thai surrogate mother, Pattaramon Chanbua, but was allegedly abandoned by his West Australian parents because he had Down syndrome. Gammy's biological father David Farnell later revealed in a 60 Minutes interview he would have terminated the embryo had he discovered the child's Down syndrome sooner, saying: 'No parent wants a son with a disability'. The couple turned to a Thai surrogate after failed IVF attempts in Australia. They were stranded in a Thai motel with their newborn girls for a month . Mr Osborne had earlier explained that they could not simply bring their children home to Australia now, despite having all the required Australian documentation. 'Our twin girls have all their relevant paperwork (Australian citizenship, Australian passports),' he said. 'Before the Thai army cracked down on commercial surrogacy on the twins birthday (22/7/2014)  you could just leave the country without anyone batting an eyelid with your new family. 'Now its a different story, now its considered ""Human trafficking"" because they see it as though we are stealing someones children, and if they ask to see babies' birth certificate that is proof because our surrogate's name is on certificate as their mother. 'We had D.N.A tests done and our babies are our babies and in no way, shape or form are related to birth mother (our surrogate). So we have to go through the courts now and get a court order to leave the country.' At the end of July the laws radically changed to mean parents of surrogate children born in the country can no longer leave Thailand with their children without a court order . The Kempsey couple posted photos of their baby girls from the Thai motel room they were staying in . Friends of Mr and Mrs Osborne had set up a fundraising page to raise money to pay for new flights home and their unexpectedly long stay in Thailand. When the couple and their daughters arrived home on Tuesday, more than $8,000 had been raised. The couple have reportedly signed a deal with Channel 7 to tell their story on the Sunday Night program, the Telegraph reports. Mr Osborne explained that they could not simply bring their children home to Australia, despite having all the required Australian documentation . A statement from the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, regarding Australian parents being prevented from bringing their children home from Thailand, said: 'We have been advised that Thai authorities may enforce enhanced documentation requirements when exiting the country, when they suspect a child has been born by surrogacy in Thailand. 'The Australian Government's Smartraveller website was updated on 14 August to reflect these requirements. 'We strongly urge Australians entering Thailand for the purposes of commercial surrogacy to seek independent legal advice in both Thailand and Australia before doing so. In particular, they should seek advice on the implications of any new exit requirements. 'While regulation of surrogacy in Thailand is a matter for Thailand, we continue to encourage Thai authorities to adopt appropriate transitional arrangements for any new measures they may introduce, so concerned Australians are not unduly affected.' Wendy and David Farnell caused international outrage by abandoning baby Gammy, who has Down syndrome, in Thailand while taking his sister Pipah (pictured) home to Western Australia .","Kate and Adam Osborne were trapped in Thailand with their newborn twins following changes to surrogacy laws .

"Archaeologists are convinced they've unearthed the secret behind the world's most famous painting, the Mona Lisa. Buried beneath the floor of a convent in Florence, Italy they've found a skeleton they believe belonged to Lisa Gherardini, the model who posed for Leonardo's da Vinci's mysterious masterpiece. Ancient find: Archeologists have found a skeleton they believe belonged to the model who inspired Da Vinci's Mona Lisa . An archaeologist digs away at the floor of the medieval Convent of Saint Ursula in Florence, where the skeleton was discovered . The convent was the burial site of  Lisa Gherardini, wife of the wealthy Florentine silk merchant Francesco del Giocondo, who modelled for Leonardo Da Vinci . Lisa Gheradini, was the wife of a . rich silk merchant named Francesco del Giocondo. In Italy the Mona Lisa . is known as La Gioconda. Most . modern historians agree that the lady depicted in the Mona Lisa was . Lisa del Giocondo, who became a nun after her husband's death. She died . in the convent on July 15, 1542, aged 63. An archeological team began digging at the abandoned Convent of Saint Ursula last year. They first had to dig through thick concrete, laid down ahead of plans to turn the convent into an army barracks. But they quickly struck gold, finding a crypt they believe to have been Lisa's final resting place and soon after they unearthed a female-sized human skull. The skull was found five feet under the convent's original floor along with other fragments of human ribs and vertebrae. Plans to continue the dig were suspended when the team ran out of funds, but they were able to resume last month. And this week, they found a human skeleton. The team unearthed a skull and other bones last year that they believe belonged to Lisa Gherardini . The skull was found five feet under the convent's original floor along with other fragments of human ribs and vertebrae . The bones will undergo tests to establish if they match the skull found last year. Scientists will then compare the DNA in the bones with the remains of the model's two children who were buried nearby in an attempt to authenticate the . Muse: The enigmatic Mona Lisa has intrigued millions . Once they have verified the skeleton and skull belong to the modelf orensic artists will attempt to reconstruct her face to see how it compares to the 500-year-old version painted by da Vinci - and perhaps solve the riddle of the Mona Lisa's enigmatic smile in the process. Archeologist Silvano Vinceti, who is in charge of the dig, explained: 'We don't know yet if the bones belong to one single skeleton or more than one. 'But this confirms our hypothesis that in St.Ursula convent there are still human bones and we cannot exclude that among them there are bones belonging to Lisa Gherardini.' The initial discovery - made using . ground penetrating radar and ancient maps and documents - came after a . foot of modern concrete was removed and unearthed a layer of ancient, . 90-centimeter wide bricks. Professor . Vinceti said of the first discovery: 'This is a very exciting . development and the find is consistent with our records and our . preliminary research. 'The . crypt we have found is the one that was mentioned in church records from . 1495 and was reached via a grate and then a staircase. 'We also know from those records that in 1625 there was a second crypt and these are the ones we have found.' Resting place: The courtyard of the Saint Ursula convent in Florence, where archaeologists have been digging . Present on the dig is Natalia Gucciardini Strozzi, who is related to Lisa Gherardini and who is also a close friend of Prince Charles and former Prime Minister Tony Blair. Speaking after the skull was discovered, she said: 'It was so emotional being here - I didn't think I would get so emotional. I am certain that this is the final resting place of Lisa Gherardini. It is not the first time that Professor Vinceti has used such techniques in his work - last year similar methods were used to locate and identify the remains of Caravaggio, another Renaissance master. Last year in a Dan Brown-style mystery professor Vincenti also claimed that a hidden message could be seen in the eyes of the Mona Lisa after examining them with a high powered magnifying glass. The Mona Lisa is an oil on panel painting owned by the French government and the image is so widely recognised and caricatured that it is considered the most famous painting in the world. Da Vinci started to paint it in 1503 or 1504 and finished it in 1519, shortly before his death, and after he had moved to France.","Find comes a year after skull was unearthed at the same site .

"A group of migrants arriving on a Canary Islands nudist beach caused panic among naked holidaymakers when they reported having symptoms associated with Ebola. To the shock of nudist holidaymakers, the 19 migrants landed on the Gran Canaria beach of Maspalomas about 8.30am and were isolated for seven hours while authorities struggled to decide what to do. Several of the migrants said they were from Sierra Leone and Guinea - two of the most badly affected countries in the current outbreak. Scroll down for video . Nudists look on in shock as the group of migrants are kept isolated by the water's edge . A dump truck was later used to transport the migrants off the beach and to a holding centre . The dump truck is backed up against a sand dune while the group of migrants climb aboard one by one . Several members of the group that arrived on the beach said they were from Sierra Leone and Guinea . The group, which landed on the holiday island earlier this week, were kept huddled together at the waterside while beachgoers were separated from them, Spanish newspaper El Mundo reported. The Red Cross arrived and quickly established a cordon separating the group from the nearby nudists, then began taking their temperatures while wearing protective gear such as breathing masks and gloves. Eventually, the authorities used a dump truck to collect the group and take them away to a holding center. Local authorities later confirmed none of the group were carrying the deadly virus, although four were taken to hospital with health issues. Marco Aurelio Perez, the mayor of San Bartolome, told the paper: 'It presents risks because it is an established destination. Authorities wearing protective gear discuss how to proceed after the group arrived, sparking an Ebola scare . The group - who arrived on the Spanish island by boat - spent seven hours in the sun before being taken away . Red Cross workers took four of the group to hospital, while the remainder were sent to a holding camp . Two migrants rest on Maspalomas Beach on the island of Gran Canaria after arriving on a fishing boat . A tourist couple watch from the top of a sand dune as the group wait to be given the all-clear . The head of the UN mission to fight Ebola has said he does not have the resources to defeat the disease which is still accelerating in some areas of Africa. Tony Banbury said more help is urgently needed as some villages have still received no help, despite significant contributions from the UK, China, Cuba and the US. He said bed space was still a huge issue but claimed he was hopeful of achieving as the target of giving beds to 70 per cent of patients by December. The confirmed death toll is now 4,818, according to the World Health Organisation. Mr Banbury said the disease is still a 'crisis' in many areas while speaking at the UN headquarters for Ebola response in Ghana, which has not been affected by the epidemic. He said his organisation does not yet have the capacity to defeat the disease. 'Unfortunately, illegal immigration has become a common sight in the West.' He added that the dump truck was used because the beach was so remote and it would require multiple trips had they used ambulances. The beach the immigrants landed in is a popular nudist area, with access only possible on foot through a two kilometer walk across sand dunes. Meanwhile, the Spanish nurse who contracted Ebola in Madrid hopes her infection can be of use to authorities and she has offered to give blood to treat potential sufferers. Teresa Romero, 44, overcame the deadly virus after becoming the first known person to catch Ebola outside West Africa during the current outbreak. Her contagion, which was passed when she cared for two priests repatriated from West Africa and who later died in Madrid, caused a backlash against the Spanish government, with health workers claiming they had received inadequate training and equipment to deal with Ebola. 'I don't know what went wrong, I don't even know if anything went wrong,' Mrs Romero told a news conference, referring to the source of the contagion, which is still being investigated. Police wear protective masks as a group of would-be migrants rest on Maspalomas beach . Local authorities later confirmed none of the group of would-be migrants were carrying the deadly virus . Beach goers watch on in the distance as medical teams and police officers work at Maspalomas beach . 'I only know that I am not reproachful or resentful, but if my infection can be of some use, so that the disease can be studied better or to help find a vaccine or to cure other people, here I am.' Romero was given antibodies from a missionary nun who had caught Ebola in Liberia and who had also survived, as well as an experimental drug called favipiravir, doctors said. They added it was not clear exactly which part of the treatment had been key to her recovery. Unfortunately, she and her husband's dog, Excalibur, was put down last month by Madrid authorities on fears it might pose an infection risk, prompting a public outcry. In the coming weeks, Facebook will add a button to its news feed so users can simply click to donate to  nonprofit organisations currently battling Ebola. The groups are the International Medical Corps, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and Save the Children. The social media company is also donating and deploying 100 satellite communication terminals to boost Internet and phone services to affected areas in West Africa. The latest figures from the World Health Organisation put the Ebola crisis death toll at 4,818, with more than 13,000 confirmed cases. While attempts to halt its spread have increased in recent weeks, fears remain the virus will continue to run rampant as the United Nations (UN) pleads for the international community to contribute more resources to combat it. The number of Ebola cases is surging in Sierra Leone as the country suffers from a lack of treatment centres, while lack of food and basic goods is forcing some people to leave quarantine areas, the UN said. Sierra Leone is emerging as the focal point for concern in the worst Ebola outbreak on record as the number of cases in the country continues to rise, while it stabilises in neighbouring Guinea and slows in Liberia. The country has has 288 beds spread across four Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) treating 196 confirmed cases of the disease . However, the European Union has now pledged to invest £218 million into Ebola research, while it is also beginning its biggest single operation of transporting supplies to West Africa. Today a Dutch ship set sail from the Netherlands loaded with ambulances, mobile hospitals, laboratories and other equipment provided by nine European countries.

"An Afghan woman raped by her cousin’s husband has revealed how she is faced with a horrific dilemma – marry him or spend the next 12 years in jail. Gulnaz was aged just 19 when she was convicted by a court of adultery, even though she tried to prevent the attack. Now she is in Kabul's Badam Bagh jail, serving out her sentence with her rapist’s child. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Locked up: Gulnaz is in Kabul's Badam Bagh jail, serving out her sentence with her rapist's child . But now she has been given an option that most women would consider nothing less than repulsive - starting a new life with the man who attacked her. And, even more incredibly, she is willing to. Dressed in a veil, with her baby in her lap, Gulnaz explained how it was the only way out of jail, and the only way around the dishonour of having sex outside marriage. She recalls the day that changed her life two years ago, which began her long nightmare. Despite new laws being brought in, Afghan officials are not bothering to prosecute rape cases and beatings suffered by women. Indictments were filed on just 155 occasions following an estimated 2,299 incidents of violence against women. Women had few rights under the harsh rule of the Taliban, who were ousted in 2001, and an improvement in the lot of women has been a top priority of Western backers of the government of President Hamid Karzai. But despite reform, the Elimination of Violence Against Women law is not being used. Missed cases that could of being prosecuted under the rules include that of two sisters, 15 and 17, who were killed in western Herat province in July 2010 after the elder teenager refused to marry an older man. The future husband and father-in-law were sentenced to 16 years in prison, while three other people were acquitted. In central Daikondi province, a prosecutor used the law to challenge a verdict by a court that found two girls impregnated by a 60-year-old religious leader guilty of adultery. An appeals court rejected that challenge, the U.N. mission said. A woman in southern Kandahar province complained in March of her daughter's forced suicide. She said the girl, who had been sold into marriage for $6,600, set herself on fire in her room when, after 10 years of the marriage, her in-laws forced her to have sex with three male guests visiting the family. Her assailant arrived at the house when her mother left for a brief visit to the hospital. ‘He had filthy clothes on as he does metal and construction work,’ she told CNN in an exclusive interview. ‘He closed doors and windows. I started screaming, but he shut me up by putting his hands on my mouth,’ she said. After the attack, she hid what happened as long as she could. But soon she began showing the signs of morning sickness. She received not sympathy but prosecution. But she appreciates she is lucky to get a second chance. Many women in her position have been killed, for the shame such incidents bring on the community. Now, if she marries her attacker she has a chance to restore her honour and to give her child a family. ‘I was asked if I wanted to start a new life by getting released, by marrying this man’. She added: ‘My daughter is a little innocent child. Who knew I would have a child in this way. A lot of people told me that after your daughter's born give it to someone else, but my aunt told me to keep her as proof of my innocence.' CNN tracked down Gulnaz's rapist in a jail across town. He denied raping her, but agreed that she would be a likely target if she got out of jail. He insists that it will be her family, not his, that will kill her. But Gulnaz's plight has found international attention. The European Union part-funded the team of documentary makers who interviewed her and other women facing a similar plight but have decided to spike the project after watching it. The EU said it was concerned about the safety of the women in the film, saying they could be subject to reprisals. The film-makers however suspect that the EU might also be motivated by its sensitive relationship with Afghan justice institutions.","Gulnaz was convicted of adultery because she had sex outside of marriage by being raped .

"A Marine who lost most of his jaw and an eye after fearlessly shielding a comrade from a grenade blast in Afghanistan will receive the Medal of Honor next month. Retired Corporal William 'Kyle' Carpenter, 24, will receive the nation's top military award at a White House ceremony on June 19, becoming the eighth living recipient for actions in Afghanistan or Iraq. President Obama will present the medal to Carpenter, who is from Flowood, Mississippi. He was just 21 when he intentionally . threw his body over a grenade to save his friend, Lance Cpl. Nicholas . Eufrazio, while they stood guard on a rooftop in the Helmand province in November 2010. Hero: Medically retired Marine Lance Cpl. Kyle Carpenter, pictured earlier this month, will receive the Medal of Honor - the nation's top military award - at a White House ceremony next month . Enemy forces, which had moved in while . hidden by walls from a compound across the street, lobbed three . grenades into the patrol base. One injured an Afghan National Army . soldier, the second did not detonate and the third landed close to Carpenter and Eufrazio. Carpenter, who was working as a machine gunner, placed himself between the . grenade and Eufrazio to shield him. The blast deflected down, with . Carpenter absorbing most of the explosion. 'My last few seconds before I lost consciousness, I had accepted the fact that... I was not going to survive and make it off that rooftop,' he told the Washington Post. But he did survive - although he suffered life-threatening injuries. He lost his right eye and most of the teeth and suffered a broken jaw and arm, which left him heavily scarred. Fighter: Carpenter, who protected a comrade from a grenade blast, lost an eye and most of his jaw . Scars: The 24-year-old's right arm also shattered in dozens of places, leaving him heavily scarred . Ink: He shows off his tattoo, which reads: 'Blessed be the Lord my rock, who trains my hands for war, and my fingers for battle', which is Psalm 144 . Eufrazio also survived the attack but the frontal lobe of his brain was seriously injured by shrapnel and it took him more than two years to be able to talk again. After the blast, Carpenter underwent more than 30 surgeries, including brain surgery, and has been fitted with a glass eye. He spent two-and-a-half years in hospital - but he's not bitter about it. 'I look back and I'm actually very appreciative I had those two and a half years, because those years put things in perspective more than a whole lifetime of things could if I wasn't there,' Carpenter said, according to the Marine Corps. Carpenter was a patient at Walter Reed . National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, until he . medically retired last July. He is now a student at the University of South Carolina. Comrades: Carpenter, pictured left in Afghanistan, threw himself on the grenade to protect Lance Cpl. Nicholas Eufrazio, right, in November 2010. Both men survived but suffered serious injuries . Before: Carpenter is pictured with a dog in Afghanistan before the blast, which left him disfigured . There has been some debate over exactly what happened before the explosion, as Carpenter said he was unable to remember what had happened and there were no witnesses to the event. But troops have said they have no doubt Carpenter had acted to save his friends life. Hospitalman 3rd Class Christopher Frend, who was the first to treat the men, said the injuries were consistent with Carpenter covering the grenade. He added that the part of the grenade that detonated was found beneath Carpenter's torso. 'Grenade blasts blow up; they don't blow down,' Frend told Marine Corps Times in 2012. 'If he hadn't done it, what we found would have looked completely different.' Still, the veteran, who had been in . Afghanistan for five months before the blast, told the Washington Post that he . wasn't comfortable with wearing the Medal of Honor. Battle: Carpenter, 24, lost his right eye and most of his teeth in the blast. He also suffered a shattered jaw . Still smiling: He has undergone 30 surgeries, including on his right arm which broke in numerous places . 'There . are guys who I was with who didn't come back, so it’s hard for me to . wear this and have the spotlight on me the rest of my life when they . lost their life on a hot, dusty field in Afghanistan and most people . don't even know their names,' he said. 'Even . at Walter Reed, I recovered with quadruple-amputees. How am I supposed . to wear this knowing and seeing all the hardships that are much worse . than mine that guys have gone through without any recognition?' Even though he has since left the Marines, Carpenter has maintained close ties with them and has been featured as a guest of honor at several command events. On the anniversary of the blast last year, he wrote on Facebook to thank his supporters. Celebrated: Defense Secretary Leon Panetta is pictured taking scissors from Carpenter to cut the ribbon at the dedication ceremony at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda in 2011 . 'It's hard to comprehend that three years ago today my life and body was torn apart by an enemy hand grenade on a hot dusty rooftop in Afghanistan,' he wrote. 'At times it has felt so long ago and yet, when I close my eyes, I can still feel the warm blood pouring out of me onto my skin and fading out of consciousness with my the final thought of ""I'm going to die"" in my head... And here I am.' The Marine has also been celebrated as a hero across the nation - appearing on Katie Couric's show to talk about his experiences, and garnering thousands of fans on his Facebook page. A formal recommendation for the award must be made within three years of the combat action. So far in his presidency, Obama has presented the medal of honor to 39 members of the armed services.","Kyle Carpenter shielded his friend from the blast on a rooftop in the Helmand province in November 2010 - and both men survived .

"A body has been found in the hunt for missing student Hannah Graham, the University of Virginia student who went missing more than a month ago. Officers uncovered human remains in Albermarle County, just south of Charlottesville, where Hannah, 18, went missing. The find was made around an abandoned property on a rural road - the area where suspect Jesse Matthew, who has been charged with Hannah's abduction, grew up. The identity of the remains has not yet been confirmed - but officers have called off all other search efforts for Hannah in the meantime. Scroll down for video . Missing: Hannah Graham disappeared in Charlottesville, Virginia, on September 13 . Vanished: Witnesses saw Hannah walking with suspect Jesse Matthew after leaving an off-campus party . Rural woodland: The image above shows the area around which the remains are thought to have been found . Roadblock: Officers closed off the road to the site where Hannah's body was found in Albermarle County . Close: Hannah Graham disappeared one month ago during a night out in Charlottesville, Virginia, after becoming lost in the early hours of the morning . In a press conference this evening, Chief Timothy Longo, Charlottesville police told reporters about the discovery - but said there would be no further detail until tests have taken place. Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr, 32, has been arrested charged with abduction with intent to defile. The sophomore was last seen on a surveillance video walking with kidnapping suspect Jesse Matthew in downtown mall in Charlottesville, Virginia on September 13. He said: 'Sometime before noon today a search team from the Chesterfield County Sheriff's department discovered what appears to be human remains. 'Forensic tests need to be conducted to determine the identity of these remains. But we wanted to be quick in informing the Graham family. Suspect: Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr., 32, has been charged with abduction with intent to defile . Graham family: Hannah's mother and father (front and back right) had recently released a fresh plea for people to look for her . Plea: Sue and John Graham, pictured in a video statement earlier this month, pleaded with people who live in Charlottesville or another county nearby to check their propery for any signs of their daughter . 'Unprecedented': Police officers praised the efforts of searchers, who have been looking for Hannah for the past five weeks . Extensive: Search parties scoured the area around Charlottesville, VA, before finding her around ten miles from where she disappeared . 'This investigation is complicated, it's a complex criminal investigation, it is unlikely that we will have any more information in the near future.' Describing the 'unprecedented' search effort, he said: 'It was 35 days ago since University of Virginia student Hannah Graham disappeared from our downtown pedestrian mall. He added: 'Thousand of hours have been spent by hundreds of law enforcement and civilian volunteers in an effort to find Hannah.' It came days after Sue and John Graham, Hannah's parents, issued a last, passionate plea for Virginians to look out for signs of her. Writing on October 13 - a month after she vanished - they said: 'It is heart-breaking for us that the person or persons who know where Hannah is have not come forward with that information. 'It is within their power both to end this nightmare for all, and to relieve the searchers of their arduous task.' Last sighting: Hannah, seen left, was spotted with Matthew on the night she disappeared - she is pictured above just before 1am . Emotion: Charlottesville Police Chief Tim Longo is overcome with emotional at a press conference announcing the discovery of human remains . Witnesses have said they saw Matthew with Hannah on the night she disappeared. The spot at which the human remains were found, on Old Lynchburg Road in Albermarle County, is not far from where Matthew's mother used to live. He is said to have grown up in the area and to be familiar with it. Virginia State Police have said Matthew's arrest provided a 'forensic link' to the 2009 unsolved murder of Morgan Harrington, a 20-year-old who also went missing from Charlottesville. Link: Police have said DNA evidence connects Hannah's disappearance with that of Morgan Harrington, another student in Virginia who went missing . Concert: Morgan, 20, who was at Virginia Tech, disappeared after going to a Metallica concert in 2009 . Morgan, a student at Virginia Tech, disappeared on October 17 2009 in Charlottesville. Her body was found only a few miles from where the discovery today was made. She had been at a Metallica concert in Charlottesville, but was separated from her friends and left outside of the arena. Witnesses saw her trying to hitch-hike home. Her body was eventually found, more than 100 days after she went missing. Until Matthew was linked to the disappearance, no leads as to who may have taken her had been found. Matthew has never been charged in connection with Morgan, but it was recently revealed that police questioned him - but then let him go. It is now a month since our precious daughter Hannah disappeared. We would again like to express our thanks to Chief Longo, Mark Eggeman, their teams, and all of the wonderful people who have dedicated so much of their time to help search for Hannah. Words cannot adequately express our gratitude to them, and to the many others who have provided us with support throughout this ordeal. We truly appreciate the enormous effort that is being made to find Hannah. It is heart-breaking for us that the person or persons who know where Hannah is have not come forward with that information. It is within their power both to end this nightmare for all, and to relieve the searchers of their arduous task. Again, we would like to urge anyone who has not already searched their property in the city of Charlottesville, or any of the neighboring counties, to please do so today. Please, please, please help us to bring Hannah home. Thank you. John and Sue Graham .","Hannah Graham, 18, went missing on September 13 in Charlottesville, VA .

"Prince Philip: The Duke of Edinburgh attended a garden party at Buckingham Palace yesterday . Prince Philip was admitted to hospital last night for an operation after suffering abdominal pain. Tests have revealed the 91-year-old requires exploratory surgery under general anaesthetic. Despite the health fears, he carried out seven public engagements this week including a naval visit, two dinners and Tuesday’s high-profile service to mark the 60th anniversary of the Queen’s coronation. Philip even attended yesterday’s garden party for 8,000 at Buckingham Palace and spent the afternoon cracking jokes with guests. He left the event at around 5.30pm, changed out of his morning suit and was driven to the London Clinic, a private hospital on Harley Street. He is expected to have surgery today and is likely to be in hospital for up to two weeks. His 92nd birthday is on Monday. It came as The Queen visited Broadcasting House today without her husband to officially open it after £1billion of work was carried out. Prime Minister David Cameron said Prince Philip was held in the 'highest esteem' and said the whole of Britain would be 'wishing him well'. The prince has cancelled two engagements over the past week – a lecture at Windsor Castle and a reception at Buckingham Palace – but aides said this was not due to his abdominal pain. A royal source told the Mail: ‘The Duke underwent abdominal tests last week and was told a few days ago that he needed to have an exploratory operation. Scroll down for videos . Guards: Police stand outside The London Clinic this morning, where Prince Philip has been brought for an operation . Hot day: The Duke exchanged words with the Queen in the afternoon heat during the Palace garden party . Together: Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip arrive to attend a garden party yesterday at the Palace . ‘He has been feeling under the weather in recent days but that is because he had lost his voice. The two are quite unconnected. ‘He was admitted to hospital by . arrangement and left quite calmly – and without any panic – after today’s garden party, where he was on top form.’ The situation prompts further questions about the Duke of Edinburgh’s workload and that of the Queen. Treatment: The Duke of Edinburgh has been admitted to the private London Clinic where he will undergo an exploratory operation on his abdomen . A few weeks ago, Buckingham Palace . announced the pair would be scaling back on their long-haul foreign . travel, leaving it largely to younger royals. The Mail also revealed that high-level . talks had been taking place between Buckingham Palace, Clarence House . and Downing Street for Prince Charles to take an even more prominent . role. It will also put pressure on the Duke . and Duchess of Cambridge – who are expecting their first baby – to . become full-time working royals. All smiles: The Queen presents the Duke with New Zealand's highest honour, the Order of New Zealand, in the presence of Sir Lockwood Smith, High Commissioner for New Zealand, at Buckingham Palace yesterday . Prince William is due to leave his . role as an RAF search and rescue pilot in September and is expected . within weeks to announce what he intends to do next. He had been . expected to take up a further military post that would give him more . opportunity to undertake royal engagements. 'He was admitted to hospital by arrangement and left quite calmly – and without any panic – after today’s garden party, where he was on top form' Royal source . However pressure is now sure . to mount on him to leave the forces completely and take the strain off . his elderly grandparents. The Duke’s admittance to the clinic . comes almost a year to the day that he was hospitalised with a serious . bladder infection during the diamond jubilee celebrations. At yesterday’s garden party, the Queen . and Prince Philip appeared together on the steps of the palace at 4pm, . when the national anthem was played. Despite the fierce sun, with . temperatures of around 22C (72F), the Duke appeared relaxed and happily . chatted to guests as he walked around the garden. Lord Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire Sir . John Peace was introduced to the Queen and the duke as they made their . way through the gardens. He said: ‘It was wonderful to see the Duke of . Edinburgh with her.’ Earlier this week: Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh attended a service at Westminster Abbey in central London on Tuesday to mark the 60th anniversary of the Queen's coronation . Sir John said the prince had been ‘telling jokes’ – . but would not divulge what they were about. With a two week stay, it's likely the Duke Of Edinburgh will undergo a series of tests. GP Dr Arun Ghosh told MailOnline that an exploratory operation of the abdomen would usually suggest a laparoscopy - keyhole surgery to access and examine the inside of the abdomen and pelvis. This provides a much more detailed view of what is going on inside the body than techniques such as ultrasound. A laparoscopy is not used to diagnose cancer. The procedure is often used to investigate what appears to be an obstruction, most commonly a twisted bowel, where the natural shape of the intestines has changed or a section of the intestines has overlapped. It is a condition more common with age. General aesthetics can cause serious side-effects and the risks are far higher in elderly patients. At worst they include cardiac arrest, breathing problems and brain damage - but these are very rare and less serious complications include nausea, headaches and temporary confusion. Prince Philip’s doctors will have carefully weighed up these risks before deciding to carry out the operation. The Duke of Edinburgh's latest bout of ill health comes after a series of recent health complications. He was taken into hospital in Aberdeen in August after being admitted with a recurrence of the bladder infection he suffered in June. The Duke spent almost a week in hospital after falling ill with the infection during the Diamond Jubilee. It was the third time in nine months the Duke has been in hospital. In 2011, he spent Christmas at Papworth Hospital in Cambridge after suffering chest pains. He underwent surgery for a blocked coronary artery, for which he had a stent fitted. On Wednesday, the day before he was . admitted to hospital, Philip visited the SS Robin, the world’s oldest . complete steamship, at Royal Victoria Dock and in the evening held a . dinner at Buckingham Palace for the Duke of Edinburgh’s Award world . fellowship. On Tuesday he was present at the . Westminster Abbey celebrations to mark the anniversary of the Queen’s . Coronation and in the evening he attended a dinner of the Corporation of . Trinity House, the body overseeing the country’s lighthouses. Before yesterday’s garden party, the . Queen invested Philip with New Zealand’s highest honour at a . presentation at Buckingham Palace, making him an additional member of . the Order of New Zealand to mark the diamond jubilee. The Duke will not be able to accompany . her to open the BBC’s new £1billion home at Broadcasting House today . and she will perform the engagement as planned. On Wednesday, Peter Phillips spoke of his grandfather’s health during a TV interview. He said: ‘You have got to remember his . age, both of their ages, you know ... what they do at their age – they . do a lot more than most other pensioners of their equivalent age. ‘If occasionally there is the odd engagement cancelled, it shouldn’t come as such a surprise, given the workload.’ The Queen has made clear that her husband’s devotion and support has been crucial to the success of her reign. Last year she became the first British monarch to celebrate a 65th wedding anniversary. The Queen and Philip first met in 1939 . when she was just 13 and he was a cadet asked to entertain George VI’s . daughters at Dartmouth Naval College. In a speech to mark their golden . wedding anniversary in 1997, the Duke said of their marriage: ‘The main . lesson we’ve learned is that tolerance is the one central ingredient of . any happy marriage. It might not be so important when things are going well but it is absolutely vital when things get difficult.’","Prince Philip is being treated at the London Clinic on Harley Street .

"A primary school with more than 400 pupils has become the first in the country where no children speak English as their mother tongue. Punjabi Urdu, Portuguese, Czech, Polish, Russian and several African dialects are among the 20 foreign languages spoken at Gladstone Primary School. But it has thrived in the face of adversity. Only 14 months ago the school was rated ‘inadequate’ by Ofsted, the lowest of four ratings. Last month it was upgraded to ‘good’, the second highest. Lesson in diversity: Christine Parker with some of her pupils, who between them speak 20 foreign languages . Gladstone Primary School headteacher Christine Parker chats with her pupils. She oversees what is the most multi-cultural school in Britain, with not one of the 440 pupils listing English as their first language . The school, in Peterborough, has . adopted a string of measures to cope. Teachers give ‘running . commentaries’, explaining everything they are doing so that pupils . associate objects and actions with the words that describe them. A ‘buddy system’ is also in place with . children in schools over the border in Lincolnshire so that pupils can . benefit from having friends who are native English speakers. Pupils . study and play together at each other’s schools once a fortnight. Teachers are motivated by salaries . that are linked to their performance, something Education Secretary . Michael Gove is introducing across the country from September in an . attempt to drive up standards. Gladstone Primary is believed to be the first in Britain where every single one of its pupils does not speak English as a first language, but more and more pupils across the country are now from foreign backgrounds. In a 2012 census of 1,600 schools, it was found English-speaking children are now in a minority, with the figures particularly startling in the 14 inner London boroughs, where there were 98,000 non-native English speakers compared to 78,000 who could list the language as their number one. Nationwide, there were 97 schools where the number of pupils speaking English as a mother tongue was fewer than one in 20 of the school population. After London, Birmingham had the highest concentration of 'foreign' pupils, followed by Bradford and then Leicester. Punjabi was the most widely-spoken first language. Head Christine Parker, 54, said: ‘More . and more of the world is  going bilingual. The culture at our school is . not to see bilingualism as  a difficulty.’ Often, she added, it is preferable for . children to speak no English  at all, rather than turn up with a . mixture of English and their parents’ language. ‘Sometimes parents have tried to help . their children learn English but their own isn’t too good,’ she said. ‘The outcome is the children aren’t fluent in their own language. If . they haven’t got a good foundation [in their own language] it can be . very difficult to build on that.’ Some 358 of the 440 pupils were raised . speaking Punjabi Urdu, according to Department for Education figures. The language is used in parts of Pakistan and India. Another 23 are fluent in Dari, which . is used in Afghanistan, Iran and Tajikistan. There are 15 Lithuanians . and 11 Latvians, while other languages include Portuguese, Polish, . Slovakian, Czech, Gujarati, Russian, German, Pashto, French, Arabic and . four African dialects. The different language groups are . accommodated using 28 teaching assistants, ten of whom speak Urdu.Mrs . Parker, who speaks some Urdu after living in Pakistan with her teacher . husband Stephen in the 1990s plus some French and German, said: ‘Some . children like to start trying out what they have learned straight away. ‘Others have a silent period of  up to . six months while they are taking things in. Then they start to  talk . with some fluency. It’s lovely  to hear.’ Beeches Primary School, which is also . in Peterborough, has 23 native languages spoken among its 592 pupils. Only 24 children have English as a first language. Despite the language barrier, Gladstone Primary School has been rated 'good' by inspectors just a year after it was deemed 'inadequate' Several nationalities migrated to . Peterborough in the last century, including Pakistanis and Italians. The . city also saw a huge influx of Eastern Europeans from 2004 when the EU . expanded and is now believed to be the fastest growing multi-ethnic . community in Britain. By 2007 there were 16,000 Eastern . Europeans estimated to be living there, one in ten of the population. Many of them arrived to work on farms and in food processing plants in . the agricultural heartland. Peterborough City Council said more . than 100 languages are spoken in the area. More than a third of pupils . speak English as a second language, up from one in five in 2008. The city’s Conservative MP, Stewart Jackson, has warned that it is struggling to cope with the new arrivals. More are expected as families leave London because of the Government’s cap on housing benefits.","Gladstone Primary School in Peterborough most multi-cultural in Britain .

"Federal agents this week searched the Florida home of a 'doomsday prepper' they alleged had stockpiled over 50 high-powered assault rifles and several explosive devices buried around his property as 'booby traps'. However the warrant showed up little more than barrels of food. Martin Winters, a father-of-three from Valrico, surrendered to police on Wednesday following a widespread two-day hunt. Investigators had claimed the 55-year-old was preparing for 'an end-of-times event as prophesied by the Book of Revelations', according to ABC News. False alarm? Agents went to the Valrico property of Martin Winters looking for as many as 50 high-powered AR-15 rifles and several explosive devices, but found only buried barrels of food . Raid: Federal agents exact a search warrant on the home of alleged 'doomsday prepper' Martin Winters in Valrico, Florida . Martin Winters allegedly told an undercover agent he had built illegal weapons, along with concerning comments about how he was going to use them . According to a federal affidavit, Winters was part of a group called the River Otter Preppers and had a plan to kill government agents 'if necessary'. Winters allegedly told an undercover agent he had 50 AR-15 rifles buried on his property and other properties. The agent also said Winters told him he wanted to burn his house down and then shoot agents as they arrived to the scene, and that he had set up bombs as booby traps. Winters had been under government surveillance since October, after he was indicted on four counts of building destructive devices. Winters also said he had at least 40 men that were willing to participate in his 'last stand', officials said. But in federal court on Wednesday, Winters' defense attorney, Ellis Faught, said the confidential informant's estimates were wide of the mark. The informant had bought four so-called destructive devices from Winters, but they were not buried as booby traps. Five guns were found locked in a safe, according to 10 News. Martin Winters had been under government surveillance since October, after being arrested on explosives charges . The FBI alleged that Martin and others had been stockpiling arms and also set traps on his property. According to the FBI, he was attached to a doomsday group preparing for 'an end-of-times event as prophesied by the Book of Revelations' 'None of this was there,' Fraught told the court, the station reported. 'And it's my understanding that no guns were dug up. 'It was alleged by the government that there were 50 to 60 guns and I'm only aware of five of them that were found and they were found in his house in a safe.' The FBI have not formally released what they found in the search and could present new evidence in their case against Winters. Winters' daughters said in an interview with 10 News that their father was not 'extremely dangerous', as authorities had claimed. 'We knew he wouldn't hurt anyone. We knew he wouldn't put anyone else in jeopardy,' the daughters said. Amy Cason - one of Martin Winters' daughters and pictured here with her father - says he never intended to hurt anyone . They added that what is buried on the property is dozens of barrels of food. 'He is just preparing if days were to come where there was no grocery store and you had to have food and you couldn't go get it,' said Winters' youngest daughter, Tracie. 'It's not like he's preparing to hurt anyone ever. That's not his intentions.' Winters will remain in jail until his next court appearance on July 17. br/> .","Martin Winters, 55, of Valrico, Florida, had been under government surveillance since October .

"Republicans are now tied with Democrats among women voters, a new poll shows, introducing a surprising twist into the midterm elections. Women have long been an essential component of the Democratic Party's base, and the party's declaration that the GOP is at war with women has gone a long way to set back the opposing political party with female voters. An Associated Press-GfK poll released on Tuesday has 44 percent of women choosing the Republican Party to lead Congress while 42 percent stuck by the Democratic Party. Milwaukee elections worker Claudette Holloway points voters to the polls on the first day of early, in-person voting in Wisconsin on Monday. Wisconsin is one of a handful of states that has already opened it's polls for midterm election voting . Women now say they'd like to see Republicans win control of Congress in the midterm elections. This represents a significant shift in voting patterns of women, who traditionally favor the Democratic Party. Just last month Democrats led Republicans among women by seven points . That's a significant shift from just a month ago when Democrats led Republicans 47-40 among women voters. Republican National Committee Press Secretary Kirsten Kukowski told MailOnline in an email that the GOP's efforts to appeal to female voters with policies that cut across gender are proving successful. 'Women are sick and tired of being talked down to and treated like single issue voters by the Democrat Party,' Kukowski said. 'Unlike what Cosmo and the Democrats might think, we care about more than reproductive rights, we want a strong economy, strong national defense and for everyone to have a shot at their American dream. Enough is enough and this poll reflects that.' Republicans have struggled to gain ground with women ever since former Missouri Rep. Todd Akin suggested in 2012 that rape rarely leads to pregnancy. 'If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down,' Akin, the GOP's nominee for the Senate in Missouri, claimed. The 'legitimate rape' incident, as it's now called, became a plague upon the Republican Party that year. A question about Akin's remarks took down the GOP's nominee to the Senate in Nebraska, state Treasurer Richard Mourdock, as well. Democrats also used the GOP's opposition to the president's health care law against candidates, claiming it was evidence that Republicans don't care about women's health. The health care law mandates that insurance companies cover contraception and preventative health services for women. It also bars insurance providers from declining Americans for coverage based on pre-existing conditions like pregnancy. Republicans want to repeal the entire health care law and start from scratch. While they're not necessarily against requiring insurance companies to cover health screenings for women they believe that contraception coverage is a violation of businesses' religious liberties. The GOP's position on the issue was construed in 2012 to mean that they were against access to contraception for women, and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney lost women to Barack Obama by 11 points as a result. Since then, Democrats have made Republicans' refusal to pass legislation mandating that businesses pay their female employees the same amount as their male counterparts the centerpiece of their argument against the GOP when courting women voters. Barack Obama trounced Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election, thanks in part, to women voters . In response to the AP poll, the Democratic National Committee told MailOnline on Wednesday that 'in governors races and senate races across the country we are seeing leads for Democrats with women voters and that's because our candidates have had their back.' 'From equal pay to access to health care, there's no question Democrats have supported the interests of women and families while Republicans have worked to obstruct progress,' DNC Deputy Communications Director Lily Adams said. The DNC pointed to the Iowa Senate race as an example of how individual Democratic candidates are outpacing their Republican challengers with women. There, Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley is winning women by 14 points despite the fact that the GOP contender, state senator Joni Ernst, is a woman, a poll issued by theDes Moines Register earlier this month shows. The survey notably shows Braley losing male voters by 16 points, however, and losing the race to Ernst by a single digit. A Quinnipiac University poll taken a week later showed the same trend, with Ernst up by two overall and 18 points among men. Braley led among women in the poll 52-39. The Associated Press discovered in its generic ballot test, which looks at parties, not candidates, this month that Americans nationwide prefer Democrats to lead Congress over Republicans by two points. When the pool of respondents is winnowed down to just those who are considered likely to vote in the Nov. 4 elections, the pendulum shifts the other way, however. In that version of the poll, Republicans had a double-digit to lead over Democrats to win control of Congress. Likely voters told AP's pollsters that they favor Republicans, 47 percent, to Democrats, 39 percent, to run the legislative branch.","A poll released yesterday has 44 percent of women choosing the Republican Party to lead Congress; 42 percent stuck by the Democratic Party .

"President Barack Obama's affinity for Abraham Lincoln was on display through his political rise, but he won't be on hand to mark one of the 16th president's signature moments. Obama has refused to attend the 150th anniversary of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address in Pennsylvania on November 19. His decision, which has not been explained, has infuriated local media. No show: U.S. President Barack Obama President has snubbed the historic Gettysburg 150th anniversary ceremony on November 19 . U.S. Secretary of the Interior Sally . Jewell will represent the administration, sharing keynote speaker status . with historian James McPherson. Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett also plans to attend the ceremony. Newspapers in the Keystone State, which Obama carried in both the 2008 and 2012 elections, have taken the president to task, according to News Max. Local officials had planned for a possible presidential visit for months. 'For a president who has so demonstrably associated himself with Lincoln — the heir of Lincoln's policies who announced his candidacy from the steps of the Old State Capitol in Springfield and used the Lincoln Bible (twice) at his inauguration — this is nothing less than a profile in cowardice,' Donald Gilliland of Patriot News in the state capital of Harrisburg wrote. 'How . could he not pay his respects to those whose ultimate sacrifices that . made his presidency possible?' read an editorial in the York Daily . Record. 'How could he not visit and acknowledge the new birth of freedom that is his — and our nation's inheritance of that battle? 'Symbolism . matters. President Obama could have used this occasion to offer words . of healing and reconciliation — as his Illinois forefather once did. Instead he is sending us a little-known Cabinet member to do the job of . a president, of a statesman, of an orator. Unacceptable.' Historic: The 150th anniversary celebration of Abraham Lincoln's historic Gettysburg Address falls on November 19 . Like Lincoln, Obama came to national . prominence through the politics of Illinois, where they both once served . in the Legislature. Obama . began his presidential campaign in Springfield, Illinois, a town with . deep ties to Lincoln; traced Lincoln's 1861 train route in coming to . Washington and even took the oath of office on Lincoln's Bible. For . months, planners had held out hope that Obama would be at Soldier's . National Cemetery for the reading of the famous oration, first delivered . on November 19, 1863, more than four months after the Civil War's . pivotal battle. More than 3,500 Union soldiers killed in the Battle of Gettysburg are buried there. McPherson, a top Civil War historian who won the Pulitzer for 'Battle Cry of Freedom', said he was surprised by Obama's decision. 'I thought he would probably come. He identifies with Lincoln and knows a great deal about him,' McPherson said. 'It might have been an opportunity for him to say something important, maybe enhance a tarnished image. He's going through a rough patch right now.' Obama, the nation's first black president, has said he feels a 'special gratitude' to Lincoln, who led the fight to end slavery in the United States. White House press secretary Jay Carney refused to comment on Obama's decision. 'I think that is an enormously significant event in our history, and I think Americans will take the appropriate time to consider the speech that was delivered there. I would simply say that I have no updates on the president’s schedule,' he said, according to The Washington Times. 'I think all Americans will share and marvel in the remembrance of that important date in our history.'","Barack Obama will not attend the 150th anniversary celebration of Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address on November 19 .

"Bigger is better for car passenger safety claims a new study that has identified the Fiat 500 as the most dangerous car to have a crash in. The American research shows that the sub-compact car has the highest insurance rates for policies that pay for injuries to passengers in an accident. It claims that even though small cars like the Fiat can score well in crash tests, the sheer size of bigger vehicles will ultimately better protect passengers from injuries. Drive safely: The Fiat 500, pictured in a crash test carried out by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, has the highest rates for U.S. motor insurance policies which cover crash injuries to passengers . An IIHS Top Safety Pick: But an expert from the organisation nevertheless warned drivers to avoid the smallest cars if passenger safety is their priority, since bigger vehicles offer more protection . 'If safety is a priority, you should avoid the smallest cars,' said Russ Rader, spokesman for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). 'The laws of physics are always in play in crashes. Weight counts. 'Smaller, lighter cars are safer than they used to be, but all things being equal, people riding in bigger, heavier vehicles get more protection in crashes.' In a head-on crash, the vehicle that is heavier will drive the lighter one backward, increasing crash forces for the people in the lighter car and reducing forces for those in the heavier one, said Mr Rader. He added: 'Smaller cars also have less crush space in front to manage the energy of a crash and help ""cushion"" the occupants as the vehicle comes to a stop.' Safest choice: The GMC Sierra 1500 during a crash test. In a head-on crash, heavier vehicles drive lighters one back, increasing forces for the people in the lighter car and reducing forces for those in the heavier one . The research by Insure.com, a U.S. insurance price comparison website, analysed rates for Personal Injury Protection (PIP) and Medical Payments (MedPay) policies, which cover payouts to injured passengers. Using insurance rates for more than 750 vehicles in our annual car insurance comparison study, the study picked out the vehicles with the lowest and highest costs for PIP and MedPay coverage. The Fiat 500 has good crash test ratings and it is an IIHS Top Safety Pick, but these insurance costs, based on the amounts of claims made, should reflect the real-world safety of the vehicle. The way they are driven also effects the figures, however. Top of the list of safest vehicles was the U.S.-made GMC Sierra 1500 pick-up truck. Vehicles from the General Motors truck marque filled four spots in the list of the top five safest. 'Italian design proves to be no match for American brawn when it comes to passenger safety,' the research noted.","Italian-designed car has highest rate for passenger injury insurance .

"The Queen shared a joke with Stephen Hawking at a charity event as they mingled at an event to honour one of the country's leading charities for the disabled. The monarch and world-famous scientist were among the stars who gathered in St James's Palace at a reception paying tribute to the work of Leonard Cheshire Disability, which was founded by an RAF pilot in 1948. When the two met, the Queen said: 'Have you still got that American voice? - to which Professor Hawking replied 'Yes, it is copyrighted actually'. Scroll down for video .

Science of success: Professor Hawking has been busy lately, yesterday unveiling light-hearted 'formulae' to help England clinch World Cup victory .

The charity's boss Claire Pelham said she was overwhelmed by the interest the Queen showed in their work. Patron: The Queen has lent her name to Leonard Cheshire Disability since she became patron in 1980 . She said: 'It is a huge honour to meet the Queen. I was absolutely amazed at how long she spent with every person - she didn't just whizz past people. 'I know she has always closely followed what we do. 'I do think Leonard would be proud of what we are doing if he was alive today. He was a radical. 'When he started this charity disabled people were locked up in hospital out of sight and he was absolutely not OK with that. 'He had fought alongside people in the war who were now disabled people and he wasn't prepared to accept that they should be locked up in a hospital while he lived a full life. 'That was his vision, that is our vision and we are determined to get it.' The organisation was founded by RAF . pilot Leonard Cheshire in 1948 after he witnessed the . Nagasaki nuclear attack.

"Passengers traveling on a Delta flight from Atlanta to Los Angeles learned their plane was carrying some very special cargo as they neared the end of their journey. Around 40 minutes before their aircraft came into land, they were informed by the pilot that their plane was delivering the body of a fallen soldier back to his family. John E. DiScala wrote on his travel site JohnnyJet.com the pilot told passengers the flight would be greeted by a group of fire trucks and a water cannon salute. 'The water glistening on the window panes looked like tears,' he wrote in an emotionally charged blog. Scroll down for video...

Salute: A water cannon salute from LAX fire trucks welcomed the flight into the terminal . Poetic: Johnny Discala who writes a travel blog wrote 'The water glistening on the window panes looked like tears.' Duties: Every military branch has its own honor guard, usually military in nature. One of the primary roles for honor guards is to provide funeral honors for fallen comrades . 'Passengers in the airport must have been worried when they saw our plane pull into the gate, as we had a full police and fire escort, front and back. I was on the left side of the plane and later realized that the family could be seen off to the right, standing with the United States Army Honor Guard,' Mr Discala wrote. Every military branch has its own honor guard, usually military in nature, and is composed of volunteers who are carefully screened. One of the primary roles for honor guards is to provide funeral honors for fallen comrades. An honor: A military soldier came on board to thank the passengers for bringing home the body to the family of the fallen . A difference in mood: Passengers stood to pay their respects instead of rushing off to collect their bags of join the taxi rank . Soon after the flight had touched down, a military officer stepped on board and addressed the passengers. 'It is a sworn oath to bring home to the family the fallen,' the officer said. 'Today, you all did that. You are all escorts, escorts of the heart.' Mr Discala wrote the mood on the plane was drastically different from anything else he'd ever encountered. 'Everyone was silent, no one got up, not even that person from the back row who pretends they don’t speak English so they can be first off the plane. I’m sure most had meteor-sized lumps in their throats and tears in their eyes like I did.' After passengers disembarked, instead of them rushing to make a connection or head for the baggage claim, a group gathered by the window overlooking the gate. 'They witnessed something truly moving,' Mr DiScala wrote. An American flag-draped coffin was unloaded from the plane in front of the soldier’s family. 'To see the Honor Guard and family waiting patiently, while LAX baggage handlers and a military loadmaster remove the flag covered casket first from the cargo hold, was humbling to say the least,' he contemplates. Mr DiScala noticed a woman whom he believed to be the soldier’s mother stepping away from a crowd of relatives huddled in blankets and walk towards the casket. 'As soon as I saw her reach out to put her hand on her baby’s casket, I walked away,' he wrote.","Passengers were told just before landing that they plane was carrying the body of a fallen soldier .

"A woman whose father, a black slave, fought on the Confederate side in the Civil War alongside his master was buried today, more than 150 years after the conflict began. Mattie Clyburn Rice, 91, died last month. Her father was Weary Clyburn, a slave from South Carolina who followed his master to war and saved his life. He fathered Rice in 1922, when he was 82, and survived until his daughter was eight years old. Funeral: Mattie Clyburn Rice, 91, was buried in Monroe, North Carolina today - in the same spot her Civil War veteran father was laid to rest. A Confederate 'Black Rose' mourner is seen by the grave . In life: Rice, bottom center, is pictured in 2012 with other members of the Order of the Black Rose. She pressured Union County, North Carolina, into recognizing her father and other black Civil War fighters . Civil War re-enactors gathered for the ceremony in Monroe, North Carolina.Veterans' organizations such as the Daughters of the Confederacy - of which Rice was a member - also attended. Records from the early 20th Century recount how he saved the life of his master, Frank Clyburn, whom he served as a bodyguard. He is also recorded as having done personal service for Robert E. Lee, the famed leader of the Confederate military. Heritage: Weary Clyburn, Rice's father, was 72 when she was born in 1922. Rice lived to 91 . Old-time uniform: Confederate re-enactors attended the funeral in recognition of Rice's historical efforts . The records recount how, when his master was wounded fighting over a crucial port in South Carolina, he slung him over his shoulder and carried him to safety under intense enemy fire. The near-death encounter came at Hilton Head, South Carolina - a vital port which was blockaded by Union forces and eventually fell in November 1861. Place in history: Weary Clyburn did personal service to Confederate general Robert E. Lee . Cutting off naval traffic to key routes such as Hilton Head, Charleston and Savannah were a vital part of crippling the South's economy and bringing the Confederate war effort to a halt. However, despite his presence in the theater of war, Clyburn - along with all other blacks - was not eligible to be recognized as a Confederate soldier. Clyburn, who was just 19 when he went to war, continued to draw his war pension until 1922 - but because he could not counted as a soldier, received a smaller amount than whites who fought. When Cyburn - referred to locally as 'Uncle Weary Clyburn' - died in 1930, his race also prevented his pension from being transferred to his widow. The Charlotte Observer reported that during her life Rice fought for recognition of black people who were involved in the Civil War. She helped pressure Union County, North Carolina, to recognize the service of her father, eight other black slaves and one black free man. The authority agreed and in 2012 established a plaque at their courthouse in their honor - the only such marker in the United States. 'She absolutely adored her father and she wanted his story told,' her daughter, Valeria Hall Frazier, told reporters. 'She wanted so much for that (marker) to happen.' In an interview last year, Rice recalled hearing stories of the war when she was growing up - which sparked a curiosity to find out more about the war. Fighters: Weary Clyburn helped get his master - Frank Clyburn - away from enemy fire at Hilton Head. Above is a representation of the 1861 battle of Bull Run, a Confederate victory . Southern forces: Pictured above are Confederate troops in 1863 . She said: 'I couldn’t figure out why they were slaves and why they had to do all this fighting. 'I said to myself that if I ever get old enough and have enough money, I’m going to find out where these people went and what they did.' In the ceremony today, Rice's ashes were interred in the same plot where her father was buried. Over his grave flies the original Confederate 'Stars and Bars' flag as it appeared when the Confederacy was seven states, alongside the flag of South Carolina.","Mattie Clyburn Rice, 91,was buried today in Monroe, North Carolina .

"They are seven simple words we all take for granted. But as Joanne Milne heard her doctor recite the days of the week, she was overwhelmed with emotion, fighting back tears and gasping to catch her breath.

Last month the 40-year-old underwent an operation to have cochlear implants fitted (pictured) But last month Ms Milne underwent a life-changing operation to fit cochlear implants. Following the procedure, she faced a four-week wait for medics to switch on the implants to see if the operation had been a success. Hearing for first time, a video capturing the switch-on shows Ms Milne breaking down as she tells her doctor her own voice sounds 'very, very strange', before adding: 'Wow, it is absolutely amazing.'

The hearing loss is sensori-neural deafness - a problem with the inner ear or the auditory nerve. A person diagnosed with Usher Syndrome will usually suffering hearing loss from birth.

Listener Ingrid Bronsgeest said: 'You do bring some magic to peoples lives @BBC6Music that #MemoryTape story is amazing. Sooo emotional but happy tears too.x' A cochlear implant is a small electronic device that can help provide a sense of sound to a person who is deaf or severely hard of hearing. An external portion of the implants sits behind the ear, while a second part is surgically placed under the skin. The implants cannot restore normal hearing but they can give a deaf person a good representation of sounds, helping them understand speech. Surgery: The small electronic device consists of two parts, the external section sits behind the ear while a second part is surgically fitted under the skin . Whereas hearing aids amplify sound so they can be detected by damaged ears, cochlear implants bypass damaged parts of the ear and directly stimulate the auditory nerve. Signals generated by the implant are sent via the auditory nerve to the brain, which recognises the signals as sound. Hearing through an implant is different from normal hearing and takes time to get used to it. It allows people to recognise warning signals, understand their environment and enjoy conversations with people. According to the Food and Drug Administration, as of December 2012, around 324,200 people worldwide have been fitted with implants. In the UK The Ear Foundation estimates about 10,000 people have cochlear implants and the number is growing every year.","Joanne Milne suffers the rare condition Usher Syndrome .

"The makers of the film Dallas Buyers Club are hunting Australians who downloaded or shared the movie illegally. They have filed a discovery order in the Federal Court in a bid to get names and contact details from five Australian telecommunication companies, including iiNet, Internode, Dodo, Amnet and Adam Internet. Discovery orders are used in cases where the identity of the person or company targeted for legal action is unknown. Dallas Buyers Club makers have filed a discovery order in the Federal Court . iiNet has opposed the application by Dallas Buyers Club LLC, citing 'serious concerns' that the film's makers will look to intimidate subscribers. 'We are concerned that our customers will be unfairly targeted to settle claims out of court using a practice called ""speculative invoicing"",' Steve Dalby, iiNet's chief regulatory officer, told AAP. That strategy involves sending intimidating letters to alleged offenders threatening legal action and seeking large sums of money. It is a tactic copyright holders have used in other countries to clamp down on file-sharing via websites such as BitTorrent. The application comes two years after iiNet won a landmark High Court case against a group of Hollywood movie studios which argued the telecommunication company was responsible for the downloading habits of users. In a unanimous decision, the court held that iiNet could not be found liable because it did not control the sites used by customers. It is a bid to get names and contact details from five Australian telecommunication companies: iiNet, Internode, Dodo, Amnet and Adam Internet . It also comes as the federal government considers a range of proposals to curb illegal downloading by Australians. One key proposal would compel ISPs to block infringing websites. Another would compel telecommunication companies to curb illegal downloads by making it easier for rights holders to take the companies to court. Mr Dalby says a date for a hearing is likely to be set for early 2015.","The makers of the film have filed a discovery order in the Federal Court .

"The Duke of Edinburgh might not normally be thought of as the sort of chap who would take a close interest in his wife’s jewellery. But he seemed particularly taken with the six-petal diamond flower brooch that the Queen wore to the Derby yesterday – and with very good reason. For it was the very same item she wore when she announced her engagement to Prince Philip in 1947. It was her way of paying a highly personal tribute to her consort in the 60th anniversary year of her Coronation – and the gesture did not go unnoticed. Nostalgic: The Duke of Edinburgh spots the Queen's significant brooch, which jogged his memory. It is believed that the Queen has not worn the brooch since her engagement . Sentimental statement: The Queen wore the brooch on the left hand side as she did in 1947. The young couple were married at Westminster Abbey in the same year . The Queen looked happy and relaxed as . she arrived at Epsom wearing a Wedgwood blue hat and matching coat, with . collar and cuffs that had the same design as her dress. The outfit was . topped off with black gloves and a black handbag. Her granddaughters Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice also watched the racing. Beatrice, who famously wore an avant garde head piece nicknamed ‘The Pretzel’ at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011, this time played safer, with a burgundy cloche hat. Favoured pastime: The Queen, a familiar face at all the major dates in the horse-racing calendar, visited Epsom Racecourse in Surrey ahead of the Derby today with her husband the Duke of Edinburgh .

Meanwhile, Westminster Abbey is being . prepared for Tuesday’s service to mark the anniversary of the Queen’s . Coronation in 1953, 16 months after she acceded to the Throne. More . than 2,000 guests including High Commissioners from the Commonwealth, . ambassadors, faith representatives and Armed Forces personnel from every . UK county will attend the service. Sporting event: Princess Beatrice wore a cloche-style hat by milliner Karen Henriksen, and a monochrome dress with a circle print .

The . congregation will also include John Nicholson, who, as a 12-year-old, . sang at the Coronation alongside the Westminster scholars. Their role . was to be the first to acclaim the new Sovereign with ‘Vivat Regina’. The . roses in the posy that the Queen will carry at the service are being . flown 5,500 miles from Colombia – because home-grown buds have been held . back because of the coldest spring in Britain for 50 years. Creamy, . buttermilk-coloured roses, known as Patience, and blushing pink Keira . roses  will feature prominently in the bouquet, which will be presented . to the Queen at the Abbey.

"This is the moment a man is finally liberated of his crippling 132lbs scrotum, thanks to a kind-hearted doctor who agreed to carry out the surgery for free. Wesley Warren Jr, 49, from Las Vegas, suffered from the rare medical condition scrotal lymphedema which saw his scrotum swell to gigantic proportions and left him feeling little more than a freak. His ordeal began when he woke up one . morning five years ago with a shooting pain in his groin, which grew . steadily worse and his scrotum steadily bigger over the next nine . months. Warning graphic content . A team of four physicians begin the procedure to remove Las Vegas man Wesley Warren's 132lbs scrotum . Mr Warren was left barely able to walk and was often subjected to ridicule and abuse when he appeared in public. His . penis was buried so deeply in the abnormal growth that he was forced to . urinate on himself and he was forced to turning hooded sweatshirts upside down and using them as pants. At . one stage he became so desperate he considered selling his testicles on eBay to . pay for an operation to remove them. Surgeons examine Mr Warren's swollen scrotum prior to the surgery which caused his weight to drop by 200lbs . Recovery: Mr Warren is pictured in his hospital bed following the operation which was carried out for free by kind-hearted surgeon Dr Joel Gelman . Mr Warren's scrotum is taken away on a trolley for disposal. At one point he was so desperate he considered selling it on ebay to raise money for an operation . Fortunately, California doctor Dr Joel Gelman  took . pity on Mr Warren and agreed to carry out the 13-hour operation to . remove it for free. The procedure, which was carried out on April 8, saw Dr Gelman and three other . physicians cut away simultaneously on the grossly enlarged protective . sack of skin and muscles that contained Warren's testicles and penis, . according to the Las Vegas Review Journal. The . massive swelling was caused by fluid building up in his scrotum. Doctors . had to remove the excess tissue and then completely rebuild his . scrotum. After: Wesley Warren Jr, left, is shown with Dr Joel Gelman, who led a team of surgeons and nurses in correcting the abnormality that Warren endured for five years . Struggle: Mr Warren uses a wheelchair to cart his vast appendage along a hospital corridor prior to the operation . Despite finally being  relieved of his burden, Mr Warren was initially unhappy claiming the surgery made his life a . misery because it left him with a one-inch penis. He said he would . never be able to have a relationship with a woman. But finally, Warren is feeling optimistic about the future ahead of more surgery later this month and has now revealed how he would one day like to host his own talk show. He told the Huffington Post: 'Talk radio is a longtime love,"" he says. ""And the past few years has given me an awful lot of practice. 'If my life is proof of one thing, it's that anything's possible.' 'It was the worst pain I ever felt in my life,' he told the New York Post. 'It got so bad one day that I stood in . my living room and cried. There was a fresh breakage of skin...and it stung to no end. 'I was expecting to be stared at — if you look like a freak you expect people to look at you like you’re a freak,' he said. Before: Wesley Warren spent the past five years of his life with a freakishly huge scrotum - the result of a rare medical condition called scrotal lymphedema . Home help: His ordeal began when he woke up one morning five years ago with a shooting pain in his groin, which grew steadily worse and his scrotum steadily bigger over the next nine months . 'I would only get upset when, every . once-in-a-while, some person with no manners would stare at me and start . laughing and give me that ""freak passing by"" look. 'That caused me . in the past to say a ""word"" or two with regards to rudeness. 'Besides, I was OK with the stares. That’s what I was . expecting.' Though he initially complained that he was 'still disfigured', he has since become more optimistic about his future. 'I can see a light at the end of the . tunnel, but I’m still in the tunnel.' The . extremely rare condition is much more common in Africa and Southeast . Asia, where it is caused by parasites, than it is in the western world. Unhappy: Wesley Warren expected his life to be transformed after he had his 132 lbs scrotum removed, but the surgery has left him 'disfigured' Surgery: Wesley Warren Jr., pictured before surgery, is recovering after his giant scrotum was removed . Discomfort: Warren could not urinate like a normal man and wore a hoodie for pants to conceal his enormous genitals . Talking about his life before the . operation he describes himself as a prisoner to his testicles and that . the growth ruled his life. 'I could only walk in baby steps – I had to stop every 30 seconds,' he said. 'It . was just horrible. I couldn’t get in and out of a vehicle and even then . I fell down on to the pavement and it took four grown men to try and . lift me up. For sale: Mr Warren initially considered selling his scrotum on eBay in order to pay for surgery . Fear: Warren was also afraid of dying on the operating table or losing his penis and his testicles if the complex procedure went wrong .","Wesley Warren Jr. suffered from rare medical condition scrotal lymphedema .

"Police in Swaziland will enforce a colonial law to stop women wearing miniskirts and other 'sexual' clothing. Officers say the clothes 'encourage rape' (file picture) Women in Swaziland have been banned from wearing miniskirts and crop tops because they 'encourage rape' - and offenders face a six-month spell in jail. Police in Swaziland, the last absolute monarchy in Africa and an incredibly conservative nation, have resurrected an archaic colonial criminal act from 1889 to stop women wearing clothes that expose their body. Swazi police were responding to a march in the second city of Manzini last month by young women, some wearing miniskirts, who were seeking equal rights and safety. In Swaziland women are legal minors and two-thirds of teenage girls have been victims of sexual assault, according to the South African Independent Online. Police spokesperson Wendy Hleta warned: 'They will be arrested. 'The act of the rapist is made easy, because it would be easy to remove the half-cloth worn by the women. 'We do not encourage that women should be harmed, but at the same time people should note acceptable conduct of behaviour,' she said. The ban also applies to low-slung jeans and tank tops. However, the 'indlamu' costume, a tiny beaded belt worn when young women dance for King Mswati topless and with their buttocks fully exposed, is permissible, authorities declared. Hleta said this apparel is permissible because police have no records of any maiden being raped while wearing the costume. Ceremony: The tiny beaded dress worn when maidens dance semi-naked for the autocratic King Mswati III does not fall foul of the new law (file picture) The king, who has been criticised for his lavish lifestyle in an impoverished country, already has 13 wives. Women have also been advised on a way to retrieve dropped objects that will not make them 'culpable' in their own assaults by 'exciting males'. Hleta said: 'For females it is polite that when you have dropped something, squat with your upper body still upright and pick up the item rather than bending half your body head first to pick up the item.' The Swazi police spokeswoman did not say whether a woman not following the guidelines for picking up a dropped object would be arrested or issued with a warning.

"When it comes to finding the right bra, even the most proficient shoppers often despair. And, according to a survey, it’s hardly surprising – because there are seven different ways in which they can go wrong. Four in five women admitted  to suffering from one of the problems, nicknamed ‘booby traps’, every day. Scroll down for video . The most common, experienced by 41 per cent of the 1,000 women surveyed, is the ‘side boob’, in which the cup underwiring sits on the breast rather than on the ribcage, causing overspill at the side. And more than a third admitted to experiencing the ‘quadraboob’, in which breasts spill over the top of a too-small cup, creating the impression of four breasts. What a boob! Britney Spears often suffers the dreaded Quadraboob . The survey, carried out by lingerie firm Bravissimo to mark the 100th anniversary of the creation of the bra, found many women hadn’t had a proper fitting in two years. Many wear bras that are too small because they cannot find attractive ones in larger sizes, or are unwilling to admit that their breasts are larger than DD – the biggest size in many ranges. Bravissimo is now launching an online ‘boob school’ to teach women how to choose a well-fitting bra. A spokesman said: ‘We’d noticed that there were a number of booby traps women were falling into, normally because they’ve never experienced a proper fitting and they simply don’t know how to spot the signs that their bra is no longer giving them the support they need. ‘By identifying the seven classic bra . faux pas and launching Boob School, we’re hoping that women everywhere . can become more knowledgeable about what makes a really good fitting . bra.’ Ladies with larger . assets experiencing more problems finding a properly fitted bra and . dealing with the challenges of having more to handle in the first place. The Quadraboob was the biggest pitfall . for ladies with a larger bust, with 53 per cent of women who were above a . GG cup size falling prey. Falling into that old booby trap: Christina Hendricks suffers a multitude of sins like the Ledge and Side Boob . The survey found 41 per cent of us suffer from the Side Boob, where wires in the cup sitting on your boob rather than your ribcage. The High Rider, where the back of the bra rides up, affects 39 per cent, while a third (36 per cent) get the dreaded Quadraboob, where the bust spills over the top of the cup, giving the impression of four boobs. The Big Stand Off, where the front of the bra doesn't sit flat on the sternum between the boobs affects almost a third (28 per cent) while the Super Drooper affects a quarter (26 per cent) who aren't getting enough support, creating the illusion of saggy boobs. Another quarter who buy bras that are too big, 24 pr cent, suffer from the appearance of Saggy Cups where there's too much fabric. Not their breast effort: Denise Welch's cups are a tad small as she's getting some Side Boob, and Super Drooper Lyndsay Lohan isn't supported . The Ledge is created with over uplift, transforming your boobs into something that resembles a ledge, and it affects 12 per cent (including voluptuous Christina Hendricks). Although all the faux pas identified . could be avoided by wearing a good fitting bra, only one in five women . said that they were extremely confident that they were wearing the . correct bra size. This . is unsurprising, as the study also identified several reasons why women . continually experience such uncertainty about their bra size. Over . a two year period, three quarters (77 per cent) have lost or gained . weight, 62 per cent have changed their clothes size, 17 per cent have . gone through the menopause and 10 per cent have had a baby, all . potentially impacting upon their bra size. 1. The strap around your body should be firm but comfortable. When you stand side-on at a mirror, the strap that runs around your body should be horizontal and should not ride up at the back at all. 2. The wires at the front should lie flat against your rib cage and should not dig in, rub or poke out at the front. 3. Your breasts should be enclosed in the cups and you should have a smooth line where the fabric at the top of the cup ends and meets your bust. 4. You shouldn't have any ridge or bulging over the top or sides of the cups, even if you are wearing a balconette style or lower cut shape. Perfect fit? You should have a smooth line where the fabric at the top of the cup ends and meets your bust . However, . despite the shifts in boob size that women are experiencing, 24 per . cent of UK women admitted to having never had a bra fitting and 21 per cent . haven't been for a fitting for at least four years. The Bravissimo research was conducted by Curiosity Research and 1,155 women of all ages from across the UK completed the survey. They found that around two fifths of women feel comfortable telling a friend that they've made a bra faux pas - with a woman . from the North West most likely to be up front (50 per cent saying they'd tell a friend). Women from the South West and those aged 51 and over are the least likely to make a bra faux pas. A third of women have had a fitting . in the last year. Half of those who are GG+ Cup size have had a fitting . in the last year, the same applies to those aged 30 or under, but a quarter of women who hadn't had a . fitting in more than two years feel they simply don't need a fitting, . whilst a fifth are too embarrassed. After this lady got fitted by a professional she discovered her true, completely different, correctly fitting size . Four fifths own more than five bras, but less than half wear more than five bras regularly. Jo . Lee, Buying and Marketing Director at Bravissimo, comments: 'We'd . noticed for some time that there were a number of booby traps women were . falling into, normally because they've never experienced a proper . fitting and they simply don't know how to spot the signs that their bra . is no longer giving them the support they need. 'By . identifying the seven classic bra faux pas and launching Boob School, . we're hoping that women everywhere can become more knowledgeable about . what makes a really good fitting bra, so they feel more confident about . their bra size now and into the future and our brilliant British boobs . can finally get the treatment they deserve!' In response to the findings, Bravissimo . is now launching the world's first Boob School to help other women avoid . falling into these booby traps, in a bid to help women feel brilliant about their boobs. Boob . School will talk to women about their boobs, give advice on what they . should be looking for in a perfectly fitting bra by following their . simple lessons online, via a Facebook app or in store.

"The son of boxing champion Muhammad Ali has accused the millionaire's wife of refusing to let him see his ailing father. Muhammad Ali Junior, 41, who says he is forced to survive on food stamps in a rough Chicago neighbourhood, last saw his father on his 71st birthday a year ago. But as the legendary boxer turned 72 on January 17, Muhammad Ali Junior claims he couldn't even get through on the phone to wish him a happy birthday. He alleges his father's fourth wife of 27 years, Lonnie, has made it increasingly difficult for him to see or even speak to the retired sportsman who is in the advanced stages of Parkinson's disease. Ongoing family feud: Muhammad Ali Junior, 41, pictured left, claims he has been stopped from seeing his boxing champion father, pictured right in 2009, by his fourth wife Lonnie . 'Controlling': Lonnie, pictured with husband Muhammad Ali in 2012, has been accused of preventing members of the the boxer's family from seeing or even speaking to him . He says more than anything he wants to see his father before he dies. The boxer had nine children in total - seven daughter, Muhammad Ali Junior and Asaad, 22, who he adopted with Lonnie. Muhammad Ali Junior, who lives in a tiny two bedroom flat with his wife Shaakira and two daughters Ameera, six, and Shakera, five, says he has repeatedly tried to contact his father on the phone but doesn't have the money to make the trip to his Kentucky mansion. He told The Sun On Sunday: 'As soon as he married Lonnie, that's when the problems started. We can't see him any more. He can't see his own brother because of Lonnie. 'I tried calling him on his birthday but go no answer. When I call, they usually say he's in the shower, sleeping or in therapy, and to call back. Muhammad Ali Jnr claims he tried to contact his father, pictured in 2010, on his birthday earlier this month but he couldn't get through. He alleges that the boxer's fourth wife Lonnie never allows him to speak to his father . Act of kindness: Lonnie Ali's supporters insist she is merely defending her husband from family members who wish to leech off his fame . 'When I do they don't answer. I shouldn't need an appointment to to see my father.' Muhammad Ali Junior, who was born in 1972 to the boxer's second wife 17-year-old Belinda Boyd, believes Lonnie may have cut him out because he is unemployed and doesn't own a house or a car. The father-of-two says he has been trying to find a job but few people are hiring so he now shovels snow off his neighbours driveway just to make a few dollars to feed his family. He believes his father would help him with his current financial situation if he were still coherent, but says that is no longer the case. But he insists he doesn't care about his father's money, he just wants to be allowed back into his life and to spend as much time together as possible in the time he has left. Those who have defended Lonnie claim she is protecting Muhammad Ali from family members who want to sponge off his fame.

"Disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner bowed out of the New York City mayoral contest with his middle finger raised to the reporters who covered his scandal-ridden campaign. His wife Huma Abedin was not looking on as he gave his concession, and he didn't even thank his long-plagued wife in his remarks. Abedin was said to be hundreds of miles away in the Hamptons on Tuesday night but spotted coming out of the couple's Manhattan apartment Wednesday morning. Rather than bowing out gracefully, Weiner decided to throw one final insult at the voters by flipping his middle finger at the crowd as he drove off as captured by NY1 photographers. Instead of having his wife at the midtown bar where he and his supporters gathered Tuesday night, a different woman was attracting attention: Sydney Leathers, the woman with whom he had a sexting relationship, crashed his party. The mood was notably happier in Brooklyn where former public advocate Bill de Blasio celebrated his victory alongside his family, with the whole crew dancing next to one another in front of a cheering crowd. Scroll down for video . Send off: Anthony Weiner bird-flipping parting shot to reporters after his humiliating defeat made a bad situation even worse with the Clintons . Democratic mayoral hopeful Anthony Weiner leaves after making his concession speech at Connolly's Pub in Midtown Tuesday, September 10 . Sydney Leathers, who engaged in online sex chats with Democratic mayoral hopeful Anthony Weiner last summer, tries to enter his election gathering place at Connolly's Pub in New York Tuesday . 'Sadly we did not win this time, but I . could not be more proud of the campaign that we ran,' Weiner said to . the crowd inside Connolly's Irish Pub just before 11 p.m., accepting his . defeat with just 5 percent of the vote. 'I . could not be more proud of you.' He went on: 'We had the best ideas. Sadly, I was an imperfect messenger.' Leathers was seen wandering around the pub- clearly as an uninvited  guest- giving statements to reporters . and showing off her widely publicized plastic surgeries including a breast augmentation and a nose job. Her presence delayed the evening's festivities as it took Weiner half an hour to avoid a confrontation and run through a nearby fast food restaurant. After stepping down from Congress in 2011 following his first sexting scandal, Weiner was . hoping that his campaign for mayor would be his chance to reenter public . office and clear his name. The July revelations that he continued having inappropriate online relationships with women, including Leathers. Missing person: Weiner made his concession speech alone (left), without his wife Huma Abedin at his side as she had been in the beginning of the campaign (right) Weiner makes his concession speech, saying  'We had the best ideas. Sadly, I was an imperfect messenger' Democratic mayoral hopeful Anthony Weiner greets voters after making his concession speech . Different kind of support: Sydney Leathers was using the primary attention to promote her new song . It wasn't work: Longtime Clinton aide Huma Abedin was in the Hamptons but not with her boss, as former Secretary of State and likely presidential hopeful Hillary was at an event in Philadelphia on Tuesday . New Yorkers also voted against . another scandal-plagued politician on Tuesday as former New York . Governor Eliot Spitzer lost his race for city comptroller. Even . though he and Weiner were dealt the similar losses, Spitzer had a much . more successful campaign as he came within 4 points of Scott Stringer, . the former Manhattan Borough President who has worked in state politics . for the past two decades. Stringer had a . 52-percent-to-48-per cent lead over Spitzer in unofficial . returns, with 92 percent of precincts reporting. 'I am proud to have run a campaign . over the past nine weeks that many thought was incapable to mount,' Spitzer said in his concession speech. 'We did it in a way that made me . proud to revisit the issues we fought for when I was attorney general . and governor, to lay out an agenda of what we believed was right for . this great city.' Former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer delivers his concession speech at his election night party . Spitzer - who like Weiner, is married - was forced to resign five years ago after he admitted to hiring prostitutes . 'I say to the public, I am proud to have served,' he added. Spitzer - who like Weiner, is married - was forced to resign five years ago after he admitted to hiring prostitutes. His wife Silda Spitzer was not at the Tuesday night event and never made any campaign appearances during his nine-week bid for comptroller. 'All along we knew it was going to be a close race,' Spitzer campaign spokeswoman Lis Smith told MailOnline at his party Tuesday night. 'Yes people know Eliot and he has name recognition but Scott Stringer has the entire political establishment behind him- every union, every business.' Striking a clear contrast to his failed colleagues, Bill de Blasio danced and blew simultaneous kisses to the crowd with his wife and two children at their victory party in Gowanus, Brooklyn. De Blasio won 40.2 per cent of the Democratic vote, and while there is a chance of a run off between him and the second place candidate, Bill Thompson, that seems unlikely. 'You made this campaign a cause, and I say thank you for elevating it to that level,' the former public advocate said to his supporters. Victory: Even though second-place candidate Bill Thompson refused to concede saying that there will be a run off, Bill de Blasio (pictured) celebrated his 40.2 per cent victory . Coordinated: Bill and his wife Chirlane McCray blew simultaneous kisses at the crowd . Happy: De Blasio's family was a much of his campaign as he was, with son Dante and daughter Chiara joining him on stage Tuesday night at their victory party . De Blasio's interracial family was displayed prominently throughout the campaign as he featured his son Dante and his large afro in a number of television ads while his daughter Chiara frequently spoke on her father's behalf at events, including the victory party last night. 'Some of you may already be familiar with my brother Dante. My brother, my little brother, may look good on TV – but there's only one de Blasio who got to vote for her dad today,' she said, referring to a clip of her condemning current mayor Michael Bloomberg's comments about de Blasio using his family as a part of the campaign. While many have pegged De Blasio as the 'populist' candidate who will be facing Republican Joe Lhota in November, Dante is undoubtedly the fan-favorite as he had a round of cheers all his own at the Brooklyn party. 'In her enthusiasm Chiara just attempted to touch the hair. Security was ready to intervene,' Mr De Blasio joked.","Anthony Weiner lost the mayor's race and didn't thank his wife Huma in his concession speech Tuesday night .

"The New York hospital where the city's first Ebola patient is being treated has denied claims that hoards of health workers have called in sick out of fear of contracting the deadly virus. Bellevue Hospital Center, to which Dr Craig Spencer was admitted  on Thursday, was said to have suffered a staff shortage on Friday after a high number of medics failed to turn up for work. According to The New York Post, the employees feared they might become infected with Ebola like the two Dallas nurses who treated victim Thomas Eric Duncan, who died on October 8. However, hospital spokesman Ana Marengo has now denied there was any sickout, saying that nurses are willing treating Dr Spencer in pairs, 'with one serving as a buddy watching the other'. Scroll down for videos . Denial: Bellevue Hospital Center (pictured), where Ebola victim Dr Craig Spencer is being treated, has denied claims that hoards of health workers have called in sick out of fear of contracting the deadly disease . Quarantined: Dr Spencer (left), who has tested positive for Ebola, and his fiancee Morgan Dixon (right), who is under observation for the virus, have both been contained at the hospital in Manhattan, New York . Victim: Dr Spencer (pictured, left, in a hazmat suit, and, right, in his LinkedIn profile picture), is a Doctors Without Borders volunteer who has recently returning from aid work in Ebola-stricken Guinea, West Africa . Dr Spencer,  a Doctors Without Borders volunteer, was admitted to Bellevue after recently returning from aid work in Guinea, West Africa, which is Ground Zero for Ebola. He was found to have a 100.3-degree fever, one of the primary symptoms of infection, and later tested positive for the virus. He is currently undergoing treatment and is in a 'stable' condition. Earlier today, a source told the newspaper that nurses are 'terrified' to enter the 'isolation chamber' where Dr Spencer is being treated for Ebola. 'The nurses on the floor are miserable with a ''why me?'' attitude, scared to death and overworked because all their co-workers called out sick,' said the source. 'One nurse even went as far as to pretend she was having a stroke to get out of working there, but once they cleared her in the ER they sent her back up.' Dr Spencer, who remains in a stable condition, has reportedly been putting his medical skills to use by lecturing the staff about his treatment. In treatment: After being admitted to Bellevue, Dr. Spencer (pictured) was found to have a 100.3-degree fever, one of the primary symptoms of Ebola. He is currently undergoing treatment and is in a 'stable' condition . 'As a doctor, he knows a lot about medicine, so he would call the nurse's station all day and going back and forth to the doctors on what to do,' the source said. Visits are forbidden and the victim's fiancée and two friends - who had been in close contact with him in the days leading up to his diagnosis - have been quarantined as a precaution. His fiancée Morgan Dixon, 30, who lived with Dr Spencer, is also under isolation at the hospital. Although the victim's doctors would not go into detail about his condition, New York City Mayor Bill di Blasio said on Thursday night that the patient was 'in good shape.'.

Dr Spencer arrived in New York on October 17 - six days before he was admitted to hospital. During that time he went bowling in Brooklyn, rode the subway and took a taxi, walked Manhattan's High Line and went to restaurants. He reportedly started feeling ill on Tuesday, but the fever did not develop until Thursday. He promptly called officials at Doctors Without Borders, who then called New York's health department. Emergency health workers rushed to Spencer's apartment on West 147th Street, Manhattan's Harlem neighborhood, in full protective gear.

He was taken to Bellevue about 1pm and his apartment was sealed off, with biohazard cleaners brought in. Earlier this month, nurses Nina Pham, 26, and Amber Vinson, 29, were diagnosed with Ebola after caring for victim Mr Ducan, a 42-year-old Liberian, at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. They have both since been declared 'Ebola-free': Miss Pham has been released, while Ms Vinson is still receiving supportive care at Atlanta's Emory University Hospital in Georgia.

Symptoms of Ebola include a fever, a headache, diarrhea, vomiting, muscle and joint aches and in some cases bleeding. These appear two to 21 days after exposure to the disease, the CDC said.

"A knifeman has been sectioned after he allegedly plunged a knife into the chest of a teenager, killing her as she sat on a bus on her way to school. Christina Edkins, 16, died from a single stab wound to the chest when she was stabbed on the top deck of a Birmingham bus. CCTV footage shows the suspect standing with his back to the driver and his hands on the door handles,  calmly waiting to make his escape just seconds after killing Christina.

She walked upstairs, taking her seat . in front of the man who would kill her minutes later as she made her way . to Leasowes Community College in Halesowen, about five miles away. ‘The bus was in the process of . stopping when the attack took place,’ said Detective Superintendent . Richard Baker from West Midlands Police. ‘There was no conversation between . him and Christina at all. The suspect calmly walked up behind Christina . and stabbed her. It happened really, really quickly. 'This was not a frenzied attack. He’s . walked downstairs, waited for the bus to stop and walked off. It was . [over] in one or two seconds.’ The attack has been captured on CCTV. The officer said he believed Christina did not initially realise what . had happened to her, before suddenly screaming out. A teenage boy, aged about 16 and from . a different school, was sitting at the back of the bus and ran . downstairs to tell the driver to call 999. ‘He was sitting behind the attacker, . on the back seat. He was in his own world. She has clearly called for . help,’ Mr Baker added. A mother of two came face to face with the killer as he waited to get off.

Stephanie Bent would later rush . upstairs and try desperately to revive Christina with two other women . but had to wait for a few awful moments, fearing for her own life, as . the killer stood beside her by the bus doors before escaping. ‘I knew what he had done and he was . stood next to me when he was getting off,’ she wrote on Facebook. ‘All I . could think of was, I hope he gets off this stop so I can go upstairs . and help the girl.’ Yesterday, schoolfriends left floral . tributes to Christina near the scene of her death.

"A Florida woman has been found guilty of locking her boyfriend's son in a cupboard and starving him and could now face up to 120 years behind bars. Sharon Glass, 49, from Brevard, was found guilty on eight counts of aggravated child abuse on Friday after four days on trial. She and her boyfriend Michael Marshall, 40, were arrested in 2012 after police found Marshall's 12-year-old son lying on the bathroom floor weighing just 40 pounds. Brutal: Sharon Glass (left) has been found guilty of eight counts of aggravated child abuse and now faces up to 120 years behind bars while her boyfriend Michael Marshall (right) is awaiting trial on similar charges . On Friday Glass told the court that she hadn't noticed the boy was emaciated because he was always wearing baggy jumpers. She also claimed she had nothing to do with disciplining the boy, who was regularly locked in a cupboard and tied to a bed post. She said she wanted to leave the relationship with Marshall, but that during the four years she dated him he threatened to kill her several times. Marshall is currently in jail awaiting trial on similar charges. During the trial the boy, now 14, described being starved nearly to death and locked in both a closet and a bathroom for days on end by his father and his father's girlfriend. Looking far healthier than he did when he was rescued two years ago weighing just 40 pounds, the boy testified at Sharon Glass' child abuse trial Wednesday, softly recounting his time with the woman, who he first met in 2009 when he was in the third grade and she was dating his dad, Michael Marshall. Giving short answers to the prosecutor's questions, he said Glass quickly moved into their home in Titusville, Florida and he began to call her 'mom.' But he soon started getting in trouble, beginning with the time Glass accused him of stealing an iPod, he told the court. Scroll down for video .

According to clickorlando.com, he testified . he didn't take the gadget, but was later accused of stealing other . things, and was severely punished for taking fruit off a tree and hiding . food. 'I was constantly locked up,' the boy, who hasn't been identified, said. He said he would escape when he was put in his room, leading Glass to threaten to leave Marshall if he didn't lock the boy up. So . the father did. The boy, without shedding a tear or changing his tone . of voice, told the court they put him in a closet and secured the door . with a bungee cord and a desk. He even bravely illustrated with a laser pointer how they wrapped a cord around the knobs of the sliding closet doors to keep him inside. When asked if Glass and Marshall would talk to him, he replied: 'Not unless they were telling me to be quiet, basically.' They gave him diapers so they wouldn't have to let him out to use the bathroom and he was fed macaroni noodles, ramen noodles and sometimes canned vegetables. When he was out of the closet he would take any food he could find and hide it, he said. Evidence: The court was shown pictures of the closet the boy was locked in, pictured . Bathroom: He was also locked in this bathroom . Numerous holidays passed when he was locked away, including Valentines Day, St. Patrick's Day and Easter. Later, he was locked in a bathroom after his father zip-tied him to the post of a bunk bed for three days and he chewed through the ropes to escape. But he said on Christmas day in 2011 he was let out of the bathroom to watch other children who lived in the house open gifts. He was then put back inside with a stocking full of coal. 'I just cried,' he recounted. He noticed himself getting smaller he said, and his clothes getting baggier. The court was shown a tiny pair of Spiderman pajamas, boys size 8, that he was found in and pictures showing a malnourished child with gaunt cheeks and skeletal ribs. It wasn't until March 2012 that he was rescued from his hell, when a family friend raised the alarm. At the time, investigators said another month of the alleged horrific abuse would have killed him. Thankfully, there were no obvious signs of the trauma he endured when he appeared in court, now a teen, not yet 5-feet tall. He smiled at times and even laughed. Arrest: The couple were finally arrested in March 2012 when the boy was freed . Rescued: The boy, with his face obscured, is seen in March 2012 when police rescued him from the home . Making the case all the more horrific is the fact that teachers at the child's school first reported his injuries to authorities some 17 months before he was eventually rescued. Distraught teachers at South Lake Elementary School said they repeatedly called the Department for Children and Families to try to get help for the boy, then aged 12. The abuse started while he was a pupil at the school. The boy moved to Apollo Elementary School where he spent just 10 days in class before being withdrawn to be home-schooled. Marshall and Glass were angered because he was getting extra food at school, police said. About . two months after taking him out, they told the district he would attend . a private school - essentially stopping the district's efforts to keep . track of him and his education. Home: Distraught teachers at South Lake Elementary School said they repeatedly called the Department for Children and Families to try to get help for the boy, then aged 12, but were ignored . 'We tried, and we tried, and we begged,' said Ronda Rochon, the boy's teacher at the school he attended for third, fourth and fifth grade. 'I honestly thought the next call that I got about him was that he would be dead.' Glass's ex-husband, Tony Glass, said he called DCF 12 times, concerned that his three children who lived with their mother were often dirty and had head lice. 'I called them so many times because of my concerns with the kids, they told me to stop calling,' he said. 'If you’re told by DCF to stop calling, what else can you do? Who else can you call?' The last time the department looked into the complaints was 2010 when they decided there was not enough evidence to justify removing the boy from his father. 'There is a difference between reporting child abuse and reporting concern and being able to remove a child from their home,' DCF spokeswoman Carrie Hoeppner told MailOnline. Speaking to Florida Today at the time she added: 'You can't remove a child on a hunch. Of all the resources we have, the one tool we don't have is a crystal ball.' Begging for help: 'We tried, and we tried, and we begged,' said Ronda Rochon, the boy's teacher at the school he attended for third, fourth and fifth grade, of DCF . Action was eventually taken on March 15 when a woman walked into Titusville Police Department told officers her boyfriend had gone to a friend's home and had seen an emaciated boy locked in the bathroom. Detectives went to the house and found the boy curled up on the floor. Police said the boy would be zip-tied to a bed in a standing position and forced to sleep that way. To stop him from crying, a dirty sock was duct-taped in his mouth. The couple arrived home while police were still at the property and reportedly confessed to caging and punishing the boy, including denying him food, according to Local 6 News. They said they punished the boy because he began stealing food after it was being withheld from him, Titusville police said in the report. Hospital staff said the condition of the child when he was found resembled images of  'concentration camp survivors.' He was severely malnourished and treated for dehydration. The boy and two of his siblings have been in DCF custody since the ordeal.","Sharon Glass, 49, found guilty on eight counts of aggravated child abuse .

"The National Park Service has acquired a rare Civil War-era photograph of an enslaved woman who helped save Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee's home in Arlington, Virginia. The previously unknown photograph depicts Selina Gray, the head housekeeper to Lee and his family, along with two girls. The photograph was unveiled Thursday at the Arlington House plantation overlooking the nation's capital that was home to Lee and dozens of slaves before the Civil War. The National Park Service has acquired a rare Civil War-era photograph of an enslaved woman who helped save Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee's home in Arlington, Virginia . The photograph was unveiled Thursday at the Arlington House plantation overlooking the nation's capital that was home to Lee and dozens of slaves before the Civil War . An inscription on the back of the image reads 'Gen Lees Slaves Arlington Va.' Park officials said this is only the second known photograph taken of slaves at Arlington. 'It's extremely rare to have an identified photo of an enslaved person,' said National Park Service spokeswoman Jenny Anzelmo-Sarles. 'Since slaves were considered property, it's very rare to have a photo where you can identify the people in the photo.' Gray is noted in history books for helping to save Arlington House after Lee's family left and the plantation was captured by Union troops during the Civil War. An inscription on the back of the image reads 'Gen Lees Slaves Arlington Va' The photograph was purchased on eBay in September for $700 after a volunteer found it online . The previously unknown photograph depicts Selina Gray, the head housekeeper to Lee and his family, along with two girls . As Lee was off leading the Confederate army, Gray supposedly told Union soldiers raiding the home to keep their hands off 'Mrs. Lee's things,' KSDK reports. Among the heirlooms she saved at the Arlington House were several items that once belonged to George Washington. Wife Mary Lee was related he the Washington's and inherited various heirlooms. Arlington House was originally built as a monument to George Washington. Lee's wife, Mary Custis Lee, entrusted the home to Gray, and she later confronted a Union general about soldiers pilfering Washington family heirlooms from the house. She was able to have the items safeguarded. Gray was finally granted freedom in 1862. Her family then settled on land near Arlington. The photograph was purchased on eBay in September for $700 after a volunteer found it online. The seller was based in England and found the photo in a box of unwanted images. The photograph will be unveiled to the public Saturday, and it will be used in future exhibits after Arlington House and its slave quarters are restored over the next two years . The nonprofit Save Arlington House Inc. donated funds to acquire the image. The photograph will be unveiled to the public Saturday, and it will be used in future exhibits after Arlington House and its slave quarters are restored over the next two years. Historians will study the image and hope to learn more about it.","The photograph was purchased on in September for $700 and given to Arlington House plantation for display .

"A schoolboy has been excluded from lessons after he organised a mass protest over a lack of homework. Aaron Parfitt, 14, led 100 of his fellow pupils on a walkout at Bispham High School in Blackpool last Wednesday over concerns about teaching standards. Despite his eagerness to learn, Aaron was told he was banned from lessons for the next two days, and now claims to have been excluded again ahead of a meeting between teachers and his mother. Excluded: Aaron Parfitt led 100 pupils on a mass walkout at Bispham High School in Blackpool last Wednesday. Aaron claims the pupils' concerns over teaching standards at the school were not being addressed . Banned: After the protest, Aaron was told he was not allowed to attend lessons for the next two days. He now claims to have been excluded again ahead of a meeting between teachers and his mother later this afternoon . Aaron originally contacted Blackpool Council and . Ofsted to raise concerns over the quality of teaching before losing . patience and organising the 100-strong walkout last Wednesday. Teachers took a dim view of his actions and excluded him for two days on Thursday and Friday last week - much to the anger of his mother Janet, 52. Now Aaron - who returned to the school today - claims he has been told he has been excluded again ahead of a meeting with teachers and Mrs Parfitt later this afternoon. 'I'm absolutely fuming they've excluded him because he's doing the best he can to get a good education,' she said. 'He was only trying to stick up for himself and his mates and then he gets told to stay away from the school for two days,' she added. Mrs Parfitt says her son emailed Blackpool Council and Ofsted to say he was worried about teaching standards, but claims they kept passing him on to other numbers. Protest: Aaron originally contacted Blackpool Council and Ofsted to raise concerns over the quality of teaching before losing patience and organising the mass walkout last Wednesday . She says Aaron eventually got so 'fed up' that he started to organise the protest. 'I got a voicemail from the school telling me that Aaron had been excluded for two days and that they were going to call me back to chat to me about what he'd done,' Mrs Parfitt said. 'They asked me to go in with Aaron today to discuss it but they didn't phone me back to talk properly so it's wrong that I'm being asked to take time off work to go in,' she added. Walkout: Aaron says that on returning to school today, he was told he had been excluded again . Aaron said he felt forced into staging the mass walkout after raising his concerns to the school's acting head teacher, his head of year, and the head of the maths department. He said: 'I failed my maths exam in school and I was really worried because I just wanted to make sure I was able to do the work properly.' 'We've had loads of different teachers and we weren't getting enough homework so I decided to call the council and Ofsted to see if they would help me but they couldn't,' he added. Aaron said that after his complaints got nowhere, he and a group of friends decided to walk out of their lessons. He said that by the time the group got to the school's playing field, they noticed a large number of pupils had followed. 'There must have been around 100 people with me in the end and everyone sent me messages afterwards saying well done for sticking up for my friends,' Aaron said. In May last year Bispham High School was placed under special measures by Ofsted inspectors who said standards were low and that there was too much 'mediocre teaching'. A more recent report, conducted in September, said the school was making 'reasonable progress' - although acting head teacher Deborah Hanlon-Catlow said it was still a 'challenging' period. 'This is undoubtedly a challenging time for the school. However, with support from Blackpool Council, we will continue to work to try to improve teaching standards, attendance, behaviour and punctuality,' she told the Blackpool Gazette at the time,' she said. 'This will not happen overnight but we will continue to work with Ofsted, parents, staff and pupils towards gradual improvement,' Mrs Hanlon-Catlow was quoted as saying. 'The school has a proactive policy in dealing with complaints from both parents and pupils... We are also passionate about ensuring that pupils and parents have a voice and are listened to,' she added. Councillor Ivan Taylor, Blackpool Council's cabinet member for children's services, said: 'The school is going through a transitional period...However, this is not an excuse for poor standards and we have given additional support to the school to try to help it to improve.' 'The welfare and education of the pupils is our number one priority and we always make sure that complaints are thoroughly investigated.'","Aaron Parfitt organised protest over concerns about standards of teaching .

"It was a more muted affair for President Obama in Berlin today as he spoke at Berlin's iconic Brandenburg Gate before an invite-only crowd of 4,500 guests - a remarkable difference from the rock-star welcome he received five years ago in front of 195,500 cheering supporters. Then, Obama had it all to play for - the glowing presidential candidate symbolizing America's revived hope for the future. This time, he arrived back in Berlin under the cloud of NSA surveillance programs which have outraged many Europeans and the ever-growing crisis in Syria. The President removed his jacket and rolled up his sleeves as he battled the 86F temperature on Wednesday, quipping: 'People of Berlin, your welcome is so warm I'm going to take off my jacket.' Scroll down for video . Warm reception: President Obama battled the blistering heat as he delivered a rousing speech in Berlin on Wednesday .

Casually does it: Obama gestures next to German Chancellor Angela Merkel as he prepares to address the capital close to 50 years after JFK's address at the historic site . Sparse: Crowds gather ahead of Obama's speech at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin on Wednesday . What a difference five years makes: 200,000 people came out to see then presidential candidate Barack Obama speak in 2008 at the Victory Column, around a mile from his speech today . At times wiping away beads of sweat, the President read from paper because the teleprompter wasn't working. He used the bulk of his speech to call for a reduction in the . world's nuclear stockpiles - as he stood  behind high walls of bullet-proof . glass in the public square. The two-inch thick sheets are routinely used when the President appears before large crowds in public spaces. Appealing for a new citizen activism, Obama renewed his call for the world to confront climate change, a danger he called 'the global threat of our time'. In a wide-ranging speech that enumerated a litany of challenges facing the world, Obama said he wanted to reignite the spirit that Berlin displayed when it fought to reunite itself during the Cold War. 'Today's threats are not as stark as they were half a century ago, but the struggle for freedom and security and human dignity, that struggle goes on,' Obama said at the city's historic Brandenburg Gate under a bright, hot sun. '""And I come here to this city of hope because the test of our time demands the same fighting spirit that defined Berlin a half-century ago.' The German press had mixed reviews for Obama on Wednesday, a marked difference from five years ago when 'Obama-mania' greeted him in the streets. National newspaper Die Zeit published an article online on the Berlin speech, saying that Obama appeared to be the 'young, fresh, uninhibited' political force he was five years ago - but that the time between his speeches has been marked by 'bitter disappointment'. The article said Obama's battles over gun control and equality for same-sex marriage must be remembered, otherwise his speech in Berlin could be seen as just 'nice words' in light of his decisions on Guantanamo and the NSA surveillance. Reflective: The thick sheets of bullet-proof glass in front of and behind the President can been seen in this wide angle shot . Welcome back Mr President: Obama returned Berlin to make a speech following his rousing address in 2008 while he was still a presidential candidate . How did I do? Obama gestures to Berlin Mayor Klaus Wowereit at the Brandenburg Gate . Strong words: U.S. President Barack Obama gives a speech in front of Berlin's landmark the Brandenburg Gate  on June 19 . Rousing words: Obama addresses the crowd in Berlin from behind safety glass . The president called for a one-third . reduction of U.S. and Russian nuclear stockpiles in his speech, saying . it is possible to ensure American security and a strong deterrent while . also limiting nuclear weapons. Obama's address comes nearly 50 years after John F. Kennedy's famous Cold War speech in the once-divided city. Obama's comments today in Berlin about 'breaking down the walls' come tinged with irony as the President delivered his remarks behind thick walls of bullet-proof glass. The safety measure has been a constant presence throughout his presidency when he makes appearances in large public spaces. The last time that Obama spoke to 200,000 people in Berlin, there was no safety glass  - but then, he was not yet president. It was put up at his victory speech in November 2008, when Obama and family waved to supporters behind the two-inch thick walls. Since then, it has been in constant use. The reported $100million cost of Obama's trip to Africa this month includes three trucks with sheets of bullet­proof glass - some of which will be used to cover hotel windows. Obama . told Berlin that countries should not focus inwards and that . in order to be stronger we need to break down the walls in our hearts. He added: 'When Europe and America lead with our hopes instead of our fears we achieve things no other nations can do.' He challenged Americans and Europeans not to become complacent even though the Cold War is over. Obama says there's a temptation to . turn inward now that barbed wire and concrete walls no longer separate . East and West in Berlin. He said that he returned to Berlin because the tests of our time require the same fighting spirit. Obama added: 'Our work is not yet done.' Other . than his landmark speech, the President spent Wednesday in talks with . German chancellor Angela Merkel and other top politicians including . president Joachim Gauck. He touched down with his family in the German capital on Tuesday night, waving to the crowds gathered at Tegel Airport. His . wife Michelle and daughters Malia and Sasha visited the city's . Holocaust memorial on Wednesday, accompanied by the President's . half-sister Auma, who studied in Germany. Strong words: Obama spoke about reducing nuclear arms during his speech today . Echoes of history: Obama reference JFK's famous words at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin . Phew! Obama appeared to struggle in the heat today as the temperatures in Berlin soared to 86F . Political friends: U.S. Ambassador to Germany Philip Murphy and Auma Obama, half-sister of the President, wait for his speech in front of Brandenburg Gate. Five years ago, when he was still . seeking election as President, Obama received a rapturous reception on a . brief tour of Europe where he was greeted as a leader who could give . the world a fresh start after the controversial presidency of George W. Bush. Now he is a much more . divisive figure - although his re-election last year was welcomed by . most Europeans, recent revelations about his administration's spying on . internet communications have tarnished his record in the eyes of many. Mr Obama's speech tomorrow will . inevitably be compared with JFK's, which took place on June 26, 1963 at . the Rathaus Schöneberg, a few miles away from the Berlin Wall which had . been under construction over the previous two years. Kennedy's . speech, considered one of his best, held up West Germany as a symbol of . freedom on the front line of the battle against communism.

"A nasty showdown erupted on the set of The View last Thursday when the show's moderator Whoopi Goldberg and co-host Rosie O'Donnell got into a heated spat in front of the studio audience. Rosie was upset because Whoopi cut her off on a 'Hot Topic' subject that O'Donnell indicated she was passionate about backstage before the show. The segment ran out of time and Whoopi had to cut to a commercial, a show insider tells MailOnline exclusively. The 'Hot Topic' was on spanking and the segment was running long, so producers told Whoopi it was time to go to commercial break in her ear. Rosie refuses to wear an ISD monitor in her ear so the control room is unable to speak to her. Scroll down for video . Showdown: Rosie O'Donnell took it personally when The View's moderator Whoopi Goldberg cut her off from a 'Hot Topic"" on spanking being discussed on the show . Hug it out: Looks can be deceiving, especially between Rosie and Whoopi. Show sources say there's no love lost between the co-hosts . Whoopi told her that if she had an ear monitor, she would have known what was going on. When Whoopi did the abrupt cut to commercial, when Rosie let loose, the insider said. 'As soon as they went to commercial break, Rosie took the handheld microphone that they use to engage the audience,' explains the tipster. 'Instead of talking to the crowd, Rosie spoke directly to Whoopi in the mic that she ""hurt my feelings,"" and that she was ""very upset by it"" and ""didn't appreciate"" what Whoopi had done.' Standing to the side without a microphone, Whoopi responded by saying: 'This isn't the time for this, Rosie.' Instead of moving on, O'Donnell continued to gripe openly in front of the audience in the microphone about what she perceived as an on-air snub. 'Well I just don't appreciate you saying that you were going to do something and not doing it. It makes me upset and I just don't want to have to go through this,' O'Donnell continued. Goldberg, looking annoyed, shot back: 'I said this was not the time Rosie.' Not phased by the Oscar winner's petition to leave matters alone until after the show, the 52-year-old comedienne continued to vent about Whoopi's actions. The View moderator then fired back to Rosie: 'F*** it, I told you to leave it alone and you just don't want to listen. If you want to go there Rosie, I will dammit. I'm really sick of your s***!' A hush fell over the studio. Love you, mean it? Rosie O'Donnell and newbies Rosie Perez (left of Rosie) and Nicolle Wallace put their hands together for returning Whoopi in the season premier. But show insiders say Rosie wants to rule the roost as moderator . 'At this point, you could've heard a pin drop. It was like everything came to a standstill and Rosie finally backed down,' the source explained. New co-host Rosie Perez then jumped up and made light of the moment, ending the quiet that had fallen over the room. 'Oh s***, Twitter is going to be off the hook now,' Perez quipped, causing the crowd to laugh. 'They're about to get it,' she continued. Producers hurried over to the two ladies with notes and information regarding the next segment and when the show returned live, it was as though nothing had gone wrong. Relations between Rosie and Whoopi behind the scenes at The View have been tense since the beginning of the season, as sources believe that O'Donnell really wants to be in her old moderator role and is having a hard time playing second fiddle to Goldberg. Additionally, Goldberg has begged ABC to terminate her contract with the network and pay her the remaining $10 million on her deal to go home, as she hates working on the show now, particularly with all of the changes. Kiss and make up:  After Rosie and Whoopi's heated exchange, 'you could've heard a pin drop,' said a show insider. 'It was like everything came to a standstill and Rosie finally backed down,' the source explained . Sources at The View tell MailOnline that Rosie has been a terror from the get-go, only allowing the three new executive producers and co-hosts; Whoopi and newcomers Rosie Perez and Nicolle Wallace, to communicate with her and making it clear to everyone in earshot, she's literally running the show. 'She has a definitive view of how she would like the show to go and wants everyone else to fall in line,' said a show insider. When Rosie and new co-host Nicole Wallace did a test show with two fill-in hosts in an effort to build chemistry. Neither Rosie Perez or Whoopi were present. Despite the fact that Whoopi is the regular moderator for the show, leading the discussion, Rosie took charge of the test show with Nicole. 'It was almost as though she was rehearsing for when she eventually takes over as moderator. It's clear that she would have preferred being in that capacity as she was before,' offered the source. Keeping her dukes up: Perhaps Whoopi was explaining the confrontation as she left ABC's studio on Monday .

"A restaurant is going against the trend of stores banning customers from bringing in their guns - by offering a 10% discount to those who do. Bergeron's Boudin and Cajun Meats in Port Allen, Louisiana, is cutting the price for anyone who comes in with their firearm. Owner Kevin Cox said the initial idea was to entice police officers who were on duty to come in but he extended the policy when other customers asked for the deal. Scroll down for video . Bergeron's Boudin and Cajun Meats in Port Allen, Louisiana, is cutting the price for anyone who comes in and shows staff their firearm . Patrons who flock to the store, which specializes in cajun meats and fried catfish, now say they feel safer when sitting down to their favorite meal. Mr Cox told WAFB: 'If you have a gun on you, I'm going to give you a discount. He added: 'Everyone is banning guns. Target is banning guns. Everywhere is banning guns, and they need to realize this is where people with guns are going to go. 'I want to take the opposite approach. How can I make this place safer?' The local restaurant has 500 customers in daily and Mr Cox has said he hands out up to 15 discounts a day. Owner Kevin Cox said the initial idea was to entice police officers who were on duty to come in - but he extended the policy when other customers asked for the deal . 'My friends and relatives would come in with their guns on their holster. I felt good about that. It made me feel safer that they were there with their gun so why not include all good citizens with the officers too,' said Cox. Customer Steve Moore supports the policy and believes it protects his Second Amendment rights. He told the station: 'I think it protects the restaurant. It discourages people from breaking in. If they think someone may have a gun and it's concealed, you'll think twice about coming in and robbing somebody.' Olivia Carambat stopped by for lunch last Thursday with her Smith and Wesson 38. She said: 'There's so many people who are trying to take our guns away and the government makes stricter gun laws. They forget that we really do, we're given the right in the Constitution to keep and bear arms.' Louisiana has open gun laws which mean you are free to carry a firearm if you are over the age of 17 and  those around you can see it. No licence is required to purchase a rifle or shotgun.

"Dr Nancy Snyderman apologized for violating quarantine guidelines on Monday - but made sure her NBC team shared the blame . NBC chief medical correspondent Nancy Snyderman has dodged blame for violating a voluntary Ebola quarantine  agreement by visiting her favorite soup restaurant. The 62-year-old doctor made an apologetic statement to NBC News on Monday which nevertheless shifted responsibility for the breach on to the whole team. Dr Snyderman wrote: 'While under voluntary quarantine guidelines, which called for our team to avoid public contact for 21 days, members of our group violated those guidelines and understand that our quarantine is now mandatory until 21 days have passed. 'We remain healthy and our temperatures are normal. 'As a health professional I know that we have no symptoms and pose no risk to the public, but I am deeply sorry for the concerns this episode caused.' She added: 'We are thrilled that Ashoka (Mukpo) is getting better and our thoughts continue to be with the thousands affected by Ebola whose stories we all went to cover.' However her NBC colleague, Today anchor Matt Lauer, blasted the doctor today to TMZ, saying she was at fault for breaking the voluntary quarantine. Lauer said: 'She's already admitted it was wrong... she knows she made a mistake. 'It was extraordinary time, we have to take extraordinary measures. It was a mistake, it won't happen again.' Witnesses said that the physician and broadcaster wore sunglasses with her hair in a ponytail as she pulled up outside the Peasant Grill in Hopewell Boro, New Jersey, close to Princeton University, last Thursday.

Nancy Snyderman, pictured while covering the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, violated her voluntary isolation to visit her favorite soup kitchen in New Jersey last week, according to reports . Today anchor Matt Lauer, blasted Dr Snyderman on Tuesday, saying she was at fault for breaking the voluntary quaratine (the pair are pictured in an earlier broadcast about Ebola) Dr Snyderman was one of seven people ordered to cut off all human contact for 21 days on Friday as doctors treat the station's cameraman Ashoka Mukpo for the deadly disease. It emerged this weekend that the crew would have been allowed more freedom if it was not for Dr Snyderman's alleged trip to the Peasant Grill, where she is said to be a regular and love the soups. Shortly after the alleged trip to the dining spot, the New Jersey Department of Health forced the crew into mandatory quarantine. The NJ Health Department said: 'Unfortunately, the NBC crew violated this agreement and so the Department of Health Friday evening issued a mandatory quarantine order to ensure that the crew will remain confined until October 22. 'The NBC crew remains symptom-free, so there is no reason for concern of exposure to the community.' The team had initially been encouraged to isolate themselves following Mukpo's diagnosis. The group was reporting on the Ebola outbreak for NBC News in Liberia when Mukpo, their freelance cameraman, was diagnosed with the virus just a day after he was hired to work for the team. Mukpo's family said last week that he believed he had contracted Ebola when he was washing down a vehicle that had transported bodies that perished from the disease. Ebola is transmitted through contact with blood and body fluids. The cameraman was infected in West Africa but is being treated at the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha after being flown in on a specially-altered flight with an isolation chamber. The 33-year-old has received an experimental drug called brincidofovir, or CMX001, and a blood transfusion from Dr Kent Brantly, who beat Ebola. Witnesses claimed Snyderman arrived at Peasant Grill in Hopewell Boro, New Jersey, (pictured) wearing shades and sent a crew member inside . Dr Snyderman was spotted outside the restaurant by diners, where she is said to be a regular and a fan of their soups . Mukpo returned to Twitter on Monday to thank well-wishers for the 'good vibes' and say that he was feeling better. It also emerged this weekend that the freelance cameraman was facing half a million dollars in medical bills. A page on charity fundraising site, Gofundme, revealed he had raised close to $50,000 towards the cost of his treatment. An NBC spokesman said on Monday that the network could not comment on any individual case, but noted that the team was deemed to be low-risk upon its return from Liberia. He added that they had agreed to follow the guidelines set by local health authorities which included the 21-day isolation period. He said: 'We fully support those guidelines and continue to expect that they be followed. 'Our team are all well with normal temperatures, which they check multiple times a day, and they are also in daily contact with local health officials.' Meanwhile, in a phone interview with the Today show last week, Dr Snyderman said all the gear she and her crew used was being disinfected because they all shared work space and vehicles. Dr Snyderman (pictured while reporting in Liberia) was one of a group that had contact with Ebola patient Ashoka Mukpo, their cameraman . Dr Nancy Snyderman offered an apology on behalf of her whole team, in a statement to NBC News on Monday . Ashoka Mukpo was infected in West Africa a day into working for NBC but is being treated in Nebraska . Mr Mukpo said on Monday afternoon that he was feeling better and thanked well-wishers for their 'good vibes' She also said that she believed she and her team were at a low risk because they have been 'hyper-vigilant'. Hospitals across the U.S. remained on high alert on Tuesday over the outbreak of Ebola. Despite wearing protective clothing, a nurse in Texas was diagnosed this weekend with the disease after treating Thomas Eric Duncan, the first man to be diagnosed in the U.S. Nina Pham, 26, from Fort Worth, Texas was one of the team of medical staff at Texas Health Presbyterian where she treated Mr Duncan. She is now being kept in isolation at the same hospital and is said to be in a stable condition after also receiving a blood transfusion from Dr Brantly. Around 150 travelers per day from Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea will now be stopped and checked with contactless thermometers at JFK Airport in New York in an attempt to prevent the disease getting into the United States again. The 2014 Ebola outbreak has been most prevalent in three West African countries: Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone and smaller outbreaks have been reported in both Senegal and Nigeria. The new scheme will be expanded over the next week to Newark Liberty airport in New Jersey, Washington Dulles, Chicago O'Hare and Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson airport. Nina Pham, 26, is fighting for her life after contracting Ebola from Thomas Eric Duncan at the Dallas hospital .","Dr Nancy Snyderman acknowledged 'members of our group' violated the self-quarantine agreement .

"President Barack Obama sought to rally frustrated Latinos on Thursday with a firm promise to keep fighting for immigration reform and a renewed pledge to take executive action this year to reduce deportations of undocumented immigrants. After enraging many Hispanic voters last month by delaying a change in immigration policies until after the November midterm elections, Obama has faced widespread condemnation from a voting bloc that helped him win the presidency in 2008 and 2012. Latinos remain critical to Democrats' hopes of holding onto the White House, not to mention Obama's legacy, so the president said he would use the coming weeks to gin up support among the U.S. public for another shot at reform. Speaking at an annual gala held by Hispanic lawmakers, Obama said he shared the group's frustration but needed its support to make any reform last beyond his presidency, which concludes in a little more than two years. Rallying support: US President Barack Obama delivers remarks on immigration reform at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute's 37th Annual Awards Gala in Washington DC on Thursday . Heckler: A woman who was shouting at President Barack Obama as he addressed the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute's 37th annual awards gala is removed from the banquet hall in Washington . Angry: The activist, idenitifed as Blanca Hernandez of Washington D.C., was shouting remarks at Obama before she was escorted from the premises by security . Opinion: Hernandez  heckled Obama over lack of executive action on deportation during the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute Awards Gala at the Washington Convention Center . 'I know there's deep frustration in many communities around the country right now, and I understand that frustration because I share it,' he said at the Washington gala. 'But if anybody wants to know where my heart is or whether I want to have this fight, let me put those questions to rest right now: I am not going to give up this fight until it gets done.' Republicans in the House of Representatives blocked bipartisan immigration legislation passed by the Senate in 2013, and the Latino community has demanded Obama deliver on a promise to use his executive authority to ease deportations of some of the more than 11 million undocumented people in the country. Obama had promised to take that step before the end of the summer, only to delay it because of fears it could hurt Democrats running for election in conservative states in November. The president reiterated on Thursday he would take action before the end of the year, a pledge that irritated Republicans. 'The president’s promise isn’t about making the best policy or enforcing the law -- it’s an admission that his pledge to not uphold the law in the future would be bad for his party now,' said Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell in a statement. Obama's speech was interrupted by a heckler, identified as Blanca Hernandez, who gave him a hard time for failing to take executive action on deportations. But the rest of the crowd largely embraced the president, representing another twist in a relationship that at times resembles that of a married couple repeatedly squabbling and making up. Obama has missed the annual gala held by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus the last two years. Democratic Representative Luis Gutierrez of Illinois, a leading advocate for comprehensive immigration legislation, illustrated the difficult ties Hispanic-Americans have had with Obama during the past six years. 'It's clear that anybody that looks at this says, ''Wow, we weren't the priority we should have been and we weren't the priority he promised we'd be'',' Gutierrez said in an interview before the speech, while expressing hope that Obama's Thursday remarks would be a positive sign.","Activist Blanca Hernandez, of Washington D.C., called the President out on his lack of action on deportation .

"A Ukrainian women's rights group is calling for a 'topless revolution' in Tunisia after a Muslim preacher demanded a girl who posted naked pictures of herself online be stoned because she is an 'epidemic'. FEMEN, which regularly stages high-profile naked protests, is declaring April 4 the day of 'relentless topless jihad against Islamism' in a bid to jump-start a new Arab Spring for women's rights. Amina Tyler, 19, caused outrage in her native Tunisia last week when she posted topless photos of herself on her Facebook page. The naked truth: Amina Tyler, 19, caused outrage in her native Tunisia last week when she posted topless photos of herself on her Facebook page in a protest over women's rights . The teenager, who is an FEMEN activist, can be seen smoking a cigarette with Arabic words written across her chest in black that translates into English as: 'My body belongs to me.' It is unclear from reports in the Arab press whether Amina posted these photos while in Tunisia. Reports in Europe and the U.S. have stated that Amina has been taken by her parents to a psychiatric hospital in Tunis, which have been confirmed by FEMEN leader Inna Shevchenko in Paris. Tunisian media said that if Amina committed the offence in her own country, she could be punished by up to two years in prison and be given a fine between £40 and £400 pounds. Yet her act has caused conservative religious leaders there to take laws into their own hands. Recent reports claim that FEMEN's Facebook account was hacked and that one page been infiltrated with videos and pictures on the site with verses from the Koran. Extreme views: Salafist preacher Adel Almi (pictured) called for Amina to be 'quarantined' and stoned to death after comparing her to someone with a contagious illness . 'Thanks to God we have hacked this immoral page and the best is yet to come,' read one message signed by 'al-Angour,' an apparent hacker. Salafist religious leaders in Tunisia want Amina to be stoned to death. Tunisian newspaper AssabahNews quoted Salafi preacher Adel Almi, who heads the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, saying: 'According to God's law, she deserves 80 to 100 lashes, but what she committed is worth much more than that. 'She deserves to be stoned to death and she must be quarantined because what she did is an epidemic.' 'She is like someone suffering from a serious and contagious illness and she must be secluded and treated,' he added. FEMEN responded with a statement condemning 'barbarian threats of the Islamists' and said that April 4 will mark the 'beginning of a new, genuine Arab Spring, after which true freedom, freedom without mullahs and caliphs, will come to Tunisia! 'Long live the topless jihad against infidels!' before ending on a high note: 'Our tits are deadlier than your stones!' A petition and an international day of action on April 4 to highlight the threats against Amina have been organised by the group. More than 10,000 people have already signed the petition that called for those who threatened Amina's life to be prosecuted. A spokesman for Human Rights Watch said: 'The comments of the Tunisian preacher Adel Almi saying that Amina Tyler should be stoned to death could put her at serious risk of being harmed. Statement: A FEMEN protester is hauled away during a demonstration at the Italian elections last month . 'The Tunisian state should react at the very least by condemning these words and protecting her from physical assault, and investigate if the crime of inciting violence has taken place.' Last month, FEMEN brought together Iranian women in Sweden, who took to the streets of Stockholm demonstrating against the Hijab (Islamic headscarf). One of its leaders also recently condemned Elmar Brok, a powerful German MEP in the European parliament for seeking the services of Ukrainian prostitutes, an accusation which he has yet to deny. Tunisia is going through a period of turbulence with human rights a central theme of street demonstrations. Backlash: FEMEN is declaring April 4 the day of 'relentless topless jihad against Islamism' in a bid to jump-start a new Arab Spring for women's rights . Protesters on Monday demanded the resignation of Tunisia's minister for women's affairs, Sihem Badi, accusing her of defending a children's nursery where a three-year-old girl was raped, according to the French news agency AFP. The toddler was raped repeatedly by the caretaker of a nursery in a smart suburb of the capital, according to the police, which led to an arrest of the suspect. Yet early indications are suggesting that he may escape prosecution following the minister's comments which seemed to shift the blame to the family and hinted that he would 'no measures against the caretaker were needed' according to AFP. 'Three weeks ago, my life turned into a nightmare. When I imagine my daughter, who weighs 10 kilos, in the hands -- and on several occasions -- of this 55-year-old caretaker, I have only one wish, to die,' the father of the victim told the French news wire. 'The children's nursery is still open despite what happened to my daughter,' he added, his voice welling with emotion.","Amina Tyler, 19, posted naked images of herself on her Facebook page .

"Putting a minimum price of alcohol is illegal, the European Commission has warned David Cameron. The nine-page letter from Brussels to the Prime Minister says the scheme would break laws governing the free movement of goods. The Home Office proposal is to ban the sale of alcohol for less than 45p per unit in an effort to target heavy drinkers. 'Turn back': The European Commission warned Cameron that minimum pricing contravenes laws governing the free movement of goods . It will mean that wine cannot be sold for less than about £4.05 a bottle, beer will be at least 90p a can and a stand-size bottle of vodka will cost at least £11.70. The average family drinks bill will soar . by almost £100 a year under the Government’s plan for minimum pricing . for alcohol, it was revealed last night. In the leaked letter, the European Commission advised the Treasury to increase duty on alcoholic drinks if it wishes to raise the price, the Scottish Daily Mail revealed. The Government appears to be ignoring the legal warning, however, and is forging ahead with the plan, claiming it will save hundreds of lives and millions of pounds of public money each year by cutting crime and . health problems linked to binge drinking. Wine-producing nations such as France, . Italy and Spain are planning to take Britain to court for breaching the . EU law on free trade. Research has found that 59 per cent of all alcoholic units sold in off-licences and supermarkets cost less than 45p per unit – meaning their price will go up. Increase: An average family's drinks bill will rise by almost £100 if Government plans to increase the minimum price of alcohol . A couple who drink the average amount will see their annual grocery bill rise by around £94 a year. The finding by the respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) is a blow for the Government’s claim that the plan will target only binge drinkers. European officials have already written to Alex Salmond, the Scottish First Minister, to warn that Scotland’s 50p minimum price plan may contravene EU rules. The UK Government had gone to court to keep the embarrassing letter to Mr Salmond secret - now it emerges that they have had one of their own. Catherine Day, of the European Commission, explained that supermarkets would simply sell more alcohol to boost profits, and she said the plan would create ‘market distortions’. Miss Day said: ‘The UK authorities are invited to abstain from adopting the draft legislation at issue.’ The Government believes imposing a 45p minimum unit price will reduce total alcohol consumption by 3.3 per cent, and cut the number of crimes by 5,000 per year and hospital admissions by 24,000. There will be 700 fewer alcohol-linked deaths annually, according to the predictions. However, the IFS said that while ministers are right to say the heaviest drinkers will be the most affected by price rises, there will also be an impact on moderate drinkers. Those who drink less than seven units a week will see grocery bills rise, because 48 per cent of the units they buy tend to be less than 45p. The IFS research also found that one of the drinks most associated with binge drinking - alcopops - will hardly be affected by the minimum price at all, because it almost always costs more than 45p a unit anyway. Clash of opinion: Home Office minister Damian Green, right, said cheap alcohol contributes to 'harmful levels of drinking' while Catherine Day, left, of the European Commission, said the plan would create 'market distortions' In contrast, 72 per cent of the units . in lager sold in shops, 70 per cent of the units in spirits and 46 per . cent of units in table wine cost less than 45p and will therefore be . affected. They found that . if no one changes their habits in response to the price rises, the . minimum price will simply transfer £1.4billion from consumers to . off-licences and supermarkets. Miles Beale, of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association, said: ‘Minimum unit pricing and the proposed restrictions to promotions are wholly untargeted and will unfairly punish millions of consumers and businesses in the UK, while doing nothing to tackle the root causes of alcohol misuse or associated crime and disorder. ‘Alcohol misuse is a serious and complex problem for a small number of people in this country.’ The report confirms that low-income families will see the largest increases in prices, because they are most likely to buy cheap alcohol. And they say there is no evidence the plan will actually reduce harmful drinking. ‘The most important issue in determining the impact of minimum pricing will be whether those who generate the greatest social harms from their consumption drink less as a result of the policy,’ the report said. ‘That will depend on how well targeted on those drinkers a minimum price is, and how their consumption responds to price rises - something we know relatively little about.’ Home Office minister Damian Green told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘The evidence is clear - the availability of cheap alcohol contributes to harmful levels of drinking. It can’t be right that it is possible to purchase a can of beer for as little as 20p. ‘Too many of us have seen city centres on a Friday and Saturday night often become a vision of hell. A lot of this is fuelled by very cheap, very strong alcohol.’","Prime Minister wants to ban the sale of alcohol for less than 45p a unit .

"A man accused of defaced a portrait of the Queen in Westminster Abbey yesterday will appear in court today. Tim Haries, 41, from Doncaster in South Yorkshire, will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Friday charged with criminal damage over £5,000. The Fathers4Justice campaigner is accused of defacing to have scrawled the word ‘Help’ in turquoise paint across the canvas on Thursday. Protest: A portrait of the . Queen, left - commissioned by the Palace to mark the Diamond Jubilee - was . defaced at Westminster Abbey yesterday; the damage is pictured right . Arrested: Tim Haries, pictured, will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Friday . A man was allegedly wrestled to the ground by Westminster Abbey security guards and held until police arrived. The oil painting, by Australian-born Ralph Heimans, had been on show in the Chapter House for only a few weeks. Mr Haries, an electrical engineer, is said to have travelled to . London from his home in Doncaster to join a Downing Street protest by . campaigning group Fathers 4 Justice. He is separated from his wife Jenny and has two daughters aged 13 and ten. The Abbey has confirmed the incident, which occurred at lunchtime yesterday.  A 41-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of criminal damage, Scotland Yard said . A statement from the artist Mr Heimans was read out to the court in which he confirmed that the 11ft by 9ft painting was produced in 2012 during the Queen's Diamond Jubilee year . The attack took place as dozens of . visitors were in the Abbey at lunchtime. Mr Haries was arrested on . suspicion of criminal damage and taken to Charing Cross police station. It is understood the attack was caught on CCTV. A member of staff at the Abbey, who . did not want to be named, said: ‘The security guards need to take some . of the blame. They are meant to search people’s bags as they go through . the doors.’ Involved: Fathers 4 Justice has claimed that the protest was carried out by one of its members . Jolly Stanesby, of Fathers 4 Justice, . said the Queen’s portrait was chosen because her ‘badge’ is on the wall . of ‘every family court in the country’. He said: ‘We need equality in the family courts.’ The 9ft by 11ft painting depicts the . Queen in the Sacrarium of Westminster Abbey, also known as the . Coronation Theatre. It shows her, in a moment of solitary reflection, on . the spot where she was crowned. Staff have removed it from display . and hope it can be repaired with the help of Mr Heimans, who is based in . London. A spokesman for the artist declined to comment. Stunt: Fathers4Justice's most famous protest came in 2004, when Jason Hatch scaled Buckingham Palace dressed as Batman . A . spokesman for Westminster Abbey said: 'In an incident at lunch-time today a visitor to the . Abbey sprayed paint on the Ralph Heimans portrait of The Queen, . presently on display in the Chapter House. 'Until work can be done to remedy the damage it will – very regrettably – not be possible to have the painting on public view.' Buckingham Palace has refused to comment on the incident. Fathers 4 Justice was founded in the UK by Matt O'Connor, a marketing consultant, Following separation from his wife in 2000, Mr O'Connor became a prominent critic of UK family law after a court barred him from seeing his young sons outside of a contact centre. F4J's stated aim is to champion the cause of equal parenting, family law reform and equal contact for divorced parents with children. It is well known for its campaigning techniques of dramatic protest stunts, usually dressed as comic book superheroes and frequently scaling public buildings, bridges and monuments. Stunts have included supporters storming courts dressed in Father Christmas outfits, clapping the Children’s Minister in handcuffs, and group member Jason Hatch climbing onto Buckingham Palace dressed as Batman. Source: Fathers 4 Justice . The portrait of the Queen pictures . her in a moment of quiet reflection as she stands on the spot in . Westminster Abbey where she was crowned 60 years ago. Artist . Ralph Heimans said he sought to capture 'her humanity' in the 9ft by . 11ft portrait, commissioned by the Palace to mark the Diamond Jubilee. Her majesty posed for an hour-long sitting in the Yellow Drawing Room at Buckingham Palace in March. Mr Heimans then imagined the dramatic backdrop – the Sacrarium at Westminster Abbey, also known as the Coronation Theatre. She stands on the Cosmati pavement – a . spot where every English monarch has been crowned since it was . commissioned by Henry III in the 13th century. Mr Heimans, said: 'I hope there is a degree of humanity uncommon in traditional Royal portraits. 'I wanted her expression to be open to interpretation so that people could imagine what she was thinking at that moment, but I think there is a sense of tenderness and soulfulness, as well as nostalgia and contemplation. 'But there is also a suggestion of her inner strength. She has an extraordinary aura and a real energy and presence.' The painting is entitled The Coronation Theatre, Westminster Abbey: A Portrait of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. A spokesman for Mr Heimans said the artist was 'aware of the incident' yesterday, but would not be commenting further. Five people were arrested in the Palace of Westminster while protesting during a visit by Stephen Harper, the prime minister of Canada. Environmental campaigners against 'tar sands', a form of fuel which produces more emissions than conventional oil, have posted a video showing them on the roof of Parliament, with a statement saying they wanted to disrupt the premier’s address to MPs and peers. The 'Love Canada Hate Tar Sands' site said: 'We have entered Parliament to interrupt Harper’s speech. 'We have managed to climb onto the roof with t-shirts saying ""oil out of politics"", ""stop Harper"" and ""stop the tar sands"". Two campaigners have spilled molasses on the floor outside of Parliament.' Demonstration: Protesters outside Parliament during a visit by Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper . Controversy: Activists are angry about Mr Harper's support of developing energy from 'tar sands' Shortly before Mr Harper’s speech the doors slammed shut on the robing room, where the Queen puts on the Imperial State Crown and her ceremonial robes for the state opening of Parliament, and shouting was heard. In a separate protest, the UK Tar Sands Network held a demonstration outside Parliament as Mr Harper arrived, with around 50 people campaigning against extraction of oil from the tar sands in the boreal forests of Canada. The group wants the British Government to support EU measures which could label the tar sands as more polluting than conventional oil and discourage its future importing. Mr Harper’s speech to parliamentarians went ahead undisturbed and was attended by a number of high-profile figures, including Labour leader Ed Miliband and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. Talks: Mr Harper lavished praised on David Cameron during his speech to MPs and peers . The Canadian leader heaped praise on David Cameron during the address, telling Parliament he admired the Prime Minister’s 'determined and principled leadership' and valued the friendship between the two nations. The speech was followed by private talks between the two premiers. Scotland Yard confirmed that two male protesters and one female demonstrator were arrested shortly before midday for trespassing on a protected site after being found in a non-public area of the Palace of Westminster. They said two further women were arrested outside Black Rod's Entrance on suspicion of criminal damage. Police said they were aware of reports that appear to show the group on the roof.

"A pilot and his co-pilot have spotted a mysterious orange and red glow over the Pacific Ocean. The strange lights were spotted south of the Russian peninsula Kamchatka during the flight of a Boeing 747-8  from Hong Kong to Anchorage, Alaska. And while no explanation has yet been given, it's thought that they may have originated from the explosion of a huge volcano under the surface of the ocean. Scroll down for video . Strange lights have been spotted near the Russian peninsula of Kamchatka (image by Dutch pilot JPC van Heijst). The sighting was made by pilots flying from Hong Kong to Alaska. The glow came about 20 minutes after a vertical lightning bolt was seen . After the initial vertical lightning bolt it was thought the phenomenon could have been a thunderstorm, but that was ruled out when none were reported in the area. The predominant theory at the moment is that the lights were caused by an underwater volcano. Such eruptions are not unprecedented; on 21 November 2013 an submarine volcano famously created a new 'island' off the coast of Japan. Another explanation is they were caused by lights from fishing boats. Last week astronaut Reid Riseman was left baffled by a similarly bizarre green flurry of lights (shown below) off the coast of Bangkok. It is thought those lights were in fact created by fishing boats. The offshore illumination comes from enormous arrays of bright green LED lights used to attract squid and other sea life to the surface. However that explanation has been ruled out for the latest mystery glow, as more than 50 boats would be needed to produce light of this magnitude - but no fleet of fishing boats was thought to be operating in the area. Dutch pilot JPC van Heijst explained on PBase how, five hours into the ten-hour flight, they spotted an intense flash of light like a lightning bolt, directed vertically up in the distance. This was then followed by a deep red and orange glow 20 minutes later. And the experience left van Heijst somewhat perturbed, owing to the lack of an explanation for what happened. ‘Last night over the Pacific Ocean, somewhere South of the Russian peninsula Kamchatka I experienced the creepiest thing so far in my flying career,’ he said. There were no thunderstorms on their route or weather-radar, suggesting the lightning did not originate in a storm. The glow is also a mystery; similar lights have been spotted from squid-fishing-boats, but van Heijst says this ‘would not make sense in this area’. ‘The closer we got, the more intense the glow became, illuminating the clouds and sky below us in a scary orange glow, in a part of the world where there was supposed to be nothing but water,’ he continued. ‘The only cause of this red glow that we could think of, was the explosion of a huge volcano just underneath the surface of the ocean, about 30 minutes before we overflew that exact position.’ He was then nervous of encountering an . ash-plume in the middle of the night, but fortunately they did not . encounter anything of the sort. Before the flight they had heard via radio about earthquakes in Iceland, Chile and San Francisco. But . despite their being a few volcanoes on their route, they had had not . been alerted to any new activity - although this doesn't necessarily . include unseen underwater volcanoes. The strange lights (shown at the pink dot) were spotted south of the Russian peninsula Kamchatka during a flight from Hong Kong to Anchorage, Alaska (flight path in blue) Van Heijst ruled out squid-fishing-boats as the origin. He says the cause may have been an underwater volcano. An ongoing investigation is taking place to find out what happened . Together with his co-pilot van Heijst says they felt ‘everything but comfortable’, while no other aircraft were nearby to confirm the sighting. ‘We reported our observations to Air Traffic Control and an investigation into what happened in this remote region of the ocean is now started,’ he added. ‘Now I'm just hoping that if a new island has been formed there [from the eruption], at least it can be named after me as the official discoverer. ‘That would be pretty cool!’ ‘The closer we got, the more intense the glow became, illuminating the clouds and sky below us in a scary orange glow, in a part of the world where there was supposed to be nothing but water,’ said van Heijst . Around the Pacific Ocean is a region known as the Ring of Fire, where a large number of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur that may have been the origin of glow. The horseshoe shape is 25,000 miles (40,000 km) and, with 452 volcanoes, is home to more than 75 per cent of the planet's active and dormant volcanoes .","Strange lights have been spotted near the Russian peninsula of Kamchatka .

"Gerard Pique could clock up his 200th La Liga appearance on Saturday afternoon when Barcelona face Elche but he is also celebrating success off the field in his other life as a video game entrepreneur. The player’s interactive football game Golden Manager is now number one in the App Store charts just 24 hours after its launch. This is the first big project for Pique’s Barcelona-based small company of 30 staff, Kerad Games, and it has been a huge success. Gerard Pique (left) has a small gaming company and their creation Golden Manager in No 1 in the App charts . The game  allows players to be manager, chairman and owner of their own teams and play against friends across social media. It is played by some of the player’s Barca team-mates and by those no longer at the club such as Chelsea’s Cesc Fabregas. The business sideline doesn’t seem to be affecting Pique on the pitch. He has been one of Barcelona’s most consistent performers this season and if he starts against Elche this afternoon it will be game number 200 in his La Liga career. The 27-year-old made his debut in Spain on loan from Manchester United, at Zaragoza in 2006. He did well enough to convince Pep Guardiola to resign him from United for Barcelona in 2008 and he became the cornerstone of a side that won four leagues and two Champions Leagues. Former Barcelona ace Cesc Fabregas (left) is rumoured to be a big fan of the manager style game . Pique is currently one game from suspension and so coach Luis Enrique must decide whether or not to start with him with one eye on upcoming games against Villarreal and Athletic Bilbao. One man who will definitely not be rested is birthday boy Luis Suarez. The former Liverpool striker is 28 today and desperate to improve his scoring ratio against the team with the worst defence in the league. Coach Luis Enrique said in the build-up to Saturday's game: “Few strikers offer the movement that he does. It is not just about scoring goals it’s about linking play and dragging defenders out of position. I have no doubts he will also score a lot of goals.""

"The Obama administration released Khairulla Said Wali Khairkhwa and four other Taliban terror leaders to Qatari officials on May 31 in exchange for the safe return of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, a man now accused of desertion . In 2011 a federal judge ruled that one of the five Taliban terror leaders traded by the White House for Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl nine days ago was too dangerous to consider releasing, even if he had little chance of ever receiving a trial. The same Obama administration that downplayed the likelihood Khairulla Said Wali Khairkhwa could return to the battlefield against the U.S. argued three years ago that he should be denied habeas corpus rights and kept locked away in an orange jumpsuit at the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. The U.S. solicitor general's office, arguing on behalf of the president – the named defendant in a federal lawsuit – told the court that Khairkhwa was in the class of terrorists who were actively involved in the leadership of a group that killed Americans. U.S. District Judge Ricardo Urbina wrote that '[t]he . government contends that the . petitioner, a former senior Taliban official, is lawfully detained . because he was part of Taliban forces and purposefully and materially . supported such forces in hostilities against the United States.' He was also 'a member of the Taliban's highest governing body, the Supreme Shura,' the judge wrote, and 'was a close associate of Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar, who appointed him Governor of the province of Herat in 1999.' News of the apparent flip-flop in U.S. policy was reported by The Weekly Standard on its blog. Habeas corpus rights refer to the legal principle that prohibits the U.S. government from jailing citizens indefinitely without the benefit of a trial to determine their guilt or innocence. Goats were sacrificed and served up across Afghanistan as the Taliban celebrated the release into Qatar of five of its top Guantanamo Bay detainees as part of the prisoner exchange . Prisoners of war: 149 detainees are still held at Guantanamo Bay, and the Obama administration may be leveraging Bowe Bergdahl to begin clearing them out . Judges have repeatedly ruled that terrorists seized overseas and never brought into the U.S. aren't entitled to those rights since they can be considered prisoners of war. The Guantanamo Bay prison camp is located on a U.S. military facility in Cuba. Forty-three per cent of Americans believe it was wrong of President Obama to release five Taliban leaders in exchange for Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, while just 34 per cent approve. A USA TODAY/Pew Research Center poll released Monday found that Americans are split 50-50 on whether to be angry at Bergdahl or sympathetic toward him. The Idaho native stands accused of deserting his post before he was captured in 2009. Military veterans pulled no punches with the Pew pollsters. Just 6 per cent of veterans sympathize with to suspected deserter, and a large 68-16 majority believe Obama made the wrong call. Indications are mounting that Obama aims to clear out the remaining 149 prisoners there before he leaves office in January 2017, and took advantage of the Bergdahl hostage situation to start the flow of prisoners back to the Middle East. The president famously promised to close 'Gitmo' in 2008, and signed an executive order on his first day in office directing the Defense Department to shut it down. But the realities of the War on Terror, along with widespread public opposition to trying global terrorists in American civilian courtrooms, have poured cold water on his plans. Still, the White House has suggested that once American hostilities end in Afghanistan, Guantanamo prisoners linked to that country's Taliban forces should no longer be held captive. In 2011 Khairkhwa's taxpayer-funded attorney argued that he was a reluctant Taliban member and a small-potatoes operative. But Judge Urbina believed the government's evidence that the terror suspect 'had close ties with Mullah Omar,' the Taliban's leader, 'and that he remained one of Mullah Omar's most trusted associates before and after the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan.' In 2012 a federal appeals court agreed, dismissing the case. Khairkhwa was considered by the government to have been 'directly associated' with the late al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. And according to his detainee assessment at Guantanamo Bay, he was likely associated with al-Qaeda's late leader in Iraq, Abu Musab al Zarqawi. That assessment also described him as one of the 'major opium drug lords in western Afghanistan.' Mullah Omar called the hostage swap for Bergdahl a 'big victory' after his comrades were videotaped as free men in Qatar. That country's emir has pledged to keep all five tightly watched and keep them in the country for one year. Lawmakers in Congress have been critical of Obama's decision to free the men now collectively known as the 'Taliban Five.' The prize: Armed Taliban fighters took Bergdahl (R) to a rendezvous ponit with U.S. Special Forces for his pickup . Obama appeared May 31 with Bergdahl's parents, triumphantly announcing his safe return in exchange for five prisoners -- one of whom he argued four years ago was too dangerous to release . 'Mullah Omar just got his cabinet back,' Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain said Sunday on the CNN program 'State of the Union.' 'What we're doing here is reconstitution of the Taliban government,' McCain warned. 'These are the people who used to take women into the soccer stadium in Kabul and hang them from the goalpost.' Michigan Rep. Mike Rogers, a Republican who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, told ABC 'This Week' host George Stephanopoulos on Sunday that he is 'absolutely certain' at least three of the Taliban leaders traded for Bergdahl will rejoin the Afghan war and fight against Americans. Despite Obama's announcement that the U.S. war in Afghanistan is winding down, he plans to leave nearly 10,000 troops there through the end of 2015. 'We’ve already seen both in their rhetoric and their actions and, certainly, from the information that we see coming out from the Taliban including the Haqqani network in Pakistan [it] would suggest that’s absolutely going to happen,' Rogers said. 'Maybe not all five, but I do believe three for sure, likely four and that fifth one is on the fence – but will probably play some role in active operations with the Taliban. 'This was the wrong message at the wrong time, and we’re going to pay for this for years,' he added.","Khairulla Khairkhwa was part of the Taliban's highest governing body before the U.S. invaded Afghanistan in 2001 .

"The NSA is building a comprehensive facial recognition database through the intercepting of millions of photographs posted online everyday, according to a report from the New York Times published Saturday. According to the report, which cites top-secret documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, the NSA intercepts 'millions of images per day', which translates into approximately 55,000 'facial recognition quality images.' According to a 2011 document cited in the report, this is regarded by the agency as 'tremendous untapped potential'. The report also says that the implementation of a facial recognition program has accelerated under the Obama administration, after two thwarted terrorist attacks, the first attempted in 2009 by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a Nigerian, when he attempted to trigger a bomb hidden in . his underwear while flying to Detroit on Christmas in 2009. The second was in May 2010, when Faisal Shahzad, a Pakistani-American, attempted a car bombing in Times Square. Documents obtained from the leak by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden show that the NSA is attempting to develop a facial recognition database, culling approximately 55,000 quality facial images from millions of intercepted photos everyday . Farouk Abdulmutallab (pictured left) and Faisal Shahzad (pictured right), who both attempted terror attacks on US soil. These attacks reportedly prompted the Obama administration to allow the development of the NSA's facial recognition programs to accelerate . According to the documents cited in the report, the NSA has broadened the scope of their surveillance techniques, by focusing on collecting identifiers such as facial photos and fingerprints in addition to traditional oral and written communication. 'It’s not just the traditional communications we’re after' says one 2010 document, 'It’s taking a . full-arsenal approach that digitally exploits the clues a target leaves . behind in their regular activities on the net to compile biographic and . biometric information that can help “implement precision targeting.""' The NSA has so far had mixed results with the accuracy of their facial recognition technology. An NSA Powerpoint from 2011 reportedly demonstrated the facial recognition of an unidentified man, who appeared in different photographs in different as at times bearded, while other times clean-shaven. The slideshow presented several points of information about the man, such as his passports, visa, status on the TSA's no-fly list, and suspected relationship with terrorist groups. NSA Headquarters, in Fort Meade, Maryland. According to reports, the NSA is attempting to develop more sophisticated facial recognition programs to better identify individuals through photographs . However, the facial recognition algorithms used by the NSA have also been known to return with invalid results. In another 2011 document, the NSA's system processed a query using a photograph of Osama bin Laden. Results were returned with four other bearded men, who's faces only looked slightly like bin Laden. This revelation of the NSA's farming of images online to collect facial pictures is similar to the discovery earlier this year that the British GCHQ intercepted streamed webcam chats from users of Yahoo.

"President Barack Obama is calling tens of thousands of illegal-immigrant children languishing in temporary U.S. holding pens an 'urgent humanitarian situation,' but Republicans are pointing the finger of blame squarely at the White House. Obama instituted an immigration policy that the GOP says enticed tens of thousands of Central American children to cross America's southern border illegally without any parents to guide them. More than 33,000 have been picked up in Texas alone since October. The U.S. border patrol says its forces are overwhelmed, and the courts are bracing for a flood of immigration cases from children held in temporary detention facilities designed to handle a fraction of the numbers. Sanitation problems are beginning to rear their ugly heads. Obama rolled out a controversial Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program in 2012, allowing many illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as minors to escape deportation for two years. The White House gave them another two-year window last week. As a result, say some GOP leaders, America's system for handling illegal immigration has been strained to the breaking point and is attracting hundreds of new illegal-immigrant children every day. Compared to the year before Obama's policy took effect, twelve times as many kids are coming north illegally this year. Overflowing: The shelter at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas can no longer accommodate large numbers of children and mothers traveling with their kids, forcing the federal government to open more facilities and move many to Nogales for processing . Hundreds of immigrants believed to be in the country illegally from Central America and Mexico being held in crowded concrete rooms similar to a jail cell . Many of the children appear to be teenagers but some clearly are younger . Lackland has become a temporary shelter for youths caught crossing the border illegally and alone . A half-century-old section of a U.S. Air Force base in Texas is now a holding and processing center for . thousands of children who managed to enter the U.S. alone. The same is . true of a Navy base in California. And . a makeshift detention center in Arizona holding 700 illegal immigrant . children has ordered 2,000 mattresses to keep up with an expected influx . in the coming months. In a landmark court ruling in December, a federal judge ruled against the Department of Homeland Security for releasing a Salvadoran girl to her mother. The mom had hired a smuggler to transport her daughter into the U.S., and was herself in the country illegally. U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen wrote that 'this court is quite concerned with the apparent policy of the Department of Homeland Security of completing the criminal mission of those who are violating the border security of the United States.' 'The DHS,' Hanen added, 'should enforce the laws of the United States – not break them.' Many of the children there were sleeping on plastic boards. According to the Associated Press, toothbrushes and toothpaste hadn't arrived yet and were expected Monday. Hundreds of children had not bathed in days, and were taking turns using just four showers. Tony . Banegas, Honduras’ honorary consul in Phoenix, told the AP that there . were 236 Honduran children there on Saturday, including an 8-year-old. Republicans on Capitol Hill are beyond angry. Leaked . photos from the base, which were obtained by the Breitbart.com news blog, . show hundreds of children holed up in crowded concrete rooms, many of . them sleeping on the bare floor without blankets or pillows. 'The recent surge of children and teenagers from Central America showing up at our southern border is an administration-made disaster,' Virginia GOP Rep. Bob Goodlatte, who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, told Fox News last week. Should Obama's two-year 'amnesty' for illegal immigrant minors crossing the border be abolished? Should Obama's two-year 'amnesty' for illegal immigrant minors crossing the border be abolished? Now share your opinion . 'Word has gotten out around the world about President Obama's lax immigration enforcement policies and it has encouraged more individuals to come to the United States illegally,' Goodlatte said in a statement. 'Enforcement at the border and in the interior of the U.S.,' not 'another bureaucratic task force' is needed, he claimed. Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar, who sits on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said Friday that 'instead of having an application of the immigration law, we are taking mothers and children and dumping them ... and violating the rule[s] over and over.' Policy shift: President Barack Obama announced on June 15, 2012 that the U.S. would stop deporting young illegal immigrants who satisfied a broad set of criteria; the move has enticed tens of thousands of children to sneak across the border even though the policy doesn't apply to them . Immediately contentious: Neil Munro (C), the White House Correspondent for the Daily Caller, peppered Obama with unexpected questions during the announcement, during which the president hadn't planned to take questions at all . At the base, children are provided with three hot meals and two snacks a day. They can call home twice a week. They have access to mental health clinicians and on-site medical care . The minors flooding over the border are often teenagers leaving behind poverty or violence in Mexico and other parts of Central America such as Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala . The . Obama administration expects as many as 80,000 of these 'unaccompanied . minors' to cross the border in 2014, according to the Christian Science Monitor. That number is twelve times what it was in 2011, the year before Obama announced his deferred-action plan. The . administration now estimates the holding facilities where the . youngsters are being held cost taxpayers $252 per child per day, far . more than the cost of a hotel and more than the children could expect to . earn in two weeks of hard work picking crops, work that many were . slated to do. Facing the . question of whether to deport the minors or play a game of . catch-and-release, the administration has set aside $2 million to pay . for their lawyers. 'We're . taking a historic step to strengthen our justice system and protect the . rights of the most vulnerable members of society,' Attorney General . Eric Holder said Friday in a statement. 'How . we treat those in need, particularly young people who must appear in . immigration proceedings – many of whom are fleeing violence, . persecution, abuse or trafficking – goes to the core of who we are as a . nation.' Obama's 'deferred action' program for minors, which he announced in a fanfare-laden June 15, 2012 Rose Garden press conference, applies only to children who came to America before mid-2007. 'It makes no sense to expel talented young people, who, for all intents and purposes, are Americans,' the president said then. America has been left astounded by the shocking conditions these children have been kept in - conditions so dire that border control agents fear the spread of disease . About 850 that were being housed at the facility have been released to a vetted family member or a sponsor . Republicans blame President Obama for the situation, pointing to his 2012 policy that sent a message of hope to kids yearning to stay in the U.S. Photos leaked Thursday from a U.S. Border Patrol facility in the Rio Grande Valley show overflowing holding facilities of immigrants, many of whom are children . Over 400 children a day are coming and as many as 60,000 will cross the Mexican border illegally this year . But Capitol Hill is rife with fears that the message was garbled by the time it reach Guatemala, Honduras and other countries where poverty runs rampant. Many children traveling north on their own hope the policy will include them. That's . what 'coyotes,' the smugglers who bring them in, are telling them to . expect, according to Tania Chavez, a representative with La Union del . Pueblo Entero, told KRGV-TV. in southern Texas. The minors flooding over the border are . often teenagers leaving behind poverty or violence in Mexico and other . parts of Central America such as Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala. With the president traveling in Europe . last week, there have been no press briefings at the White House where . questions might be put to outgoing press secretary Jay Carney. But . Obama met privately Monday morning with a group of nurses from across . the country 'to discuss the importance of passing commonsense . immigration reform,' according to the White House. The Associated Press reported Monday that in a May 30 memo to the National Security Council's transborder security directorate, Border Patrol Deputy Chief Ronald Vitiello warned that the influx of unexpected illegals has stretched the border patrol beyond reason. But releasing them or reuniting them with family members in the United States would serve as 'incentives to additional individuals to follow the same path.' President Barack Obama said the sharp influx of unaccompanied children from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala was an 'urgent humanitarian situation' More than 33,000 minors were apprehended in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas since October last year, it has been reported . Republicans angered about the situation point to a federal judge who castigated the Obama administration for relaxing its immigration policy and encouraging human traffickers. In a December ruling, U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen ripped the Department of Homeland Security for releasing a Salvadoran girl to her mother – a woman who had hired a smuggler to transport her daughter into the U.S., and was herself in the country illegally. Hanen wrote that 'this court is quite concerned with the apparent policy of the Department of Homeland Security of completing the criminal mission of those who are violating the border security of the United States.' 'The DHS,' he added, 'should enforce the laws of the United States – not break them.' In a related case, the El Paso Times reported Monday that a Catholic charity was assisting 130 illegal immigrant children flown to El Paso, Texas. Many were traveling with their parents when they were apprehended trying to cross the U.S.-Mexico border. One Guatemalan woman named Maria, who enter the United States with her two children, told the Times that she wanted to go to Tennessee to reunite with her sister. Immigration officials, she said, had released her from custody and let her travel north. 'Immigration told me, ""You are free, you can leave"",' she said.","A San Antonio Air Force base, a California Navy base, and a makeshift detention center in Nogales, Arizona have become temporary shelters for children and youths caught crossing the border without their parents .

"Bob . Bergdahl's beard became the most controversial facial hair in all of . America, but now critics who accused him of looking like a member of the . Taliban can rest easy - he has shaved. Grown . in order to mark the time his son was in captivity as a POW in . Afghanistan, neighbors of Bergdahl in Hailey, Idaho, have said that the . former UPS truck driver is now clean shaven. This . comes as it was reported that Bowe Bergdahl is still refusing to speak . to his family, despite being sent a letter from his sister, as he . recovers in an Army hospital in Germany. Scroll down for video . Shaved: Bob Bergdahl (pictured with his wife Jani in May at the White House Rose Garden) has shaved his beard off to mark the release of his son Bowe Bergdahl . The . FBI is also investigating death threats that Bob Bergdahl and his wife . Jani have received from people furious about the deal that saw their son . released from Afghanistan in a prisoner exchange for five Guantanamo . detainees. Indeed, . despite sharpening up his look, from the moment the father of Bowe . Bergdahl took the stage with President Obama in the Rose Garden last . month it was clear the Bergdahl's were no average US military family. With . his long unkempt beard, seemingly anti-Government sentiment and an . apparent obsession with Afghan culture and language, Bergdahl infuriated . many with his use of both Pashto and Arabic language to thank Allah in . front of the President at the White House. Even . though Bergdahl says he changed his appearance to better understand the . Taliban who had captured his son, his appropriation of their culture . has struck some critics as too close for comfort. Bearded still: Jani and Bob Bergdahl, the parents of US Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, speak during a press conference at Gowen Field on Sunday, June 1, 2014, in Boise, Idaho on their return to their home state . Marking time with his beard: Bob Bergdahl, the father of an American soldier said he was proud of how far his son, Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, was willing to go to help the Afghan people at a press conference in Idaho earlier this month . The hosts of Fox and Friends and Bill O'Reilly in particular were infuriated at Bob Bergdahal and his actions. Co-host . Brian Kilmeade criticized Bowe Bergdahl's father for a controversial . tweet he sent and later deleted to a Taliban spokesperson, 'I am still . working to free all Guantanamo prisoners. God will repay for the death . of every Afghan child, ameen.' This . made Kilmeade furious, 'I mean, he says he was growing his beard . because his son was in captivity. Well, your son's out now. So if you . really don't - no longer look like a member of the Taliban, you don't . have to look like a member of the Taliban. Are you out of razors?' The . sight of Bob Bergdahl standing with the President did shock many . Americans unused to his facial hair, which bore some similarities to . that grown by devotees of Islam. However, what shocked them more was his use of Pashto and Arabic. Introduced by the president, Bob Bergdahl spoke mostly English, but his rudimentary knowledge of South Asian languages shocked. 'I'd like to say to Bowe right now, who's having trouble speaking English, bismillah al-Rahman al-Rahim,' he said. 'I'm your father Bowe. The people of Afghanistan, the same. 'To . everyone who effected this... throughout the whole of American . government and international governments around the world, thank you so . much.' Ready to go home: Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, sits in a vehicle guarded by the Taliban in eastern Afghanistan when he was freed by the Taliban on May 31, 2014, in exchange for five Afghan detainees held in the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba . Facial hair: Bob Bergdahl and Jani Bergdahl, the parents of captive U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, hold hands as they pray at the Bring Bowe Back celebration held to honor Sgt. Bergdahl in Hailey, Idaho last year . The . Arabic phrase bismillah al-Rahman al-Rahim appears prominently in the . Koran and means 'In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most . Merciful'. According . to Sara Carter, senior Washington correspondent for conservative news . network TheBlaze, the Taliban was thrilled to hear and see the press . conference. Others, however, said there was nothing so sinister in the former UPS delivery man's speech. After . his son was captured by the Taliban in June 2009, Mr Bergdahl said he . immersed himself in the language and culture of Afghanistan chiefly so . he could understand the captors, and speak to them from afar. He . said in a previous interview: 'I'm trying to learn a little Pashto so . that I can speak to people... I'm trying to write or read the language. 'I probably spend four hours a day reading on the region and the history.' Stefanie O'Neill, a Bergdahl family friend, added to CNN: 'Wouldn't you try and connect with the people that had your child? 'Bob . and Jani did everything possible they could to ensure Bowe's safety. And if Bob was trying to connect with them, it was to keep his son safe, . I'm sure.' Accompanied by President Barack Obama, Jani Bergdahl and Bob Bergdahl speak during a news conference in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington on Saturday, May 31, 2014 about the release of their son, U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl . As . their son recovers, Mr and Mrs Bergdahl have kept out of the public eye . after getting several death threats. Officials won't describe the . nature of the threats, but acknowledge that threats have been made. The Bergdahl have not been seen publicly since announcing with President Barack Obama that their son had been freed. 'We . are working jointly with our state and local partners and taking each . threat seriously,' FBI Special Agent William Facer told CNN in an e-mail . on Saturday. The . threats come in the wake of controversy coming from the families of . soldiers who were killed while supposedly looking for Bergdahl, who is . said to have deserted his post, which is what led to his capture by . Taliban forces in 2009. In . the past, Bob described a prisoner swap as a ‘win-win’ situation as he . would get his son back and the US would improve relations with the . Afghans. He has become an active anti-war campaigner and spoken out against drone strikes and Guantanamo. In . a video posted by the Guardian newspaper, Bob told photographer Sean . Smith: 'I don't work for the military. I don't work for the government. I . don't represent the American people. I'm a father who wants his son . back.' Some activists have picked up on other tweets from Bob, as well. In March, he wrote, '‘Democracy’ is a cult in the West' in response to a comment about the Afghan elections. He . also raised eyebrows when, in a press conference, he said the family's . hometown of Hailey, Idaho, 'We're so much like Afghanistan.' Robert Bergdahl also got criticism for this tweet, in which he called democracy a 'cult' Idyllic? This is the beautiful homestead of Bob and Jani Bergdahl in Hailey, Idaho. The Bergdahls hope Bowe will return here to a hero's welcome. But what were the circumstances of his release? In a . 2011 video message to Bowe's captors, Bob said: 'Strangely to some we . must also thank those who have cared for our son for almost two years. 'We know our son is a prisoner and at the same time a guest in your home.' Bowe’s brother-in-law spoke to MailOnline and what he said chimed with Chip’s comments. He denied that the Bergdahl family had sympathies with the Taliban and said that there was a ‘deeper story’ to emerge. Michael . Albrecht, a US navy pilot married to Bowe’s sister Sky said it was . ‘rubbish’ that Bob had any loyalties to the Taliban or Islam. ‘It . makes no logical sense,’ said Albrecht, 38, wearing his US Navy uniform . complete with a badge of the Black Knights, the elite fighter squadron. ‘He has no sympathies with the Taliban. Just because he speaks a few words of Pashto. ‘There are guys on my base that do that. You wouldn’t accuse them of having sympathies.’ Initial . euphoria over the release of Sgt Bergdahl, 28, America’s only prisoner . of war in Afghanistan, after five years has led to a growing backlash.","Bob Bergdahl has shaved his long unkempt beard off say his neighbors in Hailey, Idaho .

"Two Gonzaga University seniors are on the verge of being expelled after using a gun to defend themselves from a career criminal trying to break into their apartment. Erik Fagan and Dan McIntosh, who both live in an off-campus near the school’s Spokane, OR., campus, were accosted last month by a man demanding money while standing in the door of their apartment. Mr Fagan offered food and a blanket, but declined to give ex-con John Taylor any money, he told KHQ. Mr Taylor then tried to fight his way into the apartment but was scared off by Mr McIntosh’s hand gun. Troubled duo: Erik Fagan (left) and Dan McIntosh (right) face expulsion for using a gun to ward off an intruder . Explaining that he only opened the door because he thought it was a friend who had left only a few minutes prior, Mr Fagan told the station ‘[Mr Taylor] just asked me for money.’ ‘He just said I’m homeless, I’m looking for some money, can you help me out,’ Mr Fagan recalled. Angered by not getting any money, Mr . Taylor then tried pushing his way inside while telling the roommates he . was just out of prison, but Mr McIntosh had other plans. Scene of the crime: This is the Spokane apartment building Mr Taylor broke into . ‘He didn’t stick around to see if I was serious or not,’ said Mr McIntosh, ‘I was completely serious with that man. ‘I drew on Mr Taylor and Mr Taylor fled immediately,’ he further recalled to the station. Career criminal: John Taylor has a long rap sheet with seven prior convictions . Though the gun may have saved both men’s lives, it may have ended their academic careers at Gonzaga. ‘The university’s weapons policy forbids the possession of weapons… in both on-campus and off-campus housing,’ a spokesperson told the station. Mr Taylor had six prior convictions on his criminal record, and was arrested later that night on an unrelated charge, according to the station. But that did not stop Gonzaga’s board from going forward Friday with the process necessary to expel the two students from the school. Despite a likely expulsion being handed down as soon as this week, Mr McIntosh told the station he would do it again without hesitation. ‘My roommate’s life, my life, anybody’s life is worth an expulsion in my book,’ he said. When asked by the station how students are expected to defend themselves in the face of such a restriction, the school claimed campus security ‘is all over campus.’","Erik Fagan and Dan McIntosh, both seniors, were forced to defend themselves from an ex-con trying to break into their apartment .

"An 18-year-old Chicago high school student gave birth to a baby boy last Saturday then allegedly put him outside in a Walmart plastic bag to kill him 'because he looked like her ex-boyfriend and she was afraid her current boyfriend would leave her.' Ana Rosa Mora faces a first degree murder charge for allegedly killing her baby and later admitted to her actions after school employees and police became suspicious. The child was discovered along a gangway in North Hamlin last weekend in a plastic bag with its umbilical cord and placenta. Ana Rosa Mora, 18, allegedly murdered her newborn by putting it in a plastic bag and leaving it outside to die . The boy's body was discovered in the alley between two buildings in the 2700 block of North Hamlin Avenue last Saturday morning . The Chicago Tribune reports that staff members at Kelvyn Park High School where Mora was a student asked her about her recent birth and so she showed them a photograph on her ipad claiming it was her baby girl. Police later discovered the photograph was downloaded from the internet. Others became suspicious when Mora brought up the baby found near her home and asked if people would test for her DNA and the DNA of the baby, said prosecutors. When a police officer congratulated Mora on her child and asked her how old it was she said 'six months' in front of school staff who knew that she was lying. Assistant State Attorney Glen Runk said that Mora later admitted to police that she placed the baby in a bag in the gangway near her home at the 2700 block of North Hamlin Avenue. The Cook County Medical examiner's office determined that the baby who was found in a plastic bag with placenta and umbilical cord, was born alive and was killed by asphyxia. Judge Laura Marie Sullivan ordered in court on Saturday that that Mora be held on $500,000 bail. Mora's defense said that she was a good student and planned to attend college in the fall.

"Sajeel Shahid, 38, was allowed to establish a private primary school in Essex despite known links to extremists . An Islamic school set  up by a hardliner  who trained the ringleader of the 7/7 bombings is receiving money from the taxpayer, it emerged yesterday. Sajeel Shahid, 38, was allowed to establish a private primary school in Essex despite known links to extremists. Now the fee-paying school’s prospectus reveals that it claims nursery education grants which allow the parents of three- and four-year-olds to claim an annual discount of about £600 per child. The Government passes the public money on to councils, which then hand it to schools that are registered with Ofsted. Last night the Department for Education said it was ‘urgently’ investigating the latest claims at Ad-Deen Primary in Ilford. Officials said new powers were being introduced that would make it easier to bar unsuitable proprietors of independent schools. Ofsted added that it was ready to launch a snap inspection if requested. Anger is growing over the case, with critics questioning how Shahid was able to found the primary in 2009 despite background vetting by the DfE. Shahid, who has called for violence against British troops, was able to operate Ad-Deen for five years even though a special unit was also set up in 2010 to prevent individuals with extremist beliefs running schools. Shahid was sent to Pakistan in 2001 to set up a branch of the Al Muhajiroun group, the Mail on Sunday reported. In the same year, he gave a newspaper interview in which he said ‘jihad was the only solution for Muslim lands under occupation’. He added: ‘We say the Pakistan army, navy and air force should be fighting US and British forces which are killing our Islamic brothers and sisters in Afghanistan.’ The camp trained Mohammed Siddique Khan, the leader of the London terror attacks of July 7 2005 in which 52 people died. Controversial: The Ad-Deen primary school in Ilford, Essex . Others who attended the camp allegedly include convicted terrorists who plotted ten years ago to blow up the Bluewater Shopping Centre in Kent and London’s Ministry of Sound Nightclub. In 2005, Shahid was held in Pakistan for three months over suspected links to Al Qaeda. After being expelled from the country, he returned to Britain, where he was raised. He is said to be known to British security forces but has never been charged with any terrorism offences. However, once back in the UK, Shahid was given permission to set up the primary. He was registered director and proprietor of Ad-Deen, which teaches 54 pupils aged three to 11, although he is said to have resigned from the school earlier this month. Shahid is also thought to have helped teach children to recite the Koran and employed his brother, who also has links to extremism. Ofsted found the school was giving pupils a limited appreciation and respect for other faiths and cultures in 2011 – just over a year after it opened. A year later the education watchdog said it was meeting ‘all regulatory requirements’. MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said it is ‘extremely worrying’ that Shahid was in such a position. A spokesman for the Department for Education said yesterday: ‘It is vital that we ensure unsuitable people are not managing independent schools. 'We are introducing new powers to ensure that people whose past conduct demonstrates they are not suitable to run an independent school can be barred.’ Ofsted said it could carry out an emergency inspection if asked by the Department for Education. A spokesman added: ‘Children must be safe at school.’","Sajeel Shahid has established a private school in Ilford, Essex .

"A man who admitted posting online footage of himself dressed in a Ku Klux Klan costume to stir up racial hatred has been jailed for 12 months. Christopher Philips appeared at Wolverhampton Crown Court today, after previously pleading guilty to appearing in three YouTube videos last year showing him wearing the klansman outfit, and posing with a life-sized golliwog doll at a far-right gathering. Sentencing Philips, formerly known as Darren Clifft, Judge John Warner told him: 'It does not require advanced education or knowledge of history to know what you were seeking to convey might cause offence.' Christopher Philips (formerly known as Darren Clifft) admitted uploading a video on YouTube showing a person in a Ku Klux Clan costume hanging a life-size golliwog doll . He added the publication of the videos by Philips, who has Asperger’s, would obviously be 'thoroughly offensive' or 'highly inflammatory', leaving him with no choice but to jail the 24-year-old. Judge Warner told Philips, who it was earlier revealed was thrown out of the National Front for having views which were too extreme, that: 'On March 9, you went with others to a 'White Power Worldwide' demonstration at Swansea, taking with you a Klansman outfit purchased from America. 'You later travelled to another event where you were photographed and filmed dressed in the outfit, and hanging a life-sized golliwog.' Judge Warner went on to describe Philips’s 'admiration for the notorious figures' of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) as 'abhorrent'. He added: 'Your manifesto, written as Darren Clifft, stated that in your view democracy has been a failure and what is needed is dictatorship and you as the dictator. 'You set out a series of measures in that manifesto - measures of the most extreme nature which I will give no further publicity.' Judge Warner continued: 'In our democracy people are allowed to hold extreme, bizarre and offensive views. 'Parliament has passed laws like this one, under which you have offended, not to prevent or inhibit dissemination of those views but to prevent the dissemination of material which is threatening or offensive and likely to stir up racial hatred. 'By your guilty plea you admit that was your intention. In reference to the death of Philips’ father, who committed suicide shortly after his son’s arrest in March last year, Judge Warner added: 'I don’t for one moment hold you responsible for his death - but I have no doubt your behaviour caused him a great deal of concern and heartache.' Simon Davies, prosecuting, said that on March 12 last year, three videos showing a man in a KKK outfit hanging a golliwog doll were posted on YouTube on Philips’s account, named Ultimate Dazzler, with web links and video stills from that footage posted on his social media websites. He added that Philips travelled just a few days prior on March 9 to a White Pride Worldwide demonstration in Swansea, which had 'links with the far-right extremist organisations including the National Front and the English Defence League (EDL)'. Salute: Philips appeared to perform a 'white power'salute outside court (left) and the video clip (right) Mr Davies said Philips then travelled to a Blood and Honour event at the Valley Commando Motorcycle Club at Abercynon, where he was photographed and filmed in the KKK outfit, dancing, and posing with the doll. On March 26, following an investigation into the videos and other images posted on Facebook, police from the West Midlands counter-terrorism unit raided the house of Philips’s parents where he lived. The officers seized a laptop, a National Front membership card in the name of Darren Clifft, and a white KKK outfit, according to Mr Davies. Also uncovered were a pair of combat trousers, a flag bearing the slogan 'White Pride Worldwide' and a copy of a letter to a German acquaintance of Philips by Norwegian far-right extremist and mass-murderer Anders Breivik. There was also a newspaper clipping with the headline 'Nut warns of UK massacre', and a train ticket from Wolverhampton to Swansea. Philips was interviewed on three occasions, giving mostly 'no comment' answers until the last interview, said Mr Davies, when he started to tell detectives about his views. Philips, who it was heard has been carrying out voluntary work at his local church since his arrest, told officers: 'I just feel stronger towards my own; my own ethnic group - white people.' He freely accepted he owned a Klansman outfit, having bought it from Florida in the United States, and was the man wearing it in the online footage, according to Mr Davies. The prosecutor added Philips had been banned from attending another local church and also reported to police 'for his right-wing views' as far back in September 2011. Video: He distributed three clips  filmed at an extreme right-wing music concert on March 9 last year . He admitted posting the video footage, filmed by a friend, and then sending the links so that the footage could be seen by his friends. Mr Davies said Philips was 'excited' by having attended the Blood and Honour event 'as it was the first one he had been to' and he wanted to show people. 'He agreed to take the Klansman outfit and was encouraged to put it on at the event,' added Mr Davies. 'In terms of making the videos publicly available, he agreed he had done that and uploaded it (the footage).' Sentenced: He was sentenced to 12 months at Wolverhampton Crown Court today . In interview, Philips told detectives he 'didn't even think about anybody who might be offended' but had just wanted to 'impress his friends', said Mr Davies. Philips, who also belonged to a group called the West Midlands Infidels, was described as a man with 'no friends' and a loner, by his own defence barrister Theresa Starr. She said a psychiatric report had confirmed he had Asperger's syndrome, which meant he struggled to make friends and build relationships. 'He has always struggled to work out whether people are laughing with him, or at him,"" said Ms Starr.'He had no friends, and was bullied at a special school for pupils with Asperger's. He went to university and made no friends. 'He then developed this interest which led him to end up in this court today.' Ms Starr added: 'He believed the only people who admired him were his nationalist friends, which is why 'he behaved in that manner.' However, she said Philips now had a girlfriend who had brought stability to his life and had he now had 'no problem with race', adding he was now living alongside a gay lodger at his mother's house without any issues. Ms Starr said her client expressed remorse for what he had done, and apologised if what he had done had caused offence, adding he 'deeply regretted' his actions. During sentencing, Judge Warner also made Philips the subject of an anti-social behaviour order banning him from contacting three named individuals, as well as barring him from attending any extremist displays, posting or distributing extremist or racist material, putting up racist posters or making any racist gestures.","Christopher Philips pleaded guilty to wearing KKK outfit in YouTube videos .

"Former US solider 'Brett', pictured, has joined a Christian militia in Iraq to fight against ISIS . A 28-year-old former US soldier has returned to Iraq as part of a militia defending one of the world's oldest Christian communities under threat from terror group ISIS. The man, known only as Brett, is one of the leading foreign fighters in the Dwekh Nawsha Christian militia. He had previously served in the US Army in Baghdad between 2006 and 2007. Now, he is based in Al-Qosh, home of a mostly Christian population, which had been forced to flee into Kurdistan when ISIS fighters threatened to approach. Brett describes himself as a crusader' with a tattoo of Jesus with a crown of thorns on one arm and a machine gun on the other. He is also responsible for recruiting fellow foreign fighters. ISIS was never able to capture Al-Qosh, but much of the population, like that in Mosul, which had a large Christian community, has also been forced to flee. Speaking from the Dwekh Nawsha stronghold in the Kurdish city of Dohuk, he said: 'One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter. But here we're actually fighting for the freedom of the people here to be able live peaceably, to be able to live without persecution, to keep the church bells ringing.' The mass exodus that took place in mid-2014 has put the continued existence of one of world's oldest Christian communities into question. With Kurdish peshmerga fighters now clawing back land around Mosul, some Christians are keen to take up arms for their survival and Dwekh Nwasha is only one of several recently formed groups. Thousands of westerners have been recruited into the ranks of ISIS, but many of those end up as 'cannon fodder' or suicide bombers to assist more valuable Chechen fighters. In his first week with responsibility for recruiting foreign fighters, he has identified five volunteers from the United States, Britain and Canada. Each of the five men has previous military experience or worked as private military contractors. Brett's first recruit was a retired former US Marine from Texas called Louis Park. He said: 'I did not adjust well at peace time. I wanted to get back out here.' Brett continues to wear US Army fatigues but he is equipped with an AK-47 assault rifle with telescopic sight . Members of the Dwekh Nawssha Christian militia are defending their homes against possible ISIS attack . Brett, pictured on patrol, is now responsible for recruiting fellow foreign western fighters for his 'crusade' After serving in Afghanistan, Park says he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder 'and some other things' that barred him from combat deployments. As early as October 2014, he began saving money to join the fight against ISIS. Park says he travelled to Iraq to continue defending his country, even though Dwekh Nawsha - with barely a few hundred fighters in its ranks - sees little frontline action. He said: 'I'm patriotic as hell. If my government won't fight them I will.' The growing contingent of foreign recruits have a variety of reasons for joining Dwekh Nawsha. Andrew, an older man from Ontario, Canada, came because he heard about 'slaughterhouses' where ISIS allegedly cuts people up for organ trafficking. There is no evidence that such places exist but the rumour has been widely circulated by evangelical and anti-Islam organisations, especially in North America. Machine gun preacher: On one arm Brett has a tattoo of Jesus and on the other he has a machine gun . Among one of the first foreign recruits to be recruited by Brett, left, was Louis Park, right . Park, pictured, retired in December from the US Marine Corps and wanted to get back into the fighting . A video showing the beheading of 21 Coptic Christians by ISIS in Libya released on Sunday and entitled 'A message signed with blood to the nation of the cross' sparked a fresh surge of calls on social media for tougher Western action. One seven-year US army veteran called Scott said he was planning to join the Syria-based Kurdish 'Popular Protection Units' (YPG) until he found out they were 'a bunch of damn Reds'. Other foreigners in Dwekh Nawsha say they were turned off by what they see as the socialist streak in the YPG, an affiliate of Turkey's Kurdistan Workers' Party whose months-long battle against ISIS in Kobane attracted many volunteers. Thousands of Christians were forced to flee their homes after ISIS threatened to approach . Alan Duncan, a prominent British foreign fighter and veteran of the Royal Irish Regiment, recently left the YPG for similar reasons. He told AFP that an exodus of foreign fighters from the YPG has begun, naming several well-known volunteers currently fighting for the group he says plan to leave in the coming days. Jordan Matson, a former US soldier who has become the poster boy of YPG foreign fighters, argued that some volunteers may have lost their bottle when confronted with the intensity of the fighting in Kobane. 'Most of the Internet cowboys have come to realise this isn't a normal deployment. So they lose the stomach to come or stay.' Louis admitted that he had been diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress disorder by naval medics . Brett, right, said that he wants to protect Iraq's ancient Christian community and allow them to live in peace .","A former US solider is recruiting foreign fighters in the battle against ISIS .

"BMW's auto-park function has made life a lot more difficult for one Florida man after he says it malfunctioned and sent his car crashing into another vehicle.Jonathon Libratore, 27, told police he was trying to park his 2013 BMW in the Target parking lot in Stuart using the Park Assistant function when the car swiftly accelerated across a grassy island into - and onto - a car parked opposite. Libratore's infant son was in the back seat of his BMW but was fortunately unharmed in the accident. Parking fail: Jonathon Libratore's BMW zoomed across the grassy area dividing the parking lot and onto another car . Needing assistance: Both cars had to be towed after Jonathon Libratore's BMW crashed into a parked car . The crash happened just after 5pm Tuesday. According to ABC News, both cars had to be towed from the scene. BMW's Park Assistant function helps drivers find parking spaces of the right size and 'actively supports the driver during parking, taking care of gear selection, steering, accelerating and braking.' BMW has defended the parking function, saying it's designed to help drivers with parallel parking but does not control the speed of the car. No injuries: Libratore's infant son was i the back of his BMW but emerged unscathed . 'The system does not control the speed of the vehicle at any time,' BMW North America spokesman David Buchko told ABC News. 'The driver controls the speed of the vehicle with the accelerator and the brake.' Marin County Sheriff's Office posted pictures of the dramatic crash to its website, where commentators questioned Libratore's story, suggested that the driver accidentally hit the accelerator instead of the brake. Marin County deputies are investigating the cause of the crash.","Florida man Jonathon Libratore used the Parking Assistant function to park his BMW at a Florida Target .

"A fired Oklahoma City nursing home worker was arrested for threatening to cut off a co-worker's head  - the day after a Muslim convert allegedly beheaded his colleague just 20 miles away. Jacob Mugambi Muriithi, a Kenyan native who claims he 'represents ISIS,' made the threats at Bellevue Nursing Home, in Oklahoma City hours after Alton Alexander Nolen was named as the suspect in the brutal murder at Vaughan Foods. The 30-year-old Muslim allegedly told the victim he was going to cut her head off with a blade and then post the footage on Facebook while they were working together last Thursday. Jacob Mugambi Muriithi (left), a Kenyan  who claims he 'represents ISIS', was arrested hours after Alton Alexander Nolan (right) was named as the suspect in a beheading 20 miles away . According to The Oklahoman, the victim who has not been named, then asked Muriithi why the group killed Christians and he reportedly said: 'This is just what we do.' A detective investigating the case wrote: 'The victim said Jacob asked her what time she got off work and she replied by asking him in a joking manner if he was going to kill her. 'Jacob told the victim, ""Yes,"" he was going to cut her head off. The victim asked Jacob what he was going to cut her head off with and he said, 'A blade,' then told her after he did it he was going to post it on Facebook.' They added: 'The victim said Jacob was serious when speaking and never made any statements that he was joking or playing around.' He was arrested the same day and is now being held on terrorism charges in Oklahoma County Jail with his bail set at $1million. The 30-year-old is said to have told the victim at Bellevue Nursing Home, Oklahoma City, that he would cut off her head with a blade and post the footage on Facebook . Alton Nolen, 30, is expected to be formally charged with murder following the murder of Colleen Hufford, 54 at Vaughan Foods in Moore on Thursday. Her and Traci Johnson, who was also stabbed but survived the attack, apparently were targeted randomly at the facility. He is said to have returned to the scene hours after he was fired from his job. Alton Nolen was shouting Islamic phrases as he tore across the store wielding a knife, it has been claimed. He was trying to convince workers that Islam teaches that the punishment is acceptable on Thursday, shortly before he was fired from his job, according to local media. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is also looking into Nolen's background for any potential religious ties to the attack after former colleagues said he had attempted to convert them to Islam. Police said Nolen had recently become a Muslim. Hufford, who had been married for 25 years, had lost her family home in the Moore tornado, reports suggested today. Alton Nolen is accused of killing Colleen Hufford, 54, and stabbing Traci Johnson, 43, who apparently were attacked randomly at the facility in Moore on Thursday . The 30-year-old, who refers to himself as Jah Keem Yisrael on his Facebook page, is said to have stabbed and killed a colleague hours after he was fired . It was also revealed that Nolen had served less than two years of a six-year prison sentence for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, according to the The Oklahoman. According to records he went to prison March 10, 2011, to start a two-year sentence for marijuana possession and another two-year sentence for assaulting a highway patrol trooper, the website reported. He began his six-year sentence for cocaine possession April 26, 2011, records show - due to plea agreements with prosecutors, he was allowed to serve the three prison sentences at the same time.","Jacob Mugambi Muriithi, 30, worked 20 miles away from beheading scene .

"The latest suspected ISIS propaganda film has been uploaded to YouTube and appears to feature a jihadist with an American accent. The 55-minute 'Flames of War' video was posted online today and bears hallmarks of previous Islamic State tapes including Hollywood-style effects and bloodthirsty, call-to-arms language. The clip bears the stamp of the al-Hayat Media Centre, ISIS' English-language propaganda arm. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . An ISIS jihadist spoke with an American accent on the Flames of War propaganda film which was uploaded to YouTube today. In the video, the masked extremist stands before Syrian soldiers, loyal to dictator Bashar al-Assad who are digging their own shallow grave outside the city of Raqqa . A male voice in well-spoken English with a non-specific American accent provides the voice-over, using dialogue seemingly hijacked from a blockbuster action film. He says: 'In the face of the dark wave of the crusader force, the historical land of two rivers bore life to a mission that would transform the political landscape of the world.' Almost an hour follows of battle scenes where militants wield rocket launchers, the footage manipulated with special effects. Piles of bloodied corpses are spliced with speeches by President Obama and former president George W Bush. The tape builds to shaky camera footage of the extremists' raid on the 17th Division air force base in Raqqa, Syria under the cover of darkness. In the final minutes of the tape, a masked jihadist in desert fatigues, speaks directly to camera in a different American accent to the man who provided the voice-over. An ISIS flag billows as Syrian soldiers, loyal to dictator Bashar al-Assad, dig their own shallow shallow graves in the sand. In a deep voice, the ISIS militant, who appears tall and well-built, speaks first in Arabic before transitioning into fluent, well-spoken English to deliver a chilling message. He said: 'We're here in the 17th division military base just outside the city of Raqqa. In the chilling tape released on Friday, ISIS line up the Syrian soldiers captured during an attack on an airbase in Raqqa . In the sickening footage, the soldiers are shot in the back of the head by the ISIS militants, their bodies rolling into a shallow grave . 'We're here with the soldiers of Bashar, you can see them now digging their own graves where they were stationed. The very place they were stationed, terrorizing the Muslims in Raqqa. He goes on to say that the work of Allah will be carried out on the soldiers by the mujahideen who captured them. 'This is the end that they face,' he said, gesturing to the men digging in the sand. The tape then cuts to a captured soldier holding a shovel in a pit who says: 'Today we're digging our graves with our own hands... Our fate is to be slaughtered.' He said that ISIS with just a few dozen soldiers were able to take over the 800-strong Syrian army base. The tape ends with the American-accented jihadist brandishing a handgun and saying: 'The fighting has just begun.' A line of masked ISIS militants then shoot the kneeling soldiers  in the back of their heads, the bodies pitching forward into a mass shallow grave. As many as 40 Americans have returned to the U.S. after fighting for the ISIS terror army overseas and are under investigation by the FBI. Democratic Rep. Tim Bishop made the remarks during a speech to Long Island Metro Business Action on September 12. 'One of the concerns is the number of U.S. citizens who have left our country to go join up with ISIS,' he said. 'It is believed there have been some number up to 100 that have done that.' 'It is also believed that some 40 of those who left this country to join up with ISIS have now returned to our country. Those 40 are under FBI attention and surveillance. So they are known and they are being tracked by the FBI.' American jihadis, part of a swelling 'foreign fighter' contingent aiding the self-designated Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) could put their ideologies and experience to work in the United States, a fact that has some in Congress clamoring for easier ways to revoke their citizenship. The Pentagon said two weeks ago that only about a dozen Americans had left the country to join up with ISIS, while as many as 100 are suspected of taking up arms with a wider range of Islamist extremist groups in the Middle East and Africa. DAVID MARTOSKO . MailOnline is not running the full video. The U.S. State Department had yet to comment on Friday when contacted by MailOnline about the authenticity of the tape and the suspected involvement of an American. Just days ago, ISIS had released a similarly slickly-produced 'Flames of War' trailer warning the U.S. of the carnage it wants to inflict in Iraq if President Obama deploys troops to the war-torn nation as he attempts to 'degrade and ultimately destroy' the terror group. Timing of the trailer and the feature-length film, suggested ISIS were directly responding to General Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who told the Senate Armed Services Committee this week that fighting in Iraq may require the use of ground troops. The trailer was also released by the al-Hayat Media Center, which has become known for its propaganda videos for ISIS which include high-production values, CGI explosions and slow motion footage. The movie is just the latest heavily-edited video from ISIS that has included gruesome footage of the beheadings of two American journalists and a British aid worker. In the latest hostage video released on Thursday, British photojournalist John Cantile sits behind a desk and in a measured tone makes the case for Western powers to negotiate with his captors. His appearance is very similar to that of fellow British hostages Alan Henning and David Haines, who were seen in a video released by ISIS earlier this month. The footage taken of the other hostages, including American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, was characterised by the masked figure of 'Jihadi John'. He - and his weapons - are absent from the video of Mr Cantile. The 55-minute long, 'Flames of War' video was posted online today and bears similar hallmarks to previous Islamic State tapes including Hollywood-style effects and bloodthirsty, call-to-arms language .","The 55-minute long, 'Flames of War' video was posted on YouTube today .

"The traditional bedtime story is dying out as a new study shows a third of parents never read their young children a story at night. Just 64 per cent of those with children under seven read to them at all. And of those, a mere one in five get a book out every night. The average child gets three bedtime stories a week, but five per cent do not own a single book (picture posed by models) The study shows the average modern day child gets three bedtime stories a week. But a quarter of a milllion children aged seven or under, or just under five per cent, do not own a single book. In contrast, 91 per cent of those parents said they were read regular stories as a child, according to the research by online family retailer Littlewoods.com. This has clearly had an impact as the vast majority of parents admit they see the importance of the bedtime ritual. Unfortunately, it seems many struggle to get their children interested in books. Atomic Kitten star Natasha Hamilton is helping launch a children's bedtime story competition - pictured here with husband Riad Erraji and sons Harry and Josh two years ago . The study found that nearly half of kids would much rather watch TV, play with toys or computer games. Meanwhile, 13 per cent of parents blame a lack of time for not reading to them and 9 per cent claim they are 'too stressed'. Yet three quarters of them were read to every night of the week as children. In light of the findings, Littlewoods.com has teamed up with pop star Natasha Hamilton to launch a children's bedtime story competition. Children aged up to seven enter by creating their own tale as an illustrated storyboard showing their adventures with a magical friend. Atomic Kitten star Natasha, 31, said: 'As a mum of three, I know just how enjoyable reading bedtime stories to my kids is. 'Alfie is only three, so he especially loves me putting on different silly voices when I'm telling him stories before bed. 'I'm really excited to see all the different story ideas and can't wait to see what the kids come up with. Choosing a winner's not going to be easy.' In contrast, businessman David Hodges, 48, admits he struggled to find time to read to his two children. Mr Hodges, of Southampton, Hants, said: 'I tended to get back too late from work and the children were already in bed. 'If they were lucky their mother had time to read them a story but it could be a real struggle to get them both fed and ready for bed in time.' Gary Kibble, Retail Brand Director at Littlewoods.com, said: 'We appreciate how important it is for parents and kids to spend quality time together, and bedtime stories are a great way to do just this. 'The fact one in three parents feel they could and should spend more time reading with their kids felt like the perfect opportunity to launch this new campaign. 'The more excited we can get children and parents about writing and drawing, hopefully the more they will want to read together at home.'","A study found that nearly half of kids would much rather watch TV, play with toys or computer games .

"A priest was among at least 16 people killed today after the second earthquake to strike northern Italy within nine days caused his church to collapse and toppled scores of other buildings. Father Ivo Martini died after he and a firefighter went inside his church in Rovereto di Novi, near Modena, to recover a Virgin Mary statue following this morning's 5.8 magnitude tremor at 9am. He perished in a subsequent masonry collapse during one of the four other aftershocks measuring above 4.0 that also hit the industrially important Emilia Romagna region during 90 terrifying minutes. Scroll down for video... Rubble: The shell of the 500-year-ld cathedral in Mirandola - not where Father Ivo Martini died - after the quake .

His church, Santa Caterina, was one of several religious  buildings that were badly damaged after being weakened by the May 20 earthquake in Emilia Romagna that left seven people dead. The 16th century cathedral in Mirandola, which was cracked following the last major quake, was destroyed in today's tremor. Rubble now surrounds the altar of the cathedral, the wooden pews crushed like matchsticks under tons of masonry, after the roof fell in. Another priest in Carpi is believed to have been rescued from rubble after his church collapsed. The injured included a 65-year-old woman who was pulled out alive by rescuers after lying for 12 hours in the rubble of her apartment's kitchen in Cavezzo, another town hit hard by the quake. Firefighters told Sky TG24 TV that a piece of furniture, which had toppled over, saved her from being crushed by the wreckage. She was taken to a hospital for treatment.

Nearby Modena, which is known for its Balsamic vinegar and is at the centre of famous culinary region, was again the epicentre for today's earthquake. The tremors toppled buildings across the area, the home of Parmesan cheese, Parma ham, Ferrari cars and singer Luciano Pavarotti. The region is among the country's most productive and the earthquake risks worsening its recession and making the job of tackling its massive debt problem even harder. The two recent earthquakes are particularly surprising because the region lies in the middle of the Po plain, which is traditionally considered safer than other areas of seismic Italy. The quake was the most deadly to strike Italy since 2009 when a tremor partially destroyed the central city of L'Aquila, killing about 300 and leaving thousands homeless. Among the towns to be badly hit today was San Felice sul Panaro, where at least three people died when a factory collapsed. Two of the victims have been named as immigrants Pawan Kumar, 31, from India and Azaar Mohamad, 45, of Morocco.  Both men were married fathers. The third dead man is Italian.

Severe danage: The collapsed BBG industrial moldings building is seen in Mirandola . Damage: A factory in San Felice in the Emilia Romagna region that collapsed, killing three, in today's earthquake . Tears: Factory workers grieve and console each other outside the Meta factory where three workers died . Help: Firefighters arrive at a factory which was damaged in an earthquake, in San Felice . As rescuers across the region clawed at rubble to reach survivors, Italian Premier Mario Monti pledged to do 'all that it must and all that is possible in the briefest period to guarantee the resumption of normal life in this area that is so special, so important and so productive for Italy.' Other victims included those residents still living in tents following the last quake. They were forced to flee again when they felt the ground shaking this morning. The official death tolls stands at 15 people, but there were fears that others had also been killed by falling masonry. The quake was felt across the whole of Italy with people running into the streets as far away as Milan Venice, Genoa and Perugia with shocks also felt in neighbouring Austria. Panic: Patients wait outside a hospital in Crevalcore after being evacuated from buildings . Bricks: Debris from a collapsed building lies in a courtyard in  Mirandola . Emeregency: A volounteer helps people evacuate the Tesoreria Comunale and Marino Palace offices in central Milan, where the tremors were also felt . Falling balls: A large ornament fell from the Voto Church in Modena . Toppled: Rescue workers patrol a damaged factory in Medolla near Modena - the epicentre of the quake . Grim task: Rescue workers scour rubble in Medolla for signs that anyone could be buried underneath . No shelter: People are evacuated from their homes in Mirandola . A spokesman for the Italian Geophysical and Volcanology Institute said that there had been a series of five aftershocks in the thirty five minutes after the main earthquake measuring between 3.1 and 4.0 on the Richter scale. Alessandro Amato of the Institute said: ‘It looks like a new fault line has broken - this earthquake happened just 40km west of the initial one earlier this month.’ Train services north of Bologna, major junction in the Italian network were also disrupted with services from the city to Milan, Venice and Verona being affected. Mobile networks were also affected with communication in and out of the affected area sporadic as frantic relatives and friends tried to call loved ones across a wide swathe of northern Italy. Terrified locals fled into the streets in the city of Bologna as shops, schools, offices and factories emptied while other neighbouring towns and cities ordered immediate evacuations of all public buildings. Hit again: It is the second earthquake to strike northern Italy in little over a week. This clock tower at Finale Emilia was torn apart in the tremor on May 20 . Epicentre: The earthquake struck near the city of the Modena, in northern Italy, with tremors felt across the region . Three of the dead were workers at a factory in San Felice, while two workers were thought to have been killed in Medolla near Modena after a warehouse collapsed. Fernando Ferioli, the mayor of Finale Emilia, which was also severely damaged in the earlier earthquake said: ‘It's a disaster here. There have been fresh collapses. This is another earthquake it is not an aftershock.’ After the initial earthquake earlier this month at least 5,000 people were made temporarily homeless and put in makeshift tents and today civil protection teams were once again heading into the area to set up accommodation.

"A couple have been charged in connection to the savage murder of a Minnesota college student whose body bearing 22 knife wounds was found dumped in a field last fall. Shavelle Chavez-Nelson, 32, and Ashley Marie Conrade, 24, were both charged Friday with second-degree intentional murder in the slaying of 20-year-old University of Minnesota student Anarae Schnuk. The victim was reported missing September 23, 2013. A week later, her naked body turned up in a ditch next to a cornfield in Rice County. Justice for Anarae: Shavelle Chavez-Nelson, 32 (left), and his girlfriend Ashley Conrade, 24 (right) have been charged with murder in the stabbing death of 20-year-old Anarae Schnuk last September . Slaughtered: Schnuk, a student at University of Minnesota, was found dead from 22 stab wounds in a ditch September 30, 2013 . According to Dakota County Attorney James Backstrom, on the night of her death Schnuk was with Chavez-Nelson, her former boyfriend, and Conrade, his current girlfriend. Investigators still do not know which of the two suspects stabbed Ms Schnuk, but they say it does not matter because they have enough evidence to prove that both were responsible for causing her death, Minneapolis Star Tribune reported. First victim: Nelson allegedly shot and killed Palagor Jobi, 23, the night that Anarae Schunk vanished in Burnsville, Minnesota . Just hours before Schnuk was stabbed to death, the 32-year-old man allegedly shot dead Palagor Jobi at a Burnsville bar. On Friday, Nelson and Conrade appeared in a Hastings courtroom. The 32-year-old was brought before a judge from prison, where he is serving a nine-year sentence for an unrelated burglary. A public works crew came upon Anarae Schnuk's body September 30, 2013, while mowing ditches near an 80-acre field in Londsdale. An autopsy of the woman's body . revealed that the knife used in the murder severed Schnuk's carotid . artery and jugular vein, and she likely died within 20 seconds. Schnuk also suffered a number of defensive wounds to her hands proving that 'she fought for her life,' said Backstrom. Officials working on the case said they have found ample DNA evidence on items Nelson had brought to the home of his estranged wife in St Paul after the killing. The recovered black plastic bags contained Schnuk's white UMN jacket covered in blood and bearing more than 20 holes in it and other items of clothing, which looked as if they had been cut off a body. Police also recovered Nelson's socks and Conrade's flip flops, a pair of bloodied yellow gloves and gory towels. All the items reeked of bleach. The alleged murder weapon, an 8-inch knife, was found on the roof of the building, police said. Ms Schnuk was last seen outside Nina's Grill with her ex-boyfriend and Conrade, 24, of Rosemount, in the early hours of September 22. Police believe she asked to meet with Nelson to talk about the $5,000 he owed her. Grisly clues: Police found a bloody whlte jacket belonging to the UMN student with 20 holes in it, along with the suspects' clothing, inside bags that Nelson brought to his ex-wife's home . The night took a violent turn when police say Nelson shot dead Jobi, 23, outside the bar. The altercation . occurred after victim started talking to Nelson's current girlfriend, . Ashley Conrade. Conrade would later tell police that she too was jealous and angry that night seeing her boyfriend put his arm around Schnuk in front of her, reported TwinCities.com . After the shooting, Schnuk and the couple returned to Conrade's townhouse in Rosemount, where police believe the 20-year-old was killed sometime between 3.30am and 4.30am. When initially questioned by police , Conrade denied killing Schnuk or knowing what happened to her. Days later, she changed her story, admitting to investigators that she had seen Schnuk's body on her kitchen floor when she came home from work on the night of September 22. The 24-year-old woman also revealed that she helped her boyfriend, Nelson, carry a plastic tub containing Schnuk's body to her car, where the trunk had been lined in advance with black plastic bags.

Follow the money: Police say the 20-year-old wanted to meet up with Nelson to discuss the $5,000 he owed her . Nelson . was eventually cornered by police in a gravel quarry and forced to surrender, reported Shakopee Valley News. According . to court documents, he was released on bail a week before his September 2013 . arrest for burglary and weapons charges. Anarae Schnuk, an accomplished chess player, met Nelson at a bus summer in the summer 2012. He lied to the college student that he was a stock broker. When Schnuk learned the truth about his criminal past, she stuck by him, believing she could help him turn a new leaf. She broke up with him a few months later when she discovered that Nelson had been living with a . woman and the pair had a child together. Kind soul: Schnuk wanted to help Nelson turn his life around after discovering that he was an ex-convict and not a stock broker like he had told her . Star-crossed affair: Anarae, an accomplished chess player, met Nelson at a bus stop in 2012; he lied to her that he was a stock broker . 'She was a lovely, intelligent and kid-hearted woman,' said the county attorney. Not . long before her murder, the UMN student got in touch with him as her . owed her $5,000 from when they were dating and she wanted the money . back. Ashley Conrade is being held on $2million bail without conditions and $750,000 with conditions. No bail has been set for Nelson since he is already incarcerated. They are due back in court July 11. Nelson is also facing first-degree premeditated murder and second-degree murder in Jobi’s killing, while Conrade is accused of aiding an offender after the fact in that case. Speaking of the charges against the couple, Anarae’s brother Owen Schnuk said it was ‘another step forward’ for their family.

"More than a billion people are long-sighted and suffer blurry vision when they try to carry out simple tasks like reading a book. But a new procedure could provide an alternative to reading glasses for people with the age-related condition presbyopia. It involves slicing the eye open and inserting a tiny lens under the cornea, the clear film that covers the front of the eyeball. More than a billion people are long-sighted and suffer blurry vision when they try and read a newspaper, for example. But a procedure could prove an alternative to reading glasses (stock image) for people with the age-related condition, called presbyopia by implanting an inlay into their cornea . Researchers told the annual meeting of the American Academy of Ophthalmology that the implanted  doughnut-shaped inlay improved near vision for 83 per cent of volunteers over the age of 40. They said that after the operation, the majority of patients were able to read a newspaper without the aid of reading glasses – and the inlay didn’t disturb far distance vision needed for daily activities, such as driving. The Kamra inlay measures 3.8 millimetres in diameter and has a 1.6 millimetres hole in the centre. It is undergoing clinical review. Presbyopia affects more than one billion people worldwide - mostly over the age of 40. As people age, the cornea becomes less flexible and bends in such a way that it becomes difficult to see up close. While the most common remedy is wearing reading glasses, a host of new corneal inlay products are in development to treat the condition, with three types currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The theoretical advantage of using corneal inlays over wearing reading glasses is that corneal inlays prevent the need for constantly putting on and taking off glasses, depending on whether the person needs to see near or far. However, all three inlays require an operation. The procedure involves the eye being sliced open and a Kamra lens inserted into the cornea. There are already alternatives on the market, such as the Raindrop lens (illustrated) which is also inserted into a patient's eye during a medical procedure. The operation to insert the implant lasts 10 minutes under local anaesthetic. The new technique could replace laser eye surgery (stock image) which can leave some patients still needing glasses . So far, clinicians in the US, Europe and Asia have studied the effect of the lenses in 507 patients with presbyopia between the age of 40 and 60. They checked up on the patients over three years and found that in 83 per cent of them, the Kamra lenses gave them 20/40 vision or better. On average, patients gained 2.9 lines on a reading chart. Past attempts at implanting corneal inlays have given patients hazy vision, although this was treatable with steroids. But this more advanced procedure is reversible because the inlays can be removed. Dr John Vukich, a professor in ophthalmology and vision sciences at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, said: ‘Corneal inlays represent a great opportunity to improve vision with a safety net of removability.’ While the Kamra lens and procedure has not yet been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) it is on sale in Europe, Asia and South America. There are two other types of corneal inlays - Raindrop Near Vision Inlay and Presbia Flexivue Microlens, which are also in development for the US market. As well as the Kamra implant, there is a similar one called a 'Raindrop' that is also waiting for approval from the FDA. The Raindrop Near Vision Inlay is implanted underneath the cornea to correct vision. The technique was pioneered in America, but has made its way across the Atlantic and is now being used at Space Healthcare in Royal Leamington Spa, Warwickshire. It could replace laser surgery, which until now has been deemed the only long-term treatment, even though it leaves some recipients requiring reading glasses in dim light. The procedure takes around 10 minutes, compared to laser surgery which takes approximately one hour. Anaesthetic droplets are inserted into the patient's eye so they remain conscious throughout the procedure, as the implant is placed under a flap of the cornea. It corrects near medium vision by changing the shape of the cornea, with the central section becoming steeper. The procedure costs £2,495 and is not currently available on the NHS.","Kamra inlay, developed in the US, measures 3.8 millimetres in diameter and has a 1.6 millimetres hole in the centre .

"A Polish prosecutor shot himself today in dramatic footage caught on film in his office after cutting short a news conference. Moments earlier, he had defended a military investigation into leaks related to a plane crash that killed Poland's president two years ago. At the start of the conference at his office in Poznan, Colonel Mikolaj Przybyl said: 'During . my entire service as a civilian and later military prosecutor, I have never . brought shame to the Republic of Poland and I . will protect the honour of an officer of the Polish armed forces and . prosecution. 'Thank you, please give me a five-minute break, I need to . rest,' Przybyl said, as the reporters then leave the room. Scroll down for video . Polish prosecutor Mikolaj Przybyl at the start of the news conference in Poznan, western Poland . He defended a military investigation into leaks related to a plane crash that killed Poland's president two years ago . With the camera still rolling, he walks across the floor and, just out of shot, a pistol can be heard being reloaded and then a gunshot sounded. As he slumps to the ground, only his feet are in the frame. He was immediately taken to hospital after reporters found him lying in a pool of blood. Hospital director Leslaw Lenartowicz said Przybyl is in stable . condition, conscious, and his life is not in danger. He added that Przybyl had suffered . injuries to his face. Przybyl is a deputy head of the prosecutor's office and the head of a local department investigating organised . crime in the army. He then asked the reporters to leave as he 'needs a rest' With the camera still rolling, he crosses to the other side of his office after the journalists have left . After shooting himself, his body slumped to the floor, with just his shoe visible in the frame (arrowed) He had asked the reporters to leave his . office after he criticised media leaks from the continuing probe into . the plane crash in Russia on April 10, 2010, that killed then-president . Lech Kaczynski and 95 others, mostly senior Polish officials. During his brief news conference, . Przybyl said the military prosecutor's office had the right to seek . phone records of journalists covering the investigation of the . crash. He read a statement to reporters in which . he objected to plans by Prosecutor General Andrzej Seremet to put . military prosecutors under civilian authority. Seremet said that such a . decision has not been made yet. Przybyl also said that military . prosecutors were proving themselves competent in the many probes that . they have opened into organised crime cases inside the army. Przybyl was taken to hospital, where he is in a stable condition with injuries to his face . The death toll from the plane crash included the country's president and wife, its central bank head and the country's military chief along with other senior government and military figures . Dead: Polish President Lech Kaczynski and wife Maria were among those who perished in the crash . The probes . primarily concern suspicions of corruption in buying equipment for . Poland's troops on missions in Afghanistan and, earlier, in Iraq. Przybyl . denied media suggestions that the military prosecutors broke the law . while investigating the crash. The media have . alleged that the prosecutors had sought billing lists and text message . content of mobile phones of some reporters to determine the source of . leaks to the media. Several news outlets showed footage of Przybyl's body behind his desk before an ambulance took him to a hospital. A spokesman for the military prosecutor's office was not available for comment. 'According . to the information available, the prosecutor is alive, he is being treated in . the hospital and the site is being investigated by the prosecutors and military . police,' said spokesman of Poznan . military prosecutors office Slawomir Schewe. Polish . President Bronislaw Komorowski said in a statement he was 'concerned' about the suicide attempt and asked the head of the national security . bureau to monitor the situation. Some lawmakers are calling for a special parliamentary probe into the case. The wreckage of the Polish president's plane lies in woodland near Smolensk airport in Russia . Russia fully blamed Poland for the deadly plane crash which killed the Polish president. Russian . officials investigating the plane crash that killed Lech Kaczynski said the crew was pressured to land in bad weather by an . air force commander who had been drinking. Kaczynski and 95 . others, including his wife, died in April 2010 when their plane crashed . while trying to land in Smolensk, Russia. There were no survivors. Officials of the Interstate Aviation . Committee, which investigates crashes in much of the former Soviet . Union, said that the pilots were pressured to land by Poland's . air force commander, General Andrzej Blasik, who was in the cockpit. They said he had a blood-alcohol level of about 0.06 percent, enough to impair reasoning. Blasik's . presence in the cockpit 'had a psychological influence on the . commander's decision to take an unjustified risk by continuing the . descent with the predominant goal of landing against the odds,' the . committee chairwoman Tatiana Anodina told a news conference last January. The report found no fault with Russian air traffic controllers. Polish officials have already complained that previous . drafts of Russia's report should have questioned whether controllers . should have allowed the plane to land in poor visibility. In December 2010, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk accused the Russian investigators of negligence and mistakes. Kaczynski . and his delegation were on their way to attend a ceremony commemorating . the victims of the 1940 Katyn massacre, in which 20,000 Polish officers . and other prisoners of war were killed by the Soviet secret police. The symbolic importance of Kaczynski's planned visit apparently . increased the pressure to land the aircraft despite the poor conditions. But the head of the committee's technical commission, Alexei . Morozov, said there was no 'concrete command' from Kaczynski to land. The blood-alcohol content found in Blasik was lower than what is generally considered outright intoxication. But . the professional pilots and physicians group says 'the number of . serious errors committed by pilots dramatically increases at or above . concentrations of 0.04 percent,' lower than Blasik's level.","Mikolaj Przybyl had just defended military probe into leaks relating to plane crash that killed Poland's president .

It is not the first time Cowell has been hailed as a hero - in February he came to the rescue of a father-to-be by giving him a lift home in his private jet so he could get to see the birth of his first child. Cowell often holidays in the south of France and earlier this month he was spotted lapping up the French sunshine aboard a yacht. The music mogul was seen grinning at one point and perhaps it's because he could see his good friend David Walliams in the distance. The Little Britain star and his wife Lara Stone are also in St Tropez and were today spotted boarding Sir Elton John's yacht. Walliams later tweeted: 'I just mooned Simon Cowell. From a boat. That is true,' before adding: 'And then someone a million times more well known than me mooned Simon Cowell too' which means he could have been referring to the singer himself.",Drama was revealed by his ex-girlfriend Sinitta on Twitter .
"This is the incredible moment two people were pulled alive from a car that had been almost entirely flattened by a shipping container falling on top of it. Firefighters arriving at the scene in Qingdao in eastern China’s Shandong province were convinced that nobody could have survived the shocking accident, which occurred when a lorry overturned and shed its load. But they were amazed to discover that despite the vehicle being crushed into a barely recognisable shape, a woman could be heard calling for help from inside the twisted metal and giving the thumbs up through a tiny gap in the window to indicate both she and a male friend were somehow still alive. Incredible: A woman in a car crushed flat when a shipping container fell on top of it gives the thumbs up through a crack in the bodywork to indicate she is somehow still alive . Terrifying: Firefighters arriving at the scene in Qingdao in eastern China's Shandong province were convinced that nobody could have survived the shocking accident . Saved: Firefighters were amazed to discover that despite the vehicle being crushed into a barely recognisable shape, both passengers were alive. The woman was even able to be pulled out through a broken window . The accident happened on a road . in the city of Qingdao when a large lorry carrying the container toppled over, . shedding its load on to the car containing the two man and woman. Emergency services were sure that nobody could have survived the crash and that it was simply going to be a grisly case of recovering crushed bodies from within the wreck. But as they set about their task, they heard a woman calling for help from within the twisted metal. A stunning rescue operation involving a 100 tonne crane then got underway, and it was discovered the couple had only 60cm of space remaining inside their crushed car. Fire brigade spokesman Chi Tang said: . 'We had a call about the accident to say that a lorry had fallen onto a . car.' Miraculous: Incredibly the woman was easily pulled out the wreckage with little more than cuts and bruises. The man travelling with her (pictured left) was in a more serious condition and needed to be cut free . Dazed: Although the woman was not not badly injured she was taken to hospital to be treated for shock . 'We didn't expect anybody to be alive but then we heard a woman's . voice and realised that actually somebody had survived,' Mr Chi added. 'We had to bring in a 100 tonne crane to . make sure we lifted the container off carefully and we found the car . had been crushed so badly that was only 60cm of space left inside,' he went on to say. Incredibly the woman was easily pulled out the wreckage with little more than cuts and bruises, although she was subsequently taken to hospital to be treated for shock. The man travelling with her was in a more serious condition and needed to be cut free from the crushed vehicle, but he too is expected to make a full recovery. The driver of the lorry was also hospitalised with minor injuries. Rescue: Fire brigade spokesman Chi Tang said: 'We didn't expect anybody to be alive but then we heard a woman's voice and realised that actually somebody had survived' Accident: The lorry driver claimed that his vehicle shed its load after he swerved to avoid a third vehicle in front of him, which had slammed on its brakes . Treatment: All three of those involved in the crash were taken to hospital. Despite the incredible nature of the crash, all three are expected to make a full recovery . The lorry driver claimed that his vehicle shed its load after he swerved to avoid a third vehicle in front of him, which had slammed on its brakes. The driver said he turned too sharply to the right, tipping the vehicle over and throwing the shipping container on to the unfortunate car as it tried to overtake on his left. Fatal road accidents are a serious problem in China, where the highway network and number of new drivers are expanding rapidly while traffic laws and safety are widely flouted. The Chinese ministry of transport says the number of road deaths in the country fell from 104,000 in 2003 to 60,000 in 2012 - or from about 300 fatalities a day to less than 200. However, these figures are widely disputed, with many critics saying fatal accidents are around twice as high as official police statistics claim.","Car was almost entirely flattened when shipping container fell off lorry .

Witnesses said 25-year-old singer, who is still on parole following his recent release from jail, had been the target of shots fired at the 1OAK club in West Hollywood, where he was hosting a pre-party for tonight's Video Music Awards. Brown was thought to be unhurt, but three other victims - among them Death Row Records founder Marion 'Suge' Knight, 49, were reportedly taken to the city's Cedars Sinai hospital. Scroll down for video . Injured: Music producer Suge Knight (right) has been injured during a shooting at an awards show party at a Los Angeles nightclub hosted by singer Chris Brown (left) , it has been reported . Aftermath: Brown jumped on a table after the shooting, apparently furious at what had taken place . Chaos: Knight is treated by oparamedics after the frightening events at 1OAK in West Hollywood . Injured: Another victim is transferred into an ambulance in a stretcher . One of them was said to be in a critical condition. Model and actor Tyson Beckford, and Black Eyed Peas member Apple de Ap were inside the pre-VMA party hosted by Brown and told TMZ they had heard four shots being fired at around 1.30am today. Black Kapital Records CEO Knight was said to have walked out of the club, where he was spotted by a police officer and taken to hospital by ambulance. He was reportedly shot twice, injuring his stomach and arm, and is now undergoing surgery. The suspected gunmen were apprehended by police, as officers searched the nightspot for clues and quizzed revellers over the events of the night. Roads around the nightclub were immediately sealed off by police, as the nightclub was evacuated, with several partygoers detained for questioning. Angry: Brown at first appeared to still be furious when he made his way from the West Hollywood club . Leaving: Brown is seen walking to his Lamborghini after the drama at 1Oak in Los Angeles .

Guests at the event had also included singer Justin Bieber and rapper The Game. Katie Clendon, thought to have been inside the club, said via her Twitter account that she thought Brown had been the intended target. 'Literally can't believe what I just witnessed. Someone tried to fire shots at Chris Brown at 1oak. Speechless.' She added: 'Prayers to all those harmed by this. Honestly still in disbelief this happened.' In the moments after the shots were fired, Brown was seen climbing onto what appeared to be a bar in the nightclub, apparently angrily remonstrating with other clubgoers as a bouncer told partygoers to 'Get down'. At around 5:45 a.m. LA time, Brown tweeted about the incident. 'It's disappointing that we as a society can#t have fun or enjoy ourselves without any altercations sometimes.

'Me and @MOANNN sort refuge in a toilet cubicle as rifles targeted Chris brown & bieber outside. #usa, (sic)' Chloe wrote on her Twitter account, tagging Simone in the social media post. A controversial figure, Knight is no stranger to the effects of gun violence. His friend Tupac Shakur was shot multiple times during a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas in September 1996, although during a previous visit to 1OAK in May, Knight told reporters that no one had ever been charged with Shakur's murder because he wasn't really dead, and was instead living on an island. In the action: Australian model Simone Holtznagel said she hid in the bathroom during the drama . LA: The model referenced the differing gun laws in the USA and Australia, where firearms are banned . Knight also suffered a gunshot wound to the leg during a shooting at a 2005 pre-VMA party, hosted by rapper Kanye West. Owned by New York-based Butter Group, the Los Angeles branch of 1OAK  - which stands for One Of A Kind - is a spin off of the New York club, while there are further branches in Las Vegas and Mexico City. The club, which bills itself as 'Bringing a New York nightclub experience to Los Angeles' has been open on the famous Sunset Strip since the start of the year and has proved popular with many celebrities, including Leonardo DiCaprio and Rihanna. Last night's party at the club was a precursor to tonight's MTV Video Music Awards, which takes place from 6pm local time at LA's recently redeveloped Inglewood Forum.","Pre-VMAs party at 1OAK in West Hollywood hosted by singer Chris Brown .

As the pole fell, there were gasps of horror from the royal spectators, including the Duchess of Cambridge and Princes William and Harry. They knew Zara needed to put on a perfect show-jumping performance to take gold from the Germans. William and Kate were seen clapping their hands to their mouths in horror when the pole dropped to the floor, costing the team the crucial points.

"A secretive and highly organised group of medieval burglars carried specialist - and rather unusual - equipment to break in to houses, experts have revealed. The Banu Sasan – a group of rogues, vagabonds, wandering poets and outright criminals – broke and entered using a kit that included a crowbar, a . candle, stale bread, dried beans, an iron spike, a drill, a stick with . a cloth on the end of it, a bag of sand – and crucially, a tortoise. Opulent: The Banu Sasan, a group of burglars, poets  and rogues -  provided a contrast to the glories of Islam's golden age. Pictured is an illustration from the 1909 edition of the Persian classic 'Death of a Sultan' According to research carried out by the . British historian Professor Clifford Bosworth, Banu Sasan burglars . often worked by tunnelling into houses, Smithsonian.com reported. They used an iron spike or an iron hand with claws to break through a house wall. If they thought a door would be a better way of getting in they would use a crowbar instead. Once they had made a big enough hole to squeeze through, the thief would poke a . stick with a cloth on the end of it into the hole to prevent being attacked. The theory was that if someone had noticed a break-in from inside the house, they might attack with  whatever came though the opening with a sword or . hammer. The stick therefore prevented the thief sustaining an injury. A scene of daily life in 12th century Persia . Once the burglar knew it was safe to enter he employed his partner in crime: the tortoise. Professor Bosworth described his role, writing: ‘The tortoise is employed thus. The . burglar has with him a flint-stone and a candle about as big as a little . finger. He lights the candle and sticks it on the tortoise’s back. 'The . tortoise is then introduced through the breach into the house, and it . crawls slowly around, thereby illuminating the house and its contents.’ Once the tortoise had been set up, the burglar employed his bag of sand to check for sleeping inhabitants elsewhere in the house. He would throw out handfuls of sand at . intervals, and if no one stirred he entered the house. Professor Bosworth also said that the burglar might chew noisily on some . stale bread and beans to impersonate a cat eating a rat or . mouse so as not alarm any sleeping people in the house. Despite this knowledge, much about the Banu Sasan remains a . matter of conjecture. This is because knowledge of the Islamic . underworld comes from only a handful of sources. Most Arabic literature was produced by authors writing in cities and at courts for their patrons. It is not at all certain, for example, . how the Banu Sasan came by their name. The surviving sources mention two . incompatible explanations. The first is that Islamic criminals were . considered to be followers or 'sons' of Sheikh . Sasan, a Persian prince who was displaced from his rightful place as leader in the . succession and so took to living a wandering life. Medieval Persia was home to the Banu Sasan who broke and entered into homes using a kit that included a crowbar, a candle, stale bread, dried beans and crucially, a tortoise. They were widespread for six centuries . The second is that the name is a . corrupted version of 'Sasanid', the name of the old ruling dynasty of . Persia that the Arabs destroyed midway through the seventh century. Rule . by alien conquerors, the theory goes, reduced many Persians to the . level of outcasts and beggars, and forced them to live by their wits. There is no way now of knowing which of . these tales, if either, is true. It is known however that the Banu Sasan were widespread for six centuries and could be found everywhere from Spain to the Chinese border. Possessing their own tactics, tricks and slang, they provided a contrast to the glories of Islam’s golden age. When not breaking into houses they often posed as Muslim mystics or ascetics - well aware that the faithful Muslims could be persuaded to part with money  when a man claimed to be able to perform miracles.","Known as the Banu Sasan, the group of thieves used a highly specialised set of equipment to break into houses and steal people's possessions .
The tortoise would have a candle stuck to its shell and would be used to light a room and keep the burglar's hands free while he carried out his theft .

Amid reports that the Food Network has cancelled his own cooking show, Jamie posted this photo on Twitter on Friday of him smooching with Ineata 'Jellyroll' Jones . The woman in the photo, Ineata ‘Jellyroll’ Jones, is an employee of Paula Deen who was at the center of some of last year’s racist accusations. In 2013, The Columbus Dispatch claimed, ‘Deen used Jones for restaurant theater. At 11 a.m., when the doors opened at [her restaurant] Lady & Sons, she stood in front and rang an iron dinner bell.’ Jones was also tasked with making hoecakes at an open kitchen station in view of customers, and according to the paper, ‘Deen wanted Jones to dress in an old-style Aunt Jemima outfit.’ While Deen denied the accusation, former employee and Jones’ cousin Dora Charles said, ‘Jellyroll didn’t want to hear that. She didn’t want to do that.’ Deen was accused of forcing Ineata 'Jellyroll' Jones, pictured, to dress up in Aunt Jemima-style costume and postcards of her ringing the dinner bell were sold in many of the Deen Souvenir Shops . Jones did however dress up in Aunt Jemima-style costume and postcards of her ringing the dinner bell were sold in many of the Deen Souvenir Shops. She have never spoken out to criticize her boss, but others have taken offense at the ill-advised photo posted by Jamie Deen. One Twitter user, LaVerne Mack wrote, ‘Wow, did Paula Deen really call one of her workers Jelly Roll? I find that more offensive than the N word.’ 'Jelly Roll' is most perhaps most commonly associated with the jazz musician Jelly Roll Morton, although it is also slang for a black woman’s genitalia.

Paula announced on June 11 that she was returning to TV via a namesake streaming network that will launch later this year and feature her own show along with content featuring her son. She plans to charge viewers about $10 a month. ‘You can throw out your TV, now,’ gushed the fallen Food Network star.

I can't wait to crank up the oven and get cooking for the people I love: my family, my friends and my fans!’ The announcement of the digital network is the latest step in a comeback strategy Deen kicked off in February when she announced a deal with the Najafi Companies, an Arizona-based private investment firm that's putting millions into rebooting her public career. Earlier this month the 67-year-old gave a sneak peek of her upcoming 20-city comeback speaking tour with an appearance at the opening of her Gatlinburg, Tennessee retail Paula Deen Store.

"In an effort to reduce her bills from the Montecito Water District  - which have increasingly surged over the last three years as a record drought continues to cripple California -  Oprah Winfrey has reportedly been sending a fleet of water tankers to her 40-acre Santa Barbara property to maintain her gardens. The well-to-do residents of Montecito - the wealthiest suburb in Santa Barbara county - were warned in November that, without a 30 percent reduction in water at each home, the town would effectively run dry. But rather than let their manicured grounds desiccate, locals like Winfrey have found other ways to keep the grass green. Tankers carrying 5,000 gallons of water have been seen arriving at the gates of the former TV titan's $87 million palace, neighbors have told Politico. Scroll down for video . That's alot of lawn: Oprah Winfrey is reportedly trucking in water to maintain the gardens on her 42-acre property in the super-wealthy Santa Barbara town of Montecito . Up-keep: The tanker trucks, carrying 5,000 gallons, are a way to offset penalty costs for water overage, which are increasing in California as the drought continues . Expansive: Winfrey's palace, which she bought in 2001, features six bedrooms, 14 bathrooms, 10 fireplaces, a gourmet kitchen, theater, wine cellar, a barn, two ponds, tennis court, a 4,500 sq. ft. guest house with pool and a man-made lake . As a result, Winfrey's bill from the Montecito Water District is said to have been halved. Last year she paid $125,000 in water bills due to the amount it takes to look after her land. Trucking in water as you need it can cost up to $15,000 a month. California's water problem is still listed as a Stage 4 'exceptional drought'. Montecito itself is known as having little to no natural water source and is considered the dryer than any other part of California's central coast. Of the 13,500 residents in Montecito, 837of them were charged overage penalties in May. However general manager for the Montecito Water District, Tom Mosby, said Winfrey is actively working to lower her consumption and help out with the crisis. 'She is the poster child for us,' he told Politico. 'She's doing her part.' 'Poster girl': The Montecito Water District says that Winfrey is doing everything she can to adhere to the water restrictions and ongoing drought . Among Winfrey's neighbors are Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi, director George Lucas, actor Rob Lowe and actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus. The 60-year-old is currently renovating her 23,000 sq. ft. mansion. Built in 1959, WInfrey bought the home in 2001 from Southern California industrialist Robert Veloz and his wife, Marlene. It has six bedrooms, 14 bathrooms, 10 fireplaces, a  gourmet kitchen,theater, wine cellar, a barn, orchards, two ponds, an outdoor theater, tennis court, a 4,500 sq. ft. guest house with pool, an outdoor entertainment area and a man-made lake, according to Billionaire's Address. The expansive home was last valued by Zillow at $87,987,066.00. In 2012, Winfrey paid $904,239.00 in taxes.","California is now in its third year of a record drought .

Well this is my . last video, it all has to come to this. Tomorrow is the day of . retribution. The day in which I will have my revenge against humanity, . against all of you. For the last eight years of my life, ever since I’ve hit puberty, I’ve been forced to endure an existence of loneliness, rejection, and unfulfilled desires all because girls have never been attracted to me. Girls gave their affection and sex and love to other men but never to me. I’m 22 years old and I’m still a virgin I’ve never even kissed a girl. I’ve been through college for two and half years, more than that actually, and I’m still a virgin. It has been very torturous. College is the time when everyone experiences those things such as sex and fun and pleasure. In those years I’ve had to rot in loneliness. It’s not fair. You girls have never been attracted to me. I don’t know why you girls aren’t attracted to me but I will punish you all for it. It’s an injustice, a crime, because I don’t know what you don’t see in me. I’m the perfect guy and yet you throw yourselves at all these obnoxious men instead of me, the supreme gentleman. I will punish all of you for it. [Laughs] . Privileged: Rodger enjoyed a life of luxury, as this picture he took of himself in a first-class plane cabin shows . On the day of retribution, I am going to enter the hottest sorority house of UCSB [UC Santa Barbara]. And I will slaughter every single spoiled, stuck up blonde slut I see inside there. All those girls I have desired so much, they will have all rejected me and looked down upon me as an inferior man if I ever made a sexual advance towards them. While they throw themselves at these obnoxious brutes. I will take great pleasure in slaughtering all of you. You will finally see that I am, in truth, the superior one, the true alpha male. [Laughs] . Yes, after I have annihilated every single girl in the sorority house, I will take to the street of Isla Vista and slay every single person I see there. All those popular kids who live such lives of hedonist pleasure while I’ve had to rot in loneliness for all these years, they’ve all looked down upon me when I’ve tried to go out and join them. They’ve all treated me like a mouse. Well now I will be a god compared to you. You will all be animals. You are animals and I will slaughter you like animals and I will be a god, exacting my retribution on all those who deserve it. And you do deserve it, just for the crime of living a better life than me. All you popular kids, you’ve never accepted me. Now you’ll all pay for it. 'Alpha male': Rodger poses in his BMW wearing shades on his Facebook pages . Video Source YouTube . Girls, all I’ve ever wanted is to love you and be loved by you. I’ve wanted a girlfriend, I’ve wanted sex, I’ve wanted love, affection, adoration. But you think I’m unworthy of it. That’s a crime that can never be forgiven. If I can’t have you girls, I will destroy you. [Laughs] You denied me a happy life and in turn I will deny all of you life. [Laughs] It’s only fair. I hate all of you. Humanity is a disgusting, wretched, depraved species. If I had it in my power, I would stop at nothing to reduce every single one of you to mountains of skulls and rivers of blood. And rightfully so. You deserve to be annihilated and I’ll give that to you. You never showed me any mercy and so I will show you none. [Laughs] You forced me to suffer all my life and now I’ll make you all suffer. I’ve waited a long time for this. I’ll give you exactly what you deserve, all of you, all you girls, who rejected me and looked down upon me and, you know, treated me like scum while you gave yourselves to  other men. And all of you men for living a better life than me, all of you sexually active men, I hate you, I hate all of you. I can’t wait to give you exactly what you deserve. Utter annihilation. [Laughs] . [In another video taken near a golf course and posted on YouTube the same day, the killer revealed his jealousy at young lovers.] . This world is so marvellous, full of beautiful places like this and yet, all I can do is just sit by myself and admire them. Every time I go out, I always have to see these young couples and I get jealous of them. They remind me of exactly what I’m missing out in life. Sex, love, companionship. I’m sexually attracted to girls but girls are not sexually attracted to me. There’s a major problem with that, major problem. That’s a problem I intend to rectify. [Laughs] I, in all my magnificence and power, I will not let this fly, it’s an injustice that needs to be dealt with.","Killer Elliot Rodger filmed himself delivering a hate-filled manifesto .

"Activist hackers linked to the collective known as Anonymous have secretly accessed U.S. government computers in multiple agencies and stolen sensitive information in a campaign that began almost a year ago, the FBI warned this week. The hackers exploited a flaw in Adobe Systems Inc's software to launch a rash of electronic break-ins that began last December, then left 'back doors' to return to many of the machines as recently as last month, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said in a memo seen by Reuters. The memo, distributed on Thursday, described the attacks as 'a widespread problem that should be addressed.' It said the breach affected the U.S. Army, Department of Energy, Department of Health and Human Services, and perhaps many more agencies. U.S. government officials are 'very concerned' about the amount of personal information the hackers obtained . Investigators are still gathering information on the scope of the cyber campaign, which the authorities believe is continuing. The FBI document tells system administrators what to look for to determine if their systems are compromised. An FBI spokeswoman declined to elaborate. According to an internal email from Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz' chief of staff, Kevin Knobloch, the stolen data included personal information on at least 104,000 employees, contractors, family members and others associated with the Department of Energy, along with information on almost 2,0000 bank accounts. Lauri Love (left) took an advantage of a security flaw in Adobe ColdFusion software which is used to build sites . The email, dated October 11, said officials were 'very concerned' that loss of the banking information could lead to thieving attempts. Officials said the hacking was linked to the case of Lauri Love, a British resident indicted on October 28 for allegedly hacking into computers at the Department of Energy, Army, Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Sentencing Commission and elsewhere. Investigators believe the attacks began when Love and others took advantage of a security flaw in Adobe's ColdFusion software, which is used to build websites. Adobe spokeswoman Heather Edell said she was not familiar with the FBI report. She added that the company has found that the majority of attacks involving its software have exploited programs that were not updated with the latest security patches. Hacker Aron Swartz (left) killed himself shortly before he had to go to trial for illegally downloading academic journals from the website Jstor . The Anonymous group is an amorphous collective that conducts multiple hacking campaigns at any time, some with a few participants and some with hundreds. In the past, its members have disrupted eBay's Inc PayPal after it stopped processing donations to the anti-secrecy site Wikileaks. Anonymous has also launched technically more sophisticated attacks against Sony Corp and security firm HBGary Federal. Some of the breaches and pilfered data in the latest campaign had previously been publicized by people who identify with Anonymous, as part of what the group dubbed 'Operation Last Resort.' Among other things, the campaigners said the operation was in retaliation for overzealous prosecution of hackers, including the lengthy penalties sought for Aaron Swartz, a well-known computer programmer and Internet activist who killed himself before a trial over charges that he illegally downloaded academic journal articles from a digital library known as JSTOR. Despite the earlier disclosures, 'the majority of the intrusions have not yet been made publicly known,"" the FBI wrote. 'It is unknown exactly how many systems have been compromised, but it is a widespread problem that should be addressed.' After PayPal stopped processing donations to Wikileaks, the 'Anonymous' collective infiltrated the site .","The hacking is a response to the recent persecution of computer hackers Lauri Love and Aron Swartz .

The 90-year-old Just A Minute host said: 'It is very nice to be honoured for all the things you do because you enjoy and love them.' He said the Queen had told him his hard work was 'greatly admired'. He added: 'If you get something out of the work you are doing, it seems only right that you put something back into society, because if you have achieved some recognition for your achievements, what a pleasure to have that opportunity to put something back in and help others less fortunate.' A British soldier who lost both his legs to a Taliban bomb blast walked unaided on 'bionic legs' to receive his MBE from the Queen today. Rifleman Michael Swain, 24, had both his legs amputated above the knee following the explosion in Afghanistan in November 2009. He has since undergone revolutionary surgery in Australia.

Rifleman Swain has a son, Max, three, with partner Jade Hardiman, 24, who is also expecting the couple's second child, a girl. They live in Luton, Bedfordshire. Miss Hardiman, who was at the castle today, said: 'Now he is up on his legs it is the best he has been, it is so overwhelming. 'He has been an amazing dad, he had been in a wheelchair for three years while Max was little and he managed to do it.'

"Theft: Mark Cos has allegedly stolen underwear from Emma Pinches home . A police officer's son with an underwear fetish broke into a woman's house to steal her knickers, a court heard. Mark Cox, 22, pocketed a set of house keys belonging to former school pal Emma Pinches, 21, after going to a party at her home in February. The hospital porter then used the keys to let himself in to the property while Emma was out - to steal her underwear. Magistrates heard she became suspicious when items of lingerie started to go missing over the next few weeks. Prosecuting Julie Costello said: 'The day after the party the victim noticed a set of house keys were missing. 'Over the next few days she started to notice that items of her underwear were going missing.' Emma suspected Cox may be responsible when she received a text from him in March to ask whether she would be out with her boyfriend that evening. Police then searched Cox's home and found a large quantity of women's underwear. When asked why he had a large sized bra he told them it was because he was a 'large size' Officers also discovered CS gas spray as well as a police helmet, handcuffs, jacket and stab vest in his bedroom. Cox claimed he had bought the police uniform items off eBay to use for kinky role-playing sex romps with his ex-girlfriend. Victim: Emma Pinches was a former school friend of mark and had her underwear stolen . Suspicious: Emma thought Mark might be responsible when she received a text from him asking her if she would be going out with her boyfriend that night . At Northampton Magistrates Court Cox pleaded guilty to two counts of burglary, one count of possessing a weapon designed for the discharge of CS gas and possessing a police uniform. Defending Alistair Evans revealed his client had taken the items at a time when he was being 'driven by a fetish' for women's underwear. He said his client had bought the police uniform as 'memorabilia' because his father and grandfather were both police officers. Underwear: Defence said that the actions were driven by a fetish but that he had not vandalised the property . He added: 'He accepts he had taken the items of underwear from the victim's house but there was no element of vandalism and he had caused no form of damage to the woman's house. 'The CS spray was bought from a garage in France. 'It has never been used.' The court was told Cox has since undergone counselling in a bid to overcome his underwear addiction. He will be sentenced at Northampton Crown Court next month.","Mark Cox, 22, stole his friends house keys and broke into her flat .

"New polling numbers paint a dismal picture of the Obama presidency as the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) gains influence in the Middle East and threatens to mount an attack on the U.S. homeland. Just 42 per cent of Americans now see the president as a 'strong leader,' according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll released Tuesday - despite bullish talk from the White House that Obama will be able to carry out his strategy against ISIS without asking Congress. Even as the U.S. leader languished in the new poll - consistent with seven others asking Americans to rate the president's performance. Tanking: President Obama's rating as a 'strong leader' is at an all-time low atas he prepares to outline a strategy to defeat the ISIS terror network before it can mount an attack on America . Nearly two-thirds – 65 per cent – say the U.S. should ramp up airstrikes against ISIS and expand them into Syria, where the terror group has its largest strongholds and have so far been protected by a largely invisible national border. And 70 per cent think ISIS is already positioned inside the United States with the resources and ability to mount an attack. The development came as Obama prepared to deliver a prime-time address on Wednesday outlining  his plans for an expanded military and political effort to combat militants in Syria and Iraq. Obama is expected to urge Congress to quickly give him authority to arm moderate Syrian opposition forces fighting President Bashar Assad. But, though he will ask, administration officials say Obama will press forward with other elements of his plan even without Congressional say-so. That could include further airstrikes against the Islamic State militants in Iraq and possibly in Syria. Other elements of Obama's plan include increased support for Iraqi security forces, as well as military and diplomatic commitments from partners in Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere. A whopping 54 per cent now say they disapprove of Obama's work in the Oval Office, according to the average published by Real Clear Politics. Slightly more, 55 per cent, told ABC pollsters that Obama is not a strong leader. RCP's presidential approval average peaked at 65.5 per cent approval shortly after Obama's first inauguration in 2009, and stood at 54 per cent after his second election – the same number who now say they disapprove. His current 42 per cent rating has been worse – notably after the disastrous launch of Healthcare.gov – but Americans have never had a lower estimation of the president's leadership strength. A separate poll released Monday by CNN and ORC International found that 71 percent of Americans think ISIS terrorists are already positioned in the United States with the resources they need to mount an attack. About 87 per cent said they were concerned about the threat ISIS poses to America's national security. Obama is set to deliver a critical speech Wednesday night at 9:00 p.m. Eastern time, in which he's expected to outline a comprehensive strategy to 'degrade and destroy' the Islamist group. Observers in both Congress and the White House expect that any effective plan will stretch well into the next presidency. House Speaker John Boehner and other congressional leaders will meet with the president Tuesday at 5:00 p.m. to hear a preview of the speech. 'What I’m hoping to hear from the president today is a strategy that goes after ISIS, and destroys them,' Boehner said in a statement. 'I’ve been calling for a strategy to deal with the growing terrorist threat since January, when ISIS came across the border in western Iraq. We have a very serious problem, and what we need is a strategy. ... I am looking for a strategy from the president that takes on this terrorist threat and defeats it.' The president has been criticized for emphasizing political solutions – encouraging Iraq to build an 'inclusive' government that no longer marginalizes religious minority groups – instead of being more aggressive militarily. Middle East or Arizona Desert? A strong majority of Americans think ISIS is already positioned in the US for attacks to be mounted later . The Department of Defense reported on Monday that U.S. Central Command has presided over 148 airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq. But a Pentagon insider told MailOnline that more than 500 targets have been hit. Still, ISIS poses a continuing threat because it could retreat into Syria, and maintains its largest strongholds in the eastern part of that country. Obama is said to be weighing options to attack there, despite objections from Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. The Pentagon has already conducted numerous flyovers with surveillance drones to assess ISIS's capabilities and identify potential airstrike targets. Sen. Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican, said Tuesday that 'as we wait for the president to outline his long overdue strategy, ISIS is a growing danger to our national security, to our allies, and to innocent people across the Middle East.' Any strategy Obama articulates is likely to lean heavily on the involvement of a coalition of nations, rather than engaging ISIS alone. The CNN/ORC poll found that 61 per cent of Americans oppose sending American ground troops into Iraq to fight ISIS. But 6 in 10 also said they would support new military action if other countries shared the burden.","Just 42 per cent said Obama is a strong leader in damning new poll .
