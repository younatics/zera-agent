"The mother of James Foley -- an American journalist beheaded by ISIS militants -- said she is ""embarrassed and appalled"" by how the U.S. government dealt with her son's case, telling CNN that officials even suggested family members could be charged if they raised ransom to free him. ""I think our efforts to get Jim freed were an annoyance"" to the U.S. government, Diane Foley told CNN's Anderson Cooper in an interview that aired Thursday. ""It didn't seem to be in (U.S.) strategic interest, if you will."" Officials told Foley family members ""not go to the media,"" and that the ""government would not exchange prisoners,""  or carry out ""military action"" to try to rescue her son, according to Diane Foley. ""Jim was killed in the most horrific way. He was sacrificed because of just a lack of coordination, lack of communication, lack of prioritization,"" Diane Foley said. ""As a family, we had to find our way through this on our own."" She added that the family was told many times that raising ransom ""was illegal (and) we might be prosecuted."" ""We were just told to trust that he would be freed somehow, miraculously,"" Foley's mother told CNN. ""And he wasn't, was he?"" In fact, video posted online on August 19 showed James Foley kneeling next to a man dressed in black, with Foley reading a presumably scripted message that his ""real killer"" is America, then being summarily executed. ISIS -- the Islamist extremist group that's taken over large swaths of Syria and Iraq in its quest to create a far-reaching caliphate under its strict version of Sharia law -- took credit for Foley's beheading, saying it was in response to U.S. airstrikes in Iraq and threatening more killings. 'Our government needs to be ... willing to negotiate' More than three weeks later, U.S. President Barack Obama named Foley as he outlined his strategy for fighting ISIS and described the terrorist group's brutality. ""They enslave, rape, and force women into marriage. They threatened a religious minority with genocide. In acts of barbarism, they took the lives of two American journalists -- Jim Foley and Steven Sotloff,"" Obama said in a televised address Wednesday night. As she watched the speech, Diane Foley said one thing was going through her mind. ""This whole strategy to eliminate ISIS and the terror threat is important, obviously, so perhaps part of the strategic way of doing that is to bomb them, and to engage in force. But that only caused Jim's death,"" she said. ""I guess all I'm trying to say is that our government needs to be shrewder, smarter, willing to negotiate with these people who hate us, so that we can find better ways to rid ourselves of terror."" Video shows ISIS beheading James Foley . 'He was compelled to bear witness' After her son's death, Diane Foley wrote on the Free James Foley Facebook page that ""we have never been prouder of our son Jim. He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people."" Sometimes, she said Thursday, it was tough for his family to deal with his decisions to report in dangerous parts of the world. ""At times, even his siblings were angered that he would return after his captivity in Libya. I mean, it was hard as a family to understand, because Jim was so loved ... and we were selfish. We wanted him with us. We wanted him safe,"" she said. ""But Jim was not. Jim was selfless, and he had the courage and the compassion. ... He was compelled to bear witness."" To this end, his family launched  a foundation -- the James W. Foley Legacy Fund -- aimed at helping families of American hostages, supporting U.S. journalists in war zones and helping urban youth in educational endeavors. The organization is one way the Foley family is trying to honor James' past and do something positive in the future. But none of it takes away Diane Foley's disappointment that more wasn't done -- especially by the U.S. government -- to secure his release, somehow, since his November 22, 2012, disappearance in northwest Syria. At the time he was working for U.S.-based online news outlet GlobalPost. ""Jim would have been saddened"" by the U.S. government's efforts in the years after his abduction, his mother told CNN. ""Jim believed, till the end, that his country would come to (his) aid."" A failed rescue operation . Upon hearing these comments, U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice -- after praising the Foley family for doing ""an amazing job ... to try to bring Jim home safely"" -- said she ""and others in the U.S. government worked very hard with Diane Foley and her family to try to be supportive, to try to provide what information we could."" Rice also pointed out ""hundreds of American personnel"" were involved in a ""very daring and very well-executed rescue operation"" to free Foley and other captives, after getting what they hoped was ""actionable intelligence"" about the location of the hostages. Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby has said elite U.S. commandos undertook this mission this summer inside Syria. Official: U.S. commandos tried, failed to rescue hostages . ""Unfortunately, they were no longer there,"" Rice, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told CNN. ""But I think that effort ... underscores the importance that we attach to doing everything that we possibly can to bring Americans in captivity back home."" Diane Foley, though, said the rescue operation came ""very late."" ""Their location was known for more than a year,"" she said. During her son's time in captivity, she said, it often seemed the family knew more about his whereabouts than the authorities. ""I did all I could,"" she said. ""I was unable to do enough."" Lessons for the future . Now, Diane Foley says she thinks Washington should change its approach to cases like that of her son and Steven Sotloff, another American journalist beheaded by ISIS weeks after James Foley. ""I pray that our government will be willing to learn from the mistakes that were made,"" she told CNN, ""and to acknowledge that there are better ways for American citizens to be treated."" There should be international dialogue about how to handle hostages of terrorist groups, she said. ""The risk is becoming higher and higher,"" she said, ""and I really feel that our country let Jim down.""

"It was the government's fault, contractors on the problem-plagued website for President Barack Obama's signature health care reforms told a congressional hearing on Thursday. In more than four hours of testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, officials of companies hired to create the HealthCare.gov website cited a lack of testing on the full system and last-minute changes by the federal agency overseeing the online enrollment system. Angry exchanges between Republicans who oppose Obamacare and Democrats defending it erupted repeatedly, while the contractors insisted their work went fine even though the software buckled when the system went online on October 1. Complaints about logging in, lengthy delays, incorrect information relayed to insurance companies and other problems have fueled continued GOP attacks on the 2010 Affordable Care Act that was upheld by the Supreme Court last year. The White House and administration officials say the enrollment problems are being fixed. On Thursday, the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) that oversees the new programs under the health care reforms said almost 700,000 applications have been submitted online on either the federal or state websites. While the applications don't mean that many people have fully enrolled for health insurance under the new system, the figure represents a significant increase in those who have been able to start the process in recent days. However, Julie Bataille, the CMS director of communications, was unable to say how many of the 700,000 applications were submitted on the federal website. Bataille seemed to agree with some of the criticism by contractors at the hearing, saying that ""due to a compressed time frame, the system just wasn't tested enough, especially for high volume."" House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa on Thursday raised the threat of a possible subpoena if Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius doesn't respond to his panel's questions and requests for documents about problems with the Obamacare website. Committee aides say Sebelius has failed to respond to a previous request and Issa is now giving her until Monday to comply or possibly face ""compulsory"" action. At Thursday's hearing, committee Chairman Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan called the launch of the website ""nothing short of a disaster,"" noting that contractors at the hearing previously ""looked us in the eye and assured us repeatedly that everything was on track, except that it wasn't."" Upton and other Republicans said it heralded problems with the rest of the Obamacare reforms. ""I am more nervous today than I was when I got here,"" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers of Michigan said of security concerns raised by Thursday's testimony, such as code changes being made to fix the problems without undergoing normal testing. Democrats, however, accused Republicans of continuing a campaign to sabotage the health care reforms instead of working to fix problems in the system intended to help millions of uninsured Americans obtain affordable health coverage. They noted that media headlines in 2006 blared similar descriptions of rollout problems with the Medicare Part D prescription drug reforms of the Bush administration, but that Democrats then worked with Republicans to resolve the issues instead of trying to scrap the legislation. ""The Republicans don't have clean hands coming here. Their effort is not to make things better,"" said Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey. ""Let the goal here be to fix it, not nix it."" In the first detailed account of what happened, officials of four contractors involved in the website creation described a convoluted system of multiple companies operating separately under the oversight of CMS, a part of the Department of Health and Human Services. Each said their individual components generally performed as planned after internal testing, but all conceded that CMS failed to conduct sufficient ""end-to-end"" testing of the entire system before the launch. ""The system didn't receive adequate end-to-end testing,"" declared Andrew Slavitt of Optum, while Cheryl Campbell of CGI Federal added ""no one ever gets enough time for testing."" Campbell, whose company has a contract worth a possible total of more than $200 million for its work on the system, noted than an end-to-end test conducted within two weeks of the launch caused the system to crash. She said it was up to CMS to decide on proceeding with the rollout. Slavitt, whose company stands to make up to $85 million for its work, acknowledged that unexpected volume at the start overwhelmed the ""enterprise identity management"" or EIDM entry portal blamed for the initial blockages. He and Campbell blamed a decision by CMS within two weeks of the launch to require users to fully register in order to browse for health insurance products, instead of being able to get information anonymously, as originally planned. While the technical change to require registration was easy, the result was a much greater burden on the system that it failed to handle, Slavitt and Campbell said. Insurers pledge to help solve website problems . Bataille of CMS called the change a business decision to ensure that users could fully enroll from the start. She blamed the initial problems of the website on ""pent up consumer demand."" However, Slavitt of Optum said CMS was warned about the system's problems ahead of the launch. That was enough for GOP Rep. Renee Ellmers of North Carolina to say: ""The bottom line here is that CMS is responsible for this failure."" At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney told reporters on Thursday that administration officials ""did not anticipate, we did not know of the kind of problems that would take place beginning on October 1 until October 1 came and we saw these challenges."" He repeated the President's insistence that the problems were being fixed, an assurance also provided by Bataille. ""We increased our bandwidth by adding servers and improving site architecture. We're continuing this work,"" she said. ""Problems wtih our database and system synchronization also made it hard for visitors to initially create accounts. So we improved site architecture, substituted in hardware and optimized database inquiries."" White House video makes HealthCare.gov issues seem simple . Sebelius offered a similar view while addressing reporters in Arizona, acknowledging continued issues while insisting ""fixes"" are being instituted regularly to make things better. ""It's better today than it was on October 1, but it's a long way from perfect,"" Sebelius said after visiting one of 17 call centers where some 10,000 representatives talk by phone or online with those asking about health plans. ""And we are determined to make it perfect."" At the committee hearing, Campbell of CGI Federal said ""the system is working, people are enrolling, but people will be able to enroll at a faster pace"" as troubles get resolved. Her company expects the online system to be able to enroll Americans seeking health insurance by January 1, she added, rejecting media reports that software needs to be scrapped or that five million lines of code must be rewritten. Campbell called the software program unprecedented, noting that ""for the first time in history"" it combines the process of enrolling and selecting health insurance with determining eligibility for government subsidies ""all in one place."" Sebelius on the spot in Obamacare website fiasco . To accentuate progress on the website, two Democratic panel members said during the hearing that either they or their offices were able to use the website to determine health insurance options available to them on Wednesday or Thursday. However, Republicans said they had failed to gain full access to the website despite repeated attempts and complained they hear similar stories from their constituents across the country. Gupta: 5 surprises from Sebelius interview . The Energy and Commerce Committee isn't the only one probing Obamacare in light of its issues. So, too, is the House Ways and Means Committee and the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The latter sent an eight-page letter Wednesday to 11 contracting firms involved in putting together HealthCare.gov giving them two days to provide documents, meeting lists and all communications with the Obama administration on the project, committee spokeswoman Caitlin Carroll said. Meanwhile, Republican Sens. Orrin Hatch of Utah and Chuck Grassley of Iowa sent a letter to 47 contractors on Thursday also seeking extensive details of their work on the Obamacare website including all contracts and other information. Congressional Republicans have sought to undermine the health care reforms, trying unsuccessfully to make defunding or delaying them a requirement for legislation to fund the government. Sebelius: Website problems blindsided President . The White House has pushed back against Republicans and some Democrats who have urged an extension of the open enrollment period beyond March 31 and/or a delay in penalties for those who don't sign up for insurance on time because of the website issues. The Obama administration is moving to clarify confusion on when people need to sign up for health care, and it has plans to issue new guidelines to this point soon. Still, Health and Human Services spokeswoman Joanne Peters insisted ""the individual mandate timing"" -- i.e. the requirement for a person to have insurance by March -- ""has not changed. ...

"(CNN)Chocolate is on the menu and unity is the message as Republicans head to Hershey, Pennsylvania, for the first joint GOP House and Senate retreat in 10 years. But as House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell lay the groundwork for their agenda on Capitol Hill this year, tension from conservatives unhappy that their leaders aren't being bold enough could make things awkward. Comedian Jay Leno is slated to warm up the group on Wednesday night. But even before boarding buses to Pennsylvania, some Republicans clearly weren't ready to sing kumbaya. ""I think the leadership is unified - unified in doing very little,"" conservative Rep. Tim Huelskamp told CNN. The Kansas Republican told CNN it was time to plot a way forward to repeal Obamacare and roll back the president's actions on immigration -- not focus on finding compromises with President Barack Obama. ""They want to all get along with the President, which is not the election results,"" Huelskamp said about GOP leaders, adding, ""that's misreading exactly the opposite of what November 2014 is about."" Huelskamp was one of the 25 House Republicans who tried to deny Boehner his third term as Speaker, opposing him on a vote earlier this month. This vocal group is demanding that Boehner and McConnell go big and schedule votes on a variety of proposals to highlight a contrast with the President and congressional Democrats, even if those things don't have the chance of becoming law. Other House Republicans are fed up that this small bloc of conservatives has been able to force the debate to tack to the right, and start off the New Year with a focus on the divisions inside the party on hot button issues like immigration. ""At some point our far right has got to understand that us 'regular conservatives' are not necessarily on board with what they want to do,"" Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger told CNN.  He noted, ""our caucus has got to understand that sometimes the noisiest 25 in the caucus is not a majority."" In another potential headache for GOP leaders, a new group of House conservatives is setting up a formal structure to meet regularly and develop policy proposals. These members don't believe the current group that already does this - known as the Republican Study Committee (RSC) -  is sufficiently independent of the leadership. The current RSC Chair, Texas Rep. Bill Flores, told CNN his group was already influencing the agenda in the House. ""Look at what we've had on the floor- that's nothing but a conservative agenda,"" he said. The splits that have emerged in public are sure to be highlighted in closed door meetings in Hershey.  Organizers have planned breakout sessions on immigration, health care and the budget process. Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, columnist Peggy Noonan, and author Walter Isaacson are also slated to address the group. But Kinzinger warned ""our flanks in the party have got to understand that when you work as a team and accomplish 70%m it's way better than what we had last week,"" referring to the contentious debate over immigration. Republican leaders started out the year putting a priority on items conservatives wanted to tackle.  The House voted on bills approving the Keystone pipeline, repealing a key provision of Obamacare, and reversing some of the Wall Street reforms the President pushed for in 2010. Right before members left for the retreat, the House approved a funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security that also attached a series of amendments nullifying the President's most recent executive action on immigration. GOP leaders also allowed a vote on a measure that went even further -- it eliminated a program that deferred deportations for so-called ""Dreamers"" - children of those who entered the U.S. illegally. While the bill passed, a group of 26 House Republicans opposed that amendment dealing with deportations on young people, with many saying that proposal went too far. The President had already threatened vetoes on the bulk of the GOP bills the House was passing. But at a meeting with bipartisan congressional leaders with President Obama on Wednesday there was a lot of talk about trying to focus on the things where both sides could agree. Republican aides are setting low expectations for the retreat - saying this is the beginning of discussions on the way forward on key priorities like getting rid of Obamacare, drafting major tax reform legislation, pushing jobs bills, and cutting federal spending. ""It's important that we get together, open up lines of communication and unify around some goals that we have for the upcoming Congress,"" House GOP Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rogers told CNN. One controversial decision leaders are still grappling with is whether or not to use a procedure known as ""budget reconciliation"" to try to repeal Obamacare. If they decide to use this process - one that is available for items that impact the debt and the deficit - Senate leaders would just need a simple majority to pass legislation, which gets around a likely Democratic-led filibuster on Obamacare. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a tea-party favorite, in a speech before Heritage Foundation this week, said Congress should use ""every procedural tool available including reconciliation to repeal Obamacare with 51 votes in the Senate."" But other congressional Republicans argue it should be reserved for something the President could sign - like tax reform or a bill boosting infrastructure across the country. Huelskamp said if leaders decided to use that process to do tax reform instead of repealing Obamacare that would be ""a very stupid Republican decision - we're going to help corporations and let the rest of these guys suffer?"" One potential complication for McConnell is maneuvering his plans while three Senate Republicans  - Cruz, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, and Kentucky Senator Rand Paul - are preparing possible presidential campaigns for 2016. But Rubio and Paul are skipping the retreat.","House and Senate Republicans will meet jointly for the first time in a decade .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- The bodies of the nine suspected Pakistani terrorists -- all believed to have been involved in the attacks on Mumbai -- are still lying in a hospital morgue almost five months after the attacks occurred. Security is tight for the trial of the only surviving alleged Mumbai terrorist. The public prosecutor trying the lone surviving suspected gunman in the Mumbai attacks told CNN the dead suspects have not been buried because no one has come to claim them and local Muslim officials are refusing to bury the men in Mumbai's Muslim graveyards. Public prosecutor Ujwal Nikam said he will soon be in discussions with officials to decide what should happen with the bodies. The burial issue has stoked controversy. Groups such as the Indian Muslim Council don't want the people buried in Muslim cemeteries because they have defamed the religion. Other Muslims have disagreed, saying burial should be available for any Muslim. John O. Voll -- professor of Islamic history and associate director of the Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding at Georgetown University in Washington -- said the Abrahamic religious traditions, including Judaism, Christianity and Islam, have very often set restrictions on grounds they have sanctified for burials. One stricture, for example, has been prohibiting burial of a person from another faith. ""The non-burial"" of the suspected terrorists ""is making the statement that they are acting so contrary to Islam they are not acting as Muslims and therefore they are judged as being unbelievers and not worthy of being buried in a Muslim cemetery,"" Voll said. India, which has a population of over 1.1 billion people, is 81 percent Hindu, 13 percent Muslim, and 2 percent Christian, according to data from the World Almanac. One surprising aspect about the burial issue, Voll said, is that the Indian Muslim community is usually not very proactive publicly and tries to avoid publicity. ""In this particular case, it's very important for the Indian Muslim community to make it clear that they have nothing to do with the people who claim to be Muslims who engaged in terrorism in Mumbai,"" Voll said. Nikam is prosecuting a case against Mohammed Ajmal Kasab the 10th suspected Pakistani terrorist. Police say the 10 men gunned down more than 160 people in the November attack on Mumbai, India's financial capital. The attack went on for four nights and three days including the siege of three luxury hotels and a Jewish center. Police say Kasab is the only suspected gunman caught alive. The alleged actions of the nine suspects who were killed in the attacks will likely play a role as the prosecution builds its case against Kasab. After months of delays due to security concerns and difficulty finding an attorney to defend Kasab, his trial finally got under way Friday. Kasab is being charged with 12 criminal counts including murder, attempted murder and waging war against India. Police say he was caught on a surveillance camera holding a gun as he stalked and killed people inside Mumbai's main train station, formerly known as Victoria Terminus. Kasab is also accused of shooting people at Mumbai's Cama hospital. Kasab's newly court-appointed defense attorney, Abbas Kazmi, argued that Kasab was under age and should be tried in Juvenile Court, but Judge M.L. Tahilyani disagreed saying Kasab was more than 20 years old and could not be considered a juvenile. In his opening statements Nikam read from Kasab's alleged confession on how he trained for the attacks. The terror attack was in order to capture Kashmir, Nikam said. The Kashmir territory has long been a source of tension between India and Pakistan. Kazmi said Kasab is now retracting his statements because Kasab says he confessed under police pressure. The court hearing is continuing. From CNN's New Delhi bureau and Joe Sterling in Atlanta .","Indian Muslim organization do not want to bury alleged Mumbai terrorists .

"The sleeping giant has awoken: Latinos not only helped Obama win in key battleground states, but they made up 10% of the electorate for the first time ever. Latinos, the fastest growing minority, making up 16% of the nation's population, made their mark on election night as they voted for President Barack Obama over Republican Mitt Romney 71% to 27%, a lower percentage than Republican candidates have received in in the last three elections. At 27% this year, Romney's Latino support is dramatically lower than former President George W. Bush's support in 2004, which was 44%, and Arizona Sen. John McCain's 31% in 2008, according to exit polls. The lowest percentage of Latino voters won by a Republican was in 1996, when Bob Dole garnered only 21% of Latinos compared with then-President Bill Clinton's record 72%. In 2008, Obama received 67% of the Latino vote. Latinos made up 9% of the electorate in 2008 with 19.5 million people eligible to vote. Today, there are nearly 24 million Hispanics eligible to vote. The number of registered Latinos has increased by 26% in the last four years to 12.2 million, according a  report by the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials. ""It's something we saw coming and have seen happen for a numbers of years now. Hispanics are increasing their share of their electorate,"" said Mark Hugo Lopez, associate director of the Pew Hispanic Center. ""That number has been growing for a number of election cycles, and it's going to continue to grow moving forward."" What might have swayed Latinos to vote for Obama more than anything else? Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida says the GOP was never able to connect with them. ""The conservative movement should have particular appeal to people in minority and immigrant communities who are trying to make it, and Republicans need to work harder than ever to communicate our beliefs to them,"" Rubio said in a statement on Election Day. Democratic political strategist and commentator for The New Yorker Richard Socarides said on CNN's Early Start, ""You can have engagement, but if you have no solutions on immigration, people who are concerned about those issues are not going to support you."" Outreach and the message to the Latino community will be vital. In an originally off-the-record interview with the Des Moines Register in October, the president was ""confident about immigration reform in the second term."" ""And since this is off the record, I will just be very blunt,"" Obama said in a transcript of the interview posted by the paper. ""Should I win a second term, a big reason I will win a second term is because the Republican nominee and the Republican Party have so alienated the fastest-growing demographic group in the country, the Latino community."" Hispanics were vital in helping the president win in two of the key battleground states,  Nevada (70% to 25%) and Colorado (75% to 23%), and put Obama in the lead in Florida, where the vote still hasn't been decided, according to exit polls. In Nevada, the president won six electoral votes and nine in Colorado. Obama's popularity with Latino voters in Florida is credited to the growth in the Puerto Rican population in central Florida.Of all Latinos in Florida, 34% are Cuban and 57% are non-Cuban, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. ""If we don't do better with Hispanics, we'll be out of the White House forever,"" said Republican strategist and CNN contributor Ana Navarro, who was the national Hispanic co-chair of McCain's  presidential campaign. Zuania CapÃ³-Ramos of Puerto Rico moved to New York just in time for the 2008 elections, but she didn't vote until this year. ""I had just come to the U.S. and still did not quite understand how to work the election process in this country. I felt misinformed regarding the difference between political parties,"" CapÃ³-Ramos said. ""Obama seemed like an excellent candidate, however, it was not until the most recent elections that I became active in American politics and issues affecting the Latino community."" Pew Hispanic Center's analysis of exit poll data stated that 77% of Hispanic voters said undocumented immigrants should be offered a chance to apply for legal status, while 18% said such immigrants should be deported. Among all voters, fewer than two thirds (65%) said these immigrants should be offered a chance to apply for legal status, while 28% say they should be deported. ""When Mitt Romney brought on Kris Kobach as his adviser for his campaign, that really made an impact on the Latino community,"" said Leo Pierson,  a campaign surrogate for the Ohio Latino Leadership Council to Re-Elect President Obama. Pierson started volunteering in March 2011 and provided guidance on Latino affairs and outreach in Ohio for the campaign. Latinos only make up 3% of the swing state's population, according to the Pew Hispanic Center, of which Obama received 53% of the Latino vote. ""The GOP drove Latinos away with their anti-Latino agenda in being very vocal on 'self-deportation',"" said Pierson. ""It didn't help that Mitt Romney said the Arizona immigration law was the model for the nation. That stuff sticks."" Romney said he only supported the E-verify portion of the controversial Arizona immigration law, also known as SB 1070. After he made that statement, his opponents were able to characterize his support as being for the entire law, and that alienated many Latino voters. However, Latino voters might have made up their minds in 2011, when Mitt Romney stated he would veto the DREAM Act, but his reluctance during the second presidential debate to provide specifics on an alternative approach on immigration reform could have sealed the deal for most Latinos. Romney said that he would offer a path to undocumented immigrants serving in the military but did not give details as to what he would do for the remainder of the 1.4 million undocumented immigrants who would qualify for citizenship under Obama's plan, which allows undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children to apply for legal status. While some Hispanic voters were disappointed with  Obama's failure to achieve comprehensive immigration reform, which he considered his ""biggest failure,"" he said it wasn't ""for a lack of trying or desire,"" during a Univision forum in September. However, that doesn't relieve the pressure many Latinos have put upon the newly re-elected president. ""My hope for Obama as a woman, as a Latina, as a Puerto Rican, is that he keeps his word and all the promises he has made to us,"" stressed CapÃ³-Ramos. ""I hope he conserves his integrity, prevails in government, and that he puts the people as priority over economic interests, political or partisan.""","Latino vote helped Obama win in battleground states, made up 10% of electorate for first time .

"Atlanta (CNN)Faith leaders from the Atlanta area gathered at the state capitol for a rally with a message: ""Freedom of speech and freedom of religion are under attack."" The Family Research Council organized the gathering in support of Atlanta's recently fired fire chief, Kelvin Cochran. Cochran self-published the book ""Who Told You That You Were Naked.""  The GA Voice cited two passages from the book, which refers to homosexuality as unclean, inappropriate, vile and vulgar. When his book became public, Cochran was suspended and ultimately fired by Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed. The president of the Family Research Council, Tony Perkins, along with other rally organizers and supporters, delivered nearly 40,000 petitions to city hall in support of Cochran.  ""The naked truth is that the actions taken against the chief are designed to send a message that will silence Christians and in effect force them to check their faith at the door of public service,"" he said. In a written statement, Reed said this is not about religious beliefs but ""the city's nondiscrimination policy is nonnegotiable.""  ""Neither race, nor gender, nor religion, nor creed, nor sexual orientation, nor physical ability, nor gender identity will be used to discriminate against any city of Atlanta employee."" Cochran spoke at the rally and said his religious beliefs have not created a hostile work environment and there has been no discrimination against any member of the LGBT community.  ""There are grave consequences for publicly expressing our faith and having the audacity to believe that sex was created for procreation and should be in the bonds of holy matrimony between a man and a woman,"" Cochran said. His sentiments were echoed by other faith leaders who spoke in support of him. ""How are you going to tell me that I can't say what the Bible says everywhere?"" asked Bishop Wellington Boone, president of the Fellowship of International Churches.  ""If the Bible says that a level of acts of behavior is vile affections, it's clearly vile affections,"" he said. Cochran, a 34-year veteran of the firefighting profession, has spent the last seven years working for the Atlanta Fire and Rescue Department.  He said his termination was unjust. ""All people, groups are welcomed and embraced in the city of Atlanta, except the groups that believe the scripture regarding God's purpose for sex,"" he said. Reed said Cochran's comments eroded his confidence in the chief.  ""Every single employee under the fire chief's command deserves the certainty that he or she is a valued member of the team and that fairness and respect guide employment decisions,"" Reed said. Reed also said Cochran failed to notify him about his plans to publish the book and called it an ""irreconcilable lapse in judgment.""  Cochran said he received permission to write the book from the ethics director. Cochran expressed his gratitude to his supporters and maintained: ""One thing we should not have to sacrifice are the freedoms inherit in our great nation: free speech and freedom of religion.""","Kelvin Cochran's book, ""Who Told You That You Were Naked,"" decries homosexuality .

"San Francisco (CNN) -- Three weeks and about 400 miles ago, I started a trip down the ""most endangered"" river in the United States, California's San Joaquin. The underloved river is born in the Sierra Nevada and snakes across one of the most productive agricultural regions in the world, California's Central Valley. I finished that journey -- which mostly involved kayaking, but also a fair bit of walking, since the San Joaquin runs dry for about 40 miles -- on Friday beneath the Golden Gate Bridge here in San Francisco. It was a moment I'll always remember: that behemoth, cardinal-red bridge towering overhead, clanging in the wind, the distant roar of traffic, water rushing through a 1.7-mile channel that drains about 40% of this country-sized state's land area. The ocean tossed the kayak around like a piece of dough. Thirty-five mph winds seared salt water to my face, and tears of joy ran down my cheeks. It was thrilling but also bittersweet. I knew that not a single drop of San Joaquin water made it to the bridge, which should be the end of the river. All of it -- 100% -- is diverted for a variety of human uses, mostly for farming. As I crossed under the bridge, which separates the San Francisco Bay from the Pacific Ocean, my thoughts were as choppy as the water. But between ""Don't flip!"" and ""ROCK!"" I looked up at the bridge and remembered a moment from my June 11 hike at the headwaters of the San Joaquin. I could hear the river rumbling down in a valley to the left on that mountain trail, and I said something to my hiking companion, Darin McQuoid -- a pro kayaker who goes careening off 80-foot waterfalls like it's no big thing -- about how, to me, the river sounded like a highway. No, he said, it's the opposite. Highways sound like rivers. That's so true. And it really clicked for me in that moment. After three weeks on the river, I was finally starting to see things from the water's perspective. Rivers, of course, are the original highways. The roaring traffic above on the Golden Gate reminded me of the San Joaquin in its early, healthy stretches. But for most of us, traffic is far more familiar. We've become a people disconnected from the water. We don't know rivers. We don't know where they start, where they're going, when they're full, why they're dry. We don't know enough to understand why -- long after the Huck Finn era -- they still shape our lives, they're still worthy of our attention and unyielding respect. I hope this trip is part of a much broader effort to change that. To tilt our collective thinking toward a focus on water, and its great shepherds, the rivers. I could go on for MANY more paragraphs about the journey -- about the farmers, bird-lovers, migrant workers, fish biologists, dam operators, boat nuts and barefoot skiers I met along the way. I'll do that at a later date as part of our Change the List project. For now, I wanted to say a heartfelt thank you to all of the readers who followed my voyage down the San Joaquin so diligently -- and helpfully -- on social media. Some of you sent me scientific reports about locations I was passing; others actually met me out on the river to share a piece of your story. Two science teachers brought me a burrito beneath a bridge. One woman stood at the edge of her family farm for two hours waiting for me to pass. For all of that I am forever grateful. It's incredible that you cared about this story so deeply. You were an essential part of it. You shaped my path. So, I'll say it again, since I don't enough: Thank you. You readers are awesome. AND: I do have a favor to ask. I'd like to ask you to turn your gaze toward rivers, too. CNN iReport is inviting you to send in photos, videos or essays about your favorite rivers. It could be a river you saw on vacation or one in your backyard. Tell us a little bit about it and it may be featured as part of a list of ""our favorite rivers.""

"(CNN)In one month Nigerians will vote in what may be the country's most competitive and contentious elections yet. But this important process will take place in the shadow of a worsening threat -- Boko Haram, the Islamist insurgent group otherwise known as Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'awati wal-Jihad, which killed as many as 2,000 people in the northeastern town of Baga on January 3. The attacks of the past few weeks -- Boko Haram's biggest ever in terms of casualties on Baga, and on markets using children to detonate devices -- have drawn international focus back to the crisis. But such appalling events are not new -- they are an intensification, a next step in a crisis which has steadily worsened since Boko Haram's 2010 reemergence. And they raise a number of questions about the trajectory of the insurgency and the response to it. Why did Boko Haram take Baga now? For Boko Haram, taking Baga -- a small town in Nigeria's Borno State -- closes a gap in its map, fulfills a strategic purpose with its proximity to the border with Chad, where it is reported to have set up camps on islands in Lake Chad, and further bolsters its resources and sense of confidence with a win over a multinational military force. The small town near Lake Chad was home to the base of the Multinational Joint Task Force, comprising troops from Nigeria, Niger and Chad -- but despite the military presence, Baga was surrounded in the country's northeastern corner by what has become Boko Haram territory. The most recent attack was not the first fighting Baga had seen: in April 2013 nearly 200 people were killed and around 2,000 homes burnt by insurgents and soldiers in attacks and counterattacks, according to Human Rights Watch. Baga was already vulnerable. What do latest attacks say about Boko Haram's tactics? The history of Boko Haram is one of ever-expanding extremes.  Looking back at the changing situation in the northeast and the nature of Boko Haram's targets and scale of its attacks, there are events since 2009 that can be seen as markers in the next stage of its evolution -- from the extrajudicial killing of the movement's founder Mohammed Yusuf in 2009, to the 2011 suicide attack on police headquarters in Abuja, to the 2013 introduction of the state of emergency in three northeastern states, to last year's killing of schoolboys and abduction of the Chibok schoolgirls. The scale of the killings in Baga and the reported use of children, perhaps as young as ten, to carry and detonate bombs is Boko Haram further pushing the boundaries of what it will do. The indiscriminate ferocity of its killings isn't necessarily all about tactics. There still isn't a clear picture of what happened at Baga and who did the killing -- the age, the motivation, the state of mind of what may have been militants, conscripts or armed and terrified child combatants. What is clear is that Boko Haram kills because it can and because it's likely those who are not core loyalists or ideologues are expendable resources for the movement. Whereas previously its attacks had been in revenge for some grievance or focused on the Nigerian state, it has become much harder to explain its targets and identify its endgame. Is Nigeria doing enough? The 7th Division of the Nigerian army has been struggling to respond effectively to an insurgency that abducts and uses civilians, that is well equipped with captured military hardware and that knows the terrain of the region better than a federal force which comprises troops unfamiliar with the context, people and language in the northeast. The overstretch of this force is showing. There are many potential reasons for this overstretch -- from lack of clear directive, to lack of equipment and training. Many also cite corruption: billions of dollars have been spent as a result of the insurgency, but it is not clear what proportion of this has been spent in or on the fight in Borno State. The federal government has been silent on or has had a delayed response to many attacks and key developments during this crisis. As criticism increases of the federal government for its handling of the threat, which has gotten worse over the years, a lack of or confused messaging only bolsters perceptions that it sees the situation in the northeast as peripheral or as a conspiracy to discredit President Goodluck Jonathan and his administration. Is the international community doing enough? Boko Haram is a Nigerian movement that is mostly targeting Nigerians. Nigeria's federal government and security agencies have the responsibility for resolving this crisis in cooperation with regional and international actors, who look to the Nigerian government and forces to lead and coordinate. Nigeria's international partners offered assistance in training, advice and technical support, and some of this was accepted after the Chibok abductions of April 2014 and amid the international outcry that followed. The international community could do more to speak with one voice and coordinate better amongst itself to galvanize further and faster action in Nigeria, back those agencies and actors which are making progress, and identify gaps for greater support. An immediate priority is humanitarian relief and energies need to be focused on how to get essential help to internally displaced people and refugees. Will the latest attacks affect next month's election? The attack in itself is unlikely to have an effect on the outcome of the elections, but security and law and order are a primary concern for all Nigerians. Some voters -- not all -- will assess Goodluck Jonathan's performance as president since 2011 through his handling of the Boko Haram crisis. What kind of threat does Boko Haram pose regionally now? Despite increased attacks in northern Cameroon and growing concern in southern Niger and western Chad, it is not clear that Boko Haram would seek immediately to open new fronts in this conflict by taking on the armies of Chad and Niger. As Nigeria's army pushes back, Boko Haram may continue to look across borders for refuge. The war economy of the northeast is also poorly understood; it is possible that these border regions are important in order for Boko Haram to sustain itself as the economy in the northeast declines as farming and fishing have become impossible. Should the West be worried? The West -- and others -- should be worried because of the human cost of the Boko Haram crisis and the legacy this violence will leave. With a few exceptions, Boko Haram has not attacked western targets; its focus is Nigeria. But Nigeria is Africa's largest economy, democracy and producer of crude oil -- it is important to the stability and economy of the region. African leaders and Nigeria's international partners should also be worried if a more effective response is not forthcoming from Nigeria, and if Boko Haram seeks to start pushing south and west in the country. In the immediate term, it is crucial that the Nigerian military protects state capitals in the northeast and that Nigeria holds credible elections in a month's time. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.","Boko Haram massacred as many as 2,000 people in Baga, Nigeria on January 3 .

"Tromso, Norway (CNN)It is early afternoon on board the ""Helmer Hanssen,"" and the Arctic sun is already starting to set. Near the back of the ship, two people dressed in orange rain slickers are anxiously waiting. Any minute now, the ship's lines will pull taut, and a green mesh bag will be back up on deck. When that time comes, a sigh of relief as crewmembers empty out the full bag onto the deck. Stepping forward are Jeannette Anderson, a cell biologist, and Robert Johansen, a marine biologist. The pile of dirt, sea sponges, and starfish from the ocean floor are what they came all this way for. Above the Arctic Circle in the Lyngen Fjord of northern Norway, researchers on the ""Helmer Hanssen"" are searching for the next generation of antibiotics. In these sea organisms, they hope, are new bacteria to become those drugs. ""If no one finds new antibiotics for common infections, what will happen is we will go back to the pre-antibiotic age in which a simple cut could turn into an infection that becomes deadly,"" said Marcel Jaspars. Jaspars is the founder of the PharmaSea project, an EU-funded initiative to bring research groups together around the world in search of new antibiotics. The World Health Organization says antibiotic resistance is a growing health crisis around the world, calling it ""an increasingly serious threat to global public health that requires action across all government sectors and society."" It is not cost-effective for pharmaceutical companies to search for new antibiotics. On average, it costs a pharmaceutical company more than $2 billion to bring a new drug to market. In the case of antibiotics, the drug is only taken for a short time, and could eventually develop resistance. That's why large-scale focus has moved away from antibiotics research in the past 30 years. In the meantime, bacteria have evolved, adapted, and become resistant to many current antibiotics. ""What was once common treatments are no longer treatable by using standard antibiotics,"" Jaspars said. The key is finding new chemistry. Bacteria can't be resistant to a drug if they've never seen anything like it before. Extreme environments are providing new places to look. ""In the past, bacteria and fungi have been the main sources for new antibiotics,"" Jaspars explained. ""In fact, about 70% of our antibiotics still come from nature, normally from sediment samples and soil samples from land. But now, by looking at the ocean, we hope to find new life forms which give us new chemistry that might be able to treat bacterial infections."" That's exactly why Anderson and Johansen are on board the ""Helmer Hanssen."" They are part of Jaspars' PharmaSea team, and they have identified the icy waters of the Norwegian Arctic as a potential breeding ground of new bacteria. In this extreme environment, the sea organisms have been forced to adapt over time. ""They have to adjust for very different temperatures as compared to other parts of the world,"" Anderson said. ""We think that since they are living in an extreme environment, they have developed some extreme strategies to survive."" Anderson and Johansen take their finds from the bottom of the sea straight to a wet lab on the ship. It is critical to begin testing as soon as possible, ensuring freshness of the organisms. Johansen cuts open the starfish, while Anderson makes solutions to be plated on a petri dish. In a few weeks, bacteria will grow on the plates, hopefully exhibiting antibacterial properties. It is a long and tedious process, with no time to waste. It often takes upwards of a decade for new drugs to be approved. ""It's a rush against time,"" Anderson said. ""I think we have to speed up the process of trying to find novel antibiotics. At the moment, a lot of the antibiotics out there are working in the same way."" The early results are promising. Several compounds being tested in Norway and at Jaspars' lab in Scotland are showing initial signs of antibacterial properties. A good start, with a long way to go, but Jaspars knows the hopeful legacy of the PharmaSea project and others like is around the world is to eradicate the issue of antibiotic resistance. Who knows where the next penicillin will be found? Perhaps, it will be in the icy Norwegian Arctic. ""It is always very exciting when you get to the stage where you are the first person to see a bacteria,"" said Jaspars, ""or the first person to identify the structure of a new molecule that has the potential at that moment, to be a treatment for a difficult disease.""","Researchers are looking for new bacteria in Arctic circle .

"The critical Java vulnerability that is currently under attack was made possible by an incomplete patch Oracle developers issued last year to fix an earlier security bug, a researcher said. The revelation, made Friday by Adam Gowdiak of Poland-based Security Explorations, is the latest black eye for Oracle's Java software framework which is installed on more than 1 billion PCs, smartphones, and other devices. Miscreants use these exploits to turn compromised websites into platforms for silently installing keyloggers and other types of malicious software on the computers of unsuspecting visitors. Last year saw a steady stream of attacks that exploited Java vulnerabilities, allowing miscreants to surreptitiously install keyloggers and other malicious software when unwitting people browsed compromised websites. The abuse has already continued into 2013, when on Thursday researchers reported yet another critical bug that is being ""massively exploited in the wild"". According to Gowdiak, the latest vulnerability is a holdover from a bug (referred to here as Issue 32) that Security Explorations researchers reported to Oracle in late August. Oracle released a patch for the issue in October but it was incomplete, he said in an e-mail to Ars that was later published to the Bugtraq mailing list. ""Bugs are like mushrooms, in many cases they can be found in a close proximity to those already spotted,"" Gowdiak wrote. ""It looks like Oracle either stopped the picking too early or they are still deep in the woods."" Oracle representatives didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. This post will be updated if a reply comes later. People who don't use Java much should once again consider unplugging Java from their browser, while those who don't use it at all may want to uninstall it altogether. The release notes for Java 7 Update 10—the most recent version—say users can disable the program from the browser by accessing the Java Control Panel. KrebsOnSecurity has instructions here for other ways to do this. Exploits of the latest Java vulnerability, which were first observed more than a month ago, are the combination of two bugs. The first involves the Class.forName() method and allows the loading of arbitrary (restricted) classes. The second bug relies on the invokeWithArguments method call and was also a problem with Issue 32 that Oracle purportedly patched in October. ""However, it turns out that the fix was not complete as one can still abuse invokeWithArguments method to setup calls to invokeExact method with a trusted system class as a target method caller,"" Gowdiak wrote. ""This time the call is however done to methods of new Reflection API (from java.lang.invoke.* package), of which many rely on security checks conducted against the caller of the target method."" Developers of the Metasploit framework for hackers and penetration testers have released a module that should exploit the vulnerability on machines running Windows, Apple OS X, and Linux regardless of the browser they're using. The US-CERT, which is affiliated with the Department of Homeland Security, is advising people to disable Java in Web browsers.","Java vulnerability is due to incomplete patch by Oracle, researcher says .

"Most people like to know what they are eating.  However, labeling for genetically modified organisms is not required in any state. This is largely because of the money expended by GM seed producers toward blocking food-labeling laws. A common claim made by this group is that GM foods have been proved safe to eat and that there is a global scientific consensus to support this statement; therefore, no labeling is needed. However, an examination of the scientific data, along with discussions on this topic in other countries, show that both claims are blatantly false.  What is the evidence that some GM foods are hazardous to human health and that consumers should be able to make a choice based upon this information? When GMOs were introduced nearly 20 years ago, there was the promise of crops with increased yields and resistant to flooding and salt. Since then, traditional breeding methods have created commercial varieties with these traits, while genetic engineering has created none. For example, recently published data show that conventional breeding of corn and soy increases yields to a greater extent than GM technologies. With the promise of reducing the use of agricultural chemicals, most of the current GM crops are supposedly either insect or herbicide resistant. In reality, GM crops have fostered an epidemic of herbicide resistant weeds and insects that are no longer killed by the built-in toxins. The result is a massive increase in herbicide use -- an additional 527 million pounds over the past 16 years.  The major herbicide, glyphosate, is found inside the GM plants we eat, leading to its detection in people. Future GM crops will likely trigger a greater use of more toxic herbicides such as 2,4-D, a component of the Agent Orange defoliant deployed in Vietnam.  In addition to these problems, there is increasing evidence that GM crops and the chemicals required for their production are harmful to humans. An Associated Press story in October documented the large increase in cancer and birth defects in commercial farming areas of Argentina since the introduction of GM crops. These data confirm recent animal studies showing that GM corn and the herbicides sprayed on it caused a dramatic increase in cancer in the same strain of rats used in FDA drug safety tests.  Another large study showed an increase in severe stomach inflammation in pigs caused by GM feed containing insecticidal toxins, a condition that would likely lead to cancer in humans. Since it takes many years for diseases such as cancer to appear, we could be reaching that point in time after the introduction of GM crops.  What has been the reaction in the rest of the world to this and similar information? The European Union has tightened its GM food safety testing requirements as consumers continue to reject GM foods, resulting in the withdrawal of investment from two large GM seed producers, Monsanto and BASF. India, Peru, Bolivia, the Philippines and Mexico have issued moratoria on GM food crops to go along with Japan, South Korea and a large number of other countries. Scientists in Russia have proposed a total ban on all GM products. And China, which initially embraced the technology, is  having an extended debate about GM crops. The world's food authority, Codex Alimentarius, agreed in 2011 that GM food labels are justified to trace back any adverse health effects of GMOs. As a result of these new revelations about GM technology, the industry is making a major public relations effort to promote itself, often falsely claiming that there is a ""consensus"" among scientists that the technology is safe. In reality, there is no evidence that GM food is safe for human consumption, nor is there any consensus on this topic within the scientific community. It is critical for the public to educate itself about the realities of GMOs and not be fooled by the rhetoric from companies that sell it. Most of the world has studied this issue and concluded that GMOs are not worth the risk.  Passing GM labeling initiatives in states will be the initial demonstration that the public understands what is at stake. At the very least, labeling may help reverse the unsustainable trend in this country towards ever increasing industrial GMO farming.","David Schubert: Seed producers say there's scientific consensus on GMO safety .

"(CNN)The last time Dr. Rick Sacra went to Liberia, he returned home to the United States in a medevac airplane, not sure if he would die of the Ebola he'd contracted while taking care of patients. But Sacra recovered from the virus he contracted in August and Thursday he is headed back to Liberia. He calls the West African nation his ""second home."" He lived there from 1995 to 2010 and has made about a dozen trips since then. But he said this time he'll have a different perspective. ""Having spent three days in the treatment unit in Liberia, I really feel for those who are sick,"" Sacra said from his home in Holden, Massachusetts. The third American to contract Ebola, Sacra remembers the ""spartan"" Liberian hospital with the uncomfortably thin mattress and the ever-present strong smell of bleach. Because doctors and nurses had to suit up in protective care, they only came around to see patients every three hours, so if he needed something he had to wait. ""You spend a lot of time alone and lonely,"" he said. Sacra said he hopes this makes him a better doctor. ""I think it makes me more sensitive to where people are coming from and how they might be feeling and why they might be discouraged,"" he said. Sacra was evacuated from Liberia to Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, one of four hospitals in the United States with a biocontainment unit, where he received a blood transfusion from Dr. Kent Brantly, another American Ebola survivor, and the experimental drug TKM-Ebola. ""I never felt like I was not going to make it,"" he said when he was released from the hospital on September 25. This upcoming trip will be easier than his August trip in one big way: He won't have to worry about contracting Ebola, because he's now immune to the strain of the disease responsible for the current epidemic. But it will be more difficult in another way: He knows many of his friends in Liberia lost family members and colleagues to Ebola this fall, and he won't be able to comfort them with a hug, because hugging, or even shaking hands, is forbidden in order to cut down on the spread of the disease. He said now that the number of Ebola patients in Liberia has gone down dramatically, he's not needed to work in the Ebola ward. Instead, he'll be involved in evaluating and triaging patients who come into the ELWA Hospital, run by SIM, a Christian missionary group. He hopes to return to his regular schedule of working four weeks in Liberia every three months. He said he misses the food --  potato greens, palm butter and peanut soup -- and he misses his friends and colleagues. He also hopes his trip reminds the rest of the world that Ebola, and many other diseases, are still a huge threat in West Africa. ""The needs in Liberia are still tremendous,"" he said. ""Even before Ebola the health care system was very weak and barely functioning. I just feel that God has opened the door for me to make a difference. I was to continue doing that if I can."" CNN's Debra Goldschmidt contributed to this report.","American Dr. Rick Sacra was medevaced back to the U.S. sick with Ebola .

"(CNN) -- Online hackers have pirated the PBS website and posted a false story claiming the rapper Tupac Shakur -- who has been dead for almost 15 years -- is alive and living in New Zealand. The group -- called The Lulz Boat -- also posted what it said were passwords of journalists, login information for the PBS series ""Frontline"" and sensitive information about PBS stations. The Lulz Boat claims it was ""less than impressed"" after watching the network's program ""WikiSecrets"" and ""decided to sail our Lulz Boat over the PBS servers for further... perusing.""

"Bad news, guys: The pangolin we adopted is missing. You may recall a vote I held online recently -- asking readers to suggest new names for pangolin P26, who was released into a national park in Vietnam in March. The names you suggested were lovely: Pemalu, which is Indonesian for ""shy""; Bao, which is Vietnamese for ""protection."" And -- Sandshrew, a scale-covered Pokemon character that even I'll admit does bear a striking resemblance to a real-life panoglin. Of course, since you're the Internet, you voted up Sandshrew. So that's P26's new name. And now Sandshrew is missing. I'm not drawing any correlation between the two. Obviously. Of course not ... Let me back up in case you haven't been following this story: Pangolins are thought to be the most trafficked mammals in the world. They're traded illegally and by the ton for their scales, which are used in traditional medicine and for their meat, which is a delicacy in Vietnam and China. I recently spent some time investigating the pangolin trade in Southeast Asia as part of CNN's Change the List project. One pangolin I met was named P26 -- and had been seized from the illegal trade and taken to the Carnivore and Pangolin Conservation Program in Vietnam. He recently was released into Cat Tien National Park. I thought it would be fun for CNN's audience to adopt and rename the pangolin, and the researchers who care for him kindly agreed. Turns out, the researchers kind of like the name Sandshrew. ""I guess it is kinda cute(ish),"" one wrote in an e-mail. ""Well, anything is better than P26 right?!"" And they think it might help with his rescue. In a Wednesday blog post, Louise Fletcher, from the conservation program, wrote that P26's (sorry, Sandshrew's) radio tracking device had partially fallen off his tail. This happens quite a lot with this type of pangolin, she told me. The transmitting devices are fairly clunky, and they're screwed into a scale that's made of fingernail material. Now, she is scouring the forest trying to find him. She's set up ""camera traps"" that might snap a photo of the nocturnal animal if he's roaming around at night, looking for ants. And she's spending some time just wandering the park at night hoping to see him. No luck so far. ""Maybe if the voting by CNN readers is complete on deciding P26′s new name, I can see if whispering it as we walk through the forest on Thursday night will be successful in coaxing him into view!"" she wrote. Maybe! I hope so. I sent her an e-mail telling her the new name for P26 is Sandshrew. I'm holding out hope that Fletcher will find him by whispering ""Saaaandshrewwwww"" into the forest of Vietnam. I kind of love imagining that scene, and wish her luck. If you want to follow her progress, and Sandshrew's, check out her blog. And thanks to everyone who voted. One more favor to ask: Maybe the fact that there's a real-life endangered creature named after a video game character means Nintendo and Pokemon will start supporting pangolin conservation? Maybe someone can suggest that by starting a Change.org petition? So far, more than 4,000 people have signed a reader's petition asking for Disney to put a pangolin in a movie. Maybe there's a similarly creative ask for Pokemon? For more in this series, visit CNN.com/Change.","CNN readers vote on the name ""Sandshrew"" for a pangolin in Vietnam .

"(CNN)Pope Francis used a punch to make a point about the limits of free expression, but he ended up on the defensive because of it -- with a Vatican spokesman saying it was ""in no way intended to be interpreted as justification for the violence and terror that took place in Paris last week."" The Pope made the gesture and accompanying remarks while flying from Sri Lanka to the Philippines, where he started a five-day visit Thursday. He didn't mention Charlie Hebdo, the satirical magazine that was targeted by terrorists after it depicted the Prophet Mohammed in cartoons, something that many Muslims find offensive. The Paris magazine became a terrorist target after publishing one such cartoon years ago, and after last week's attack, it placed Mohammed on its cover, this time showing him crying and holding a sign with the rallying cry ""Je suis Charlie,"" French for ""I am Charlie."" Still, even if he didn't explicitly name the publication, the Pope was clear that he was referring to the general debate over what's happened in France, including how people might react if they feel someone made a slight to their religious faith. Everyone has not only the liberty, but also the obligation, ""to say what he thinks to help the common good,"" Francis said. However, they should not do so if it offends people. And if someone does get offended? The Pope made reference to Alberto Gasbarri, a man who organizes papal trips and was then standing next to him on the plane. ""If Dr. Gasbarri, a great friend, says a swear word against my mother, then a punch awaits him,"" Francis said. ""It's normal, it's normal. One cannot provoke, one cannot insult other people's faith, one cannot make fun of faith."" While making this comment, Vatican Radio reported that the pontiff ""gestured with a pretend punch"" directed at Gasbarri -- an action many journalists interpreted as a joke. Notably, in the same conversation, Francis steadfastly denounced the terrorists' killings and the idea that anyone -- as the France attackers apparently did -- could pretend to justify such violence in the name of God. ""One cannot make war (or) kill in the name of one's own religion,"" Francis said on his way to the Philippines. ""... To kill in the name of God is an aberration."" The Vatican later responded to a CNN question about the ""punch"" remark specifically. In an email, Vatican spokesman Thomas Rosica told CNN that ""the Pope's expression is in no way intended to be interpreted"" as somehow justifying last week's violence, and he pointed out that ""the Pope has spoken out clearly against the terror and violence that occurred in Paris and in other parts of the world."" ""The Pope's words about Dr. Gasbarri were spoken colloquially and in (a) friendly, intimate manner among colleagues and friends,"" Rosica said Thursday. ""His response might be similar to something each of us has felt when those dearest to us are insulted or harmed."" Rosica explained Francis' remarks as consistent with his ""free style of speech,"" a plainspoken and conversational approach that has earned him admirers. Such remarks ""must be taken at face value and not distorted or manipulated,"" the Vatican spokesman said. In fact, the Pope has been one of the world's most outspoken advocates for peace and against war since taking that position in 2013. And what he said on the Manila-bound plane doesn't change that, according to Rosica. ""Pope Francis has not advocated violence with his words on the flight,"" the spokesman said.","Pope Francis throws a pretend punch to make a point about how offended people may respond .
He does so while talking about the France terror attacks and the debate over free expression .
A Vatican spokesman says Francis' words didn't advocate violence or justify the attacks ."
"Violence in Iraq has spiked in the last year, according to the United Nations, but as has become the case with Syria, it's rarely news if the day's deaths are ""only"" in the tens. The same Western governments who led the invasion of Iraq in 2003 are now looking away, seeing Iraq as the problem of previous administrations, and being preoccupied with fresher crises in Syria and Egypt. The impression of constant bad news belies the reality that violence in Iraq had for some time been reduced, but is rapidly becoming worse again. More than 1,000 civilians died in July, levels not seen since the dark days of 2006-07. Such violence is not a permanent reality for Iraq, but is symptomatic of political failures. Some Western commentators portray Iraq as a basket case, condemned to perpetual violence, reflecting something fundamentally wrong with Iraqi culture and society. This conveniently absolves the rest of the world of their shared responsibility for building up a political system where violence has been the main political currency, not just since 2003 but for years under the previous regime. Saddam Hussein's 1980s war with Iran was encouraged by the West and by Iraq's Gulf neighbors, who turned a blind eye to his domestic repression and ethnic cleansing. After the 1991 Gulf war, internationally-imposed sanctions hollowed out Iraq's middle class and made many Iraqis turn to corruption and organized crime to survive. Examining the political causes of Iraq's violence -- going beyond the caricatured and historical view that it is inevitable or permanent -- matters for the whole Middle East. Iraq is not only geographically central, with about 30 million people and the world's fifth largest oil reserves; it has historically been a center of ideas. Given Iraq's international influence, the 2003 invasion was overtly designed not just to remove an anti-Western regime, but to reshape the Middle East. But rather than becoming a model for democracy and the free market, the example of Iraq has been used by conservative forces in the region to bolster their traditional pretense that the only political choices for Arabs are authoritarian government or chaos. The violence between Sunni and Shia political factions has also generated fears of wider sectarian conflict across the region, although violence occurs within, as well as between, religious groups, and its causes are political more than religious. The first reason for the recent spike in violence has been the spillover of fighting and tensions from the civil war in neighboring Syria. There are close links between Iraqi and Syrian societies and families, and as the conflict in Syria has become increasingly sectarian and internationalized, fighters from Iraq are now involved on both sides. The recent split between the Syrian National Council and jihadi groups such as the Islamic state of Iraq and Syria might present an opportunity for Iraq's government to reconceptualize its interests in Syria. Despite their shared alliance with Iran, just a few years ago the Iraqi and Syrian governments were at loggerheads as Iraq suspected Syria of facilitating the entry of al Qaeda fighters into its own territory. Iraq's second problem is that it remains an arena where regional powers vie for influence, with Iran supporting the Shia ruling coalition, Saudi Arabia supporting Sunni groups and the secular Shia leader Iyad Allawi, and Turkey becoming ever closer to the Kurds. Personal animosity between the leaders of Iraq and Saudi Arabia contributes to their poor relations, with Saudi Arabia still unwilling to open an embassy in Iraq more than a decade after the invasion. But the situation is not as simple as an inevitable tension between Sunnis and Shia. The Saudi king is said to respect Iraq's main Shia cleric, Ayatollah Ali Al Sistani. Encouraging religious dialogue between Sunni and Shia clerics could be a useful aspect of conflict resolution. And the recent talks between the U.S. and Iran is also an opportunity for Iraq to act as a bridge, as one of the few countries to have strong relations with both. The third main driver of the current violence is the threat Iraq faces from al Qaeda  -- and the political failure of the Iraqi government's approach to fighting it. Back in 2007, thousands of Iraqi Sunnis fought with the U.S. against al Qaeda. But rather than working with mainstream Sunni political groups to build a united front against violent jihadis, the Baghdad government has treated the former as a political threat. This was epitomized by a death sentence passed against a Sunni former vice-president, Tariq Al Hashemi, in 2012 for allegedly organizing death squads, when Shia politicians who have headed militias have been accommodated politically (notably, the Badr Brigade, with a long record of sectarian violence, were absorbed into the national police). Protesters in Sunni-majority provinces have called for changes to terrorism and de-Baathification laws that they say treat all Sunnis as potential suspects. Both Syria and Iraq are rife with case studies of the ways in which human beings can be radicalized and brutalized. Perhaps Westerners find it easier to blame nebulous ""cultural"" factors than to imagine that we, too, could turn to violence and extremes if the states around us collapsed, and if we found ourselves in constant insecurity, with only sectarian or ethnic groups, and their militias, prepared to provide us with protection and services. But there is a need to refocus on Iraq, as part of a broader strategy towards addressing the complex and interconnected problems across the Middle East, though that will take more time and resources than continuing to lurch from crisis to crisis.","Iraq violence is news if the day's deaths are ""only"" in the tens, says Jane Kinninmont .
Violence between Sunni and Shia factions has stoked fears of regional conflict, she adds .
Personal animosity between Iraq and Saudi Arabia doesn't help resolution - Kinninmont .
Iraq's second problem is that regional powers vie for influence, she argues ."
"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Fighting raged in Afghanistan over the weekend, with a suicide bombing slaying six people, a NATO-led soldier and an Afghan police officer dying in an ""altercation,"" and troops killing several insurgents in battles, authorities said. Fighting between the Taliban and NATO forces continues to rage in Afghanistan. The suicide bombing on Sunday killed six people in a bazaar in Spin Boldak, located in Kandahar province, NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) said on Monday. Along with the deaths, at least 17 people were wounded, and ISAF condemned the assault. Four of those killed were Afghan border police officers, ISAF said. The location is in southern Afghanistan. The ISAF soldier and an Afghan police officer were killed after seven people were apprehended in connection with a roadside bombing in Paktia province on Sunday that targeted an Afghan National Police and ISAF patrol. The location is in eastern Afghanistan. ""The detained civilians were then transferred to the ANP station at the Jaji District Center. While at the district center, there was an altercation during which an ANP officer and one ISAF soldier were killed,"" ISAF said in a Monday news release. The U.S.-led coalition on Monday reported fighting between U.S. and Afghan troops and insurgents over the last two days -- Sunday in Kandahar province and Saturday in Helmand province. ""Several insurgents"" were reported killed in both incidents. Two insurgents died in fighting on Friday in another southern region -- Zabul province, the coalition said on Monday.","Militants kill eight people and injure at least 17 in latest attacks .

"Northern Nigeria (CNN)I didn't want to ask the question. I could already guess the pain behind the answer. ""Do you think your husband is dead?"" Her mouth twists, contorting her young face, tears welling in her already reddened eyes. ""I don't know... I pray to God to give him another chance,"" she finally manages to stutter. Her sadness is heavy and blankets both of us. She tells me she has three children, and they last saw their father four months ago when he went back to his army unit on the front line in Nigeria's battle with the radical Islamist extremist group Boko Haram. Satellite images show devastation of Boko Haram attacks, rights groups say . His friends last saw him bloodied and shooting as Boko Haram fighters advanced and they all fled. If all this wasn't trauma enough, the young woman says the army has deserted her, too. ""They didn't tell me anything, they still haven't told me what happened and they didn't pay me anything and no one is feeding us in the barracks,"" she said. We are in northern Nigeria, a few hours' drive north of the capital where the mostly Muslim north meets the mostly Christian south. Just last month, a double suicide bombing killed 12 people in a busy central market in the region. Driving northeast of here toward the borders with Chad, Cameroon and Niger puts you in the heart of Boko Haram territory -- a land mass the size of Belgium. So it's no surprise that the area is home to many thousands of troops, and, as I am finding out, it's also the backdrop of many more heart-wrenching stories. A mile or so from his base, I meet a soldier on a remote windswept hill. He is a veteran of African Union and United Nations peacekeeping missions in Liberia and Sudan, a professional soldier. We sit on plastic chairs as he tells me his story. He, too, was left on the battlefield by his comrades as they fled for safety in the face of a Boko Haram attack. He doesn't blame them. ""The major problem the soldiers have is they don't have the equipment to fight,"" he says. Boko Haram has anti-aircraft guns, which he says are accurate up to three-quarters of a mile. All the Nigerian military has, he says, are AK47 small machine guns, accurate up to a few hundred meters. Often the Nigerian soldiers are given only 60 bullets each, so they quickly run out. Boko Haram, he says, has large supplies of ammunition and more fighters. Although the Nigerian soldiers do win some fights, he says they are regularly forced to turn tail and run for their lives by the sheer volume of gunfire from Boko Haram fighters. It took him three days -- on foot, alone -- to get back to his base, 70 kilometers away.  When he arrived,  his wife told him to quit the army, but his troubles were only just beginning. Army medics refused to pay the $200 for medicine to treat his injuries. Morale in the army is sinking, he says. That night, I meet a young officer, who, like the other soldier, is not authorized to talk to me. Our conversation is held in a hurry in a tiny darkened hut that sells biscuits and fizzy drinks at a roundabout on the outskirts of a town. Corruption, he tells me, is the root of the Nigerian military's problem. ""Not just the generals... everybody in the country wants to get rich by any means necessary,"" he says. The soldiers don't ever benefit from the billions allocated to the defense budget, he explains. He even had to buy his own uniform. ""The troop morale is actually very low, very low, because we are not issued a uniform, we buy the uniforms ourselves,"" he explained. The other soldier I met on the hill told me this, too. When they go into battle, no one has the same uniform, so when they run from Boko Haram it's chaos. They don't know who is friend or foe -- whom to shoot and whom to help. Most soldiers live in fear, the young officer tells me. A fear of what will happen to them, and how long they can survive in this battle, he says. The worrying doesn't stop there. They see enough war widows on the base to know the grim reality of what can happen to their loved ones if they die. A widow I meet explains. Her husband was killed in battle over a year ago, she tells me. ""When my husband died, they never called me to tell me that I lost my husband,"" she says. ""They buried him without notifying me."" She gets no army pension, and she says there are many more like her: they feel abandoned, afraid to speak out because they still live in the barracks. Government officials tell us they will look into these shortcomings, that they are working on getting better weapons for the troops. If they do, according to the soldiers I met, it will easily turn the tide in this war. Nigerian president in Boko Haram territory, spokesman says .","Some military families still don't know what's happened to their husbands, fathers .
The Nigerian military seems under-equipped compared to Boko Haram fighters .
Nigerian soldiers must buy their own uniforms ."
"Santiago de Compostela, Spain (CNN) -- The train races into view, and in the space of a heartbeat, the cars derail and crash into a wall of concrete, flipping onto their sides and skidding along the track with terrifying speed and force. Security footage shows the horror of the moment an express train derailed as it hurtled around a curve in northwestern Spain on Wednesday. A spokeswoman for the Spanish government in the Galicia region, speaking on routine condition of anonymity, confirmed 80 people have died in the crash. A woman from Arlington, Virginia, is among the dead. And at least five other U.S. citizens were injured, Deputy State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said. Flames burst out of one train car as another car was snapped in half after the crash. Rescue crews and fellow passengers pulled bodies through broken windows and pried open doors as stunned survivors looked on. Investigations into the cause of the crash continue, but suggestions that the train was traveling too fast appear to be gaining weight. The train driver is being questioned by police and is under formal investigation, said Maria Pardo Rios, a spokeswoman for the Galicia regional supreme court. ""He is not being charged by a judge at the moment -- it is all at a police level,"" she said. Of the scores of people injured in the crash, 95 remained hospitalized Thursday, officials said. Thirty-two adults were in critical condition. Most of the deaths happened at the scene, Rios said. In Spain, judges typically record deaths that take place outside of hospitals. Judicial teams are still at the crash site and expect to find more bodies, she told CNN on Thursday morning. Interim charge d'affaires Luis G. Moreno at the embassy said it was in touch ""with families of some injured American citizens."" ""We are deeply shocked by the news of last night's train crash in Galicia. Our hearts and prayers are with the friends and families of the victims,"" he said Thursday. UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said one British citizen was injured. The crash came on the eve of a public holiday held to mark the region's saint's day. Local officials canceled festivities planned for Wednesday night and Thursday across Galicia. Train's speed questioned . The state railway, Renfe, said the train crashed on a curve several kilometers from the train station in the city of Santiago de Compostela, a popular tourist destination. The train was nearing the end of a six-hour trip from Madrid to the town of Ferrol in northwest Spain when it derailed at 8:41 p.m. Wednesday, the railway said. It was unclear how fast the train was traveling when it crashed. It was capable of going up to 250 kilometers per hour (155 mph), said Julio Hermida, a spokesman for the state railway. The driver, who suffered minor injuries, told police the train had entered the bend too fast, TVE reported. The driver has worked for the company for the last 30 years, a spokesman for the railway confirmed to CNN. In 2000, the driver started working as a train driver assistant, and in 2003 began working as a train driver, a job the driver has held since. Rafael Catala, secretary of state for transport and housing, told Spanish radio network Cadena SER that the ""tragedy appears to be linked to the train going too fast,"" but that the reasons for that are not yet known. Spanish news agency Efe and national daily El Pais cited sources within the investigation as saying that the driver had said the train was going at about 190 kilometers per hour, and that the limit on that curve was 80 kilometers per hour (50 mph.) The president of Renfe, Julio Gomez-Pomar, told radio station COPE on Thursday that the train had undergone a routine inspection that same morning. ""The train did not have an operating problem,"" he said. ""The maintenance and control record of the train was perfect."" Mourning declared . Spain's King Juan Carlos visited a hospital in Santiago de Compostela where victims injured in Wednesday's train accident are recovering. ""All Spaniards, we are united at this time. ... Really all Spaniards join in the pain of the families of the dead,"" he said. ""We hope that the wounded will recover, little by little."" The royal family canceled all events scheduled for the day out of respect for the day of mourning, the royal household told CNN. Alberto Nunez Feijoo, head of the regional government in Galicia, declared seven days of mourning in the region for victims of the tragedy. In a speech, he said ""all of the community cries about the tragedy that we are living, we cry for the victims, we cry for the unease and sadness of the families."" Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy viewed the scene of devastation Thursday morning and visited some of the hospitalized crash victims. Rajoy, who is from the area, told a news conference there was a ""huge challenge"" ahead, not least in identifying all those killed and informing their families, and he praised the response of everyone who has helped after the crash. Two investigations are under way, he said, adding, ""We want to establish what happened."" Rajoy declared three days of national mourning to honor the victims of the crash. The prime minister came under fire in Spanish media after a condolences message for the train crash victims posted by his office late Wednesday included a paragraph apparently ""copied and pasted"" from a statement previously sent to victims of an earthquake in Gansu, China. ''I would like to express my deepest condolences for the loss of human lives and the material damage from the earthquake that has occurred in Gansu has caused,"" the note said. Victim: 'Everything went dark' One victim, speaking from a hospital bed with his arm in a sling, told CNN affiliate Atlas that it seemed like train was going fast. ""But we didn't know what was the maximum speed, so I thought it was normal,"" he said, ""And suddenly there was a curve, the suitcases fell, and everything went dark. And I hit my head a ton of times, and 10 seconds later I was wedged between seats, and I had people's legs on top of me."" As he waited for rescuers to pull him from the wreckage, he heard other passengers yelling. ""I heard little children screaming. ... I also heard two girls that yelled out, one supporting the other,"" he said. Through the darkness, passenger Stephen Ward saw a little circle of light -- the door of the train. Rescuers came through it and helped the 18-year-old from Bountiful, Utah, get out. He waited for hours while victims with more serious injuries were taken to the hospital. As he watched rescue crews carry the dead and wounded, he cried and sang church hymns to calm himself down. A photo taken at the scene shows him leaning on a police officer as he walked beside the tracks, with blood oozing down his face and splattered on his crisp, white shirt. The Mormon missionary walked past dead bodies on the ground. He told London's Daily Telegraph that it looked like a scene from hell. U.S. citizen among those killed . When the train crashed, Ana-Maria Cordoba was on the way with her husband and their daughter to visit her son, who had been on a pilgrimage in Spain, the Catholic Diocese of Arlington told CNN. Cordoba, who worked for the diocese, was killed, spokesman Michael Donahue said. Her husband and daughter are hospitalized in stable condition, the diocese said. Crash investigation . Investigators are looking at all possible causes of the crash, a senior aide to the prime minister said Wednesday. Are you there and safe? Tell us what's happening . Renfe's spokesman said he did not know how many crew members were aboard the train when it crashed. Normally, there would be at least five crew members on a train like that, he said. Officials appealed for blood donations just after the crash but on Thursday said the short-term needs were met. Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council, expressed condolences from the European Union. Pope Francis, who is on a visit to Brazil for World Youth Day, sent a telegram to the bishop of Santiago de Compostela, Julian Barrio Barrio, offering his support and prayers for all those affected by the tragedy. CNN's Al Goodman reported from Santiago de Compostela and Laura Perez Maestro from Galicia. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London. CNN's Jonathan Helman, Catherine E. Shoichet, Elwyn Lopez, Patrick Sung, Eric Marrapodi, Jill Dougherty, Nelson Quinones, Marysabel Huston-Crespo, Mariano Castillo, and David Valenzuela contributed to this report.","NEW: Survivor says the crash site looked like a scene from hell .

"The father of a man accused of plotting terror attacks in New York says the charges against his son don't add up. ""It is an accusation that does not seem very true, because my son was never involved in any terrorist acts,"" father Juan Jose Pimentel, 51, told CNN en Español Tuesday. ""My son is not capable of something like that."" Pimentel, who lives in the Dominican Republic, said his son -- 27-year-old Jose Pimentel -- had been depressed for the past two years, ever since he and his wife separated.  Juan Jose Pimentel spoke to CNN en Español by phone and also in his hometown of La Vega. ""He had his son and she took his son and he was depressed because of this. But he has been a happy and normal boy and never had any problem with terrorism,"" Juan Jose Pimentel said. Authorities described Jose Pimentel as a ""lone wolf"" who was inspired by al Qaeda propaganda to plot attacks against police officers, patrol cars and troops returning from military service abroad. Juan Jose Pimentel said his son converted to Islam five years ago, but never appeared to be an extremist. ""He followed this religion but he was never a fanatic. He led a normal life, including coming to this country,"" Juan Jose Pimentel said. ""He didn't change. He continued to be a normal person."" Authorities arraigned Jose Pimentel Sunday night in a New York court on state charges of possession of a bomb for terrorism, conspiracy as a crime of terrorism, soliciting support for a terrorist act, being a felon in possession of a weapon and conspiracy to commit criminal mischief and arson, according to a criminal complaint. He allegedly told police he was an hour away from completing his first bomb when he was arrested, according to the complaint. ""Pimentel's behavior morphed from simply talking about such acts to actions -- namely, bomb making,"" New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly told reporters. Kelly said Jose Pimentel was a follower of Anwar al-Awlaki, the radical U.S.-born cleric who rose to become a top figure in al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula before a U.S. drone strike killed him this year in Yemen. In August, the suspect allegedly decided to carry out the bomb plot, Kelly said. He ""jacked up his speed"" after al-Awlaki died on September 30, according to the police commissioner. Jose Pimentel, also known as Muhammad Yusuf, according to the criminal complaint, had a ""very active and very public online profile,"" prosecutors said. They cited the website TrueIslam1. Jose Pimentel's attorney, Joseph Zablocki, said Monday that the case against his client is nowhere near as strong as authorities say. ""As they admit, he has a very public online profile, and that flies in the face of everything that they've said,"" Zablocki said at the hearing. ""This is not the way you go about committing terrorist attacks.""","Juan Jose Pimentel says his son wasn't involved in terrorism .

"(CNN)Well, there's one thing we can be sure of when the Oscar nominations are announced Thursday morning: Adam Sandler's ""Blended"" won't get any love. Other than that, the battle for nominations is pretty wide open. (Yes, even ""Transformers 4: Let's Destroy the Earth Again Really Loudly"" will probably pick up a nod in a technical category.) It's a strange year for the Academy Awards, where the divide between blockbusters and critic-friendly movies continues to grow. Of all the likely major-category nominees, only ""Gone Girl"" and ""Into the Woods"" were $100 million-level box-office hits. The films that have dominated awards season -- ""Boyhood,"" ""Birdman,"" ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" and ""The Theory of Everything"" -- have remained unseen by the majority of moviegoers. Still, the Oscars are as much a useful promotional exercise for little-seen films as they are a celebration of the booming blockbuster. (The actual Oscars show is February 22.) With that in mind, here are our thoughts on who will make the final cut in the six major categories. Best picture . Locks: ""Boyhood,"" a coming-of-age story filmed over 12 years, and ""Birdman,"" about a faded movie star mounting a Broadway comeback and shot as if in one long continuous take, have drawn near-universal raves for their audacious filmmaking. ""Selma"" infuses a pivotal historical moment with fresh urgency. Count on nods also for two well-made British period dramas, ""The Imitation Game"" and ""The Theory of Everything."" (Under the Academy's confusing voting system, there can be between five and 10 best picture nominees, unlike the other categories. Count on nods for eight or nine films.) Contenders: The Golden Globes' love for Wes Anderson's ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" makes it a likely nominee. David Fincher's ""Gone Girl"" has been a critical and commercial smash. ""Foxcatcher,"" based on a tragic true story, is respected but may be too downbeat for Academy voters. That leaves an opening for ""Whiplash,"" the riveting indie drama about a music student falling under the spell of an abusive mentor. Wild cards: Clint Eastwood's topical ""American Sniper,"" just hitting theaters this week, is gaining momentum. Few people have seen J.C. Chandor's crime drama ""A Most Violent Year,"" but it's getting strong reviews. Then again, the Academy may want to lighten things up by honoring the star-studded Sondheim musical ""Into the Woods."" Best actor . Locks: Michael Keaton, in a career-defining role, will earn his first-ever nomination for ""Birdman."" He'll be joined by three actors who brilliantly channeled real-life historical figures: Eddie Redmayne as disabled physicist Stephen Hawking in ""The Theory of Everything,"" David Oyelowo as a flesh-and-blood Martin Luther King Jr. in ""Selma"" and Benedict Cumberbatch as Alan Turing, the closeted World War II codebreaker in ""The Imitation Game."" Contenders: In the creepy-role acting sweepstakes, Jake Gyllenhaal's bloodthirsty TV cameraman from ""Nightcrawler"" may have the edge over Steve Carell's homicidal millionaire in ""Foxcatcher."" But voters may prefer the surprisingly nimble comic skills of Ralph Fiennes, whose resourceful concierge held ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" together. Wild cards: Bradley Cooper bulked up to play a lethal but conflicted soldier in ""American Sniper."" And don't forget Timothy Spall, who won best actor at Cannes for his performance as the titular British painter in ""Mr. Turner."" Best actress . Locks: ""Still Alice"" has barely opened, and reviews have been mixed, but Julianne Moore, who plays a woman with early-onset Alzheimer's, has been leading handicappers' surveys since it screened at the Toronto film festival. Reese Witherspoon, who holds ""Wild"" together, is also a sure bet. Contenders: Despite what Maggie Gyllenhaal said at the Golden Globes, rich leading roles for women are hard to come by in movies, which makes this category harder to fill than best actor. Relative newcomer Rosamund Pike will probably get in for playing the shifty wife in ""Gone Girl."" Amy Adams got a boost from her Golden Globe for ""Big Eyes."" Felicity Jones seems to be on everybody's shortlist for ""The Theory of Everything."" And Emily Blunt is earning good reviews for ""Into the Woods."" Wild cards: Previous Oscar winner Marion Cotillard was brilliant in two movies: ""The Immigrant"" and ""Two Days, One Night."" She may pick up a nomination for the latter. ""The Homesman"" earned respectful reviews, and two-time Oscar winner Hilary Swank was singled out in many of them. Jennifer Aniston has been playing the publicity game -- and earning raves -- for ""Cake."" And what about Gugu Mbatha-Raw? The British actress was great in ""Belle"" and ""Beyond the Lights."" Best supporting actor . Locks: We can start with J.K. Simmons, who was given a terrific part as a brutal music instructor in ""Whiplash"" and played it to the hilt. We can also probably end with him, since he's the odds-on favorite to win. Contenders: But the category has to be filled out with five nominees, so for starters, look for Edward Norton as a pompous actor who goes head to head with Michael Keaton in ""Birdman"" and Ethan Hawke as the good-hearted but sometimes absent father in ""Boyhood."" Other possibilities are Mark Ruffalo, one of the wrestling brothers in ""Foxcatcher,"" and Robert Duvall, who's been the only actor noticed in ""The Judge."" Wild cards: ""Inherent Vice"" received mixed reviews, but Josh Brolin's ramrod-straight cop got plenty of praise. Albert Brooks continues his good work as a character actor in ""A Most Violent Year."" And for a real left-field pick, how about Tyler Perry as a slick lawyer in ""Gone Girl""? Sure, he may not have known who David Fincher was, but he did a splendid job under Fincher's direction. Maybe he even picked up a few directing tips. Best supporting actress . Locks: Patricia Arquette has earned much praise, and a Golden Globe, for her struggling but empathetic mom in ""Boyhood."" Emma Stone made a strong impression as Keaton's bitter daughter in ""Birdman."" Meryl Streep will probably earn her annual nomination (her 19th!) for a showy role as ""Into the Woods' "" singing witch. Contenders: Keira Knightley ably crashed the all-male codebreakers' club in ""The Imitation Game,"" while Laura Dern was deeply affecting as Reese Witherspoon's dying mom in ""Wild."" Wild cards: Voters may want to reward Jessica Chastain for her ruthless wife in ""A Most Violent Year"" (and, indirectly, for ""Interstellar""). Rene Russo was superb as a desperate TV news producer in ""Nightcrawler."" And the always-memorable Tilda Swinton has support for her fascist-on-a-train role in the overlooked ""Snowpiercer."" Best director . Locks: Richard Linklater pioneered a new method of feature filmmaking with ""Boyhood,"" and the gamble paid off. Alejandro Gonzalez-Inarritu brought a bravura style to ""Birdman."" Contenders: This may finally be the year that quirky formalist Anderson (""The Grand Budapest Hotel"") gets in. The film won the Golden Globe for comedy/musical, and he picked up a Directors Guild nomination -- a key indicator, given that Oscar nominations are voted on by peers. Ava DuVernay has been the driving force behind ""Selma"" and would be the first African-American woman in this category. And Morten Tyldum directed ""The Imitation Game,"" the kind of upright, British-flavored movie the Academy loves ... even though Tyldum is Norwegian. Wild cards: Eastwood earned a DGA nod for ""American Sniper,"" and he's beloved by peers. Two youngsters, J.C. Chandor (""A Most Violent Year"") and newcomer Damian Chazelle (""Whiplash""), could find support. And then there's 84-year-old Jean-Luc Godard, the ornery French New Wave pioneer who's never received a competitive Oscar nomination (he did get an honorary Oscar in 2011). His film ""Goodbye to Language"" was hailed at Cannes, although Godard, being Godard, might just set his Oscar nomination certificate aflame.","The Oscar nominations will be announced about 8:30 a.m. Thursday .

"(Parenting.com) -- Germs. The word alone can put a room of new or expecting moms on high alert. After all, those pesky little microbes can be a big worry for parents trying to safeguard their tiny babies from sniffles, runny noses, fevers and worse. But not all germs (bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites) cause disease. In fact, all of us have a bouquet of normal bacteria on our skin, in our mouths and in our bellies that help us stay healthy (sounds gross, but it's true). They aid with digestion and building immunities, and, believe it or not, keeping them is as important as avoiding their disease-causing germ cousins. The story of the germ is one of good versus bad, and the happy ending results from finding a balance in the approach to both. Despite Herculean efforts to keep baby's environment clean, germs happen. Most infants will have between six and eight respiratory infections (colds, ear infections, bronchitis) each year. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) doesn't think a child's environment can be ""too clean,"" so do the best you can to police your collective space. Babe in the icky, dirty woods  Tips to keep your newborn germ-free . Since newborns have immature immune systems, every effort should be made to minimize their contact with bacteria and viruses that cause diseases. The big bad wolf has many friends, including respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, rotavirus, pertussis (whooping cough) and group B streptococcus. Even though it is impossible to completely control a newborn's environment, there are a few things that parents can do to limit a new baby's exposure without making themselves nutty in the process. 8 Adorable Ways Your Baby Says I Love You . Hold all calls . Tell Aunt Sally with the runny nose to stay away! It's important to keep a young infant from anyone with symptoms of infection: fevers, sore throats, coughs, sniffles and sneezes. Remind excited relatives and friends that the gift of keeping their germs to themselves trumps any teddy bear or romper set. Clean team . Wash your hands. A 20-second scrub with warm water and soap is the best prevention of spreading germs. It's also the single most important thing a person caring for a newborn can do. So, scrub your hands every time before scooping up your little one; ask others to always do the same. It's especially important whenever you've handled raw vegetables or meat, played with your pet, visited the bathroom or shaken someone's hand. 10 Reasons Play Makes Babies Smarter . Smooch-free zone . We know, your baby is just so darn kissable. But for the love of germ prevention, keep the smooches away from her face. Saliva and mucus are two hotbeds for germs, and avoiding big wet ones on the cheek is another defense in protecting her health. House arrest . Avoid grocery stores, restaurants, malls, festivals and other large crowds for the first few weeks. Bypassing the adoring, baby-loving masses and their host of pathogens will help keep your little one sniffle-free. Everything parents need to know about immunizations . Open mouth, insert germs  The truth about toys, pets and play groups . By the time baby's immune system has strengthened (with the help of recommended vaccines) your kid has discovered his mouth. Sadly, baby's cravings for mommy's keys don't disappear quickly. In fact, putting things, including his soiled hands, in his mouth will continue into toddlerhood and is a normal way for baby to explore and learn about his world. However, it's best to keep your little one from tasting too many dirty doodads, especially when they've previously hit the pavement, another child's mouth or Fido's doghouse. We know this isn't easy, especially since baby's world has grown to include playgrounds, play dates and trips to grocery stores, banks and other germy wonderlands. So keep these guidelines in mind to help minimize the guesswork and baby's overall germ exposure. 10 Mom-Tested Hand-Washing Tricks . Wash up!  At about 8 to 12 months, teach your tot how to wash his hands. Regular soap and water does the trick (antibacterial types have not proven more effective). Get in the habit of washing baby's hands before he eats (including snacks) and after diaper changes, visits to the playground, petting an animal or coughing, sneezing or wiping his nose. If soap and water are not available, alcohol-based gels or wipes will suffice. The trouble with toys  To clean or not to clean? Most of the time, washing toys with soap and water and letting them air-dry every couple weeks is fine. But when there is a gaggle of kids manhandling baby's toys (or a play date with another drooly baby), the risk for bacteria rises. These times call for a regular household bleach wash (one-quarter cup of household bleach to one gallon of water or one tablespoon of household bleach to one quart of water). Wash, rinse thoroughly and air-dry the goods. Fuzzy toys are germ magnets and are harder to clean, so you might want to put these away during the next play date. Et tu, fido? The AAP does not recommend pets for families with children under the age of 5 because of germs and a child's immature judgment. But if Rover or Mimi are already members of your crew, make sure their areas and toys are separate from where baby plays. (Since reptiles and snakes frequently have salmonella, it's best they not be anywhere near children.) Shot in the arm (or leg)  Vaccinations are not just important for baby. Make sure both parents and caregivers are up-to-date on their immunizations as well. Most important are the influenza vaccine, which everyone older than 6 months should receive each fall, and the Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis) vaccine, which is given to adults as a booster every 10 years. Consult your physician about when you're due. Why Kids Get Sicker at Night . Make-it-fun tip! Sing the alphabet song while you help baby wash his hands. The song is just long enough to get his tiny mitts squeaky clean. Germ-O-Meter  The dirtiest places in a baby's world (From least to most) * Bed linens . * Bathtubs . * Shopping cart handles . * Playgrounds . * Carpets . * Kitchen Sink . Germ magnet . Disinfect bath toys frequently or avoid buying ones that collect water and breed mold and bacteria. The five-second rule is a myth Bacteria and salmonella can live up to a month on surfaces, and it takes less than five seconds for them to adhere to that juicy piece of peach that fell on the floor. So, sorry to say, it's time to put the peach, and the five-second rule, in the trash. Get 2 FREE YEARS of Parenting magazine - Subscribe Now!! Copyright 2011 The Parenting Group. All rights reserved.

"A Guam-bound United Airlines flight that was forced to land on remote Midway Island after pilots detected an electrical odor experienced a mechanical problem, the carrier said Monday.

"U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder is worried about wholes that are greater than the sum of their parts. Take, for instance, the current mix of bomb-makers from Yemen with foreign fighters in Syria. ""That's a deadly combination, where you have people who have the technical know-how along with the people who have this kind of fervor to give their lives in support of a cause that is directed at the United States and directed at its allies. And it's something that gives us really extreme, extreme concern,"" he told ABC's ""This Week."" He estimated there are about 7,000 foreign fighters in Syria, coming from places like Europe and the United States. ""In some ways, it's more frightening than anything I think I've seen as attorney general,"" he said. ""This is a situation that we can see developing and the potential that I see coming up, the negative potential I see coming out of the facts in Syria and Iraq now, are quite concerning,"" he said. Since it started in 2011, the conflict in Syria has left more than 150,00 dead and some 680,000 injured. Then there's the humanitarian crisis for the survivors, with the United Nations estimating that more than 9.3 million need help and that at least 6.5 million have been forced from their homes into other parts of Syria. Another 2.5 million are now refugees in neighboring countries. And threats from that part of the world aren't the only ones Holder has to worry about. He also fears potential attacks on planes. This month, the Transportation Security Administration said that security screeners at overseas airports may ask U.S.-bound passengers to turn on their electronic devices to prove they work and aren't explosive devices. They won't allow devices without power on board planes. The traveler may then undergo additional screening. It's part of an update to security measures aimed at combating potential new threats from terrorists in the Middle East and Europe. ""This is not a test ... We're doing something in reaction to things that we have detected,"" Holder told ABC about the upgrades. ""We are at a dangerous time,"" he said.

"(CNN)I suppose we should have seen it coming, really. Back in the fall, when Romneyworld was buzzing about another candidacy, the storyline was this: It's in the realm of the ""truly hypothetical,"" I was told, with a strong suggestion that Mitt Romney would only run as part of a late-entrant party-savior scenario. ""A lot of people ...are rooting for him to get in,"" said one inside source. ""Romney's not one of them."" Well, I guess he is now. What a difference a few months makes. Now, multiple sources inside the Romney bubble tell me (and everyone else) that they ""bet"" that he gets in the race. And we will know something within ""the next few weeks."" He had a great midterm election, they point out. (As in: he campaigned like crazy for candidates who won in red states that Romney had won.) He believes that he was right on foreign policy positions that he was ""mocked"" for during the 2012 campaign. (As in: Russia is our ""No.1 geopolitical foe."") Oh, and by the way, he still thinks he can manage the economy better than anyone out there. But, almost to a person, those close to Romney also say this: don't get too analytical about this new decision. One source close to Romney, who has spoken with him about this calculation, puts it this way: ""This is about the burning ambition of a guy who believes he would be a great president. He believes he is the right guy for the job. Period. It's not complicated."" Which brings us to the rationale for the rest of the ever-expanding field, which is also not complicated: why not run? It's not very often that you have the conjunction of two key situations -- an open Oval Office and a party without an obvious frontrunner. The GOP establishment has not coalesced around New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, as some thought might happen. Jeb Bush, another somewhat unexpected contender, has never run in a presidential primary. The tea party has a gaggle of candidates to choose from, and hasn't settled, either. So, from a cost-benefit standpoint, there's no downside for those entering the presidential sweepstakes for the first time. Let's say you know you probably won't win, but -- looking back at the last campaign -- you'll probably get your 15 minutes of fame. (Can you say Herman Cain?) It's a good way to elevate yourself if you bring anything at all to the table.  And even if you don't, it's still a good platform from which you can increase your speech fees, board availabilities and TV appearances. So get behind that podium, asap. Romney, of course, is in a different category: he has more to lose. He's a man who lost in 2012 with grace and carried on in the same manner. He was indefatigable during the midterms. Here's the rub: Once you have been a party's nominee, and you vie again, you need to do well. Looking back into semi-recent history, Richard Nixon stands out as a winner on that level, nominated in 1960, nominated again by Republicans and winning in 1968.  Democratic nominee Adlai Stevenson, the other hand, not so much. He ran against Dwight Eisenhower and lost in 1952 and lost again in 1956. Generally, one-time presidential nominees who lose tend to decide they're not up for the thrill of it all again. And while Romney allies swear this decision isn't about the qualifications of the rest of the field, he clearly hasn't looked around and found a candidate he thinks is as good as he is. ""He's not motivated by some sense of entitled ambition,"" says a Romney ally. ""It's just that Romney looks at the field and believes he has a lot to offer. And we think experience is an advantage."" Translation: These other guys have no idea what they're in for, and I do. A favorite analogy of Romney supporters is the Super Bowl. ""It makes a big difference to have been there before,"" says one adviser. Another finds the analogy helpful when referring to Jeb's now-famous declaration (and Romney jab) that the GOP nominee needs to be willing to ""lose the primary to win the general"" to keep principles intact. ""The process is the process,"" this Romney supporter says. ""You can't show up at the Super Bowl and say 'I wish it was an 80-yard field.'"" In other words, Jeb, you have to win the primaries in order to win the nomination. Underlying all of this are two Romney presumptions. First, that he would be a better candidate. And next, that he would run a better campaign. That remains to be seen. But here's what is already obvious: Republicans see Hillary Clinton as probably inevitable as the Democratic nominee and completely gettable as their opponent. They believe the Democrats can't duplicate the Obama coalition without Obama. They understand the gender gap will grow, but they figure Clinton's liabilities will grow, too -- as a candidate and as a former secretary of state. ""Romney was a poor candidate up against a machine and he got 47% of the vote,"" says a Democratic strategist. ""I don't blame them for thinking they can win."" Romney could not have said it better himself.","Gloria Borger: Romney seemed uninterested months ago, but now he's looking at it seriously .
He likes his chances in the very crowded GOP presidential field ."
"(CNN) -- Fighting flared in Yemen's volatile southern region Thursday, as security forces battled armed Islamic militants in one town and reports surfaced of arrests and deaths in two other cities. Fighting erupted for six hours Wednesday in Hawta, the capital of Lahj province, when armed Islamic militants attacked government compounds, according to a security official who asked not to be named because he's not authorized to speak to the media. Three people died and at least 12 people were wounded in the clashes Wednesday, the official said. The fierce fighting between security personnel and insurgents resumed Thursday, witnesses said. Yemeni state TV also reported unrest in the southern towns of Zinjibar and Aden. It said al Qaeda militants in Zinjibar killed two residents and injured another in a mortar attack, and it reported the arrests of 10 al Qaeda members and five other people for firing at civilians and ransacking stores in Aden's Mansoura area. The security official and witnesses provided more detail to CNN about the fighting in Hawta. Armed militants took over security offices and fired rocket-propelled grenades at the central bank branch office and the compound of the judiciary on Wednesday, the official said. Terrified eyewitnesses and residents said they were ordered by the militants to stay indoors, and shops were forced to shut down. ""The gunmen were in control quickly and government forces did not fight back in most cases,"" said Abdul Sattar Ali, a store owner in the province. ""The gunmen occupied the buildings quickly."" Impoverished Yemen has been wracked with tension in recent months. Anti-government demonstrations have engulfed the country, and protesters are demanding that President Ali Abdullah Saleh leave office. Saleh was wounded nearly two weeks ago when the presidential compound was attacked, and he is recovering at a hospital in neighboring Saudi Arabia. Government forces have been locked in conflict with al Qaeda's Yemen wing, and authorities fear that the group, called al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, is exploiting the country's political instability. It has a strong presence in southern Yemen. AQAP has been labeled as a foreign terrorist organization by the United States. The growing unrest has affected U.S. training operations aimed at helping combat AQAP in Yemen, U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen told reporters Thursday. ""I worry a great deal about its continuing to grow and become more violent over time,"" he said. ""I certainly would say that (the unrest) has gotten in the way of the training. ... The Yemeni forces are very focused on their own country right now."" On Thursday, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton classified AQAP operative Othman al-Ghamdi as a ""specially designated global terrorist"" under an executive order that ""targets terrorists and those providing support to terrorists or acts of terrorism."" It is the department's seventh listing of an AQAP member. A senior administration official told CNN that Ghamdi was released from the Guantanamo detention facility in 2006 and had been one of well over 100 detainees the Bush administration sent to Saudi Arabia. Al-Ghamdi ""has been involved in raising funds for the organization's operations and activities in Yemen"" and has ""worked with other AQAP members to plan and stockpile weapons for future attacks,"" the State Department said in a news release. He appeared in a video alongside Fahd al-Quso, an AQAP operative wanted for his role in the USS Cole bombing in October 2000, the department said. Ghamdi was identified publicly as AQAP's operational commander in the video, released in May 2010, . The State Department said a U.N. panel has taken similar action against al-Ghamdi. CNN's Jill Dougherty contributed to this report .","NEW:  Adm. Mike Mullen says unrest in Yemen has affected U.S. training efforts there .

"(CNN)Durban's beachfront promenade was whipped by thin sheets of rain as Stan Engelbrecht and Nic Grobler sat at a seaside café to have breakfast. Coffee was in order. The two photographers were still trying to shake off their morning tiredness, having just arrived at the coastal city after cycling some 1,600 kilometers from Kimberley, a town at the heart of South Africa. ""Just as the coffee arrived, I saw this guy fly by with no shirt on, riding this strange-looking bike,"" recalls Engelbrecht. ""Nic and I just looked at each other and it was like, 'we've got to get this guy!' Nic just said 'go, go, go,' so I jumped on my bike and started chasing him in the rain."" It took more than seven kilometers and several screams before Engelbrecht finally managed to catch up with the shirtless rider -- named Brandan Searle -- and talk to him. ""He stopped and allowed me to get his photograph and do a quick interview with him,"" says Engelbrecht. ""He was on his way to work -- he works as a gym instructor -- but he told me an amazing story; he'd been traveling the world with that exact bike."" That story and photograph can be found in ""Bicycle Portraits,"" an image-led three-book series by Engelbrecht and Grobler documenting South Africa's bicycle commuter culture. Starting in 2010, the two friends and bike enthusiasts were keen to explore who cycles in the country and how their bicycles fit into their daily life. ""We decided just to get on our bikes and cycle around and see who we would meet,"" says Engelbrecht. ""It happened organically,"" adds Grobler, 34. ""We didn't set out with a strict plan of what we wanted to do...We were thinking maybe we'll be working on it for six months."" Read this: Cape Town draped in color for 'slave' carnival . Instead, Grobler and Engelbrecht ended up spending over three years on the project, cycling thousands of kilometers across South Africa -- from big urban centers, through steep hills and mountains, to small towns and rural areas. Along their journeys, they'd speak to, photograph and sometimes even ride together with the cyclists they'd meet on the road, people who used their bikes not for recreation but as an everyday way of transport -- everyone from die-hard commuters to people making a living from their makeshift bicycles. Engelbrecht and Grobler say these ""brave"" and ""inspirational"" individuals, are defying dangerous roads and social prejudices by making the everyday decision to use bicycles to get around. ""In South Africa there's no culture of commuting by bicycle,"" says Engelbrecht. ""Some of the friends that we made were really colorful and interesting people, very eccentric I would say,"" he adds. ""It's really an alternative choice to ride a bicycle -- it's often a choice that comes out of necessity because of the rising costs of transport and in fact people have to travel long distances to get to work. Often people live in townships and they work in the cities where it's actually very far from their home."" Grobler and Engelbrecht, who turned to crowdsourcing website Kickstarter to fund their project, say that riding a bicycle themselves helped them create an instant bond with the cyclists they'd encounter, allowing different people from all walks of life to open up to them and have a friendly discussion. ""There is a pride around having and using a bicycle, especially because in South Africa it's not being used as much for commuting,"" says Grobler. ""It kind of felt like you get a different holistic image of the country, after hanging out one on one with everyday people,"" he adds. ""A very different image of the country, of the situation and the state of racial interactions and political interactions ... than you get from, say, reading the newspaper or always being aware of the extremes."" The photographic project was published in December 2012, yet that didn't signal the end of Grobler and Engelbracht's journey. Since then, they have been on their bikes again, cycling back to meet the people featured in the books in order to give them a copy. ""It was a very natural thing to do,"" explains Grobler. ""We never felt that the right thing was to pay anybody for their time or taking their photo -- that'd be kind of compromising the integrity of it,"" he adds. ""As far as our project goes, it's probably the best part of the experience."" Engelbrecht agrees. ""It's very rewarding being able to go back to someone and say, 'remember I met you two years ago, I took your photo and this is what I did with it,'"" he says. The two photographers have so far gone back to about 70% of the people they'd photographed and are still planning to visit the remainder 30%. ""People's reactions are always very positive,"" says Engelbrecht. ""They feel very proud, they really love it, it's a nice feeling to make someone feel so proud and also ... when you're able to give them a copy of the book, they can see themselves amongst other South Africans that have a similar interest to them. And also the stories -- you can read a lot about other people's personal history and culture and socioeconomic background, it's just very interesting for these people.""

"(CNN) -- According to the Obama administration, the fact that Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab boarded a plane for the United States with potentially exploding underwear was caused by a systemic failure in intelligence. That's true. In the same way that an auto accident is caused by two cars crashing together. Saying the system failed is merely describing what happened, and Obama's plan will do nothing to address the underlying problem. The real problem is what we need to be talking about, not just because it's at the core of our intelligence crisis, but because it's the same problem that broke our economy, made health care unaffordable and hobbled the U.S. auto industry. And unless the Obama Administration gets smart about dealing with this larger problem, and fast, our skies won't be safer any time soon. The problem is organizational culture. As Peter Drucker, the late father of modern management, said: ""Culture eats strategy for breakfast."" Culture says it's OK to not think creatively about how a lead might connect to other information. Culture says that following up on leads eventually is soon enough. Culture says that doing what's in our job description is ""good enough for government work."" Obama's plan to fix the intelligence system boils down to integrate the components, clarify roles and responsibilities, add additional steps to the screening process, invest in newer technology, deploy more air marshals and work cooperatively with other governments. None of these actions will do one thing to effect people's relationships with each other and with their work, which is the essence of culture. Let's be honest. When we go through a Transportation Security Administration line in the United States, we're not blown away by organizational brilliance. We see people plodding through the same steps, in the same way, often doing the minimum to not get fired. (That's not to say that all TSA cultures are that bad; a few are quite effective.) Most people assume that the culture in the intelligence community is better. Actually, the odds are against it. In a study of 24,000 people published in 2008 in Tribal Leadership, John King, Halee-Fischer-Wright and I found that 25 percent of workplace cultures are as stupid as our worst TSA experiences. These groups express a ""my life stinks"" view and show almost no innovation, initiative or ownership -- precisely the behaviors necessary to reform our intelligence systems. Even more frightening, 48 percent of organizational cultures express the view that ""I'm great (and you're not)"". People in these workplaces rise to the challenge, but as individuals, not as groups. Star performers hoard information, work on outshining each other and act with the real goal of advancing themselves. They hoard information, build silos and erect walls between groups. So imagine these two cultures -- accounting for about three out of four workplaces --  responding to Obama's plan to reform the intelligence system. People in ""my life stinks"" cultures will react by rolling their eyes, making sarcastic jokes and looking at their watches. Nothing will change. People in ""I'm great"" cultures will respond that the problems are easily solved as long as everyone gets behind their plan. The problem is, everyone is advancing their own ideas, and ultimately, their own careers. (Sound like Congress?) As a consultant who logs almost as many miles as the George Clooney character in ""Up In The Air"" and a scholar of organizational performance, I've hoped that the Obama Administration's reaction would focus on the heart of the problem, that the agencies and organizations that we rely on have stupid workplace cultures. I'm not saying the people involved are stupid. I'm saying the culture makes people stupider than they really are. (And while we're on the subject, ""my life stinks"" is the dominant culture in the U.S. auto industry,  which is why it failed in the first place. And ""I'm great"" cultures run Wall Street, which is why greed went unchecked until it became pathological.) Until we target culture as the issue, all we're accomplishing with systemic fixes is the illusion of action. No amount of Obama-style fixes will make a stupid culture any smarter, and remember, culture eats strategy -- and systems -- for breakfast. In his press conference, President Obama said, ""Ultimately, the buck stops with me. When the system fails, it is my responsibility."" The question is: Why is no one taking responsibility for the cultures that produce these failures? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dave Logan.","""Systemic failure"" is not a real explanation of Christmas Day near attack, says Dave Logan .
He says patching the nation's security system is no substitute for a culture change .
He says intelligence agencies need a culture of initiative and ownership .
Logan: President Obama's fixes amount to the ""illusion of action"""
"(CNN)Before the virus ravaged West Africa, before the deaths soared into the thousands, before the outbreak triggered global fears, Ebola struck a toddler named Emile Ouamouno. Virtually no one knew the 2-year-old by name. Now the world knows him as patient zero. Researchers from The New England Journal of Medicine say they believe Emile was the first person to contract the disease in the current outbreak almost a year ago. It's not clear exactly how the boy, who lived in a rainforest village in southern Guinea, got infected. Ebola can be spread from animals to humans through infected fluids or tissue. ""In Africa, infection has been documented through the handling of infected chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines,"" according to the World Health Organization. Get up to speed . In December, Emile had a fever, black stool and started vomiting. Four days later, on December 6, he was dead. Within a month, so were his young sister, his mother and his grandmother. The mother suffered bleeding symptoms and died on December 13. Then, the toddler's 3-year-old sister died on December 29, with symptoms including fever, vomiting and black diarrhea. The grandmother passed away on January 1. Emile's father is left with only fond memories from when before Ebola ripped apart his life. ""Before my children Emile and Philomène died, they loved to play with a ball. My wife liked to carry the baby on her back,""  Etienne Ouamouno told UNICEF, the U.N. children's agency. The family lived in the village of Meliandou, where goats and chickens roam around simple brown huts. The village sits close to Guinea's borders with Sierra Leone and Liberia. It didn't take long for Ebola to spread like wildfire. Like dominoes . The illness spread outside their village after several people attended the grandmother's funeral. A midwife passed the disease to relatives in another village, and to a health care worker treating her, according to The New England Journal of Medicine. That health care worker was treated at a hospital in Macenta, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) east. A doctor who treated her contracted Ebola. The doctor then passed it to his brothers in Kissidougou, 133 kilometers (83 miles) away. All of them died. And now, the death toll has skyrocketed to almost 5,000 worldwide, including one in the United States. The hardest hit, however, are Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Lingering effects . In the four months after Emile's death, Meliandou buried 14 residents. The village is now free of Ebola, but the lingering effects there and elsewhere will last for years. The disease has turned the social fabric on its head. Extended family usually takes orphans in, but fear has broken the chain. ""We noticed that with this crisis, which is almost a humanitarian catastrophe, people flee their villages and abandon their families and their children,"" said Fassou Isidor Lama, a UNICEF child protection officer. ""They reject the infected children and the other infected family members."" Complete coverage of Ebola . Then there's the financial toll. In Meliandou, many of the villagers earned their livelihood selling rice, corn or bananas to nearby towns and cities. ""Nobody wants to buy our products,"" Amadou Kamano, the village chief, told UNICEF. Residents, out of fear, also burned their mattresses and other possessions. ""People burned everything,"" Kamano said. ""Now we are even poorer than we were before."" CNN's Madison Park and Lynda Kinkade contributed to this report.","Researchers believe 2-year-old Emile Ouamouno was patient zero .

"Italian football club Lazio must play their opening home game of the season with a section of their fans banned from the match as punishment for racial abuse. Organisers of Italy's top-flight championship Serie A said in a statement that it had found Lazio fans guilty of ""shouts and chants expressive of racial discrimination against three players of the opposing team"" during the Italian Supercup final Sunday. The match, which was won 4-0 by defending Serie A champions Juventus, was held at Lazio's Olympic Stadium in Rome. League chiefs said Lazio supporters in the Curva Nord stand twice directed sustained abuse at the players involved in the traditional Serie A curtain raiser. As punishment, that section of the ground will now be closed for Lazio's match against Udinese on 25 August. France midfielder Paul Pogba was one of the Juventus players targeted by abuse by some of Lazio's more hardcore supporters. He told the French news agency AFP: ""What can I do? I'm alone against 30,000 fans. They do that even though there are blacks in their team. ""It's also a lack of respect towards their own players. ""It's really not nice to come to a football match and hear those sort of things but I'm a player, I concentrate on my job."" Italian football has been plagued by racist discrimination, with the sport's authorities struggling to eradicate the problem despite repeated efforts. In June the Italian Football Federation brought in new rules allowing referees to stop matches and warn fans about their behavior, while players and clubs could potentially face tougher sanctions. Last season Lazio fans were found guilty of racist behaviour by Uefa four times. Following Sunday's Supercup final, Juventus and Lazio were also both fined by 5,000 euros after fans lit flares in the stands.","Italian club Lazio forced to shut a section of their ground for opening Serie A match .

"(CNN) -- On a sunny day at the Rose Bowl Aquatics Center in Pasadena, California, in 1991, photographer Kirk Weddle was setting up to shoot what would become an iconic image in rock music. Spencer Elden was chosen from pictures of 12 babies to grace Nirvana?s ""Nevermind"" CD cover. Weddle's close friend, artist and designer Rick Elden, remembers that day well because he had brought his 4-month-old son to the pool for Weddle to shoot. Weddle had been tapped to create the cover for what would become Nirvana's breakthrough album ""Nevermind."" ""We went to the same college together,"" Elden said of his friendship with Weddle. ""We were tight buddies and we'd been through a lot together."" To hear Elden tell it, the shoot was just another job in a long string of photo shoots for musical acts during his association with Weddle. ""Keep in mind we shot the Temptations, and so many bands,"" he said. On the day of the Nirvana shoot, Weddle was said to be working on an idea dreamed up by the band's relatively unknown frontman, Kurt Cobain, Elden said. ""Rumor had it that Cobain had the original concept of wanting to show a mother giving birth under water,"" Elden said. ""but the compromise was to have a baby swimming under water. Or so that's what I was told."" A dozen infants including Elden's first-born son Spencer were signed up for the photo shoot in the pool that week. On that particular day only Spencer was scheduled to swim for Weddle. Read more about what Spencer Elden is doing now . The boy was in good hands, said Elden, a certified lifeguard. And even at 4 months, Spencer was a good swimmer, he said. However, ""if you don't pull them up, they will drown,"" he joked. ""There's tricks to it: You blow in the kid's face and it creates a gag reflex. Infants have a gag reflex, as we all do. You hold him up really close to your face. You blow into him really hard. They gasp, and into the water they go."" Weddle then shot just 18 frames, according to Elden. ""We only had a half a second"" before the shoot was over and little Spencer was plucked from the water. ""Boom, boom, boom. End of story,"" he said. ""We got paid $200."" Years later, Spencer Elden, now a 17-year-old high school graduate, returned to that same Pasadena pool complex to compete as a swimmer and water polo player on the club team. Read how Nirvana changed iReporters' lives . He said he's still a pretty good swimmer.

"(CNN) -- A bird struck an Arkansas hospital's helicopter Saturday, tearing a hole into the aircraft's nose and prompting the pilot to land early, according to officials and pictures taken after the landing. A medical helicopter landed near Forrest City, Arkansas, on Saturday after striking a bird. The chopper's pilot made a ""safe landing"" in that state after hitting a bird while returning to Baptist Health Center in Little Rock, Arkansas, hospital spokesman Mark Lowman said. ""I think the pilot just made a judgment call to set it down,"" Lowman said of the landing, which happened at 6:15 p.m. Saturday near Forrest City, Arkansas. Video footage taken by CNN affiliate WREG showed a bird hanging out of a hole torn into the paneling on the chopper's nose. Part of the helicopter's windshield also was broken. The pilot was slightly injured during the landing, and the other two crew members on board were uninjured, Lowman said. Federal aviation officials are investigating, and the helicopter is not expected to be grounded for long, he said. The helicopter was returning from a hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, where the crew had taken a patient. The incident came two days after a US Airways jetliner was forced to land in New York's Hudson River, apparently after striking a flock of birds. Shortly after the jet took off from New York's LaGuardia airport on Thursday, the crew reported seeing a flock of birds. Seconds later, the cockpit voice recorder captured the sounds of loud ""thumps"" and both of the plane's engines failed. The pilot, C.B. ""Sully"" Sullenberger, landed the Airbus A320 in the Hudson, where all 155 people aboard were rescued.","Bird hits Arkansas hospital's helicopter, forcing pilot to land early .

"The Italian broadcaster Rai recently aired a piece of nostalgia that would have brought a tear to the eye of many Serie A fans. It was a 1991 league game between AC Milan and Sampdoria. Onto the pitch at Milan's imposing San Siro stadium strode a galaxy of stars, with the likes of Ruud Gullit, Roberto Mancini, Marco Van Basten, Gianluca Vialli and Attilio Lombardo strutting their stuff. It was a glimpse back to a golden age. This was an era of almost fantasy football -- competitive, technical, flamboyant, creative -- and Italy basked in the knowledge that its top division was the envy of the world. Ironically it was Serie A, and the Italia 90 World Cup, that played a key role in the resurgence of England's now all-conquering Premier League. In 1991 English football was still grappling with the aftermath of the Heysel and Hillsborough disasters and many games were played in comparatively dilapidated stadiums under hooliganism's shadow. Serie A, with its foreign stars and newly-renovated arenas, presented a seductive model to follow. Fast forward 22 years and things appear to have changed completely. Serie A seems not only to have fallen behind the English Premier League and Spain's La Liga, but also Germany's Bundesliga and Italy's latest usurpers, France's Ligue 1. Drained of its international talent, plagued by corruption scandals and racism controversies, and struggling to update its creaking infrastructure, the once mighty Serie A looks a pale imitation of its former self. Historian John Foot, author of the authoritative ""Calcio, A History of Italian Football"", has observed the Italian game's descent from its 90s peak, and laments its self-inflicted decline. ""They had a golden goose in the 90s and they killed it, which is incredible really,"" Foot told CNN. Part of Serie A's financial malaise comes from the way the league's television rights have been sold. While the English Premier League's TV deals swelled its teams' coffers, Italy instead split the rights among individual clubs. ""The way the league has previously been packaged on television has been disastrous,"" says Foot, ""with clubs acting purely in their own interests."" Back in the early 90s, UK football fans, relatively starved of football on TV, consumed the freshly aired Italian football product with enthusiasm. The standard bearer for Serie A on British television was broadcaster James Richardson, who can see some signs of positive change in an Italian game that has long been in the doldrums. ""You can see progress"", he says, ""and there's definitely a sense that Serie A is moving forward; the problem is that it's moving fairly slowly."" Richardson's enthusiasm for the Italian game remains strong, but he points to the pace of change in other leagues as a cause for concern. ""You have to view Serie A's progress in context,"" he continued. ""The thing is that there has been an explosion of money in other leagues. ""The Premier League, the Bundesliga and now France have taken things to another level in that respect, so even though Serie A is improving too, the gap is actually widening. There are positives, but they're positives in a provincial sense."" He also points out Italy lost its fourth Champions League spot -- only three Italian clubs currently qualify for Europe's premier competition, though ironically Juventus earned the most revenue in last season's tournament, surpassing even winners Bayern Munich. ""That was a huge financial blow, and you can see its effect on the second tier of Serie A clubs,"" noted Richardson. Italy's ""Old Lady"" Interestingly, a beacon of hope for the league is actually the club that suffered most from the fall-out of 2006's Calciopoli scandal. Juve was heavily censured by the authorities at the time, but has since undergone a remarkable renaissance, culminating in the construction of an impressive new stadium -- the only club-owned facility in Serie A. That revival saw Juve reach the Champions Leauge quarterfinals and also become the first to go unbeaten in Serie A's new 38-game format. Foot says that the club, known in Italy as ""The Old Lady,"" has shown others the way forward. ""Juve's success, and their new stadium, has given others a model they can aspire to,"" he said. ""You have to give credit to the way they've turned things around -- they were in disarray (after 2006) but they've managed to build a new stadium and a very impressive new team in an incredibly short space of time."" Aside from its obvious commercial advantages, Richardson also believes the new stadium has helped Juve on the pitch. ""It has had a huge benefit in terms of revenue, but actually people overlook its impact on atmosphere,"" he said. ""That may well have had a positive effect on their performances on the pitch. Other clubs can really see that."" In fact, several are already taking steps to follow the Juve model, with Roma, Lazio and Sampdoria all tabling proposals for new stadiums, and Inter exploring the idea of moving away from the San Siro. Of course, this being Italy, these proposals are fraught with complexity. ""It is hard to get things done in Italy, especially in the big cities,"" explains Foot. ""You need the support of local government and it gets very complicated.  The problem is always local politics.  The new stadium proposals in Rome and Milan will be difficult to realize because of that.  I'm not sure I can see them happening any time soon. ""It may be easier in the smaller cities though, so perhaps in somewhere like Genoa (home of Sampdoria) there's a better chance."" Stamping out racism . The most public problem Serie A has faced in recent months has been the issue of racism, but to the credit of the league, it appears determined to stamp this out. Most recently, Lazio has seen its famous Curva Nord (the section of the stadium occupied by its hardcore Ultras) closed by the authorities. ""Shutting the Curva is a huge step,"" said Foot. ""These fans live for that, it's everything to them, so it's really hitting them where it hurts."" As this most beautiful and cultured of countries readies itself for a new football campaign, there are other indications that Serie A might finally be getting back on track to compete with Europe's big leagues. ""The stadiums, the fans, the racism issue -- all that needs sorting,"" adds Foot, ""but there are signs that is starting to happen. ""The crucial thing is the way the league is marketed; marketing Serie A as a package, which focuses on the whole league, not just the big teams, has to be the way to drive success."" The latest TV deal may not be as lucrative as that of England's Premier League, but it is at least far more equitable. ""Serie A has finally got its act together on TV rights,"" says Foot, ""and you can also see clubs like Napoli and Udinese investing their money wisely or making long-terms plans."" Indeed, Napoli have caught the eye this transfer window, and appear ready to put up a serious fight for the Scudetto, not least because of their military style new away kit. The departure of Edinson Cavani to Paris Saint-Germain has been offset with some interesting arrivals, particularly Gonzalo Higuain from Real Madrid, for whose signature Napoli resisted competition from Arsenal, and the experienced manager Rafael Benitez. The comparative lack of cash in the Italian game has had one positive knock-on effect, however -- the development of young players. ""There are so many technically gifted, very talented young Italian players in Serie A now,"" says Foot, ""which is the opposite to what's going on with English players in the Premier League. ""You can see the benefit of that in the Italian national side, which is very strong and will definitely be challenging for honors at the World Cup."" Italy also continues to be a production line for managers, with many -- such as Carlo Ancelotti and Gianfranco Zola -- plying their trade successfully outside Italy, but plenty more are coming through the ranks. ""They are always hugely knowledgeable about the game and highly technical"", says Foot. Richardson also points to a new more attacking outlook that has taken hold, consigning the cliche of defensive ""Catenaccio"" to history. ""There are managers in Serie A with much more attacking philosophies now,"" enthuses Richardson. ""Rudi Garcia (who has joined Roma from Lille) is another one in that mold.  There's also a commitment to good technical football and tactical excellence that marks the league out."" While many European leagues have become rather predictable, Serie A also appears to be regaining its competitive edge. In the 90s the Italian league boasted seven teams that would routinely challenge for the title, known as ""Le Sette Sorelle,"" or ""The Seven Sisters"" -- Milan, Inter, Juve, Roma, Lazio, Parma, and Fiorentina. Richardson can see the coming years being similarly open. ""We might not be quite back to those days yet,"" he says, ""but you can make a case that we're getting there -- with Napoli and Udinese perhaps replacing Lazio and Parma. ""That makes the league really open, and arguably a lot more exciting than say Spain, or even Germany."" As for this year's competition, Juve -- who have added Carlos Tevez and Fernando Llorente to their attacking armory -- are firm favorites, but other teams will certainly be interesting to watch. ""Inter may have a long hard season ahead of them; the new ownership there has pulled the handbrake on transfers at a time when they really need investment,"" says Richardson, "" but Napoli are very interesting, and there's a lot of potential at Milan. ""They have some good young players and the return of Nigel De Jong will help shore them up defensively. ""Fiorentina have a really talented and exciting midfield, and Mario Gomez is potentially a fantastic asset to add to that, not to mention the return of Giuseppe Rossi. Those two could make them pretty formidable going forward."" The days of Serie A sitting at the pinnacle of European football may be in the past, but it is clear that reports of its death have been exaggerated. With its mix of youth, new signings, unrivaled technical ability and the inevitable soap opera off the pitch, we could instead be in for a vintage season of Italian football.","Italy's Serie A kicks off on Saturday .

"Not so long ago, it was a regular part of my job as a journalist covering Capitol Hill to stand in the hallways for hours waiting for bipartisan negotiations to conclude on a bill, and a deal to be announced. These days, there is rarely any standing around, because such bipartisan meetings almost never even happen anymore. This is just one illustration of the extent of today's dysfunction in Congress - and it shows how the notion of horse-trading that is required to reach compromise is becoming a lost art. It's not just that the extreme wings of both parties are emboldened.  It is also about experience - or lack thereof, in that art of legislating -- knowing what it means to give a little to get a little. Yet over the past several months, while much of Congress was on the campaign trail trying to get re-elected, there were bipartisan discussions quietly taking place on significant legislation - one to fund the government for the next year. That bill morphed into what is now widely known as the ""Cromnibus"" - a  $1.1 trillion,1,603-page bill that funds and sets the priorities for nearly all of the federal government. Even this small breakthrough mostly serves as a reminder of how messy the process has become. There are supposed to be 12 individual spending bills that pass Congress and go to the President's desk -- not one monster-sized bill. Even House Appropriations Chair Hal Rogers, a chief GOP negotiator, says ""it's too big of a bite to digest and members generally aren't familiar with what's in all those bills."" Still, in today's fractured times, a so-called ""omnibus"" is a step up from the way things had been going - careening from fiscal crisis to fiscal crisis - then kicking the can down the road year to year with a continuing resolutions keeping the government running.  The ""omnibus"" may be unruly, but at least lawmakers sat down in a bipartisan way for the first time in a while and tried to reset how America spends its money, and by extension, its priorities on everything from new threats like Ebola to fundamental needs like infrastructure, defense, and government assistance for the needy. Reaching bipartisan agreement on funding so many different aspects of the federal government, in which the parties have fundamental differences in philosophy, requires real compromise. Finding that compromise really is an art - the art of legislating.  To practice that art, you have to be willing to give things up. ""We worked across the aisle. We worked across the dome. We practiced civility. We argued. We debated. We fought. You know, sometimes you give a little, you take a little, but you stand up for them all,"" explained Sen. Barbara Mikulski, Senate Appropriations Chair and principal Democratic negotiator. One of the most partisan political figures in recent times was the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass, but he was also one of the most successful legislators in the history of the Senate. He knew that achieving his goals took time and patience, and he was willing to give a little to Republicans to get a little for Democratic priorities. There were lots of Republicans who did the same. With the influx of so-called Tea Party Republicans over the past four years came a number of lawmakers with an all or nothing attitude. That has made it nearly impossible for House Speaker John Boehner, a legislator at heart, to cut deals. Over the past few days, the same issue has emerged on the left. Freshman Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a liberal icon, has been rallying progressive Democrats against the ""cromnibus"" spending bill because it includes what she calls a poison pill - repealing a key reform intended to protect consumers post-financial meltdown. Warren, like so many of her colleagues, knows no other way to do business on Capitol Hill. When the new Congress is sworn in next month, more than 40 senators will only have served since 2011. That's more than 40 percent of the most deliberative body in the world, with only four years' experience deliberating - at most. ""Some of the members here have never known what it's like to go through a normal legislative process, so they've got a lot to learn,"" explains Sen. John McCain. Another reason there is less horse-trading is that there aren't as many horses to trade.  Earmarks on spending bills, otherwise known as pork barrel spending, was the most valuable currency on Capitol Hill.  But bringing home the bacon became abused so often that pork became a dirty word and now earmarks are banned in a bipartisan way. That makes it hard for party leaders to force compromise by giving reluctant lawmakers some buy in. Those of us who demand and value transparency may have also contributed to the demise of compromise by going through legislation and uncovering what was slipped in to seal the deal. This is not a bad thing - but lawmakers' fear about issues hidden inside a bill coming to light has had an undeniable effect on legislating. Talk to those who actually negotiated the ""Cromonibus"" bill and they will say this is how a democratic legislature is supposed to work - giving and taking. Sources in both parties say Republicans were demanding six provisions to roll back Wall Street reforms, and Mikulski got them down to one - the so-called derivative swaps change. Warren is up in arms, but Mikulski, her fellow Democrat known as dean of the Senate women, considered it a victory. Mikulski can barely contain her frustration. ""For hours after hours after hours, and the last several days, I have heard what's wrong with this bill,"" said an animated Mikulksi on the Senate floor. ""Now we've got to start talking about the good aspects of the bill, and why we did this bill in the first place,"" she said. But for all the chaos surrounding the final hours of this 113th Congress, there are some senators walking the hallways who have hope that things will get better. ""We have lost some of our sharpness in legislating,"" said Sen. Johnny Isakson. ""But I think that's going to come back.""","The art of compromise is being lost on Capitol Hill .
The extreme wings of both parties are emboldened .
Many legislators are unfamiliar with traditional negotiations ."
"(CNN) -- The masked man had already cut her chest open when the lights went off, plunging the entire room into darkness. This was not good. In fact, it was downright dangerous. A power outage is probably the last thing anyone would want to happen midway through surgery, let alone while performing the delicate task of closing a hole inside the heart of a six-year-old girl. But Dr Godwin Godfrey and his team had come prepared. ""We knew that we always have power cuts in the hospital -- they can happen at any time, even at night -- so we had prepared a back-up manual handle that we could use to run the pump by hand,"" says Godfrey, who works at the Bugando Medical Center in Mwanza, north Tanzania. A reliable and constant electricity supply is crucial when performing open heart surgery -- the procedure is done under general anesthesia and requires the use of an electrically powered machine that acts as the patient's heart and lung. Read this: Birth advice by text message . Godfrey and his team also knew that it usually takes several seconds for the hospital's back-up generator to kick in after a power failure. Therefore, they'd previously connected the heart-lung and anesthesia machines to an uninterruptible power supply in case of an emergency. ""Even though all the lights in the operating room went off, the machines themselves were still working,"" recalls the young doctor. ""So this was what actually saved us that day."" Saving lives . That day was late last month, right after Godfrey had returned to Tanzania from Israel with a skill no one else in his country has. Following five years of intense training, Godfrey is now Tanzania's only pediatric heart surgeon capable of carrying out open heart surgeries on small children. Upon his arrival, he started operating on young children, including six-year-old Merina, with the assistance of the Israeli team who'd trained him. ""Although we had all these problems in the surgery, the child recovered very well and she left the intensive care unit the next day,"" says Godfrey about Merina. ""So this was very good."" 'Somebody has to do something' The son of a doctor, Godfrey grew up in Moshi, a beautiful small town nestled on the foothills of Mount Kilimanjaro. He went on to become a doctor himself and started practicing about seven years ago, setting his mind to becoming a plastic surgeon. But at that time a Tanzanian surgeon who'd returned home from the UK, with the aim of starting a cardiac center, recruited Godfrey to his team. ""It's when I started working with him that I realized that ... in Tanzania we really don't have so much need for plastic surgery,"" says Godfrey. ""I realized children are the ones who are suffering most in Africa -- we have so many children with heart diseases dying without any care and those few lucky ones the government gets to send them abroad for surgery,"" he adds. Watch this: Ghana'a heart surgery pioneer . Determined to make a difference, Godfrey approached doctors visiting the hospital, asking them to help him find a way to create a Tanzanian team that could do pediatric heart surgery. Eventually, he got in touch with Save a Child's Heart, an Israeli organization providing heart surgeries and care to children from developing countries. After securing funding, Godfrey headed to Israel where he trained for five years with Save A Child's Heart before returning to Tanzania and putting his life-saving knowledge to use. ""Somebody has to do something -- and this is one of the reasons I came back,"" says Godfrey. ""But do I feel confident that I will be able to build a good department and a good team? Well not really,"" he readily admits. ""So I am also very terrified of the fact that I am worried that I may not be able to build this good team. But again, it's this worry which will keep me up on my feet every day trying to push a little bit harder."" Urgent needs . When it comes to impoverished African nations, the focus often tends to be on AIDS, malnutrition and malaria. But there are a multitude of other medical conditions that require urgent attention, such as children's heart problems. In Tanzania's largest referral and teaching hospital, some 300 children a year await surgery. There are thousands more in need across the country. Read this: African midwife, Nobel Peace Prize? Godfrey says there are, at best, just 5,000 doctors in Tanzania, a country where more than 70% of the 45 million-population lives in villages, often far from hospitals or equipped medical centers. He says this puts a ""big burden"" on doctors who often have to work under extremely challenging conditions. ""Many doctors don't want to even go out of the big cities,"" he explains. ""Every doctor wants to work in a place where there's at least some medication, there's even a ward ... that they can also provide this kind of care. Now going to the village with all the knowledge that you've acquired and you still cannot manage to do anything -- these are places no doctor wants to go."" Healing hearts . Inside the Bugando Medical Center, the overwhelming need for doctors and trained medical personnel is evident. At the hospital's children's ward, the beds are occupied at all times by two, sometimes three, very sick children, while young patients with heart problems and their families lie on benches outside examining rooms. It's a far cry from the wards where Godfrey trained in Israel. ""Working in Israel,"" says Godfrey, ""one of the things that struck me most at the beginning was that we could spend six months and not even see one child dying, while here in a day, one pediatric admission, we could see even five, sometimes up to seven, children dying,"" he adds. ""You realize that we still have a very long way to go."" But despite all the challenges, Godfrey is determined to continue his life-saving efforts and build a team that would heal as many of Tanzania's broken hearts as possible. ""Now I am even thinking of the ways to push my department forward,"" says Godfrey. ""I know I don't have a complete team yet, some are still in training back in Israel, but it is my hope in the next few years that we will have a complete team, if everything goes well.""","Dr Godwin Godfrey is Tanzania's only children's heart surgeon .

"(CNN)There are 2,325 billionaires in the world, according to the Wealth-X and UBS Billionaire Census 2014, and just over 12% of them are women. With a combined wealth of $930 billion, the world's richest females are making their mark on the global economy -- and their fortunes are only expected to improve in 2015. Of the 286 female billionaires identified, only 17% have self-made fortunes. The U.S. is currently home to the highest number of self-made female billionaires -- but future billionaires creating their own fortunes are predicted to come primarily from emerging markets. These wealthy women have an average age of 61 years and over 65% of them inherited their wealth from multinational corporations, including retail store Walmart and cosmetics giant L'Oreal. Below, CNN reveals the women at the pinnacle of the rich list in each of the world's regions. The wealthiest woman in North America is Christy Walton. As the widow of John Walton, son of Walmart founder Sam Walton, Christy Walton inherited a portion of the retail fortune following her husband's death in 2005. With an estimated worth of $37.9 billion she is the world's richest woman. In recent years, Walton has stepped into the world of film production, bankrolling 2013 movie ""Bless Me, Ultima,"" based on the controversial novel by Rudolfo Anaya. Globally, the U.S. is the country with the highest number of billionaire residents -- both male and female. It boasts 609 of the world's richest people. The oldest female on the list is L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt, who turned 92 last year. Aged just 15, Bettencourt joined her father's cosmetics company as an apprentice and today her $31.3 billion fortune makes her the richest woman in Europe, and the second richest female in the world. Europe is home to more billionaires than any other region, with 775 of the world's monied elite living there. Australasia's wealthiest woman is mining heiress Gina Rinehart. Described by Forbes as the ""queen of the global iron-ore trade,"" the 60-year-old controls Hancock Prospecting and is worth an estimated $14.8 billion. Rinehart has now expanded her portfolio beyond mining with significant shares in Australian media organizations Fairfax Media and Ten Network Holdings. Vanessa, Maria and Johanna Slim are daughters of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim and are the richest women in Latin America. The sisters have reportedly been receiving increments of their father's fortune since 2003 and today are thought to individually have a worth of $6.3 billion, giving them a combined total of almost $19 billion. The sisters have been active in their father's philanthropy foundations, but not the family business, according to Institutional Investor. At 33-years-old, Yang Huiyan is the youngest female on the list as well as being the richest woman in Asia. Having reportedly received 70% of the shares for Chinese real estate firm Country Garden from her father in 2007, Huiyan is now worth an estimated $6.3 billion. Yang is vice chairman of the board's governance committee and helped raise $410 million selling new shares last year, according to Forbes. U.S.-born Israeli Shari Arison is the wealthiest woman in the Middle East after inheriting a fortune from father Ted Arison, founder of the Carnival Corporation cruise company. She now owns Arison investments, the controlling shareholder of Israeli bank Hapoalim. Arison has also invested in water company Miya, which aims to maximize the efficiency of water distribution in urban areas. Forty of the world's billionaires live in Africa. The richest woman on the continent is Nigerian oil, fashion, and printing tycoon Folorunsho Alakija. The self-made billionaire, whose entrepreneurial career started tailoring, now owns Famfa Oil and is worth an estimated $1.2 billion. Insight: Most inspiring women of 2014 .

"Nine years after the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, a seismic event in Lebanese history, the trial of four men accused of his killing opened Thursday in a special United Nations-backed court. However, the stand at the Special Tribunal for Lebanon in The Hague was empty, with the suspects -- alleged associates of the Shiite militant group Hezbollah -- still on the run. Billionaire statesman Hariri was killed in February 2005 when a bomb struck his motorcade near the Beirut seafront. The blast ripped apart his armored car and destroyed the motorcade, killing 21 other people and wounding more than 200 others. It was a moment that changed Lebanese history, fueling the sectarian divisions between Sunni and Shiite Muslims in the Mediterranean country and leading to the withdrawal of Syrian troops. The special court investigating the assassination announced in February 2012 that Mustafa Badreddine, Salim Ayyash, Hussein Oneissi and Assad Sabra would be tried in absentia. They face counts ranging from conspiracy to commit a terrorist act to murder and attempted murder. Hezbollah denies involvement. Hearing streamed live . Presiding Judge David Re opened the trial, presenting the indictments against the accused. Thursday's hearing also included the prosecution's opening statements, expected to continue until Friday, according to the official Twitter account of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon. ""This is a historic day for the Special Tribunal for Lebanon as it marks the transition from complex and difficult investigations to the new phase of trial,"" said Marten Youssef, a spokesman for the tribunal. The hearing is being streamed live online.  In Lebanon, television stations -- except for Hezbollah's Al Manar --  broadcast it live. ""A day for Lebanon"" Youssef said the case was the ""first trial for a crime of terrorism in an international tribunal."" It is being held in Leidschendam, on the outskirts of The Hague. Hariri's son Saad, also a former prime minister, and other family members have traveled to the city. Speaking outside the court building, Saad Hariri thanked the Special Tribunal for Lebanon ""for the opportunity to find justice against the criminals who committed this heinous crime."" ""Unfortunately the names of those who perpetrated these crimes are Lebanese, they follow a certain political party,"" he said. ""They are innocent until proven guilty. This is what we want ... justice, not vengeance. We never seek vengeance and hopefully by the end of this trial we will find out the truth and we will get the justice that we called for in Lebanon."" He said the start of the trial was ""a day for Lebanon; today is a day we fought for nine years."" Hariri's supporters say the businessman-turned-politician was killed because of his opposition to Syria's longtime military presence in his country, and his death led to popular protests, nicknamed the ""Cedar Revolution,"" that led Damascus to withdraw its troops. Syrian troops were deployed in Lebanon between 1976 and 2005, primarily in the north -- ostensibly at first as peacekeepers to help stop Lebanon's long civil war -- but maintained a significant presence long after the fighting stopped in 1990. Syria has denied accusations that it was behind the bombing. Car bomb . Shortly before the trial began, a bomb blast ripped through the northeastern Lebanese city of Hermel, killing three people and injuring 26 others, state news agency NNA reported. The explosion took place near city offices and a number of banks. Hermel is in the northern Bekaa Valley near the Syrian border and is known as a Hezbollah stronghold. NNA said a suicide bomber had blown up a car, and the army said expert teams were investigating the site. ""Army units in the region deployed and cordoned off the area, and a unit of the military police and a number of specialized experts came to the scene to investigate the site ... and remains found next to the car to specify the nature of the blast,"" the military said in a statement. Thursday's bombing was the latest in a wave of attacks to hit Lebanon in recent months as the civil war in Syria increasingly spills over the border into its smaller neighbor. Hermel has been targeted before, with missiles launched from Syria, where Hezbollah has sent fighters and military advisers.

"Two weeks after leading Chelsea to glory in the Europa League, Rafael Benitez has been unveiled as the new coach of Italian team Napoli. Benitez guided Chelsea to a 2-1 victory over Benfica in Amsterdam earlier this month having been appointed as the team's interim manager following the sacking of Roberto Di Matteo in November. The former Liverpool and Valencia boss moves to Naples on a two-year deal as a replacement for Walter Mazzarri, who has taken over at Inter Milan following the sacking of Andrea Stramaccioni. Mazzarri's Napoli finished the 2012-13 campaign second in Italy's top division, securing the team a place in next season's European Champions League. It was the club's best finish in the league since winning Serie A in 1990. ""Now that the agreement is confirmed, I can say I am very happy and very satisfied for having committed to a great club with an illustrious heritage like Napoli,"" the 53-year-old Benitez told his official website. ""I understand the history of the city and how the club forms a fundamental part of the culture and traditions of Naples. ""I must confess that I am extremely excited because I can share my passion for football with the fans of Napoli; it is proven that they are very, very special."" Napoli president Aurelio de Laurentiis tweeted a picture of himself shaking Benitez's hand, and wrote:  ""Rafa Benítez is the new coach of Napoli. A great man with international experience. A leader."" Benitez endured a difficult time at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea fans refused to accept him as a result of a rivalry he had had with the club while manager of Liverpool between 2004 and 2010 despite the club qualifying for the Champions League and winning the Europa League. The Spanish coach's first job at Napoli will be attempting to keep hold of star striker Edinson Cavani who is reportedly a target for Benitez's former employers Chelsea and Manchester City. Chelsea's Europa League triumph was the latest in a long list of major honors won by Benitez. The Madrid native won the same tournament -- then known as the UEFA Cup -- with Valencia in 2004, as well as two Spanish league titles. He then moved to Liverpool where he won the FA Cup in 2006, but the crowning moment of his career to date arrived a year earlier when he led the Anfield club to Champions League glory. Losing 3-0 to AC Milan at half time in the 2005 final, Liverpool scored three second-half goals before going on to seal a dramatic penalty shootout victory in Istanbul. Liverpool also reached the 2007 Champions League final. Benitez parted company with Liverpool in June 2010 before taking over at Inter just one week later. His spell at Inter Milan was mixed. Benitez won the FIFA World Club Cup with Inter before being sacked in December 2010. Fitness coach Francisco de Miguel Moreno and goalkeeping coach Vicente Javier Valero Berchili, who were both part of Benitez's backroom team at Liverpool, Inter Milan and Chelsea will join the Spaniard at Napoli.","Rafael Benitez appointed as new coach of Italian team Napoli .

"Manama, Bahrain (CNN) -- People prayed and demonstrated late Thursday outside a Manama hospital, where scores had come for treatment following a pre-dawn raid by government forces on an encampment of protesters that left at least four dead. Army vehicles, meanwhile, were patrolling the streets of Bahrain's capital. They filled the void left by government security forces, who hours earlier had stormed protesters gathered in Pearl Roundabout, a landmark circle in the city center. The throngs congregated Thursday night near the Salmaniya Medical Complex and chanted, ""With our blood and our souls, we will fight for the martyrs,"" voicing their resolve in the face of a government clampdown that has elicited sharp criticism in Bahrain and internationally. Six people have died since protesters took to the streets Monday demanding reform and the introduction of a constitutional monarchy. The tiny  but strategically critical island nation of Bahrain is an American ally and houses  the headquarters of the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet. Those killed in the Pearl Roundabout raid included Ali Abdullah, a 22-year-old who went to the protests with his 20-year-old brother, his father told CNN. The college senior, majoring in engineering, died at the hospital Thursday from his injuries. Ahmad Abdullah blamed Bahrain's prime minister -- Prince Khalifa bin Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, uncle of King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa who has held his position since 1971 -- for his son's death, calling the leader a ""killer."" Witnesses described a blunt show of force by police firing pellets, rubber bullets and tear gas to force protesters out of the square, where thousands had been rallying and in some cases encamping throughout the week. Zainab Farda said she was in a large tent for women and children with her two daughters, ages 6 and 8, when they woke up to tear gas. She said they placed onions over their noses, but had to flee after security forces set fire to their tent. ""After all that has happened, we are not going to quit,"" Farda said. ""If we quit now, we're going to die."" Before word of the latest death, health minister Dr. Faisal Ben Yacoub Al Hamar said on state television that three people had died and at least 225 had been injured in the raid. Bahrain is one of the latest countries in the Middle East and North Africa to face a surge of dissent following the revolts that toppled longtime autocrats in Tunisia and Egypt. While Bahrain's interior ministry said in a statement Wednesday that those responsible for the two earlier deaths had been detained, authorities on Thursday defended their actions at the Manama roundabout. They said security forces used a minimum of force and found firearms, knives and flags of Hezbollah, a Lebanon-based group that the United States lists as a terrorist organization. In a news conference, Foreign Minister Khalid al Khalifa claimed protesters had attacked disciplinary forces -- saying he was surprised that they had, given the available freedoms in Bahrain. He added he plans to raise the issue of what happened in Manama with the country's king. Al Khalifa also disputed an assertion that troops came from neighboring countries, insisting that all those involved are from Bahrain. According to the state-run Bahrain News Agency, an interior ministry official said security forces evacuated the people after ""exhausting all opportunities for dialogue with them."" ""Some of them have responded and left quietly, while others refused to comply with the law, which called to intervene in order to disperse them,"" the official said. Bahrain's  army asked citizens to ""distance themselves from gatherings in vital  areas in the capital"" because it will ""create fear and shock"" and  cause serious traffic disruptions. But Ali Ahmed, 34, who said he has slept at the square since Monday night, said the attack only emboldened demonstrators. He called claims that police had warned protesters to evacuate ""a lie."" Ahmed had been one of about 3,000 people who laid out blankets and pitched tents at Pearl Roundabout this week, with police nowhere to be seen at times. But by the time police had completed their raid early Thursday, the circle was cleared of protesters and convoys of more than 50 military armored personnel carriers, each armed with machine guns, had driven into the area. Some of the trucks had razor wire. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon was among the international leaders who weighed in on Thursday, urging restraint and opposing government-led violence. He said that he is ""disturbed by the violent means used to disperse demonstrators."" The British Foreign Office confirmed Thursday it had temporarily closed its embassy in Bahrain. British Foreign Secretary William Hague said he spoke with his Bahrainian counterpart and stressed the ""need for peaceful action to address the concerns of protesters."" Jennifer Stride,  a U.S. Fifth Fleet spokeswoman, said there's no ""indication the protests will  cause significant disruption"" for the U.S. military, which she said is  not being targeted. The fleet has more than 30 ships, including the aircraft carriers USS Enterprise and USS Carl Vinson and their respective carrier strike groups . U.S. Secretary of  State Hillary Clinton said, meanwhile, that the United States has told Bahrain it has ""deep concerns"" about the crackdown on anti-government protesters and said the protesters' funerals and Friday prayers should ""not be marred by violence."" ""We  call on restraint from the government, to keep its commitment to hold  accountable those who have utilized excessive force against peaceful  demonstrators, and we urge a return to a process that will result in  real, meaningful changes for the people there,"" Clinton said. Bahrain's king has asked Abdul Latif Bin Rashid Al Zayani -- a former major general who headed Bahrain's public security for 10 years -- to be an unofficial envoy to the United States to deal with diplomatic fallout from the crisis, according to senior State Department officials and other sources familiar with the appointment. Zayani was already in Washington holding meetings as the incoming leader of the Gulf Cooperation Council, and the king asked him to stay to talk with U.S. officials, the sources said. He met Thursday at the State Department with Under Secretary William Burns, Assistant Secretary Jeff Feltman and Dennis Ross, a White House adviser on the Middle East. Still, the most significant political reaction may be within Bahrain itself. Hours after the crackdown at Pearl Roundabout, the Al Wefaq political party announced it had decided to withdraw from parliament, party official Abdul Jalil Khalil said. Al Wefaq had been the most well represented party in the lower chamber of parliament, with 18 out of 40 seats. Khalil, who has been head of the Al Wefaq parliamentary bloc, explained that the unrest is ""a turning point"" for the nation of about 1 million people. He noted that the casualty figures are ""large scale"" given the size of the population. ""After what happened today, people are asking us to leave parliament. Quit the government,"" Khalil said. Al Wefaq is a Shiite party in a country that, despite the fact two-thirds of its population are Shiites, is ruled by a Sunni Muslim royal family. In recent years, younger Shiites have staged violent protests to complain about discrimination, high unemployment and corruption. Any Shiites say the country's constitution has done little to improve their condition. Barak Seener, a Middle East fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank, said he thinks the party's withdrawal will lead ""to the greater disenfranchisement of the Shia majority"" and that the upheaval is ""very, very dangerous"" for the United States. ""It's so important for the United States to have a friendly regime there,"" Seener said. He emphasized that Bahrain ""has no choice but to clamp down"" and can't afford to ""blink"" amid the turmoil. ""A disenfranchised Shia population is very dangerous because it has the ability to destabilize Bahrain and it also is vulnerable to Iranian penetration,"" he said. ""There's been numerous cells of Shia terrorists that have been uncovered with extensive links to the Iranian regime. Iran uses them as a proxy to extend their sphere of influence."" Al Khalifa stressed to reporters Thursday that both Shiite and Sunni Muslims in the country are loyal and patriotic. ""We belong to one homeland,"" he said. CNN's Arwa Damon, Nic Robertson and Journalist Mansoor Al-Jamri in Bahrain, CNN's Joe Sterling in Atlanta and CNN's Elise Labott and Chris Lawrence in Washington contributed to this report.","NEW: Bahrain's king apoints envoy to U.S. to deal with diplomatic fallout, officials say .

"Bayern Munich joined fellow German side Borussia Dortmund in the final of the European Champions League by completing a crushing 7-0 aggregate win over Barcelona in the Nou Camp Wednesday. Leading 4-0 from the semifinal first leg in the Allianz Arena, Bayern ruthlessly pulled apart a Barcelona side missing their talisman Lionel Messi, who sat out the second leg on the bench. After a goalless first half, a fine Arjen Robben strike, a Gerard Pique own goal and a Thomas Mueller header ended any lingering hopes of a Barca comeback in a 3-0 victory for the visitors. Home coach Tito Vilanova decided against risking his star asset Messi despite him scoring in the weekend win over Athletic Bilbao. Messi injured his hamstring in their quarterfinal tie against Paris St Germain and has been nursing the problem the last few weeks, cutting an often forlorn figure in Munich in the first leg. Without his creative influence, the La Liga champions in waiting were first kept in check then dismantled by a Bayern side reaching their third Champions League final in the past four years. The previous two appearances have seen defeat to Inter Milan in 2010 and Chelsea last year but they will start favorites at Wembley on May 25 against Dortmund. With the Bundesliga title already wrapped up and an appearance in the German Cup final against Stuttgart on June 1, coach Jupp Heynckes will be looking to sign off as Bayern coach with a treble triumph. Former Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola takes over at Bayern next season, doubtless relishing the task on the evidence of their comprehensive defeat of his former charges in the semifinal. Robben came close to breaking the deadlock in the first half, but delayed his shot. When given a second chance just after the break the Dutch international, a former Real Madrid player, cut inside to beat Valdes with a curling shot. Franck Ribery set up the further goals, first bursting clear down the left in the 72nd minute to see his cross turned clumsily into his own net by Pique. Four minutes later a similar run left Mueller to head home at the far post and complete the rout. All the time Messi sat glumly on the bench as the task became hopeless even for his genius. Teammate Pique reflected on one of the worst reverses in the history of a proud club. ""Perhaps it was the bitterest night I have had at Barcelona,"" he told  Spanish Canal Plus television. ""We tried but they scored a goal very early in the second half and this  left us broken. The last 25 minutes were very difficult."" Robben, by contrast, is already looking forward to the final against their arch German rivals. ""To win 4-0 and 3-0 away, especially the 3-0 here, it is amazing,"" he told Sky Sports. ""Now we are in the final for the third time in four years and it is time to win this thing now.""","Bayern Munich into Champions League final with 3-0 win over Barcelona .

"The New York Times says Chinese hackers have carried out sustained attacks on its computer systems, breaking in and stealing the passwords of high-profile reporters and other staff members. According to The Times, one of the biggest and most respected U.S. newspapers, the cyberassaults took place over the past four months, beginning during an investigation by the newspaper into the wealth reportedly accumulated by relatives of the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao. The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that its computer systems also had been infiltrated by Chinese hackers. The hackers were monitoring the newspaper's China coverage, according to a written statement from Paula Keve, chief communications officer for parent company Dow Jones & Co. ""Evidence shows that infiltration efforts target the monitoring of the Journal's coverage of China, and are not an attempt to gain commercial advantage or to misappropriate customer information,"" the statement read, according to The Journal. The Times's reports on Wen's family members, alleging they had amassed financial holdings worth billions of dollars through business transactions, infuriated Chinese authorities, who responded by blocking access to The Times' website in mainland China. The Times said in an extensive article dated Wednesday that it had worked with computer security experts to monitor, study and then eject the attackers. It said that by following their movements, it aimed to ""erect better defenses to block them"" in the future. The newspaper said that the security experts it used to counter the attacks had accumulated ""digital evidence that Chinese hackers, using methods that some consultants have associated with the Chinese military in the past, breached The Times's network."" Asked about The Times's allegations on Thursday, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said that ""all such alleged attacks are groundless, irresponsible accusations lacking solid proof or reliable research results."" China has been the victim of cyberattacks and ""has laws and regulations prohibiting such actions,"" the spokesman, Hong Lei, said at a regular news briefing. A separate statement from the Chinese Ministry of National Defense said the country's military ""has never supported any hacker activities."" The U.S. State Department said that The Times's experience with Chinese hackers is similar to those of other businesses and individuals and that the department has expressed its concerns to Chinese officials. ""The United States has substantial and growing concern about the threats to economic and national security posed by cyberintrusions, including the theft of commercial information,"" department spokesman Peter Velasco said in a statement. ""We have repeatedly raised our concerns with senior Chinese officials, including military officials, and we will continue to do so."" On Thursday, it appeared that television censors in China were blacking out CNN's reporting of the hacking story. China-focused journalists targeted . According to The Times, the intruders hacked into the e-mail accounts of its Shanghai bureau chief, David Barboza, the reporter on the controversial articles about Wen's relatives' wealth, and Jim Yardley, the New Delhi bureau chief who had previously covered China. ""What they appeared to be looking for,"" the Times article said, ""were the names of people who might have provided information to Mr. Barboza."" But the security experts hired by the newspaper ""found no evidence that sensitive emails or files from the reporting of our articles about the Wen family were accessed, downloaded or copied,"" said Jill Abramson, executive editor of The Times. The investigators gathered evidence that the hackers obtained the corporate passwords for every Times employee, using them to break into the personal computers of 53 employees, most of them outside the newsroom. With the level of access the intruders had gained, senior editors at the newspaper were reportedly worried that they might attempt to disrupt the news organization's publishing systems, notably on the night of the U.S. presidential election in November, when it said the attackers were especially active. ""They could have wreaked havoc on our systems,"" Marc Frons, the Times' chief information officer, said in the newspaper's report. ""But that was not what they were after."" There was no evidence the hackers used the passwords they obtained to pursue information not connected to the Wen family investigation, The Times said, adding that no customer data were stolen. The Times said it informed and ""voluntarily briefed"" the FBI about the attacks. An angry reaction last year . At the time of the publication of the initial Times report on Wen's family in October, Chinese authorities called it an attempt ""to blacken China's image,"" saying it had ""ulterior motives."" It came at a particularly sensitive time in China, a matter of weeks before the start of the ruling Communist Party's 18th National Congress, at which the country's next set of leaders was announced. The Times' English- and Chinese-language websites remain blocked in mainland China, as do those of Bloomberg News, which in June published a report on the business interests of relatives of Xi Jinping, who is now the country's top leader. The Chinese government tries aggressively to control the flow of information inside its borders about sensitive topics like unrest in Tibetan areas and criticism of senior officials. It strictly manages the output of domestic news media outlets and has a history of shutting off access to international news websites. Chinese authorities have blacked out the broadcast signal for international television stations like CNN and the BBC when they have aired sensitive reports about the country.","The Wall Street Journal says Chinese hackers entered its computer system too .

"Hardcore Italian football ""ultra"" Federico is a Lazio supporter who happily admits directing monkey chants at black players. It is ""a means to distract opposition players"" says Federico, a member of the Irriducibili (""The Unbeatables"") group which follows the Rome-based team. ""I am against anyone who calls me a Nazi,"" Federico told academic Alberto Testa, who spent time ""embedded"" with Lazio and Roma ultras for the book ""Football, Fascism and Fandom: The UltraS of Italian Football,"" co-authored by Gary Armstrong. ""What I do not like is people who come to my country and commit crimes; Albanians and Romanians are destroying Rome with their camps,"" Federico adds. ""But I'm not a racist. One day, I was waiting in my car at the traffic lights and, as usual, there was a young female gypsy who was trying to clean the car windscreen and was asking for money. ""Suddenly municipal police officers started to mistreat the girl. I jumped out of my car and almost kicked his arse. I hate injustice."" There is nothing black and white about Italian football. Racist abuse has provided the backdrop to the Serie A season, with the latest incident -- not for the first time -- involving AC Milan striker Mario Balotelli, who was targeted by visiting Roma fans throughout a match at the San Siro Stadium in May. In the second half referee Gianluca Rocchi called the game to a halt for a few minutes, having warned the crowd via the public address system. Days after his return to Serie A earlier in 2013, following his move from Manchester City to AC Milan, Italy-born Balotelli was referred to by his new club's vice president Paulo Berlusconi -- the younger brother of the team's owner and the former Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi -- as ""the family's little black boy."" That remark came after, in what appeared to be an innocuous friendly match against fourth tier Italian side Pro Patria last month, Milan midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng picked up the ball and kicked it into the stands before tearing off his black-and-red striped shirt and walking off in protest at the persistent monkey chanting to which he and three of his black teammates had been subjected. In the aftermath of Boateng's walkout, Italian interior minister Annamaria Cancellieri told Radio 24 that if only a small group of fans were involved in  racist chanting, games should not be suspended, but if ""a significant part of the fans take part"" the game should be stopped ""by those responsible for public order."" As Italy grapples with how best to confront racism, it is worth remembering it's not the only country working out a solution as to how to deal with the problem. Neo-Nazis and neo-Fascists . This season, matches across Europe have been punctuated by repeated racist outbursts, which have led to calls for world governing body FIFA and European counterpart UEFA to show greater leadership and impose harsher sanctions. Amid the monkey chants and racial stereotyping, there are no easy answers to the question of just how prevalent is the incidence of racist abuse in Italian football. According to the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) in Feburary, there have been 50 incidents in Italy of racist abuse over the last six years. Of those 50 cases, 48 relate to racist chanting, with two relating to abusive banners. ""And the total of violent episodes diminished from 209 to 60 and the majority of them happened outside the football venues,"" FIGC spokesman Diego Antenozio told CNN. ""The introduction of stewarding has also reduced the need of intervention by police officers inside the venues significantly."" However, talk to the head of Italy's Observatory on Racism and Anti-racism in Football, Mauro Valeri, who has been monitoring racism in Italian football for over a decade, and a different picture emerges. His organization estimates there have been over 660 racial incidents since 2000 and puts the number since 2007 at 282, nearly six times as much as the FIGC figure. In all, fines of $5 million have been handed out as punishment in those 660-plus cases, equating to a fine of $7,500 per incident. ""The numbers I record relate to the decision that the judge takes in the sports court and lays down fines and any disqualifications. The FIGC figures concern the criminal law,"" said Valeri. ""So in the Boateng case the sports court ruled that Pro Patria had to play the game ... 'behind closed doors' and were fined $6,689. ""But the ordinary court -- the criminal law -- has instead decided that those songs were not racist. For me it's racism, for the Ministry of the Interior, no."" Valeri added: ""In Italy, no club has a real anti-racist strategy, because it believes the fight against racism is not a priority. ""Since the early 1990s, many curves of the stadium have been occupied by neo-Nazi and neo-Fascist groups, but this problem has been addressed only as a problem of public order."" That is a view that is supported by Italian football writer Charles Ducksbury, a fan of Verona, who added: ""The ultra still, and always will hold all the power at clubs. They choose what is sung, what everyone does and how they do it. ""Stewards and police hardly ever enter the curve as they would most likely get beaten up. Ultras say if the authorities stay out the curve, there won't be any problems. Almost all trouble happens outside the ground anyway, so that's where police tend to hang around."" Time warp . While Boateng walked off, former Netherlands international Edgar Davids, who played for both AC Milan and Inter Milan as well as Juventus, said he felt it was important to show that racist abuse did not affect him as a player during the many years of his career he spent in Italy. ""You would have a problem in certain areas,"" Davids told CNN. ""But you are a professional, you have an obligation to your team. My opinion was I'm a professional and the smartest way is to play so good that you make them even angrier. ""It is also about ignorance, a fear of the unknown. If you are interested in different cultures, it's normal. ""If you're not, you don't understand that concept. It is not only in Italy and it is not the whole of Italy. It was only certain teams you played, but 80-90% I didn't have a problem in Italy,"" added Davids, though Valeri's analysis suggests the problem is much more widespread. If football, race and politics make for a combustible mix in Italy, it is also arguable that the standard of the country's stadia is not helping. While English football was forced to grapple with extensive stadium renovation to improve facilities for fans due to recommendations made by Lord Justice Taylor after the deadly crowd disasters at Hillsborough and Heysel in the 1980s, Italian football was left in a time warp. ""I really don't believe that Italian football has learned the lessons of Heysel and Hillsborough, or at least hasn't implemented any tangible changes at anything like the pace required,"" said another Italian football writer Adam Digby. ""While the Taylor report and formation of the Premier League put English football at the forefront of fan safety and gave it ultra-modern stadia almost throughout the league, Serie A still plays host to a number of ancient, decrepit grounds. ""Many are still those built for Italia '90 with places such as Verona's Bentegodi and the San Paolo in Naples particularly poor on both counts. ""The problems extend to a lack of quality stewarding and lax ticket security while the ultras bring even greater problems to the situation."" Owen Neilson, who is writing a book about Italian football stadia -- ""Stadio: The Life and Death of Italian Football"" -- concurs that the lack of stadium redevelopment has held back Italian football. Of Serie A's big clubs, only Juventus has built a new stadium, he notes. ""The modernity of the stadia is the central issue to declining attendances -- families do not want to sit in the cold, unfriendly surroundings,"" said Neilson. ""In my opinion the league needs to harness to new stadiums to help maximize Serie A's re-emergence."" So what's the solution? ""The FIGC makes a relevant anti-racism activity both in the national and international domain according to the UEFA policy and guidelines, and is member of anti-discrimination organization Football against Racism in Europe,"" said the Italian Football Federation in its statement to CNN. ""Specific guidelines are part of National License Club System's requirements, as are the anti-racism initiatives that are made through FIGC Youth & School Department to involve 860,000 young footballers."" But as Italian historian John Foot, author of the authoritative book on Italian football ""Calcio"" points out: ""The Italian authorities have been all over the place on racism for a long time."" Racist chants . Valeri, meanwhile, urged the FIGC to donate the racism fines it recoups from the clubs for initiatives against racism, as does UEFA in its work with FARE. ""Any solution has to revolve around the football authorities,"" added Professor Clifford Stott, who has advised governments and police forces internationally on crowd management policy and practice. Stott calls on FIFA and UEFA to do more. ""The FIGC, FIFA and UEFA must empower fan-based initiatives that are capable of creating a culture of self-regulation. The anti-racism agenda has come a long way in the last decades. ""By walking off Kevin-Prince and his fellow players have forced the agenda. The high-level political support for his action now means this might happen again, but this time during a much higher profile game -- perhaps even in the Champions League. The authorities have to react to this potential."" But Stott also warned against an indiscriminate reaction by the authorities. ""We have learned a great deal about crowd management since the Heysel disaster, and there must be recognition that it is not appropriate or constructive to sanction whole crowds,"" he said. ""The approach to security must be capable of differentiating between those fans that are acting illegally and those fans that are not. Failure to recognize this and to react indiscriminately runs a very real danger of escalating not reducing the problems.""","Racism in Italian football is a complex issue, highlighting different attitudes .

"Favored haunt of James Bond, gamblers, luxury yacht owners and Grace Kelly fans, Monaco looks increasingly set to also become the preferred destination of any self-respecting world class footballer. And who can blame them. What's not to like about the chance to strut your stuff in one of the world's most glamorous locations -- and not pay tax on your wages. Monaco have come a long way in a very short space of time and, with the money the club's Russian owner Dmitry Rybolovlev has to spend, it is a team that has every chance of upsetting the status quo in French football next season. When Rybolovlev -- worth $9.1 billion, according to Forbes -- bought a majority stake in the seven-time French champions in December 2011,  Monaco were bottom of French football's second tier. Fast forward a couple of years and Monaco have served notice of the extent of their ambitions by spending close to $180 million on signing Atletico Madrid striker Radamel Falcao, as well as Porto pair Joao Moutinho and James Rodriguez. This, just a matter of weeks after wrapping up the second-flight title, with a young side coached by experienced Italian Claudio Ranieri. ""It's hard to think of a more serious statement of intent,"" former Monaco chief executive Tor-Kristian Karlsen told CNN. ""Falcao is simply the best out-and-out center forward in the world. With a signing of this caliber (Real Madrid's experienced Portugal defender Ricardo Carvalho will also play for Monaco next season), French football will seriously start closing the gap on the top European leagues."" These are signings that are likely to give newly crowned French champions Paris Saint-Germain, another club revived by massive investment, a run for their money in defending their Ligue 1 title. ""Everything is possible,"" said Karlsen. ""The team that won Ligue 2 -- even without the new acquisitions -- would have stabilized itself in the top eight of Ligue 1. ""But one should allow for the team to settle in the top half of Ligue 1 before expecting silverware,"" added Karlsen, who left Monaco in February after just over a year at the club. Monaco's upwardly mobile progression evokes memories of Chelsea's transformation after another Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich took control in 2003. In financial peril before the Russian oligarch arrived, Chelsea's trophy cabinet room is now brim to overflowing with 11 cups captured in the space of 10 years during the Abramovich era. Though at a no little cost. Abramovich has gone through nine managers, not to mention an estimated $1.5 billion of investment in players and wages. When Abramovich took charge of Chelsea, Ranieri was in charge of the team, but was sacked after one season and replaced by Jose Mourinho -- despite having led the club to second in the Premier League and to the semifinals of the Champions League. ""Ranieri is an excellent manager,"" said Karlsen, who stepped down from the chief executive role before the club's promotion due to personal reasons. ""He was -- and, in my opinion, still is -- the ideal manager for this project. ""The experience, the class, the professionalism he brought has been immensely important,"" added Karlsen, who had previously been Monaco's sporting director before his promotion to the chief executive role in September. ""He is very pragmatic, is aware of the politics of the game and just as importantly he's a great ambassador. "" Not that Monaco's ""grand projet"" has been universally welcomed by all in French football. Under the principality's laws, foreigners do not pay tax on their wages and that has put Monaco at odds with the French Football Federation (FFF) and the French League (LFP) after the latter organization ruled that the club must move their head office to France by the start of June next year. ""Monaco has enjoyed a position in French football that is totally unfair and that hasn't been questioned,"" France Football's English correspondent Philippe Auclair told CNN. ""The club has enjoyed an unfair advantage over every French club. Monaco should be subjected to the same tax regime as the other clubs in Ligue 1,"" added Auclair, who acknowledged that the French football authorities have allowed this anomaly to go on for too long. ""In any other country this would be unthinkable. Imagine if Welsh clubs Cardiff and Swansea didn't operate under the same taxation regime as the other 18 English Premier League clubs? ""The league has a perfect right to ask Monaco for this and the law should have been applied a long time ago."" But Monaco are refusing to play ball and have threatened to take legal action over the dispute. ""As part of this legal action, ASM FC will be seeking the annulment of the LFP's decision of March 21 requiring the club to establish its headquarters in France, as well as a claim for damages from the LFP as compensation for financial and commercial losses suffered as a result of that decision,"" Monaco said in a statement earlier this month. Monaco said French Federation president Noel Le Graet, ""acting on behalf of both the FFF and the LFP, demanded from AS Monaco FC a huge payment of $258 million in return for ending the current conflict without the club having to relocate its headquarters to France in order to remain in the French Championship."" Neither Le Graet or the LFP responded to CNN's request for comment. The French Football Federation then issued a statement, insisting it was Monaco who brought up the figure. ""The FFF had decided (on April 18) to set up a meeting between the Federation, the French Professional League (LFP) and AS Monaco FC. Preliminary talks started with representatives from AS Monaco FC, during which the sum of $258 million was mentioned by AS Monaco FC,"" said the FFF. ""My personal opinion is that AS Monaco has been treated disgracefully by the French football authorities,"" said Karlsen. ""What Monaco are doing is to the wider benefit of the French game. ""French football should welcome this foreign investment -- it makes the league stronger, improves the competitive balance and brings much-needed global exposure."" Karlsen suggested that the French authorities were in danger of ""shooting themselves in the foot,"" pointing out that when he was working for the club, Monaco had spent $6.4 million on Delvin N'Dinga from Auxerre. ""At the time Auxerre were struggling financially and on the brink of going out of business. ""Before the signing of Falcao, Moutinho and Rodriguez, I suspect the strategy had been to sign mainly French players from the domestic transfer market, but the club may well have reversed that strategy due to the scandalously poor treatment they have recently received from the French football authorities."" Before Rybolovlev's arrival, Monaco had been regular participants in European club competition until a steady decline set in, culminating in their relegation to Ligue 2 in 2011. ""Rybolovlev is very analytical and studious,"" said Karlsen of his former boss. ""He comes from a family of doctors and that is the way he has built his businesses -- by careful analysis. ""He's an avid student of the game. Whenever you go to his office you'll always find analytical books on the subject of football on his table, I'm obviously not talking about books like 'Fever Pitch,' "" said Karlsen, referring to Nick Hornby's book about football fandom. ""He is very knowledgeable about football and for him the strategy is quite simple -- to be successful,"" added the Norwegian, who before joining Monaco as technical director in January 2012 worked as a scout for Zenit St. Petersburg. ""Since he took over, the financial commitment has been amazing. ""He has always delivered on his promise to be successful and he won't settle for second best."" However given Monaco's average attendance last season was just over 5,000, the question remains how Monaco will meet UEFA's Financial Fair Play rules, which requires clubs to only spend money they earn, if and when the principality club qualifies for Europe. For now, though, those few thousand Monaco supporters can look forward to the treat of watching some of Europe's finest players.","Monaco looks set to become preferred destination of world class footballers .

"Russia has failed to take steps to end the Ukraine conflict, President Barack Obama said Wednesday in announcing expanded sanctions targeting two banks, two energy companies, Ukraine separatists and defense companies. European Union leaders also said they intended to increase sanctions, signaling growing Western concern over Russia's continued support for separatists battling the Ukrainian military in the country's eastern region. ""We have to see concrete actions, and not just words that Russia in fact is committed to trying to end this conflict along the Russia-Ukraine border,"" Obama told reporters at the White House. With the new sanctions, ""what we are expecting is that the Russian leadership will see once again that its actions in Ukraine have consequences, including a weakening economy, and increasing diplomatic isolation,"" the President said. His Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, warned that the sanctions were harming ties between the two nations. ""They generally have a boomerang effect and, without a doubt, in this case, are driving the Russian-U.S. relations into a stalemate and seriously damaging them,"" he said, according to a Kremlin transcript of his remarks to reporters on a visit to Brazil. ""I am certain that this is harmful to the U.S. Administration and American people's long-term strategic national interests."" He accused the United States of pushing the Ukrainian authorities toward a continued conflict, whereas Russia wants to see an immediate end to hostilities and a negotiated solution involving all sides, he said. Ukrainian President: Peace depends on Putin's mood . The latest U.S. sanctions build on earlier steps by targeting two major Russian banks -- Gazprom Bank and VEB -- and two energy companies -- Novotek and Rosneft. They will not be able to get new medium- and long-term financing in the United States, senior administration officials told reporters in a conference call. In addition, the new sanctions freeze any U.S. assets and prohibit American business contacts for eight Russian arms companies that make weapons, including small arms, mortars and surface-to-air missiles. One of the eight is the Kalashnikov Concern, maker of the AK-47 and other arms. Also on the list: Four Russian government officials, including the minister of Crimean affairs, along with the self-styled Luhansk People's Republic and Donetsk People's Republic leading the separatist campaign in eastern Ukraine, and Aleksandr Borodai, the self-declared ""prime minister"" of the Donetsk group. Targeting the separatist groups that simulate government structures prevents them from seeking financing, the senior administration officials noted. Earlier this year, the United States and Europe imposed a range of sanctions in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea this spring and massing of troops along its eastern border with Ukraine. The earlier sanctions included asset freezes and travel bans. 19 Ukrainian troops killed in rocket attack, military says . Russia and Ukraine have since been engaged in a tense standoff, including clashes between pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian forces in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. ""I've repeatedly made it clear that Russia must halt the flow of weapons and fighters across the border into Ukraine, that Russia must urge separatists to release their hostages and support a cease-fire, that Russia needs to pursue internationally-mediated talks, and agree to meaningful monitors on the border,"" Obama said. Russia has failed to do any of those steps, he added. Ukraine's government in Kiev has accused Russia of allowing weapons and military equipment, including tanks, to cross the border illegally into the hands of pro-Russian separatists. The senior administration officials who briefed reporters also leveled the same accusation. Meanwhile, the Pentagon said on Wednesday Russia now had 12,000 troops on the border with Ukraine, as well as some heavy weapons. The troop numbers had fallen to about 1,000 previously from a high of an estimated 40,000 forces earlier this year.

"(CNN) -- Syria has granted citizenship to thousands of stateless people in the country's Kurdish region, a move seen as a gesture to placate the predominantly Arab country's restive minority. State-run media said President Bashar al-Assad on Thursday issued a legislative decree granting ""Syrian Arab nationality"" to people registered as ""foreigners"" in Hasaka, the northeastern region where Kurds reside. There has long been discontent in the Kurdish region, and protests have been held there in recent days. Many Kurds have been stateless, and Human Rights Watch said they have faced obstacles, such as getting work and state services. Al-Assad has promised to deal with the issue over the years. ""In 1962, an exceptional census stripped some 120,000 Syrian Kurds -- 20 percent of the Syrian Kurdish population -- of their Syrian citizenship. By many accounts, the special census was carried out in an arbitrary manner,"" Human Rights Watch said in a July report. ""Brothers from the same family, born in the same Syrian village, were classified differently. Fathers became foreigners while their sons remained citizens. The number of stateless Kurds grew with time as descendants of those who lost citizenship in 1962 multiplied; as a result, their number is now estimated at 300,000."" Human Rights Watch, which notes that the Kurds are the largest non-Arab ethnic minority in Syria, estimated the Kurdish population to be 1.7 million, about 10 percent of Syria's population. The Syrian government, viewing Kurdish identity as a threat, has suppressed the group's political and cultural rights. Demonstrations in 2004 over longstanding complaints led to harassment and protests were put down with ""lethal force,"" Human Rights Watch said. At that time, at least 36 people were killed, 160 were injured, and more than 2,000 detained amid ""widespread reports of torture and ill-treatment of detainees,"" Human Rights Watch said. Massoud Akko, a Kurdish journalist and human rights defender based in Norway, told CNN there are two forms of stateless Kurds -- the majority, around 220,000, are called ""foreigners"" and they are the ones that the decree addresses. But there's another class of stateless people, numbering about 80,000, who aren't included in the decision. ""This is not enough. We need more,"" Akko said, referring to the political, social, and economic demands the people have made for decades. ""We as Kurds in Syria do not have the minimal ethnic rights, no schools, no cultural centers. We cannot even use our languages in the universities. We want to be equal to the Kurds living in Turkey, Iran and Iraq."" He said the regime made the move to placate Kurds, who've been angry over their treatment. However, three major Kurdish parties have called for protests Friday in Qamishli, Aleppo and other Syrian cities. Along with the basic rights they want, Kurds would like to see the Baathist Party rule come to an end and have more political parties formed. They also want freedoms in media and other realms, Akko said. They don't want to see the controversial 48-year-old emergency rule replaced by an equally oppressive terrorism law, and they demand a civilian rather than a military court system. CNN's Rima Maktabi contributed to this report.","President Bashar al-Assad issues a legislative decree on citizenship .

"At first, everything seemed routine -- an uneventful end to a second day of meetings between Thailand's bitter political rivals. Then the military trucks arrived, sealing off Bangkok's Thai Army Club, where the talks were being held. Armed soldiers in green camouflage rushed about, blocking entrances and exits as military vans, apparently carrying factional leaders, drove away. It seemed a coup was playing out, right in front of reporters' eyes. Soon, television programming fell silent, and Army chief Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha took to the air to confirm the news of a military takeover after five hours of talks meant to find a solution to Thailand's festering political crisis. Bangkok reacted calmly. Traffic was jammed downtown -- not unusual for rush hour in a city of nearly 7 million people. But it was surely a sign people wanted to make sure they got home before the military's 10 p.m. curfew. There did not appear to be any tension or panic, but then again, Bangkok is home turf for establishment protesters seeking the removal of what they consider a corrupt, tainted government. With TV and radio broadcasts airing only military messaging, it was impossible to know what the reaction was in Thailand's north, home to many populists angry over the recent removal of the country's democratically elected Prime Minister. According to Paradon Patthanathabut, national security adviser to the former government, the protest encampment of the populist ""Red Shirts"" had been cleared with military assistance. It wasn't clear if there had been any injuries or arrests. At the sprawling protest camp of the anti-government protesters, called ""Yellow Shirts,"" the military was nowhere to be found, and a sense of victory permeated the air. People sang, clapped and smiled broadly as they slowly packed up to go home, leaving the scene to resemble the closing hour of a festival. Martial law: What it means .

"Mario Balotelli has delivered his verdict on his time in the English Premier League -- he couldn't be happier to have left England. The Italian international, who quit Manchester City for AC Milan last January, endured a tumultuous two-year spell in England with his life being played out on television screens and splashed across the pages of the tabloid newspapers. Car crashes, throwing a dart at a youth team player, fireworks being set off in his bathroom and a training ground bust-up with the manager were all par for the course for football's ""enfant terrible"" during his time at City. The 22-year-old, who describes himself as just a ""normal guy,"" insists his treatment at the hands of the British press crossed a line. ""Yes,"" Balotelli told CNN when asked if he was unfairly treated in England. ""But I'm not here to talk about if I'm unfairly treated. I don't care. I'm out from England, I'm happy that I'm out from England. That's it. ""I'm really happy now. I have my family near me and my friends. I can relax and find my privacy, more than in England, where I was alone."" Despite the off-field misdemeanors, former manager Roberto Mancini constantly defended the player even though Balotelli's behavior tested a relationship which stretched back to when the Italian-born forward was a raw and talented 16-year-old at Inter Milan. However, the deterioration in the pair's relationship led to the striker being sold by City for $30 million to Milan. Mancini was relieved of his duties only last week following a season in which City failed to win a trophy. Back in Italy, Balotelli still attracts headlines, although he insists not all of the extraordinary incidents he has been linked with are factually correct. Twitter became a minefield of rumor and speculation with tales of Balotelli driving around Manchester, throwing money at homeless people -- just one of the untrue stories to have been concocted. ""The stuff that they said in the newspapers that I did in England in the past, few of those are real,"" he said. ""The others are really just the imagination of the journalists. But when you create an icon of a person in that kind of way, after everyone thinks you are like this and if you lie about it, everyone just thinks that it is all true. ""So maybe that's why they think I'm crazy and do crazy things? Sometimes I dream to be alone and that nobody would talk to me. ""A love of women I think is normal. Cars? I like fast cars and I don't see the problem if I like fast cars. ""Some things have happened in my life, some stuff unfortunately happened and they went on the newspapers straight away. But I don't see anything that would make people think that I'm bad or I'm crazy. I'm a normal guy. ""But I understand that football is really important and that everybody watches it. When you're famous you have to do photos or autographs, especially for the kids."" Back in Italy with his friends and family, Balotelli feels more comfortable and able to live freely in a way he found difficult to do so in England. But he admits that his past transgressions count against him and that general public has preconceived notions about his personality. ""Of course, even if you're the best in the world then some people don't like you and some people like you,"" added Balotelli. ""What is important for me is that the people who know me for real, know Mario how he really is. ""People who don't know me, they read newspapers and they watch TV. Television is made to give a lot of opinions, so I can't show the real Mario to everybody."" Since joining Milan, Balotelli has scored 11 goals in 12 games.","Mario Balotelli says he's happy to have left England .

"Beijing, China (CNN)As New Year's Eve messages go, Xi Jinping's speech on national television was almost pitch-perfect. Highlighting continued economic growth and rising living standard in 2014, the Chinese president -- entering the third year into his expected decade-long reign -- said he wanted to ""click the 'like' button"" for the country's 1.3 billion citizens, whose ""support for officials at all levels"" made such achievements possible. Xi -- who also heads the ruling Communist Party as well as the world's largest standing army -- promised deeper reform and the rule of law in the coming year, comparing them to ""a bird's two wings."" The 10-minute prerecorded address ended on an appeal for world peace. While he hit all the right notes, Xi saved the most dramatic metaphors for his massive anti-corruption campaign. The 61-year-old leader, considered China's most powerful in decades, reiterated his ""zero-tolerance"" stance, vowing to keep ""waving high the sword against corruption"" and ""fastening the cage of regulations."" For a nation still largely ruled from behind closed doors, however, official pronouncements after a series of year-end leadership meetings have offered better clues on Xi's ambitions and priorities in 2015. Corruption fight . In the last week of December, Xi presided over the gathering of the 25-member Politburo, the Communist Party's elite decision-making body. ""Organizing cliques within the Party to run personal businesses is absolutely not tolerated,"" read a statement issued after the meeting, while acknowledging the challenges in the ongoing fight against corruption, a lightning rod for mass discontent. The past year has certainly seen Xi break some powerful cliques involving an intricate web of officials, cronies and tycoons as well as billions of dollars worth of bribes and deals. He took down former domestic security czar Zhou Yongkang, likely soon to become the most senior Chinese official ever to face corruption charges; General Xu Caihou, once the military's second-in-command; and Ling Jihua, a top aide to ex-President Hu Jintao. State media have touted them as the three biggest ""tigers"" caught in Xi's now two-year-old anti-graft campaign, with a stated goal of targeting both ""tigers and flies"" -- high- and low-ranking officials. While applauded by many ordinary citizens, Xi's ever-wider dragnet has also attracted increasing scrutiny. ""The question remains to be whether Xi is taking a page from Chairman Mao,"" said longtime political analyst Willy Lam with the Chinese University of Hong Kong, noting the three fallen leaders were all considered to be Xi's political opponents. ""Starting with Mao, corruption has been used to take down enemies of the more powerful faction."" For the sake of stability within the Party, Lam predicted a moratorium on the hunt for ""big tigers"" -- anyone in the rank of a Politburo member and above -- in the next few years. READ MORE: Swatting flies? Beijing's fight to root out corruption . Sustainable development . Other observers even detect the anti-corruption campaign's ominous effect on the economy, the world's second largest. ""China's economic success had relied on some very capable people, who also happened to be corrupt because of the system,"" said economist Mao Yushi, one of the country's leading liberal voices. He pointed to the example of former railway minister Liu Zhijun, who was often credited with turning the country's high-speed rail network from nonexistent to the world's largest in a few years. Liu received a suspended death sentence in 2013 for corruption and abuse of power. ""Now we're getting rid of all of them,"" Mao added. ""The new reality is that officials don't want kickbacks but also feel no incentive to get anything done."" During a three-day economic policy meeting in early December, Xi and other top officials acknowledged the prospect of slower growth in 2015  -- probably still at an enviable rate of 7%, though, according to most analysts. The leaders reaffirmed their commitment to more sustainable development, including more ""green"" growth -- shortly before promulgating the country's toughest environmental laws in 25 years. ""The central government finally has the political will to address environmental issues thanks to public awareness of the smog problem,"" said Ma Jun, a leading environmentalist who directs the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs in Beijing. Welcoming the new law, Ma voiced his lingering concern: ""Weak enforcement has long been a big problem in China."" READ MORE: Xi Jinping's push to add 'chilli pepper' to China's anti-corruption drive . Master of the nation . ""The rule of law"" has become an unlikely catchphrase in state media since late October, when the Communist leadership made it the theme of a major meeting, and declared the importance of upholding the Constitution that enshrines the respect for human rights. ""Only if the Communist Party rules the country in line with the law, will people's rights as the master of the nation be realized,"" read a communiqué released after the gathering known as the Fourth Plenum. ""It's the rule of law with Chinese characteristics,"" said Lam, the Hong Kong analyst, before pointing to the Communist Party agency in charge of corruption probes. ""The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection is a powerful example of the Party operating outside the law -- the way it conducts its investigations."" The existence of a secretive process -- based on Party regulations instead of laws -- faced by accused Communist officials has come to light in recent years, amid reports of suspicious deaths of detainees in Party investigators' custody. Several victims' families have told CNN and other media that their loved ones were subject to lengthy detention and torture for refusing to admit wrongdoings. ""When the authorities don't play by the rules, nobody has freedom from fear -- I know I don't,"" said Mo Shaoping, a prominent Beijing lawyer known for defending politically sensitive cases involving dissidents and activists. His current clients include Gao Yu, a veteran journalist accused of leaking state secrets, and Pu Zhiqiang, a famous human rights lawyer who may soon face subversion charges. Both were detained by police last year around the time of the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen crackdown. ""I feel obligated to take these cases despite greater government pressure and personal risk,"" Mo said. ""The rule of law is reflected in individual cases -- that's why every case matters."" READ MORE: The Xi Jinping cipher: Reformer or a 'dictator?' Art serving socialism . Lawyers are not the only group feeling the squeeze from the authorities. One of the hottest topics across Chinese cyberspace so far in 2015 has been the case of vanishing cleavage in a hit television show called ""The Empress of China."" Reflecting aesthetics in seventh century Tang dynasty, the historical drama -- depicting the life of the only woman who ruled China in her own right -- had featured ample female bosoms before being suddenly pulled off air in late December. When the series returned to air on New Year's Day, viewers nationwide noticed crudely edited scenes, in which women were only shown in close-up shots to avoid revealing their chests. The show's creators probably should have seen this coming, though, after Xi addressed a delegation of actors, dancers and writers in Beijing last October. Underscoring the need for art to serve socialism and foster correct worldviews, the president told the artists not to pursue commercial success at the expense of producing work with moral values. ""Popularity should not necessitate vulgarity,"" Xi said. ""Pure sensual entertainment does not equate spiritual elation."" ""Anybody associated with thought work or ideology or the image of China -- everything is being squeezed or tightened or limited,"" said Jeremy Goldkorn, a leading commentator on China's media landscape. ""I think this is connected to Xi's idea of the new normal,"" he added. ""These things are going to go on, not just a cyclical campaign -- whether it's anti-corruption or tightening up on media, ideological issues."" Already, signs were plenty throughout last year: universities and state-run think tanks warned to toe the Party line in their teaching and research, civil rights groups forced to cancel most public events, and Google's popular Gmail service completely blocked in China. All the worrying developments have only confirmed some observers' grim view on Xi's signature political campaign. ""Fighting corruption is necessary,"" offered economist Mao. ""But it's a complex issue related to income, education, freedom of speech and the rule of law. Without fundamental changes in these areas, the campaign won't succeed in the long run."" ""There were expectations that once he consolidated power, he would launch far-reaching reforms -- but the past two years has not been encouraging,"" said analyst Lam.

"One of New York City's most exclusive restaurants is in a real pickle after being served a ""C"" grade by the New York City Department of Health. The restaurant, Per Se, was slammed by health inspectors after racking up 42 violation points during its inspection on February 19, city health department records showed. Per Se, one of only seven in New York City to earn three Michelin stars, previously had an ""A"" rating before the inspection. Violations listed in the latest health inspection included no hand-washing facility or soap in the food-prep area, hot and cold items held in improper temperatures, and eating or drinking in the food-prep area and tobacco use, all of which qualify as ""critical"" violations, according to the records. In its last inspection in June 2013, Per Se had only one violation worth 7 points, but previous inspections in 2013 and 2011 also fell into the 40-point range. Inspectors give an ""A"" for 0 to 13 points, ""B"" for 14 to 27 points and ""C"" for 28 or more, according to the health department's website. In a statement, Per Se's chef, Thomas Keller, said: ""We look forward to the opportunity to address the allegations with the Department of Health in the upcoming Oath Tribunal. At that time our final grade will be determined. As with all of our restaurants, we continue to maintain the highest standards at Per Se."" The restaurant will have a chance to argue the inspection at a hearing but must post a sign that reads ""Grade Pending"" until then. Keller oversaw the cuisine Sunday night at the Vanity Fair Oscar party, where guests enjoyed chicken pot pie and truffle lasagna, according to a menu that Keller tweeted. Per Se is considered the East Coast interpretation of Keller's French Laundry restaurant in Northern California.

"The families of two men who were gunned down in Boston in 2012 have filed wrongful death lawsuits against former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez, according to court documents. The $6 million lawsuits were filed Wednesday on behalf of the families of Daniel Abreu and Safiro Furtado, according to court papers. Hernandez, who is being held on charges related to another slaying, has not been charged in connection with the deaths of Abreu and Furtado. The lawsuits claim that Hernandez ""recklessly"" and ""maliciously"" shot a firearm from his vehicle into a vehicle carrying Abreu and Furtado, killing them. The two men were shot and killed in Boston while riding in a 2003 BMW. Two others in the car survived. At a news conference Wednesday, Salvatore Furtado said his son, Safiro, ""was a good boy, a hard worker, very intelligent,"" according to a woman who interpreted his comments from his native Cape Verdean dialect. Daniel Abreu supported the family and worked two jobs, his father, Ernesto, said. The prosecutor's office of Suffolk County has not identified any suspects in this case, according to Jack Wark, a spokesman for Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley. The investigation by the homicide unit of the Boston police and Suffolk County district attorney is ongoing and ""very active,"" Wark said. Civil suits may be filed while a criminal investigation is ongoing, but the step is unusual, said CNN legal analyst Paul Callan. Civil and criminal cases, however, have different standards of proof. The loss of Abreu and Furtado should matter and there is no reason to wait, said attorney William T. Kennedy. Meanwhile, Hernandez has been moved to a more restrictive jail unit while a fight with another inmate is investigated, Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson told CNN Thursday. Hodgson said the move wasn't disciplinary but rather standard procedure. Hernandez has been placed in a higher-level security unit and is allowed out of his cell for one hour a day, the sheriff said. He will not interact with other prisoners and must wear handcuffs and leg shackles. In January, unsealed court documents revealed that police had directly suggested that the former tight end may have pulled the trigger in the unsolved double homicides. ""There is ... probable cause to believe that Aaron Hernandez was operating the suspect vehicle used in the shooting homicides ... and may have been the shooter,"" said a recently unsealed warrant from June 2013. The warrant was used to search a bag of clothes with Hernandez's name on it and a Toyota 4Runner linked to him that, according to court documents, was seen at the scene of the crime by witnesses the night of the killings. CNN has reported that a grand jury has been looking into whether Hernandez played a role in the drive-by shooting, said law enforcement sources in January. Hernandez is awaiting trial on murder charges in the 2013 shooting death of his friend Odin Lloyd. He has pleaded not guilty. Lloyd's family also filed a wrongful death suit against Hernandez in December, according to Kevin Phelan, the family's attorney. Hernandez is also named in another civil suit. A man that sources have described as Hernandez's ""muscle man,"" Alexander Bradley, has filed a civil lawsuit accusing Hernandez of shooting him in the face during an argument after they left a Florida strip club in February 2013. Bradley lost sight in one eye because of the shooting, according to the lawsuit. CNN's attempts to reach Hernandez's attorney were unsuccessful.","The former NFL star is being held on first-degree murder charge in death of Odin Lloyd .

"By the late 1960s, Bill Cosby was a married man well on his way to having five children, not to mention a landmark career in stand-up comedy, television and beyond. He was also no stranger to Playboy. Now that connection is among those coming back to him, as more and more women -- at least 21, by CNN's count -- accuse him of sexual misconduct.

Among Cosby's accusers is Judy Huth, who recently sued Cosby alleging he sexually molested her at the Playboy Mansion when she was 15 years old. Another woman who worked as a server, or ""bunny,"" at a Playboy club accused Cosby of forcibly kissing her, and a former Playboy playmate alleged he drugged and raped her. And, P.J. Masten, one of the two ex-bunnies who have publicly accused Cosby of sexual assault, told CNN's Alisyn Camerota that there are other women who have not come forward, or will not. ""(There are) 12 former bunnies that I know of that are ashamed to come forward, frightened to come forward, married with families (and) don't want to come forward."" Masten said. ""But they were also drugged and raped by Bill Cosby."" Cosby's camp didn't respond to a CNN request for comment on Masten's allegation, though his lawyer has repeatedly and strongly denied such accusations in recent weeks. Notably, too, none of the accusers is known to have immediately gone to law enforcement, nor has Cosby been ever charged with a crime. As to Playboy, Masten says she told her supervisor soon after she claimed Cosby had drugged and raped her at a Chicago hotel. ""She said to me, 'You know that's Hef's best friend, right?'"" Masten recounted, referring to Playboy founder Hugh Hefner. ""I said, 'Yes.' She said, 'Well, nobody is going to believe you. I suggest you keep your mouth shut.'"" Hefner responded to the allegations in a statement Friday, saying ""Bill Cosby has been a good friend for many years and the mere thought of these allegations is truly saddening. I would never tolerate this kind of behavior, regardless of who was involved."" The new accusations could further sully the reputation of Cosby -- the man behind children's programming like ""Fat Albert"" and ""Little Bill,"" and whose eponymous No. 1 sitcom, ""The Cosby Show,"" cast him as a wisecracking, doting family man. Cosby facing litany of allegations . Ex-bunny: 'I was raped' at Chicago hotel . Open the centerfold of a Playboy magazine, and you might glimpse a ""playmate"" oftentimes nude and sometimes living or near Hefner's mansion in Los Angeles. P.J. Masten was a ""bunny."" Or, in other words, she was a waitress -- albeit one in 3-inch high heels, 5-inch bunny ears and a tight-fitting costume. She was in her 20s when, in 1972, she began working at a Playboy club in northern New Jersey. Masten would end up working at similar clubs in Los Angeles and Chicago. It was in Chicago that Cosby invited her out to lunch one afternoon, even jumping behind the counter to make hot dogs. ""Everybody was in there laughing,"" Masten recalled. ""It was a lot of fun."" The comedian called the next day, asking her out to dinner and to meet her at the Whitehall Hotel. Masten went up to his room -- not suspicious at all, she said -- and four of Cosby's friends were with him watching sports, smoking cigars and playing cards. Cosby asked Masten if she wanted a cocktail before dinner, preparing a glass of Grand Marnier and ice behind her. She took it and drank it, she said. ""The next thing I knew, it was 4 o'clock in the morning,"" she alleged. ""I woke up in a bed naked, bruised. He was laying next to me, and I slithered out of the bed... I got myself together, I went downstairs, I got in a cab, and I went home."" Asked by CNN's Camerota what she think happened, Masten didn't hesitate. ""There were bruise marks all over me,"" she claimed. ""I knew I was raped."" Cosby challenged to meet accusers in court or set aside $100 million . Several other public accusers with Playboy connection . Masten said she's been in therapy for years, trying to salve her emotional wounds. But it's only now, about four decades later, that she's decided to come public -- feeling compelled to act after hearing about Huth. ""That was it for me,"" Masten said. ""This man has to be held accountable. He's a serial rapist. He's been that way since the '60s."" Huth's story also has a Playboy connection. In her lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, she claims that Cosby met her and a 16-year-old friend when he was filming a movie in the Southern California city's Lacy Park. He invited them to his tennis club, serving them alcoholic beverages there, then took them to the Playboy Mansion, according to the lawsuit. Huth claims Cosby sexually molested her after she came out of a bathroom there, alleging his actions were ""malicious, oppressive and fraudulent."" The comedian's lawyer, Martin D. Singer, has since filed a pleading calling Huth's claims ""absolutely false"" and accusing her of attempted extortion. Another accuser, Carla Ferrigno, says she was an 18-year-old Playboy bunny when she went with a male friend to Cosby's Beverly Hills home in 1967 and kissed her roughly after her date left the room. Playboy playmate Victoria Valentino says a friend introduced her to Cosby hoping to help her get work on his show ""I Spy"" in the late 1960s. She alleges he gave her pills at dinner to ""cheer up,"" after which she felt ""stoned"" as he took her to another place. There, Valentino said Cosby pushed himself near her mouth, before turning her around and raping her. Asked by CNN why she didn't speak out about the incident until recently, Valentino said, ""As a playmate, I thought, who would believe me?"" Cosby thanks defenders on Twitter . Lots of talk among Playboy bunnies . Masten is convinced there are other women with ties to Playboy who have similar stories. She said Cosby has come up at a recent reunion of Playboy bunnies, as well as in blogs and Facebook pages restricted to them. The public allegations stirred up lots of private conversations, involving a number of women, Masten says. ""A couple of (them) private messaged me and said, 'He did me too. It happened to me, too.'""","P.J. Masten says she was a Playboy bunny when she met comedian Bill Cosby .

"Apple will begin manufacturing a computer in the United States next year, says CEO Tim Cook, marking a shift in perhaps the most-criticized element of the company's beloved gadget empire. ""We've been working for years on doing more and more in the United States,"" Cook said in an interview with Brian Williams on NBC's ""Rock Center,"" scheduled to air Thursday night. ""Next year, we will do one of our existing Mac lines in the United States."" Cook did not say which computer he was talking about, but some models of the new iMac have been arriving stamped ""Assembled in the U.S.A,"" prompting speculation that it may be the company's flagship desktop. An Apple spokesman told CNN that Apple will be investing $100 million in the move. He downplayed the iMac speculation, though, saying Apple has always done some assembly of its computers in the United States and calling the stamps on some 21-inch iMacs ""coincidental as part of this story."" Cook shelled out additional details in an interview with Businessweek. He said Apple would not necessarily be the manufacturer of these computer components, ""but we'll be working with people, and we'll be investing our money."" In recent years Apple has come under sometimes withering criticism for its supply chain in China, both for shipping U.S. jobs overseas and for the working conditions at plants run by the companies Apple contracts with there. Former Apple CEO Steve Jobs, who died last year, avoided addressing the supply chain issue in public. But Cook has taken a different tack. He visited China in March to tour a factory owned by Foxconn, which makes electronics for Apple and other companies. And he allowed the Fair Labor Association to do a thorough audit of conditions at the Chinese factories, vowing to improve pay and hours. Cook told NBC that Apple isn't concerned about the higher cost of manufacturing in the United States creating pressure to raise prices. Apple assembled many of its products in the United States until the late 1990s, when it exported that work to Asia where labor costs are lower. ""It's not so much about price, it's about the skills, etc.,"" he told NBC's Williams. ""Over time, there are skills that are associated with manufacturing that have left the United States. Not necessarily people, but the education system has just stopped producing that. It's a concerted effort to get them back."" Cook acknowledged to Businessweek that the move is influenced, at least in part, by a desire to bolster a U.S. unemployment rate that, while slowly rebounding, still hovers around 8%. ""I don't think we have a responsibility to create a certain kind of job,"" Cook said. ""But I think we do have a responsibility to create jobs."" In both interviews, Cook emphasized American jobs Apple has already helped create -- from the companies that make components of its popular iPhone to the developers who have built businesses creating apps for Apple mobile devices. ""The engine in here is made in America,"" Cook said, holding up an iPhone. ""And not only are the engines in here made in America, but engines are made in America and exported.  The glass on this phone is made in Kentucky. So, we've been working for years on doing more and more in the United States."" As large as it may sound, a $100 million investment remains a relatively small chunk of Apple's estimated $120 billion cash on hand. It follows other limited steps by electronics companies. Apple's not the first major tech player to shift a portion of its manufacturing to the states. Lenovo, the world's second-largest PC maker, announced in October that it's starting a production line in North Carolina, creating 115 new jobs making laptops, desktops, tablets and other products. It's scheduled to open early next year. And earlier this year, Google began making its Nexus Q media streamer at a Texas plant -- although that ill-fated device has had a rocky run. Five months after it was unveiled, the Q's page in the Google Play store says it is ""not for sale at this time."" Late last year, an analysis by the Boston Consulting Group predicted that 2015 will be a ""tipping point"" when many tech industries will begin manufacturing in the United States. ""A surprising amount of work that rushed to China over the past decade could soon start to come back -- and the economic impact could be significant,"" said Harold L. Sirkin, a senior partner and lead author of the analysis. ""We're on record predicting a U.S. manufacturing renaissance starting by around 2015.""","Apple CEO Tim Cook: Apple will start making a computer in the United States .

"A van plowed into shoppers at an outdoor Christmas market Monday in Nantes, France, injuring at least nine people in addition to the driver, police said. Four had serious wounds, plus the driver, police said. The driver stabbed himself twice after the incident, but is expected to survive, said Pierre-Henry Brandet, a spokesman for France's Interior Ministry. French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve will head to Nantes Monday evening to meet with the families of the victims and rescue officials, Brandet told CNN affiliate BFM-TV. The investigation is just beginning, he said, but so far the Nantes prosecutor has said the incident appears to be an isolated case and not a terrorist attack. Authorities are investigating a notebook found with the attacker, Brandet said. It was not immediately clear whether the incident was related to one Sunday in Dijon, France, in which witnesses said a man shouting ""God is great"" in Arabic rammed his vehicle into pedestrians. At least 12 people were injured by that vehicle, said police in Dijon, a city in eastern France. A man has been arrested in connection with the case, they said. BFM-TV reported that eyewitnesses heard the driver shout the phrase ""Allahu Akbar"" -- Arabic for ""God is great."" On Saturday, a man stabbed three police officers in central France while allegedly calling out the same phrase. French counterterrorism authorities are investigating that attack. And France's Prime Minister said earlier Monday that his country has never faced as serious a terrorism threat as it does right now. Police haven't revealed any possible motives in the vehicle incidents.","The driver stabbed himself twice after the incident, but is expected to survive .

"In an embarrassing blow to its perception from an increasingly skeptical public, the Nigerian military Thursday retracted a report that nearly all the 129 school  girls kidnapped by suspected Boko Haram militants had been released. Just hours after a parent of an abducted girl claimed the Defense Ministry lied Wednesday about all but eight girls finding freedom, the director of defense said the initial report was ""not intended to deceive the public."" Maj. Gen. Chris Olukolade's statement didn't indicate how many of the girls were still unaccounted for. ""The number of those still missing is not the issue now as the life of every Nigerian is very precious,"" it said. 'Blatant lie' Distraught parents have waited for news for four days, putting their faith in a military rescue, said Lawan Zanna, father of one of the students. They are shocked that the government resorted to ""blatant propaganda"" and a ""blatant lie,"" he said. Olukolade said the military received a ""major breakthrough"" report from a reliable source who supposedly included information from the principal of the school where the students were seized by gunmen Monday night. But the principal denied releasing any information. ""I never made that claim to anybody,"" said Asabe Kwambura, principal of Government Girls Secondary School in the northeastern town of Chibok. ""A total of 14 out of the 129 students taken away managed to escape and the rest are still being held by their captors."" Olukolade called the misinformation an ""unfortunate development indeed."" How many are still missing? Musa Inuwa Kubo, the Borno state education commissioner, said Thursday that 30 students had come home. But the principal and Zanna each put the number at 14. Three girls escaped their captors Wednesday and were returned home by herdsmen, Zanna said. Others escaped from a broken truck as the abductors stopped, he said. The military said ""ongoing frantic efforts"" of security forces, vigilante groups and hunters are attempting to find and free the students. Rescue teams, aided by surveillance helicopters, were moving deeper into the vast forest that extends into neighboring Cameroon,  said Ali Ndume, a senator representing southern Borno state. A broken-down truck believed to have been part of the kidnappers' convoy was found at the edge of the forest, which suggests the abductors took their hostages into the woods on foot, he added. We 'ran into the bush' The incident began Monday night, when militants engaged in a gunbattle with guards at the boarding school, and then herded the students onto vehicles and drove off, authorities said. ""They left with us in a convoy into the bush,"" said one girl who escaped, but, citing security concerns, declined to identify herself. ""A group of motorcyclists flanked the convoy to ensure none of us escaped."" When a truck broke down, the girls inside were transferred to another truck and the broken one was set afire, the girl said. Another vehicle then broke down and, as the men tried to fix it, ""some of us jumped out of the vehicles and ran into the bush,"" she said. ""We later found our way back to Chibok."" Boko Haram means ""Western education is sin""  in the local Hausa language. The Islamist militant group is waging a campaign of violence in northeastern Nigeria, particularly in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa states. The militant group has bombed schools, churches and mosques; kidnapped women and children; and assassinated politicians and religious leaders alike. Human Rights Watch says more than 3,000 people have been killed in Boko Haram-related violence in the past five years. Armed militant groups in Nigeria's northeastern region are nothing new, but Boko Haram has taken the violence to unprecedented levels since 2009. In early March, Borno closed its 85 secondary schools and sent more than 120,000 students home after increasing attacks by the group. Chibok is in Borno state. Borno is one of three states under a state of emergency since mid-May. Britain offers help . UNICEF has called for the girls' ""immediate and unconditional release"" and said  attacks on Nigerian schools are getting out of control. British Foreign Secretary William Hague was among the world leaders condemning the kidnappings. ""We stand ready to provide assistance to help the Nigerian government ensure that these children can be returned to their families in safety, and to bring to justice those responsible"" for the ""cowardly act,"" he said.","Parents accuse the military of lying about the number of girls who are free .

"At least four people died and 14 were wounded Sunday by an explosion on a tourist bus in the Egyptian resort town of Taba, authorities said. Brig. Gen. Alaa Mahmoud said 33 tourists from South Korea were on the bus and had visited the Greek Orthodox Monastery of St. Catherine's, in the Sinai Peninsula. The bus was headed to Israel and was waiting in line near a border crossing, he said. According to state-run media, Health Ministry officials said three tourists and the bus driver, who was from Egypt, were killed. The jihadist group Ansar Jerusalem posted a statement on the radical Islamist website Hanein claiming responsibility for the bombing. Israeli police dispatched ambulances and patrol cars to the border with Egypt to help if needed, Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told CNN. Egypt's Minister of Tourism Hesham Zaazou said the Egyptian government had taken the ""utmost measures"" to protect tourists in the country. ""I'm extremely enraged because of this terrorist attack and this tragic incident,"" he told CNN by phone as he was traveling to the bombing site. The Sinai region has seen Islamist militants become more active in recent years. In January, three soldiers were killed when armed men attacked their bus. And in November, a car bomb killed 10 soldiers. The Egyptian revolution that toppled strongman President Hosni Mubarak in 2011 brought a resurgence of Islamists, whom his military regime had repressed for decades. This included relatively moderate factions like the Muslim Brotherhood, which swept into power when Mohamed Morsy became president in Egypt's first democratic elections. But it also included extremists, some who have been inspired by al Qaeda. In the Sinai Peninsula, they have called for the establishment of an Islamist caliphate. The Egyptian military began cracking down on them again. In July, when the military ousted Morsy in a coup, Islamist extremists in the Sinai saw it as an attack against Islam and stepped up their assaults, particularly against soldiers and military installations. Sunday's targeting of tourists marks a new threshold in Egyptian terror, at least in recent years. Taba is in the northeastern Sinai Peninsula, just a few miles from Israel. It was also the scene of a triple bombing in 2004, when 34 people were killed at hotels that were attacked. The explosion happened so close to the border that a security camera on the Israeli side caught it on tape. Israeli TV network Channel 2, a CNN affiliate, showed the video, which captures the explosion and its initial white smoke on the side of the frame.

"(CNN)CNN's guide to all things Equestrian at the London Olympics. Dressage . Dressage has been featured in the Olympics for a century now, and yet, for all its history many spectators are baffled by the allure of a horse prancing about in a ring to music. Unlike some of the more flashy Olympic sports, you won't find glitter, spandex or bulging muscles here -- save of course for those on the horse. Dressage is an exercise in restraint, in beauty of form and synergy between horse and rider. Here are some things to keep in mind while watching. Less is More . Once the horse and rider enter the ring, all movement should come from the horse. The less the rider appears to be doing, the better the score. To the casual eye it may seem like the horse is doing all the work, but the rider is using every part of their body -- even minute shifts in weight -- to guide each movement of their mount. Attitude . Dressage has its roots in the military training of elite officers and their horses, dating back hundreds of years. This has had a direct effect on the rider's attire, but it is also reflected in the judging of the horse. Look for calm horses with floppy ears and a relaxed demeanor. Judges mark down for signs of a foul temper- which includes pinned ears, constant tail swishing, and foaming lips, which indicate the horse is not listening to the bit in its mouth. All the latest Equestrian news here . Beat . Tempo and rhythm are the keys to a great dressage performance. Each step should fall in a rhythm and as the horse takes strides it should fall into a tempo. Dressage is often called ballet for horses, look for the horse that has the best beat and you may find a winner. Show Jumping . Show jumping is one of the more dangerous Olympic sports and it can also be one of the most exciting. Unlike dressage where the horse stays grounded, show jumping involves navigating a course of jumps often as wide as they are tall, without taking longer than the allotted time. First Impressions . To the trained eye, an observer can tell a lot about a horse and a rider as soon as they enter the ring. How many sets of reins is the rider holding? How many rings are on the side of the bit in the horse's mouth? If the answer is more than one, it can often mean the horse is as temperamental as it is talented. Speed Up to Slow Down . For a show jumper, faults come from taking extra time but can also be caused by errors when being too hasty. A horse cannot jump from a gallop because all their energy is focused forward and down. The energy to jump comes from the hind end of the horse- notice how the riders rock their horses back onto their hindquarters in front of successful jumps. Jumping a clear course -- no poles knocked down -- requires navigating the balance of when to flat out gallop and when to collect and slow down. No Route . In show jumping there is no set route, only a list of jumps to be cleared in order coming from an assigned direction. This means that it is the rider's job to decide how they will get from one jump to the next. Tight turns and inside routes mean seconds off the clock, but can result in crashes and missteps if the horse doesn't have time to see where it is going.","Germany's Michael Jung won gold in the individual eventing .

"Yasser Jad has a dream to open a fine dining cookery school in Saudi Arabia. He founded the Saudi Arabian Chefs Association three years ago to create a network among his country's best cooks and encourage them to improve their skills and now has 270 members. But he believes there's more to do in developing fine dining. Jad himself trained at Le Cordon Bleu in Paris and is now in charge of in-flight catering at Saudi Arabian Airlines. ""Most Saudi chefs begin without proper training,"" said Jad. ""We have some courses but they don't take people to the level they need. ""As a result young chefs aren't surviving long in the market. They are leaving the industry after two or three years because they don't get paid a lot and the competition is so high. ""I wish everybody could have proper training."" Saudi Arabia's food scene is quickly becoming more varied -- and healthier -- as it incorporates influences from around the world, Jad said. ""Saudis have traditionally eaten too much lamb and not enough salad or vegetables,"" he said. ""But that's changing. People are mixing more ingredients with influences from Asia, North America, the Mediterranean and all over the Middle East."" Jad appeared as a judge on the Middle Eastern version of the American reality show Top Chef when it was launched by LBC, the Lebanese broadcaster, last year. The winner of the series was Omar El Ghoul, a Moroccan-born chef who works in Saudi Arabia as executive chef at Delifrance, the international bakery chain. The prominence of fast food franchises is one of the issues that bothers Emanuele Esposito, an Italian chef who has worked in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, for six years. ""The country has developed a lot in food and hospitality, but there's still a lot of American influence and fast food,"" said Esposito. ""There are four million people in Jeddah and only two or three fine dining restaurants, but probably 100 branches of fast food franchises."" Like Jad, Esposito wants to open a hospitality school to help develop young chefs. ""A lot of the younger Saudis want to improve their skills,"" said Esposito. ""I'm working with the Chamber of Commerce in Jeddah, but it takes time. Hopefully we will open later this year."" Esposito is executive chef at Il Villagio Restaurant in Jeddah, which was Highly Commended in the Fine Dining Restaurant Category of last year's Saudi Excellence in Tourism Awards. When Esposito first moved to Saudi Arabia, he only planned to stay a couple of years, but six years later he has no plans to leave. ""There are more restaurants opening all the time. Alongside the Saudi and Middle Eastern restaurants, there are Italian restaurants and Japanese has really taken off in the last few years."" One person taking advantage of that boom is food lover Rashed Islam. He started a food blog in 2006 and developed it into full eating out website called JeddahFood.com in 2008. He now has 56,000 Facebook followers, almost 14,000 registered users, 31,000 unique monthly users and 28,000 downloads of his iPhone app. The website, which has a recently launched Riyadh version, RiyadhEats.com, provides restaurant listings, news and user reviews. ""I love eating and entertainment in Saudi is quite limited, so dining out became important for me socially,"" said Islam, 29. ""Before we launched, Saudi Arabia didn't have any forum for people to review and recommend restaurants."" Islam, who employs a staff of six, says Jeddah has a vibrant restaurant scene with foods from all around the world. ""It's a multi-cultural city and the gateway to Mecca and Medina, which shows in the food,"" he said. ""From sushi to Indonesian, Italian and Lebanese food, it mirrors a lot of the trends from Paris, London and New York."" Islam's favourite food, however, is from closer to home, the Arabic dish of ful medames, made from mashed fava beans with olive oil, chopped parsley, onion, garlic and lemon juice.","Too many restaurants in Saudi Arabia are fast food chains, say chefs there .

"For almost 30 years, Abdullah Ocalan called for his people to wage war against the Turkish state. On Thursday, the imprisoned founder of the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party made a historic call for dialogue with the government, as a letter from Ocalan  was read in the Turkish Parliament. ""We for tens of years gave up our lives for this stuggle, we paid a price. We have come to a point at which the guns must be silent and ideas must talk,"" said the letter, read by Sirri Sureyya Onder of the pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party, known as the BDP. ""I say in the witnesss of millions, a new period is beginning -- one in which not the gun, but politics is in the lead,"" the letter continued. ""I say we have come to a point at which our armed elements should pull out of the borders. This is not giving up our struggle, it is about starting a new phase of struggle."" After decades of bloodshed from both sides that have cost tens of thousands of lives since 1984, there have been other recent signs of reconciliation. In his ten years in power, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has loosened restrictions on expressions of Kurdish culture, which were forbidden for decades as being un-Turkish. Hostages released . Over a week ago, Kurdish rebels handed over eight Turkish hostages in northern Iraq in a gesture of good will. ""This shows that there can be a democratic solution to the Kurdish issue,"" said Adil Kurt, a Parliament member from the BDP. He went to Iraq to help pick up the hostages and bring them back to Turkey. The Kurdistan Workers' Party -- known by its initials in Kurdish, PKK -- is expected to begin leaving Turkish territory. It could announce that its armed wing will eventually lay down its weapons. Counterdemands are not yet known, but the PKK in the past has insisted upon collective rights as an ethnic group, which are anchored in a new constitution, as well as a degree of autonomy in governing Kurdish areas. Kurds are a nation without a nation.  The ethnic group, with its own languages and customs, straddles the borders of Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey. Kurds are a sizable minority and make up nearly 20% of the population of Turkey. The bloody conflict . Starting in 1984, Ocalan called for the PKK to carry out bloody attacks  in retaliation against cultural suppression, particularly attempts to stamp out the Kurdish language.  His ultimate goal has been the formation of a Kurdish state in Turkey's rural southeast, which has a predominantly Kurdish population. The campaign resulted in countless bombings, armed attacks, and hunger strikes. Kurdish protesters demanding autonomy have also often set themselves on fire in public places. The PKK, which has a Marxist-Leninist philosophy, at first carried out attacks in rural areas but moved into cities in the 1990s and expanded to include Turkish diplomatic interests in Western Europe, according to the U.S. State Department. By 1998 it counted up to 15,000 guerrillas and had thousands of sympathizers in Europe. The PKK also bombed hotels and kidnapped tourists to damage Turkey's booming tourism industry, the State Department said. Human rights organizations have accused Turkish security forces of summarily executing Kurds and allowing others to die in custody, as well as the additional killings of thousands of Kurds. Human Rights Watch has called for the prosecution of those involved. After the fall of dictator Saddam Hussein in neighboring Iraq, ethnic Kurds in Turkey's north have gained more autonomy and prosperity.  The PKK has operated out of the region. Iraq refused the Turkish government's requests to intervene. Turkey's military has gone after rebel pockets in Iraq's north with aerial shelling. The Turkish government has declared the PKK a terror organization, as has its ally the United States.","Letter from imprisoned leader of Kurdish militant group is read in Turkish Parliament .

"French President Francois Hollande said he and France's first lady were going through ""painful moments,"" as he faced questions Tuesday over an alleged affair with an actress. In his first appearance before the media since the allegations surfaced in the French tabloid Closer linking Hollande romantically to actress Julie Gayet,  the President was immediately asked about his personal life when he handed the floor to journalists following a nearly 40-minute speech. Asked whether his partner, Valerie Trierweiler, was still the first lady of France, Hollande said personal affairs should be dealt with in private. ""Everybody in their personal lives can go through hardships. This is the case for us,"" he said. ""These are painful moments, but I have one principle: Private affairs are dealt with in private. This is not the place nor the time to do this."" Hollande and Trierweiler are expected next month on a state visit to the United States at the invitation of President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle. Their itinerary includes a February 11 state dinner at the White House. Speaking at the Elysee Palace to outline his new-year plans for the economy, Hollande said he would clarify the situation before the February trip. The allegations, which emerged Friday, have sparked a media firestorm of a kind not usually seen in France, where privacy is closely guarded. Trierweiler was hospitalized shortly after the report appeared. ""Catastrophic scenario"" According to French national daily Le Monde, Hollande's news conference -- the first of 2014 and only his third in office -- was supposed to be a chance for the embattled leader, who has seen his popularity slump since his 2012 election, to relaunch his agenda. Instead, it is a ""catastrophic scenario,"" the newspaper reported -- with him trying to deal with questions about his private life as briefly as possible and turn the focus back to economic matters. Jean-Francois Cope, leader of the opposition UMP, told television channel France 5 over the weekend that the allegations were ""disastrous for the image of the presidential office,"" adding that the story was dominating international media coverage of France. Former Prime Minister Alain Juppe, also of the UMP, is quoted by CNN affiliate BFMTV as saying that ""many people overseas who specialize in 'French bashing' are having a field day."" Asked if there should be moves to formalize the position of the first lady -- in contrast to the United States, the partner of the French president has no defined status -- Juppe said that might not be the solution. ""In France, we love status. We can create a status for the first lady and for the second lady as well, perhaps,"" he joked. Hospitalization . Patrice Biancone, head of Trierweiler's Elysee office, told CNN on Sunday the first lady had been hospitalized since Friday. He said she ""needed rest"" and he hoped she would leave the hospital early this week. ""We all know why she went in after the story came out,"" said Biancone, clearly making the link between the revelations of the magazine and Trierweiler's hospitalization. Hollande, 59, left his longtime common-law wife, Segolene Royal -- the mother of his four children -- for Trierweiler, 48, before the 2012 presidential election. The two are not married but live together, and she makes official state appearances. They met when Trierweiler was a reporter for Paris Match magazine. She still works for the publication. Right to privacy . Hollande did not tackle the claims in the Closer article head-on as he announced ideas to tackle unemployment and measures such as deep public spending cuts to boost economic growth, which he said had to be ""as vigorous as possible."" The story has however prompted questions in French media about Hollande's right to privacy, whether his security may have been jeopardized during his alleged liaisons, and Trierweiler's future status as first lady. Closer reported that Hollande had been slipping out of the back door of the Elysee Palace and hopping on a motor scooter driven by a bodyguard to Gayet's apartment. The magazine also said the bodyguard brought croissants to the apartment one morning. Asked whether his security was jeopardized in this case, the President said, ""My security is insured everywhere and all times. Privately I go around with less security. People should not worry."" Hollande has not confirmed or denied the alleged affair but has threatened legal action. A statement from his entourage Friday to news agency Agence France-Presse said Hollande ""deeply condemns the attacks on the right to privacy which he has a right to like every other citizen."" A survey last month by French polling organization Ifop gave Hollande an approval rating of 22%, a rise of 2 percentage points from the previous month, when he hit a record low. Hollande, who was elected after campaigning to put growth before austerity and introduce higher taxes on the rich, has been urged by his European partners and international institutions to be bolder with his economic reforms. France's faltering economic performance last year, accompanied by stubbornly high unemployment figures, led to fears the second-biggest economy in the eurozone could act as a brake on the region's fragile recovery.","Francois Hollande says he'll clarify status of first lady before February trip to U.S.

"Serie A side Napoli have completed the signing of Argentine international Gonzalo Higuain from Real Madrid. A statement on the Spanish club's website published Saturday confirmed that the 25-year-old striker was on his way to Italy. ""Real Madrid C. F. announces that Gonzalo Higuain has been transferred to Naples,"" read the statement. ""The club would like to express their gratitude for his years of dedication and professionalism, and wishes him luck in this new step."" Higuain, who is reported to have cost Napoli in the region of $50 million, spent six-and-a-half seasons at the Bernabeu and scored a total of 107 goals in 187 appearances. The Argentine joins a growing list of new signings as Napoli's new manager Rafa Benitez prepares for an assault on both the Serie A title and the Champions League. Striker Jose Callejon and defender Raul Albiol both joined the Italian club from Madrid earlier this month while Belgian international winger Dries Mertens signed from Dutch club PSV Eindhoven in June. Benitez has also signed Liverpool goalkeeper Jose Reina on a one-year loan deal. Higuain is expected to fill the void left by last season's top scorer in Serie A Edinson Cavani. The Uruguayan striker, who scored 29 goals for Napoli last term, joined French champions Paris Saint Germain earlier this month in a deal worth a French record €64 million ($84 million).","Argentine striker moves to Serie A following six-and-a-half years at the Bernabeu .

"Michael Brown's family attorneys support Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon's call for peaceful protests once the a grand jury rules in Officer Darren Wilson's case, but they also had some words of admonition for him Thursday. The family implored that would-be protesters refrain from the looting and violence that marred the early protests in Ferguson, Missouri, said attorney Anthony Gray. Such behavior diminishes the opportunities for healing and derails productive dialogue, he said. It's equally important, though, to implore that authorities use ""reasonable restraints"" in dealing with protesters, the attorney said. He went on to blame assault rifles, manhandling, tear gas, rubber bullets and false arrests for agitating the protesters who took to the streets after Wilson shot and killed Brown on August 9. ""These acts of violence impacted innocent men, women and children simply exercising their rights,"" Gray said, adding, ""A strong message of zero tolerance should have been conveyed to all."" Many observers have expressed concern that if Wilson is not indicted, chaos could ensue in Ferguson and beyond. Nixon this week vowed to crack down on any ""ugliness,"" and some criticized the governor for directing his remarks only at protesters. Though the grand jury technically has until January to issue its decision, the ruling is expected in mid-November -- any day now. Gray did not provide specifics on when the ruling might come other than to say, ""We're probably getting to the end of the witness list."" At the news conference in front of a St. Louis County courthouse in Clayton, attorney Benjamin Crump, who also represents the Browns, reiterated Gray's call for calm and, in a remark directed at law enforcement, said, ""We would like to thank you in advance for not having a repeat of the horrific events that happened in August."" Crump declined to discuss a widely reported story that famed pathologist Michael Baden, who is in the Brown family's employ, was testifying before the grand jury, other than to say the prosecutor's office extended the invitation to testify and Baden will provide ""insightful analysis"" that will help the grand jury make its decision. Asked if revealing Baden's testimony jeopardized the secrecy on which grand jury proceedings rely, Crump repeated an oft-uttered assertion: He believes there was sufficient probable cause to arrest Wilson and provide him due process transparently rather than via a closed-door grand jury hearing. ""Historically, they're going to do whatever the prosecutor wants them to do,"" Crump said of the grand jury. Police union attorney: ""It's not about taking a side"" The Brown family's attorneys spoke about an hour after the attorney for the St. Louis Police Officers Association told CNN that when it comes down to Wilson and Brown, ""it's not about taking a side."" Conversations about race and how police officers conduct themselves didn't begin after Wilson killed the unarmed teenager, said Neil Bruntrager, general counsel for the labor organization, in a brief interview. ""It's a fallacy to assume this all just happened on August 9. There's a lot of history here, both good and bad,"" he said. ""It won't finish when the grand jury comes back. There's a lot left to be done."" And it isn't about standing behind either Brown or Wilson, he said, not even when it comes to the labor organization representing St. Louis police. ""Their position is, 'Look, justice is a process.' They support the process,"" Bruntrager said. ""It's not about taking a side. It's about understanding the process, and they do. And they encourage everyone -- everyone -- to pay attention to that process because it is something that people can trust."" Asked if the union knew Wilson's side of the story -- the grand jury consideration of which has left Ferguson and the surrounding area on edge -- Bruntrager said it did not. ""What they know, of course, is what everyone has read in the newspapers, and they're in a position where they, like everyone else, are waiting until the grand jury makes a decision,"" the attorney said. He would not comment on whether he felt Wilson would be indicted. Ahead of what they fear could be violence in the wake of the ruling, authorities have said they've been in constant discussions to prepare for the response that may follow the grand jury ruling. A community group called the Don't Shoot Coalition has issued 19 so-called rules of engagement in hopes of deterring the heavy-handed response for which police were vehemently criticized in the weeks after Brown's shooting. Bruntrager praised efforts to keep police and protesters safe and said the dialogue is important. ""People have tried to understand what the rage is about.

"(CNN) -- Social media users who denounce drug cartel activities along the Mexican border received a brutal warning this week: Two mangled bodies hanging like cuts of meat from a pedestrian bridge. A woman was hogtied and disemboweled, her intestines protruding from three deep cuts on her abdomen. Attackers left her topless, dangling by her feet and hands from a bridge in the border city of Nuevo Laredo. A bloodied man next to her was hanging by his hands, his right shoulder severed so deeply the bone was visible. Signs left near the bodies declared the pair, both apparently in their early 20s, were killed for posting denouncements of drug cartel activities on a social network. ""This is going to happen to all of those posting funny things on the Internet,"" one sign said. ""You better (expletive) pay attention. I'm about to get you."" The gruesome scene sent a chilling message at a time when online posts have become some of the loudest voices reporting violence in Mexico. In some parts of the country, threats from cartels have silenced traditional media. Sometimes even local authorities fear speaking out. Mexico's notoriously ruthless drug gangs regularly hang victims from bridges and highway overpasses. And bloggers who specialize in sharing news about trafficking have been threatened in the past. But this could be the first time users of such social networks have been targeted. Investigator Ricardo Mancillas Castillo said he had not encountered a threat against Internet users in his four years based in Nuevo Laredo. But the signs of torture -- the cuts, the disembowelment -- were along the lines of what officials are used to seeing in drug-related violence. In the case of the two victims found on the Nuevo Laredo bridge Tuesday, their ears and fingers were mutilated, said Mancillas, who works for the public prosecutor's office. There are no witnesses, and it is a nearly impossible task to identify the perpetrators, he said. Thirty-six hours had passed since the bodies were found Tuesday morning, but no one had come to claim them and they remained unidentified, Mancillas said. It will be nearly impossible to determine if the two victims actually posted anything about cartels on the Internet, as people don't usually use their real names online, he said. The placards threatened those who report violent incidents through social media networks. It listed two blogs by name, Al Rojo Vivo and Blog del Narco. They were signed ""Z,"" a possible reference for the Zetas cartel, which operates in the area. Blog del Narco is a website that deals exclusively with news related to drug violence in Mexico. Its creator remains anonymous. On the Al Rojo Vivo forum, where citizens can make anonymous tips, one person wrote: ""Don't be afraid to denounce. It's very difficult for them to find out who denounced. They only want to scare society."" One Twitter user echoed that sense of defiance in light of the threats. ""Enough! If we shut up today, we will have lost the ground that we have gained. This is the time to show what we are made of,"" the owner of the @QuestoyQuelotro Twitter account wrote. In a statement sent to CNN, Blog del Narco said its site is not dedicated to denouncing crime, as are other sites. ""In addition, we are not in favor or against any criminal group, we only inform as things happen,"" the statement said. More than 34,600 people have died in drug-related violence since Mexican President Felipe Calderon announced a crackdown on cartels in December 2006, according to government statistics. Other reports have listed a higher toll. The latest Mexican government tally was released in January. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet, Rafael Romo and journalist Raul Llamas contributed to this report.","Signs say two people were killed for denouncing cartel activities on the Internet .

"(CNN)Got an idea on how to make a flying aircraft carrier? The Defense Department wants to know about it. The Defense Advanced Research Products Agency has a request out for ideas on how to develop an airborne platform that could both launch and recover other aircraft. But before you start looking for schematics of the Starship Enterprise (NCC-1701) or Battlestar Galactica, or how you might levitate the USS Nimitz, think a little smaller, like B-1, B-52 or C-130. DARPA wants ideas on how to turn those aircraft currently in the Pentagon inventory into platforms that could carry Unmanned Aerial Systems, what most folks call drones, close to their targets. The drones could then go about their business -- bombing, missile strikes, reconnaissance, etc. -- then fly back to the mother ship and head for home. This plan could add to the range of the drones and open up new missions they cannot now undertake because of their limited range, DARPA says. As you consider your ideas, DARPA says you have to keep the cost low and they'd like something they could demonstrate within four years. And don't get long-winded. Your proposal should fit on eight, standard 8.5- x 11-inch pages in 11-point type. And if you're worried your big plans will fall into the hands of your competitors, don't.

"Fort Lauderdale, Florida (CNN) -- A South Florida jury found former World Series hero Jim Leyritz guilty of driving drunk Saturday but acquitted him of a more serious charge of DUI manslaughter. An emotional Leyritz was handcuffed until the verdict was read, then went over to thank each of the six jurors and was later released on bond. The ex-baseball player could still face a maximum of six months in prison, but that's far short of the 15 years he could have faced for hitting and killing 30-year-old Freida Veitch while driving drunk. ""He's free,"" said his mother, Betty Leyritz. ""He is the most happy man now."" The verdict followed a busy Friday, the first day that the jury of five men and one woman began deliberations. Judge Marc H. Gold first tossed out a count of DUI manslaughter based on impairment, finding insufficient evidence for the charge to go to the jury. Later, at 6 p.m., the jury sent a note to Gold saying they had reached a stalemate. ""We have completely decided that we will not agree on this decision,"" the note said. ""How do we proceed?"" Gold asked the jurors to continue talking, and they deliberated for another hour Saturday before reaching a verdict. Three jurors said Saturday that they had only taken 45 minutes to decide to acquit Leyritz of manslaughter. A single juror -- Sharon Wessinger -- held out, wanting to also acquit him on the drunk driving charge, but she changed her mind Saturday. After the verdict, Leyritz came over to three of the jurors, talking to them and showing them pictures of his three sons, of whom he's the primary custodial parent. Wessingerthen explained to him her change of heart Saturday morning, in siding with the other jurors and convict him on the drunken driving charge. ""The thought of it going into another trial later and you possibly being convicted of manslaughter, when we weren't doing that, I couldn't let that happen,"" Wessinger said. Jury foreman Brian Haul told CNN's siter network TruTV that, while all six people quickly agreed Leyritz wasn't guilty of the greater charge, they felt compelled to hold him responsible on some grounds. ""Are we going to go in front the public and say it's OK to have four or five drinks within an hour or so period of time and then hit the road? I think that was the deciding factor,"" he said. Prosecution and defense will meet December 1, to settle on a sentencing date on the drunken driving charge. Until then, Leyritz is free on bond and required to breath into a device every time he gets behind the wheel. According to court documents, the incident began as a 2007 night-time celebration for Leyritz, who was ringing in his 44thbirthday with friends by bar-hopping in Fort Lauderdale. While driving a friend home shortly after 3 a.m. on December 28, 2007, his red 2006 Ford Expedition hit the vehicle of 30-year-old Freida Veitch. She was thrown from her dark green 2000 Mitsubishi Montero. Blood drawn from Leyritz three hours later showed he had 0.14 percent blood alcohol level, above the 0.08 legal limit in Florida. He also failed field sobriety tests, according to police. Veitch was also drunk -- with a 0.18 blood alcohol level -- and was not wearing her seat belt, according to court documents. Leyritz played 11 years in the major leagues, including all or parts of eight seasons with the New York Yankees. His career highlight came in 1996, when he hit a winning home run in game four of the World Series. He also hit pivotal homers during the 1995, 1998 and 1999 postseasons. He remained in the limelight after his career ended in 2000, appearing on national and New York-based radio programs. Leyritz admitted that he'd used amphetamines in his playing days. After his arrest, the twice-divorced Leyritz told truTV's In Session, he lost his job as a sports commentator and lost an endorsement deal, leaving him to rely on loans from friends and reporters. His girlfriend, Michelle Caruso, say Leyritz was ""terrified this morning,"" and happy about the verdict. ""He was worried about a hung jury,"" she said. ""I'm just so happy that his kids have their dad back."" In Session's Grace Wong contributed to this report.","A South Florida jury acquitted Jim Leyritz of DUI manslaughter .

"(CNN)Mitt Romney sparked a firestorm of criticism from Republicans when he announced his interest in running for president again, and now he's taking further friendly fire — from within his own circle of former aides. Two former top Romney campaign aides panned another Romney run, with one, Romney's former Florida campaign manager Brett Doster, backing Jeb Bush instead. Vin Weber, a co-chair for Romney's 2012 bid, told Bloomberg Politics in an interview that aired Thursday afternoon that he's not decided on who he'll support in 2016 and he's ""not happy"" about the former Massachusetts governor's reemergence onto the presidential politics scene. ""I'm not happy, frankly, with the way that he's chosen to re-enter presidential politics, and I think his friends need to be honest with him about that,"" he said. ""He's a great man, he would be a great president but there's not a lot of good precedent for somebody losing the election and coming back four years later and becoming the nominee."" Weber referenced former New York Gov. Thomas Dewey, who ran unsuccessfully for president three times and unexpectedly lost what many believed to be an easily winnable race in 1948 to Democratic President Harry Truman. ""It didn't work out too well,"" Weber said of that bid. And Doster said in an email reported by FloridaPolitics.com that ""Mitt Romney was a great leader for our party in 2012...but Jeb is my man, and Florida is Jeb Bush country.""

Romney's announcement to donors that he's seriously looking at another run for president shocked GOP leaders and operatives, including many of his former staffers and supporters. Some of Romney's top aides, however, are loudly on-board for another run. Eric Fehrnstrom, a longtime Romney aide and his top campaign advisor in 2012, tweeted out poll numbers showing Romney polling way ahead of the pack. Indeed, Romney's experienced a renaissance since losing to President Barack Obama in 2012, with his image rebounding and the GOP looking to him as a de-facto leader on many issues. But his interest in running for president has sparked a wide array of criticism, both from his potential rivals and some of the party's most prominent voices, including the Wall Street Journal editorial board.

"A San Antonio police officer denied allegations that he sexually assaulted a 19-year-old woman Friday night after pulling her over for a traffic violation. The ""allegations are false,"" Officer Jackie Len Neal told CNN Monday.  He added that he would meet with his attorney Monday and had no further comment. But San Antonio police say differently and are looking into possible similar accusations against Neal in the past. At 2 a.m. Saturday, police and Special Victims Unit detectives arrested Neal. ""The sexual assault which led to the arrest took place early Friday morning on the South Side, when Neal made a traffic stop on a 19-year-old woman.  Neal was in full uniform, in a marked patrol car, and on-duty when the sexual assault occurred,"" San Antonio Police spokesman Sgt. Javier Salazar said in a statement. ""The 40-year-old officer is an 11-year veteran and is assigned to South Patrol on the overnight shift.  He has been placed on Administrative Leave.""

"(CNN) -- Ugandan officials have recovered what they've described as an explosives-laden belt or vest in a trash can at a nightclub in a suburb of Kampala, the chief of police said Tuesday. Maj. Gen. Kale Kayihura, the chief of police, said the device -- found Monday -- was impregnated with ball bearings and was similar to those found at two sites where blasts killed at least 76 people Sunday. The device was found along with a detonator and what looked like a laptop bag, Kayihura said. When a journalist asked him whether this meant there was a third attack planned, he said, ""It's possible there was."" The police chief said that his office was working with international agencies -- but would not specify which ones. He also would not say how many people have been arrested in connection with the attacks and what their nationalities were. Earlier, Fred Opolot, executive director of the Uganda Media Center, said authorities had arrested several people but they have not yet been charged in connection with the attacks. ""We are trying to find the culprits of this atrocity,"" he said. ""I can't say I'm not worried, but it's not a question of worry,"" Kayihura said Tuesday. He said Uganda is no stranger to bombings -- ""for decades, we have been fighting."" The blasts went off Sunday at two venues -- a restaurant and a rugby field -- where crowds had gathered to watch the World Cup soccer finals. The fatalities included 28 Ugandans, one Irish citizen, one Indian, one American and 11 people who are either Ethiopian or Eritrean, according to the Ugandan government. In Washington, State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Tuesday the latest information indicates that 76 people were killed in the blasts.  He added that five Americans who were injured in the attacks were evacuated from Uganda over the past 24 hours -- two to South Africa and three to Kenya. He also said that the United States has diplomatic security agents on the ground in Uganda, along with a small number of FBI agents. ""I think the FBI is going to send a significant team... that will depart the United States this afternoon for Uganda at the request of Uganda authorities to assist in the investigation,"" Crowley said. A Somali Islamist militant movement on Monday claimed responsibility for the trio of bombings. ""And the best of men have promised and they have delivered,"" said an Arabic statement issued by Al-Shabaab's press office and obtained by CNN. ""Blessed and exalted among men -- (taking) full responsibility. ...We wage war against the 6,000 collaborators; they have received their response."" The 6,000 figure is an apparent reference to African Union peacekeepers in Somalia. Uganda contributes troops to the peacekeeping effort. ""We are behind the attack because we are at war with them,"" Al-Shabaab spokesman Ali Mohamoud Rage told reporters at a news conference in Mogadishu, Somalia. ""We had given warning to the Ugandans to refrain from their involvement in our country. We spoke to the leaders and we spoke to the people and they never listened to us,"" Rage said. Kayihura said he could not say whether Al-Shabaab's claim of responsibility is legitimate. That will be determined by the ongoing investigation, he said. Somali Prime Minister Omar Abdirashid Ali-Sharmarke called on the ""civilized world to unite in stopping the mindless terror enterprise of Al-Shabaab."" ""We will work with our partners in Uganda and the international community in bringing the cowards responsible for this heinous act,"" the prime minister said in a statement released Monday. Meanwhile, al Qaeda congratulated Al-Shabaab in a message posted on pro-jihad web forums. ""Be pleased because all the sincere Muslims are with you joining you in your moments of pleasure and difficulty,"" read part of the message. The blasts hit within 50 minutes of each other. The first one struck an Ethiopian restaurant in a neighborhood dotted with bars and popular among expatriates. Two others exploded at the rugby center. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni declared a week of national mourning for victims of the bombings, beginning Tuesday, according to a government statement. All flags on public buildings will be lowered to half-staff during the mourning period, the statement said.","NEW:  5 Americans injured in Sunday's attacks have been evacuated from Uganda .

"(CNN) -- Lewis Hamilton has always been driven by his emotions -- for better or for worse -- but has he found a new level of maturity with Mercedes? The double world champion has been schooled in the harsh lessons that Formula One can mete out since he joined McLaren's junior program when just 13 years old. But, despite this careful education by one of the most straight laced teams in F1, the British boy racer cannot help wearing his heart on his sleeve. There have been some heady highs and mesmerizing meltdowns in his eight-year career at the highest level of motorsport. Fizzing with energy, he bounded into the sport in 2007 and refused to lie down when faced with Fernando Alonso, a double world champion, as his feisty McLaren teammate. With Alonso gone after a single acrimonious season, Hamilton drove the McLaren to the 2008 title with ""my heart in my mouth."" At just 23 years old, he had sensationally clinched the championship at the last corner, of the last lap, of the last race to deny Ferrari's Felipe Massa -- and a seething crowd of home fans -- in Brazil. If 2008 was the young gun's giddy zenith, the 2011 campaign was his gut-wrenching nadir. His long-distance relationship with American pop star Nicole Scherzinger was more off than on and he had ditched his dad Anthony as manager in favor of a high-profile agency. Hamilton teetered on the edge of controversy and despair. The torch paper was lit at the Monaco Grand Prix when he was penalized by the race stewards. ""It's an absolute frickin' joke,"" he exclaimed. ""Maybe it's because I'm black. That's what Ali G says."" When Hamilton made a surprise switch to Mercedes in 2013, the team would have been well aware that while his impulses propelled him on track, off it they could do more harm than good. ""He is an emotionally driven individual,"" Hamilton's biographer Mark Hughes tells CNN. ""You are never going to change that. ""His emotions were all over the place in 2007 and 2008, and in 2011 he was having big mood swings because of problems off track."" Locked in another intense title fight in 2014, the unpredictably passionate Hamilton had to sink or swim in the cauldron of competition. But, despite the swirling emotions of fighting mano a mano with his Mercedes teammate and close teenage friend Nico Rosberg, Hamilton impressively kept his head above water to win a second world title with some style. So, what's changed? ""He is essentially the same guy [as in 2008] but he definitely seemed more in control of himself at the crucial pressure points on race days,"" Hughes adds. ""He does seem to be in a calm place now and I'd say he's slightly more mature."" Hamilton's inner calm held out despite an F1 season filled with flashpoints that threatened to derail his peace of mind. The Mercedes rivals tested each other's limits in Bahrain, where Hamilton had cut across Rosberg to retake the lead. In Monaco -- where the pair happen to live in the same apartment block -- Rosberg was accused and cleared of blocking Hamilton during qualifying. In Hungary, the Briton then refused to cede to team orders to let Rosberg pass. But the season's big bust-up bloomed in Belgium. Rosberg was forced to apologize to Hamilton after he collided with the rear of his Mercedes in an attempt to retake the lead, effectively putting his rival out of the race. ""Lewis has won the 2014 title in an entirely different set of circumstances to 2008,"" former McLaren F1 driver John Watson tells CNN. ""He and Nico have been battling it out all season. ""Lewis has evolved to be able to deal with the stress. His destiny was in his own hands and he had the maturity to deal with it. ""Lewis always had the racing skill, the racing brain, the seat of the pants raw talent but he has matured into a driver that has come to a new level in terms of his own self-belief and self-confidence."" If Hamilton, who reconciled with Scherzinger at the start of the year, has discovered a Zen-like mental state, an instinctive impulse inside the cockpit has also been key to winning a second world title. When it came to unlocking the pure pace from the Mercedes car in qualifying, Rosberg had the edge. The German out-qualified Hamilton 12-9, taking 11 pole positions to Hamilton's seven over the course of the year. ""Nico is clearly very good at unleashing the big lap at just the crucial moment,"" explains Hughes. ""That induces Lewis to over-strive sometimes and that happened on three or four occasions in qualifying this year."" But when the points were handed out on Sundays, it was the Briton's racing nous that paid dividends as he racked up 11 victories compared to Rosberg's five. ""Even when Nico out-qualifies him, we see Lewis is faster in the race because the tires wear, the track temperature changes, the fuel load changes, the car is never perfection,"" Hughes adds. ""Lewis is a very improvisational driver, he is someone who can just head into the race and improvise his way around anything the car does."" Yet even Hamilton would probably have struggled to improvise his way around the loss of engine power at the season finale in Abu Dhabi, where Rosberg's title hopes ultimately ended. Falling backwards through the field from second to 14th was an agonizing way to lose the title but the 29-year-old was generously gracious in defeat. This may not have been a world title winning season for the son of 1982 winner Keke Rosberg but it has been a year of growth for the driver who was unflatteringly dubbed ""Britney"" -- for his pop star good looks -- by his peers. ""To be up against Lewis, the level was incredibly high and so I also had to find and deliver the next level,"" Rosberg reflected in Abu Dhabi. Hughes, who has also followed Rosberg's career closely since he made his F1 debut with Williams in 2006, agrees. ""Nico's definitely stepped up,"" the Grand Prix Editor for Motor Sport Magazine adds. ""I'd say he has discovered a core of steel within himself and his composure is very impressive. ""Even though he has been trounced by Lewis he has pulled himself back together and gone straight back out and given him a hard time all over again. ""Lewis' level has lent Nico a credibility that is greater than it would have been without Lewis."" Mercedes is expected to be the dominant force in F1 when the new season rolls into Melbourne, Australia for the opening race next March. Red Bull -- the only other team to win races in 2014 -- will be hot on the champion's heels while a resurgent Williams -- the only team to deny Mercedes pole position -- is out to go one better on race day next season. But given the hybrid Mercedes engine's power advantage over the rest of the field, Hamilton and Rosberg are set fair for another internal team tussle for the victory laurels. The question is, can Rosberg dig deep over the winter and reach another level to prevent Hamilton winning a third world title? ""Nico has peaked,"" argues Watson. ""This year he used every element of his driving skill and his mental capacity to take the championship to Lewis. He's not going to get any better. ""The feeling is that Lewis has won this championship as a man in development. This win has been so important because he will take from this and be a better driver in my opinion. ""Be prepared to see more domination."" The quicksilver combination of Hamilton and Mercedes now has the chance to emulate Red Bull's four-year era of dominance that was snuffed out by 2014's major rule change, which focused on engine technology. ""This is a golden opportunity for Lewis,"" says Hughes. ""And it's probably one he's never going to get again. ""He's the favorite in 2015 because the Mercedes gap to the others is so big that even if it's reduced next year, it's probably still going to be there. ""It was looking for a time that Sebastian Vettel winning all those championships with Red Bull meant Lewis' was going to be the great career that never was. ""Now he's in a position to make it a great career and if he keeps winning titles he will be recognized as one of the giants."" Watson, who raced to F1 victories in the late 70s and early 80s, is even tipping Hamilton to succeed a very special member of the Silver Arrows stable. ""Juan Manuel Fangio is my idol as the greatest Grand Prix driver ever,"" says Watson. ""He won the titles for Mercedes in 1954 and 1955. ""Lewis can go on and match that. If he does, his career will be held in great regard and respect. ""What marks you out as a great driver is moving forward and winning multiple world championships. ""But what is more critical is winning titles in different cars with different teams. Fangio has done that and now so has Lewis Hamilton.""","Lewis Hamilton added a second world title to his 2008 crown with victory for Mercedes in 2014 .
""Hamilton is more mature,"" says the British racer's biographer Mark Hughes .

"Washington (CNN) -- Turkey will serve as a ""protecting power"" for the United States in Libya, senior State Department officials told CNN on Sunday. As a protecting power, Turkey will represent the United States in Libya, including acting as consular officers on behalf of U.S. citizens in Libya and looking after American diplomatic facilities in the country. Turkey can also pass messages between the United States and Libya, as what little communication remains between the two countries is likely to come to a grinding halt now that the U.S. is bombing Libyan targets as part of enforcement of a no-fly zone. Levent Sahin Kaya, Turkish ambassador to Libya, told CNN he will represent America in Libya along with the United Kingdom and Italy. Although the United States has not formally suspended ties with Libya, the U.S. State Department shuttered its embassy earlier this month and withdrew all of its diplomats from the country. The State Department also ordered the Libyan embassy in Washington closed and ordered its diplomats to leave the country. It recognized Ali Aujali --  the former ambassador who resigned from the regime in protest of its violence against citizens and joined the opposition --  as the legitimate representative of the Libyan people. Officials said Libya has not yet identified a protecting power of its interests in the United States.

"(CNN)Two Americans were charged Monday in what the U.S. is calling an attempted coup in Gambia, though the African nation's President told local media it was a terrorist attack. Cherno Njie, 57, a U.S. businessman of Gambian descent living in Austin, Texas, and Papa Faal, 46, a dual U.S.-Gambian citizen from Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, were charged ""for their role in a recent attempted coup"" that happened on December 30, the Justice Department said in a statement. Njie, who the criminal complaint says was expected to become Gambia's interim leader if the coup had prevailed, and Faal both traveled to the West African nation in December to overthrow the government, according to the criminal complaint. Before a team of 10 to 12 conspirators entered Gambia last month, Faal, who went by the codename ""Fox,"" and two others procured 24 semiautomatic rifles between August and October and shipped them to Gambia, the complaint says. The conspirators also acquired night vision goggles, body armor, ammunition and black military clothing and boots, it says. They expected up to 160 members of the local Gambian military to join them, and most members of the group had served in the U.S. or Gambian military and were avid shooters, the complaint says. The original plan was to ambush Gambian President Yahya Jammeh as he traveled around the country over the holidays, but when the group learned Jammeh was leaving the country on December 26, they abandoned their plan, the complaint says. A person identified only as ""Subject No. 1"" was the military leader who controlled the money for the operation, the complaint says. Faal told authorities that he understood that each man participating in the event received $4,000 to pay their bills, according to the complaint. Subject No. 1 is the same person who gave Faal $6,000 to buy rifles, the complaint says. ""On Dec. 30, 2014, a number of the co-conspirators, including Faal, met in the woods near the State House in Banjul, which is the home of the Gambian president, and split into two assault teams,"" the Justice Department news release states. Njie, who used the pseudonym ""Dave,"" aimed to wait ""in a safe place until the assault teams took control of the facility,"" the criminal complaint says. The plan was for Njie to wait until the State House was seized and then meet with the Gambian army commander to persuade him to accept the new leadership, it says. ""However, when one of the assault teams approached the State House and fired a shot into the air, the team began taking heavy fire from the guard towers,"" the statement says, adding that numerous conspirators were killed or injured. Faal got on a ferry to Senegal the next day and fled the country. Njie also escaped. Both returned to the U.S., where they were arrested, the Justice Department said. ""These defendants stand accused of conspiring to carry out the violent overthrow of a foreign government, in violation of U.S. law,"" Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement. ""The United States strongly condemns such conspiracies. With these serious charges, the United States is committed to holding them fully responsible for their actions."" A summary of the government's investigation alleges that Faal admitted in an FBI interview to being part of the attempted coup and identified Njie as one of the leaders and financiers of the group behind the plot. Faal left Gambia 23 years ago but still has family in the country. He joined the movement allegedly behind the coup because he was upset by how ""the president was rigging elections"" and had other concerns about the plight of the Gambian people, the criminal complaint says. ""The group's plan for the coup was purportedly to restore democracy to The Gambia and to improve the lives of its people. They hoped they would be able to take over the country without having to kill any Gambians,"" the complaint says. All of the co-conspirators who Faal knew were of Gambian descent, though only some of them lived in Gambia. Others lived in Senegal, the U.S., Germany and UK, according to the complaint. Both men are in custody, and Faal is expected to appear Monday in the U.S. District Court in Minneapolis, while Njie is scheduled to appear in federal court in Baltimore, the statement said. They are each charged with a count of conspiracy to possess a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence, as well as a violation of the Neutrality Act, which forbids Americans from participating in or financing military operations against countries with which the U.S. is at peace. At Faal's home in Minnesota, authorities found manuals for semiautomatic rifles, Google satellite images of Gambia and receipts for 55-gallon drums that Faal said he bought to hide the rifles, the complaint says. At locations in Austin and Lakeway, Texas, both of which belonged to Njie, authorities found a piece of paper with Faal's birth date and passport number, a spreadsheet with weapon prices and a ""handwritten document that appears to describe the author's vision for The Gambia following a transition of political power."" A wife of one of the coup participants who was killed also told authorities that she received a call from an unknown man who told her that her husband had been killed, the complaint says. The call came from the number on Njie's business card for Chelsea Seniors I, LLC, where he was a manager, the complaint says. Despite repeated references to a coup in U.S. government documents, Jammeh told his Cabinet last week that the plot was a ""terrorist attack"" perpetrated by ""Gambian dissidents in the U.S., Germany and UK."" ""We have a comprehensive understanding of what they had been planning,"" Jammeh said, according to the Daily Observer newspaper. ""What is so interesting is the fact that we were able to get all that they had in their computer. We had all the information about their plans for which we will release very soon."" The State Department acknowledged reports of last week's attack and issued a statement saying, ""We strongly condemn any attempt to seize power through extra-constitutional means. We regret the loss of life and call on all parties to refrain from further violence."" Jammeh said the conspirators involved in last week's plot will be dealt with harshly, according to The Point newspaper. ""We will get to the bottom of this and we will not spare anybody. I will set an example and let everybody be prepared for that. Enough is enough. They want to destroy our country, we will destroy them,"" he reportedly said.","Cherno Njie, 57, of Austin, Texas, and Papa Faal, 46, of Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, face charges .

"Sergio Garcia's parents brought him to the United States from Mexico nearly two decades ago. He's been waiting for a green card ever since. But there's one thing the undocumented immigrant no longer has to wait for, according to a California Supreme Court ruling on Thursday: his law license. Garcia can be admitted to California's state bar and legally practice as a lawyer there, the court ruled. The landmark case quickly caught the eye of activists on both sides of the national immigration debate. Garcia, 36, says his American dream has finally come true. ""With tears in my eyes I'm happy to report I am being admitted to the bar, thank God!"" he said in a Facebook post Thursday after the court's ruling. ""This one is for all of you who dare to dream and by doing so change the world! Love you all! History was made today!"" But the case raises many questions, particularly among those who have been critical of Garcia's efforts to practice law. ""How is Garcia supposed to uphold 'the laws of the United States' when he is, by his mere presence in this country, in violation of federal law?"" CNN contributor Ruben Navarrette asks in an opinion column he wrote on the case in September. ""How does he pledge to show respect for 'the courts of justice' when, for most of his life, he has lived here in defiance of the rule of law? And how can he claim that he won't 'mislead' a judge or judicial officer when living in the United States illegally requires deception on a daily basis?"" California's Supreme Court ruled Thursday that no state law or public policy should stop Garcia or others like him from obtaining a law license in the state. Immigration officials would be unlikely to pursue sanctions against an undocumented immigrant who had been living in the United States for years, had been educated in this country and whose sole unlawful conduct was his presence in this country, the court said in a unanimous ruling written by Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye. ""Under these circumstances, we conclude that the fact that an undocumented immigrant's presence in this country violates federal statutes is not itself a sufficient or persuasive basis for denying undocumented immigrants, as a class, admission to the State Bar,"" the court ruled. A lengthy legal battle . Garcia was born in Mexico in 1977 and taken to California by his parents when he was 17 months old, according to court documents. He remained there until 1986, when he and his parents returned to Mexico. Eight years later, at age 17, Garcia again returned to California with his parents and without documentation, though his father had obtained permanent resident status in the United States. That year, Garcia's father filed an immigration visa petition on his son's behalf, which federal immigration officials accepted in 1995. But, 19 years later, the visa has not been granted, even though Garcia has lived in the state since 1994. ""Because the current backlog of persons of Mexican origin who are seeking immigrant visas is so large, as of the date of this opinion -- more than 19 years after Garcia's visa petition was filed -- a visa number still has not become available for Garcia,"" the Supreme Court's ruling said. The ruling marks the end of a lengthy legal battle for Garcia, who received a law degree from Cal Northern School of Law in 2009. That year, he passed the California bar exam. For about two weeks, Garcia was sworn in as an attorney. Then he received a notice from the state bar that his admission was in error. ""It was very, very hard for me to have to tell my family that the celebration we had meant nothing,"" Garcia told CNN en Español in September. ""It killed me inside to tell them that I really wasn't a lawyer."" The matter ended up in the California state court system, and Garcia earned the support of California Attorney General Kamala Harris, who wrote in a 2012 brief: ""Admitting Garcia to the bar would be consistent with state and federal policy that encourages immigrants, both documented and undocumented, to contribute to society."" The state bar argued that Garcia had met all of California's requirements for a law license. ""With today's ruling, the California Supreme Court reaffirms the Committee of Bar Examiners' finding as not a political decision but rather one grounded in the law,"" California State Bar President Luis J. Rodriguez said in a written statement Thursday. Case could set precedent . Critics have argued that giving Garcia a license wouldn't make sense. How can someone without legal status become licensed as a lawyer, whose job entails upholding the law? Larry DeSha, former prosecutor for the State Bar of California, said Garcia shouldn't be given his law license because his immigration status would be in violation of a civil immigration statute and could affect his ability to represent his clients. ""In the immigration debate, we must separate the individual from the idea. The individual -- Garcia -- looks like a keeper. The idea -- that one who has lived most of his life outside the law can practice law -- is problematic,"" Navarrette wrote in his September column. The executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors tighter immigration restrictions, said the case is part of a troubling trend. ""The ruling that an unlawful immigrant can be admitted to the practice of law in California is the kind of thing that will light up talk-show switchboards, and rightly so. But beyond the Bizarro World nature of the decision is a broader issue,"" Mark Krikorian wrote in an editorial published on the National Review's website. ""This is only the latest in a series of measures by some jurisdictions to normalize illegal immigration."" The Obama administration originally opposed Garcia's admission to the bar, saying that federal law demanded that legislation be enacted granting an undocumented immigrant the right to practice, according to a summary published by lawprofessors.typepad.com. But the Justice Department backed off in November after California's governor signed a new law that did just that. The bill, which passed in October and went into effect this week, allows the bar to admit ""an applicant who is not lawfully present in the United States (who) has fulfilled the requirements for admission to practice law."" That ""greased the skids"" in making the court's work easier, said Dan Kowalski, editor of Bender's Immigration Bulletin and himself an immigration attorney. ""I think it's a natural, logical decision,"" he told CNN in a telephone interview, adding that he expected other states to follow suit. Víctor Nieblas, an immigration attorney based in Southern California, told CNN in September that the court's decision could affect hundreds of other young professionals in the United States who are seeking a license. ""He's the first, but he's not the only. There are cases going on in New York and Florida,"" said Rina Gandhi, a third-year law student at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia. Gandhi, who heads an immigration law and service organization that invited Garcia to speak at her school last year, said the ruling is a positive step. ""I'm glad to see us moving forward in the right direction,"" she said, adding that the case highlights the problems caused by backlogs in the country's immigration system. ""He does have an immigration application pending,"" she said. ""It's more a result of the broken immigration system that we currently have that he's been waiting 19 years.""","California State Bar: The decision is a legal one, not a political one .

"Fighting is raging between al Qaeda-backed militants and Iraq's security forces for control of two key cities in the embattled Anbar province, even as a deal was in place with Sunni tribesmen to fight alongside Iraqi police against the terror group. The renewed violence in the Sunni province has raised concern about the stability of the government amid dueling claims by the terror group and security forces over who was in control of Falluja and Ramadi. At least 80 people were killed, roughly 60 of the casualties were members of al Qaeda, in clashes Friday across the province, a senior interior ministry official told CNN. Some of the most significant fighting appeared to be in Falluja, where the U.S. military fought one of the bloodiest battles of the Iraq war, with militants planting al Qaeda flags on buildings. Gunmen calling themselves the Islamic State of Iraq and Levant, formerly known as al Qaeda in Iraq, took to a stage before thousands of Sunnis following Friday prayers in Falluja. ""We call you to join us in our fight against the government of Nuri al-Maliki,"" one of the gunman said through a bullhorn. More than two-thirds of the people in attendance left once the militant began to speak, according to a journalist working for CNN. The gunmen ordered journalists not to cover their speech, threatening to kill anyone who attempted to film or record the event, according to the journalist, who is not being identified by CNN out of security concerns. Fighting also was under way in Ramadi, police officials told CNN, but would not provide a specific number of casualties. In that area, tribal leaders have been calling on their fighters not to cover their faces so they can recognize their own people. The violence -- pitting Sunni militants against Shiite-dominated forces -- recalls the bloody fighting at the height of the Iraq war that nearly tore the country apart. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf dismissed suggestions that the United States has abandoned Iraq following its withdrawal from the country in 2011. ""Let's be clear who's responsible for the violence. It's the terrorists who were behind it,"" she told reporters during a briefing in Washington. ""That's why we are partnering with the Iraqi government very closely to fight this shared threat. At the end of the day, we can certainly help them fight it, but we also want to help them build their own capability to do so themselves."" The United States is sending weapons, including Hellfire rockets and drones, to aid them in their campaign against terrorism, officials have said. Harf said a number of American officials on the ground in Iraq and in Washington ""remain in touch with all of the different parties in Iraq. "" Meanwhile, after a deal brokered late Thursday, Sunni tribesman began fighting alongside Iraqi security forces in the province on Friday to try to tamp down the violence from Sunni militants. The deal was comparable to a 2007 U.S. pact that saw Sunnis turn on al Qaeda, siding with American and Iraqi forces to bring about an end to the terrorism. The latest round of violence erupted late last week following a raid by security forces on the home of prominent Sunni lawmaker Ahmed al-Alwani, one of the main organizers of the anti-government demonstrations in Anbar province. Alwani's brother and five of his bodyguards were killed during the raid, which also left at least 16 people wounded, authorities said. That was quickly followed by a move to close two protest camps that were established last year as part of ongoing demonstrations against the Shiite-led government, which protesters claim has marginalized the country's minority Sunni population. A senior official with Iraq's interior ministry in Baghdad told CNN that al Qaeda has taken advantage of the security vacuum created by fighting between Iraqi forces and Sunnis. But tensions between Sunnis and Shiites have been running high since last year when security forces raided a protest camp in Hawija. Dozens of people were killed in the raid, which was captured by local journalists.","At least 80 people have been killed in fighting in Falluja, an official says .

"In the city of Qamishli, on Syria's border with Turkey, neither the forces of the Syrian regime nor the rebels of the Free Syrian Army are to be seen. But visitors say the Kurdish flag is very evident, and Kurdish fighters man checkpoints around the city. More are being trained in the Kurdish region of neighboring Iraq. Away from the epicenter of the battle for Syria, the Kurdish minority -- about 10% of the Syrian population -- has gained control of two areas. One is around Qamishli, which has a population of nearly 200,000; the other is north of Aleppo in towns like Afrin and Ayn al-'Arab. They have one aim, best summed up by a poster at a recent rally that read: ""Federalizm (sic) is the best solution for new Syria."" Syria's Kurds do not live in one region, unlike Iraq's. They are scattered across northern Syria. But their growing if patchy autonomy promises to be a source of friction with other Syrian groups in the months ahead, and may have seismic consequences for Turkey, Iraq and even Iran. When the unrest began in Syria last year, most Kurds remained on the sidelines. As a minority, they feared the emergence of a Syria dominated by Sunnis. And the main Kurdish group -- the Democratic Union Party, or PYD -- was useful to the regime. It has long been (and remains) an affiliate of the PKK, the militant group in Turkey that has fought for Kurdish autonomy for three decades, a struggle that has claimed tens of thousands of lives. ""The PKK has always had very good connections with the Syrian Kurds and especially with the PYD,"" said Turkish journalist Rusen Cakir, who has followed the Kurdish story for decades. ""Many Syrian Kurds have been killed by Turkish security forces in battles with the PKK,"" he said. The PKK claims some 3,500 of its ""martyrs"" have been Syrian. So the PYD was a tool with which the Assad regime could threaten the Turks should they interfere in events inside Syria, said Soner Cagaptay of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. ""Assad wants to make it difficult for the Turks to intervene without getting into a war with the PKK, and unlike Iraq and Iran, the PKK has real grass-roots support in Syria,"" Cagaptay told CNN. For both Assad and the PYD it was an opportunistic relationship. Intelligence sources in the region say the regime even allowed several hundred Kurdish militants back into the country from the Qandil mountains in the far northeastern corner of Iraq, including the group's leader, Salih Muslim Muhammad. There were also reports that PYD militia were deployed to stifle anti-regime protests by Kurdish youth groups. Then -- in October 2011 -- a prominent Syrian Kurdish activist, Meshaal Tammo, was assassinated. Many Kurds blamed the regime for his murder. The PYD may have feared that any association with the regime -- and lingering suspicions it may have been complicit in Tammo's murder -- would harm its credibility. It vehemently denied involvement, but has since begun to forge a ""third way,"" backing neither the government nor the rebels but using the vacuum of authority to carve out a zone of control. PYD leader Salih Muslim Muhammad told the Berlin-based Kurdwatch blog last year: ""What is important is that we Kurds assert our existence. The current regime does not accept us, nor do those who will potentially come into power."" In July, Assad's security forces suddenly relinquished control of several Kurdish towns. Cale Salih of the International Crisis Group said that whether they did so voluntarily to focus on other places or were ""told"" to leave -- as the PYD insists -- is unclear. The effect was the same: alarm in Turkey, already at war with the PKK in the mountains along the Iraqi border. ""As the Turks see it, with identical PKK/PYD flags reportedly being raised over Ayn al-'Arab and Afrin, developments suggest that the PKK may be creating a safe haven for itself on Turkey's border with Syria,"" Cagaptay wrote last month on CNN's Global Public Square. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan warns that any attempt by the PKK -- which is designated a terrorist organization by both the United States and European Union -- to launch cross-border attacks would be met by force. The Turkish army underlined that warning with a large exercise less than a mile from border villages now controlled by the PYD. The United States has chimed in with its own concerns. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said: ""We share Turkey's determination that Syria must not become a haven for PKK terrorists whether now or after the departure of the Assad regime."" ""That could be a big disaster for Turkey, not now but maybe in two years,"" Cakir said. ""Turkey can never accept the PKK controlling the Syrian side of the border. It is highly possible the Turkish military would intervene in Syria."" The picture is complicated by a brewing battle for supremacy among Syria's Kurds. The PYD is now being challenged by a loose coalition known as the Kurdish National Council. The group, although riven by internal disputes, is sponsored by the Iraqi Kurdish leader Massoud Barzani. Cagaptay, of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said Barzani has tried to bring the PYD and Kurdish National Council together, but evidence suggests little co-operation and plenty of rivalry. According to Salih, who has traveled widely in the region for the International Crisis Group, there is a real risk of conflict between Kurdish factions for control of Qamishli in coming months. It is where the Kurdish National Council is strongest, but the PYD has been making inroads, and there have already been clashes between supporters of the two groups, she said. Salih said that hundreds of Syrian Kurds -- some of them defectors from the army -- are receiving military training in Iraq. So far it appears they have been unable to return to Syria. Barzani, a veteran Kurdish nationalist, clearly wants to influence events in Syria, but at the same time he realizes that Turkey is important as a route for oil exports from Iraqi Kurdistan. He has no wish to antagonize Ankara, and may even help by trying to ""box in"" the PYD. Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davotoglu recently called on Barzani in Irbil, and they ""emphasized that any attempt to exploit the power vacuum by any violent group or organization (in Syria) will be considered as a common threat,"" a not-so-veiled warning to the PYD. Another element in this explosive regional equation is the strained relationship between the Iraqi Kurds and Iraq's central government. The Kurds are increasingly at odds with the Shiite government led by Nuri al-Maliki in Baghdad, and so is Turkey, according to Cagaptay. Reports from the border area say the Kurdish peshmerga patrolling the Syrian border are sometimes just a few hundred yards from regular Iraqi troops. However the Syrian revolt unfolds, ""the experience of the Syrian Kurds will have an influence on Iran's Kurds and Turkey's Kurdish population,"" said Cakir, who is a senior correspondent for the Vatan newspaper. For the PKK, Syria provides an opportunity -- and possibly another front against Turkey's military. Cakir sees that as adding a new dynamic to Turkish politics. ""The Turkish state has to deal with the PKK in a political way by persuading it to disarm,"" he told CNN. ""This will be very difficult, as previous conflicts such as Northern Ireland have shown. But the Turkish military cannot defeat the PKK."" He added that, ""according to conventional wisdom, this is not the time to begin such a political initiative, with presidential elections due in 2014. But we must solve this question as soon as possible or there will be a catastrophe."" Cagaptay agrees that as a new constitution is written in Turkey, the Kurdish issue must be tackled. Turkey's Kurds, he says, may soon look around the region and see that their brethren in Syria and Iraq are better off. It's widely assumed that Erdogan will run for the presidency in 2014. Cagaptay describes him as ""the most powerful elected leader Turkey has ever had, and he has an opportunity to address the Kurdish issue"" by advancing autonomy for Turkey's 14 million Kurds. But for Turkey's substantial nationalist vote, that may be a bridge too far.","Kurdish fighters have gained control over areas of northern Syria .
The main Kurdish group, the PYD, has been seen as useful to the Assad regime .
It has close ties to the PKK, the group fighting in Turkey for Kurdish autonomy .

"Nancy Pelosi says there are 14 million reasons why Chuck Schumer is wrong. In an intraparty feud about political strategy, the House minority leader called out the No. 3 Senate Democratic leader for saying on Friday that it was a mistake for Democrats to focus on passing health care reform in 2010. ""After passing the stimulus, Democrats should have continued to propose middle class-oriented programs and built on the partial success of the stimulus, but unfortunately Democrats blew the opportunity the American people gave them,"" Schumer said in a remarks focused on political messaging heading into 2016 at the National Press Club. New York's Schumer added, ""We took their mandate and put all our focus on the wrong problem -- health care reform."" When asked whether she agreed with Schumer's assessment, California's Pelosi didn't mince words in a written statement provided to CNN. ""We come here to do a job, not keep a job. There are more than 14 million reasons why that's wrong,"" Pelosi said. The 14 million figure Pelosi cites references those Americans who now have health care coverage since the law was enacted. It adds together those who have signed up through health care exchanges, those allowed to say on their parent's health care plans through age 26 and those getting coverage through the expansion of the Medicaid program. Pelosi's office also maintained that the Affordable Care Act has had a positive economic effect in terms of bending the cost curve over the long term. They also took issue with the notion that the House, under Pelosi's speakership, wasn't focused on the economy after Obama was elected.  An aide noted that the House passed a jobs bill the Democratic-led Senate did not take up, and the original version of the stimulus bill the House passed was larger than the final version the Senate approved. An aide to Schumer said the New York Democrat has hinted at this concern in the past.

"Amid all the talk of Germany's new-found domination of European football after the success of Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund in reaching the Champions League final, Juventus' achievement of winning the Italian title for a record-extending 29th time almost passed by without notice at the weekend. It was Juve's second consecutive Serie A crown and provided further testimony to the impact coach Antonio Conte has had given he has only been in charge since mid-2011. Like all successful coaches, Conte has already turned his thoughts to the future rather than the past as he called for renewed investment from the club to enable him to take the team forward. ""Conte the man definitely wants to stay at Juventus,"" he had said prior to Sunday's 1-0 win over Palermo, which confirmed Juve's title success. ""However there is also Antonio Conte the professional, who needs to sit down with the club.  I've left big jobs before when I didn't believe in the club's plans."" Back in April, Antonio Conte had lamented his team's lack of spending power when the 'Old Lady' of Italian football lost to Bayern Munich in the Champions League quarterfinals. ""If you have money, you buy players and you win,"" said Conte after Juve's exit. ""There are superpowers like Real, Bayern, Barcelona and PSG who have a turnover of $524 million."" But if Juve  hasn't yet been able to replicate its prowess of the mid-1990s in Europe's top club competition following the match-fixing scandal of seven years ago, relief might be on the way. If an Italian side is to break through in the Champions League, Juve, which appeared in three straight Champions League finals between 1996 and 1998, will be the most likely candidate, not a rebuilding AC Milan. Unlike most other Italian teams, Juve's financial outlook isn't gloomy. Long backed by car manufacturer Fiat and owning its own, newer stadium -- bucking the trend in Italy -- that replaced the eyesore of the Stadio Delle Alpi gives Juve a sizable head start. The good times domestically could kick-start a run in Europe, according to an Italian football expert. ""They have can a massive advantage domestically, and I think in the long run, that's going to give them the ability to challenge in the Champions League,"" John Foot, author of Calcio: A History of Italian Football and a professor of modern Italian history at University College London, told CNN. ""I don't think they're that far away. They've done this thing which all the other Italian teams find very difficult to do or have the will to do, which is to move to the German model of having their own stadium, which is a cash cow. ""I think they're extremely well managed and the scandal is behind them,"" added Foot, referring to the ""Calciopoli"" match-fixing scandal which saw the club stripped of its 2005 and 2006 titles. According to the 2013 version of the Deloitte Money League, a list of the highest earning clubs in football, Juve placed 10th with revenues of $256 million in 2011/2012. Juve was the second-highest ranked Italian team, two spots behind AC Milan. Television package . More encouragingly for Juve, though, was an increase of around $52 million from the previous term -- bettering Real Madrid, Barcelona and Manchester United, the top three clubs on the list. And Juve did top Bayern Munich in one revenue stream -- broadcast revenues. Continual appearances in the Champions League, coupled with the new stadium, will only help matters. Juve posted a profit of $14.8 million in the first half of 2012/2013, and although it said it expects the full-year figure to be in the red, losses are anticipated to be less than last season's $64 million and far less than 2010/2011's club record deficit of $124 million. The Italian champions are said to be in discussions with Samsung, already a sponsor of the team, over naming rights to the stadium and a shirt sponsorship pact that could bring in $157 million. But when Conte refers to Juve and other Italian teams lagging behind other football powerhouses, he is fully justified given Real Madrid's revenue figure of $672.6 million headed the Deloitte list. Despite Manchester City being a relatively new player in world football, City's matchday revenues outdid those of Juve. The Turin club's broadcast revenues were inferior to the likes of Manchester United, Manchester City, Arsenal and Chelsea, who benefit from the English Premier League's multi-billion pound television rights deal. Serie A's overseas television rights deal, the Daily Mail reported last fall, was a mere one-sixth of the English Premier League. Perhaps an indication of its lessening appeal, Serie A -- dissimilar to the English Premier League, La Liga and the Bundesliga -- doesn't have a jersey sponsor for its match officials. ""One of the problems of Serie A is that it's difficult to see it,"" Foot said. ""There's not a package, which is worse than it was in the '90s."" Call for reform . Juve president Andrea Agnelli wants change in Italian football, and so too does retired AC Milan and Italy great Paolo Maldini, part of the Milan team that beat Conte and Juventus in all an-Italian Champions League final in 2003. ""If you go outside the San Siro you can see people selling fake merchandising,"" he told Reuters news agency in April. ""It was like that when I started to play and it is still like that now. You can't allow this. Then you have old stadiums, very old stadiums. San Siro is a historic stadium. It's nice but doesn't offer comfort ... we have to improve it. ""Above all we need to learn from leagues that make money from sports rather than lose money."" Conte echoed those thoughts after Juve's Champions League exit. I think we need to change Italian football and when I say we I mean us, the other clubs, media, fans and institutions,"" he said. ""Abroad they invest money in projects, here we talk about referees and what cars the players are driving."" On the pitch Juve didn't do as well as last season, which was not a surprise since it finished unbeaten in Serie A in 2011/2012. Yet the margin of victory was still impressive. Juve pulled away from Napoli and by the end of the weekend held a 11-point lead. Without benefiting from the individual brilliance of a Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Robin van Persie or Luis Suarez, Juve relied on a balanced attack and various sources to hit the back of the net. Creativity came from more than playmaker Andrea Pirlo, too. Before Sunday's win over Palermo, four Juve players had more assists than Pirlo. Conte's team was marshalled at the back by three notable Italian internationals, keeper Gianluigi Buffon and central defenders Andrea Barzagli and Giorgio Chiellini. A deal with Samsung would help Juve  in its chase of summer targets and bolster its European prospects next season. Alexis Sanchez of Barcelona, who hasn't shown his Udinese form in Spain, Paris Saint-Germain's Italian playmaker Marco Verratti, and talismanic striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic -- a former Juve players -- have all been linked with the Italian champions. It all points to a promising period for Juve. Maybe the glory days in Europe will return sooner than Conte anticipated. ""What Agnelli goes on about now is the system must be reformed,"" Foot said. ""But he has done more than anyone else domestically, so I think Juventus are in a good position.""","Juventus secure second successive Serie A title with 1-0 win over Palermo .

"Uruguay international Edinson Cavani signed a five-year deal with French champions Paris Saint-Germain Tuesday -- for a reported French record fee of euro 64 million ($84 million). Striker Cavani, nicknamed ""El Matador"" for his flamboyant style on the pitch, joins PSG from Napoli, where he was Serie A top scorer last season with 29 goals. He was unveiled at an official press conference in the French capital and said the prospect of joining the Qatari-backed side proved irresistible. ""I had three spectacular years in Naples, but here I am joining a very ambitious project,"" Cavani told PSG's official Twitter feed. His signing underlines PSG's determination to match the spending of Ligue 1 rivals Monaco, who have been taken over by Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev. Since being promoted to the French top flight at the end of last season, Monaco have invested heavily in players, most notably Colombian striker Radamel Falcoa. That deal, worth a reported euros 60 million ($78 million) was also a record as he signed from La Liga side Atletico Madrid. But PSG's acquisition of the 26-year-old Cavani will see him pair up with former Napoli teammate Ezequiel Lavezzi, of  Argentina, in a formidable striking partnership. ""The transfer of Edinson Cavani is further proof of the club's ability to attract the best players in the world,"" PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi told their official website. PSG, who were to prove David Beckham's final club, won the French title last season under the stewardship of Carlo Ancelotti. He has left to coach Real Madrid, but his replacement Laurent Blanc will not lack resources to mount a sustained challenge for the European Champions League next season. They have also expressed their determination to hold on to Brazilian star Thiago Silva, who has been strongly linked with a move to Spanish giants Barcelona. Silva's agent, Paulo Tonieto, told PSG's official  website: ""Thiago is a PSG player. He has a contract and he will respect it. ""The rumors are the same as the ones last year but Thiago Silva is a PSG  player and he'll see out his contract with his club."" Cavani, who helped Uruguay to Copa America glory in 2011, has long been a target for a host of Europe's leading clubs and with 38 goals in just 43 matches for Napoli in all competitions last season his price tag rose.","Edinson Cavani signs for Paris-Saint Germain .

"London, England (CNN) -- Procter & Gamble is recalling Vicks Sinex nasal spray in the United States, Britain and Germany after finding it contained bacteria, the company said. Procter & Gamble said it announced the voluntary recall after finding the bacteria in a small amount of product made at a plant in Germany. There have been no reports of illness from the bacteria, but it could cause serious infections for people with weakened immune systems or those with chronic lung conditions such as cystic fibrosis, Procter & Gamble said late Thursday. The bacteria poses little risk to healthy people, the company said. Cincinnati, Ohio-based Procter & Gamble said it detected the problem during routine quality control at the plant. Analysis so far shows the problem is limited to a single batch of raw material mixture involving three lots of product, which were sold only in the three countries affected by the recall, the company said. In the United States, the recalled product is Vicks Sinex Vapospray 12-hour Decongestant Ultra Fine Mist with lot number 9239028831.

"Washington (CNN)Elizabeth Warren has tried to discourage the groups urging her to run for president. The senator flatly said ""no"" when asked about running in 2016. She backed Hillary Clinton's likely candidacy in a 2013 letter. And she told CNN a whopping six times -- in one interview -- that she wasn't running. All of that, though, matters little to the coalition of liberal groups behind Run Warren Run, a liberal draft campaign for the first-term senator. These activists, who hunger for a 2016 option that fits their progressive mold, look at the senator's refusals as a reason to up the ante, not quietly back away. Their hope that is that their money, organization and manpower can convince Warren, the once little-known Harvard professor, that she could become the first Madam President. One month without a Hillary Clinton headliner . This dance played out clearly on Thursday when the liberal coalition of MoveOn.org and Democracy for Action announced that they are expanding their early presidential state action by opening an office in Iowa and hiring a former Obama staffer -- Blair Lawton -- to run their state operation. Their announcement comes two days after Warren told former Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Chairman Sheila Bair, in an interview with Fortune Magazine, that she wasn't running for president. ""So are you going to run for president?"" questioned Bair. ""No,"" said Warren. Some Democrats -- especially those who want to see another Democratic president -- saw this as a reason for the groups to stop their persistence. But the Run Warren Run reaction to Warren's statement was simple and different: This is why we are doing what we are doing. ""Sen. Warren is not planning to run for president,"" said Ben Wikler, head of MoveOn's Washington office. ""The whole point is to make the case to her and encourage her to change her mind."" Rating 2016 candidates by donor busts conventional wisdom . And in an apparent shot at Hillary Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner who has been quietly building a political staff before a likely presidential run, Wikler added, ""She is not building a secret campaign apparatus and hoping someone taps her shoulder. She is not floating trial balloons."" MoveOn, who pledged at the start to spend $1 million on the Warren draft effort, has started to fundraise from their members to prolong the project. ""Yes, we have been fundraising for the Run Warren Run effort,"" Brian Stewart, the group's spokesman. ""We're confident that our initial $1 million investment is a beginning floor."" The key words there are ""beginning floor."" In addition to their Iowa office and organizers, the group announced earlier this week (on the same day Warren said ""no"") that they were kicking off their efforts in New Hampshire, another critical presidential state. These efforts will include multiple offices in the state and a local staff. None of that is cheap. For liberal groups, though, propping up Warren is not a selfless act, either. When Warren is involved, MoveOn organizers say, their members become more engaged and excited. And by keeping Warren's name in the mix of prospective 2016 candidates, the groups are also raising their profile and importance. Liberal groups slate pro-Warren rally in NH . For that reason, Wikler and MoveOn are not prepared to say at what point they will buy Warren's ""no."" ""So much can change in politics, so much is fluid,"" the organizer said. ""Things that are certain one day, may not be the next. Our focus is on maximizing the possibility that she does.""","Elizabeth Warren has said repeatedly that she won't run for president in 2016 .
But to a group of liberal organizers urging her to do so, her refusals are reason to ante up .

"Journalists covering last week's economic summit overheard French President Nicolas Sarkozy blasting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a ""liar"" during a talk with U.S. President Barack Obama, according to published reports. The private conversation was inadvertently carried by open microphones before an Obama-Sarkozy news conference on the sidelines of the Group of 20 economic summit in the French resort of Cannes. Its contents were first reported by the French website Arret Sur Images, which said reporters heard Sarkozy's comments in French and Obama's reply through a translator. ""I can't stand him. He's a liar,"" Sarkozy said of Netanyahu, according to the website. Obama replied, ""You're tired of him; what about me? I have to deal with him every day,"" the site reported. Arret Sur Images (""Freeze Frame"") said journalists had listened in on the conversation but had agreed not to report it. The Reuters and Associated Press news services confirmed that report Tuesday. ""We didn't record it, and to use it would force us to admit that we had cheated,"" Arret Sur Images quoted one of the reporters who heard the conversation, whom it did not name. ""Also, it would have caused great problems for the people responsible for the event's organization."" Dan Israel, the Arret Sur Images writer who broke the story, told CNN that about three minutes of the leaders' private conversation could be heard. ""It was a mistake by the organization for the G-20 summit,"" Israel said. He said journalists agreed among themselves to consider the remarks off the record because they didn't want to get a summit staffer heard into a ""rough patch"" after he disclosed that the audio could be heard. But the word spread rapidly among journalists in Paris, prompting Arret Sur Images to start chasing the report, he said. ""Some of them did give me the quotes, and others just confirmed the quotes,"" Israel said. The report was met with silence from the Elysee Palace, the French president's office, which did not respond to requests for comment. In Washington, White House spokesman Jay Carney said he had no comment on the conversation or Obama's response but said, ""The president's position has been quite clear on the issue of efforts by the Palestinians to achieve through the U.N. what can only be achieved effectively through direct negotiations."" Netanyahu's office also had no comment. But in the United States, the Anti-Defamation League said it was ""deeply disappointed and saddened"" by the private conversation, warning that it could hurt ties between Israel and two key players in the Middle East peace process. ""President Obama's response to Mr. Sarkozy implies that he agrees with the French leader,"" ADL Director Abe Foxman said in a written statement. ""In light of the revelations here, we hope that the Obama administration will do everything it can to reassure Israel that the relationship remains on a sure footing and to reinvigorate the trust between President Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, which clearly is not what it should be."" A member of Netanyahu's coalition in the Knesset, Israel's parliament, said ""there is not much love lost"" between the Israeli leader and his counterparts. ""It's unpleasant,"" said Einat Wilf, whose Independence party is allied with Netanyahu's ruling Likud. ""Of course, we would all like to be loved and all love to have great relationships with each other, and I'm sure it would be nicer to know that our prime minister is loved. But at the end of the day, what did Machiavelli say? It's more important to be feared than loved."" Israeli opposition leaders have questioned Netanyahu's honesty before, but Labor Party lawmaker Daniel Ben-Simon said he was ""ashamed"" that the leaders of two of Israel's top allies ""could characterize my prime minister as a liar."" ""If the most friendly leaders say that about my prime minister, what do others say about him who are not as friendly?"" said Ben-Simon, the head of the Israeli-French Parliamentary Association.""If he lies to them, he must be lying to Israelis as well.""","""He's a liar,"" Sarkozy says of Israeli PM, a French website reports .

Nashville's gruffest and grittiest star turns out to be its most reliable traditionalist, a Music Row pro who can write a song for every emotional season. Johnson pulled out a whole slew of them -- 25, clocking in north of 105 minutes -- for his double-disc fourth album: acoustic confessions and rugged boogie blues, big weepers and grim reapers, cover tunes and novelty ditties, not to mention ""California Riots"" and ""Playing the Part,"" a pair of fiercely funny, unrepentantly redneck swipes at the frou-frou blue states. 4.

"An attorney for Rep. Ron Barber (D-Ariz.) is raising the prospect of a long, drawn-out battle over control of his Tucson-area district, a seat once held by his former boss Gabby Giffords, as his contest with Republican Martha McSally looks increasingly likely to head to a recount. Kevin Hamilton, Barber's legal counsel, said Wednesday that the campaign isn't taking ""anything off the table"" in potentially challenging the outcome of the race when it's certified next month. ""There are lots of potential options. There is the ability to file an election contest under state law. There's a recount that goes forward, and as we've seen in other states that can affect the outcome of the election,"" he said. ""There's a range of options and we're not taking anything off the table."" McSally, as of the last vote tally, leads Barber by just 161 votes, a margin that will trigger an automatic recount after the state certifies the vote Dec. 1. But Barber's campaign has identified more than 130 ballots in Pima County they say were illegitimately thrown out, and say there are likely others. The campaign attempted to delay the vote certification in Pima and requested those ballots be included, but the request was denied Tuesday. And while they're pursuing another delay in the district's other county because of similar ballot issues on Thursday, Democrats admit they're not optimistic it will be granted. Democrats won't publicly address the prospect of pursuing legal options in the race, and Hamilton declined to comment specifically on what those options might be. But he at times compared the situation in Arizona's 2nd district to Sen. Al Franken's (D-Minn.) 2008 reelection legal fight, which dragged on for more than eight months. ""In the Franken recount, there was an effort to add in wrongfully rejected ballots in the recount and we can talk about that if we get to that point,"" Hamilton said. Under state law, however, Barber would have to wait to file a legal challenge until after the secretary of State has certified the results of the election, which is due Dec. 1. In the meantime, McSally is already moving forward with her duties as though congresswoman-elect. She arrived in Washington this week for freshman orientation, and her spokesman said she's ""very confident"" her lead will hold after the entire process is through. Barber's seat is just one of a handful not yet called from this year's midterms.

"New elections will probably be held on March 17, the speaker of Israel's parliament said Wednesday, a day after the Prime Minister sacked two senior members of his coalition Cabinet for criticizing government policy. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also called for parliament to be dissolved, a step that the Knesset is now considering. Lawmakers voted unanimously to dissolve parliament in a preliminary vote Wednesday, according to the official Knesset website. A Knesset committee will now prepare a bill for further votes by lawmakers early next week. Speaker Yuli Edelstein said the party heads had agreed on March 17 as the proposed election date. The upheaval was triggered when Netanyahu ordered letters of dismissal for Finance Minister Yair Lapid and Justice Minister Tzipi Livni, two members of his Cabinet from rival parties, according to a statement from his office Tuesday. ""During the last few weeks and, in particular, the last few days, the ministers have intensely attacked the government that I am leading,"" Netanyahu said. ""... I will not tolerate ministers attacking the government's policy and its head from inside the government."" The call for new elections means Israel is effectively in a state of political paralysis until March. Israel held its last election just 22 months ago. A poll for Israel's Channel 2 suggested that 55% of those surveyed were against another election being held so soon. Polls give mixed picture . Netanyahu will hope that the vote enables him to form a government he can work with, including right-wing and religious parties, but there is no guarantee that he will be able to form the coalition he wants. Netanyahu has been Prime Minister since 2009. But he's had to rely on members of other parties -- many of them to the left of Likud on the political spectrum, such as the centrist parties of Livni and Lapid -- to govern. Netanyahu is also calculating that he can win a fourth term in office. Opinion polls give a mixed picture, indicating that many people blame him for the current crisis but that at the same time, if elections were held today, his right-wing Likud party would increase its share of seats in the 120-seat Knesset. However, people feel there is a range of problems that are not being dealt with, such as a faltering economy, recent attacks against Israelis in Jerusalem and this summer's inconclusive war against Hamas militants in Gaza. Netanyahu blasts 'putsch' Netanyahu told reporters Tuesday that a divided government was one of Israel's problems, saying there was a lot of debate, contradictions and ultimatums. He called out Livni for meeting with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas against his advice and for criticizing building in Jerusalem, which some say has exacerbated tensions with Arabs there. And Netanyahu lambasted Lapid for calling Israel's boycott of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's U.N. speech a mistake and challenging his push to label Israel a Jewish state, which some fear will alienate the country's significant Arab population. He also accused the ministers of being behind talks ""to kick out the prime minister."" ""In one word, they call this a putsch,"" Netanyahu said. ""You cannot have a government like this. It's impossible to govern like this."" 'Narrow political interests' In a Facebook post Tuesday, Livni said, ""The question in the election will not be who was the first to identify the threats and use them for political means, but who will deal with the threats in a responsible, level headed manner for the good of the country."" Lapid's centrist Yesh Atid party also fired back in a statement, in which it said Lapid told Netanyahu by phone that he expected the Prime Minister ""to act responsibly and to stop dragging the (Israeli military) and our soldiers into an election for your political needs."" Yesh Atid said that ""unnecessary elections ... will harm the economy and Israeli society, all for narrow political interests and a surrender to the ultra-orthodox parties, the powerful central committee of the Likud and outside lobby groups.""","Lawmakers approve the dissolution of parliament in a preliminary vote .

"Top officials at the campaign committee for House Republicans said Tuesday they weren't aware of anonymous Twitter accounts that were used ahead of the midterms to share internal polling data with outside groups, potentially violating campaign finance laws. ""I don't know anything about it,"" Oregon GOP Rep. Greg Walden, the chairman of the National Republican Campaign Committee, told CNN Tuesday. CNN reported Monday that NRCC and at least two outside groups -- American Crossroads and American Action Network --  masked their identities through anonymous Twitter accounts to share information about House races. Campaign finance experts said that pushed the limits of election laws that bar coordination between campaigns and outside groups, such as super PACs and nonprofits. Walden said he had heard about his group's involvement only after the CNN report so he couldn't comment in detail. When asked if he planned to investigate the behavior within the NRCC, Walden said he would ""look into it"" internally.  He suggested, however, that it wasn't a priority. ""We've got a few other things going on officially around here that I've got to deal with,"" he said. According to a source with knowledge of the activity, the groups posted internal polling data in shorthand on Twitter, a public forum, to avoid the appearance of coordination. The accounts, however, were not publicly affiliated with any of the groups who viewed or posted to them. While Walden denied knowledge of his group's activities, he defended the practice briefly when pressed about whether he thought using the accounts was appropriate. ""Publicly shared information is publicly shared information,"" Walden said. Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz, the NRCC vice-chair in charge of digital operations, also said he was unaware that this was happening. ""It's the first I've ever heard of it,"" he told CNN. It remains unclear whether the Federal Election Commission, the regulatory body charged with enforcing campaign finance laws, intends to address the groups' actions.

"Longpont, France (CNN)An intense manhunt for two brothers wanted in the Charlie Hebdo magazine massacre focused Thursday on northern France's Picardy region, where sources close to the investigation said a police helicopter might have spotted the suspects. Authorities believe that Cherif Kouachi, 32, and Said Kouachi, 34, entered a wooded area on foot, the sources told CNN's Chris Cuomo. Now investigators are using helicopters equipped with night vision tools to try to find them, the sources said. Earlier Thursday, a police helicopter glimpsed what investigators believed to be the fugitives in the same area, near Crepy-en-Valois, France. Police flooded the region, with heavily armed officers canvassing the countryside and forests in search of the killers. They came after a gas station attendant reportedly said the armed brothers threatened him near Villers-Cotterets in Picardy, stole gas and food, then drove off late Thursday morning. About 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the gas station, police blocked a rural country road leading to the French village of Longpont. Authorities have not commented in any detail, but pictures showed heavily armed police officers with shields and helmets in the blocked-off area. Hours later, a CNN team witnessed a convoy of 30 to 40 police vehicles leaving a site near Longpont. Prime Minister Manuel Valls put the Picardy region on the highest alert level, that same level that the entire Ile-de-France region, including Paris, is already under. As the search for the suspects intensified, details emerged about their past travels -- and possible training abroad. Said Kouachi went to Yemen for training, a French official told CNN.  The training he received included instruction from al Qaeda's affiliate there on how to fire weapons, a U.S. official said, citing information French intelligence provided to the United States. In addition to northern France, other parts of the country have also been under scrutiny. More than 80,000 police were deployed nationwide Thursday, France's interior minister said. Earlier Thursday, a gunman -- dressed in black and wearing what appeared to be a bulletproof vest, just like those who attacked the Charlie Hebdo offices -- shot and killed a female police officer in the Paris suburb of Montrouge. A municipal official was seriously wounded in that attack, France's interior minister said. One person was arrested, Paris Deputy Mayor Patrick Klugman said, though it's not known whether the shooter is still at large. Authorities have called that a terror attack, but they haven't connected it to Wednesday's slaying of 12 at the satirical magazine's Paris headquarters. Latest updates at 10:15 p.m. ET . • Investigators found empty containers and gasoline inside a car driven by the suspects in the Charlie Hebdo attack, according to U.S. and Western officials who say they received information from French intelligence about the vehicle. The suspects may have intended to use the items to make rudimentary explosives such as Molotov cocktails, the officials told CNN's Pamela Brown, Barbara Starr and Deborah Feyerick. • The head of Britain's MI5 security service told an audience in London that his agency was offering French intelligence officials its ""full support"" as France responds to Wednesday's terror attack in Paris. • Paris' iconic Eiffel Tower went dark Thursday night in remembrance of the victims of Wednesday's attack. • In the United States, the Paris Las Vegas resort said it also planned to dim the lights on its half-sized replica of the tower Thursday night. ""We stand with Paris in mourning the victims of the Charlie Hebdo attack,"" a spokeswoman for the hotel said. Charlie Hebdo to publish next Wednesday . While its business is satire, Charlie Hebdo has been the subject of serious venom. That includes its publication of cartoons lampooning the Muslim prophet, Mohammed, which some found very offensive. Satirical magazine is no stranger to controversy . The magazine's offices were fire-bombed after that in 2011, on the same day the magazine was due to release an issue with a cover that appeared to poke fun at Islamic law. It was attacked again Wednesday, when two masked men entered its offices not far from the famed Notre Dame Cathedral and the Place de la Bastille. On their way into the building, they asked exactly where the offices were. The men reportedly spoke fluent French with no accent. They barged in on the magazine's staff, while they were gathered for a lunchtime editorial meeting. The gunmen separated the men from the women and called out the names of cartoonists they intended to kill, said Dr. Gerald Kierzek, a physician who treated wounded patients and spoke with survivors. The shooting was not a random spray of bullets, but more of a precision execution, he said. The two said they were avenging the Prophet Mohammed and shouted ""Allahu akbar,"" which translates to ""God is great,"" Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins said. Cell phone cameras caught the two gunmen as they ran back out of the building, still firing. One of them ran up to a wounded police officer lying on a sidewalk and shot him point-blank. It was the deadliest attack in Europe since July 2011, when Anders Behring Brevik killed 77 people in attacks on government buildings in Oslo, Norway, and at a youth camp on the island of Utoya. But it won't stop Charlie Hebdo. Pelloux told CNN affiliate BFMTV that thousands of copies of the magazine will be published next Wednesday. Proceeds from the issue will go to victims' families, France's Le Monde newspaper reported. 'It was their only mistake' Authorities have released few details on why they've zeroed in on the Kouachi brothers. But they have pointed to one key clue found inside a getaway car the gunmen apparently used: Said Kouachi's identification card. It was discovered by investigators as they combed the vehicle for clues after impounding it. ""It was their only mistake,"" said Dominique Rizet, BFMTV's police and justice consultant, reporting that discovering the ID had helped French investigators . Other evidence also points to the brothers' involvement, according to U.S. officials briefed by French intelligence. Police hunting for the Kouachi brothers have searched residences in a number of towns, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said. Who are the suspects? An ISIS radio broadcast Thursday praised the attackers, calling them ""brave jihadists."" There was no mention of a claim of responsibility for the attack. Officials were running the brothers' names through databases to look for connections with ISIS and al Qaeda. A third suspect, 18-year-old Hamyd Mourad, turned himself in to police, a source close to the case told the AFP news agency. In French media and on social media, classmates of Mourad, who is in his final year of high school, said he was with them at school at the time of the attack. Cazeneuve said that nine people overall have been detained in connection with the Charlie Hebdo attack. But the Kouachi brothers remain on the run. 'Parisians will not be afraid' The victims' names were splashed Thursday across newspapers as heroes for freedom of expression. ""Liberty assassinated."" ""We are all Charlie Hebdo,"" the headlines blared. They included two police officers, Stephane Charbonnier -- a cartoonist and the magazine's editor, known as ""Charb"" -- and three other well-known cartoonists known by the pen names Cabu, Wolinski and Tignous. Autopsies on the victims were underway Thursday, Cazeneuve said. Flags flew at half-staff on public buildings and events were canceled Thursday, a national day of mourning. Crowds gathered in the rain in Paris in the victims' honor, many holding up media credentials and broke into applause as the silence ended. The bells of Notre Dame Cathedral tolled across the city. ""I can't remember such a day since 9/11,"" said Klugman, Paris' deputy mayor. ""The country really is in a kind of shutdown in respect and memory of the 12 people killed."" The day earlier, thousands poured into streets in hordes in a show of solidarity, holding up pens and chanting, ""We are Charlie!"" Similar demonstrations took place in cities in addition to Paris, including Rome, . On Thursday, demonstrators once again vowed that nothing would silence them. Standing in Paris' Place de la Republique, Lesley Martin sounded defiant as she waved an ""I am Charlie"" sign. ""I am not afraid,"" she said. ""Tonight I'm here and, if tomorrow I have to be here, I don't care if anybody comes and just wants to do something really bad here. I'm not afraid to die."" Cartoonists took a profane aim at the world . CNN's Atika Shubert reported from France, CNN's Greg Botelho and Catherine E. Shoichet wrote this story from Atlanta. CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Laura Smith-Spark, Pamela Brown, Barbara Starr, Deborah Feyerick, Jim Sciutto, Jim Bittermann, Ben Brumfield, Jethro Mullen, Khushbu Shah,  Anas Hamdan, Max Foster, Greg Morrison, Bryony Jones, Michael Martinez and Ray Sanchez also contributed to this report.","Items found in suspects' car could have been used to make explosives, officials say .

"A proposed new route through Nebraska for the controversial Keystone XL pipeline will require six to nine months of review under the normal process conducted by state and federal officials, a Nebraska official said Thursday. Mike Linder, director of the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality, told CNN that the proposal from TransCanada will undergo a public comment period followed by final revisions by the company before his agency does its full assessment. Noting the delay in the project over the route alteration, Linder said: ""We're still saying six to nine months."" TransCanada, the company proposing the pipeline from Canada's oil sands production in northern Alberta to the U.S. Gulf Coast, is seeking approval for a new route east of the initially proposed route, which went over an environmentally sensitive aquifer. A State Department official told CNN on Thursday that the Obama administration has not received a new permit application for the proposed alternate route for the northern portion of the pipeline. When the department receives an application, the next step would be to coordinate with Nebraska and other states along the route as they assess the proposal, the official said on background. Linder, a Republican who is a political appointee, said it is up to TransCanada to submit a permit application to the State Department. The 1,700-mile pipeline, intended to carry between 500,000 and 700,000 barrels of crude oil a day, has become a political lightning rod in the United States. Last year, the Obama administration postponed a decision on the pipeline until 2013, citing concerns raised by Nebraska officials and environmental groups about the original route near the vital Ogallala  Aquifer, which provides drinking water for much of Nebraska and is important for the state's agricultural economy. Environmentalists fear a burst in the pipeline would allow oil to seep into the massive water table. Republicans accused President Barack Obama of putting off the issue until after the November election to avoid angering his environmental allies. They forced the addition of a provision to speed up approval of the project  in the December debt ceiling agreement despite warnings by Obama that the 60-day timeline for a decision would guarantee rejection. In February, the State Department -- which has authority over international pipeline projects -- rejected the proposal on grounds that there was no alternative route to examine. TransCanada said then it would submit a new proposal for the route through Nebraska. Supporters, including the oil industry, say the pipeline would create jobs and reduce the country's dependence on oil imported from volatile regions. ""The stars are aligning for America's energy future and President Obama should make the right choice now and approve the entire Keystone XL pipeline,"" said Jack Gerard, president and CEO of the American Petroleum Institute, the main oil industry organization. ""The president's concerns about the sensitive Sand Hills area of Nebraska have been addressed. There are no more excuses. Mr. President, let's get this energy and job-creating project started now."" Opponents, including environmentalists, say that the pipeline might leak and that it would lock the United States into a particularly dirty form of crude oil that might ultimately end up being exported anyway. Under the timeline provided by Linder, hearings for public comment will be held and TransCanada will then consider that feedback to determine the specifics of the proposed alternate route. ""We will have a significant amount of time for public comment,"" Linder said. ""... They'll refine the route they really want to focus on as a preferred route and then do a more in-depth analysis on the ground of the actual route."" Once TransCanada submits that final proposal to his department, it should take 30 to 60 days for the review to be completed and a draft supplemental impact statement prepared, he said. Regarding the State Department's role, Linder said the situation is unique because under normal circumstances, TransCanada would have an application pending. However, the initial application was rejected, so the company must file a new one. Republican leaders are pressuring Obama and Democrats to speed approval of the pipeline. ""With this new route submitted and the state of Nebraska acting to move forward, the president is running out of excuses for blocking the Keystone pipeline any longer,"" House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, told CNN on Wednesday, noting that a ""veto-proof majority"" in the House of Representatives supports the project. The House on Wednesday approved a Republican bill that aims to fast-track the Keystone project as part of another 90-day extension of federal transportation funding. The 293-127 vote allows Boehner to begin negotiations with Senate Democrats over a longer-term funding measure for road, rail and bridge projects. Obama announced in March that he would approve the southern portion of the pipeline, which runs from Cushing, Oklahoma -- a key repository of U.S. oil -- to the Gulf. He had said he was always in favor of permitting that portion, even when he blocked the full project. Currently, there are not enough pipelines to take the oil being produced in Canada and North Dakota to refineries and terminals on the Gulf. That means Midwest refineries can pay lower prices to get it. Giving the Canadian oil easier access to the Gulf means the glut in the Midwest goes away, making it more expensive for the region, but it would increase the amount of that oil available to global markets.","A Nebraska official says reviewing a pipeline route usually takes six to nine months .

"(CNN)French police say two suspects in Wednesday's terrorist attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine are still on the loose after escaping onto the streets of Paris. In a statement on their website, French national police ask for information on the whereabouts of suspects Cherif Kouachi and Said Kouachi, warning that both could be armed and dangerous. Police released photos of the two men, who Paris Deputy Mayor Patrick Klugman told CNN are brothers in their 30s. Police found an ID document of Said Kouachi at the scene of the shooting, CNN affiliate BFMTV reported. ""It was their only mistake,"" said Dominique Rizet, BFMTV's police and justice consultant, reporting that the discovery helped the investigation. Citing sources, the Agence France Presse news agency reported that an 18-year-old suspect in the attack had surrendered to police. CNN has not independently confirmed whether the suspect has surrendered. Police fanned out across France in an intense manhunt for the suspects, who were masked and dressed in black when they burst into the satirical magazine's office Wednesday, killing 12 people. A tactical unit was deployed in an operation about a 144 kilometers (about 90 miles) from Paris in Reims, France, following the attack, CNN affiliate BFMTV reported. Authorities haven't revealed details about the target of the operation, but speculation surged in French media that investigators could be closing in on the suspects. French authorities vowed to step up security and apprehend those responsible. ""Everything will be done to arrest (the attackers),"" French President Francois Hollande said in a speech Wednesday night. ""... We also have to protect all public places. Security forces will be deployed everywhere there can be the beginning"" of a threat. It's too soon to say whether the suspects were operating alone, CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said. Some experts warned that how well the gunmen wielded their weapons, hid their identities and apparently planned their escape showed a marked difference from previous ""lone wolf"" attacks -- and could be a game changer. Charlie Hebdo: Satirical magazine is no stranger to controversy . Video shows gunman target seemingly wounded man . These developments come after at least two heavily armed men entered the Charlie Hebdo office in Paris' 11th district, close to Place de la Bastille, and opened fire, Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins said. The gunmen said they were avenging the Prophet Mohammed and shouted ""Allahu akbar,"" which translates to ""God is great,"" Molins said. A witness who works in the office opposite the magazine's told BFMTV that he saw two hooded men, dressed in black, enter the building heavily armed. ""We then heard them open fire inside, with many shots,"" he said. ""We were all evacuated to the roof. After several minutes, the men fled, after having continued firing in the middle of the street."" The men reportedly spoke fluent French with no accent. One unsettling video, posted to YouTube, shows two men shooting on a Paris street, then walking up to and firing point-blank at a seemingly wounded man as he lay on the ground. Video shows a gunman approaching his getaway car and raising his finger in the air in what appears to be a signal, possibly to another vehicle or other people who might have played a role in the attack, a Western intelligence source briefed on the French investigation told CNN. In addition to the 12 dead, 11 people were wounded, including four in ""serious condition,"" the prosecutor said. Two police officers were among those killed, the French President said. Charlie Hebdo editor and cartoonist Stephane Charbonnier, known as ""Charb,"" is among the dead in the attack, a police spokesman in the district where the office is located told CNN. At least three other well-known cartoonists -- known by the pen names Cabu, Wolinski and Tignous -- were also killed. 'Parisians will not be afraid' At an event in Paris' Place de la Republique, demonstrators held up pens in honor of the slain cartoonists and chanted, ""We are Charlie!"" Pictures posted online showed similar demonstrations in other cities, including Rome, Berlin and Barcelona. ""Parisians will not be afraid,"" Klugman said. ""We will fight terrorism with our common values, freedom, freedom of speech, freedom of the press. ... We are at war, but we still want to behave as a leading democracy."" Armed soldiers could be seen standing guard outside monuments, in transit stations and elsewhere in well-trafficked spots around France by Wednesday evening. Prime Minister Manuel Valls raised France's security to its highest level -- ""attack alert"" -- after the Charlie Hebdo bloodshed. That means there will be reinforced security at media company offices, major stores, religious centers and on public transport, his office said in a statement. U.S. counterterrorism agencies are looking at a number of groups, including ISIS and al Qaeda, that might be responsible for the attack. Charlie Hebdo has been singled out as a target for Islamist extremists in al Qaeda's publication, Inspire. Police impounded a black Citroen in northeastern Paris similar to the one purportedly used by the attackers as a getaway car. Video from CNN affiliate BFMTV shows the vehicle being towed from Porte de Pantin, in Paris' 19th district. Investigators will do a complete DNA work-up on the Citroen, including soil signatures that might suggest where the gunmen came from, a Western intelligence source briefed on the probe told CNN. The same source said that French authorities are searching all travel records from the past 17 days to see whether any of the attackers entered the European nation over the holidays. This includes checks at Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports, as well as whatever limited information is available from train stations. Thursday will be a national day of mourning for those killed in the attack, Hollande said. He asked for a moment of reflection Thursday and said flags will be at half-staff for three days. Satirical magazine has drawn anger . Charlie Hebdo is no stranger to controversy for lampooning a variety of subjects, including Christianity. But what it's done on Islam has gotten the most attention and garnered the most vitriol. Its last tweet before Wednesday's attack featured a cartoon of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The magazine has a controversial history of depicting Mohammed, often in an unfavorable light, which has angered many Muslims around the world. Earlier cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed spurred protests and the burning of the magazine's office three years ago. In November 2011, Charlie Hebdo's office was firebombed the day it was due to publish a cover making fun of Islamic law. A year later, in an interview with Le Monde newspaper, Charbonnier gave little indication that he planned to change Charlie Hebdo's ways. ""It may sound pompous,"" he said, ""but I'd rather die standing than live on my knees."" The attack on the magazine spurred a wave of support for the publication and its practices around France and the world. On social media, people tweeted past covers from the magazine as well as the words ""Je suis Charlie,"" or ""I am Charlie.""

"Aldo the German shepherd and his human companions in law enforcement won an important Supreme Court appeal on Tuesday over vehicle searches for drugs and contraband. The justices found that a positive ""hit"" from the sniff of a well trained police dog could establish probable cause for the search of a vehicle. ""The question-- similar to every inquiry intro probable cause-- is whether all the facts surrounding a dog's alert, viewed through the lens of common sense, would make a reasonably prudent person think that a search would reveal contraband or evidence of a crime,"" said Justice Elena Kagan. ""And here, Aldo's did."" This case and a separate and still pending appeal over police intrusions into homes and cars could have a far-reaching impact on when a person's private contents can be subjected to a search without clear probable cause or a valid warrant. Dogs at center of police search arguments . The Constitution's Fourth Amendment grants the ""right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures."" The issue of citizen privacy has been particularly acute since the 2001 al Qaeda attacks on the United States. Federal and state governments have stepped up surveillance of suspected terrorists and their allies and high-risk targets, like government buildings and shopping malls. The case decided by the Supreme Court on Tuesday involved Clayton Harris, who was stopped by a sheriff's deputy in Liberty County outside Tallahassee in 2006 for an expired license tag. The officer brought in a German shepherd police dog, Aldo, who focused on the truck's door handle. A subsequent search produced pills in the vehicle that are used to make methamphetamine. Harris was charged and later pleaded no contest, but the state high court later reversed the conviction. Those justices found the dog unreliable. A few weeks after the initial search, Harris was stopped and the dog again alerted the door handle for the presence of drugs. This time, none were found. The Florida high court concluded that the state's general assertion a dog was sufficiently ""trained"" and ""certified"" was not enough alone to establish probable cause justifying vehicle searches. But the U.S. Supreme Court disagreed, saying Aldo's training records established that he was reliable in detecting drugs and that Harris ""failed to undermine that showing."" The Supreme Court has in recent years generally given law enforcement some latitude to conduct its in a heightened security environment, but not without some checks. The current cases also come as recent studies have raised questions about the accuracy of canine drug alerts. Florida state officials applauded the opinion. ""This victory is paramount to preserving our law enforcement officers' ability to use police dog alerts to locate illegal drugs and arrest those who possess them,"" said Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. ""The Supreme Court correctly held that a police dog's reliability is determined through a common-sense evaluation of the relevant circumstances, rather than through a rigid set of judge-created requirements,"" Bondi said. The case is: Florida v. Harris (11-817).","Court says alerts from trained dogs can trigger probable cause for search of car .

"This week, I will campaign for Gov. Mitt Romney. I believe this election will and should be about moving America back from the edge of the abyss on which we stand, where our debt and spending threaten to overwhelm and drown us. Romney's belief in free markets, limited government and trade make him the clear choice to lead our country come January. I do not, however, support a call for intervention in Syria. And, if such intervention were being contemplated, it is absolutely necessary that Congress give any such authority to the president. No president, Republican or Democrat, has the unilateral power to take our nation to war without the authority of the legislature. At times, I have been encouraged by Romney's foreign policy. I agree with his call to end the war in Afghanistan sooner rather than later and with his skepticism of, and call for reform in, foreign aid, but I am a bit dismayed by his foreign policy speech Monday, titled ""Mantle of Leadership."" Romney chose to criticize President Obama for seeking to cut a bloated Defense Department and for not being bellicose enough in the Middle East, two assertions with which I cannot agree. Defense and war spending has grown 137% since 2001. That kind of growth is not sustainable. Opinion: Romney's sorta-kinda call to arms . Adm. Michael Mullen stated earlier this year that the biggest threat to our national security is our debt. If debt is our gravest threat, adding to the debt by expanding military spending further threatens our national security. While I would always stand up for America and preserve our ability to defend ourselves, a less aggressive foreign policy along with an audit of the Pentagon could save tens of billions of dollars each year without sacrificing our defense. To dismiss either idea is to miss the very compromise that will enable us to balance our budget. That compromise would be for conservatives to admit that not every dollar spent on the military is sacred or well-spent and for liberals to admit that not every dollar spent on domestic entitlements and welfare is necessary. In North Africa and the Middle East, our problem has not been a lack of intervention. In the past 10 years we have fought two full wars there, and bombed or sent troops into several others. This past year, President Obama illegally began a war with Libya, taking sides with the rebels to unseat an admittedly bad man in Moammar Gadhafi. There were several problems with this policy: First, the president did not seek or get the necessary constitutional authority from Congress for this military action. If our Constitution is to mean anything it must be applied even in times of war, when those seeking to exercise power do not find it expedient. Just as importantly, the Libyan rebels were assisted with virtually no one in the administration or in Congress demanding to know who these people were that we were arming and propping up. No one seemed to understand that in toppling Libya's dictatorship, we were leaving in its wake an unformed, unorganized government without a centralized structure, one that would have a difficult time keeping order among the more than 100 tribes that make up Libya. This ""act first, think later"" foreign policy has real consequences. We've seen our embassies and consulates stormed in more than one country. Our diplomats and security team were killed. Our flag is being burned, our country mocked. The proper response to this would be to step back and think of whether we really need to be involved in these countries in the way we have been. Instead, both parties rush headlong into more places they don't understand, exemplified Monday by Romney urging action to arm Syrian rebels and topple President Bashar al-Assad. But just who are these rebels? What will they do when in power? Is this really in our vital national interest? Opinion: Romney's foreign policy twilight zone . We've been 10 years in Afghanistan and we can't identify friend from foe. Do you think we can, with certainty, identify friend and foe in Syria? Before taking our country closer to war, shouldn't we at least ask the viewpoint of the significant Christian population in Syria? News reports indicate they are wary of the rebels and are either sitting the fight out or siding with al-Assad. Al-Assad is by no means a saint but Christians flocked to Syria from a war-torn Iraq because they feared al-Assad less than the Islamic government we brought into being. Before getting deeply involved, should someone ask: Are these rebels going to be implementing the death penalty for criticism of Islam? There is ample evidence the rebels are being funded and armed by the most extreme Islamist elements and governments in the region. Is that where we want our funds and weapons to end up? We need to stop and think before we act. I am not an isolationist or a pacifist. I heartily reject both labels. I believe in engagement in the world, with trade, commerce, diplomacy and a foreign policy that projects the greatness of America and her people. I would not hesitate to vote to send American troops to war to protect our country and our vital national security interests. Opinion: Obama, Romney -- Ignore Afghanistan war at your own peril . But we are in too many places, too often, and we don't seem to even know the reason -- or where we will end up when we're done. This foreign policy has created more enemies than it has vanquished. It has siphoned trillions of America's dollars. It has cost tens of thousands of casualties in the loss of the lives and limbs of our soldiers. We owe it to ourselves, our soldiers and our children to take a more careful look at our foreign policy, to not rush into war, and to not attempt to score political points with wrongheaded policy ideas.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. State Department is unable to account for most of $1.2 billion in funding that it gave to DynCorp International to train Iraqi police, a government report said Tuesday. An International Police Liaison Officer hired by DynCorp stands near new Iraqi police recruits in Falluja, Iraq. ""The bottom line is that State can't account for where it went,"" said Glenn D. Furbish, who was involved in putting together the 20-page report for the special inspector general for Iraq reconstruction (SIGIR). The Department of State's Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) ""did not have the information needed to identify what DynCorp provided under the contract or how funds were spent,"" the report said. As a result, the audit agency announced it has suspended its oversight of the agency's project until INL gathers the information. ""Their records are just not detailed,"" Furbish said Monday in a telephone interview. ""From an audit perspective, we've identified the problem; they're working to rectify the problem."" Though Iraqi police have indeed been trained and equipment has been provided under the contract, invoices and supporting paperwork submitted by DynCorp ""were in disarray,"" the report said. In addition, INL ""had not validated the accuracy"" of invoices received prior to last October, and ""INL does not know specifically what it received for most of the $1.2 billion in expenditures under its DynCorp contract for the Iraqi Police Training Program."" The lack of controls ""created an environment vulnerable to waste and fraud,"" the report said. Furbish, an accountant by training who spent two years in Iraq, added, ""It's like so much else that happened in Baghdad ... there was just a massive quantity of work and too few people in place to do it. They just essentially did not have the staff to monitor what was going on. ""Bills came in; they paid the bills, but they don't know what they paid for and they don't know what they've gotten."" Furbish, who has carried out audits for the Government Accountability Office for three decades, said the projected time line of three to five years to rectify the problem ""is not atypical"" for U.S. projects carried out in Iraq since the ouster of President Saddam Hussein. ""Baghdad is its own arena,"" he said. ""Contract control has been a major shortcoming across the board."" In addition to having too few properly trained people, problems arose from the difficulties inherent in traveling within Iraq and from ""the rush to get reconstruction activities under way before we actually had a full structure in place to manage them,"" he said. Asked whether the full structure is currently in place more than four years after the U.S.-led invasion, he said. ""It continues to be a problem."" In a letter to SIGIR, INL Acting Assistant Secretary Elizabeth Verville said her agency has made ""significant progress in correcting past contract management problems"" and ""is dedicated to addressing our past contracting problems and systematically strengthening contract management and oversight."" She said invoice processing delays will be reduced as staffing is beefed up in Baghdad. State Department spokeswoman Susan Pittman said a number of reforms have been made since January. ""We are committed to continuous improvement,"" she said. The Washington-based staff of four will soon be increased to 11, and the Baghdad-based staff of five will be augmented to seven ""as soon as they all have their clearances,"" she said. Still, she acknowledged, it will take years to get the paperwork current. ""It isn't an easy process,"" she said. ""There is a huge need, a huge, urgent need and there were not enough people to be able to fill that void,"" she said. ""That is something that we are in the process of doing."" Gregory Lagana, a spokesman for DynCorp, said the company's work in Iraq is a ""really complex program. ... We buy weapons, body armor, vehicles, communications equipment -- that all belongs to the State Department."" Sometimes, he said, ""it's coded wrong or double-billed. We actually find a lot of that ourselves in the normal auditing process."" Tuesday's report is the second in a series of financial reviews ordered by Congress and carried out by SIGIR looking into large Iraqi Relief and Reconstruction Fund projects. The first report, issued three months ago, criticized officials with the U.S. Agency for International Development for lack of oversight of their contract with Bechtel. Bechtel is a privately held, U.S. conglomerate of engineering, construction, and project management companies. The series of at least 10 reports will be finalized by spring, he said.

"The long-dormant Middle East peace efforts got new life on Friday. An agreement has been reached that ""establishes a basis for resuming direct final status negotiations between"" Palestinians and Israel, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said in Amman, Jordan. ""This is a significant and welcome step forward,"" Kerry said. This came as Kerry visited the Middle East this week and came up with a formula for reanimating peace talks between Israel and the Palestinian territories, a source close to the talks said. He has been working intensely with the Palestinian side to get them on board. Earlier Friday, in a meeting in Amman, Jordan, Kerry presented the plan to Palestinian chief peace negotiator Saeb Erakat in hopes that it will entice the Palestinians back to the negotiating table. Kerry arrived in Ramallah in the West Bank on Friday afternoon and began a meeting with President Mahmoud Abbas for the third time during his current trip to the Middle East. New city offers vision of better life in West Bank . Talks could begin soon in Washington, according to the official Palestinian Authority news agency, Wafa, which quoted the authority's spokesman, Nabil abu Rudaineh. Abu Rudaineh said ""certain details"" were still in need of solutions, but ""if things go well, Kerry will extend an invitation to Saeb Erekat and the representative of the Israeli side, to meet him in Washington, to hold primary talks in the coming few days."" Israeli Justice Minister Tzipi Livni lauded the prospect of peace. ""These past few months were long, filled with doubt and cynicism,"" Livni said in a statement. ""But now, four years of political stagnation are coming to an end. ""I know that, despite this being an opportunity, once the negotiations begin they will be complex -- but I am convinced with all my heart that this is the right thing for our future, our security, our economy and Israel's values,"" Livni said. She expressed respect for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ""for making the decisions representing Israel's important interests, as well for American Secretary of State, John Kerry, which led us and the Palestinians into the negotiations room."" In the Palestinian territory of Gaza, however, Hamas dismissed the renewed effort for peace talks. ""This negotiation will be useless. It is not going to achieve anything for the Palestinian people. It will not help the prisoner issue, the border issue or the land issue,"" the group said in a statement. Israel imposed an economic blockade on Gaza shortly after Hamas was elected to run the Gaza government in 2006. Kerry said the agreement is still in the process of being formalized, so ""we are absolutely not going to talk about the elements now,"" he said. If everything goes as expected, representatives for the two sides will join Kerry in Washington ""for initial talks within the next week or so, and a further announcement will be made by all of us at that time."" ""Any speculation or reports you may read in the media ... are conjecture ... because the people who know the facts are not talking about them,"" he said. Talks based on land swaps, pre-1967 borders? One of the reports Kerry might have been referencing was a Reuters report quoting an Israeli official who said the Jewish state agreed to a plan for peace talks based on pre-1967 borders and land swaps. It would be in line with a decades-old United Nations resolution calling on Israel to release territories it gained during a war, a demand that Israel has historically fought. But it would help create contiguous borders for a future Palestinian state that would coexist next to a Jewish state. Israel's official reaction to the report has been denial. Mark Regev, a spokesman for Netanyahu, rejected the news agency story and questioned who in the government would have made the assertions. Kerry had set up shop in Amman, Jordan, where he has already advertised the plan to the Arab League and to Abbas. Abbas briefed politicians in Ramallah after returning from his initial meetings with Kerry. News of the plan triggered a reaction Friday from Mustafa Barghouti, a prominent Palestinian legislator. ""We need written commitments that there are terms of reference including commitment to 1967 borders. We need affirmation or guarantees that there will be no settlement expansions,"" he said. Other Palestinians would not accept negotiations as long as they continued to grow, he added. Israel has recently announced plans to add on to West Bank settlements, drawing angry responses from Palestinians and criticism from Israel's Western allies. The major bones of contention in negotiations are: . • The status of Jerusalem. Israel regards the entire city as its capital. The Palestinians regard East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state. • Jewish settlements in the West Bank. The land is known as Judea and Samaria in Jewish history, and Israelis say they believe that territory is part of the Jewish state. The Palestinians say the West Bank is Palestinian land. They also say they've been mistreated in their own land for years by Israel's government, the military and settlers. • Security. Israel has said it wants to be assured of the safety of its citizens from attacks by Palestinian militants in any peace agreement. • The status of the Palestinians, who mostly departed Israel during two wars: one that led to the state's founding in 1948, and one in 1967. Palestinians say they were driven out. War spoils . Israel took over East Jerusalem, the West Bank, Gaza, Sinai and the Golan Heights after it defeated Arab states in the Six-Day War in 1967. In a series of moves following its capture, Israel effectively annexed East Jerusalem, putting it and other adjacent areas in the West Bank under Israeli government control. Since then, Israel has forged a peace treaty with Egypt and returned Sinai to the country. It later unilaterally departed from Gaza, now run by Hamas. Israel occupies the Palestinian territory of the West Bank and part of Syria's Golan Heights. For years, Israel and the Palestinian Authority have made attempts to negotiate, but have repeatedly failed to get the process moving.

"Washington (CNN) -- Army Master Sgt. Benjamin A. Stevenson, 36, was on his 10th tour of duty in the war zones of Afghanistan and Iraq when he was killed Thursday in a remote area of eastern Afghanistan. Few details are available on the circumstances that led to the death of the highly decorated soldier, from Canyon Lake, Texas. However, a U.S. military official has now confirmed to CNN that Stevenson was the only U.S. casualty of a brutal two-day firefight against an al Qaeda-related group that erupted when U.S. and Afghan troops attacked an insurgent encampment, killing nearly 80 foreign fighters. That single piece of information is a rare glimpse into the world of U.S. special operations forces who have done more tours than most in the last decade. Special forces tours of duty typically last six to eight months, compared to regular combat tours of one year. Many troops have spent more time away from home than at home, but little is said about what they do these days in fighting insurgent strongholds. The official who confirmed Stevenson was part of this raid declined to be named because he was discussing the Army's Special Operations Command. Stevenson was part of a U.S. and Afghan special operations mission that went in to attack the area in Afghanistan's Paktika province. The camp they attacked and the fighters there were part of the so-called Haqqanni network, which is responsible for many recent attacks in Afghanistan and is closely tied to al Qaeda. The Haqqanis traditionally rely on Afghan and Pakistani fighters, but in this instance most of the fighters there who were killed were Arabs and Chechens, brought into Afghanistan from Pakistan. That alone is a worrisome trend. A second U.S. military official tells CNN that the US is seeing the Haqqanis increasingly turn to foreign fighters they bring into Afghanistan. ""This is how they are expanding their capabilities,"" the official said. The U.S. believes this camp was an assembly and training point for these foreign fighters to stage attacks across Afghanistan. During the two-day firefight against the camp, the U.S. troops found several caves and fortified bunkers. Airstrikes were called in using missile-equipped helicopters, fighter jets dropping precision weapons and unmanned drones. Coalition forces were led to the camp by former insurgents, but it's not clear if the extent of the opposition was immediately clear to the coalition. When the dust finally cleared, Stevenson was the only fatality. The U.S. military, still cloaked in secrecy, won't say how he perished.","Man who died in firefight was on 10th tour of duty .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Former Secretary of State Colin Powell said Tuesday that he has been the victim of racial profiling but believes Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. could have been more patient with the police officer who arrested him. Former Secretary of State Colin Powell told Larry King that    he has been subject to racial profiling. At the same time, Powell also faulted the Cambridge (Massachusetts) Police Department for escalating the situation beyond a reasonable level. ""I think Skip [Gates], perhaps in this instance, might have waited a while, come outside, talked to the officer and that might have been the end of it,"" Powell said in an interview with CNN's Larry King. ""I think he should have reflected on whether or not this was the time to make that big a deal.  Watch what Powell would advise Gates » . ""I think in this case the situation was made much more difficult on the part of the Cambridge Police Department,"" Powell said. ""Once they felt they had to bring Dr. Gates out of the house and to handcuff him, I would've thought at that point, some adult supervision would have stepped in and said 'OK look, it is his house. Let's not take this any further, take the handcuffs off, good night Dr. Gates.' "" Gates, a top African-American scholar, was arrested July 16 for disorderly conduct outside his Cambridge, Massachusetts, home after police responded to a report of a possible burglary. The charge was later dropped. Powell said that under the circumstances, Gates may not have been in the appropriate frame of mind to best handle the situation. ""He was just home from China, just home from New York. All he wanted to do was get to bed. His door was jammed and so he was in a mood where he said something,"" Powell said. He recalled a lesson he was taught as a child: ""When you're faced with an officer who is trying to do his job and get to the bottom of something, this is not the time to get in an argument with him. ""There is no African-American in this county who has not been exposed to this kind of situation,"" Powell said. ""Do you get angry? Yes. Do you manifest that anger? Do you protest? Do you try to get things fixed? But it's the better course of action to try and take it easy and don't let your anger make the current situation worse."" The former secretary of state said he has been racially profiled ""many times,"" including an incident that took place while he was the national security adviser to President Reagan. ""Nobody thought I could possibly be the national security adviser to the president. I was just a black guy at Reagan National Airport,"" Powell said. ""And it was only when I went to the counter and said, 'Is my guest here waiting for me?' that someone said, 'Oh, you're Gen. Powell.' It was inconceivable to him that a black guy could be the national security adviser."" When asked how he dealt with the situation, Powell said, ""You just suck it up -- what are you going to do? It was a teaching point for him. 'Yes, I'm the national security adviser, I'm black, and watch, I can do the job.' "" In the interview, Powell touched on other issues, ranging from North Korea to U.S. figures such as Sarah Palin and Rush Limbaugh. While North Korea may be ""bizarre,"" he said, their negotiators are second to none. ""They are some of the best, toughest negotiators I've ever dealt with,"" Powell said. ""And you can read the whole history of our negotiations with North Korea, going back to the Korean armistice discussion, and you'll find they know what their negotiating positions are, and they will drive you crazy, and they will use your impatience against you."" The former secretary praised the United States' current top diplomat, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Powell said Clinton was handling North Korean relations ""properly"" by insisting that dialogue with Pyongyang be limited to the six-party framework. Powell said Clinton seems to be ""in the mold of almost all secretaries I have known."" Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, he said, is a ""fascinating figure ... you have got to hand it to her."" Palin transferred power to Gov. Sean Parnell on Sunday. He repeated his assessment that the former Republican vice presidential candidate had not been ready for the Oval Office last fall, but said she was worth watching. ""Apparently, she is going to re-enter public life ... . We will have to see what her plans are,"" he said Tuesday. ""I don't know if she is doing all of this for political purposes or just to start a new life in the wonderful world of speaking. And we will all be watching with great interest."" Powell, who has previously been critical of radio host Rush Limbaugh, restated his opinion that members of his party ought to do the same. ""The problem I'm having with the [Republican] Party right now is that when he says something that I consider to be completely outrageous and I respond to it, I would like to see other members of the party do likewise, but they don't,"" he said.  Watch Powell talk about Limbaugh and the GOP » . Asked whether he thinks Republicans are afraid to take on Limbaugh, Powell pointed out that several prominent Republicans have criticized Limbaugh but that ""within 24 hours, they were backing away because there is a strong base of support for Mr. Limbaugh."" Powell discussed his reaction to the news that then-Sen. Barack Obama had won the presidency. ""I cried,"" he said. Powell was in Hong Kong to speak to Chinese leaders, and it was late morning in Hong Kong when the final votes were cast in the United States. ""I just sat down in a chair and said 'By God, we did it.' There were people who said America could not do this, America would not do this, but he did do it."" The former top diplomat also had some advice for now-President Obama. ""Everybody comes into office -- the new president -- and they're told by everybody 'You've got to get it all done in the first year.' Or 'the first hundred days are important,'"" Powell said. "" ... You have to have a main attack, as we say in the military. You have to make sure you're focusing on things that are most important. Not try to have a dozen main attacks at once because you end up sort of frittering your energy and your troops. ""Now President Obama is out there trying to solve all of the problems he said he would solve. And I think that he and his staff over time will start to do a better job, in my judgment, of setting priorities."" Powell didn't limit his advice to the president. He also offered counsel to his party. ""If the party is going to succeed in the future, the advice I'm giving to my Republican friends is you've got to find some way to reach out and draw moderates and independents more toward the right so that we can build a party that will win,"" Powell said. ""A base, as I've said before -- the base is no particular use if all you can do is sit on it and you can't build on it.""","Ex-secretary of state says Harvard professor should have stopped to think .

"(CNN) -- Authorities have charged a 21-year-old Hawaii man with ""making false statements in a matter involving international terrorism,"" the U.S. Justice Department said. The charge centers around a one-way ticket that authorities allege Abdel Hameed Shehadeh purchased from New York City to Islamabad, Pakistan. Shehadeh originally told investigators that the purpose of his trip was to visit an Islamic university and attend a friend's engagement party. But he later admitted to FBI agents in Hawaii that he bought the ticket in order to join a fighting group such as the Taliban, according to a criminal complaint unsealed Monday in New York. Pakistani officials denied his entry into the country in June 2008, the complaint said, and several weeks later Shehadeh attempted to join the U.S. Army at a recruiting station in New York's Times Square. The complaint alleges that Shehadeh wanted to deploy to Iraq, desert and fight against the U.S. military alongside Iraqi insurgents. Shehadeh -- who was born and raised in New York -- told authorities that he wanted to enlist for career opportunities and benefits, the Justice Department said in a news release. ""The real purpose, it is alleged, was not to join U.S. forces, but to wage war against them. Stopping one prospective terrorist can prevent untold numbers of casualties,"" said Janice Fedarcyk, who heads the FBI's New York office. The complaint also alleges that Shehadeh ""was the creator and administrator of multiple websites which advocated violent jihad against the west."" One of the sites contained photos of jihadist fighters, a speech by an al Qaeda leader, an audio recording of Yemeni-American cleric and militant Anwar al-Awlaki reciting a book on jihad, the complaint says. To promote one of the sites, according to the complaint, Shehadeh posted on another site: ""It is time for the Muslims to start practicing our freedom of speech. ... My brothers of revolution Islam, I am with you as long as you keep struggling. Trust me there are many brothers and sisters in America that are ready to speak up. They just need a push."" The complaint also says Shehadeh purchased an airline ticket to travel to Amman, Jordan, in October 2008, but was not allowed to enter the country by Jordanian authorities. The complaint does not say why authorities did not allow him to enter Pakistan and Jordan. In 2009, Shehadeh moved to Hawaii, and later attempted to travel to Somalia. But U.S. authorities informed him he had been placed on the ""no fly"" list and could not travel there, according to the complaint. In an April conversation with the FBI, Shehadeh said that if he had been allowed to enter Pakistan, ""without a doubt, he would have joined the Taliban,"" the complaint said. Shehadeh will be prosecuted in the Eastern District of New York, the Justice Department said. A cousin, Bader Suleiman, called Shehadeh ""a nice kid"" and said he was surprised by news of his arrest. Shehadeh spent almost a year in a hospital recovering from a serious car accident three years ago, Suleiman said. He moved to Hawaii to study after graduating from Tottenville High School on New York City's Staten Island, Suleiman said.","Authorities allege Abdel Shehadeh lied about a planned trip to Pakistan .
The FBI says he intended to join the Taliban there, but originally claimed otherwise .

"Chalk one up for the first two bulls at Spain's top annual bullfighting festival. Between them, they gored or bashed three bullfighters, putting them out of action, and forcing authorities to suspend a bullfight at the San Isidro Festival in Madrid for the first time in 35 years, said a spokesman for Las Ventas bullring, who by custom is not identified. In front of a sold-out crowd of 24,000 at the historic bullring on Tuesday -- and a national television audience -- the first bull, weighing just over half a ton (532 kilograms) gored the first bullfighter, David Mora, in the left leg.  He had to leave to get medical treatment. But the tradition says the bull must die, so in stepped the second bullfighter, Antonio Nazare, who finished him off. Next, it was time for the second bull, weighing slightly more than the first at 537 kilograms. He would prove even more dangerous. The third bullfighter, Saul Jimenez Fortes, started with him, but Nazare, who as second bullfighter on the card would normally have faced the second bull, exercised his right to step in, replacing Jimenez in the ring. But the second bull promptly butted Nazare so hard in the knees that he had to be carted off to the on-site infirmary. That left Jimenez as the last bullfighter standing, so he again entered the ring, still facing the second bull. As he moved in for the kill, he was gored in the right leg, but managed to stay afoot until the bull died. Then Jimenez joined his colleagues in the infirmary. There were still four more bulls to fight that day, out of the usual six on the card. But no more bullfighters in the shiny suit of lights. So authorities called it off. The San Isidro festival, named for Madrid's patron saint, features 31 fights this year, from May 9 to June 8. It pays top dollar to the top bullfighters. The three injured bullfighters are recovering in a hospital. And the four bulls that didn't fight were returned to their ranches, safe and sound.

"(CNN) -- Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer on Friday signed the state's immigration bill into law. It is considered to be among the toughest legislation in the nation. What does the Arizona law do? Arizona's law orders immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times and requires police to question people if there's reason to suspect they're in the United States illegally. It also targets those who hire illegal immigrant laborers or knowingly transport them. Are other states considering similar legislation? Michael Hethmon, general counsel for the Immigration Reform Law Institute, helped draft the language of the Arizona bill. Hethmon said lawmakers from four other states have approached him asking for advice on how they can do the same thing where they live. He declined to identify which states, citing attorney-client privilege. State laws relating to immigration have increased in recent years, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. In 2005, 300 bills were introduced. The next year, that number nearly doubled, and in 2007, more than 1,500 bills were introduced. Another 1,305 were introduced in 2008, and about 1,500 were considered in 2009. About 15 percent of those were enacted, dealing with issues such as driver's licenses, health and education. About 1,000 bills have been brought up so far this year. What do opponents say? Critics, including immigrant advocates and the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona, say they are concerned the law will foster racial profiling, arguing that most police officers don't have enough training to look past race while investigating a person's legal status. Read remarks made Friday by president, Arizona governor . Is federal immigration legislation coming? Democrats tell CNN that if they don't get Republican commitments soon, they likely will push to move a bill without GOP support. Democratic sources said the chances of passing immigration reform in that scenario this year are slim, but they want to make clear to key constituencies they are at least trying. President Obama is still pushing for a bill, though. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina is the only GOP senator on board, but he has told Democrats they will lose his support unless they find another Republican. Obama recently called Sen. Scott Brown, R-Massachusetts, to try to get him on board, a Brown spokeswoman said. On Thursday, Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, said in a statement that during tough economic conditions, Americans are ""dubious"" about immigration reform. He said the White House and Congress should not immediately take up the issue -- but instead ""take targeted steps to deal with the crisis at the border, increase the usage of the E-Verify program, and enhance prosecutions of employers who knowingly hire illegal workers."" The last immigration reform efforts in Congress were in 2005 when Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, and the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, Brown's predecessor, introduced a bipartisan bill that aimed to implement guest-worker programs and ways for more illegal immigrants to become citizens. The McCain-Kennedy bill, however, never came up for a vote in the Senate. Other legislative efforts have failed to gain momentum. CNN's Dana Bash, Ed Hornick and Kristi Keck contributed to this report.","NEW: Arizona's governor signs controversial immigration bill into law .

"The United States needs to overhaul its support for clean energy research to keep recent gains alive as subsidies that have fueled a boom in the field expire, researchers urged Wednesday. Federal support for clean power ""will have been largely dismantled by the end of 2014,"" a new report by a trio of think tanks warns. More than 70% of the programs now on the books -- many of them part of the Obama administration's 2009 economic stimulus bill -- are set to expire in the next two years, the report concludes. ""Neither Congress' attitude or the public purse right now is going to allow business as usual,"" said Mark Muro, policy director for the Brookings Institution's Metropolitan Policy Program and one of the report's authors. But he said the end of programs in current law was in sight, ""and it's going to be broader and deeper than people imagine. It's time to start thinking about this very seriously."" The report, ""Beyond Boom and Bust,"" urges Washington to rethink rather than eliminate its support for projects that produce power with little or none of the carbon emissions most scientists blame for an increase in global temperatures. It was produced by Brookings, the Washington-based World Resources Institute and the Breakthrough Institute, a California-based center that focuses on energy and the environment. About two-thirds of the $24 billion Washington spent on energy subsidies in 2011 went to support energy efficiency and renewable sources such as wind, solar and biofuels. In addition, private investors poured another $48 billion into renewable energy last year, a report from the Pew Charitable Trusts found last week. That boosted the United States back to the No. 1 slot worldwide after two years trailing China, Pew found -- a move aided by many of the subsidy programs that are scheduled to expire. The research and investments have led to sharply higher electric generating capacity and reduced cost to a point where renewable energy is nearly competitive with natural gas, said Jesse Jenkins, director of energy and climate policy at the Breakthrough Institute. In some places, wind power is as cheap as electricity from gas, largely because of a federal tax credit, Jenkins said. But much of that success is because of subsidies aimed at helping those technologies win a foothold in the market, which is still dominated by coal. ""We need to make sure we're not walking away and pulling the plug on that sector right now,"" Jenkins told CNN. The report calls for a tripling of energy research and development funding and replacing current federal loan guarantees with programs aimed at helping private companies get low-carbon technologies to market faster. In addition, the current interest among military planners in projects such as solar power -- spurred partly by the wish to reduce the risks involved in shipping fuel to troops in the field -- could lead to commercial applications, the researchers state. The study didn't calculate a price tag for those plans. Jenkins said the money needed might not be as much as the peak of spending under the stimulus bill and earlier programs, which was as high as $44 billion in 2009 -- ""but I think it needs to be quite a bit higher than the downward slope we see going forward."" Among the Republicans who control the House of Representatives, however, there appears to be little support for keeping clean energy programs alive. In particular, the 2011 failure of the solar-panel manufacturer Solyndra became a lightning rod for critics of the Obama administration. Supporters say Solyndra was undermined by the explosive growth of the solar industry in China, but the GOP has attacked the loan-guarantee program as a boondoggle that rewards politically favored industries. ""What's going on in the Department of Energy is unbelievable,"" Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, the chairman of a House subcommittee that oversees stimulus spending, told reporters Tuesday. ""This loan guarantee program -- 27 companies got your tax dollars. Twenty-three of those companies had ratings of double-B-minus from Fitch and Standard and Poor's, which is another way of saying they were junk rated. No private money would go there."" Solyndra's failure ""certainly crystallized a lot of concerns,"" Muro said. ""It exacerbated a kind of backlash that has made all of this more difficult, and it has complicated the ability to have clear pragmatic discussions about how to support these industries and continue driving them towards subsidy independence."" Solyndra received more than $500 million in loan guarantees from the Department of Energy before filing for bankruptcy, putting 1,000-plus workers out of their jobs. Another Energy Department-funded company, Arizona-based First Solar, announced Tuesday that it would lay off 2,000 people -- most of them in Europe, where the solar market has weakened in recent months, the company said. Jenkins said the current boom in natural gas is being driven by drilling techniques that were largely the result of federally funded research and technology since the 1970s. However, that ""sort of moved the bar on wind and solar,"" sharply dropping natural gas prices just as those technologies were becoming more competitive.","U.S. clean energy subsidies will be ""largely dismantled"" by 2014, report finds .

"Casey Kasem's children are being prevented from visiting their ailing father, his daughter Kerri told CNN. Casey Kasem, known for his years hosting the countdown shows ""American Top 40"" and ""Casey's Top 40,"" is suffering from Parkinson's disease. He's 81 and retired from his radio hosting in 2009. According to Kerri Kasem, about three months ago, her stepmother, Jean Kasem, suddenly barred her sister, her uncle and some of Kasem's friends from seeing him. She's perplexed by the decision. ""I don't get it, I don't understand it,"" Kerri Kasem, who co-hosts the radio show ""Sixx Sense"" with Motley Crue's Nikki Sixx, told CNN. ""He has Parkinson's and all the research we've done indicates socialization would help him."" CNN has reached out in an attempt to get a statement from Jean Kasem, but has so far been unsuccessful. Los Angeles TV station KABC reported that Kerri Kasem and other members of the family held a protest at Kasem's Holmby Hills house on Tuesday. ""He can't really speak, but he knows we're there,"" she told the station. ""And last time we saw him, he could shuffle a little bit. He had a hard, very hard, time walking. He was just deteriorating due to Parkinson's disease."" ""We fear that he's been isolated and neglected, and so that's why we stand here today,"" said Gonzalo Venecia, Casey's former personal assistant. Asked about accusations that her family was trying to become beneficiaries of Kasem's will, Kerri Kasem told CNN that wasn't the case. ""My dad told us a long time ago we were not in the will, and we're OK with that. We've known that for years,"" she said. ""I've never asked him for anything, nor have I asked Jean for anything."" Don Pitts, Kasem's agent of more than 35 years, said he did not want to take sides in the argument, but he did say Casey is still of sound mind at age 81. ""He has Parkinson's, has it very bad.  It took his speech, and for somebody who made millions of dollars using his voice -- for him to lose that gift, that beautiful instrument -- it must be frustrating.  But he's handling it very well,"" Pitts said. ""His mind is very sharp, his brain works well. You can tell in his eyes he understands everything you're saying.  He just has trouble translating it from the brain to his vocal cords.""

"Roger Federer handed his fellow Swiss Stan Wawrinka a tough three-set loss in the semifinals of the World Tour Finals on Saturday. But it turns out the nearly three-hour epic also took something out of the 33-year-old. Federer pulled out of the final against Novak Djokovic on Sunday, marking just the third time in his career he gave his opponent a walkover. Federer went on court in a track suit to tell the crowd he wasn't match fit and later on Facebook revealed he hurt his back ""late in the match yesterday."" He disclosed in a subsequent interview with the ATP it happened in the third-set tiebreaker of his late-night 4-6 7-5 7-6 (6) victory over Wawrinka. ""I felt all of a sudden the back was feeling funny,"" Federer told the ATP. ""I tried to have treatment on it, medication on it, just tried to turn around as quick as possible really, but didn't really feel that much of an improvement overnight."" Federer was plagued by back issues in 2013, largely contributing to a subpar -- for him -- campaign. He had been in good health in 2014, though, one of the reasons the 17-time grand slam champion was able to climb the rankings and finish at No. 2. ""I tried all year to be ready for the ATP World Tour Finals, and I didn't want it to end this way,"" Federer stated to the crowd. ""It would be too risky at my age to do this right now and I hope you understand. ""I wanted to come out personally and excuse myself. It's been a great week for me. I played some great tennis and I love coming to the O2 and to London, and there's been so many great memories for me here."" Djokovic thus becomes the first men's player since Ivan Lendl in 1987 to claim three consecutive year-end titles and his 31-match winning streak indoors remains intact. He learned of Federer's withdrawal during the doubles final, which was scheduled 2 1/2 hours before the singles final. ""It's a very awkward situation to talk about,"" Djokovic told reporters. ""You never like to win, especially these big matches against big rivals, with a (walkover)."" World No. 1 Djokovic stuck around to play an exhibition set against Andy Murray and that was followed by a doubles tussle featuring Murray and John McEnroe against Tim Henman and Pat Cash. As big a blow as it was for Federer not to play, questions will now center around his fitness for the Davis Cup final against France in Lille that starts on Friday. Indeed the Swiss team might be out of sorts come the final, since the Federer-Wawrinka encounter Saturday -- when Federer saved four match points -- became ill-tempered at times. Wawrinka crunched a backhand at Federer when the latter was at the net and also, at one stage, Wawrinka jawed at the Federer camp, seemingly unhappy with something that was said to him. The Davis Cup is one of the lone huge titles Federer has not won. ""Recovery obviously as quick as possible, and then traveling to France at some point and getting ready on the clay for the Davis Cup final,"" Federer said of his immediate plans. Sunday's dramatic events brought an end to a tournament plagued by lopsided results in singles. Only four of the 14 singles matches extended to three sets. ""But this is something you cannot predict,"" said Djokovic, who handed out chocolates to journalists just as he did after winning last year's event. The doubles competition featured plenty of excitement, including in the final when Americans Bob and Mike Bryan beat Croatia's Ivan Dodig and Brazil's Marcelo Melo 6-7 (5) 6-2 10-7.","Novak Djokovic wins a third straight World Tour Finals after Roger Federer withdraws .

"(CNN) -- They spoke of loss, of heartbreak and of their search for justice. Six mothers gathered at a church in Washington to share their pain: the pain of losing their sons to a police officer's bullets. There was Valerie Bell, whose son Sean was fatally shot, hit by bullets dozens of times. ""November 25, 2006, 50 shots were shot at his car for no reason,"" she said. ""They didn't take my son to be a human being. I've never heard of a person shooting a dog or an animal 50 times."" There was Collette Flanagan, who buried her son Clinton Allen. ""My only son, Clinton Allen, was shot and killed by a Dallas police officer on March 10, 2013. Clinton was only 25 years old, and he was shot seven times, once in the back, and he was unarmed."" There was Mary Ann Hopkins, who struggled to speak about her son Gary, a sophomore in college. ""A police officer who had been in trouble many times before pulled him off the ledge of the car,"" she said. ""Another officer comes around and says he saw an altercation to grab for the officer's gun and shot him in the chest."" Theirs is the pain that's now fueling the protests raging across the nation -- some peaceful, some not quite so. Bigger than Ferguson . Organizers are calling this a ""Week of Outrage."" But as demonstrations pop up around the country, one thing is clear: . This is bigger than Ferguson, Missouri, and New York. The protests over police brutality that the recent deaths of unarmed black men may have started in those cities, but the experience is hardly limited to those communities. ""We share an unspeakable pain and special bond at the arms of losing a loved one at the hands of reckless, callous and malicious police officers,"" Dorothy Copp Elliott said at the First Trinity Lutheran Church gathering on Tuesday. ""Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown and Eric Garner's deaths have caused men and women of conscience and all colors to stand up and say, 'Enough is enough.' "" Medical students: It's a 'public health crisis' Protesters across the country Wednesday flooded Twitter with photos of demonstrations, using the hashtag #whitecoats4blacklives. Physicians for a National Health Program said the protests showed medical students taking a stand to show ""racial violence as a public health crisis."" ""Racial bias and violence are not exclusively a problem of the criminal justice system. As we have seen in Ferguson, Mo., New York, and countless other places, bias kills, sickens, and provides inadequate care,"" the organization said in a statement. In Nashville, a group of demonstrators wearing white coats shut down a busy street near the Tennessee state capitol for more than 30 minutes, CNN affiliate WKRN reported. Harvard Medical School's Twitter account posted photos of students and faculty lying in an atrium at the school during a ""die-in"" protest. At the University of California, San Francisco, school officials praised students for protesting. ""We want to commend our student leaders who have organized and engaged in peaceful demonstrations that acknowledge the relation of racism and violence to health, as awareness is the first step towards change,"" Dr. J. Renee Navarro, vice chancellor of diversity and outreach, said in a statement posted on the school's website. Another shooting . And new instances of officer-involved shooting seem to be adding fuel to the fire. In downtown Phoenix on Tuesday night, dozens of protesters shut down traffic and light rail tracks for about an hour, angry over last week's shooting death of an unarmed drug suspect during a scuffle with a police officer. ""Give everybody the same rights; treat everybody the same,"" Deja Curry told CNN affiliate KTVK. ""They know it's bigger than race."" Eric Garner Jr., the son of the man who died after a New York police officer held him in a chokehold, said he was proud of how protesters are carrying on. ""It made me feel proud because I don't have to share this moment by myself and my family,"" the son told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" ""It's amazing how everybody (is) doing this. My father and I appreciate it."" Protesters 'die in' At New York's Grand Central Terminal on Tuesday night, protesters re-enacted the chokehold that killed the elder Garner and then laid on the ground and chanted. Dariel Ali, who's participated in New York protests for days, held a sign that said, ""My only crime is being black."" ""There's a lot of racial profiling going on within the system,"" he said as protesters chanted behind him. It's been encouraging to see the ranks of protesters grow in recent days, he said. What's next? ""We gain numbers,"" Ali said, ""and we take the streets, like we always do."" California march . For the third night in a row, protesters took to the streets in Berkeley, shutting down BART transit stations and snarling traffic. ""Indict, convict, send those killer cops to jail,"" some chanted, according to affiliate KTVU. The Berkeley City Council canceled Tuesday night's meeting ahead of the latest round of demonstrations. ""We received credible threats,"" Berkeley Police Chief Michael Meehan told KTVU. A night earlier, the California Highway Patrol arrested 150 people for illegally blocking Interstate 80. But unlike Sunday night, when some protesters looted businesses and damaged several police cars in the Oakland and Berkeley areas, there were no reports of major destruction in Northern California on Monday or Tuesday night. Players join in . Basketball players have been a growing voice in the protests, not on the streets but on the courts. A number of NBA stars have sported ""I can't breathe"" T-shirts during warm-ups. Garner's last words have become a rallying cry for protesters after last week's grand jury decision not to indict an officer in his death. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said Tuesday that he supports players who want to voice their opinions. ""I have a tremendous respect for our players and the fact that they want to speak out on an issue, and we support them doing that,"" he said. ""Of course, there are the four corners of the court, and in terms of the game itself it is my job to enforce our rules. Having said that, I recognize that there needs to be some flexibility, and I think, to me, that was a spontaneous reaction from our players ... and my sense is that, to respect it."" NBA Hall of Famer Magic Johnson senses that the Brown and Garner cases have brought about a change. ""I think that what all the people are saying -- not just African-Americans but everybody -- that we have to do something,"" Johnson said. ""There's a disconnect and a trust issue when it comes to African-Americans and police right now, so we've got to somehow bring everybody together and then do something about it."" What's next . At the gathering in D.C., Wanda Johnson spoke of her son Oscar Grant -- and what needs to be done next. ""The officer got up and pulled his gun and shot my son in the back. My son looked up at the officer and said to him, 'You shot me. I have a 4-year-old daughter. You shot me.' And my son was pronounced dead the next morning."" Lives are being lost, she said. ""And the only way that's going to change is if you and I go up to Congress and say, 'We're not going to take it anymore. We are going to stand for what is right, and lives matter, whether the life is black, whether the life is brown, whether the life is right. ""Lives matter,"" she added. Hundreds across the nation plan to march on Wednesday, echoing those words. CNN's Betsy Klein, Lawrence Crook III, Kristina Sgueglia and Catherine E.

"JENA, Louisiana (CNN) -- Mychal Bell, the sole defendant who remains behind bars from the group of teens known as the ""Jena 6,"" will not be released Friday, a court decided. Mychal Bell, 17, is accused with five others of beating Justin Barker in a school fight. Bell, 17, has been in jail since his arrest more than nine months ago. It was not immediately clear what happened in court Friday, where Bell's attorneys had planned to push for his release. ""It is our understanding that the judge refused to give bond or bail to Mychal Bell today,"" the Rev. Al Sharpton, a civil rights activist who traveled to Jena for Thursday's rally, said in a written statement. A source inside the court said the issue of bond was not discussed at the hearing. Attorneys did not immediately comment. The proceedings, involving a juvenile, are not open to media. Bell's mother left the courthouse in tears. ""We'll be back,"" shouted one Jena 6 supporter outside the courthouse Friday. With thousands of demonstrators converging on the small town Thursday to decry what they call ""unequal justice,"" the state's 3rd Circuit Court of Appeal ordered a bond hearing for Bell within 72 hours. It was set for Friday morning.  See highlights from the march » . Also on Friday, the FBI said it was looking into an online posting by a neo-Nazi white supremacist group that published the home addresses of all six of the African-American teenagers, as well as the phone numbers of some. The group said on its Web site it is calling on followers to ""let them know justice is coming."" Bell is the only one of the six teenagers to stand trial so far. District Attorney Reed Walters tried him as an adult and won convictions on two charges. Walters has said he believes Bell was the instigator of the alleged beating of classmate Justin Barker. Last week, the appellate court vacated Bell's battery conviction, saying he should never have been tried as an adult. He was 16 at the time; 17 is the legal adult age in Louisiana. A district judge earlier this month tossed out Bell's conviction for conspiracy to commit second-degree battery. On Tuesday, a three-judge panel said it was ""premature"" to consider releasing Bell. The district attorney will determine whether to refile the charges in juvenile court, a defense attorney said. Bails for the Jena 6 had been set at between $70,000 and $138,000, and all but Bell posted bond. The judge has refused to lower his $90,000 bail, citing the teen's record, which includes four juvenile offenses -- two simple battery charges among them. Bell and five other defendants were arrested in the alleged beating of Barker, who is white, at their high school on December 4. The incident followed months of racial tension, sparked originally when three white teens hung nooses from an oak tree the day after a group of black students violated an unofficial rule among students that only whites sit in that area.  See timeline of how events unfolded » . Prosecutors originally charged all six black students with second-degree attempted murder and conspiracy. Walters reduced charges against at least four of them -- Bell, Robert Bailey Jr., Carwin Jones and Theo Shaw -- to battery and conspiracy. Bryant Purvis awaits arraignment. Charges against Jesse Ray Beard, 14 at the time of the alleged crime, are unavailable because he's a juvenile. Civil rights leaders and other demonstrators call events in Jena a sign of unequal justice in the 21st century. The white kids who hung the nooses were briefly suspended from classes but faced no punishments from the legal system. Donald Washington, U.S. attorney for the Western District of Louisiana, told CNN that the FBI and other investigators thought the noose incident bore the markings of a hate crime, but a decision was made not to press charges because the case didn't meet federal criteria. The students were under 18 and had no prior records, and no group such as the Ku Klux Klan was found to be behind their actions. Authorities estimated about 15,000 to 20,000 protesters came out Thursday to Jena -- a town of about 3,000, according to the 2000 census.

"Sounds of arguing for an hour before the shooting. Blood stains on a cell phone and cricket bat. Boxes of testosterone and needles. The shape of prosecutors' case against Oscar Pistorius began to come into focus Wednesday as they argued the Olympian charged with killing his girlfriend, model Reeva Steenkamp, should be denied bail because he might disappear if released from jail. But the Olympic sprinter's defense team battled back, questioning the quality of the police investigation. The bail hearing ended Wednesday with no decision. Final arguments are scheduled for Thursday morning. And all Steenkamp's family wants is the truth, her half-brother Adam told CNN's Jake Tapper on Wednesday. Pistorius is charged with premeditated murder in the death of Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day. He has said he thought he was shooting at an intruder. But police investigator Hilton Botha told the court Wednesday that Pistorius, 26, wasn't acting in self-defense when he shot through the door of a toilet room in the bathroom of his home and killed Steenkamp. Botha said he believes Pistorius knew Steenkamp was on the other side of the door. He didn't explain why investigators think that but suggested Pistorius was specifically aiming to hit the toilet where Steenkamp had gone. But he also said investigators have found no evidence that is inconsistent with Pistorius' story. Pistorius' affidavit in alleged murder of girlfriend . Bail hearing . Prosecutors spent much of the hearing Wednesday focused on the bathroom of Pistorius' Pretoria home, where authorities say the track star shot Steenkamp three times, in the hip, elbow and ear. Bullet trajectories show that Pistorius had to turn left and fire at an angle to aim at the toilet, Botha testified. Had he fired head-on into the door, he would have missed her, Botha said. Defense attorney Barry Roux disputed that, saying the evidence does not show there was an effort to aim at the toilet. Prosecutors are trying to prove Pistorius intentionally fired on Steenkamp, 29, in a premeditated attempt to kill her. Pistorius and his lawyers argue he mistook her for an intruder and killed her accidentally. Pistorius said in a statement read Tuesday by his lawyer that he believes Steenkamp slipped into the bathroom when he got up to close the balcony door in his bedroom in the early hours of February 14. Hearing noises and gripped with fear that someone had broken into his home, Pistorius said he grabbed his gun, yelled for the intruder to leave and shot through the toilet-room door before realizing the person inside might have been Steenkamp. Roux said Wednesday that the defense team believes Steenkamp locked the door when she heard Pistorius yelling for the intruder to leave. He also said Steenkamp's bladder was empty, suggesting she had gone to the bathroom as Pistorius claimed. Botha also said police believe a blood-stained cricket bat found in the bathroom was used to break down the locked door to the toilet. Pistorius said in his statement that he used the bat to break down the door in an effort to get to Steenkamp to help her. Botha agreed with the defense contention that, other than the bullet wounds, her body showed no sign of an assault or efforts to defend herself. But prosecutors and Pistorius' defense battled over allegations that testosterone and needles were found at the home, as well as the quality of the police investigation. Opinion: What my son taught me about Oscar Pistorius . Investigative errors? Amid speculation by outsiders to the case that steroids or other drugs could have somehow played a role in the shooting, Botha testified that investigators found two boxes of testosterone and needles at Pistorius' home. Under questioning by Roux, however, Botha said he hadn't read the full name of the substance -- which Roux said was an herbal remedy called testoconpasupium coenzyme -- when investigators took the materials into evidence.  A quick Internet search on  the name of the substance yielded no results. He also said the defense forensics team found a bullet in the toilet that police had missed and noted police had failed to find out who owned ammunition found at the home or photograph it. Investigators also went into Pistorius' home without wearing protective foot covers to prevent contamination of the crime scene, Roux said. Botha conceded that was true and said it was because police didn't have any more of the covers left. Roux questioned police arguments that a witness heard sounds of an argument before the shooting. The witness, Roux said, lives 600 meters (more than a third of a mile) from Pistorius' home. Prosecutor Gerrie Nel countered that the witness lives 300 meters away. Would he run? Botha told Magistrate Desmond Nair that investigators believe Pistorius is violent and might flee if released from jail. He described two encounters with Pistorius, one in which Botha said the track star asked someone else to take the blame when a gun went off at a Johannesburg restaurant. Police said the second incident took place at a racetrack, where Pistorius allegedly threatened to assault someone. Authorities have also said they have responded to previous domestic incidents at Pistorius' home, but have not elaborated. In his statement Tuesday, Pistorius said he and Steenkamp were deeply in love and said he was ""mortified"" over her death. High hurdle . Defense attorneys are trying to overcome South African law, which makes it difficult for defendants accused of premeditated murder to get out on bail. The law requires evidence of ""exceptional circumstances"" to justify release. Nair upgraded the charge against Pistorius to premeditated murder Tuesday, saying he could not rule out the possibility that the track star planned Steenkamp's death. But Nair said he would consider downgrading the charge later. In a statement read by his lawyer Tuesday, Pistorius said he would not try to flee or influence any witnesses if he is allowed out on bail, and he said his release wouldn't be a danger to public order. Case rivets fans and friends alike . The case of the global sports hero known as the ""Blade Runner"" has riveted stunned fans around the world. Social media reaction to the case appeared to come down against the sports star but was still noticeably mixed on CNN's Facebook page. ""There's no amount of tears that will save you,"" said Anthonia Nneka Nwabueze. ""Pistorius must face the law for brutally killing an innocent girl -- Reeva."" ""My favorite athlete but what he did is grave and must be punished,"" Carlos Alvarez Ochoa said. But another person who posted called for patience. ""(N)one of us were in the house when his girlfriend was murdered, let's hold off on casting stones at Oscar Pistorius,"" said Adrian van Liere Since. ""Just like anyone else, he deserves a just trial, and in my eyes remains innocent until proven guilty."" Coming to his defense were two acquaintances. ""I've never seen him show an angry side. I've never seen him lose his temper,"" Vanessa Haywood, a model and longtime friend, told CNN. ""He's an incredibly kind and gentle human being."" Another endorsement came from a former girlfriend. ""I would just like to say, I have dated Oscar on off for 5 YEARS,"" Jenna Edkins said on Twitter. ""NOT ONCE has he EVER lifted a finger to me, made me fear for my life."" In an interview for Wednesday's ""Anderson Cooper 360,"" Adam Steenkamp told Jake Tapper ""there was no indication that anything was bad. I mean, we know Reeva. We knew Reeva. She was happy. And if Reeva was happy, everything was OK... and everything was good, then everything was normal."" Steenkamp said he never spoke to his half-sister about Pistorius, and she didn't discuss the relationship much -- if at all -- with anyone in the family. So, without any in-depth knowledge, his family keeps vacillating about what the evidence suggests happened, he said. ""At a time like this, when people are grieving, I think it's hard to keep a clear mind on anything,"" Steenkamp said. ""And with the added pressure and the media coverage and the interest, you know, from the world looking into this story, it's a rather unnatural situation. So, I suppose I would agree with everyone is flipping from one side to the other. We just don't know. You know, all that we want is we want to know what the truth is, and I think that's what everyone else would like as well. You know, to be able to make something of this -- to be able to deal with this and have something positive come out of this."" Steenkamp said the worst is over. ""We are all holding up very well considering the circumstances. We've now had just about a week to let things sink in. And we've had a very busy few days as well,"" he said. ""I feel like we have done the most difficult thing for us as a family, so far, in viewing my sister's body, and then attending her memorial yesterday. We're doing OK.""","Steenkamp's half-brother Adam says all the family wants is the truth .

"Federal investigators are checking whether 55 colleges and universities illegally handled sexual violence and harassment complaints, the U.S. Department of Education said Thursday. Such investigations have long been known, but this is the first time that the department has released a list of all probes currently under way. The list includes colleges and universities in 27 states and in the District of Columbia. See the full list here . ""We are making this list available in an effort to bring more transparency to our enforcement work and to foster better public awareness of civil rights,"" said Catherine E. Lhamon, the department's assistant secretary for civil rights. ""We hope this increased transparency will spur community dialogue about this important issue. I also want to make it clear that a college or university's appearance on this list and being the subject of a Title IX investigation in no way indicates at this stage that the college or university is violating or has violated the law."" Five schools promptly responded to CNN's request for response. The University of California, Berkeley said it will cooperate with the investigation and added that its chancellor had sent out a letter to campus saying sexual assault would not be tolerated. ""Much has been done to strengthen the campus' handling of these issues, but we understand that there is always room for improvement,"" the university statement said. Washington State University, meanwhile, said it was notified in January 2013 that a federal complaint had been filed and volunteered to work with the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights to improve its policies. In February, the university said, federal representatives visited Pullman and engaged in student focus groups as well as student and employee interviews. ""There has been no finding of any wrongdoing on the part of WSU. We are still waiting to hear from OCR regarding participation in the voluntary resolution process,"" a university statement said, adding that there's no tolerance for sexual harassment, assault or misconduct on its campus. The University of Wisconsin-Whitewater said it could not comment on specifics because of the ongoing investigation but said it, too, took sexual violence seriously and provides all victims with resources and assistance. The University of Chicago said it had ""made every effort to comply with the spirit and letter of this inquiry"" and is committed to ensuring that its programs and work environment are discrimination free. The University of Colorado Boulder said it wasn't surprised by its inclusion as it knew of the probe in July, and it has since hired a law firm to conduct an external review of its policies. It also expects to a name a specially designated Title IX director by the end of the summer. See other responses here . The investigations center on Title IX, under which a school must ensure that students are not denied or limited in the ability to participate in or benefit from its educational programs or activities on the basis of sex. The list, which reflects open investigations as of Thursday, does not disclose any details about the cases, other than when the investigation was opened. The list will be updated regularly and available to the public upon request. In February, CNN profiled student and faculty activists from six schools in a report on how sexual violence complaints to the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights had almost tripled since 2009. Thursday's numbers come on the heels of a marked year-to-year increase in complaints the department received, from 17 in 2012 to 30 in 2013. Five of those six students' universities were included in Thursday's report: the University of Texas-Pan American; Vanderbilt University; the University of California, Berkeley; Occidental College; and Emory University. In the story, Joanna Espinosa, a student at UTPA who has since graduated, told CNN she would not have come forward without the help of a nationwide network that has been a driving force in bringing attention to the way schools handle sexual misconduct reports. President Barack Obama recently called the nationwide, student-led movement a catalyst for a federal task force to protect college students from sexual violence on campus. Rape is a longstanding issue on college campuses, but the latest movement, led by student activists, survivors and faculty, recasts sexual violence as a cultural problem on campuses nationwide -- not just a series of isolated incidents. Students are taking matters into their own hands, filing complaints en masse and speaking out publicly. They've flocked to advocacy groups such as End Rape on Campus and Know Your IX, which sprang from grassroots activism around university handling -- or mishandling -- of sexual violence. Leslie Gomez, a Pennsylvania attorney and former prosecutor who has worked as a sexual assault policy consultant for Occidental College, Grinnell College and other schools, told CNN that from one campus to the next, the concerns are mostly the same: lack of clarity, students being mistreated, complex procedures and insufficient training among those leading the processes. After she grew displeased with how campus and local authorities handled her case, Espinosa reached out to End Rape on Campus, and a member of the group helped her file a complaint with the federal Office of Civil Rights. ""I'm not sure I would've come forward if all these people hadn't done it before me,"" Espinosa said. ""I needed the validation. I needed someone to confirm, 'You're right. You're not blowing things out of proportion.' ...  It was a relief to hear someone tell me, 'You have a case, and they shouldn't treat you this way.' "" In Thursday's announcement, the Department of Education said releasing its list ""advances a key goal of President Obama's White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault to bring more transparency to the federal government's enforcement activities around this issue."" The department also released new guidance this week outlining federally funded schools' responsibilities to address sexual violence and other forms of discrimination. All schools -- from K-12 to universities -- must comply with Title IX or risk losing funding and Justice Department action. ""Under federal law, sexual violence refers to physical sexual acts perpetrated against a person's will or where a person is incapable of giving consent -- including rape, sexual assault, sexual battery, sexual abuse and sexual coercion,"" the statement said.","List includes colleges and universities from 27 states and Washington, D.C.

"(CNN) -- An autopsy on comedian Joan Rivers has been completed, but more studies will be needed to determine the cause and manner of her death, New York City medical examiner's office spokeswoman Julie Bolcer said Friday. Rivers, 81, died in a New York hospital Thursday afternoon, a week after suffering cardiac arrest during a medical procedure, her daughter said. Rivers had been on life support at Manhattan's Mount Sinai hospital, where she was taken after she stopped breathing at the Yorkville Endoscopy clinic on August 28. Joan Rivers: A pointed, pioneering comedian . Rivers was undergoing an apparently minor elective procedure at the clinic when she suffered cardiac and respiratory arrest, according to the New York Fire Department. Paramedics took her by ambulance to Mount Sinai Hospital, about a mile from the clinic, where she was initially listed in critical condition. The outpatient clinic is now being investigated by the New York State Department of Health, spokesman James O'Hara said. Joan Rivers: In her own words . No criminal investigations are currently under way in Rivers' death, according to several New York law enforcement officials. The state health department is investigating whether there was any malpractice by the doctors and their staff, the same officials said. The Rivers family made very little information about her medical condition public, finally confirming Tuesday that she was on life support. ""My son and I would like to thank the doctors, nurses, and staff of Mount Sinai Hospital for the amazing care they provided for my mother,"" her daughter said. ""Cooper and I have found ourselves humbled by the outpouring of love, support, and prayers we have received from around the world. They have been heard and appreciated.' Melissa Rivers and her son Cooper have spent the past week by Rivers' hospital bedside, rushing there last Thursday when they learned of her illness. ""My mother's greatest joy in life was to make people laugh,"" Melissa Rivers said. ""Although that is difficult to do right now, I know her final wish would be that we return to laughing soon."" Share your memories . The clinic has not responded to repeated calls from CNN about the state's investigation. Yorkville Endoscopy's website says it is an ""ambulatory surgical center"" that has been ""approved by the Department of Health."" The description of its accreditations is blank. ""Yorkville Endoscopy is a state of the art facility, staffed by highly experienced endoscopists whose mission is to provide safe and compassionate care to patients and their families,"" the website says. Tributes from Joan's friends . The funeral for Rivers will be at Temple Emanu-El in Manhattan on Sunday, according to temple spokeswoman Elizabeth Fezrine. Details, including the time and if the public will be allowed to attend, are not yet known, she said. Tributes to Rivers and her long career included one from former first lady Nancy Reagan, whose close circle of friends included Rivers. ""Joan Rivers was not only a dear friend, but one of the kindest and funniest people I ever knew,"" Reagan said. ""I doubt there's anyone who hasn't laughed at her or with her until they cried. Today our tears are those of sadness. I know I join millions in saying, 'Thanks for the good times Joan, we will truly miss you.' My love and deepest sympathy go to Melissa and Cooper.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Phillip and Nancy Garrido pleaded guilty Thursday to the kidnapping and sexual assault of Jaycee Dugard, whom they held captive from age 11 through 29, the El Dorado County, California, district attorney said. Both Garridos will receive life in prison at a sentencing hearing scheduled for June 2, District Attorney Vern Pierson said in a statement. Through a representative, Dugard, now 30, expressed relief that her abductors ""confessed."" ""I'm relieved that Phillip and Nancy Garrido have finally acknowledged their guilt and confessed to their crimes against me and my family,"" Dugard said in a statement released by her representatives at Nancy Seltzer & Associates, Inc., in Los Angeles. The married couple abducted Dugard when she was 11, and they held her in a hidden compound on their home's grounds in Antioch, California. Dugard was snatched from the street in front of her home in South Lake Tahoe, California, in 1991. Authorities found her in 2009. Phillip Garrido, a registered sex offender on parole at the time of his arrest, is accused of fathering two daughters with Dugard during her captivity. ""The enormity of the defendants' actions has caused tremendous pain and suffering to Jaycee, her mother, Terry Probyn, and their family,"" Pierson said in a statement. ""With a guilty plea by both defendants, Terry, Jaycee and her children can now be spared the grief and trauma of having to be dragged into the court process to testify at a jury trial,"" Pierson said. ""Additionally, were it not for Jaycee's strong cooperation with our office and the prosecution of the Garridos, we would not have been able to firmly stand by our position to take this case to jury trial.  Jaycee's courage and willingness to confront her abductors in court directly led to the Defendants' plea and life sentences,"" Pierson added in his statement. California law doesn't provide for a death penalty or a life sentence without possibility of parole for the offenses committed by the Garridos, Pierson said. Phillip Garrido, 60, pleaded guilty to one count of kidnapping and 13 counts of sexual assault, Pierson said. He faces a maximum possible sentence of 431 years to life in prison and he has waived his right to appeal, Pierson said. Nancy Garrido, 55, pleaded guilty to one count of kidnapping, one count of rape by force, and to California's ""one strike"" rape law, Pierson said. She will be sentenced to the negotiated disposition of life in prison, Pierson said. She will receive a 25-years-to-life sentence under the ""one strike"" rape law, plus 11 years, which is the maximum possible sentence for the kidnapping charges based upon the sentencing laws in 1991, Pierson said. Nancy Garrido also has waived her right to appeal, prosecutors said. Her plea was offered contingent upon Phillip Garrido pleading guilty and waiving his right to appeal, prosecutors said.","Phillip and Nancy Garrido pleaded guilty to kidnapping and sexual assault .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Attorney General Eric Holder has asked federal prosecutor John Durham to examine whether CIA interrogations of suspected terrorists were illegal, the Justice Department announced Monday. President Obama wants the FBI to question terror suspects from now on, sources say. The move came as senior administration officials said President Obama had OK'd a special interrogation unit to be housed within the FBI, and as a redacted CIA inspector general's report on interrogation methods was made public for the first time. Durham has been investigating the destruction of CIA interrogation tapes since January 2008. He was initially appointed to do so by then-Attorney General Michael Mukasey. Holder said he decided to expand Durham's mandate after examining reports from the Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility as well as a classified version of the 2004 CIA inspector general's report into questionable interrogation techniques, among other documents.  Watch what tactics a rights group calls ""illegal"" » . ""As a result of my analysis of all of this material, I have concluded that the information known to me warrants opening a preliminary review into whether federal laws were violated in connection with the interrogation of specific detainees at overseas locations,"" Holder said in a written statement. He said he recognizes his decision to open the investigation ""will be controversial,"" and he reiterated earlier statements that there would be no prosecutions of CIA personnel ""who acted in good faith and within the scope of the legal guidance given by"" Bush administration lawyers. ""This preliminary review will not focus on those individuals,"" he said. He did not specify a focus for Durham's investigation. President Obama issued a statement echoing Holder's comment that Obama would ""look forward and not backward when it comes to issues such as these."" Then-President George W. Bush authorized ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" for terror suspects in the years following the September 11, 2001, terror attacks. Those techniques, which included the practice of waterboarding -- simulated drowning -- drew sharp criticism from opponents, who said they amounted to torture. Liberal groups have pushed for an investigation, stressing that it should include those who ordered the use of the techniques. Prior to his appointment to looking into the interrogation tape destruction, Durham was an assistant U.S. attorney in Connecticut, where among other cases he oversaw the investigations and convictions of a pair of Connecticut mayors. He also oversaw a federal investigation that broke up a corrupt law enforcement situation in Boston, Massachusetts, that was the basis for the Oscar-winning movie ""The Departed."" Durham was tasked with investigating the destruction of tapes of CIA interrogations of terror suspects. The tapes were destroyed in 2005 and never handed over to the courts or the special 9/11 commission. Holder said Durham's investigation has given him ""great familiarity with much of the information that is relevant to the matter at hand."" Earlier Monday, senior administration officials said Obama approved the establishment of a special unit of terrorist interrogators based out of the FBI. The move comes in the wake of criticism of questionable CIA interrogation techniques, such as waterboarding and the transfer of detainees to countries where torture is common. The decision to place the FBI, rather than the CIA, in charge of interrogating suspected terrorists represents a major shift in U.S. national security policy. The change is based on the recommendation of an interrogation task force that Obama established shortly after taking office in January. The interagency High Value Detainee Interrogation Group will be overseen by the National Security Council and ""draw on interrogators from defense, intelligence, and law enforcement,"" a senior administration official said. The group will be tasked in part with ensuring that future interrogations comply with restrictions outlined in the U.S. Army Field Manual. The manual provides ""adequate and effective means"" of conducting investigations, the administration officials asserted, though they left open the possibility of adding new methods based on the latest scientific research regarding what are called ""best practices"" for interrogation. ""There will be full transparency"" regarding ""any new techniques that might be allowed"" as a result of such research, one of the officials promised. The State Department also will play a more prominent role in overseeing transfers of suspected terrorists to other countries for interrogation, the official said. The department will help ensure that suspected terrorists are not abused or tortured. ""The new policies proposed by the Task Force will allow us to draw the best personnel from across the government to conduct interrogations that will yield valuable intelligence and strengthen our national security,"" Holder said in a written statement. ""There is no tension between strengthening our national security and meeting our commitment to the rule of law, and these new policies will accomplish both."" Asked to comment on the transfer of responsibility for interrogations from the CIA to the FBI, two former senior CIA officials said the agency never intended to handle detentions, and that it essentially was forced to do so as a result of its pursuit of suspected terrorists after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Some of the questionable tactics used in that pursuit were highlighted Monday by the release of a 2004 report from the CIA's inspector general. The report outlines the use of multiple unauthorized detainee interrogation methods. Among the findings: U.S. interrogators threatened a captured al Qaeda operative with a power drill to try to scare him into giving up information. Interrogators also threatened to kill another top captive's children in an effort to get the men to talk, the report says. The gun and drill were used in two interrogation sessions against Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, according to a source familiar with the report's contents. Al-Nashiri is accused of plotting the 2000 attack on the USS Cole, which left 17 U.S. sailors dead. The report says interrogators told al-Nashiri that if he didn't talk, ""we could get your mother in here. We can bring your family in here."" Interrogators also reportedly told Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, that ""if anything else happens in the United States, we're going to kill your children."" Unauthorized detainee interrogation methods also included, among other things, ""the making of threats, blowing cigar smoke, employing certain stress positions, the use of a stiff brush on a detainee, and stepping on a detainee's ankle shackles,"" the report says. The report also states that interrogators staged mock executions -- which are banned by the U.N. Convention Against Torture -- to try to frighten detainees into talking. In one instance, a gun was fired in an adjacent room to make a terrorism suspect think another prisoner was being killed. ""When the guards moved the detainee from the interrogation room,"" the report states, ""they passed a guard who was dressed as a hooded detainee, lying motionless on the ground and made to appear as if he had been shot."" A federal judge in New York had ordered a redacted version of the report to be released as part of a lawsuit filed by the ACLU. ""This is in many ways an old story,"" CIA Director Leon Panetta said in a written statement. ""The outlines of prior interrogation practices, and many of the details, are public already. The use of enhanced interrogation techniques, begun when our country was responding to the horrors of September 11, ended in January. For the CIA now, the challenge is not the battles of yesterday, but those of today and tomorrow."" The interrogations took place in the CIA's secret prisons before 2006, when Bush moved all detainees from such facilities to the detention center in the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. A CIA spokesman would not talk about specifics of the inspector general's report but said all the incidents described in it have been reviewed by government prosecutors. ""The CIA in no way endorsed behavior -- no matter how infrequent -- that went beyond formal guidance. This has all been looked at; professionals in the Department of Justice decided if and when to pursue prosecution. That's how the system was supposed to work, and that's how it did work,"" CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano said. One of the sources, a former intelligence official who is familiar with the report, said that while the report ""reaffirmed"" the interrogation program, it ""also showed some had strayed off center."" The official said about a dozen cases of potential misconduct by interrogators were referred to the Justice Department. Of those, only one person was prosecuted, the official said, with the rest being referred to the CIA accountability board, an internal disciplinary body. Two people resigned rather than face the CIA board, the official said. This official said that when CIA leadership found out about the drill incident, they were ""angry as hell."" The official called it ""nickel-and-dime foolishness"" that was not tolerated. The individual who used the drill was pulled from the program and ""sharply reprimanded,"" the official said. Anthony D. Romero, executive director of the ACLU, released a statement Sunday saying, ""Leaked portions of the CIA inspector general's report offer more proof that government officials committed serious crimes while interrogating prisoners. So-called 'enhanced interrogation techniques' like mock executions and threatening prisoners with guns and power drills are not only reprehensible but illegal."" In anticipation of the release of the report Monday, Romero added, ""Releasing the report with minimal redactions is essential to knowing what crimes were committed and who was involved.""

"She's back. Socialist Michelle Bachelet, who was Chile's president from 2006 to 2010, cruised to victory in Sunday's presidential runoff. With more than 93% of votes counted, she won 62.3% of votes, election officials said. Evelyn Matthei of the conservative Independent Democratic Union party garnered 37.7% of votes and conceded the election. ""I shall be a president for everyone in Chile,"" Bachelet said during a congratulatory phone call from President Sebastian Pinera. She will take over from him in March. In her victory speech, Bachelet promised to improve education and work for equality. She thanked her supporters. ""Thanks to the millions of people who, today, have demonstrated with their vote that they believe in me -- just like I believe in you,"" she said. Bachelet was the first female president of Chile and left office with high approval ratings. In 2010, she was tapped to head U.N. Women, a United Nations agency created to promote gender equality around the world. Chilean voters first cast ballots last month, but no candidate secured enough votes then to declare victory. The South American country's constitution requires a presidential candidate to garner more than 50% of votes to win. Presidents are prohibited from seeking immediate re-election.","""I shall be a president for everyone in Chile,"" says Bachelet .

"If something can connect to a network, it can be hacked. Computers and phones are still popular targets, but increasingly so are cars, home security systems, TVs and even oil refineries. That was the message at this year's Black Hat and DefCon computer security conferences, which took place last week in Las Vegas. The annual conferences draw a mix of computer researchers and hackers who present the latest bugs and vulnerabilities they've discovered. It's a combination of public service, business and sport. These are some of the more popular targets covered at this year's conferences. By drawing attention to them, the ""white-hat"" hackers hope to encourage greater security from the various manufacturers and industries, and more vigilance from consumers. Typically, the presenters inform manufacturers of bugs ahead of their talks so the companies can fix the issues before they are exploited by criminals. Remote-controlled cars . Someone hacking your computer can be an inconvenience. Someone hacking your car can be deadly. A pair of presentations on hacking cars kicked off the DefCon conference on Friday. Australian hacker Zoz outlined the security issues fully autonomous cars will face and said car-hacking is inevitable. Autonomous vehicles like cars and drones are essentially robots, and they rely on sensors to operate. He said a hacker could theoretically take complete control of a car over wireless networks or trick its various sensors into feeding a motorist false information about location, speed and the proximity of other cars or objects. Fully driverless cars are still a few years away, but computerized systems are common in vehicles on the road today. Electronic control units can control a range of car functions, including braking, accelerating and steering. They manage security features, in-car displays and even seat belts. Researchers Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek, funded by a grant from the U.S. military's DARPA, looked into what kind of damage hackers could do to a car by taking control of a Toyota Prius and a Ford Escape. To access the systems, they had to physically connect a computer to the cars through a diagnostics port. They wrote custom software that let them hijack the cars' systems. Once in control, they disabled brakes, changed the display to show incorrect speed or gas levels, and messed with the steering and seat belts. They were able to kill the engine and toy with with less consequential features like the car's horn and lights. Toyota played down the wired demonstration and said it is focusing on security measures to prevent wireless attacks. Compromising smartphones . Attacks on personal computers used to be the bread and butter of cybercriminals, spawning a lucrative industry of black-market malware and the anti-virus programs that fight them. The next big target is smartphones. Mobile devices are not impervious to attacks, even though walled-off app stores have kept much of the malware at bay. Kevin McNamee demonstrated how a piece of malware could turn an Android smartphone into a ""spy phone"" that remotely monitors its owner, sending information on the location, communications and content, like photos, back to a third party. The hack isn't new, but McNamee managed to inject the malicious code into popular apps like ""Angry Birds."" Once it was installed, the user would have no idea that their phone was acting as a remote surveillance device. Verizon ""femtocells"" -- small boxes used to extend cell service -- were hacked by security researchers at iSEC Partners to intercept calls and any other data sent over cellular networks like texts, images and browsing history. The wireless carrier issued a fix for all its femtocells, but researchers say other networks could still have the same issue. With $45 in hardware, researchers Billy Lau, Yeongjin Jang and Chengyu Song turned an innocent-looking iPhone charger into a tool for gathering information such as passcodes, e-mails and other communications, and location data directly from the smartphone. Apple thanked the researchers and said it is deploying a fix for the bug in its iOS 7 software update, which comes out this year. The too-smart home . Thanks to cheap, low-power sensors, anything in your house can become a ""smart"" device, helpfully connecting to the Internet so you can control it from a computer or smartphone.  Smart home security devices have the potential to cause the most damage if hacked, and two separate demonstrations showed how to break in by opening ""smart"" front-door locks. Another unsettling trend at the conferences was spying on unwitting people through their own cameras. Home security cameras could be disabled by someone who wanted to break in, or they could be turned into remote surveillance devices. One researcher showed how she easily took over the camera stream on a child's toy from a computer. Researchers Aaron Grattafiori and Josh Yavor found bugs in the 2012 model of the Samsung Smart TV that allowed them to turn on and watch video from the set's camera. Samsung said it had released a software update to fix the issue. (Many security experts suggest placing a piece of tape over any cameras you don't want surreptitiously watching you, just to be safe.) Hackers get personal . Even in the wake of this year's NSA revelations, a homemade surveillance device that sniffs out pieces of data from your various computing devices, even when they're not online, is disturbing. Brendan O'Connor, who runs a security firm and is finishing a law degree, has created such a device, dubbed CreepyDOL (DOL stands for Distributed Object Locator; ""Creepy"" is self-explanatory). The device cost $57 to make and consists of a Raspberry Pi computer, a USB hub, two WiFi connections, an SD card and USB power inside an nondescript black case. Computers and phones act as tracking devices and leak information constantly, according to O'Connor. When plugged in, CreepyDOL detects nearby phones and computers and uses them to track people's location and patterns, figuring out who they are, where they go and what they do online. To demonstrate the device without breaking any laws, O'Connor showed his own information as sniffed out by one of the devices. Using a gaming engine and Open Street Maps, he hovered over his dot on a map. It brought up his name, e-mail address, a photo, the dating website he used, details about his devices and the locations he visited in town. In a worst-case scenario, as imagined by O'Connor, a miscreant could plug in one of the devices under any Starbucks near a capital building to pick up the scent of a state senator and wait for them to do something compromising. ""You find somebody with power and exploit them,"" said O'Connor. The creation is remarkable for how simple it is. It's likely others have similar knowledge and setups that exploit the same security flaws in applications, websites, devices and networks. Industrial facilities . The most frightening targets highlighted at the conference were the opposite of personal. Critical infrastructure such as oil and gas pipelines or water treatment plants are potential targets for hackers. Many industries are controlled with supervisory control and data acquisition, or SCADA, systems. The systems are older, installed at a time when people weren't concerned about cyberattacks, and connect to the Internet over an unsecured network protocol. The reason the systems are online in the first place is so that they're easier to monitor. Some, like oil pipelines, are often in remote locations. Multiple demonstrations at the conferences showed just how simple it is to hack energy systems. Researchers Brian Meixell and Eric Forner staged a mock hack of an oil well using pumps and a liquid container filled with teal liquid. They got into the system, turned the pumps on and off and overflowed the containers by feeding the system false data. If it happened on an actual oil well, the hack could result in an environmental catastrophe, according to the researchers. It's possible to shut down an entire industrial facility from 40 miles away using a radio transmitter, according to researchers Carlos Penagos and Lucas Apa. They demonstrated injecting fake measurements, causing the device that received them to behave differently. For example, someone could trigger a water tank to overflow by faking an abnormally high temperature. The industries and U.S. government are aware that industrial systems are vulnerable, but their remoteness and age make upgrading difficult and expensive. There is no built-in system for releasing software patches, like there is with personal computers.","Security researchers showed the latest phone, home and car hacks in Las Vegas .

"Nintendo on Friday apologized to gamers for leaving same-sex couples out of an upcoming ""life simulation"" game that lets players, flirt, date, marry and have children. The statement came as an online movement asking them to change ""Tomodachi Life"" was picking up steam. ""We apologize for disappointing many people by failing to include same-sex relationships in Tomodachi Life ...,"" the Japanese company said in a news release. ""At Nintendo, dedication has always meant going beyond the games to promote a sense of community, and to share a spirit of fun and joy. We are committed to advancing our longtime company values of fun and entertainment for everyone."" Tye Marini, 23, is a self-described Nintendo fanatic. The Mesa, Arizona, man was excited to learn that ""Tomodachi Life,"" a version of a ""life simulation"" game previously only available in Japan, would be released in North America for the Nintendo 3DS next month. He was less excited, however, when he learned that his in-game avatar -- or ""Mii,"" in Nintendo-speak -- could only be romantically involved with a female character, as opposed to one representing his real-life fiancé. And, thus, was #Miiquality born. Launched last month, Marini's social-media campaign has begun picking up steam on Facebook and Twitter, where like-minded gamers are asking Nintendo to reconsider. ""By excluding same-sex relationships in a game that's focused around relationships like this one, they're really excluding a lot of people,"" Marini told CNN affiliate KTVK. In the game, players create or import their Mii (pronounced ""me""), which then can interact with characters that represent other real-world friends in their network. ""The situation wouldn't be as big of a deal if it weren't for the fact that relationships and marriage are a huge part of the game,"" Marini said in the video he created to announce his campaign. ""The relationships and interactions between the Mii characters in the game, coupled with their relationships to you in real life, are what makes this game so appealing. ... Not being able to date and marry the gender that I'm attracted to in real life really takes all of the immersion and fun out of it for me."" Nintendo said it's too late to change the game, and that allowing same-sex couples would be too big and complicated of an update to release for it. But the company promised to do things differently next time. ""We pledge that if we create a next installment in the Tomodachi series, we will strive to design a game-play experience from the ground up that is more inclusive, and better represents all players,"" the statement read. At a time when barriers to same-sex marriage are falling across the United States, Nintendo's stance could have been a public relations problem for a company already facing slumping revenue amid weak sales for its Wii U console. Marini acknowledged to KTVK that ""there are far greater concerns out there"" than relationship options in a video game. But he noted that popular games like ""The Sims,"" a life-simulation franchise launched by Electronic Arts in 2000, have allowed same-sex relationships for years. Marini has specifically said he's not calling for a boycott of the game, saying it would do more harm than good.","Online protests grows over lack of same-sex relationships in Nintendo game .

"On July 4, 2010, Pope Benedict XVI traveled to Sulmona for his second visit to venerate the relics of his long-ago predecessor, Pope and St. Celestine V, who died in 1296. Few predicted then that just a few years later, Benedict and Celestine would be locked together in history as the two popes who retired, theoretically voluntarily, because of their age. Here is what Celestine wrote: ""We, Celestine, Pope V, moved by legitimate reasons, that is to say for the sake of humility, of a better life and an unspotted conscience, of weakness of body and of want of knowledge, the malignity of the people, and personal infirmity, to recover the tranquility and consolation of our former life, do freely and voluntarily resign the pontificate."" Compare that to Benedict's statement: ""In today's world, subject to so many rapid changes and shaken by questions of deep relevance for the life of faith, in order to govern the bark of Saint Peter and proclaim the Gospel, both strength of mind and body are necessary, strength which in the last few months, has deteriorated in me to the extent that I have had to recognize my incapacity to adequately fulfill the ministry entrusted to me. For this reason, and well aware of the seriousness of this act, with full freedom I declare that I renounce the ministry of Bishop of Rome, Successor of Saint Peter."" When Pope Benedict went to write his letter of resignation, there can be little doubt that he turned to Celestine's example, the ""papal bull"" (official letter) from 1294 that affirmed the right of the pope to resign and the legal canons that followed codifying the practice.  For the Catholic Church, those 13th-century words stand as relevant and legally valid. Celestine was an interesting fellow, and his life, short papacy and long legacy offer some examples for us as we absorb the surprise of Benedict's resignation. Stanley: Why pope will be remembered for generations . Celestine himself had quite the surprise in July of 1294, when a group of religious and lay Catholics ascended to his mountain retreat and informed him that the Sacred College of Cardinals had just unanimously elected him as the new pope. Celestine, born Pietro del Murrone, was a Benedictine ascetic who spent most of his religious life seeking isolation as a hermit in Abruzzo, but he emerged as a consensus candidate when the cardinals could not agree on any of the usual suspects. The choice was a disaster. King Charles of Anjou (and Naples), a powerful ruler of the era, tried to use him as a pawn to gain legitimacy over Sicily. Celestine created new cardinals without due process, gave the same title to multiple people and in general seemed to have trouble saying no.  Elected in July at 79 and crowned in August, he resigned the papacy in December. Ten days later, his chief lawyer and likely author of the new papal bull permitting resignation, Benedetto Gaitani, became Pope Boniface VIII. Boniface eventually imprisoned the now ex-Pope Celestine and kept him under close watch until he died two years later. Celestine's legacy, in some ways, became even more interesting than his life. Boniface spent his early career undoing all of Celestine's acts and trying to restore the papacy to political prominence. But within a few years of Boniface's death in 1303, Pope Clement V, his successor, moved the papacy to Avignon, France, repudiated Boniface and quickly began canonization proceedings for the soon-to-be St. Celestine. What does this have to do with Benedict? Did his two visits to Celestine's tomb and words of admiration for the saint, hermit and pontiff convey a secret message that Benedict was contemplating retirement? Are the parallels even stronger than Celestine and Benedict being the two popes to resign on account of age? Historians regard Celestine's claim of ""personal infirmity"" with considerable skepticism, focusing instead on ""the malignity of the people"" and pressure from his eventual successor as the real reason for his unprecedented resignation. Opinion: Huge challenges await next pope . For Benedict XVI, the line, ""shaken by questions of deep relevance for the life of faith"" stands out to me.  What are these questions of deep relevance? Benedict was speaking of a shaken world (the Latin version makes this clear), but is he perhaps shaken too by his time on the throne of St. Peter? Each reader may well imprint his or her own issues onto the mind of the aging pope. Is he concerned about the ongoing, devastating revelations about pedophilia in the Catholic Church and related coverups? The ""Vatileaks"" scandal and the corruption it alleges? Does he just believe that the Catholic Church will need new leadership to face the challenges ahead? Or are his concerns more personal? Like Celestine, is he seeking ""tranquility"" and a quiet path to his final days? I doubt we'll ever know more than we do right now. Pope Benedict XVI's legacy is likely to be heavily contested in the years to come.  Particularly since his election, Benedict has stood as the symbol on which those discontented with the direction of the church focus on their ire.  Others, concerned about the changes of Vatican II -- the council convened in 1962 that transformed so many Catholic practices -- see in the current pope and his allies an attempt to restore the older, traditional church that they love. Celestine's legacy, likewise, depended very much on the eye of the beholder. Ascetics revered him, seeing him in a true divine pontiff in contrast to the infernal anti-popes that followed. Petrarch, the great Italian poet, took a neutral stance, suggesting that Celestine was just embracing his true gifts of solitary contemplation. Dante, on the other hand, condemned Celestine for his cowardice, writing, ""che fece per viltade il gran rifiuto / Who made through cowardice the great refusal."" (Dante, Inferno, Canto IIi 60). How will our poets, prophets and people come to see Pope Benedict's resignation? To even begin to answer that, we will need to see who emerges from the basilica when the white smoke rises above St. Peter's Square.","David Perry: Pope Celestine V, from 1296, and Pope Benedict XVI both resigned .

"Tucson, Arizona (CNN) -- As discussions swirled about its origins and impact, the U.S. forest service chief deemed a raging wildfire in southern Arizona as ""the number one priority"" for firefighters nationwide. ""The conditions that we're dealing with here are as bad as we can get,"" said Tom Tidwell, head of the U.S. Forest Service, of the combination of high temperatures, low humidity, ample ""fuel"" and strong winds. ""It just can't get any worse."" Gordon Van Vleet, a spokesman for the Joint Information Center, said that no cause has been determined for the so-called Monument fire, which has spread across the Huachuca Mountains and burned 20,956 acres as of Saturday afternoon. He said authorities likely won't state a cause until the blaze is more under control. ""We know where it started and when it started, but (the specific cause) is under investigation,"" Tidwell said hours later from southern Arizona. ""When we do have that information, we will share it."" But in a press conference, Arizona Sen. John McCain blamed illegal immigrants for starting unspecified fires in that area. ""There is substantial evidence that some of these fires have been caused by people who have crossed our border illegally,"" McCain said. ""The answer to that part of the problem is to get a secure border. The Republican senator said that illegal immigrants set such fires either to send signals, keep warm or distract law enforcement agents. But he did not specify which fires allegedly had been started by illegal immigrants, nor identify his sources or provide details of the ""substantial"" evidence he cited. Randy Parraz, a civil rights advocate who ran unsuccessfully against McCain as a Democratic candidate in 2010, called McCain's remarks suggesting illegal immigrants caused the fires ""careless and reckless"" but not entirely surprising given the political climate in Arizona. ""You have to have some sort of factual basis: John McCain should know better,"" said Parraz, a co-founder of Citizens for a Better Arizona, which is working to recall state Sen. Russel Pearce, the primary sponsor of Arizona's controversial anti-illegal immigration law. ""It's easier to fan the flames of intolerance, especially in Arizona."" Parraz said it is particularly distressing that immigrants are being blamed for destructive fires, at a time when many are also being targeted given the state's unemployment, foreclosure and other economic issues. ""People are looking for someone to blame,"" he said, claiming it is too easy and convenient to target what he called one of Arizona's ""most vulnerable populations."" Angelo Falcon, the president of the National Institute for Latino Policy, criticized McCain for what he called ""increasingly blatant"" political opportunism. ""The degree of irresponsible political pandering by Sen. McCain has no limits,"" Falcon said in an email to CNN. ""With the lack of evidence, he might as well also blame aliens from outer space for the fires."" While a fire at the U.S. Army's Fort Huachuca is 100% contained, according to Van Vleet, the Monument fire itself was 27% contained as of Saturday afternoon -- an improvement over the 15% figure in the morning, but certainly dangerous given the inordinately dry and windy conditions. ""This has been the number one priority in the country for a couple of days,"" Tidwell said. ""That means this will receive resources before anyone else."" Van Vleet noted 764 people, including 23 crews, 54 engines and various aircraft were battling the blaze. The temperature in that area hit 92 degrees Fahrenheit during the day, with humidity low at 12% -- ""which is pretty bad,"" the spokesman said. The Monument fire, just south of Sierra Vista, Arizona, grew dramatically Friday, racing down from canyons and gobbling parched grasslands and brush, not to mention torching at least 40 homes. Garry Foss, who operates Oaks of the Wild West nursery in Hereford, a community just east of the fire, said grasses 2 to 3 feet tall have not seen rain since December, making for a ready fire fuel source. Sierra Vista has had 0.13 inches of rain this year, according to Glenn Lader of the National Weather Service office in Tucson, compared with 2.5 to 3 inches in a normal year. There's no rain in the forecast. ""I'm trying to sit it out,"" Foss said. ""This grass is so dry."" Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer has issued emergency declarations for the Monument fire and another blaze, Horseshoe II, making Cochise County eligible for $100,000 toward response and recovery expenses. Meanwhile, residents of the eastern Arizona community of Alpine got some good news with the lifting of an evacuation order at 10 a.m. Saturday, according to fire spokesman John Helmich. The community has a population of about 300, but many more seasonal visitors were forced to leave earlier this month because of the historically large Wallow fire. The Wallow fire, which burned 500,409 acres, was 38% contained Saturday. ""There have been no surprises,"" said Helmich, of the Alpine residents' return. ""It is ongoing."" Arizona wasn't the only state struggling with wildfires this weekend. The National Weather Service had issued red-flag alerts for much of the state, all of New Mexico, and parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado and Utah. Such alerts indicate firefighting conditions may prove difficult due to low humidity and wind gusts in excess of 40 miles per hour. ""We are having an extremely dry year all the way across the south,"" Tidwell said. The U.S. Forest Service chief said earlier Saturday at the same press conference attended by McCain that he was ""very optimistic"" that damage from future wildfires could be minimized by thinning forests and clearing out biomass -- which did occur, to some extent, in parts of eastern Arizona. He noted that 3.2 million acres were ""treated"" nationwide last year. He and senators McCain and John Kyl, R-Arizona, noted Saturday that parts of the Wallow fire that had been ""treated"" appeared set to survive the blaze, which stretched over 40 miles, while those that had not had been wiped out. ""With the forest restoration work, we can change the intensity of fire behavior,"" Tidwell said. ""That's forest resiliency -- that's what we want to work on."" Kyl noted that the estimated $64.1 million price for the Wallow fire would more than double after the costs of mitigation efforts to prevent mudslides from the summer monsoons. ""Just think that what we could have done using those funds to treat those forests in advance,"" Kyl said. But government budget strains have limited the amount of money going to such efforts. McCain said ""the only way we are going to get these (forests) thinned is through greater participation of private enterprise"" -- adding the government should try to facilitate such initiatives, including by allowing limited logging in national parks. ""There is simply not enough tax dollars to get the job done without them,"" McCain said of private companies.

"(CNN) -- A graduate student is suing a Georgia university, alleging that professors are requiring her to change her ""biblical views"" on homosexuality or be expelled from the counseling program there. Jennifer Keeton filed a civil rights action in U.S. District Court on July 21 saying Augusta State University violated her ""constitutional rights of speech, belief and religious exercise."" The action says university faculty have ""promised to expel"" Keeton ""because she has communicated both inside and outside the classroom that she holds to Christian ethical conviction on matters of human sexuality and gender identity."" After Keeton expressed her views verbally and in written assignments, faculty mandated Keeton complete a ""remediation plan."" CNN obtained a copy of the remediation plan from the Alliance Defense Fund, which represents Keeton in the action. The plan addresses issues such as writing ability and organizational skills, as well as Keeton's ability to be a ""multiculturally competent counselor, particularly in regard to working with gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and queer/questioning populations."" Among the plan's requirements, Keeton was to attend at least three diversity workshops, get more exposure to gay populations (one suggestion was to attend a gay pride parade in Augusta, where the university is located), do outside reading about gays and write reflections on these experiences and how they might benefit future clients. At first, Keeton agreed to the remediation plan, according to the suit. Then, she had second thoughts. In video provided by the Alliance Defense Fund, Keeton says, ""I want to stay in the school counseling program, [but] I can't honestly complete the remediation program knowing I would have to alter by beliefs. I'm not willing to -- and I know I can't -- change my biblical views."" In a statement to CNN, Augusta State said it ""does not discriminate against any individuals on the basis of their personal, social, political, or religious beliefs or views. No student is asked to change their religious beliefs or views in order to participate in any program."" Without commenting specifically on the Keeton suit, the university also said, ""The professional counselor's job is to help clients clarify their current feelings and behaviors and to help them reach the goals that they have determined for themselves, not to dictate what those goals should be, what morals they should possess, or what values they should adopt."" In an interview Wednesday on ""CNN NewsRoom,"" David French, a senior counsel with the Alliance Defense Fund, said all Keeton did ""was express her religious views inside of class and outside of class."" ""As a result of that, she's being subjected to what is best described as a thought-reform program,"" French said. ""It all goes back to a student engaging in constitutionally protected speech."" French added there was no allegation Keeton has done anything to harm anyone in a counseling setting, or violated any code of ethics. Also appearing on the program were Erin Martz, manager of Ethics and Professional Standards for the American Counseling Association, and Gregory Nevins, a supervising senior staff attorney for the advocacy group Lambda Legal. Martz said the ACA's code of ethics ""is not an issue of thought-policing or putting any restrictions on beliefs of any kind."" ""The code is concerned with counselors' behaviors and how they interact with their clients,"" she said. ""Talking to others -- espousing ideas about homosexuality or other beliefs is a behavior,"" Martz said. ""And if that behavior goes into imposing values, that does become an issue."" French said the remediation program itself seeks to change Keeton's beliefs. He said while the ACA code prohibits imposing values, ""these counseling professors have won the gold medal in the Olympics of imposing values by trying to change her religious beliefs."" ""This is not an issue about conduct in any form of a counseling setting,"" French said. ""This is a First Amendment issue about freedom of expression."" Nevins, the attorney for Lambda Legal, said the potential problem is that ""many people, especially young people in the coming-out or questioning process, are looking for a sympathetic and understanding ear. ""To have somebody who is going to introduce their value system in a negative way can be extremely damaging,"" he said. French said Keeton has repeatedly told the counseling department she would uphold the valid code of ethics of the American Counseling Association. Asked how Keeton would respond in a hypothetical situation of a child coming to her and saying he was gay, French said Keeton would respond in an ""ethical and appropriate way."" French said the counseling department has imposed its own set of values to ""cleanse"" Christianity from students' belief system, violating its own ethics code. When Nevins mentioned that Keeton espoused ""conversion therapy,"" French said the allegation was unsubstantiated. Nevins said Keeton's or anyone's belief system had to be ""pushed to one side."" Martz concurred, saying, ""In the counseling profession, as with the medical profession, the needs of the client supercede the needs of the counselor."" Keeton's suit asks for nominal and actual damages based on violation of her civil rights.

"Attention all snowbirds: If you're looking for the best retreat this season, go West, you travelers, go West. The western half of the Lower 48 is forecast to have a warmer-than-average winter.

The Pacific weather system known as El Nino isn't behaving as expected, forecasters say. In fact, it hasn't even fully developed yet. El Nino indicates warmer ocean water in the equatorial Pacific, and that influences the jet stream and gives forecasters confidence in their work. ""This is one of the most challenging outlooks we've produced in recent years because El Nino decided not to show up as expected,"" Mike Halpert, center deputy director, said in a statement. ""In fact, it stalled out last month, leaving neutral conditions in place in the tropical Pacific."" Forecasters are keeping an eye out for El Nino. The official 2012 U.S. winter outlook favors warmer-than-average temperatures in much of Texas; the Central and Northern Plains; the Southwest; the Northern Rockies; eastern Washington, Oregon and California; and the northern two-thirds of Alaska, the center said.

"(CNN) -- He's a youth icon in Japan seeking to take the ancient art of kabuki theater into the modern age. Kabuki actor Ichikawa Ebizo . Talk Asia gets unprecedented backstage access to Ichikawa as he prepares for a spectacular performance, discussing his life in the media glare and how he felt the pull of destiny in pursuing a career in kabuki. Born into one of the most prestigious kabuki dynasties, Ichikawa Ebizo began his career at the age of six and became a star with his mixture of athletic ability and enigmatic personal image. As the poster boy for a new generation of kabuki, Ichikawa doesn't feel he has to play up the flashy image that is portrayed in the media. ""Today, I love kabuki, kabuki is my life and very important to me. I accept it as my destiny as well. So rather than me becoming a star or whatever, I am very conscious that I am a creature who must carry on my family's DNA,"" he told CNN. By taking kabuki overseas to a new audience, Ichikawa believes that as well as promoting the artform he is helping to reinvigorate interest back home in Japan. ""I asked myself whether doing my best in Japan is all that I can do for Kabuki. It isn't. Then, I came up with the idea of performing overseas. I thought it would be great if the Japanese could renew their interest in Kabuki if we performed successfully overseas,"" he told CNN. ""However, when I performed under the name 'Ebizo Ichikawa' at Chaillot Theater in Paris, I was inspired by how seriously the audience watched the art and reacted to my performance.

"Japan's new defense white paper has done little to mend fences with Beijing, with the Chinese government complaining that its Asian neighbor is using the ""China threat"" to justify a bigger defense budget. Japan will spend about $49 billion on defense in the fiscal year to March 2015 -- up about 3% from the previous year -- in the face of what it says is a worsening security environment in the region. It cites tensions on the Korean peninsula and territorial disputes in the sea lanes running south from northern Asia as its key concerns. Under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Japan is becoming more assertive about its defense posture, and is looking to upgrade its military over the next four years with bigger helicopter carriers, more anti-submarine patrol aircraft, surveillance drones, better amphibious warfare capability, and first deliveries in 2018 of its new fifth-generation fighter, the U.S.-made F35 Joint Strike Fighter. In terms of regional defense, Japan benefits substantially from its security alliance with the United States, and is a big buyer of U.S.-made weaponry. It also builds its own submarines, surface ships and fighter variants. China, which will likely spend about $200 billion this financial year on defense -- second only to the United States -- is a significant buyer of Russian aircraft, ships and submarines, but is concentrating on its own domestic capabilities. It launched its first aircraft carrier in late 2012, with two more likely to be built by the end of this decade. It is also developing its own fifth-generation stealth fighter, the twin-engined J20, with the first deployment expected in 2018. Dangerous activities . Japan's annual defense document, approved by the Abe cabinet on August 5, says Chinese ships and aircraft have engaged in ""dangerous activities"" in disputed areas such as the South China and East China Seas, and these could have ""unintended consequences."" China's Defense Ministry quickly rejected the Japanese claim, calling it simply an excuse for Japan's own military expansion. It said it strongly opposed Japan's ""ignorance of facts"" and its ""groundless accusations"" about China's military development. Japan says China needs to be more transparent about the reasons behind what Tokyo calls a ""broad and rapid"" buildup of Chinese military might. It says China hasn't been clear about the rationale for its expansion. In the air, China already has more frontline fighters than Japan, with the Chinese combat arsenal including advanced Russian SU-27 and SU-30 planes, and the domestic J10, J11 and J16. Japan has about 260 planes, including about 200 F15s, its mainstay fighter. Qualitatively, Japan still is seen to have an edge because of its close integration with the Japan-based U.S. military forces, in areas such as early warning, electronic warfare and refueling. By 2018, that air superiority could tilt to China, depending on how smoothly the roll-out proceeds respectively for China's J20 and the Japanese variant of the U.S. F35. U.S. pivot . For the United States, the China-Japan defense spending spat is another point of Asia-Pacific regional tension. The administration of U.S. President Barack Obama wants to expand and maintain good relations with China, but is mindful that Japan hosts most of the key U.S. forward bases in the region. Plus there is a powerful economic incentive: Asia-Pacific continues to be a major focus of arms sales for the U.S., in competition with Russia, some European suppliers, and China itself. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), global military spending last year was about $1.75 trillion, with the top 15 nations accounting for about $1.4 trillion of that. It ascribed a figure of $640 billion to the U.S. in 2013, followed by China on $188 billion. Russia ranked third, with a 2013 spend of about $88 billion, ahead of Saudi Arabia ($67 billion), France ($61 billion), UK ($58 billion), and Germany ($48.8 billion). Japan, India and South Korea ranked 8th, 9th and 10th in 2013, according to SIPRI's calculations. U.S. military spending declined in 2013 and is budgeted to fall again in the year to September 2014 to about $526 billion. In contrast, SIPRI says that China, Russia and Saudi Arabia have more than doubled their military spending since 2004. Territorial spat . China and Japan have a long-standing territorial dispute in the East China Sea over a group of islands known in Japan as the Senkakus and in China as the Diaoyutai. The islands lie about 111 miles (180 kilometers) northeast of Taiwan and about 248 miles (400 kilometers) west of Okinawa. The area has seen a number of air and sea confrontations in recent years -- a point highlighted in the Japanese defense white paper. It says: ""China has intruded into Japanese territorial waters frequently and violated Japan's airspace by its government ships and aircraft belonging to maritime law-enforcement agencies, and has engaged in dangerous activities that could cause unintended consequences, such as its vessel's direction of a fire control radar at a JMSDF destroyer, the flight of fighters abnormally close to JSDF  aircraft, and  its  announcement  of  establishing  the  'East  China  Sea  Air  Defense Identification  Zone'  based  on  its  own  assertion  thereby  infringing  the  freedom  of  overflight over the high seas."" In response, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on August 8 that there was ""nothing disputable"" about China carrying out ""normal maritime and air activities which are consistent with international laws and relevant domestic laws and regulations."" The spokesperson said China was exercising its legitimate rights and interests in establishing the East China Sea ADIZ, and was ""in conformity with international laws and common practices."" Japan also has a territorial dispute with South Korea over the Takeshima/Dokdo group of islands in the Sea of Japan/East Sea. South Korea complained that the Japanese defense white paper included the disputed islets as Japanese territory and called on Japan to withdraw what it termed an ""unjust claim."" Further south, in the South China Sea, China is in dispute with Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia and Taiwan over competing claims to various islets and rocky outcrops.","Japan will spend about $49 billion on defense in the fiscal year to March 2015 .

"Louis and Bonnie Waterer are spending their retirement filling up their passports, one stamp at a time. ""There are a bunch of people who are trying to visit 100 countries before they die,"" Louis explained. ""This is number 92 for us."" Country No. 92 for the Waterers is Cuba. But up until a few years ago, even for intrepid travelers like the Waterers, visiting Cuba would have been close to impossible. After Fidel Castro took power in 1959, Cuba went from being a favorite getaway for Americans to a forbidden destination. Diplomatic relations and direct travel between the United States and Cuba were cut off. U.S. citizens spending money on the island faced hefty fines for ""trading with the enemy."" But after decades of false starts, the Obama administration has reinstituted legal travel to Cuba as a way to reach out to the Cuban people. It's called ""people-to-people"" travel, and like nearly everything involving Cuba, controversy and politics are involved. ""Each traveler must have a full-time schedule of educational exchange activities that will result in meaningful interaction between the travelers and individuals in Cuba,"" U.S. Treasury Department guidelines for people-to-people travel read. And while the policy has kicked off a debate over what is a ""meaningful"" exchange, a flood of tour operators has entered the still uncertain world of travel to Cuba. Americans interested in visiting Cuba are offered free CDs of Cuban music and itineraries that include welcome parties thrown by Committees for the Defense of the Revolution, neighborhood watch groups that were created with the original intention of thwarting a U.S. invasion. U.S. visitors coming via people-to-people trips shouldn't plan on too much beach time. Under the Treasury guidelines, tour operators have to plan nearly every moment of the trip, and ""people-to-people"" travel, at least in theory, excludes relaxing by the pool with umbrella-topped beverages. Most Americans heading to Cuba go there with the desire to make a connection with a people they have been prevented from having any contact with  for generations, according to Tom Popper, president of tour operator Insight Cuba. ""The fact that we are bringing Americans and Cubans together is an incredible thing,"" Popper said.  ""It's a travel experience for the Americans, it's an incredible thing for Cubans. Some people in parts of Cuba that we go to, they have never met an American before."" People-to-people travel isn't cheap or easy, though. A four-night ""Weekend in Havana"" trip from Insight Cuba, without airfare, sells for about $2,000 per person. Popper said the high cost of the trips is due to the fact that operators need to send guides with their groups to make sure they comply with the travel regulations, and that renewing the yearly U.S. licenses can take months of navigating a complicated bureaucracy. This summer, many tour operators wondered if people-to-people travel was ending altogether, after the Treasury Department started denying licenses to operators or simply not responding to renewal requests. Several tour operators contacted by CNN said that the process may have gotten bogged down by the fact that the renewal application is now close to 200 pages and requires that the operators explain how each stop on the itinerary fosters greater friendship between Americans and Cubans. ""You are doing what you are supposed to be doing and they are changing the rules as we go. The guidelines are so vague,"" said Michael Sykes, who ran the now-defunct Cuba Cultural Tours. Sykes laid off four employees after his license expired in July and he was denied a renewal. ""The language is so cryptic and so bureaucratic,"" he said. ""Your average Joe isn't able to do this -- you have to understand the secret language."" Sykes has now hired what he calls a ""bloody expensive"" lawyer to guide him through the process, and he is hopeful that he will be back to planning trips to Cuba by the end of the year. Some of the tour operators said they thought the logjam of licenses was caused by political pressure, particularly from Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, who is Cuban-American and a fierce critic of the trips . ""What these trips are all about is tourism -- it's tourism,"" Rubio said on the Senate floor last year. ""The reason why this is problematic is it gives money to the Castro government."" Jeff Braunger, a Treasury Department official in charge of the Cuba licensing program, said in an e-mail that the department has approved licenses for 180 tour operators while making sure they are complying with the law. ""We revised the license application criteria to stress to applicants the seriousness of the requirements of the people-to-people licensing program, in part because of reports we received concerning travel under the licenses,"" Braunger wrote. But some tour operators said travel to Cuba has become more cumbersome and expensive but is not policed any better. One tour organizer mentioned a recent licensed trip offered by a competitor that included a day of scuba diving. ""It's supposed to be people-to-people, not people-to-fish,"" the operator said. And there are also complications on the Cuban side, tour operators said. Last month, the Cuban government abruptly canceled the landing rights for two of the U.S. charter companies operating flights to the island, reportedly over a payment dispute. But most of the tour operators said the headaches are worth the opportunity to get in early on American tourism to Cuba, which is sure to explode when the embargo is eventually lifted. ""We are back in operations and hope to stay that way,"" Insight Cuba president Tom Popper said. Popper had to lay off 22 people as he waited several months for the company's license renewal, but he has since added 17 back to his staff. On a trip organized by Insight Cuba last month, 12 Americans spent their morning speaking with Cubans at a neighborhood art project. Michael Pettit, a lawyer from Charleston, South Carolina, said he was struck by Cuba's many contrasts during his first people-to-people trip in May. ""I love Cuba,"" he said. ""The history, music, people, photography -- it's all beautiful."" The politics and uncertainty over continued travel between Cuba and the United States persuaded Pettit to book another trip right away, he said. ""One of the reasons I came again is because you never know when you might be able to come legally.""","Legal travel to Cuba has been off limits to Americans for decades .

"When ""Daily Show"" host Jon Stewart tore into Sen. Dianne Feinstein for complaining about the CIA removing classified documents from her staff's computers after giving the intelligence community a pass on spying on private citizens, he joined a chorus of civil liberties advocates who say she's being hypocritical. ""What is incredible about these accusations is they are not coming from Senator Ron 'Privacy is important' Wyden or Senator Rand 'Don't kill me with a flying robot' Paul,""  Stewart said. ""They are coming from Dianne 'So the NSA is looking at your data'  Feinstein."" He then played a montage of clips showing the many instances in which Feinstein, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has supported National Security Agency snooping on private citizens. Those who have long complained that neither Congress nor the intelligence community have done enough to safeguard the rights of private citizens find it ironic that, for months, the spy agency and the Intelligence Committee charged with its oversight have waged a behind-the-scenes battle accusing each other of improper snooping. The Justice Department is weighing whether to investigate CIA claims that Intelligence Committee staffers accessed material they shouldn't have seen while reviewing millions of documents at a Virginia facility. Those same advocates find the complaints of Feinstein, who has been one of the intelligence community's staunchest supporters, as especially disingenuous. Feinstein says CIA spied on Senate computers . ""As a privacy advocate, she has gotten angry about spying on (German Chancellor) Angela Merkel and spying on herself. But being OK with spying on the rest of us is questionable,"" said Mike German, a former FBI agent and a fellow with the Brenna Center for Justice. Feinstein did not respond to a request for comment. During a fiery speech Tuesday that stunned lawmakers and members of the intelligence community, Feinstein, a California Democrat, accused the CIA of secretly taking classified documents from her staff's computers during an oversight investigation. Her comments made public a private long running saga over the review of documents related to the post 9/11 Bush administration program for questioning terror suspects -- a practice that ultimately was ended by President Barack Obama in 2009. CIA Director John Brennan challenged Feinstein's claims. What are the CIA and Senate fighting about? Privacy advocates and civil liberty groups hailed Feinstein's diatribe against the CIA's tactics as a watershed moment in urging stronger checks on the executive branch's spying practices. ""It's highly significant that a senator with Senator Feinstein's credentials in working with the intelligence community would go to the Senate floor and make a constitutionally protected speech about how the CIA is undermining a critical oversight role,"" said Greg Nojeim, a senior counsel with the nonprofit Center for Democracy and Technology. A number of her congressional colleagues applauded her speech as well. ""Senator Feinstein is a dedicated public servant who deserves enormous credit for speaking publicly about this dispute, which goes to the heart of the separation of powers,"" Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, told CNN in a statement. ""She has spoken to the conscience of every senator, of both parties. She is standing up for the principles on which this country was founded, and the rest of us must follow her example,"" he said. Leahy has been a steady critic of the intelligence community's practices -- especially the sweeping NSA surveillance programs publicized by Edward Snowden's leaks -- and has stridently questioned claims by national security officials that the government's bulk collection of phone records thwarted terror attacks. However, privacy and civil liberties advocates took issue with Feinstein's pique. They also see a double-standard in the outrage of other lawmakers such as Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who also called the allegations ""dangerous to a democracy."" These types of actions have always been ""dangerous to a democracy"" even when they happen to ordinary private citizens, civil liberties advocates said. ""It's clear the CIA was trying to play 'keep-away' with documents relevant to an investigation by their overseers in Congress, and that's a serious constitutional concern,"" Snowden, a former NSA contractor, told NBC News in a statement Tuesday. ""But it's equally if not more concerning that we're seeing another 'Merkel Effect,' where an elected official does not care at all that the rights of millions of ordinary citizens are violated by our spies, but suddenly it's a scandal when a politician finds out the same thing happens to them,"" he said. House intel chair warns of penalty if CIA searched Senate computers . Privacy and civil liberty advocates hope more oversight will occur now that members of Congress have gotten a personal taste of intelligence gathering practices they find objectionable. ""We've had 12 years of an intelligence community acting with very little checks on it,"" said Chris Anders, a senior legislative counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union. ""The reason they are so out of control is that there's been very little oversight being exercised by Congress or the courts."" Outrage by both lawmakers and private citizens will build support for reforms, German said. ""Hopefully, now that Feinstein has this new found skepticism, she will open the lid so that the American public can see what has been done in their name in the past ten years,"" German said.","Privacy and civil liberties advocates skeptical of Feinstein's CIA snooping complaints .

"The United States is launching an effort to save some of its busiest workers: honey bees. President Barack Obama created a task force comprising various agencies to address the issue of rapidly diminishing honey bees and other pollinators. Honey bees pollinate fruit, nuts and vegetables, and are crucial for the nation's food industry. They have declined sharply in recent years due to various factors, including pesticides, mite infestations and loss of genetic diversity, the White House said Friday. ""Pollination is integral to food security in the United States,"" it said. ""Honey bees enable the production of at least 90 commercially grown crops in North America. Globally, 87 of the leading 115 food crops evaluated are dependent on animal pollinators."" During pollination, insects, birds, butterflies and bats transfer pollen between plants, which allows them to make seeds and reproduce. In addition to food sustainability, honey bees boost the economy. ""Pollinators contribute more than $24 billion to the United States economy, of which honey bees account for more than $15 billion through their vital role in keeping fruits, nuts, and vegetables in our diets,"" the White House said. In California, the almond industry is at risk because it depends on 1.4 million beehives annually for pollination. Almonds rely exclusively on bees for pollination. The number of managed honey bee colonies in the United States fell sharply from 6 million beehives in 1947 to 2.5 million today, according to the White House. Obama said the Environmental Protection Agency and United States Department of Agriculture will spearhead an effort to determine why honey bees, monarch butterflies and other pollinators are dwindling and find ways to boost their conservation. In addition, Obama's budget for next year recommends about $50 million for multiple agencies to help boost research, increase the number of acres dedicated to pollinators' conservation programs and boost funding for research on pollinator losses.

"For more than two decades, Chester Nez kept silent about his role as one of the original Navajo code talkers responsible for developing an unbreakable code during World War II. His death Wednesday at his home in Albuquerque, New Mexico, at age 93 was lamented by the Marine Corps as the end of an era -- for both the country and its armed forces. ""We mourn his passing but honor and celebrate the indomitable spirit and dedication of those Marines who became known as the Navajo code talkers,"" the Marines said in a statement. Nez was the last remaining of the original 29 Navajos recruited by the Marine Corps to develop the legendary code that was used for vital communications during battle. He was a teenager when he was recruited in 1942 and assigned with the other code talkers to the Marine Corps' 382nd Platoon at Camp Pendleton. Together, they created a code, including developing a dictionary. Military authorities chose Navajo as a code language because its syntax and tonal qualities were almost impossible for a non-Navajo to learn, and it had no written form. The ranks of the Navajo code talkers swelled to more than 300 by the end of the war in 1945. The code talkers were forbidden from telling anyone about it -- not their fellow Marines, not their families -- until their work was declassified in 1968. The original 29 were presented with the Congressional Gold Medal in 2001 by President George W. Bush. ""In developing our code, we were careful to use everyday Navajo words, so that we could memorize and retain the words easily,"" Nez told CNN in 2011 while promoting his book ""Code Talker."" ""I think that made our job easier, and I think it helped us to be successful in the heat of battle."" Still, Nez said he worried every day that an error might cost the life of an American military service member. Nez was among the code talkers who were shipped out to Guadalcanal in 1942, where the code talkers worked in teams of two, with one relaying and receiving messages while the other cranked the portable radio and listened for errors in transmission. ""That was my first combat experience, and there was a lot of suffering and a lot of the condition was real bad out there,"" he told CNN's Larry King in 2002. Nez also fought in Guam and Peleliu. ""When bombs dropped, generally we code talkers couldn't just curl up in a shelter,"" Nez wrote in his book. ""We were almost always needed to transmit information, to ask for supplies and ammunition, and to communicate strategies. And after each transmission, to avoid Japanese fire, we had to move."" The code talkers faced initial resistance from fellow Marines who did not understand who they were and what they were doing. That changed once they understood the importance of the code, Nez said. The Navajo code baffled the Japanese, who had successfuly deciphered codes used by the U.S. Army.  After the war, the Japanese chief of intelligence, Lt. General Seizo Arisue, admitted they were never able to crack the Navajo code used by the Marines and Navy, according to the Navy. Nez was discharged in 1945, but later volunteered to fight in the Korean War. After the code talkers' exploits were declassified by the military, the group gained legendary status with books and, ultimately, a movie that was inspired by their stories. ""The recognition of the code talkers came late, but it has been good for my Navajo people. I hope that this type of recognition continues across cultures,"" Nez said. The 2002 film ""Windtalkers,"" starring Adam Beach and Nicolas Cage, followed the fictional account of two Marines assigned to protect two code talkers during the battle of Saipan. ""I could understand when they sent the message and received on the other end,"" Nez said. ""I could understand, and I could sit there and write it down myself. I still remember it."" It was a far cry from his childhood, when he was forced to attend a boarding school and punished by the teachers for speaking Navajo, according to his book. It's a language, though, that appears lost even to many members of his own family. ""My own children do not speak Navajo, although my daughter-in-law ... speaks it well,"" he said. Nez said he decided to tell his story because he wanted to share the contributions and sacrifices of the Navajo during World War II. ""Our Navajo code was one of the most important military secrets of World War II. The fact that the Marines did not tell us Navajo men how to develop that code indicated their trust in us and in our abilities,"" he said. ""The feeling that I could make it in both the white world and the Navajo world began there, and it has stayed with me all of my life. For that I am grateful."" The Navajo Nation's flags have been ordered lowered in Nez's honor, President Ben Shelly said. People we have lost in 2014 .","As a child, Chester Nez was punished for speaking Navajo .

"Vice President Joe Biden stressed Monday that he and Benjamin Netanyahu are ""still buddies"" during remarks to the Jewish Federations of North America, less than two weeks after a senior Obama administration official was quoted calling the Israeli prime minister ""chickens---"" ""You better damn well report to Bibi that we're still buddies,"" Biden said at the top of his remarks, speaking specifically to Israeli ambassador Ron Dermer, who was in the audience. (""Bibi"" is a nickname for Netanyahu.) ""I signed a picture for Bibi a long time ago—I have a bad habit of, no one ever doubts I mean what I say, sometimes I say all that I mean, though—and I signed a picture a long time for Bibi,"" Biden continued. ""He's been a friend for over 30 years. I said 'Bibi I don't agree with a damn thing you say but I love you.'"" Joe Biden: 'I'm not changing' Biden continued to emphasize that ""we really are good friends"" and later called him a ""great, great friend,"" though he did not specifically mention the ""chickens---"" comments. His comment marked the first time that Biden addressed the group since the quote by the unnamed official — reported by The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg — underscored the awkward relationship between President Barack Obama's administration and Israel. Biden says use of term 'Shylocks' was a poor choice . The Vice President said Israel has no other friend like the United States, and that Obama has met with Netanyahu more than any other world leader. ""Like all close friends, we talk honestly with one another. We talk directly with one another. We disagree with one another. We love one another, and we drive one another crazy,"" he said. ""That's what friends do. There is never a miss between the cup and the lip here. We are straight with one another."" Biden went on in his remarks to spell out the ""moral obligation"" that the United States has to help Israel. ""My father pointed out to me I did not need to be a Jew to be a Zionist, for I am. Israel is essential for security of Jews worldwide,"" he said. ""And a state of Palestine. Each enjoin security, self-determination, and mutual recognition."" He also tried to take a clear line on Iran's nuclear capacity. ""We will not let Iran acquire a nuclear weapon. Period. Period. Period,"" he said. ""And I would not put my 42 year reputation on the line were I not certain when I say, we mean it.""","Vice President Joe Biden said that he and Benjamin Netanyahu are ""still buddies.""
His comments come after an Obama administration official had harsh words about the Israeli leader."
"President Barack Obama and congressional leaders described similar proposals Tuesday for ending the National Security Agency's sweeping collection of bulk telephone records. Obama told reporters in The Netherlands that his intelligence team gave him a ""workable"" option for NSA reform that he said would ""eliminate "" concerns about how the government keeps the records known as metadata. At a news conference in Washington, the leaders of the House Intelligence Committee said they worked out their own bipartisan compromise on a similar proposal intended to alleviate what they characterized as unfounded fears of excessive government surveillance. The nearly simultaneous remarks demonstrated progress toward Obama's call in January for NSA changes in the aftermath of last year's classified leaks by former agency contractor Edward Snowden that revealed the magnitude of surveillance programs created in response to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Congressional battle coming . However, the issue touches on deep political and ideological fissures between Republicans and Democrats, promising an extended battle in Congress over the necessary legislation -- especially in an election year. A senior administration official told CNN that the White House plan, first reported by The New York Times, would ensure ""the government no longer collects or holds"" the telephone metadata -- records that include the numbers and time of calls, but no content such as the actual conversation. According to the official, the proposal ""still ensures that the government has access to the information it needs"" for national security purposes. The official declined to specify where the bulk phone metadata would ultimately be stored. Now it is collected by the NSA under broad legal authority to keep it for five years. It was not immediately clear how the White House proposal differed from the compromise announced by Reps. Mike Rogers of Michigan and Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland -- the top Republican and Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. Their plan would end the automatic NSA collection of phone metadata, with telecommunications companies keeping such records for at least 18 months -- as they do now. Court approval . Two layers of court approval would be needed to access the records -- one for the overall surveillance program seeking the information, and another for the specific foreign phone number being investigated, the legislators said. The Snowden leaks unleashed a political firestorm, with privacy advocates and others calling the NSA surveillance programs a violation of constitutional rights. In particular, many Americans feared inevitable abuse of a system in which the government collected billions of phone records for possible review in terrorism investigations. Snowden, now living in Russia while seeking asylum from U.S. prosecution, has repeatedly described the surveillance programs illuminated  by his leaks as unconstitutional. Several legal challenges have been mounted against the NSA programs, and some of those cases could reach the Supreme Court in coming years to set up a judicial review of the constitutional limits of government surveillance in the post 9/11 era. Obama and the two House legislators all said Tuesday the current system was legal, but needed changing to reassure a skeptical public . Obama: ""People were concerned"" In The Hague, Obama argued that ""clear safeguards"" exist against ""some of the dangers that people hypothesize when it came to bulk data."" ""But I recognize that people were concerned about what might happen in the future with that bulk data,"" he said. ""This proposal that's been presented to me would eliminate that concern."" Rogers argued no abuses occurred under the present system, but he acknowledged public concern about the possibility of problems down the road if the government kept such vast stores of information. ""That's really what we're trying to do here is alleviate that concern that there could be abuse in the future of these programs,"" he said. Authorization for the current NSA programs expires on Friday, and Obama will seek a temporary renewal until Congress passes reform legislation, the senior administration official said. News of the proposed changes came during Obama's trip to Europe, where he's mobilizing support for isolating Russia over its military occupation and annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. Snowden's leaks put the NSA's surveillance activities under global scrutiny. The revelations included U.S. spying on European allies and others, sparking diplomatic protests. Nine months of negotiations . In January, Obama outlined a series of steps -- some immediate and some requiring time to work out, possibly with Congress -- that would change aspects of the NSA collection of phone records and other information but generally leave intact the core and function of existing programs. Rogers and Ruppersberger said Tuesday that nine months of negotiations involving the intelligence community and other stakeholders led to their proposed legislation. The White House was involved in the discussions, Ruppersberger said, while Rogers noted the Obama proposal came out after the committee shared its plan with the White House earlier this week. He noted that more work remains to be done to narrow differences with the White House and the Senate. ""We're feeling pretty good about people starting to coalesce around a solution,"" Rogers said, adding that ""there will be people who are married to their own positions."" Initial reaction to the White House plan included praise with some caution. Step forward . Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, a leading critic of the NSA surveillance programs, said news of the White House plan amounted to an executive branch retreat. ""For years, the executive branch said it was essential to have this information, that it was indispensable,"" Wyden said, noting he and colleagues argued against that notion. ""Today's exciting news for the constitutional rights of the American people is the administration said they agree with us."" Michelle Richardson, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, called the reported White House plan ""a crucial first step towards reining in the NSA's overreaching surveillance."" ""The change would replace the dragnet surveillance of millions of innocent people with targeted methods that are both effective and respect Americans' constitutional rights,"" Richardson said, adding: ""It is critical that the administration also end other bulk collection programs.""","Democratic Sen.

"Frankfurt, Germany (CNN) -- The Japanese women's soccer team won the World Cup after defeating the United States on penalty kicks Sunday night, rallying from a pair of one-goal deficits to capture its first-ever world title. Japan had come into the tournament as sentimental favorites, helping rally a nation that had been devastated by a March 11 earthquake and subsequent tsunami and nuclear disaster. For the United States, it was more a disappointment -- especially considering that the team twice relinquished leads. While  the U.S. had the most chances during the run of play, the Japanese  dominated the penalty-kick phase 3-1 to earn the win. The Americans dug  themselves a hole by missing their first three kicks. ""We lost to a great team, we really did,"" U.S. goalkeeper Hope Solo told ESPN, which broadcast the game. ""I truly believe that something bigger was pulling for this team."" Americans gathered in bars, living rooms and other places rode an emotional roller coaster, their hopes high on multiple occassions only to be dashed in the end. Japanese residents were also glued to their televisions, despite the game starting around 4 a.m. local time. In one Tokyo eatery, for instances, scores adorned in the team's colors burst out in joy once their team beat the U.S. squad for the first time in 26 tries. The shoot-out was mandated only after Japanese midfielder Homare Sawa scored with a few minutes left in extra time, tying the score 2-2. Japan answered a U.S. goal -- also in the overtime period -- when U.S. forward Abby Wambach put her team ahead by heading home a pass from Alex Morgan into the back of the net. There were many heroes for Japan. One of them was Aya Miyama, who tied up the score with 10 minutes left in regulation by finishing off a scramble in front of the net. Before then, Japan had its back against the wall after Morgan herself scored the game's first goal. This came after the Americans controlled much of the early action, but couldn't capitalize. In the first-half alone, a U.S. player hit a goal-post, and on another occasion, Wambach rattled the crossbar. Japan also had its own point-blank chance about 30 minutes into the game; that was saved by Solo, the American goalkeeper. It was more of the same in the second half, with Morgan ringing a ball off the post from several feet away just three minutes in. Then, Japanese goalkeeper Ayumi Kaihori tapped a Wambach header just over the crossbar 15 minutes later. The game -- which began at 8:45 p.m. (2:45 p.m. ET) in Frankfurt, Germany -- capped an eventful tournament that saw a number of favorites including Brazil, Sweden and the host nation of Germany fall by the wayside. The Japanese shocked the host nation in the quarterfinals. In that same round, the U.S. team needed last-minute heroics to beat Brazil and advance. Team USA had been hoping -- and ultimately failed -- to become the first squad to win the women's World Cup three times, having also captured the title in 1991 and 1999. Steve Sklar, one of tens of thousands of Americans who watched Sunday's game, said the U.S. team succeeded in getting many of his countrymen excited about the sport. ""Anything that gets soccer played in the United States is great,"" Sklar told CNN from a New York bar, minutes after the contest ended. ""And the fact that so many watched this game is awesome."" While the U.S. team played for bragging rights and to boost the sport's profile in their home country, Japanese players were hoping to give their citizens something to smile about after this spring's massive earthquake and tsunami. ""To be in the final is, to be honest, like a dream,"" Japanese player Homare Sawa told FIFA before the game. ""We know USA are a great and strong team, but they have weak points, too, and there's always a chance to score."" The Japanese players had won over their share of fans, with Solo of the U.S. team calling them ""the sentimental favorites"" for helping to lift the spirits of their devastated nation. ""They're playing for something bigger and better than the game,"" the American goalkeeper said in a conference call prior to the match. ""When you are playing with so much heart, that's hard to play against."" The U.S. team, meanwhile, captured the hearts of Americans for its creativity, dazzling plays and free spirit. Their white-knuckle wins kept fans engrossed and revamped interest years after the team's last win in 1999, before a packed house at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke by phone with the U.S. team Sunday before the game, wishing the players good luck and telling them that America is proud of how well they've done. ""I just got the highest hopes that this great team, which has shown such resilience, will be coming back and winning for the U.S.,"" Clinton told reporters, adding that she plans to watch the game from Greece. Her daughter Chelsea Clinton was among those attending Sunday's game in Frankfurt, part of a delegation that included Jill Biden, wife of the U.S. vice president. ""This country needed someone to cheer for,"" said Cat Whitehill, who played on the last two U.S. World Cup teams, after the game. ""To see the support from so many different people, it's really neat to see."" The U.S. team was known for its energy, often evident in the locker room where the players were known to sing and dance. On the field, Swedish-born head coach Pia Sundhage said she trained them to play with verve and openness. ""I guess there's a reason they hired me from a foreign country,"" Sundhage said. ""They wanted change. It was risky to make too big of a change because then (the team) would lose a lot of confidence."" The team faced a Japanese squad that was faster and more tactical than most they'd faced, some American players said. ""They are the biggest surprise in the tournament,"" U.S. defender Ali Krieger said of her opponents, prior to Sunday's match. CNN's Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","NEW: The U.S. goalkeeper says she feels ""something bigger"" was pulling for Japan .

"Around this time each year, as I prepare for Mobile World Congress, I anticipate the flood of new and exciting innovations that will be announced, the inspiring people I'll be meeting and the general buzz around mobile on a global scale. I also hope that I will see more women in attendance at the show. It's no secret that the technology sector currently has a dearth of women in the workforce. There has already been considerable discussion and research about the fact that girls are not choosing to study STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects, how a divide exists between men and women with access to the Internet, how much GDP could increase if the number of digital jobs held by women was on a par with men...the list goes on. Clearly we need more women working in the mobile and ICT industry, and more women getting connected by mobile. In other words, we are calling for more mobile women -- empowered by mobile and upwardly mobile as a result. Making women aware of the many opportunities enabled by mobile -- and holding challenging and well-remunerated positions -- is a passion of mine. I always knew I wanted to work in an exciting and innovative industry. I recognized that computer science and telecoms were burgeoning sectors, and I pursued them knowing that this unchartered territory would be rife with opportunities. Even at the start of my career, I had a desire to make a difference in an environment that was constantly evolving and pioneering. Two decades later, the industry is still just as exciting. However, while new generations of women are increasingly embracing technology in their everyday lives, they may not realize just how dynamic it is to work in mobile and ICT. I will dispel the myth now: hardly anyone I know who works in technology is a ""geek"" who sits glued to their computer screen for 20 hours a day. Of course there are enormous opportunities for people with deep technological skills, but there are just as many for people who want to support the full potential of mobile, whether it's creating connected cars, advancing mobile commerce, or even designing the master plan for a smart city. There are opportunities to do almost anything. In fact, women in the ICT industry earn almost 9% more than those in other parts of the economy. Yet they constitute only 30% of the ICT workforce in Europe, and also often leave the industry early, missing out on the chance to get to the top. We need to make women in mobile and ICT the norm rather than the exception -- and also encourage those that are on the path not to abandon it. So how do we attract and retain more mobile women? Motivating women to work in the mobile industry needs to start from the ground up, ensuring they are given the opportunities and guidance to pursue STEM subjects in the first place, provided with practical experience like internships in the field, and also inspired by the potential of mobile to change people's lives. Many women in developing nations become mobile through ownership of their first mobile phone. The positive impact that mobile has on everyday life is perhaps felt most strongly in these markets, where mobile services provide critical connectivity, life-enhancing access to education and healthcare, and empowerment through entrepreneurship. The transformative power of mobile for women was clearly demonstrated when Iraqi operator Asiacell launched a line of products and services to target the needs of women, who at the time comprised only 20% of their subscribers. The result? Less than three years later, Asiacell has increased its female customer base to 40%, enriching the lives of nearly two million Iraqi women who are now connected and empowered with more social and financial independence. We know that regardless of their locality or social strata, the positive effect of more mobile women around the world can transcend the industry and have much wider socioeconomic benefits. So as we collectively strive to connect the next one billion users and stimulate the positive change that the mobile Internet brings, we must ensure that women will be included in this upsurge. To do this, we need to address the entire mobile ecosystem. It starts with mobilizing the stakeholders involved -- policymakers and educators, mobile operators, manufacturers, and suppliers -- and extends to women themselves recognizing the myriad opportunities for their talents in the mobile and ICT industry. As I look back on many industry events where I addressed and interacted with a large number of male colleagues, I look forward to many more where I'll be just one of many involved, dynamic, mobile women.

"In a policy shift, President Barack Obama has decided to extend the combat role of U.S. forces in  Afghanistan into 2015, allowing troops to keep fighting the Taliban and other militant groups that threaten American soldiers or the Afghan government, The New York Times reported. Back in May, the President described an exit strategy that called for an end to U.S. combat operations and the withdrawal of the U.S.-led international military force by the end of 2014. While not confirming the article, a senior administration official told CNN the change is more about force protection designed to protect U.S. personnel in Afghanistan. ""We will no longer target belligerents solely because they are members of the Taliban,"" the official said. ""To the extent that Taliban members directly threaten the United States and coalition forces in Afghanistan or provide direct support to al Qaeda, we will take appropriate measures to keep Americans safe."" The policy shift apparently will not affect the number of American troops in Afghanistan. The Times said that half the 9,800 troops would leave by the end of next year. The Times said the new presidential action will allow American planes and drones to support Afghan troops in combat. The official told CNN that ""the United States may provide combat enabler support to the [Afghan National Security Forces] in limited circumstances to prevent detrimental strategic effects to these Afghan security forces."" The United States has had troops in Afghanistan for 13 years, following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The website for Operation Enduring Freedom says 2,351 American soldiers have died in the conflict, along with 453 soldiers from the United Kingdom and 675 from other nations. The Times said two factors affected Obama's decision: the poor performance of Iraqi troops as ISIS advances across Iraq and the election of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, who welcomes an extended U.S. role more than his predecessor, Hamid Karzai. After Ghani's election, Afghanistan and the United States signed a security agreement that allows U.S. troops to stay in Afghanistan beyond the previous December deadline to withdraw. Obama had said that under the security agreement, virtually all U.S. forces would be out of Afghanistan by the end of 2016, shortly before his presidency ends. He had called for 9,800 U.S. troops to stay there after the end of 2014. The number would get cut roughly in half by the end of 2015, and a year later, the U.S. military presence would scale down to what officials described as a ""normal"" embassy security contingent. The administration official told CNN: ""Safety of our personnel is the president's first priority and our armed forces will continue to engage in operations in self-defense and in support of Afghan Security Forces.""","The New York Times: Obama decides to extend U.S. combat role in Afghanistan .

"(CNN)A hint of France's expected response to the Charlie Hebdo slaughter -- and a claim of responsibility by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula for the rampage that claimed 12 lives -- came in remarks President Francois Hollande made aboard his country's nuclear-powered Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier before it embarked to the Middle East. ""The exceptional situation that we're in must lead us to revise our rhythm for reducing personnel,"" Hollande said Wednesday, referring to military cuts planned before the attacks. That exceptional situation was a terrorist rampage that was years in the works, an AQAP leader said in a video, claiming U.S.-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki was the mastermind. Al-Awlaki was the terror group's spokesman before a U.S. drone strike killed him in Yemen in 2011. As intelligence analysts try to piece together whether the gunmen who attacked the satirical magazine met al-Awaki on trips to Yemen -- a theory that could be bolstered by the new video's claim -- France's ultimate response will be colored by numerous factors. Why deploy the Charles de Gaulle? An invasion of Yemen is unlikely. ""In terms of international engagement and what's happening in Yemen, the United States has been engaged in drone strikes for a number of years,"" says David Schanzer, director of the Triangle Center on Terrorism and Homeland Security and a professor of public policy at Duke University. ""I would think the United States is doing about everything that could be done in Yemen."" Of France's deployment of the flagship Charles de Gaulle, Schanzer said: ""I don't know how much of this is symbolic or adding to capability. I just have my doubts."" In fact, Schanzer wrote in an op-ed piece this week, France and the United States have been on a ""war footing"" against terrorism for nearly 14 years. ""As early as October 2001, France participated in NATO operations in Afghanistan against al-Qaeda and the Taliban,"" he wrote. ""In 2013, France launched a military operation in Mali against an al-Qaeda affiliate that had overtaken large swaths of the country. And last year, France joined the U.S.-led military engagement against ISIS in Iraq and Syria."" On Saturday, Prime Minister Manuel Valls declared that France was at ""war against terrorism, against jihadism, against radical Islamism."" The attacks and the international response they have elicited evoke the days following the 9/11 attacks, Peter Feaver, a political science professor at Duke, wrote in Foreign Policy. ""This problem is best understood using the language of war,"" he wrote. ""Yes, it requires all of the tools of diplomacy, law enforcement, intelligence, and so on, but they are all components of a larger frame that is war."" Will France go to war? France has moved more and more in the direction of military force against terrorists overseas in recent years, Christopher Chivvis, associate director of the International Security and Defense Policy Center at the RAND Corporation, said via email. That's a change from a decade ago, when the nation tended to focus primarily on the domestic front in counterterrorism strategy. An important factor is recognition that the nature of the terror threat has grown increasingly complex, with links to overseas terrorist safe havens, according to Chivvis. Chivvis said the case of Mohammed Merah, who killed seven people in a series of attacks in southern France in 2012, was influential. Merah was shot dead after a long siege in Toulouse that year. Merah told police he had attended an al Qaeda training camp while visiting Afghanistan and Pakistan, according to a French prosecutor. Merah's relatives denied the claim. ""France's decision to intervene against al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb in Mali in 2013 was shaped by this growing concern about the ways that overseas terrorist safe havens increase the threat to France itself,"" Chivvis said. (""Islamic Maghreb"" refers to North Africa.) ""All of this suggests that, contrary to what might have been the case a decade ago, a French counterterrorism operation against AQAP is a real possibility."" Is a large French operation likely? You probably won't see a repeat of Mali, where France had 2,150 soldiers on the ground and 1,000 more troops supporting the operation from elsewhere. Instead, France might chose to use special operations forces, which have been working closely with the United States Special Operations Command in recent years, or even air strikes against specific targets, according to Chivvis. ""From a French perspective, airstrikes have the additional benefit of being high-profile and showcasing French airpower,"" he wrote. ""Airpower was used to great effect in Mali. French (special operations forces) performed well in Mali, however, when it came to the element of surprise and keeping the initiative against a retreating al Qaeda foe."" For France, an international and domestic response are in order. ""In both cases, France cannot go it alone, but needs allies like the United States to back it up,"" Chivvis said. ""There are always risks that such operations can backfire, and I'm sure that French leaders are doing their best to weigh those risks against the risks of not responding."" Has the military option worked? It depends on the goals, experts say. ""Has it led to the destruction of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula? No,"" Schanzer said. ""Has it prevented any 9/11-sized attacks in the United States or anywhere else in the world? The answer to that question is no as well."" The effectiveness of the military approach is hard to measure. ""Al-Awlaki has been taken off the battlefield,"" Schanzer said. ""He was a very threatening individual and, even in his death, is having influence. Some of the things that were done there have contributed and maybe helped to contain this organization but it hasn't led to its elimination."" And the rise of ISIS in Syria is instructional. ""We did think when bin Laden was killed and al Qaeda central was really strongly wounded that maybe we were on the down slope of this problem, but the civil war in Syria has really been a game changer, Schanzer told CNN. What can France do at home? In his op-ed piece, Schanzer wrote that France should revise laws to make support for foreign terrorist organizations, whether fighting or training with them, a crime punishable by a lengthy period of incarceration. ""In the United States, our 'material support for terrorism' law has been an effective tool for incapacitating potential terrorists,"" he wrote. ""The law is only triggered by specific actions taken in furtherance of terrorist organizations. If applied properly, it does not violate civil liberties by punishing people for their ideas."" Toughening criminal laws will expand the scope of surveillance against people with terrorist connections, according to Schanzer. ""Can every single person that has radical impulses be arrested and prosecuted in a democracy? No,"" he told CNN. ""But people who have known connections and have in some way interacted with foreign terrorist organizations, to me that's a crime and we should consider locking more people up. That's not a long-term response to this problem that the whole world is facing, but it is something that can reduce the immediate level of risk that they're facing."" Cherif Kouachi, 32, and Said Kouachi, 34, who authorities say carried out the Charlie Hebdo shootings, were killed during a standoff northeast of Paris last week. The brothers were French citizens known to the country's security services, according to officials. One spent time in jail for ties to terrorism, and was in Syria as recently as this summer, according to a French source. The other went to Yemen for training, officials say. Before they were killed in a shootout with French security forces, one of the brothers spoke on the phone to a journalist from the French news network BFM. ""We are just telling you that we are the defenders of Prophet Mohammed,"" he said. ""I was sent, me, Cherif Kouachi, by al Qaeda in Yemen. I went there and Sheikh Anwar Al-Awlaki financed my trip... before he was killed."" Cherif Kouachi, the younger of the brothers, was arrested by French authorities in 2005 when he was about to leave to fight in Iraq. He planned to travel to Iraq via Syria. He was sentenced to three years in prison in 2008. Schanzer wrote: ""The key steps France needs to take to address the current threat have everything to do with expanding domestic counterterrorism and little to do with the tools of war.""","France's response to Charlie Hebdo attack colored by many factors .

"(CNN) -- Not all abuse leaves physical scars, and that's a reality Jennifer Lopez is exploring in a new memoir. The actress and singer has written a book about a period of self-discovery that occurred around the time of her first world tour in 2012. While she intended for the project ""to be a fan book, a diary of the years I went on tour,"" what resulted was a book that helped the star ""face a lot,"" as she tells People magazine. One of the things she faces in her memoir are her experiences in past relationships. ""I've never gotten a black eye or a busted lip, but I've felt abused in one way or another: mentally, emotionally, verbally,"" Lopez writes in the book, titled ""True Love."" People magazine notes that the 45-year-old doesn't name her abuser, nor does she say she was physically abused. Lopez adds that she intentionally doesn't divulge details. ""I would never go into specifics about my relationships, and I don't. But the idea was that I learned something,"" she says. Lopez has tied the knot three times, with her most recent marriage, to singer Marc Anthony, ending in 2011 after seven years. Looking back on all of her past relationships, she says she's learned to ""take care of myself and know my worth."" ""When things are not working out, and you're not being treated in a way that you want to be treated, you have to look at that because it's nobody's fault but yours,"" Lopez tells People. ""You have to take control and you have to set up your own boundaries. You have the power to change it.""","Jennifer Lopez opens up about past relationships in new book .

"Bono is sorry he gave you free music. More than a month after announcing that Apple would be giving a digital copy of U2's new album, ""Songs of Innocence,"" to all 500 million iTunes customers, the group's frontman apologized to those who considered the gift an inconvenience. ""Oops!"" Bono said in a question-and-answer video the band posted on its Facebook page. His comments came in response to a question that called the automatic download ""really rude."" ""I'm sorry about that,"" Bono continued. ""I had this beautiful idea, but (we) got carried away with ourselves. Artists are prone to that kind of thing. A drop of megalomania, a touch of generosity, a dash of self-promotion and deep fear that these songs, that we poured our life into over the last few years, mightn't be heard. ""There's a lot of noise out there. I guess we got a little noisy ourselves to get through it."" The free download was announced at the September 9 Apple event at which the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus and Apple Watch were unveiled, and at which U2 performed. Instead of simply making it available, Apple automatically sent it to active iTunes accounts, and for those whose settings allowed it, the album was automatically downloaded. On social media, some customers complained that the way the album was distributed was invasive. The release also came off as tone-deaf since it happened so soon after iCloud's security was scrutinized for its part in high-profile celebrity photo hacks. Despite the complaints, the supergroup's latest was well-received by others. Apple said last week that the album had been fully downloaded 26 million times and that 81 million people had listened to at least one song. That's compared with the 14 million users who had purchased a U2 album on iTunes up until that point. In a crowded and increasingly complicated music industry, that figure still sounds like a beautiful day, even if a vocal minority of music fans still haven't found what they're looking for.","U2's Bono apologizes to iTunes users angry over free download .

"Momentum in the Senate may be building for passage of a comprehensive immigration reform bill after a border security deal was announced this week, but House GOP opposition to immigration legislation remains the biggest roadblock to a bill getting to the president's desk, and that opposition only appears to be hardening. Senate immigration deal includes tougher border security . The messy demise of the farm bill on the House floor on Thursday demonstrated the divisions within GOP ranks and the willingness of dozens of rank-and-file members to ignore their leadership.  While there's not a clear parallel between that bill's failure and the road ahead for immigration reform, the episode does underline the exceedingly tough task House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, faces as he attempts to guide immigration legislation through the House. Boehner insists he wants to tackle immigration reform, but hasn't been clear about how he intends to navigate the controversial issue through his own conference. CNN Poll: Big generational divide in immigration battle . ""After all this talk about the Senate there has been so little focus on the House and that it has been, pre-farm vote -- and will continue to be post-farm vote -- the choke point for any immigration reform, "" Amy Walter, national editor of the Cook Political Report told CNN. House GOP leaders knew many conservatives would vote against the farm bill because they viewed the food-stamp programs as too expensive.  But 62 members, roughly a quarter of all House Republicans, broke with Boehner, who made a rare endorsement of the bill, and joined with the vast majority of House Democrats to take down the bill.  Even if Democrats produced the level of support Republicans say they anticipated, GOP leaders still didn't have support within their own ranks to get the farm bill through. The farm bill's defeat ""exposed the vulnerabilities of so called compromise legislation in the House,"" Walter added. But even before the farm bill fiasco Boehner began pouring cold water on the immigration momentum coming out of the Senate.  As news was breaking on the Senate deal on Thursday morning Boehner compared immigration reform to Obamacare, the bill Republicans constantly malign as the prime example of government overreach. ""Every day as Obamacare is being implemented, Americans are reminded of what happens when you have big legislation rammed through Congress with minimum support,"" Boehner said at his weekly news conference.  ""Americans' confidence in their government is near an all-time low, so if immigration reform is going to work it's essential that we have the confidence of the American people and that it's done the right way,"" the speaker added. The deliberate move to put immigration in the same category as Obamacare showed Boehner is in no mood to muscle through a massive immigration overhaul unless it can garner significant votes from both sides of the aisle -- a tall order in the House. Boehner didn't comment directly on the new ""border surge"" provisions that would double the number of agents on the U.S.-Mexico border or the new money to construct a 700-mile-long fence.  But he raised questions on whether that plan would be enough to address concerns among conservatives, saying, ""If we're going to get the kind of bipartisan support I think we need, and we're not going to get that confidence unless the American people look up and say, 'Yes, this border security package meets the straight-face test.' "" Another key House GOP player on immigration reform, Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Virginia, was skeptical that the Senate's border security plan was going to work, telling reporters, ""Just throwing bodies at it"" does not solve the problem. Goodlatte said the larger issue is addressing the 35%-45% of the 11 million people in the U.S. without legal status who he says enter the country lawfully -- through visas, but are allowed to overstay or gain a waiver to remain.  He argued there has to be a bigger emphasis on interior enforcement programs.  And Goodlatte repeated his intention to move immigration reform through a ""step by step"" process instead of the sort of comprehensive bill the Senate is considering. Navarrette: Border security push is a joke . ""Anything attached to a path to citizenship even if it secures the border I wouldn't support it,"" Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Lou Barletta said when asked by CNN about the Senate's new border security plan.  Barletta said he could support additional resources but said he wanted ""a guarantee"" that enforcement measures in fact worked, and he thought what the Senate was doing would end up speeding up eventual citizenship for undocumented workers, something he said was unacceptable. ""I don't have any confidence that it's ever going to be implemented, "" Iowa Republican Rep. Steve King told CNN when asked about the Senate border security plan, saying he didn't believe Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano would follow the law. The dynamic inside the House Republican conference on immigration could be seen outside the Capitol on Wednesday afternoon with two groups delivering polar opposite messages about immigration policy. House GOP Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rogers, R-Washington, held a news conference with several House Republicans and a group of Hispanic religious leaders and stressed the party's outreach efforts to Latinos on immigration.  Just yards away, the loud voices of a hundreds of activists opposed to a path to citizenship -- branded ""amnesty"" -- could be heard at an event King organized. Boehner already made it clear earlier in the week that he would only move an immigration bill if it had the support of the majority of House Republicans.  But even if he gets more than half of the 234 House GOP members, he'll still needs to rely on House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi to get most of her members on board to pass a bill. Democratic support for immigration reform has never been in question.  But House Republican congressional aides, still incensed about the failure of the farm bill, question whether Democrats on Capitol Hill are more focused on scoring political points in the next election than joining with them to pass a bill. ""How are we supposed to trust a promise or a whip count from House Democrats now?"" one senior House GOP leadership aide said when asked about what the farm bill's defeat means on immigration. Walter noted that all along many Republicans on the Hill have been suspicious about how serious congressional Democrats were about actually getting an immigration bill over the finish line. ""It speaks to this deep seeded belief among many Republicans that Democrats are going to pull the rug out from them and use it to beat them about the head in 2014,"" Walter explained to CNN. The Senate could be on track to pass its immigration package before July 4, but the bipartisan group in the House that has been working for months on a similar proposal hasn't been able to finalize their deal yet. The House Judiciary Committee has begun working on more narrow proposals aimed at enforcement and security, and those could come up for votes as early as next month. Even those in the House who are pressing for major immigration reform say it's unlikely to play out in the House until later this fall. But that schedule poses difficult decisions for Boehner about how to move immigration as it comes around the same time as the House has to deal with an equally divisive issue -- addressing how to deal with the country's debt limit.

"As an Oklahoma town comes to grips with the apparent senseless killing of an Australian baseball player on its streets, one man is offering a possible motive: gang violence. James Johnson says the three boys now charged in the shooting death of Christopher Lane tried to recruit his son into a gang, then threatened to kill him if he refused. He said he thinks Lane was killed as part of a gang initiation. ""I don't think it was for fun. I don't think it was at random,"" Johnson told Australia-based Fairfax Media from his home in Duncan. D.A.: No evidence of a hate crime . The case posed questions of race early on because two of the three suspects are black and Lane was white. One of the suspects allegedly posted a message on Twitter in April saying he hated white people. Suspect tweeted: ""time to start taken life's"" District Attorney Jason Hicks acknowledged Friday the post seems racial in nature, but said the case will not be prosecuted as a hate crime. ""At this point, the evidence does not support the theory that Christopher Lane was targeted based upon his race or nationality,"" Hicks said in a statement. Duncan Mayor Gene Brown said he doesn't think Lane's killing was a hate crime, either. He told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront""  the crime is just the result of bad choices made by young people. ""I think everybody that lives here wishes it would not have happened in our community, regardless of what race"" the victim is, Brown said. ""I think that we are more concerned with just making sure that everything is taken care of for (Lane's) family and that they get all of the things that they need in order to get him home safely and take care of their loved ones."" Suspects arrested after 911 call . It was Johnson who made the call to police that resulted in the arrests of the three suspects: James Edwards, Jr., 15, Chancey Luna, 16, and Michael Jones, 17. Edwards and Luna are charged as adults with first-degree felony murder; Jones is charged with using a vehicle in the discharge of a weapon and accessory after the fact to first-degree murder. Johnson was working on his truck in a church parking lot last Friday when the three teens drove up. He had just gotten off the phone with his son, Chris, who told his father about the threat on his life. Chris lives in a house with his mother across the street from the church. It was two hours after Lane's death. Johnson, unaware of the crime, called 911 to report the teens had guns and had already threatened his son. He knew the boys -- and even mentioned Edwards by name in the call -- because the four teens had grown up together, he told Fairfax Media. Police arrived and took the three into custody. Police say Jones later told them, ""We were bored and didn't have anything to do, so we decided to kill somebody."" Opinion: Negligent parents, lawbreaking kids . Edwards' older sister, Rachel Padilla, told CNN on Thursday that her brother hung around with some older guys who were thought to be in a gang, and that other people have told her Edwards was in one -- but she said she doesn't want to believe it. Asked about it by CNN, Duncan Police Chief Danny Ford said there are no gang members in town. Brown, the mayor, said the town has been able to control gang activity. ""That's not to say that something might slip in on us, but I don't think we have a real problem with that,"" Brown told CNN. ""If we do, we definitely need to look into it."" Shock and sorrow after shooting . Richard Rhodes, a 37-year-old contractor who was working on a house near where the shooting happened, tried to save Lane's life by performing CPR, he told Fairfax Media. ""I was like this, telling him, 'Buddy, stay with us; stay with us,'"" Rhodes said, showing how he knelt next to the victim. Lane, 23, was gasping for air, and soon the gasps stopped. Rhodes and a woman together performed CPR until it became apparent that Lane had died, Fairfax reported. Lane's friends and family are being invited to a memorial game in his honor Sunday, and a donation page has been set up to raise money for a memorial fund in his name. A former student and classmate at East Central University, where Lane was studying, described him as ""a charming guy, genuinely good person, with great character and had a love for life."" ""As cliched as it sounds, Chris was the kind of guy you want your sons to grow up to be and that you want your daughters to marry. It just breaks my heart knowing how much more he could have brought to this world as a husband, father, son, brother and friend,"" Sam Malchar said.","The town's mayor says he doesn't feel it was a hate crime .
DA says the case will not be prosecuted as a hate crime .
One man says it may have been gang-related ."
"More than a week after results declared his defeat, the tea party-backed candidate in Mississippi's GOP primary for the U.S. Senate notified Sen. Thad Cochran on Thursday that he plans to challenge the outcome. State Sen. Chris McDaniel's campaign served papers to Cochran's son, Clayton, with notice of intent to challenge the results, citing allegations of improper crossover voting, according to the Clarion-Ledger of Mississippi. McDaniel's team had dispatched volunteers across the state to investigate election results in the state's 82 counties. An outside group has already filed a lawsuit in federal court. McDaniel's campaign has retained a legal team and is urging supporters to donate to the campaign legal fund. The challenge was filed with the state Republican Party executive committee, as required by law, the Clarion-Ledger reported, and an official court challenge could come as early as next week. Campaign staffers and 150 volunteers have already combed through voting records in 51 counties and claim to have identified nearly 5,000 ""irregularities,"" which are mostly tied to people who were ineligible to vote in the state's June 24 runoff election, McDaniel campaign spokesman Noel Fritsch said. The McDaniel campaign announced earlier Thursday that it is offering 15 rewards of $1,000 each for individuals who ""provide evidence leading to the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in voter fraud."" Donations to the campaign's legal coffers will help fund the rewards. McDaniel supporters called foul after Cochran's campaign and allies turned to African-Americans and other traditionally Democratic voters to help push the incumbent to victory in the primary runoff. Cochran had finished about 1,500 votes short of McDaniel in the primary three weeks earlier, but a third candidate kept McDaniel under the 50% threshold needed to win outright. Winning strategy likely to stay in Mississippi . Voters who cast a ballot in the Democratic primary on June 3 were not allowed to vote in the Republican primary runoff last week. Predicting ineligible votes, conservative groups hired former Justice Department official Christian Adams to train and oversee election observers to monitor polls and note questionable voter activity. Adams declined to comment for this story and deferred to the groups he is working with, like FreedomWorks, which he said he may represent in a potential legal challenge. FreedomWorks Executive Vice President Adam Brandon said the group's activists have been helping the McDaniel campaign review election results and will support the campaign if it moves forward with its intent to challenge -- which could come as soon as early next week. Mississippi primary spending surge pushes advertisers off the air . ""We'll ask some of our members to raise the necessary funds to fund such a challenge, and we're standing by and ready to go, period,"" Brandon said. ""It's now up to the folks in Mississippi to figure out what the next steps are."" Challenger's camp: 'irregularities' growing . The number of inadmissible votes the McDaniel camp said it discovered jumped from about 3,300 to nearly 5,000 on Wednesday after the campaign reviewed records in a dozen more counties. The irregularities fall short of Cochran's nearly 7,000-vote margin of victory, but McDaniel's campaign is confident it will hit that number after reviewing the results from the remaining third of Mississippi counties. Shortly before a bizarre turn of events Wednesday when McDaniel supporters crashed a Cochran conference call with reporters, Cochran campaign spokesman Austin Barbour called out the McDaniel camp for drawing out a divisive primary battle. ""I just think the time has come now for the McDaniel campaign to put up or shut up,"" Barbour said at a news conference Wednesday and later that . Fritsch criticized Barbour's remarks in an interview with CNN and said he hopes those are not the views of the Cochran campaign. ""I find it troublesome that Austin Barbour would call for a movement being led by the people, which is in the pursuit of truth and in the pursuit of the maintenance of electoral integrity, to shut up,"" Fritsch said. Fewer wins this time, but tea party has changed the GOP . The McDaniel campaign can only file a formal complaint after the state GOP sends certified election results to the Mississippi secretary of state, according to the state party's communications director, Bobby Morgan. The Mississippi Republican Party's executive committee and representatives from both campaigns met Tuesday, but the committee did not certify election results, Morgan said, adding that just over half of the counties had so far submitted their results. Morgan said the state party has followed the law throughout the election. ""We're looking forward to the fall campaign. We want to resolve this as soon as possible,"" he said. ""Republicans have a real legitimate chance to retake the Senate and we want to do all we can to make sure the (Mississippi) seat remains in Republican hands."" Group says requests to view records was denied . True the Vote, a conservative group, filed a lawsuit Tuesday in federal court against the Mississippi secretary of state and the executive committee of the state's Republican Party, after it analyzed electoral turnout and other data and was ""inundated"" with reports of election violations. The lawsuit alleges that voters not authorized to vote in the primary runoff may have ""diluted"" the votes of legitimate Republican voters. It demands that state election officials open up the books and defer to federal law over state statutes in disclosing election records. The group said it became suspicious after turnout rates shot up in certain precincts and its requests to view records were denied. ""We are not approaching it from a belief of who should have won the race. Let's find out what the actual final score was, and which points were legitimate and which were not on either side,"" said Carl Logan, True the Vote's communications director. ""At the end of the day we don't care who wins or loses."" Logan explained that the group gathered complaints from Mississippi voters who said they observed violations of election law. One voter complained in an e-mail to Logan that he was not asked for photo identification when he went to vote, which was required for the first time this election under Mississippi law. ""He was concerned that he could not have been the only one not to show an ID in the primary runoff,"" Logan said. He added that True the Vote will encourage voters with complaints to contact their local election officials. State party says group misunderstands the law . The nonprofit's lawsuit was joined by 13 Mississippi voters, several of whom are affiliated with the tea party. They claim that election officials denied some of their requests to view voting records or demanded ""exorbitant fees,"" Logan said. Joe Nosef, the chairman of the Mississippi Republican Party, said in a statement that True the Vote's lawsuit is based on a ""misunderstanding of both Mississippi law"" and the state party's role in the election. ""Since these allegations do not include anything the MSGOP did or is doing wrong, we will ask to be released from this lawsuit soon,"" Nosef said. The lawsuit asks for full access to unredacted Mississippi election records for the Republican primary -- which would include voters' birth dates and Social Security numbers -- to allow True the Vote to accurately verify whether illegal ballots were counted. Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School, Los Angeles, and an expert in national election law, said he believes a thorough review of election records will reveal fewer illegal votes than skeptics of the runoff claim. Levitt said that partial election records, like those reviewed by True the Vote and McDaniel supporters, can often overstate voter fraud, which is later revealed as clerical error or due to voters with identical names and birth dates -- which Levitt said is actually very common. ""It's always difficult to predict what is going to happen,"" Levitt said. ""They can give more or less of a thumbs up or down on each of the lawsuit's claims."" While the group may gain access to more election records through the lawsuit, Mississippi College law professor Matthew Steffey said it is unlikely the review of records will lead to a new election. ""I don't think showing that 1 to 2% of the electorate had some irregularity is enough,"" Steffey said. ""If it were easy to get courts to order a new election, we would have had a new vote in Florida"" during the challenge to the presidential election results in 2000. Mississippi has no provisions for election recounts. 5 controversial moments in the Mississippi election .

"European leaders Saturday held telephone talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart after a Ukrainian military plane was shot down by separatists, killing all 49 people on board, officials said. The Ilyushin-76 military transport plane went down early Saturday while approaching an airport in the eastern Ukrainian city of Luhansk, said military spokesman Vladislav Seleznyov from the anti-terror operation unit. Ukraine's defense ministry said the plane, which was transporting military personnel, was shot down by insurgents using anti-aircraft machine guns. The attack, which represents one of the bloodiest single events in that nation's current period of turmoil, spurred a diplomatic flurry to limit further escalation of the crisis. On Saturday, French President Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel held a telephone discussion with Putin on the crisis in Ukraine, according to the Elysee Palace and the Kremlin. Hollande and Merkel expressed their deep concern about the ongoing fighting in eastern Ukraine, particularly Saturday's attack, the Elysee Palace said. The French and German leaders stressed the importance of reaching a cease-fire in Ukraine and avoiding the transfer of fighters and weapons across the Ukrainian-Russian border, according to Hollande's office. The Kremlin said the three leaders also talked about the drafting of a United Nations Security Council resolution aimed at promoting a settlement. The European leaders stressed the need for an agreement on continuing Russian natural gas deliveries to Ukraine, according to the Elysee. ""Situation is dangerous, but I hope will remain under control,"" Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Danylo Lubkivsky told CNN Saturday. ""With no doubt, more pressure on Russia is needed."" In a phone conversation with Hollande, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko urged the European Union to immediately consider sanctions against Russia, including the termination of ""military-technical cooperation,"" Poroshenko's office said. Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk spoke by phone with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who expressed condolences for the loss of life and ""strong concern"" about the flow of heavy weapons and militants across the border from Russia, a senior State Department official said. Kerry also talked with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, voicing his concern over the downing of the Ukrainian transport plane and pressing Lavrov to ""make clear"" Russia's commitment to peace, a cease-fire and political dialogue, the state department official said. In a statement, Poroshenko said the army and state border service had closed 248 kilometers of Ukraine's border. ""The goal us to take back control of Ukraine over the state border and provide adequate response to terrorists,"" he said. A U.S. National Security Council spokeswoman Saturday condemned that attack, saying officials were ""deeply concerned about the situation in eastern Ukraine, including by the fact that militant and separatist groups have received heavy weapons from Russia, including tanks, which is a significant escalation."" ""Regarding sanctions, we have said that we want to give Russia the opportunity to pursue de-escalation,"" NSC spokeswoman Laura Lucas Magnuson said in the statement. ""President Obama made clear that de-escalation depends upon Russia ceasing support for separatists in eastern Ukraine and stopping the provision of arms and materiel across the border, and we urge Russia to do so."" Video posted to YouTube claimed to show the plane being shot down. Small flashes can be seen climbing skyward, followed by large flashes on the ground on the distant horizon. The plane was also carrying military machinery and supplies, the ministry said.  Officials originally had said the incident occurred late Friday but later updated the time. Poroshenko announced a day of mourning Sunday to honor those killed and said Ukrainians are grieving. ""It is a great loss not only for the families of the deceased ones, but for the whole country,"" he said. ""Everyone involved in this cynical, large-scale terrorist act will be punished."" In an indication of the continued opposition from some quarters to the Kiev government, the state security office said in a statement Saturday that a homemade bomb was found overnight outside a gate to Poroshenko's office. The device was made of grenades and a kilogram of other material, such as metal screws, and had a threatening note attached that demanded that the President stop military action against the separatists, the statement said. The person who left it was spotted but fled without detonating it. The Kiev-based government is carrying out what it calls an anti-terrorist operation, centered in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, to try to regain control from pro-Russia separatists. Russia and Ukraine have been engaged in a tense standoff since March, when Russia annexed Crimea and massed troops along its border with Ukraine. Moscow has since begun to withdraw those forces. NATO: Tank images raise questions . NATO released images Saturday that it said raised ""significant questions concerning Russia's ... involvement in the movement of military equipment from Russian territory into Ukraine."" Ukraine's acting Interior Minister Arsen Avakov claimed Thursday that three Russian tanks had crossed the border into Ukraine as part of a larger armored column, prompting a skirmish between Ukrainian and Russian forces. The vehicles entered at a checkpoint controlled by separatists in Ukraine's eastern Luhansk region, Avakov said, citing Ukrainian intelligence. The Russian Foreign Ministry told the BBC on Thursday that the claim its tanks had crossed the border was ""another fake piece of information."" But the United States also believes tanks and heavy weapons have crossed into Ukraine from Russia after moving from a deployment site in southwest Russia, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said Friday. The images released by NATO show the movements of Russian forces at a site near Russia's southwestern city of Rostov-on-Don, about 75 kilometers from a border crossing the body says is controlled by Luhansk separatists. No tanks were at the site on May 30, according to NATO. An image from June 6 shows the departure of the Russian military unit but the arrival of 8 main battle tanks. On June 11, 10 main battle tanks can be seen at the site, NATO said. Of these, three have been loaded onto the kind of low trucks ""normally used to move tanks, likely indicating imminent movement by road."" NATO also cites video posted online showing tanks on the move in Makiivka and Snizhne in eastern Ukraine, in one instance accompanied by a vehicle flying a Russian flag. ""The tanks do not bear markings or camouflage paint like those used by the Ukrainian military.  In fact, they do not have markings at all, which is reminiscent of tactics used by Russian elements that were involved in destabilizing Crimea,"" the NATO statement said. It also accused Russian officials of having been ""repeatedly misleading and evasive regarding their roles in both Crimea and eastern Ukraine."" If the latest reports are confirmed, the statement added, ""this would mark a grave escalation of the crisis in eastern Ukraine in violation of Russia's Geneva commitments."" U.S. and EU leaders have warned that additional economic sanctions could be imposed on Russia if it further escalates its incursion into Ukraine. Russian leaders in turn say Ukraine has failed to move to implement the framework for peace worked out in Geneva, Switzerland, in April. They say Ukrainian leaders have carried out a campaign of violence against people living in the largely pro-Russian east. Mariupol operation . On Friday, the Kiev government announced that an operation targeting pro-Russian separatists in the city of southeastern port city of Mariupol had been successful. Anton Geraschenko, adviser to Avakov, said more than 30 ""terrorists"" had been detained and their base destroyed. Other separatists are hiding in homes and basements for safety, he said. Four Ukrainian soldiers were injured in the operation, he said. Residents of the city may in the past have blocked Ukraine's security forces, he said, but ""today, not one resident of Mariupol protected terrorists."" According to the Interior Ministry, the yellow-and-blue Ukrainian flag is flying once again over the main municipal building in Mariupol. The city has changed hands several times in the course of hostilities over the past several months. But the unrest hasn't ended. Pro-Russian separatists wielding automatic weapons and grenades attacked Ukraine border service vehicles Saturday near the city, Ukraine's State Border Service said. Five people were killed and seven others were wounded, the service said. The self-proclaimed Republic of Lugansk took credit for the attack, service spokesman Oleg Slobodyan said Saturday. Diplomatic moves . Western leaders have accused Moscow of fomenting instability in eastern Ukraine and have urged Moscow to engage with the new leadership in Kiev. On Thursday, Poroshenko and Putin ""held a substantial and long phone conversation,"" the Ukrainian President's media office said. The leaders discussed Poroshenko's peace plan to resolve the situation in the east of Ukraine, it said. Poroshenko has called on the rebels to lay down their arms and engage in talks. Also Thursday, Vitaly Churkin, Russia's U.N. ambassador, said he would introduce a resolution on Ukraine at the U.N. Security Council in light of what he said was a deteriorating situation in the country.","NATO releases images showing tank presence near Russia's border with Ukraine .

"One of the ships that Shell Oil plans to use to drill in the Arctic slipped its mooring and drifted close to one of Alaska's Aleutian Islands, the latest in a string of incidents to arise around the controversial project. The Noble Discoverer was about 175 yards from shore in Unalaska Bay when it slipped its mooring Saturday and drifted towards shore near Dutch Harbor, Coast Guard Petty Officer Sara Francis said. ""There are no reports of injuries, pollution and damage to the Noble Discoverer,"" she said Sunday night. The incident raised concerns of a possible grounding near Dutch Harbor, though Francis said there was ""no damage to the hull or evidence it ran aground."" The Noble Discoverer is one of roughly two dozen ships that Shell is sending to the Beaufort and Chukchi seas in the Arctic to drill exploration wells in the harshest climate in the world.Opinion: The stakes are hugePete Slaiby, the vice president of Shell Oil in Alaska, told CNN recently the drilling in the arctic would be the ""most complex, most difficult wells we've drilled in company history."" Proponents say if Shell finds oil with its Arctic drilling, it could create thousands of  jobs; opponents -- Alaska's Inuit Eskimos and environmentalists -- say an oil spill could pollute the waters and damage the economy. ""Our subsistence for the winter, it all comes from the ocean, the fish and whale. It's going to ruin our ocean,"" 79-year-old Abagail Nashupuq of Point Hope told CNN recently. Nashupuq has spent her entire life in the small northwest fishing village of Point Hope, which sits about 90 miles from where Shell plans to drill one of its exploratory wells in the Chukchi Sea. Shell has been forced to postpone drilling, which was scheduled to begin this month, until August by an unexpected thick ice pack. The delay cuts valuable time from Shell, which is operating under U.S. permits which require to stop drilling in the seas by the end of October. Questions also were raised in June about the durability of one of Shell's underwater oil spill containment vessels in severe weather, which resulted in the vessel that was headed to one of the drilling sites to be temporarily held at port in Washington. Opponents, primarily the Inuit and environmentalists, called for a review of the federal air permits that were issued to Shell Oil as part of its drilling plan. Related story: Nations battle for Arctic oil and natural gas . Greenpeace, which has been leading a campaign against the drilling, issued a statement Sunday that questioned whether Shell could carry out the complicated plan if it was having problems with a ship's mooring. Shell spokesman Curtis Smith said all indications pointed to the Noble Discoverer slipping anchor in soft ground, drifting only 100 yards toward shore. ""Shell quickly engaged one of its support vessels, the Lauren Foss, which safely towed the Discoverer back to its previous location,"" he said. Francis, the petty officer, said the crew of the Noble Discoverer were interviewed. ""They did not feel any indication that the ship grounded,"" she said. The Coast Guard plans an inspection of the interior of the ship's hull on Monday, the same day that Shell will use a diver to conduct a secondary inspection of the outer hull. Smith said the anchor system used in the Arctic offshore drilling is ""no way similar to the light anchor used in the harbor scenario."" Still, Slaiby promised a full investigation. ""Even a near miss is unacceptable.  While an internal investigation will determine why the Discoverer slipped anchor, we are pleased with the speed and effectiveness of the mitigation measures we had in place,"" he said.","The Noble Discoverer slipped its mooring in Unalaska Bay, the Coast Guard says .

"(CNN) -- What do you do when you're NASA and comedian Stephen Colbert wins your contest to name the new wing for the International Space Station? You name an orbital exercise machine after him. NASA will name an orbital exercise machine after comedian Stephen Colbert. The Combined Operational Load Bearing External Resistance Treadmill, or COLBERT, is expected to keep astronauts in shape. With the help of a legion of fans, Colbert got the most votes in the space agency's online poll soliciting names for Node 3, which will be called Tranquility after the Sea of Tranquility, where Apollo 11 landed on the moon. Astronaut Sunita ""Suni"" Williams revealed NASA's decision on ""The Colbert Report,"" which aired on Comedy Central on Tuesday. ""Your name will be in space, in a very important place,"" Williams said as Colbert reacted in mock disgust to her announcement of the node's new name. ""I think a treadmill is better than a node ... because the node is just a box for the treadmill,"" Colbert deadpanned. ""Nobody says, 'Hey, my mom bought me a Nike box.' They want the shoes that are inside."" Colbert's campaign generated welcome attention for the oft-forgotten International Space Station, but it also presented a dilemma for NASA. The contest rules spelled out that NASA reserves the right to ""ultimately select a name in accordance with the best interests of the agency. ... Such name may not necessarily be one which is on the list of voted-on candidate names."" The runner-up name to Colbert was Serenity, which was more in line with the names of the other nodes. Harmony, the name given Node 2, was chosen by a poll of kindergartners in 2007. The publicity caused by Colbert's interest in Node 3 turned out well for the space agency. ""This spread overall awareness of the International Space Station,"" said Bill Gerstenmaier, NASA's associate administrator for Space Operations, who has appeared on Colbert's show. NASA changed its plan to announce the new name at the end of April at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida when Colbert's producers invited them to do it on their show, the space agency said. Pennsylvania Congressman Chaka Fattah, who stepped in the naming fray in March, when he said Colbert had won the naming contest fair and square, called the decision a good compromise. It's ""one small step for NASA and a giant step for the Colbert nation,"" the congressman said, playing off Neil Armstrong's line when he first set foot on the moon in 1969. Colbert's loyal fans have, in the past, bombarded polls to have things named after him. In 2006, Colbert out-polled every other name in a bridge-naming contest in Hungary. The country's government later said it cannot name the bridge after the comedian because he does not speak Hungarian and is not dead. Colbert also tried to get himself on Democratic and Republican primary ballots in his home state of South Carolina in 2007. The Democratic Party's executive council voted against his inclusion, and he did not qualify for the Republican primary because he missed the deadline. However, ice cream maker Ben and Jerry named a new flavor in honor of him, calling it Colbert's AmeriCone Dream. Virgin America also named one of its planes Air Colbert. CNN's Ed Payne and CNN Radio's Shelby Lin and Ninette Sosa contributed to this report.","Comedian Stephen Colbert will have space treadmill named after him .

"When China's state-owned oil company dispatched an oil rig to a contested area of the South China Sea it flicked a match on a long-smoldering dispute with its communist neighbor Vietnam. Analysts say Beijing must have known the move would elicit some reaction, but it clearly didn't predict having to evacuate thousands of Chinese nationals desperate to put some distance between them and violent Vietnamese protests. ""The whole episode seems to reek of miscalculation, perhaps by both sides, but it demonstrates how volatile how this region can be,"" said Alexander Neill, Shangri-La Dialogue Senior Fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Asia (IISS). At issue is the positioning of an oil rig in waters claimed by both China and Vietnam. Vietnam claims the rig's presence is ""illegal"" while China says it has every right to drill, and has castigated the Vietnamese government for failing to ensure the safety of its nationals. To understand the issue, it's vital to look at the exact position of the rig. Where is the rig? In early May, Beijing announced the HD-981 rig would be parked at sea for exploratory work until mid-August. Owned by the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), the rig is anchored in Lot 143, about 120 nautical miles east of Vietnam's Ly Son Island and 180 nautical miles from China's Hainan Island, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). Analysis co-authored by CSIS experts said China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs appears to be basing its right to be there on the assumption that one of the Paracel Islands, which it claims as its own, is 17 miles north, allowing it to claim its own continental shelf in the region. China calls the contested Paracel Islands the Xisha Islands, while in Vietnam they're known as the Hoang Sa Islands. Vietnam says the rig site is clearly on its continental shelf, and moreover is in its Exclusive Economic Zone. Hanoi has demanded that China remove the offending rig, escort vessels from the region and hold talks to settle the issue. The Chinese rig was escorted to the region by naval vessels and fighter jets, drawing Vietnamese boats to the area and raising tensions at sea. The Vietnamese have accused Chinese vessels of ramming and blasting its boats with water cannon. The Chinese say any conflict was provoked by Vietnamese harassment. Clashes on land . Miles away from the standoff at sea, violent protests have erupted at Chinese and Taiwanese owned or operated factories, mainly in the provinces of Ha Tinh and Binh Duoung. Protesters smashed down gates and set fire to businesses, attacking anything deemed to be of Chinese origin, including its nationals. On Sunday, China chartered flights to evacuate 290 citizens, including 100 injured in the most recent violence. Video aired by state broadcaster CCTV showed some limping or being carried down the stairs of a medical flight arriving in the city of Chengdu, many with limbs bandaged. Two Chinese nationals were killed in earlier clashes, authorities said. Around 7,000 Chinese nationals had boarded ships or were due to do so this week, state news agency Xinhua reported.  An outraged opinion piece published on the same site said the protests by ""irrational rioters"" would in no way strengthen Hanoi's ""groundless claim over Chinese territory and surrounding waters in the South China Sea."" Who is right? While many commentators say Vietnam has every right to feel appalled over the positioning of the Chinese rig, at least one analyst says the issue not as clear cut as some suggest. ""Geographical proximity alone is not an unequivocal basis for claiming sovereignty or sovereign rights,"" writes Sam Bateman in the Eurasia Review. Bateman, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS) at Nanyang Technological University, says Vietnam's claim to the Paracel Islands is ""seriously weakened"" by North Vietnam's recognition of China's sovereignty over the Paracels and lack of protest between 1958 and 1975. In 1974, the two countries fought the Battle of the Paracel Islands, which ended in a Chinese victory and complete control over the land and surrounding waters. After the reunification of Vietnam in 1975, Vietnam's leaders publicly renewed the country's claim to the islands but the issue remains unresolved. In January this year, activists shouted anti-China slogans and laid flowers for more than 70 Vietnamese soldiers killed in the conflict, 40 years on. What is motivating China? On the surface, oil would seem to be the reason China has waded into the disputed area but analysts say politics are clearly at play. ""This kind of a move by putting an oil rig in this sort of place, you could say it's a carte blanche to allow China to enhance its naval operations in the region and to project its power further out into the South China Sea,"" Neill said. It's not the first time China has stepped on regional sensitivities by making high profile and deliberate incursions into contested tracts. There have been tense encounters between Japan and China over the Senkaku or Diaoyu Islands in recent years, and China has locked horns with the Philippines over competing claims to the Scarborough Shoal. In a statement released May 7, the U.S. State Department characterized China's latest move as a ""part of a broader pattern of Chinese behavior to advance its claims over disputed territory in a manner that undermines peace and stability in the region."" What's the response from China? The ferocity of the Vietnamese protests appears to have taken China by surprise and it's clearly expressed its dissatisfaction with Vietnam's handling of the unrest. On May 18, China announced it was suspending some of its plans for bilateral exchanges with the country. It's warned its citizens that Vietnam is not safe for travel, while the Global Times reported many Chinese travel agencies had suspended tours to Vietnam. China has also warned of other unspecified punishment, hinting that it will use its economic leverage. Trade between China and Vietnam reached more than 50 billion dollars in 2013 according to Chinese state media and Vietnam depends heavily on foreign investment. Commentary carried by China's state-run Xinhua news agency suggested: ""It is advisable for the Vietnamese government to think of the bigger picture and not to get stuck in extreme nationalism so as to avoid escalation of violence and complication of the situation in the South China Sea. ""By immediately stopping the violence and any further provocations, Vietnam can work with China to tap the full potential of their economic cooperation in such areas as financial services and industry transfer."" How has Vietnam responded? While maintaining its demands for China to leave the contested area, the Vietnamese government says it's taken steps to dampen further protests. It has characterized the protests as ""spontaneous acts"" by individuals who are exploiting the situation to ""cause social disorder."" Hundreds of people have been arrested and the government has reassured foreign investors that it attaches a ""special importance"" to ensuring their safety. How is this likely to end? Alexander Neill from IISS predicts relations between the two will be strained for some time, but trade ties between the countries are likely to offer a way forward. ""I think there's a common misperception that the party-to-party relationship, the two communist parties in China and Vietnam, have this deep and understanding relationship. I don't think that's necessarily true. I think to a large extent this relationship is cosmetic,"" he said. ""The real business of the relationship is in trade so that might be an area where there could be a way out, or channels of communication could speak more than political acrimony. ""The Vietnamese authorities can't afford to lose very significant chunks of investment into their economy."" Read more: Chinese ships reach Vietnam to evacuate citizens .

"A flesh-eating drug that turns people into zombie-like creatures seems to have made its way to the United States. This extremely addictive injectable opioid is called krokodil (pronounced like crocodile) or desomorphine. It's so named in part because users report black or green scaly skin as a side effect. This weekend five people were hospitalized in the Chicago suburb of Joliet, Illinois, with symptoms similar to cases reported recently by health care providers in Arizona and Oklahoma. Dr. Abhin Singla said he suspects a woman he treated this weekend was suffering from krokodil addiction. Singla is an internist and addiction specialist at Joliet's Presence St. Joseph Medical Center. The patient lost significant portions of her legs, he said. ""It's a zombie drug -- it literally kills you from the inside out,"" Singla said. ""If you want way to die, this is a way to die."" Opinion: Drug prohibition is a global folly . Krokodil causes serious damage to the veins and soft tissue infections, rapidly followed by gangrene and necrosis, according to a 2013 study (PDF). The soft tissue damage happens around the injection site. The drug also seems to clump in the veins as it fails to dissolve completely in the blood. The clumps make their way to distant places in the body and start to damage tissue, said Dr. Robert Geller, medical director of the Georgia Poison Center. Geller said he hopes the drug ""doesn't show its ugly face"" in Georgia but said doctors across the country are aware of the drug. So far there are no officially confirmed American cases of krokodil abuse. To have official confirmation, the Drug Enforcement Administration would need to have a sample of the drug that caused the problem. A DEA fact sheet about the drug released this month said the National Forensic Laboratory Information System, the DEA database that collects scientifically verified data on drug items and cases, identified two exhibits submitted to these labs as desomorphine in 2004 but none since then. ""It's not clear how widely used it is in the U.S.,"" Geller said. FDA fights drug overdoses with new labels for prescription . CNN affiliate KOCO-TV in Oklahoma City spoke with a woman who said her best friend from Duncan, Oklahoma, died after using krokodil last year. ""The doctors say it ate him from the inside out,"" Chelle Fancher told the TV station. ""It wasn't until the next day that they told us that it was krokodil."" But Mark Woodward, a spokesman for the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics, said krokodil was ruled out in the Duncan case through an autopsy. ""We watched the reports carefully to see if it was here,"" he said. ""It was just a drug overdose, and nothing in the system consistent with krokodil."" There have been many confirmed cases of krokodil abuse in Russia and Ukraine. An estimated 100,000 in Russia and around 20,000 people in Ukraine are estimated to have injected the drug in 2011, according to a study that ran in the International Journal of Drug Policy this year. Experts theorize the drug first spread across Russia and Ukraine when heroin became less available. Krokodil is cheaper than heroin and can be easily cooked up in someone's home much like meth. People making krokodil combine the painkiller codeine with easily available chemicals. They can use iodine; strong alkalies such as Mr. Muscle, a kitchen and bathroom cleaner; hydrochloric acid; red phosphorous from matches; and/or organic solvents such as gasoline or paint thinner, according to the study. Mortality rates are high among users, according to the study. Regular marijuana use on the rise . In Russia, users frequently are young people with relatively short drug histories, the study found. Medical help is often only sought after users are in the late stages of their addiction and end up with severe mutilations, rotting gums, bone infections, decayed structure of the jaw and facial bones, sores and ulcers on the forehead and skull as well as rotting ears, noses and lips and liver and kidney problems. ""This may be an inexpensive high compared to other drugs, according to its reputation, (but it) is more likely to cause withdrawal symptoms and be a real problem for users,"" Geller said. ""My advice is to would-be users, 'Don't.' This is a risky way to try and get high."" The short half-life of the drug means a user's attention is narrowed to the ""process of acquiring and preparing and administering the drug, leaving little time for matters other than avoiding withdrawal and chasing (the) high,"" according to one medical study, hence its reputation for creating ""zombies."" Binges on the drug reportedly last over several days. During the binge, a user can show irrational behavior and experience sleep deprivation and exhaustion, memory loss and speech problems. According to the Joliet hospital, the five people brought in who may have used krokodil said they thought they were buying heroin. ""I think it's the tip of the iceberg; I think it's going to get a lot worse before it gets better,"" said Singla, the addiction specialist. ""I think if it stays on the market long enough, you're going to have people who are desperate addicts that can't support their heroin habit but can utilize this drug, not really caring about the consequences, and get the same high for a third of the price."" There's something (potentially dangerous) about molly .","Krokodil is an extremely addictive injectable opioid .

"(CNN)Although most of us worry about other things, climate scientists have become increasingly worried about the survival of civilization. For example, Lonnie Thompson, who received the U.S. National Medal of Science in 2010, said that virtually all climatologists ""are now convinced that global warming poses a clear and present danger to civilization."" Informed journalists share this concern. The climate crisis ""threatens the survival of our civilization,"" said Pulitzer Prize-winner Ross Gelbspan. Mark Hertsgaard agrees, saying that the continuation of global warming ""would create planetary conditions all but certain to end civilization as we know it."" These scientists and journalists, moreover, are worried not only about the distant future but about the condition of the planet for their own children and grandchildren. James Hansen, often considered the world's leading climate scientist, entitled his book ""Storms of My Grandchildren."" The threat to civilization comes primarily from the increase of the level of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere, due largely to the burning of fossil fuels. Before the rise of the industrial age, CO2 constituted only 275 ppm (parts per million) of the atmosphere. But it is now above 400 and rising about 2.5 ppm per year. Because of the CO2 increase, the planet's average temperature has increased 0.85 degrees Celsius (1.5 degrees Fahrenheit). Although this increase may not seem much, it has already brought about serious changes. The idea that we will be safe from ""dangerous climate change"" if we do not exceed a temperature rise of 2C (3.6F) has been widely accepted. But many informed people have rejected this assumption. In the opinion of journalist-turned-activist Bill McKibben, ""the one degree we've raised the temperature already has melted the Arctic, so we're fools to find out what two will do."" His warning is supported by James Hansen, who declared that ""a target of two degrees (Celsius) is actually a prescription for long-term disaster."" The burning of coal, oil, and natural gas has made the planet warmer than it had been since the rise of civilization 10,000 years ago. Civilization was made possible by the emergence about 12,000 years ago of the ""Holocene"" epoch, which turned out to be the Goldilocks zone - not too hot, not too cold. But now, says physicist Stefan Rahmstorf, ""We are catapulting ourselves way out of the Holocene."" This catapult is dangerous, because we have no evidence civilization can long survive with significantly higher temperatures. And yet, the world is on a trajectory that would lead to an increase of 4C (7F) in this century. In the opinion of many scientists and the World Bank, this could happen as early as the 2060s. What would ""a 4C world"" be like? According to Kevin Anderson of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research (at the University of East Anglia), ""during New York's summer heat waves the warmest days would be around 10-12C (18-21.6F) hotter [than today's]."" Moreover, he has said, above an increase of 4C only about 10% of the human population will survive. Believe it or not, some scientists consider Anderson overly optimistic. The main reason for pessimism is the fear that the planet's temperature may be close to a tipping point that would initiate a ""low-end runaway greenhouse,"" involving ""out-of-control amplifying feedbacks."" This condition would result, says Hansen, if all fossil fuels are burned (which is the intention of all fossil-fuel corporations and many governments). This result ""would make most of the planet uninhabitable by humans."" Moreover, many scientists believe that runaway global warming could occur much more quickly, because the rising temperature caused by CO2 could release massive amounts of methane (CH4), which is, during its first 20 years, 86 times more powerful than CO2. Warmer weather induces this release from carbon that has been stored in methane hydrates, in which enormous amounts of carbon -- four times as much as that emitted from fossil fuels since 1850 -- has been frozen in the Arctic's permafrost. And yet now the Arctic's temperature is warmer than it had been for 120,000 years -- in other words, more than 10 times longer than civilization has existed. According to Joe Romm, a physicist who created the Climate Progress website, methane release from thawing permafrost in the Arctic ""is the most dangerous amplifying feedback in the entire carbon cycle."" The amplifying feedback works like this: The warmer temperature releases millions of tons of methane, which then further raise the temperature, which in turn releases more methane. The resulting threat of runaway global warming may not be merely theoretical. Scientists have long been convinced that methane was central to the fastest period of global warming in geological history, which occurred 55 million years ago.  Now a group of scientists have accumulated evidence that methane was also central to the greatest extinction of life thus far: the end-Permian extinction about 252 million years ago. Worse yet, whereas it was previously thought that significant amounts of permafrost would not melt, releasing its methane, until the planet's temperature has risen several degrees Celsius, recent studies indicate that a rise of 1.5 degrees would be enough to start the melting. What can be done then? Given the failure of political leaders to deal with the CO2 problem, it is now too late to prevent terrible developments. But it may -- just may -- be possible to keep global warming from bringing about the destruction of civilization. To have a chance, we must, as Hansen says, do everything possible to ""keep climate close to the Holocene range"" -- which means, mobilize the whole world to replace dirty energy with clean as soon as possible.","Scientists and journalists are worried about the condition of the planet for their own children and grandchildren, writes David Ray Griffin .

"Can the world get enough vertical drop views over familiar destinations? It seems not. After the Grand Canyon, Chicago's Willis Tower and, more recently, the Eiffel Tower in Paris installed glass walkways offering vertigo-inducing perspectives, London has followed suit. The city's Tower Bridge, a 120-year-old crossing over the River Thames, is the latest structure to join the club with a see-through walkway that allows visitors to gaze down from 42 meters (138 feet). The walkway, the first structural alteration to the bridge since 1980s, passes over the west side of the bridge. A second walkway on the east side is to open December 1. During construction, it was known as the ""wow project"" -- and with good reason. Visitors to the attraction can look down to see London's red buses and black cabs zip beneath their feet or gaze at the bridge's impressive steel latticework. There are also spectacular views over the city's skyline. If they're lucky, or plan in advance, visitors will also get to watch the bridge being raised to allow tall shipping to pass beneath.","New glass walkway offers views from 42 meters above London's River Thames .

""But it will come, because I feel myself getting sicker. It's happening each week."" Maynard says she has stage IV glioblastoma multiforme, an aggressive form of terminal brain cancer. In April, she says, doctors gave her six months to live. The 29-year-old Oregon woman's story spread rapidly on social media after she revealed her plans to take medication to end her life. A video explaining her choice has garnered more than 8.8 million views on YouTube. And she's become a prominent spokeswoman for the ""death with dignity"" movement, which advocates that terminally ill patients be allowed to receive medication that will let them die on their own terms. She's also become a lightning rod for criticism from people who oppose that approach. In her latest statement, a nearly six-minute video produced and released by end-of-life choice advocacy group Compassion & Choices, Maynard acknowledges that some have been skeptical about her story. ""When people criticize me for not waiting longer, or, you know, whatever they've decided is best for me, it hurts,"" she says, ""because really, I risk it every day, every day that I wake up."" Compassion & Choices spokesman Sean Crowley declined CNN's request to speak with Maynard's doctors, saying they ""prefer to remain anonymous for now because opponents of death with dignity sometimes harass doctors who write aid-in-dying prescriptions."" Maynard says her health has been getting worse. She describes a recent ""terrifying"" day when she had two seizures and found herself unable to say her husband's name. ""I think sometimes people look at me and they think. 'Well you don't look as sick as you say you are,' which hurts to hear, because when I'm having a seizure and I can't speak afterwards, I certainly feel as sick as I am,"" she says, her voice cracking as she tears up. When she first started speaking out about her decision, Maynard said she planned to take the medication she'd been prescribed in early November. In her latest video, she says she's still waiting to see how her symptoms progress before deciding on a date. But taking too long to make that choice is now one of her greatest fears, Maynard says in the video. ""The worst thing that could happen to me is that I wait too long because I'm trying to seize each day,"" she says, ""but I somehow have my autonomy taken away from me by my disease because of the nature of my cancer."" National campaign . Compassion & Choices says the latest video, which was recorded on October 13 and 14, is part of a campaign ""to expand access to death with dignity in California and other states nationwide."" Maynard was living in California when doctors diagnosed her with brain cancer. ""We had to uproot from California to Oregon, because Oregon is one of only five states where death with dignity is authorized,"" she said in an opinion column she wrote for CNN earlier this month. Oregon, Washington and Vermont have ""death with dignity"" laws that allow terminally ill, mentally competent residents to voluntarily request and receive prescription drugs to hasten their death. Judicial decisions in Montana and New Mexico authorize doctors to prescribe fatal drug doses in such circumstances, although the rulings haven't become state law. Now, changing that has become part of Maynard's mission. ""My goal, of course, is to influence this policy for positive change. And I would like to see all Americans have access to the same health care rights,"" she says in her latest video. But she says she's also focused on simpler goals. ""They mostly do boil down to my family and friends and making sure they all know how important they are to me and how much I love them,"" she says. Family supports her decision . The video also includes statements from Maynard's family. Her mother, Debbie Ziegler, says she supports her daughter. ""It's not my job to tell her how to live, and it's not my job to tell her how to die,"" she says. ""It's my job to love her through it."" Her husband, Dan Diaz, says they're taking things day by day. ""That's the only way to get through this. You take away all of the material stuff, all the nonsense that we all seem to latch onto as a society,"" he says, ""and you realize that those moments are really what matter."" Last week, Maynard visited the Grand Canyon -- a trip she described as the last item on her bucket list. Photos on her website showed her and her husband standing on the edge of the canyon, hugging and kissing. In the video, Maynard says she's hoping her mother and husband will be able to bounce back after her death. ""I understand everyone needs to grieve, but I want him to be happy, so I want him to have a family,"" she says. ""And I know that might sound weird, but there's no part of me that wants him to live out the rest of his life just missing his wife, so I hope he moves on and becomes a father."" Debate over 'death with dignity' The so-called ""death with dignity"" movement is opposed by many religious and right-to-life groups, which consider it assisted suicide. And Maynard's decision has drawn criticism from some religious leaders. ""We believe she's made in the image of God, we believe that God determined when she would be born and God should determine when she's going to die,"" Dave Watson, pastor of Calvary Chapel of Staten Island, told CNN's Brooke Baldwin earlier this month. ""I certainly sympathize. And when I read the story, I prayed for the woman and her family. I can't imagine the agony for a decision like this. But I don't think that necessarily we're saying the right things about death."" What if Maynard had showed a gun in her video, instead of a pill bottle, he asked. Philip Johnson, a Catholic seminarian who says he was also diagnosed with incurable brain cancer, criticized Maynard's choice. ""A diagnosis of terminal cancer uproots one's whole life, and the decision to pursue physician-assisted suicide seeks to grasp at an ounce of control in the midst of turmoil,"" he wrote in a column posted on the Catholic Diocese of Raleigh's website. ""It is an understandable temptation to take this course of action, but that is all that it is -- a temptation to avoid an important reality of life."" But polls have shown that most Americans support having a say in how they die, especially if the process is described not as doctors helping a patient ""commit suicide"" but as ending a patient's life ""by some painless means."" ""I think there is something of a movement here,"" Arthur Caplan, professor of bioethics at NYU's Langone Medical Center, told CNN's Don Lemon earlier this month. ""When you push Americans to say, 'Do you want choice on this matter?' I think a lot of them are going to say yes."" Caplan said Maynard's first video speaking out about her decision raised some concerns. ""I wouldn't want her to feel pressure that she had to do it because she just told us all she was going to,"" he said. Maynard has stressed that she isn't suicidal. ""If all my dreams came true, I would somehow survive this,"" she says in her latest video, ""but most likely, I won't.""","Brittany Maynard says she has terminal brain cancer .

"It is 10 years after the invasion of Iraq, and images of Iraqi women from various political parties are filling the streets of Baghdad ahead of April's local elections -- a sign to casual observers that women's equality is on track in this war-ravaged country. But although the women of Iraq have obtained some benefits on paper, the reality is that they have lost far more than they have gained since the war began in 2003. On the political front, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki has not appointed a single woman to a senior cabinet position, despite the fact women are guaranteed 25% of the seats in parliament by the constitution. The Ministry of Women's Affairs, a poorly-funded and mostly ceremonial department, is the lone ministry headed up by a woman. FULL COVERAGE: The Iraq War, 10 years on . Constitutionally, women were able to secure the ability to pass their citizenship on to their children by non-Iraqi husbands, making Iraq one of a handful Arab countries with such a provision for their female citizens. But on the other hand, women are no longer guaranteed equal treatment under one law in terms of marriage, divorce, inheritance and custody. That law, the Family Statutes Law, has been replaced one giving religious and tribal leaders the power to regulate family affairs in the areas they rule in accordance with their interpretation of religious laws. This not only is making women more vulnerable, it is giving women from various sects (Sunni or Shia) or religion (Muslim or Christian) different legal treatments on the same issues. EXCLUSIVE: Hans Blix on 'terrible mistake' in Iraq . Economically, women have gone from being visibly active in the Iraqi work force in the 1980s -- particularly in the farming, marketing and professional services sectors -- to being nearly non-existent in 2013. The women who could afford it withdrew from the public space due the violence dominating  the streets. 10 years ago Iraq produced much of its own food and had a productive industrial sector -- but now Iraq imports practically all of its food, and farmers and factory workers simply found themselves out of a job as industry ground to a halt. And while both women and men suffered as a result, the impact on women was greater due to their limited mobility in the face of poor security. ARWA DAMON: Iraq suffocates in cloak of sorrow . Violence against women -- and the lack of legal protection for women -- is also on the rise.  Women's rights groups blame the increase in violence on the social and economic pressure that families face, the lack of public and political will to stop it, and the increase religious conservatism that often justifies the violence. The saddest part of the story is the lost memory of what Iraqi women once were. I grew up in Baghdad with a working mother who drove herself to the office and always told me that I could anything I wanted with my life. My mother's friends were factory managers, artists, principals and doctors. It has been just over 20 years since I left Iraq. Today, female college students ask me if it is true that the streets of Baghdad were once full of women driving, that women could walk around in public at all times of the day without worry, that university campuses were once filled with women who did not wearing headscarves. It would be unfair to blame the regression Iraqi women have faced only on the last 10 years, as the previous decade of economic sanctions that preceded it also took its toll on Iraqi society. But it is necessary to observe -- especially in light of all the changes that are happening in post-Arab Spring countries -- that female political participation in a country's democratic process cannot be the end of the story.  Women's active economic and social engagement is just as crucial to society as it is to their own wellbeing. America entered Iraq in 2003 with lots of promises, but women's rights were not even on the radar screen. Ten years later, Iraqi women find themselves the subjects of a story that does not have a happy ending. But despite the challenges that face them, some Iraqi women continue to stand up for women's rights. They deserve everyone's support, for the story of women's rights is the story of Iraq's future.","Iraqi women have lost more than they've gained since Iraq War began in 2003 .

"(CNN)The battle for a key Syrian city on the Turkish border intensified Monday as ISIS continued its push for control of Kobani while also scoring a victory in neighboring Iraq, taking a strategically important military base in Anbar province. A fighter from the Kurdish People's Protection Unit, or YPG, told CNN's Arwa Damon that the battle in Kobani concerned the main border crossing into Turkey. If ISIS took control, he said, ""it's over."" The fighter said the Kurdish fighters had pushed back an attempted advance by ISIS on Monday morning but that it would be ""impossible"" for them to hold their ground if current conditions continued. Should they take Kobani, the militants would control three official border crossings between Turkey and Syria and a stretch of the border about 60 miles (97 kilometers) long. Monday has been one of the most violent days in Kobani since ISIS launched its assault on the Syrian city, with sounds of fierce fighting, including gunfire and explosions, CNN staff on the Syria-Turkey border said. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh described seeing a mushroom cloud rising about 100 meters (nearly 330 feet) above the city in an area targeted by at least four blasts, generally after the sound of jets overhead. ""However, it remains unclear who is gaining the upper hand,"" Walsh said. ""Distribution of the airstrikes does not immediately suggest the Kurds are retaking the center so far."" The U.S. military said it and its partners had attacked ISIS on Sunday and Monday, launching four airstrikes southwest of Kobani, three northeast of the city and one northwest of Raqqa, Syria. ""Fighter aircraft from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia participated in these airstrikes. All aircraft exited the strike areas safely,"" the military said in a statement. U.S. national security adviser Susan Rice said Sunday that Turkey had agreed to allow the United States and its partners to use bases and territory to train. ""They have said that their facilities inside Turkey can be used by coalition forces, American and otherwise, to engage in activities inside Iraq and Syria,"" Rice told NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""That's a new commitment and one that we very much welcome,"" she said. However, Turkey's semiofficial Anadolu Agency quoted the country's foreign minister as saying Monday: ""Turkey has not made any decision on whether to open its Incirlik airbase"" to coalition forces in the fight against the militant group. Iraqi forces abandon base . Despite airstrikes by the United States and its allies in Iraq over the weekend, reports suggest ISIS has continued to gain ground in Anbar province and has encircled Haditha, the province's last large town not yet under its control. Provincial security force sources told CNN on Monday that Iraqi forces had abandoned a strategically important base in Anbar after heavy fighting with the militants. The base outside Hit was one of the Shiite-led government's few remaining military outposts in Anbar, a predominantly Sunni province. It is a key control point for roads running through the region. The Iraqi military still controls the Ayn al-Asad military base, which helps defend Iraq's second-largest dam and the provincial capital of Ramadi. About 80% of Anbar is under ISIS control, according to Sabah Al-Karhout, president of the Anbar Provincial Council. The group's presence has been bolstered by as many as 10,000 fighters, dispatched from Syria and northern Iraq, the provincial council said. Anbar is about the size of North Dakota. On Sunday, the leader of U.S. military efforts to fight ISIS in Iraq said the terror group came within 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) of Baghdad's airport. From Baghdad area to Raqqa, Syria . Should all of Anbar fall, the Sunni extremists would rule from the perimeter of Iraq's capital to Raqqa in Syria, at least, according to the deputy head of the provincial council, Falleh al-Issawi. ISIS would control a swath 350 miles (563 kilometers) long. Anbar leaders on Saturday appealed for U.S. ground forces to help them fight ISIS, but Baghdad said it had not received any official request. The Iraqi government has been adamant that it does not want U.S. forces on the ground, and President Barack Obama has not shown any intent to deploy any. In new violence Monday evening, three explosions rocked three predominantly Shiite neighborhoods in Baghdad, killing at least 17 people and injuring 59 others, security and medical sources told CNN. In the first, an improvised explosive device detonated in Sadr City, killing six people and wounding 24. A suicide attack at the entrance to the Khadimiya neighborhood in northern Baghdad left nine dead and 29 injured. In a third blast, a car bomb attack in northern Baghdad killed two people and wounded six others. Also Monday, a motorcycle with explosives was detonated  in front of a restaurant in Kirkuk. One civilian and two police officers died in the explosion in the northern Iraqi city's Al-Qadissia section, said two government officials who could not be named for security reasons. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the explosion. CNN's Kareem Khadder contributed to this report.","Three separate blasts in Baghdad kill at least 17 people, sources say .

"A newlywed woman died after plunging about 2,000 feet in a BASE jumping attempt in Utah's rugged Zion National Park, authorities said Sunday. Amber Bellows, 28, and her husband of two weeks, Clayton Butler, climbed up Mount Kinesava, a 7,276-foot peak that overlooks the park, on Saturday, the National Park Service said. The Salt Lake City couple were said to be experienced BASE jumpers -- in which participants leap from fixed objects, such as mountains or buildings, using parachutes to slow their falls. The risky activity is illegal inside Zion National Park, authorities said. Bellows jumped first on Saturday afternoon, but her parachute didn't open properly, Butler told authorities. He said he jumped after her, but he couldn't reach her. Butler, 29, then hiked out of the remote area to find help, alerting park authorities at about 6:30 p.m. Recovery teams located Bellows' body around 10 a.m. Sunday. Using a helicopter, they hoisted her from the difficult terrain to a nearby ambulance, the Park Service said. ""Both Clayton and Amber are conscientious, experienced BASE jumpers and this was a tragic accident,"" Joshua Lloyd, her manager and videographer, said Monday. ""Amber will be missed throughout the entire community and we ask for privacy and respect for the family at this time."" Lloyd said he'd been told her jump looked fine at first, but her main parachute didn't deploy properly. Her death, the first of a BASE jumper in the park, is under investigation, authorities said. ""It is just really sad, and our condolences go out to her family and friends,"" said Jim Milestone, the acting superintendent of the park. ""BASE jumping is so dangerous,"" Milestone said in a statement. ""Even for those that are experienced, like Amber Bellows. That is one of the reasons it is not allowed in the park.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Iran halted work toward a nuclear weapon under international scrutiny in 2003 and is unlikely to be able to produce enough enriched uranium for a bomb until 2010 to 2015, a U.S. intelligence report says. A file satellite image shows Iranian nuclear facilities. A declassified summary of the latest National Intelligence Estimate found with ""high confidence"" that the Islamic republic stopped an effort to develop nuclear weapons in the fall of 2003. The estimate is less severe than a 2005 report that judged the Iranian leadership was ""determined to develop nuclear weapons despite its international obligations and international pressure."" But the latest report says Iran -- which declared its ability to produce enriched uranium for a civilian energy program in 2006 -- could reverse that decision and eventually produce a nuclear weapon if it wanted to do so. Enriched uranium at low concentrations can be used to fuel nuclear power plants, but much higher concentrations are needed to yield a nuclear explosion. ""We judge with moderate confidence that the earliest possible date Iran would be technically capable of producing enough highly enriched uranium for a weapon is late 2009, but that this is very unlikely,"" the report says. A more likely time frame for that production is between 2010 and 2015, it concludes.  Watch what new report says about Iran's nuclear ambitions » . Iran has insisted its nuclear program is strictly aimed at producing electricity, and the country has refused the U.N. Security Council's demand to halt its enrichment program. Monday's report represents the consensus of U.S. intelligence agencies. It suggests that a combination of ""threats of intensified international scrutiny and pressures, along with opportunities for Iran to achieve its security, prestige and goals for regional influence in other ways,"" could persuade the Iranian leadership to continue its suspension of nuclear weapons research. Available intelligence suggests the Iranian leadership is guided ""by a cost-benefit approach,"" not a headlong rush to develop a bomb, the report concludes. U.S. National Security adviser Stephen Hadley expressed hope after Monday's announcement, but he said Iran remains a serious threat. ""We have good reason to continue to be concerned about Iran developing a nuclear weapon even after this most recent National Intelligence Estimate,"" he told reporters at the White House. ""In the words of the NIE, quote, Iranian entities are continuing to develop a range of technical capabilities that could be applied to producing nuclear weapons if a decision is made to do so."" He said technology being developed for Iran's civilian nuclear power program could be used to enrich uranium for use in weapons, and that Iran is continuing to develop ballistic missiles. Hadley said the intelligence community came to the new conclusions on Tuesday, based on information gathered over the past few months, and President Bush was briefed about them on Wednesday. He said U.S. policy toward Iran has not changed because of the new report. ""If we want to avoid a situation where we either have to accept Iran ... with a path to a nuclear weapon, or the possibility of having to use force to stop it, with all the connotations of World War III -- then we need to step up the diplomacy, step up the pressure, to get Iran to stop their so-called civilian uranium enrichment program,"" he said. ""That's our policy going forward -- no change."" Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, welcomed the news. ""The key judgments show that the intelligence community has learned its lessons from the Iraq debacle,"" the West Virginia Democrat said in a statement.  ""It has issued judgments that break sharply with its own previous assessments, and they reflect a real difference from the views espoused by top administration officials. ""This demonstrates a new willingness to question assumptions internally, and a level of independence from political leadership that was lacking in the recent past."" Sen. Joe Biden, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the fact that Iran was several years away from nuclear weapons capability meant ""the international community has a significant window of opportunity in which to act to avoid the stark choice between going to war or accepting a nuclear Iran."" ""But the Bush administration has long lacked a comprehensive strategy to take advantage of this window,"" the Delaware Democrat and Democratic presidential hopeful said in a statement.  ""Instead of continuing its obsession with regime change and irresponsible talk of 'World War III,' we need a policy that focuses on conduct change."" The International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog, has reported that Iran is cooperating with inspectors by providing access to declared nuclear material, documents and facilities. However, the agency also said Iran is withholding information in other areas, and as a result, the IAEA's knowledge about the status of the program is ""diminishing."" Iran says its uranium enrichment work is allowed under the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty. The U.N. Security Council has passed two rounds of sanctions against Tehran, but Washington missed its goal of reaching consensus on tighter restrictions by the end of November, the State Department said last week. The report comes amid widespread accusations that the Bush administration is attempting to maneuver the United States into a conflict with Iran, which it accuses of meddling in the war in Iraq. In October, the United States designated elements of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps as supporters of terrorism. NIEs examine current capabilities and vulnerabilities and, perhaps more importantly, consider future developments. Policymakers usually request the estimates, but the intelligence community also can initiate them. E-mail to a friend .","White House says new report doesn't change U.S. policy toward Iran .

"Russia will buy Ukrainian debt and slash the price Kiev pays for its gas, President Vladimir Putin says, throwing an economic lifeline to its neighbor, rattled by protests calling for closer economic ties with Europe instead. Amid a backdrop of continuous demonstrations in Kiev, Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych met Putin in Moscow on Tuesday, where the deal was announced. There, he said they agreed on a joint economic plan of action, covering areas such as industry, agriculture, defense, construction and transport. ""We need to continue our joint work of our governments, our working groups,"" Yanukovych said in a televised news conference. Under the deal, Putin said Moscow would buy $15 billion in Ukrainian debt by investing in its national welfare fund. The cost of Russian gas supplied to Ukraine was cut from more than $400 per 1,000 cubic meters to $268.50. The deal may inflame the tens of thousands of protesters, who have poured into the streets of the Ukrainian capital for weeks, angry at Yanukovych for spurning a trade deal with the European Union last month and turning to Moscow for help. ""He (Yanukovych) did not communicate with us, so how can he sign documents on our behalf?"" one protester occupying the central Independence Square, or Maidan, told CNN before the deal was announced. Despite the sub-zero temperatures, the demonstrators opposed to closer ties with Russia have stood their ground, setting up tents and barricades, paralyzing the city center. They were out in the tens of thousands Sunday -- the fourth weekend in a row -- urging their leaders to mend ties with Europe. Boosting trade . The agreements are intended to reverse a decline in trade between the two nations over the past two years, the leaders said, adding that the planned cooperation would be ""mutually beneficial"" to both economies. Yanukovych said the focus was on ""economic areas, which is basis of our working together in a bilateral way."" ""We are ready to look at the possibility of rapprochement in economic and political spheres,"" Putin said. Ahead of Tuesday's talks, Prime Minister Mykola Azarov rejected claims that Ukraine was leaning toward joining Russia and two other former Soviet republics, Belarus and Kazakhstan, in a Customs Union. ""These are speculations. None of the papers we have prepared are in any way related to the Customs Union,"" he said. Ukraine, Russia to sign trade road map, Prime Minister Mykola Azarov says . Economic issues . EU foreign ministers held talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Monday in Brussels, Belgium. EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said Moscow should not fear ""a detrimental effect on Russia"" as a result of Ukraine's signature of the EU deal. ""I don't believe that the crisis in Ukraine should have a negative impact on our relations with Russia. It does mean, though, that we have to look very seriously about the way in which countries make their decision and are entitled to make their decision,"" she said. Ahead of the talks, Ashton told reporters she believed the bloc could work with Yanukovych on Kiev's concerns, voiced since the Eastern European country backpedaled on signing the Association Agreement. ""We are very concerned when we look at some of the things that are being said, and my purpose in talking to President Yanukovych was to discover what these short-term economic issues are that have prevented him from signing,"" Ashton said. ""I feel that we can work with him to resolve those. Some of them can be done through the support of the European Union, others through financial institutions, some of them through the private sector. All of them are possible."" Stefan Fule, European commissioner for enlargement and European neighborhood policy, said a day earlier on Twitter that efforts were being halted amid growing doubts that any deal could be done with Kiev. Ukraine, a key transit region for Russian gas going to Western Europe, has desperately needed a cash injection. Azarov last week told a government meeting that Ukraine was still open to signing the European integration deal, if the European Union would agree to provide financial assistance to Ukraine of around 20 billion euros ($27.5 billion). Future ties . Some in Europe have accused Moscow of using strong-arm tactics to try to influence Ukraine's course, but Russia denies that charge. The tumult in Ukraine goes to the heart of its future ties with Russia and the rest of Europe. Ukraine is split between pro-European regions in the west and a more Russia-oriented east. The protests have unfolded since November 21, when Yanukovych changed his stance on the EU trade pact, which had been years in the making. The demonstrators say an EU agreement would open borders to trade and set the stage for modernization and inclusion.","Putin says Russia to buy Ukrainian debt, cut price its neighbor pays for its gas .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Crews resumed spraying water at the quake-damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear facility early Monday, Kyodo News reported, one day after the Japanese government slapped restrictions on some food produced around the plant. Workers have begun to see some success in their battle to cool down the reactors, but Japanese officials said they may need to release additional radioactive gas into the air. The plant's owner, Tokyo Electric Power Co., said electricity was being supplied to a switchboard in reactor No. 2. But officials said they were monitoring reactor No. 3 to determine whether to release gas to reduce mounting pressure in the containment vessel -- the steel and concrete shell that insulates radioactive material inside. Power company officials said pressure was higher than previous readings -- but stable -- Sunday afternoon. And Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said the pressure increase did not require ""an immediate release of the air at this moment."" Still, ""even in the best scenario, there will be a lot of bumps ahead,"" Edano told reporters as he assessed the situation at the plant in a briefing Sunday. There are six reactors at the nuclear plant, where workers have been struggling to stave off a full meltdown since a 9.0-magnitude earthquake and ensuing tsunami knocked out cooling systems. Workers have injected steam to release pressure in previous operations. The dual disasters, which struck March 11, devastated much of northeastern Japan. On Monday, the country's national police said 8,649 people were confirmed dead, 2,702 were injured and 12,877 remained missing as search efforts continued. In Miyagi prefecture alone -- one of the hardest-hit areas -- police said the death toll could climb to 15,000. Amidst the gloom came a ray of hope Sunday when medical officials in the Miyagi city of Ishinomaki said they had rescued an 80-year-old grandmother and her 16-year-old grandson, who had been trapped inside their house for nine days. Police were searching for survivors in the vicinity, Kadonowakimachi, in the southern part of Ishinomaki near the coast. The boy managed to crawl through the rubble onto the roof, the Ishinomaki police department said. A relative had reported the two missing on March 13, police said. In Fukushima, authorities have evacuated about 200,000 people from a 20-kilometer (12-mile) area surrounding the plant, but the crisis there has sparked concern across the country. Very small amounts -- far below the level of concern -- of radioactive iodine have been detected in tap water in Tokyo and most prefectures near the Fukushima plant. The health ministry said levels of radioactive iodine three times greater than the regulated standard were found in drinking water in a village near the Fukushima plant and asked residents not to drink from the tap, Kyodo News reported Sunday. The Japanese government has banned the sale of raw milk from Fukushima Prefecture, where the Fukushima Daiichi plant is located, and prohibited the sale of spinach from neighboring Ibaraki Prefecture after finding levels of radioactive iodine and cesium higher than government standards, the country's Health Ministry reported. And officials in Fukushima halted the distribution of locally grown vegetables outside the prefecture. Edano said the contaminated milk detected in Fukushima prefecture had not been distributed or sold. On Saturday, officials said tainted milk was found 30 kilometers (18 miles) from the plant, and spinach was collected as far as 100 kilometers (65 miles) to the south, almost halfway to Tokyo. A person who consumed the tainted food continuously for a year would take in the same amount of radiation as a single CT scan, Edano said Saturday. That's about 7 millisieverts, or double what an average person in an industrialized country is exposed to in a year, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. ""Even if you consume the spinach in question for a long time, it will not pose an immediate threat to your health,"" Edano said Sunday. Six members of an emergency crew working to restore electricity at the plant have been exposed to more than 100 millisieverts of radiation per hour. Officials say regaining electrical power could bring cooling systems back online -- a key step in curbing the further emission of radioactive material and preventing a full nuclear meltdown. A meltdown occurs when nuclear fuel rods get so hot that they melt the steel and concrete structure containing them, spilling out into the air and water with potentially deadly results. The earthquake and tsunami knocked out regular and backup cooling systems at the plant. It was unclear whether the cooling system in reactor No. 2 was working after power was restored Sunday. The plan is to get power up and running for the Numbers 1, 3 and 4 reactors soon. Cooling systems at the Numbers 5 and 6 reactors -- the least troublesome of the group -- have already been restored, Kyodo News said. On Saturday, authorities set up a new system to spray sea water continuously on the troubled reactors for extended periods of time. Previously, firefighters, soldiers and electric company workers had manually done the same in brief intervals to avoid prolonged radiation exposure. Water was directed at the No. 3 reactor's spent fuel pool on Saturday in order to cool it and prevent the emission of more radioactive material into the atmosphere.

"During the 90-minute ride of terror, Tamerlan Tsarnaev kept talking. He barked out orders, detailed his hatred of Americans and asked his carjacking victim to remain calm. Tsarnaev kept asking about the 26-year-old driver's heritage and family. ""If you cooperate, I won't kill you,"" said Tsarnaev, who, along with his younger brother, was a suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings and the killing of a police officer. The Massachusetts driver, whom CNN is identifying only as Danny because of privacy and safety concerns, gave his account of the April 18 incident and described the very different behavior of Tsarnaev and his younger brother, Dzhokhar. While the talkative Tamerlan was the ringleader during the carjacking, the quiet Dzhokhar responded to multiple orders, such as getting money from an ATM. The only question Dzhokhar asked was how much Danny paid for his Mercedes SUV. After the Chinese entrepreneur eventually escaped, police caught up with the brothers and engaged in a gun battle that left Tamerlan Tsarnaev dead. From fear to cheers: The final 24 hours that paralyzed Boston . Dzhokhar, wounded, was found later and is in police custody. Hours after authorities released images of the two bombing suspects, the brothers spontaneously decided to go to New York's Times Square to blow up their six remaining explosives, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told investigators. His account was outlined by New York's police commissioner. Before forcing their way into Danny's vehicle three days after the bombings, the brothers fatally shot a campus police officer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, police said. Tamerlan Tsarnaev said right after he got in the vehicle that he was responsible for the bombings and the officer's death, according to Danny. ""This is like something you see in a movie, isn't it?"" Tamerlan Tsarnaev said at one point during the carjacking. Danny, who first spoke with The Boston Globe, gave CNN this account of the carjacking in a more than hourlong conversation off-camera. -- Danny had stopped his vehicle to send a text when Tamerlan walked up and tapped on the window. The suspect, allegedly carrying a handgun, opened the door and got into the passenger seat. -- Dzhokhar followed in another vehicle. -- Under questioning by Tamerlan, Danny played up being Chinese and tried to humanize himself by talking about cell phones and family. Danny told CNN he felt being Chinese helped save his life. --  Eventually, Dzhokhar abandoned his vehicle and the three rode in Danny's SUV. Tamerlan started driving, using back streets in the Boston area, trying to avoid police and searching for an open gas station. -- Danny heard the word ""Manhattan"" at one point and thought the brothers were going to drive to New York, kill him on the way and dump his body under the bridge. -- When they stopped to refuel at a Shell gas station, Danny managed to slip away. He could feel Tamerlan grab him and heard him yell an expletive. Danny ran to a Mobil gas station, where he told an employee there what happened. Danny told CNN the fact that his car was low on gas helped save his life. During the carjacking, Danny thought about a girl in New York whom he really liked. He thought he'd never see her again.","Driver provides his account of Boston-area carjacking .

"Battling near-freezing temperatures and darkness, rescue workers and residents in eastern Turkey early Monday scoured the wreckage wrought by the country's most-powerful earthquake in more than a decade, hoping to find survivors. They used flashlights, shovels, heavy machinery and their hands to lift the debris, and climbed over collapsed buildings in search of  victims. At least 217 people were killed in Sunday's quake, said Turkish Interior Minister Idris Naim Sahin, the Anatolian news agency reported Monday. The previous official toll was 138. Another 350 people were injured in the quake, which the U.S. Geological Survey said had a magnitude of 7.2. Roughly 20 aftershocks rattled eastern Turkey in one of the nation's poorest areas. The largest had a magnitude of 6.0. One hundred people were killed in Van, while 117 were killed in Ercis, said Sahin, the Anatolian news agency reported. It also said that schools will be closed for a week in Van. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan told reporters the death toll is likely to climb, as rescue teams work through the night to save people still trapped in the rubble. The prime minister said 55 buildings collapsed in Ercis on the north shore of Lake Van, while the Turkish Red Crescent had said earlier that some 25 apartment buildings and a student dormitory collapsed in the town. Local rescuers took many wounded people out of the dormitory, a Red Crescent statement said, without saying exactly how many. A health services building also collapsed, along with part of a hospital, CNN sister network CNN Turk reported. The injured were being treated in the hospital's garden. ""People are really scared,"" said CNN Turk reporter Nevsin Mengu. ""The survivors are now trying to survive the cold weather."" She said many residents are not returning to their houses, but sleeping on rooftops or in the streets. It was not clear whether their homes were uninhabitable, or whether they were just too frightened. Electricity and natural gas were off in most of the city. Speaking from Van, Mengu said the death toll is almost sure to rise, as rescue teams have not yet reached some of the smaller villages. Trucks carrying medical aid and food were seen driving into Van. Official rescue efforts were also under way in Ercis, said CNN Turk reporter Sevda Incesu, but residents were conducting efforts of their own. Ambulances were having trouble getting into town because the roads were littered with debris, she said. Video footage from the scene showed survivors freed from the rubble being loaded onto stretchers amid a crush of rescue workers and bystanders. Heavy equipment was used to sift through the wreckage, as residents gathered around small fires. Are you there? Submit your pictures or video . The Red Crescent called for rescue workers, machinery and drinking water. A crisis center was set up by the country's Health Ministry in the Turkish capital, Ankara. Health Minister Recep Akdag said an air ambulance and several helicopters would go to the quake zone. Rescue teams of about 500 people were on the ground, according to the crisis center, and additional aid teams were dispatched from 29 surrounding cities. Medical helicopters were transporting the injured to hospitals in other provinces, the center said. Two tent hospitals were being set up in Ercis, and two cargo planes were dispatched from the capital carrying medical teams and aid. A seven-story building collapsed on Kazim Karabekir Street in the city of Van, and more buildings were reduced to rubble the village of Tabanli in Van province, the Anatolian news agency said.  It was unknown how many people were trapped. Prime Minister Erdogan and Health Minister Akdag arrived in the area Sunday, according to the Ministry of Health's crisis center. Israel offered Turkey ""any help it may require"" after the earthquake, Defense Minister Ehud Barak's office said. Israel and Turkey, once close allies, saw a deterioration in relations in a dispute over an Israeli naval commando raid on the Gaza-bound ship Mavi Marmara, in which nine Turkish activists were killed. Other nations and organizations offered condolences and assistance to Turkey. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the brave men and women who are working to bring assistance to this stricken region,"" U.S. President Barack Obama said in a statement. ""We stand shoulder to shoulder with our Turkish ally at this difficult time, and are ready to assist the Turkish authorities."" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton issued a similar statement. A spokesman for the Turkish Foreign Ministry said the country, while grateful for offers of aid, is prepared to handle the disaster on its own. Turkey is ""no stranger to having these seismic events,"" but Sunday's quake is considered major, CNN Meteorologist Reynolds Wolf reported. A magnitude 7.6 earthquake in Izmit, Turkey, killed more than 17,000 people in 1999, according to the USGS.  A magnitude 7.2 tremor in Duzce the same year killed 894 people, the USGS reported. Sunday's major quake hit at 1:41 p.m. local time. It took place about 12 miles from Van, the USGS said. The USGS reported a depth of 4.5 miles, or 7.2 kilometers; the center in Turkey said the quake was about 3 miles, or 5 kilometers, deep.","At least 217 people are reported dead; 350 are injured .

"A jaywalking rarely makes national news, but the arrest of Arizona professor Ersula Ore has done just that. What began as a walk home from classes at Arizona State University ended with police charging the professor with assault. The English professor was walking in the middle of a Tempe, Arizona, street one evening last month when a campus police officer stopped her. The incident escalated, and she was handcuffed and landed on the pavement. Appearing Monday on CNN's ""New Day,"" Ore was asked about her own words and actions in the incident and replied, ""I think I did what I was supposed to do. I was respectful. I asked for clarification. I asked to be treated with respect, and that was it."" In a dashboard camera recording released Friday, Ore steadfastly questions officer Stewart Ferrin and asks him to be respectful. The two talk over each other as the situation escalates, with Ferrin threatening to arrest Ore unless she produces her ID. ""If you don't understand the law, I'm explaining the law to you,"" the officer says. ""The reason I'm talking to you right now is because you are walking in the middle of the street."" Ore explains that she walked in the street to avoid construction. ""I never once saw a single solitary individual get pulled over by a cop for walking across a street on a campus, in a campus location,"" she says. The explanation does not satisfy, and Ferrin begins to cuff the professor. ""Don't touch me,"" Ore says, her voice beginning to rise. ""Get your hands off me."" The officer warns her to put her hands behind her back, or ""I'm going to slam you"" on the police car. ""You really want to do that?"" Ore asks. ""Do you see what I'm wearing?"" Ferrin responds, ""I don't care what you're wearing."" She kicks the officer. Shortly, Ore is on the ground. Her lawyer, Alane M. Roby, says the action caused her dress to ride up, ""exposing her anatomy to all onlookers."" Ore faces charges of assaulting a police officer, resisting arrest, failing to provide ID and obstructing a public thoroughfare. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for Thursday. The university said it  found ""no evidence of inappropriate actions by the ASUPD officers involved."" Given the ""underlying criminal charges,"" the university declined to provide any more details. Monday on ""New Day,"" Ore said the incident started when the officer stopped his car next to her and asked whether she knew the difference between a road and a sidewalk. She said she asked him, ""Do you always accost women in the middle of the road and speak to them with such disrespect and so rudely as you did to me?"" She said that at no point did he ask her name or tell her why she was being questioned. ""He throws the car door open actually, is what happens, and he's towering over me,"" she said. ""He's intimidating. I don't know why he's so aggressive."" Roby said they'll fight the charges and accused the officer of escalating the situation in violation of his training. ""Professor Ore's one crime that evening was to demand respect that she deserves as a productive, educated and tax paying member of society,"" Roby said in a statement to CNN, adding that they maintain any actions Ore took were in self-defense. That includes the caught-on-camera kick she delivered to the officer's shin. ""She can clearly be heard on the dash can video instructing the officer not to grab toward her genital area prior to him reaching for her in attempt to pull her skirt down over her exposed private area,"" Roby wrote. When asked on ""New Day"" about kicking the officer, Ore said she'd been advised by her lawyer not to comment. The incident has made headlines as far away as Iran and England. Closer to home, her department at the university has asked for a thorough investigation, including ""an audit on the conduct of its police force vis-a-vis racial profiling."" The university said it has completed one investigation. If evidence of officer wrongdoing surfaces, it said, an additional inquiry will be conducted and appropriate measures taken.","Professor Ersula Ore says officer disrespected her .

"So many hours of talks, so little progress. Despite two days of intensive negotiations, Iran and six world powers ""remain far apart"" on Tehran's controversial nuclear program, EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said Saturday in Kazakhstan. Her words dashed hopes that the deadlock might be broken after what had seemed more promising talks back in February, also in the Kazakh city of Almaty. Iran's top nuclear negotiator, Saeed Jalili, acknowledged there was ""some distance"" between Iran and the six powers but seemed more positive in his assessment. ""Good negotiations"" had taken place in this round of talks, Jalili said, which he described as ""substantive, expansive and comprehensive."" But in a sign that progress was limited, no date or location has been set for new talks. This round was just the latest in a decade-long attempt to resolve differences between Iran and the international community over Tehran's nuclear ambitions. The first day of talks proved inconclusive. By the end of Saturday, despite ""long and intensive discussions,"" the two sides were no closer on agreeing on confidence-building measures, Ashton told reporters. ""It became clear that the positions of (the world powers) and Iran remain far apart on the substance,"" she said. ""We therefore agreed all sides will go back to their capitals to evaluate where we stand on the process."" Ashton said she would be in touch with Jalili ""very soon in order to see how to go forward."" While Ashton said these were the most detailed discussions that the two sides had had, with ""a real back-and-forward between us,"" she also made clear that she was disappointed by the lack of progress made. A senior U.S. administration official said Jalili directly engaged him in a 30- to 40-minute question-and-answer exchange in the middle of Saturday's plenary meeting. ""The quality of the discussion was different because there was this back and forth, this Q and A,"" the official said. ""We just went back and forth with him."" Still, the official expressed disappointment, saying that Iran had ""put forward some minimal ideas and expected great return, and quite disproportionate return."" Britain, too, took a hard line after the talks. ""The UK went to Kazakhstan ready with our partners to negotiate in good faith with Iran,"" British Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement. ""Iran's current position falls far short of what is needed to achieve a diplomatic breakthrough."" When negotiators from the diplomatic bloc of six nations -- the United States, France, Britain, Germany, China and Russia -- last sat down with Iran's envoy in Almaty in February, they delivered what they characterized as a ""fair and balanced offer"" to defuse tensions over the Iranian nuclear program. Instead of delivering the ""concrete response"" Western governments had expected, Iran announced it was making its own proposal to the negotiating parties. 'Two-way street' Jalili said Iran had tabled a proposal based on the discussions in Almaty and a previous meeting in Moscow -- and that it is now down to the six world powers to respond and show their ""willingness to take appropriate confidence-building steps in the future."" He repeated Tehran's position that Iran has the right to a peaceful nuclear program. ""Creating confidence is a two-way street,"" he said. Now, after many proposals put forward by Iran, it's the turn of the six world powers to respond, he said. Jalili's comments on Iran's enrichment of uranium -- one of the most contentious issues at stake -- reaffirmed Tehran's right to pursue that track but also appeared to leave the door open to some kind of negotiation. ""Enrichment is part of the rights of the Iranian people, whether we're talking about 5% or 20% ... however, this can be an issue that can create further confidence,"" he said. Jalili added that ""hostile behaviors"" directed toward Iran were detrimental to building confidence. This was presumably a reference to the draconian sanctions imposed by Western governments against Tehran, which are crippling the Iranian economy. Oil exports have plummeted over the past several years, as has the value of Iran's currency. ""The purpose of any sanctions is to put pressure in order to get this process to work,"" said Ashton. ""And I believe we should continue to work as hard as we possibly can to make sure we are successful and we reach a satisfactory resolution."" Questions fly around any plan to attack Iran . The so-called P5+1 governments are demanding that Iran come clean about its nuclear program, which they suspect includes covert development of nuclear weapons. Iran consistently denies those charges, arguing it is enriching uranium and building nuclear reactors only for peaceful civilian energy needs. Details of last February's offer from the six countries represented across the negotiating table from Iran have not yet been made public. Last month, technical experts from Iran and the P5+1 countries met for more than 12 hours in Istanbul to discuss the proposal. Iran's deputy chief negotiator said the Iranian proposal tabled Friday was based on a previous PowerPoint presentation that the Iranian delegation submitted during a round of talks in Moscow in June 2012. ""The Islamic Republic of Iran proposed a practical method to implement the Moscow plan in a smaller scale,"" Ali Baghery said in a statement issued to journalists Friday. The offer, he said, was aimed at establishing ""a new bedrock of cooperation."" A call for 'concrete actions' Washington has vowed it will continue to put pressure on Tehran. ""As long as Iran does not take concrete steps to address the concerns of the international community about its nuclear program, the dual-track process continues. And that pressure only will increase if Iran does not begin to take concrete steps and concrete actions,"" said a senior U.S. administration official in a telephone briefing to journalists this week. The official spoke on condition of anonymity. Iran argues that as a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, development of nuclear technology is an inalienable right. On the eve of the two-day talks in Kazakhstan, Jalili repeated this position in a speech given at a university in Almaty. ""It is the right of the Iranian people to peaceful nuclear energy and most importantly to enrichment,"" Jalili said. A report recently published by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace concluded that sanctions are unlikely to force Tehran to give up its nuclear program. The report, titled ""Iran's Nuclear Odyssey,"" highlighted the fact that Tehran's quest for a nuclear program has been going on for more than half a century, beginning under the rule of the pro-American shah, Reza Pahlavi, and continuing under the revolutionary Islamic republic that overthrew him. ""The program's cost -- measured in lost foreign investment and oil revenue -- has been well over $100 billion,"" Carnegie said.","""Iran's current position falls far short of what is needed,"" says British official .

"Millions of ""Downton Abbey"" viewers were shocked Sunday night when one of the show's main characters, Lady Sybil Branson, died from eclampsia shortly after delivering a daughter. ""Although the fictional TV series represents life in the early 1900s, women in the United States and elsewhere still die or suffer terrible outcomes from the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy,"" including preeclampsia and eclampsia, the Preeclampsia Foundation said in a statement issued after the show aired Sunday night. Here, five things you should know about preeclampsia and eclampsia: . 1. Eclampsia is a serious complication of preeclampsia. It's characterized by one or more seizures during pregnancy or in the postpartum period. ""In the developed world, eclampsia is rare and usually treatable if appropriate intervention is promptly sought,"" according to the Preeclampsia Foundation. Left untreated, however, the seizures can result in coma, brain damage and potentially in maternal or infant death. Preeclampsia is typically treated with magnesium sulfate, as it has been proven to be extremely effective at preventing eclampsia from occurring, said Dr. Jim Martin, a member of the foundation's medical board and immediate past president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. ""We see most eclampsia now after delivery (in the United States),"" Martin said, ""because we use medications to prevent it during labor and delivery."" Previously, as seen on ""Downton Abbey,"" ""the highest-risk time was at the end of pushing efforts for vaginal delivery,"" he said. ""The way I teach it ... is eclampsia really is preeclampsia affecting the brain,"" he said. Preeclampsia can also affect the liver -- a condition known as HELLP syndrome -- or the kidneys, Martin said. 2. Preeclampsia typically appears after the 20th week of pregnancy. It most frequently is seen during the third trimester. It's characterized by a large rise in blood pressure and failing kidneys. Doctors monitor an expectant mother's blood pressure as well as check for excessive protein in her urine. ""It's considered to be a complication of the second half of pregnancy and after delivery,"" Martin said. Preeclampsia was initially thought to be a disorder preceding eclampsia, hence its name, according to the foundation. Doctors used to believe eclampsia was a progression of preeclampsia, but seizures can occur all of a sudden in women who previously have not shown signs of preeclampsia, he said. Preeclampsia, along with other hypertensive disorders of pregnancy such as HELLP syndrome, impact about 5 to 8% of births in the United States, according to the foundation. The condition underscores the need for prenatal care, Martin said. ""There are supposedly 50,000 deaths in the world due to eclampsia,"" most of them in developing countries where prenatal care is not widely available, he said. 3. Preeclampsia is more likely to occur during the first pregnancy. Risk factors for preeclampsia include multiple gestation (pregnant with more than one baby); a history of chronic high blood pressure, diabetes, kidney disease or organ transplant; a family history of preeclampsia; maternal age and obesity, particularly with a body mass index over 30. ""It's still correctly described as a disease of the age extremes,"" most often seen in pregnant teenagers or pregnant women in their late 30s and 40s, Martin said. However, women who did not have preeclampsia in their first pregnancy should not believe they're in the clear, he said. HELLP syndrome, for instance, is more common in later pregnancies. The cause of preeclampsia is unknown. However, there is ""general agreement that the placenta plays a key role in preeclampsia, and women with chronic hypertension and certain metabolic diseases like diabetes are more susceptible,"" according to the Preeclampsia Foundation. ""Pregnancy causes it, but beyond that, the specific problem between the fetus and mother, and the genes from the father and so forth ... is not completely clear,"" Martin said. Women with preeclampsia are more likely to have complications such as low birthweight, premature birth or placental abruption, where the placenta separates from the wall of the uterus before birth, according to the March of Dimes. 4. Preeclampsia can be silent. ""Often, women who have preeclampsia do not feel sick,"" according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine. Martin said often, he has to convince women to come in and be evaluated as they do not feel ill. ""It's such a gradual, insidious onset, they don't realize they're hypertensive or getting sick."" Symptoms can include, but aren't limited to: . -- Swelling of the hands and face, or edema. Note some swelling is considered normal during pregnancy, Martin said, but doctors specifically look for swelling in the face and behind the eyes. -- Sudden weight gain over one to two days -- more than 2 pounds a week . In severe cases: . -- Headache that does not go away . -- Abdominal pain on the right side, below the ribs, or also in the right shoulder . -- Nausea and vomiting . -- Vision changes: Temporary blindness, seeing flashing lights or spots, sensitivity to light, blurry vision . 5. The only ""cure"" for preeclampsia is delivery. If preeclampsia is diagnosed before a baby is considered ""term,"" or 37 weeks, bed rest, medication or even hospitalization may be required, according to the Preeclampsia Foundation. Eclampsia cases before delivery can be treated with steroids, Martin said. Most cases of postpartum preeclampsia develop within 48 hours of childbirth, but may develop four to six weeks postpartum, according to the Mayo Clinic. Delivery begins the cure, Martin said, as tissue is left behind after the placenta is removed and is shed by a new mother in the days following the birth. ""While obviously not dangerous for the baby, postpartum preeclampsia is still critical for the mother,"" according to the Preeclampsia Foundation. ""Nearly 80% of women who die from preeclampsia die postpartum. Sleep deprivation, postpartum depression, more attention on the newborn and a lack of familiarity with normal postpartum experiences all contribute to more easily ignoring or missing indicators of a problem."" ""They're focused on the baby,"" Martin said. ""They expect to have some headaches and not feel great,"" but don't realize severe headaches can indicate a problem.","A character on ""Downton Abbey"" dies from eclampsia after childbirth .

"(CNN) -- For decades -- dating back to the 1980s -- Apple and Adobe Systems have had a deeply troubled relationship. The most recent phase of their ongoing struggle has been over whether Flash (Adobe's hugely popular proprietary format for adding animation, video, and interactivity to web pages) would run on Apple mobile devices. Apple has always resisted putting Flash on the iPhone, because Flash has performed notoriously poorly on Macintosh computers. But these days internet access is swiftly going mobile, and Apple's iPhone holds the most interactivity- and video-hungry portion of the smartphone market. Apple does offer a mobile app that re-encodes YouTube Flash videos to play on the iPhone, but in general Flash elements won't play on Apple mobile devices. So Adobe has been trying hard to get Apple to support Flash on the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. It looks like Adobe has finally lost this battle. Last week Adobe Systems released Wallaby -- an experimental new drag-and-drop tool for developers that converts Flash files into HTML5. HTML5 is an emerging web standard that can work with the fully featured browsers available on most mobile devices, including the iPhone and iPad. It allows developers to build mobile web pages that are much more interactive and multimedia-rich. (Technically, it's now called just HTML, but most people are still saying ""HTML5"" to refer to the new capabilities.) Also, HTML5 can be used to build mobile apps that work offline. As CNN Money recently explained, HTML5 web apps ""can still function in areas with no connection. Gamers, for instance, can continue playing uninterrupted even if their device loses its signal."" In January, The New York Times reported that many online content services, including Vimeo and Flickr, are experimenting with using HTML5 to deliver video and other rich media, probably driven in part by Apple's lack of mobile support for Flash. The Washington Post reports that Wallaby (a program that runs on the Adobe AIR platform, which does work with Apple's iOS mobile operating system) ""was tested with iOS 4.2. The only supported Webkit browsers at this time are Chrome and Safari on OSX, Windows and iOS."" What does this mean for iPhone users? If Wallaby becomes popular with developers, then many websites that use Flash to present interactive features or multimedia content -- anything from videos to games to simulations and more -- may suddenly start working right on the iPhone and iPad. So iPhone and iPad users will encounter fewer of those annoying blank holes on web pages where multimedia is supposed to appear. But in the big picture, if most internet access goes mobile (as Gartner predicted will happen by 2013), then there might be less and less reason for web developers to use Flash. It could be that HTML5 might become the norm, and Flash might fade into the mists of tech history. Daniel Eran Dilger predicted Adobe's move to accommodate HTML5 almost a year ago, in his brilliant mock-biblical chronicle of the history of Adobe vs. Apple, an amazingly entertaining read. Dilger wrote: ""...And Adobe saw four horsemen of the apocalypse ascending from the sea, the rider of the white horse was Steve Jobs and he was bent on conquest. And a second horse, red, was given to iPhone to take away market share from smartphones, and to cause phone makers to wage war and to fall upon their own swords. ""And a third horse, black, was carrying the scales of the iPod touch, and it measured out music playback from iTunes and sold many apps and starved other mobile platforms of mobile application demand. And fourth horse, pale, had a rider named iPad, which pundits called Death. And it caused famine for tablets and plague for slates and killed with a sword. And none of the horsemen used Flash. ""And Adobe frightfully woke from its vision of terrors, and realized that its days of monopolizing the web with Flash content were over. ""...And then Adobe began building HTML5 development tools, and it charged reasonable prices and built cross-platform products and the people rejoiced and Adobe's death was spared and it lived comfortably for many days next to Apple. ""And Steve Jobs said thank you and Adobe said no, thank you. And they all lived happily ever after.""","Adobe's Flash does not work on Apple's iPhones or iPads .

"He was born and raised in the United States, and killed by the United States. And now from beyond the grave he inspires a new generation of would-be terrorists to attack the United States. Militant cleric Anwar al-Awlaki continues to speak through sermons posted online, and U.S. officials are investigating whether his words may have influenced Boston bombers Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. A U.S. government official told CNN's Jake Tapper on Tuesday that ""the preachings of Anwar al-Awlaki were likely to have been among the videos they watched."" A U.S. government source had previously told CNN that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev had claimed the brothers had no connection to overseas Islamist terrorist groups and were radicalized through the Internet. Al-Awlaki lived in Colorado, California and Virginia before leaving the United States in 2002. At one point he met two of the men who would be among the 9/11 hijackers, an encounter later investigated by the FBI. There is no evidence that al-Awlaki knew of their plans. From about 2006 onward he became increasingly influential among would-be jihadists around the world with his eloquent online sermons delivered in fluent and colloquial English. Al-Awlaki was killed in a U.S. drone strike in a remote part of Yemen in September 2011, along with another American,  Samir Khan. U.S investigators are examining whether the Tsarnaev brothers downloaded or viewed a bomb formula that appeared in Inspire, the online English-language magazine published by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Al-Awlaki is believed to have been the driving force behind that magazine and Samir Khan was its editor. The pressure cooker devices exploded in Boston had several striking similarities to a design in the first issue of the magazine in the summer of 2010 ""How to build a bomb in Your Mom's Kitchen."" The magazine instructed would-be jihadists in the West to deploy multiple devices and set them off simultaneously in a crowded space. Another issue of the magazine published a year ago called for attacks at crowded sports venues. The Inspire recipe ""How to Build a Bomb in your Mom's Kitchen"" has been linked to multiple Islamist terrorist plots on both sides of the Atlantic. It was downloaded by a group of Islamist extremists plotting to bomb London in late 2010. In July 2011, an American Muslim soldier from Fort Hood, Texas -- Naser Jason Abdo -- downloaded the recipe and bought pressure cookers and shotgun shells from which he could extract explosive powder. Abdo was arrested before he had assembled a bomb and was sentenced last year to two consecutive life prison sentences for attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction. New York resident Jose Pimentel allegedly began building a pipe bomb using the recipe before being arrested by New York police in November 2011. Pimentel was charged with plotting to bomb targets in the United States; he has pleaded not guilty. The Emergence of a ""jihadist rock star"" Awlaki was born in New Mexico. He spent some time in Yemen as a teenager before coming back to the United States. His time in America helped him speak to radicals in a language they could understand and grasp the vulnerabilities of open societies in the West. His sermons were sometimes  impassioned and dwelt on the topic of jihad,  but many mainstream Muslims did not then regard him as an extremist. After leaving the United States,  al-Awlaki intensified his preaching -- recording DVD sermons that became extremely popular among Islamists across the Western world.  He spent time in London and was very popular among congregations in more radical mosques with his sermons on the injustices he alleged were being perpetrated by the West against Islam. As one East London imam later put it, ""He left the congregations all revved up with nowhere to go."" Behind closed doors, it was a different story. In small study circles al-Awlaki spoke out in favor of suicide bombings in the West, according to one British imam. One such meeting was attended by undercover MI5 agents, prompting British authorities to ban him from traveling to the United Kingdom, the imam told CNN. Avid consumers of al-Awlaki's videos included the so-called Toronto 18, who plotted to launch attacks across Canada in 2006, and the British al Qaeda cell that plotted to bomb trans-Atlantic airliners the same year. Several of those who plotted to attack the Fort Dix military base in New Jersey in 2007 were also big fans of the cleric's sermons. And two of the al Qaeda terrorist cell that plotted to bomb New York subways in 2009 later admitted they were radicalized by al-Awlaki's sermons. Al-Awlaki eventually resettled in Yemen, where he made clear to followers that he supported al Qaeda's campaign of violence against the United States. In 2006, al-Awlaki was imprisoned by Yemeni authorities and was interviewed by FBI officials.  His former friends have told CNN that when al-Awlaki was released 18 months later he was a changed man, hardened by the experience. And he began communicating with admirers around the world. One of them was Maj. Nidal Hasan of the U.S. Army, who had once attended al-Awlaki's sermons at a mosque in Falls Church, Virginia. On December 17, 2008, Hasan sent the cleric the first of what would become a stream of e-mails. He wanted to know if Awlaki considered American Muslim soldiers who turned their guns on their fellow soldiers martyrs. Not long afterward the cleric replied. In one e-mail, Hasan said he could not wait to join al-Awlaki in the afterlife, where they could have discussions over non-alcoholic wine.  Two FBI task forces had reviewed the intercepted e-mails and concluded there were no grounds for action against Hasan, that the messages could be construed as a legitimate part of his work as an army psychologist. But on the morning of November 6, 2009, Hasan gunned down 13 U.S soldiers at the Fort Hood military base in Texas, and those communications were seen in a very different light. Al-Awlaki did nothing to distance himself from Hasan's attack. Within two days of Fort Hood, the cleric wrote on his website: ""Nidal Hasan is a hero. ... The US is leading the war against terrorism, which in reality is a war against Islam."" By then al-Awlaki had begun orchestrating a potentially much more deadly plot against the United States. In the late summer and fall of 2009 he recruited a young Nigerian for the mission, according to sources who were close to al-Awlaki at the time. Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab had come to Yemen in the hope of meeting the cleric. According to U.S. court documents, when the two met they discussed martyrdom and jihad for three days. By the end of that time, the young Nigerian told the cleric he was ready for any mission, martyrdom included. Weeks later, on Christmas Day 2009, AbdulMutallab came close to destroying Northwest Airlines Flight 253 on its final descent into Detroit with an explosive device hidden in his underwear. According to the U.S. government, al-Awlaki was intimately involved in planning the operation. In the following months a new wave of plots emerged linked to the preaching of al-Awlaki. On May 1, 2010, Faisal Shahzad, an American-Pakistani recruited by the Pakistani Taliban, attempted to blow up a car bomb in New York's Times Square. Investigators later discovered that he had been inspired by al-Awlaki's preaching about violent jihad. In October 2010, al-Awlaki was involved with a new attempt by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to blow up U.S.-bound aircraft by inserting explosive devices in printer cartridges destined for the United States. Investigators later described the hidden devices as very sophisticated and well camouflaged, and the plot was thwarted only thanks to a tip-off from Saudi intelligence. The bombs were intercepted while en route. By 2011, Inspire magazine had a simple message for followers in the United States: Stay where you are and launch attacks at home.  Its reach continued to grow around the world. CNN has established that the Dagestan wing of the Caucasus Emirate, a jihadist group fighting to create an Islamic state in the region, posted a Russian language translation of a 2012 issue on their website, along with videos of al-Awlaki. Tamerlan Tsarnaev posted a link to a video by a local commander of the group -- Abu Dujana -- on his YouTube site after traveling to Dagestan in 2012. Even in death al-Awlaki's influence has persisted. In May 2012 a posthumous  article in his name was published in which he sought to justify biological and chemical attacks against the United States. The magazine proclaimed: ""We are still publishing America's worst nightmare. ... All of his students will follow his steps and this is how we win.""","Though he's dead, militant cleric Anwar al-Awlaki remains influential .

"The former superintendent of Atlanta Public Schools was among the educators who surrendered to authorities Tuesday after being indicted by a grand jury in a cheating scandal that rocked the district and drew national attention. Beverly Hall resigned from her position in 2011 after a state investigation into large, unexplained test score gains in some Atlanta schools. She has denied any role in the cheating scandal. A Fulton County grand jury last week indicted 35 educators from the district, including principals, teachers and testing coordinators. They were ordered to turn themselves in by Tuesday, District Attorney Paul Howard said. By 10:00 p.m., 27 of 35 educators had turned themselves in at the Fulton County Jail to face charges including racketeering, theft by taking and making false statements about their roles in an alleged plot to falsify students' standardized tests. Eight of them had been released on bond late Tuesday, the Fulton County Sheriff's office said. In 2009, Hall was named the National Superintendent of the Year by the Schools Superintendents Association, which at the time said her ""leadership has turned Atlanta into a model of urban school reform."" Grand jury indicts 35 in Georgia school cheating scandal . But the indictment paints another picture of Hall, one of a superintendent with ""a single-minded purpose, and that is to cheat,"" Howard told reporters last week. According to the indictment, Hall placed unreasonable goals on educators and ""protected and rewarded those who achieved targets by cheating."" It also alleges she fired principals who failed to achieve goals and ""ignored suspicious"" test score gains throughout the school system. Her bond was reduced from $7.5 million to $200,000, the Fulton County Sheriff's office reported. On Tuesday, bond was set at $1 million for Donald Bullock, a testing coordinator at Usher/Collier Heights Elementary School, Theresia Copeland, a testing coordinator at Benteen Elementary School, and Gregory Reid, a Parks Middle School assistant principal. Bond amounts were set by grand jurors. Others who turned themselves in included testing coordinators, teachers and an instructional coach, said Fulton County Sheriff spokeswoman Tracy Flanagan. Investigations into the remarkable improvements on standardized tests were first reported by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution newspaper. A state review determined that some cheating had occurred in more than half  the district's elementary and middle schools. About 180 teachers were implicated initially. Cheating is believed to date back to early 2001, when standardized testing scores began to turn around in the 50,000-student school district, according to the indictment. For at least four years, between 2005 and 2009, test answers were altered, fabricated and falsely certified, the indictment said. ""We've had cheating all up and down the line. It was absolutely amazing,"" said Michael Bowers, a former Georgia attorney general who investigated the cheating scandal. Bowers said there were cheating parties, erasures in and out of classrooms, and teachers were told to make changes to tests. ""Anything that you can imagine that could involve cheating, it was done."" During the investigation, he heard that educators cheated out of pride, to earn bonuses, to enhance their careers or to keep their jobs, he said. Some teachers, overcome with emotion, fainted during his interview with them, he said. ""Not only were the children deprived, a lot of teachers were forced into cheating, forced into criminal acts,"" Bowers said. ""Now, granted, they did wrong, but a lot of them did this to protect jobs."" Educators and community members reacted Tuesday to the charges. ""The Atlanta school community is obviously very upset about this,"" said Stephen J. Alford, Atlanta Public Schools' executive director of communications. ""I don't want to pass judgment on the people, but we've had a lot of parents who wanted to express their disappointment."" In a statement, American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten and Georgia Federation of Teachers President Verdaillia Turner wrote: ""We do not condone cheating under any circumstances. Academic achievement can never be separated from academic integrity, which is why the Georgia Federation of Teachers was the first whistle-blower to expose Atlanta testing irregularities. ""Tragically, the Atlanta cheating scandal harmed our children and it crystallizes the unintended consequences of our test-crazed policies.""","Beverly Hall, the district's former superintendent, turns herself in .
26 other educators had surrendered to authorities by Tuesday night .
Some Atlanta educators' bonds were set at $1 million .
35 were indicted, accused of cheating on standardized testing dating back to 2001 ."
"Attorneys and a federal judge are expected to meet in a North Carolina courtroom Friday afternoon for a status hearing regarding the pending criminal trial of John Edwards, the former presidential candidate and U.S. senator. The hearing comes after attorneys on both sides filed several motions, many of them sealed from the public. In December, attorneys for Edwards asked again to delay his criminal trial, saying Edwards had an unspecified medical issue. Last year, the Justice Department charged Edwards with conspiracy, issuing false statements and violating campaign contribution laws. He has pleaded not guilty. Last September, the trial was delayed until January 30 after Edwards' attorneys said he needed more time, in part due to his position as the sole caretaker of his two youngest children, ages 11 and 13, after his wife, Elizabeth, passed away in December 2010. The motion to continue the trial for 60 days filed on December 22 said Edwards' ""unexpected"" medical issue is explained in a sealed exhibit. The issue will ""prevent a trial of this matter during the January 2012 criminal term,"" according to the motion, and cannot be resolved before the end of the term. Attorneys for Edwards, who was the Democratic vice-presidential nominee in 2004 alongside John Kerry, also say in the motion a January trial would not give them enough time to prepare, especially given the ""unusual and complex"" prosecution. ""Since this trial date was set, the government has produced as part of the discovery process an additional 103,102 pages of material including more than 91,000 e-mails as well as 26 voicemails received by cooperating witnesses between 2007 and 2010,"" the motion says. In addition, both the government and Edwards are seeking evidence from North Carolina state courts. ""Absent a continuance, Mr. Edwards' counsel will not be able to effectively use the evidence the government was obligated to provide him ... and this, in turn, threatens Mr. Edwards' right to effective counsel and a fair trial,"" according to the motion. ""This is not hyperbole. Mr. Edwards' counsel are experienced trial lawyers and they are and have been working hard -- long hours, late nights and weekends -- and they have not made it their practice to seek unwarranted continuances."" It is unclear if a decision has been made on whether the trial has been delayed. A chief issue in the upcoming trial is whether money given to support Edwards' mistress, Rielle Hunter, by the then-candidate's benefactors should have been considered campaign donations, a contention Edwards' team has disputed. They maintain the money was a gift to Hunter. If convicted on all counts, Edwards could face 30 years in prison and a fine of up to $1.5 million.","The trial was set to start January 30 after a delay in September .
Edwards' attorneys are asking for 60 more days .
They say they need time to review evidence provided by prosecutors ."
"(CNN)If you think ""my teen would never sext,"" you might be mistaken. And if you think the only teens who sext are the ones engaging in high-risk behaviors, like drinking, using drugs or skipping school, keep reading. Two recent studies suggest that sexting is more common than many parents might realize or want to admit. More than half the undergraduate students who took part in an anonymous online survey said they sexted when they were teenagers, according to the study by Drexel University, which was published in June by the Journal of Sexuality Research and Social Policy. Nearly 30% said they included photos in their sexts, and an astonishing 61% did not know that sending nude photos via text could be considered child pornography. Another study, this one by the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, found that while students who admitted sexting were 32% more likely to report having sex the next year, sexting by teenagers was not linked to risky sexual behavior over time. The study, published in the journal Pediatrics in October, found that teens who sexted were not more likely to have multiple sexual partners, use drugs or alcohol before sex or not use birth control. Sexting may be the new ""normal' when it comes to adolescent sexual behavior, the study concluded. ""There are now a few pieces of research, which are sort of converging on the same finding, namely that this is not a rare behavior,"" said Elizabeth Englander, a professor of psychology at Bridgewater State University and director of the Massachusetts Aggression Reduction Center. ""I'm not saying that it's healthy or that it's harmless, but it's not a situation where kids who are depressed are doing this or kids who have very bad self-esteem are doing it,"" said Englander, who researched sexting, as well as a host of other teenager behaviors, for her recent book ""Bullying and Cyberbullying."" ""It appears to be widespread. It's engaged in by many kids who are functioning well and not having problems and it's not very unusual or rare."" OPINION: What's the big deal about sexting? Diana Graber, who teaches ""cybercivics"" to middle schoolers in Aliso Viejo, California, was blown away by the response she got recently from eighth graders when she, for the first time, included a session on sexting. When she asked her students if they knew what a sext was, everyone in the class said they did, but what they didn't know was what the penalties for sending a sext could be, including how it could be prosecuted as a felony under child pornography laws in some states. ""They had no idea what the consequences were,"" said Graber, co-founder of CyberWise.org, a digital literacy site for parents, educators, and tweens and teens. ""I mean that was a complete surprise to literally all 28 kids, so it occurred to me that no one's ever bothered to tell these kids they couldn't do that."" Graber said she experienced another first that day. A few students wanted to hang around after the class, which is held at the end of the school day, to talk more about sexting and related things. ""That's never happened to me before with this class ... and I realized that I had created a safe space for them to talk about something that was super relevant to their lives."" She now plans to make it part of her ""cybercivics"" curriculum, and believes parents and educators need to be talking to kids at even younger ages about sexting. It should be part of sex education, she said. ""We know that throwing the book at them, it's too much too late, so that's not working,"" said Graber, who offers tips for parents on how to help children have safe online relationships. ""It's very normal teenage behavior ... and we need to get with the times and get ahead of the problem, and just have these very easy to have discussions."" Englander, the psychology professor and researcher, says in her experience, it's not that adults aren't warning teens about the criminal consequences for underage sexting or how devastating it could be to a teen if their nude photo became public. The problem, she says, is kids don't hear the warnings because the reality doesn't fit them. In a recent online article, she used an example of telling someone to use a seat belt because half the car rides in the country result in someone going through the windshield. Since half of car rides don't result in someone going through the windshield, a person might not listen to that warning, she says. ""If you want to convince somebody that something is a danger, you have to convince them that you know what you're talking about, "" said Englander. ""So you can't say to kids 'Oh, you are going to go to jail if you sext.' It's not 100% impossible but even in the early cases of sexting, when (law enforcement) did prosecute kids, they didn't go to jail."" ""People have a hard time with this. It's not that I'm saying we shouldn't teach kids that child pornography is a crime. It is a crime, but if we emphasize that that's the big danger then we've lost our audience."" Englander said what she is most troubled by is not how widespread sexting might be but how teens feel after they sext, especially if they felt pressured to do it. In her own research, she said she found that 92% of the teens who said they were not pressured to sext reported no problems afterward, but that number is only 68% for teens who felt pressured into doing it. ""They felt crummy afterwards,"" said Englander. ""That was actually the most common result, that they just felt worse."" Lori Cunningham, founder of Well Connected Mom, a site specializing in simplifying technology for families, said parents need to remind their children about their own self-worth. ""And that no matter how tempting it is to want to be 'liked' by someone, they are worth more than degrading themselves for someone else's enjoyment,"" said Cunningham, a mom of two in Los Angeles. ""If parents aren't having this conversation, their kids could be going through some tremendous pressure."" Cunningham also says parents need to be actively involved in their children's online lives. In a new eBook, she outlines the points parents should go over with their child when they get a phone, including setting up a contract so they understand their phone will be monitored. ""Phones are a privilege, not a right. They should only be given to kids with the expectation that mom or dad will be checking it on a daily basis."" What all the experts believe is that parents and educators should be talking to kids about obeying the law, protecting their privacy and reputation, and respecting everyone's right to keep their bodies private, but also their own values about the issue. ""Your kids can go into these things knowing absolutely nothing, having no idea of what you think is right or wrong, having no idea of the facts or you can talk to them about it. Those are the only two choices,"" said Englander. ""I don't think in today's world you can assume that they're never going to run across sexting, they're never going to see it, they're never going to know it happens."" ""That's a big assumption to make."" What do you think is the best way to talk to teens about sexting?

"Ever since it appeared on the cover of Animals, Pink Floyd's 1977 album, Battersea Power Station in London has been famous around the world. It has appeared in everything from the Beatles' 1965 movie Help! to Christopher Nolan's 2008 Batman movie The Dark Knight, and even Dr Who. But later this year, its distinctive chimneys -- the best-loved parts of one of London's best-loved buildings -- will be demolished. Then they will be built back up again. ""The chimneys are the most powerful part of the icon,"" says Jim Eyre, director of Wilkinson Eyre, the architects commissioned to develop the building. ""Take them away, and you don't have an icon. The coal fumes has decayed the concrete, so they have to come down. But we're going to painstakingly reconstruct them."" Such will be the attention to detail that even the paint used will be precisely the same hue. And it will be sourced from the same manufacturer that provided the paint for the original chimneys, more than 80 years ago. The replacement of the chimneys is just the first stage in a development that will change Battersea Power Station forever, arousing a passionate debate. A London Icon . The power station was built in the Thirties as a functioning coal-fired electricity generator. But the building was so distinctive that it became recognized as a valuable part of the cityscape. The station stopped functioning in 1983, and has since fallen into disrepair. It's vast -- St Paul's Cathedral, another of London's landmarks, could snugly fit into its old turbine rooms -- and over the years it has  acquired the status of one of the architectural world's best-known white elephants. Now, funded by Malaysian developers, work is underway to transform the building into a massive complex of retail space, offices, and luxury ""villas"". Crowning the top of the development, at a height of more than 160 feet, there will be a roof garden. The first phase will be completed in 2016. Eyre's plans for the chimneys are emblematic of his approach towards developing the site. ""Two of them are still going to be used as flues for the massive, modern energy center that we're going to construct to power the place,"" he says. ""The third will remain hollow with a glass roof, and the fourth will house a cylindrical glass elevator that will pop out at the top at a viewing platform."" Although the massive central cavity will be split into five floors and stuffed with stores and offices, Eyre has included several areas where a ""cut-out"" will allow a glimpse of the distant ceiling. ""There was a temptation to fill it right to the edges,"" he says. ""But when you enter the building, there will be an opening into a big space that will preserve the stunning sense of volume."" Care will be taken to protect a flavor of the past on the inside, too. In an approach that Eyre calls ""light renovation"", graffiti and the stains of age will not be scrubbed clean or painted over. As part of the development, the building will be surrounded by large, modern office and retail blocks, with the flanks of the power station obscured from many angles. Many feel that this is a shame, while others argue that this is the price for attracting investment to the site. Questions have been raised, however, over the price of the new apartments. At £2,000 per square foot, they will cost the same as those in the ""golden postcodes"" of Kensington and Chelsea and parts of Westminster. For an icon that represents all of London, that seems a little exclusive. ""I am aware of that,"" he says. ""The control room, for instance, is a wonderful example of art deco extravagance. It would be easy to turn it into a restaurant, but it would be a very expensive restaurant. Instead it will be a space for public events, like fashion shows."" Controversial restoration . The development of the Battersea Power Station has re-opened the highly-charged debate about whether -- and how -- iconic buildings should be preserved, modified or replaced, and who they ""belong"" to. In this age of technology, fast-paced social change and innovation, many see it as the most important architectural dilemma of our times. Sir Terry Farrell, one of Britain's foremost architects hose credits include everything from Charing Cross Station to the MI6 headquarters on the banks of the Thames, is sharply critical of Eyre's design. ""I think it's rather sad,"" he told CNN. ""There's quite a fashion for keeping the outside appearance of a building at the expense of the interior. When you're inside Battersea Power Station, you won't know it because the corridors, shops and apartments will be the same as everywhere else."" ""My feeling is that it's the sheer opportunity to get a couple of million square feet in there. Under the pretext of keeping the shell of the building, you're getting planning consent for a lot of space. In London, you can charge £2,000 per square foot. That's quite a lot of money, and I can see the temptation. But there are other ways that could work just as well."" Farrell's own design for the site, which was not taken forward because of fears over planning permission, would have turned the power station into an ""iconic ruin"" standing over a massive public space. It would have been made financially viable by the construction of high-value apartments around the power station. ""I said that what we should do is remove the walls but retain the colonnade, and make the whole interior a park,"" he said. ""It would be like a giant abbey ruins, or a Greek temple with just the columns and no roof. The key features, like the control rooms, would be kept exactly in the place they occurred on legs."" This, he argued, would enable people to ""go in and feel the space"". ""You would understand far more what it used to be. It would be a sort of monument,"" he said. ""It would be far better than going to a shopping center, or a luxury home, and saying, 'do you realize this used to be Battersea Power Station?'"" Such controversy is only to be expected when the future of such an important building as this is at stake. And the more iconic a building, the more forensic critics of its redevelopment will be.

"ST. PAUL, Minnesota (CNN) -- News of Jaycee Dugard's safe return after 18 years in captivity gives Patty Wetterling hope. Patty Wetterling says the return of Jaycee Dugard ""is reaffirming"" and ""a success."" Wetterling's son Jacob is still missing after a gunpoint abduction almost 20 years ago near their home in St. Joseph, Minnesota. ""Jacob was with his best friend and his brother. They witnessed it,"" Wetterling says, recalling that day back in October 1989. ""They saw this masked man with a gun."" Jaycee Dugard's return ""is reaffirming,"" Wetterling adds. ""There are cases where nobody believed [the children] were coming home, and they did. This is one. So for me, it makes my heart smile. It's a success.""  Watch mom talk about hopes for son » . Both children -- Jaycee Dugard and Jacob Wetterling -- were 11 years old at the time of their abductions. Wetterling met Dugard's mother, Terry Probyn, on a television show -- ""it might have been 'Geraldo,'"" as Wetterling recalls -- shortly after Jaycee's disappearance, and they also spoke on the phone occasionally. ""It's just phenomenal,"" Wetterling says of Dugard's case. ""I know a lot of parents of missing children, and we all hope and pray that one day we'll get to hold our kids again. That's the goal."" Wetterling says she hasn't spoken to Probyn since her daughter's discovery because the media chaos has yet to subside and since the family undoubtedly ""needs some time, they need some space ... to heal."" But knowing that the Dugard family now has a chance to rebuild their lives does more than fuel her optimism for Jacob. It gives her reason to go to work every day. Since her son's kidnapping, Wetterling has turned being an advocate for families of missing children into a full-time job. After helping create the sex offender registry for Minnesota and subsequently for the nation, she helped build Team HOPE -- Help Offering Parents Empowerment -- a parent-to-parent mentoring program for mothers and fathers in similar situations. ""Most parents know nothing about child abduction, so when it happens you just scramble for what's out there,"" Wetterling says. She felt so strongly that children needed a bigger voice in government that she ran for Congress in 2004 and 2006. She lost, but not without garnering more than 40 percent of the vote each time. A secondary math teacher until just shortly before Jacob's abduction, Wetterling currently heads up the sexual violence prevention program at the Minnesota Department of Health in St. Paul. ""We're all seeking solutions ... some kind of protection, some kind of prevention work. So that's really where my energy flowed. 'How can we stop this from happening in the first place?'"" A large portion of Wetterling's job centers on ending social norms in television, video games and advertising that, she says, tolerate sexual victimization and in some cases ""sort of encourage it."" ""We [need to] collectively say, 'This is not OK -- you cannot sexually victimize.'"" Through the program's five-year strategic plan, Wetterling hopes to lower the numbers of children who become victims. But she says she'll also continue educating others and, specifically, urging people to report any peculiar behavior. For example, the case of Jaycee Dugard's is similar to many of the children who've turned up after being abducted in that the only reason they were found is because of ""somebody noticing something and calling the police."" With Dugard, it was a police officer who noticed something suspicious, and Wetterling urges everyone to be just as vigilant. ""These kids do not come running forward on their own. They are found by someone else,"" she explains. ""The bottom-line lesson is to tell people to report things when they see them. Trust your instincts ... You'd want somebody sticking up for your child, so don't second-guess. And call."" Wetterling described another example -- the case of a child taken from Wisconsin to a hotel in Texas. ""The maid in the hotel said, 'There's something not right about this relationship.' And the second time this girl was on 'America's Most Wanted,' the maid was watching and called the show. Within minutes [the child] was found."" An instance like that or Jaycee Dugard's could very well be what brings Jacob home someday. ""C'mon home, Jake,"" Wetterling says when asked what she'd tell her son in the event he sees this story. ""We never quit. We need you home. And to the man who took him: It's time. It's time to lift the burden that you've carried, as well, for all these years and tell us where he is and what happened. It's time.""","Patty Wetterling's son was kidnapped at gunpoint nearly 20 years ago .

"Massachusetts' highest court ruled Wednesday that it is not illegal to secretly photograph underneath a person's clothing -- a practice known as ""upskirting"" -- prompting one prosecutor to call for a revision of state law. The high court ruled that the practice did not violate the law because the women who were photographed while riding Boston public transportation were not nude or partially nude. ""A female passenger on a MBTA trolley who is wearing a skirt, dress, or the like covering these parts of her body is not a person who is 'partially nude,' no matter what is or is not underneath the skirt by way of underwear or other clothing,"" wrote Justice Margot Botsford of the state Supreme Judicial Court. CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin said the law has not caught up to technology and called it an assault on a woman's right to privacy. ""I think the courts got it wrong,"" Hostin said. ""The spirit of the law makes it clear it is about the person's privacy."" The ruling stems from the case against Michael Robertson, 32, who was arrested in 2010 and accused of using his cell phone to take pictures and record video up the skirts and dresses of women on the trolley, according to court documents. Two separate complaints were filed against Robertson with the transit police. Authorities then staged ""a decoy operation"" to catch Robertson, who was eventually arrested and charged with two counts of attempting to secretly photograph a person in a state of partial nudity. Police observed him point a cell phone video camera up the dress of a female officer, court documents state. Wednesday's ruling reversed a previous decision by a lower court, which had denied a motion by Robertson seeking the dismissal of the case, said a statement from the Suffolk County district attorney's office. ""In sum, we interpret the phrase, 'a person who is ... partially nude' in the same way that the defendant does, namely, to mean a person who is partially clothed but who has one or more of the private parts of body exposed in plain view at the time that the putative defendant secretly photographs her,"" the high court ruled. The ruling that state law ""does not apply to photographing (or videotaping or electronically surveilling) persons who are fully clothed and, in particular, does not reach the type of upskirting that the defendant is charged with attempting to accomplish on the MBTA."" Prosecutors had argued that the current statute, which prohibits secretly photographing or videotaping a person who is ""nude or partially nude,"" includes upskirting, according to documents. But Robertson's lawyers argued that the female passenger on the trolley was not ""nude or partially nude"" and was not in a place where she had a reasonable expectation of privacy, according to court documents. ""Every person, male or female, has a right to privacy beneath his or her own clothing,"" Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley said in a statement Wednesday. ""If the statute as written doesn't protect that privacy, then I'm urging the Legislature to act rapidly and adjust it so it does."" Robertson's lawyer, Michelle Menken, did not return a phone call seeking comment. Robertson faced misdemeanor charges punishable by up to two and half years in prison.

"An explosion rocked Kabul on Saturday, hours after the newly appointed U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel landed in the Afghan capital. At least nine people were killed and 14 others injured, police said. A suicide bomber apparently targeted the Afghan ministry of defense, said Charlie Stadtlander, ISAF spokesman. Hagel was not injured, and is in a safe International Security Assistance Force location, according to the U.S. military. He was in a briefing at the time and ""continued as planned without interruption,"" Pentagon spokesman George Little said. The bomber wearing a suicide vest approached the ministry on a bicycle, also laden with explosives, Kabul police said. He detonated near its gate. A Taliban spokesman claimed responsibility for the attack and expressed pleasure with Hagel's proximity at the time. The ISAF commander, Gen Joseph Dunford, disputed that the attack signified any alert by the Taliban to its reach. ""I'm not sure that I would accept that the Taliban knew the secretary was here in time to have planned that particular operation,"" he said. ""We've been extremely successful in preventing threats to Kabul. There has been violence, there are still people out there who want to conduct violence in Kabul, but I don't think this sends a message that the Taliban can do what they want to do when they want to do it. In fact, I'm confident they can't do that."" Hagel referred to the blast in comments to reporters and expressed condolences to the victims. ""I wasn't sure what it was,"" he said. ""I was in a briefing... but we're in a war zone. I've been in war. So, shouldn't be surprised if a bomb goes off or an explosion."" Journalists assembled at a separate location, Camp Eggers, heard the blast, which also shook the facility. No one was hurt. Minutes before the large explosion, they could hear other booming sounds. Attendees were initially moved to a safer location, but have since been released and are expected to continue with their scheduled plans. A loud speaker announcement at Camp Eggers informed the attendees: ""We are not directly under attack at this facility."" The camp temporarily went into lockdown mode. Camp Eggers and ISAF headquarters are within walking distance from the Afghan defense ministry. Small arms fire continued there after the blast, ISAF said. Hagel is the first Vietnam veteran to head the defense department.  He is in Afghanistan to thank the troops, he said, and ""to better understand where we are in Afghanistan."" Hagel met with rank-and-file troops -- the first time he had done so since assuming his post -- and awarded Purple Hearts to two soldiers, Pfc. Harry Hikes of Marysville, Washington, and Sgt. Jeremyah Williams of Sacramento, California. The defense secretary also presented coins to about 100 soldiers. He asked one soldier where he was from, to which the reply was Pine Bluff, Arkansas. ""Pine Bluff? I think I've got a bar bill there!"" Hagel said. During the trip, the defense department also reiterated U.S. support for South Korea in the event of military aggression from the North. Little also said that North Korea cannot unilaterally terminate the Armistice Agreement, according to legal language included in it. This is Hagel's first trip in nearly five years to the country that has been a theater of war for the United States longer than any other in history. On his last visit in summer 2008, he traveled with then-Senator Barack Obama. Hagel told reporters that he's known Afghan President Hamid Karzai for 11 years and he expects to talk with him about many topics, including the recent restrictions on U.S. Special Operations Forces. ""We're still at war in Afghanistan,"" he said, although it was never the United States' intention to stay indefinitely. Many in Congress, including several high-ranking members of his Republican Party, opposed Hagel's nomination; the final vote in the Senate was 58-41. Besides not liking his past comments about Israel and Iran, they bristled at his comments over the years about Iraq and Afghanistan, some of which came after the 2008 trip.","ISAF commander says Taliban still limited .

"(CNN) -- A U.S. Marine helicopter's emergency landing into the ocean in Hawaii killed one Marine and injured three others Tuesday evening, the Marine Corps said Wednesday. Two of the injured crew members were in critical condition in a Honolulu hospital, while the third Marine was in stable condition, according to the military. The CH-53D Sea Stallion helicopter, carrying four crew members assigned to Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron 363, landed in shallow water about two miles from the Marines Corps Air Station at Kaneohe Bay at about 7:20 p.m. Tuesday, it said. The three injured crew members were flown to Queens Medical Center in Honolulu.

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- Russia's new president Dmitry Medvedev wasted no time in knuckling down to work -- naming his predecessor Vladimir Putin as his new prime minister two hours after he was sworn in. Two months after winning the election, Medvedev, 42, was inaugurated as president Wednesday at the Kremlin before 2,300 invited guests in a ceremony with marching soldiers and military music. He became the third Russian president since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Within hours, Medvedev named Putin as prime minister, according to the ITAR-TASS news agency. Putin's new role and his position as head of the ruling United Russia Party raise questions about how much power Medvedev will actually have. The inauguration featured Putin almost as much as the new president. Putin delivered the first speech and stood just behind Medvedev when he was sworn in to his four-year term.  Watch as Medvedev is sworn in » . ""I fully understand the burden of responsibility that I will be shouldering,"" Medvedev said in his inaugural speech. ""I want to thank from my heart President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin for his invariable personal support that I have always felt, and I am sure that this will continue."" Medvedev won the March 2 election with an overwhelming majority but almost no campaign platform, said Oksana Antonenko of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. Now that Medvedev has taken office, his real work begins, she said. During his time in office, Putin created a network of loyal officials on every level of government -- all appointed, not elected. If Medvedev is to prove he is more than just a symbol of Putin's rule, he will have to start rebuilding those institutions, Antonenko said. ""He still has to prove that he has legitimacy and prove that he has the ability to govern independently,"" she said. In his speech, Medvedev emphasized building Russia's middle class, which represents 5 to 10 percent of the population. Antonenko said that will be one of the key ways for Medvedev to gain support. ""That's the only way for him to build a power base, because the middle class will support a rule of law, will support institutions, will support civil society, will support representational government,"" Antonenko said. Medvedev has little foreign policy experience, though he has already met with U.S. President George W. Bush and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, both of whom noted Medvedev's constructive tone, Antonenko said. Medvedev spoke of cooperation with other nations in his speech. The new president will inherit some lingering foreign policy headaches. Russia has been at odds with much of Europe over the recognition of Kosovo, the eastward expansion of NATO and the European Union, and U.S. plans for missile defense installations in Poland and the Czech Republic. ""There's no sign yet that Medvedev's angle on the eastward expansion of NATO and the EU is different from Putin. I am sure he is firmly opposed,"" said Charles Grant, an analyst at the Center for European Reform, a London think tank. Others believe Medvedev could be a pragmatist on the missile defense plans. ""If Russians have a way to verify and we really operate these bases jointly -- and we have a couple of other alternatives -- then we will all be OK and Mr. Medvedev, I think, will be perfectly happy with this arrangement,"" said analyst Igor Yurgens. Medvedev says he is committed to promoting democracy, fighting corruption, and bolstering the rule of law. But Kremlin critics point out Putin made similar promises when he ran, only to be criticized at home and abroad for cracking down on opposition groups. Like Putin, Medvedev grew up in the Russian city of St. Petersburg; both studied law and worked at the mayor's office. But unlike Putin, Medvedev never served in the Soviet KGB. He pursued an academic career and became a professor of law before moving into business and politics. ""He was always very intellectual, and in general he is from what we called the intelligentsia,"" said Marina Lavrikova, a former Medvedev classmate and colleague at the St. Petersburg School of Law. ""He was always goal-oriented, professional, and with very good organizational skills."" Medvedev also differs from Putin in his music tastes: He is a devout fan of '70s rock band Deep Purple, a far cry from the patriotic ballads Putin is said to enjoy. ""Dmitry belongs to a generation formed by liberal views, and he has always shown himself a genuine liberal,"" said Lavrikova. ""Here at the law faculty, there has always been this spirit of open-mindedness which was instilled in us. That's why, by and large, he's different from (Putin)."" Recent tensions between Russia and the former Soviet republics of Ukraine and Georgia are unlikely to be a big issue for Medvedev, who may take a more conciliatory tone than Putin, Antonenko said. ""For the Georgians and the Ukrainians, Medvedev is closer to what they seek for their countries -- he is a kind of post-Soviet man,"" she said. ""But (there is) the question of whether he will be able to develop this relationship against what appears to be a very hardline position from the Russian security community."" A Georgian minister said Tuesday that Russia's backing of separatist movements in Georgia is tantamount to provoking a ""war."" ""We literally have to avert war, because we see what is happening on the ground and we have all indications that Russia is trying to provoke Georgia to start war,"" Temuri Yakobashvili, Georgia's state minister of reintegration, told a news conference in Brussels.","Russia's new president Medvedev names Putin as prime minister .

"When you go to the polls for the midterm elections on Tuesday, there will be a good chance that your Facebook feed and your phone helped you decide how to vote. Cell phones and social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter are playing a bigger role in how Americans get their political information, according to a new survey from the Pew Research Center. Twice as many Americans used their phones to track information about this year's elections than did so during the last midterms four years ago. And there was an even bigger increase in the number of respondents who said they follow political figures on Facebook and other social media. In all, 16% of registered voters said they follow politicians on social media, compared with the 6% who said they did so in 2010. The leap has been even bigger among middle-aged voters. Of registered voters from 30 to 49, 26% said they follow politicians online and 40% of whom said they've used their phones to help keep up with news about the elections. For their part, social media outlets are embracing this expanded role in the political process. On Tuesday, Facebook will place a banner at the top of U.S. users' feeds reminding them that it's Election Day and urging them to share with friends if they've already voted. The shareable ""I'm a Voter!"" message, which Facebook calls a ""megaphone,"" is designed to stand out from regular News Feed fare. The banner also will link users to a webpage showing them where their voting precinct is located. ""Facebook's mission is to make the world more open and connected, and a part of that is helping the people who use our platform to more easily engage with the leaders who make the decisions that affect their lives every day,"" the company said in a written statement. ""In fact, although the megaphone has been available in the U.S. in elections in 2008, 2010 and 2012, for the first time ever this year, the megaphone was shown in elections internationally, including in India, Brazil and Indonesia."" In past elections, critics have complained that Facebook's testing of the megaphone tool -- for example, using the worlds ""I Voted"" on some and ""I'm Voting"" on others to see which had more impact -- could have an unfair impact on turnout. But Facebook says the tool has been thoroughly tested and that no ""research"" will be done on Tuesday. Twitter is also getting in on the voting-day action. The microblogging site had developed the #Election2014 dashboard, which lets users follow political tweets, connect with candidates and see what others are saying, including the ability to hone in on state-specific conversations. Twitter also will be sharing data it collects on users' political activity with media outlets for their election-night coverage. While online activism has been traditionally associated with younger and, by extension, more liberal voters, the Pew survey showed no strong ideological difference in behavior this time out. Republicans and Democrats participated in the behaviors noted in the survey at roughly the same rates. Voters from both parties said using social media and mobile technology makes them feel more engaged in the process and more connected to the politicians they support. Republican and Republican-leaning voters also said they like following politicians directly on social media because it allows them to skip the filter of traditional media outlets. The report is based on a national survey conducted October 15-20 among 2,003 adults (including 1,494 registered voters).","Facebook, Twitter playing a bigger role in this year's midterm elections .

"Barack Obama's father was more abusive and violent than the president was aware of, according to his half-brother, who has written a memoir about their father. Mark Obama Ndesandjo, who is several years younger than the President, described their father as a brilliant man. But he was also an alcoholic, a ""social failure"" and an abusive husband, he said. ""I remember the sounds of my mothers' screams and I remember the sounds of breaking, things breaking,"" he told CNN. ""And I remember that I couldn't protect her. That's something that no child ever forgets."" He said he especially remembered a violent episode when he was 6 or 7. ""My father actually broke -- came in the door, against the restraining order, and held a knife to my mother's throat,"" he said. Barack Obama apparently met their father once because his parents got divorced soon after he was born. Ndesandjo and the president have the same father, but Obama's mother was the second wife while Ndesandjo's mother was his third wife. Unlike Obama, Ndesandjo grew up with his father. The president is lucky he never lived with his father, according to David Maraniss, author of ""Barack Obama: The Story."" ""It would have been a much more difficult upbringing,"" he said. Divergent views of family history have caused some strain among Obama relatives, according to Ndesandjo. ""Barack I don't think accepts -- or at least does not want to know -- the details of the beatings that occurred in our family,"" he said. ""I love my brother. He's a great president. Sometimes he's a lousy brother."" The White House did not respond to e-mails and phone calls Thursday about the president's half-brother's book. But in a 2009 interview with CNN, the president said he was not blind to the flaws of his father. ""It's no secret that my father was a troubled person. Anybody who has read my first book, ""Dreams from My Father,"" knows that, you know, he had an alcoholism problem, that he didn't treat his families very well,"" he said. ""Obviously it's a sad part of my history and my background. But it's not something that I spend a lot of time brooding over."" Ndesandjo and Obama have several things in common: similar good looks, biracial ethnicity, the same father and each had an American mother. Despite their similarities, this is not the first time the two have been at odds. When they first met in Kenya in the 1980s, Ndesandjo was growing up there and trying to connect with his American roots, he said. At the time, Obama came from America and was ""really looking for that African side of him, and was trying to find more about himself and his identity. And I respect that. But I also felt that there was a rejection of a lot of Western culture,"" Ndesandjo said. ""I felt that my brother -- at that time - felt that I was too white,"" he said. ""And I thought he was too black."" When they first met, Ndesandjo said, his half-brother came on strong. ""That imposing voice, and also that commanding presence -- he was almost like a barracuda with his questions,"" Ndesandjo said. But even if their diverging views of the Obama family's history sometimes put the two siblings at odds, Ndesandjo said there were also things he was grateful for. His brother's example, he said, helped him re-embrace the Obama name that he had long shunned. And some years ago, when they met after 20 years of separation, they shared some good times. ""We laughed, and we hugged, and that was one of the most wonderful moments of my life. And Barack made it possible,"" he said. Ndesandjo, who lives near Hong Kong, hopes to raise awareness of domestic violence when the book is published in February. Some of the proceeds, he said, will go to his foundation for disadvantaged children.","""I remember the sounds of my mothers' screams,"" Mark Obama Ndesandjo says .

"Next up: the debt ceiling. The White House continues to issue dire warnings about the economic consequences should Congress fail to raise the debt ceiling this month. President Barack Obama told Wall Street to be ""concerned"" and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said Congress is ""playing with fire."" But despite all the drastic pronouncements, some Republicans in Congress aren't buying it. For one thing, they doubt that October 17 is the date when the Treasury will be unable to meet its obligations. Rep. Lee Terry, R-Nebraska, is one of those lawmakers. ""For him to just put out the 17th as a drop-dead date, I don't think there's a lot of credibility to that. I don't think a lot of my peers and I believe in that,"" Terry recently told CNN. Lew said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union"" that he has exhausted all of the ""extraordinary measures"" he employed when the debt limit was reached in May. ""I have no more. That means that on October 17th, we'll run out of the ability to borrow,"" he said. He said he will have only $30 billion to pay as much as $50 billion or $60 billion worth of daily bills. Lew also warned in a recent news release that default would be ""unprecedented and has the potential to be catastrophic."" He said: ""[C]redit markets could freeze, the value of the dollar could plummet, and U.S. interest rates could skyrocket, potentially resulting in a financial crisis and recession that could echo the events of 2008 or worse."" House Speaker John Boehner demands cuts for debt limit increase . But many conservatives doubt that, too. ""We don't expect there to be chaos,"" Terry said. Coming catastrophe or 'false demagoguery'? Rep. Steve King of Iowa recently called the threat of default ""false demagoguery."" ""I don't think the credit of the United States is going to be collapsed. I think that all this talk about a default has been a lot of demagoguery, a lot of false demagoguery,"" he added. The lawmakers' skepticism echoes a distrust of the government that runs deep in both liberal and conservative constituencies. But with a Democratic president, conservatives' skepticism is more pronounced. According to a September CNN/ORC poll, a slight majority of Republicans -- 52% -- said it would be a good thing for the country if the debt ceiling is not lifted while only 18% of Democrats said so. While Republicans are more skeptical of the Obama administration's posturing, the administration isn't totally sure what will happen if the debt ceiling is not lifted. When asked what would happen on October 18 if Congress doesn't act, Lew told CNN's Candy Crowley on Sunday that he ""can't tell you."" ""We've never gotten to the point where the United States government has operated without the ability to borrow,"" he said. There lies the central tenet. Because the United States has always lifted the debt ceiling when the borrowing limit was tapped, no one knows for sure what impact it would have. Constitution and the debt: Can the president go it alone? Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer of New York even said that ""no one's certain"" what the economic fallout would be. But he added on CNN's ""New Day"" on Monday, that ""no one should risk it and no one should say I want my political agenda attached to it."" But some conservatives are willing to take the risk and force the president's hand on the health care law and reducing government spending. A coalition of conservative tea party-aligned groups, including Freedom Works, Tea Party Patriots and Americans for Prosperity have spent more than a year cultivating a plan to push for the defunding of the health care law, the Affordable Care Act, according to the New York Times. As the stalemate over government funding has become interspersed with the debt limit fight, another log has been added to the fire. By the numbers: Shutdown and debt ceiling . Tempting fate or a bargaining chip? Republican Rep. Tom Cole said the debt limit should be used as a bargaining chip for less spending. ""Why would you pass a debt limit ... without doing something about the deficit?"" he asked rhetorically on ""CNN Newsroom"" on Monday. He pointed to the 2011 debate over the debt limit that reduced the deficit from $1 trillion to $700 billion. ""We're saying we should do the same thing now,"" Cole added. Additionally, some Republicans see the debt limit fight as an opportunity to not only shrink the size of government but also to pay off interest. Republican Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma said the United States could meet its obligations without lifting the debt ceiling. ""I would dispel the rumor that is going around that you hear on every newscast that if we don't raise the debt ceiling we will default on our debt,"" Coburn said Monday on CBS' ""This Morning."" ""We won't. We will continue to pay our interest. We'll continue to redeem bonds and we'll issue new bonds to replace those."" What Coburn doesn't mention is that the United States would have to choose to pay its interest over the billions of dollars of other obligations -- Medicare, Social Security, etc. -- for which the federal government is responsible. Lew, however, said that's a ""dangerous"" and ""reckless"" notion. ""[T]he reality is, there are no good choices if we run out of borrowing capacity and we run out of cash,"" he said. 4 debt ceiling scenarios freaking out traders . Most economists tend to agree with Lew's assessment. Moody's economist Mark Zandi told the Joint Economic Committee recently that the economy ""would quickly fall into another severe recession"" if the debt ceiling is not lifted in adequate time. Which side is right? Before default is reached, it's hard to know. But a recent study published in Psychological Science found that people on the far end of the political spectrum believe that their positions are ""correct."" ""Given the stalemate in Washington, understanding why people become so entrenched in their views â€” even when there is not an objectively correct answer â€” is more important than ever,"" Kaitlin Toner, a postdoctoral fellow at Vanderbilt University, said, describing why she conducted the study. Wall Street could be the biggest indicator of who is right in this fight. Investors nervous over the political impasse in Washington pushed all three major U.S. stock indexes lower on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average alone lost more than 130 points, or nearly 1 percent of its value.","W. House continues to issue dire warnings about consequences about debt ceiling .

"BBC TV presenter Jeremy Clarkson has asked forgiveness for using a racist term during a taping of his show ""Top Gear,"" after Britain's Daily Mirror newspaper brought a media storm by posting the footage online. Clarkson mumbled the n-word while reciting the children's nursery rhyme ""eeny, meeny, miny, moe"" to choose between two cars. That version of the take was never aired. Clarkson posted an online explanation Thursday in which he said he was ""begging for forgiveness"" -- and argued that he had done everything he could to avoid using the word. ""Ordinarily, I don't respond to newspaper allegations, but on this occasion, I feel I must make an exception,"" he said. Clarkson said that in filming the section a couple of years ago, he was very keen to avoid using the offensive term in a version of the nursery rhyme and mumbled it on two takes before replacing it with the word ""teacher"" on a third. ""When I viewed this footage several weeks later, I realized that in one of the versions, if I listened very carefully with the sound turned right up, that I had actually used the word I was trying to obscure,"" he said. ""I was mortified by this, horrified. It's a word I loathe, and I did everything in my power to make sure that that version did not appear in the program."" This included contacting the production office to ensure that another take was used in the show, he said. Clarkson initially denied the report by the Mirror, tweeting, ""I did not use the n word. Never use it. The Mirror has gone way too far this time."" But after the newspaper posted the footage in question online and amid calls from some quarters for his resignation, the presenter was forced to backtrack. He posted his video message less than 12 hours after his initial denial. A BBC statement said, ""Jeremy Clarkson has set out the background to this regrettable episode. We have made it absolutely clear to him, the standards the BBC expects on air and off. We have left him in no doubt about how seriously we view this.""

"Atlanta (CNN) -- A suspect accused of killing a Georgia police officer and wounding another one surrendered to authorities after a hostage standoff Friday night. The incident was shown live on television as officers arrested suspect Jamie Donnell Hood in Athens, Georgia. Hood, who was shirtless, emerged from the home a little after 11 p.m. with people whom authorities said he had held hostage. SWAT officers descended on Hood, ending the saga that had lasted four days. Hood was being held without bond Saturday in the Hall County Detention Center, Captain Eric Pozen of the Clarke County Sheriff's Office said. Hood was wanted in connection with Tuesday's slaying of Senior Police Officer Elmer ""Buddy"" Christian, 34, and the wounding of Senior Police Officer Tony Howard, 43. The shooting spurred a huge manhunt that climaxed when authorities learned that Hood was holed up in an apartment in Athens. Authorities said Thursday evening that Hood was holding eight people hostage and they were negotiating with him. At one point, authorities used the media to get a message to Hood. ""I want to commit to you, if you come out without a weapon, you will not be harmed,"" Vernon Keenan of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said in a televised address. Hood had asked negotiators to bring his mother to the scene, said John Bankhead, a GBI spokesman. During negotiations, Hood insisted that he be arrested on live television because he feared authorities would kill him, CNN affiliate WGCL reported. The incident began Tuesday afternoon on the east side of the city when a vehicle was carjacked, said Hilda Sorrow, a police spokeswoman. Hood, who was believed to be involved, was later seen as a passenger in a red SUV, she said. When Howard stopped the SUV, the man believed to be Hood got out and began shooting, police said. As the gunman ran off, he came across Christian's patrol car and fired into the vehicle, Sorrow said. The gunman eventually reached a highway and carjacked a Chevrolet Prizm, police said. It was later found abandoned, Sorrow said. Athens is about 70 miles northeast of Atlanta. CNN's Chuck Johnston contributed to this report .","NEW: Jamie Donnell Hood is held without bond .

Millions of us can be located immediately through technology in our handheld cell phones, but a 300,000-pound Boeing 777 with 239 souls on board disappears from the face of the Earth. NASA has the capability of photographing stars billions of light-years away, and yet our best minds are forced to guess where this plane might be. The airline industry has invested billions of dollars in technology that has made flight as incredibly safe as it is today. Yet many allow their aircraft to fall off any direct tracking capability as they fly over vast ocean distances and remote locations, confident that these planes will occasionally check in and reappear as they near the other side of the blacked-out area. But what if, as with MH370, they don't? It isn't like we weren't warned. Just five years ago, an Air France Airbus took off from Rio de Janeiro for a routine 5,700-mile trip to Paris. But the plane never arrived. Although the airline had received telemetric data that something was going terribly wrong and indicating in general where the plane had crashed, only the recovery of some large floating pieces of wreckage helped narrow the search area. Even after the search area was relatively quickly identified, the all-important flight recorders weren't recovered for another two years. Despite a series of well-founded recommendations by the BEA (the French counterpart to the National Transportation Safety Board), no meaningful reforms have been implemented. The International Civil Aviation Organization, the United Nations body that governs international aviation, has done nothing to order the tracking of transoceanic flights in real time and, in those very rare events when something goes wrong, to mandate equipment to ensure a successful search and rescue operation. This needs to end now. While there will undoubtedly be months and years of debate about next-generation capabilities, there are existing technologies and concrete actions that we can -- and must -- take right now to make sure this tragic spectacle is never repeated: . 1. All ETOPS aircraft (certified for extended overwater flight) need to be connected to a ""handshake"" monitoring service offered by Boeing, Airbus or the major engine manufacturers or to some other commercial service like the Automated Flight Information Reporting System that tracks the aircraft at all times. The ""handshake"" services can be limited in duration to reduce cost and to not overtax satellite capabilities. 2. Flight recorder ""pingers"" need to be upgraded to give off two distinct tones, one of which could be heard at a far greater distance than the other but would not need to sound as often in order to preserve power. Further, the batteries themselves should be immediately upgraded to last 90 days. 3. All ETOPS aircraft must be equipped with deployable black boxes, which would separate from the aircraft on impact. Not only does the device float, it transmits a signal that is picked up by the world's search and rescue satellites, providing the location of the black boxes for quick retrieval, the location of the aircraft at impact, its tail number and its country of origin. Had MH370 been equipped with a deployable flight recorder, the initial search could have been limited to within 3 miles of the impact, increasing in accuracy with every emergency locator transmission, rather than requiring the world's resources to search an area as large as the United States. The most difficult search in history . If these viable steps had been in place, the location of MH370 would have been identified many weeks ago, and secure, tangible black box data would be in hand to help us understand what happened during that ill-fated flight. Instead, we are only slightly better equipped to locate this airliner than when we were searching for Amelia Earhart 85 years ago. Unbelievably, the prospect of finding the plane seems more remote now than ever; a few weeks ago, Australia actually expanded the area it intends to search to the size of the state of Indiana, virtually guaranteeing that this will be the most costly search in history. And analysts have recently speculated that the basis for determining the search area may be completely without foundation. The embarrassment of this state of affairs for the industry and regulators is eclipsed only by the grief of the families of the 239 people who put their trust in an appallingly antiquated system governed by a hidebound international bureaucracy. The United States, one of the founding members of the International Civil Aviation Organization, needs to take a stronger hand in getting these common sense safety improvements adopted immediately. If the organization continues to dither, then the Department of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration must act unilaterally.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration confiscated a potent drug commonly used in lethal injections from a state correctional facility cache. Georgia Department of Corrections spokeswoman Joan Heath said the department contacted the DEA about its management of sodium thiopental, a powerful sedative. ""The department requested assistance from the DEA to ensure our handling of controlled substances is in compliance,"" she said in a statement. ""Because this is an ongoing regulatory matter, we will reserve further comment until the review is complete."" CNN did not receive a reply to an inquiry on how the correctional facility obtained the drug. The DEA seized ""a quantity"" of sodium thiopental Tuesday, and is now actively investigating the matter, spokesman Chuvalo Truesdell said. ""As such, DEA is currently working with the Georgia Department of Corrections to ensure that they are in compliance with federal regulations,"" Truesdell said. States that carry out lethal injections during death-row executions have historically administered a three-drug cocktail to carry out the process. Sodium thiopental is typically injected first to act as a sedative; the second drug paralyzes the inmate; the last stops the heart. Hospira, the only domestic manufacturer of sodium thiopental, stopped producing the drug in August 2009 because of a shortage of raw materials, a company spokesman said in December. The Illinois-based pharmaceutical company has said for years that it doesn't support the use of the sedative in lethal injections. ""Sodium thiopental was only made for medical use and to improve patients' lives,"" Hospira spokesman Dan Rosenberg said. The drug, sold under the name Pentothal, was intended to be made at the company's plant in Italy. But due to concerns with Italian authorities on the use of the drug in capital punishment procedures in the United States, Hospira announced in January it would stop producing sodium thiopental completely. ""Italy's intent is that we control the product all the way to the ultimate end user to prevent use in capital punishment,"" Hospira said in a statement. ""Based on this understanding, we cannot take the risk that we will be held liable by the Italian authorities if the product is diverted for use in capital punishment. Exposing our employees or facilities to liability is not a risk we are prepared to take."" The resulting shortage of sodium thiopental prompted 13 states to appeal to the Department of Justice in a letter early this year to question how the sedative could be obtained elsewhere, and whether the federal government would allocate some of its own supplies. ""Sodium thiopental is in very short supply worldwide and, for various reasons, essentially unavailable on the open market,"" the letter said. ""For those jurisdictions that have the drug available, their supplies are very small -- measured in a handful of doses. The result is that many jurisdictions shortly will be unable to perform executions in cases where appeals have been exhausted and governors have signed death warrants. ""Therefore, we solicit your assistance in either identifying an appropriate source for sodium thiopental or making supplies held by the federal government available to the states,"" the letter said. Some states have been substituting other chemicals. Wednesday, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice approved the use of pentobarbital on death row inmates, a powerful anesthetic more commonly used to euthanize animals. Pentobarbital is already being used by prison systems in Oklahoma and Ohio, spurring controversy. In December, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals allowed the substitution of sodium thiopental with pentobarbital in the execution of Oklahoma death row inmate John David Duty despite claims from his lawyers that pentobarbital was risky and unproven on humans. The court replied in an order, ""According to the record, sodium thiopental is now effectively unobtainable anywhere in the United States, thus requiring Oklahoma and other death-penalty states to revise their lethal injection protocols.""","Powerful sedative used in death-row executions now in short supply .

"DEKALB, Illinois (CNN)  -- A gunman dressed in black stepped from behind a curtain at the front of a large lecture hall at Northern Illinois University on Thursday and shot 21 people, five of them fatally, then shot and killed himself, said university president John Peters. Four died at the scene, including the shooter, and two later died at the hospital, he said. At least 22 people, including a graduate student who was teaching an ocean sciences class, were shot, Peters said. Seventeen victims were taken to Kishwaukee Community Hospital, its Web site said. Of those, six were in critical condition and were flown to other hospitals. One fatality, a male, was confirmed -- but was not the gunman, the hospital said. Two were admitted, and three others were discharged. The other five were not addressed on the Web site. Four of the fatalities were female, said Peters. Most of the injuries are head and chest gunshot wounds, a hospital spokeswoman told CNN. The gunman started shooting from a stage in the room shortly after 3 p.m. (4 p.m. ET) in Cole Hall, officials said. Police Chief Donald Grady said authorities do not yet know of a motive. They know the identity of the gunman but have not released his name, Grady added. The shooter was a graduate student at NIU in the spring of 2007. Currently he was not enrolled there but, Grady said, ""He may have been a student elsewhere."" Kevin McEnery said he was in the classroom when the gunman, dressed in a black shirt, dark pants and black hat, burst in carrying a shotgun.  See photos of the scene » . ""He just kicked the door open, just started shooting,"" said McEnery, who was in the class at the time. ""All I really heard was just people screaming, yelling 'get out.' ... Close to 30 shots were fired.""  Watch a student describe the chaos at the scene » . There are about 162 registered students in the class that met in the large lecture hall. A student described the classroom as having four exits - two at the front and two at the rear. ""Witnesses say someone dressed in black came out from behind a screen in the front of the classroom and opened fire with a shotgun,"" Peters said. At 3:03 p.m., NIU police responded, and four minutes later, the campus was ordered into ""a lockdown situation,"" Grady said. At 3:20, an all-campus alert went out via the campus Web site, e-mail, voice mail, the campus crisis hotline, the news media and various alarm systems, he said. ""The message basically was: There's a gunman on campus, stay where you are, make yourself as safe as possible,"" he said. Rosie Moroni, a student at the school, told CNN she was outside Cole Hall near the King Commons when she heard shots coming from the classroom she was heading to. The shot was followed by ""a lot of people screaming,"" then people ran out the doors yelling, ""He's got a gun, call 9-1-1,"" she said. ""It was complete chaos. It's very scary here right now."" By 4 p.m., DeKalb police had swept the area ""and determined there was only one gunman"" and that he was dead. Grady said the man used three guns: a shotgun, a Glock handgun and a small-caliber handgun, and was still on the stage when he turned one of the guns on himself. The small-caliber handgun has not been recovered, he said. The shooter started with a shotgun, then switched to a handgun, said Grady. A spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives told CNN that agents were on the scene, and could help trace the weapon or weapons used. Peters said the FBI is processing the crime scene and ATF was interviewing witnesses Thursday. Events and classes were canceled until further notice, Peters said. Seven counseling areas were set up throughout the campus, and hotlines were established. Security around campus was increased in December when police found threats scrawled on a campus bathroom wall that included racial slurs and references to last April's Virginia Tech shootings.  Learn about other recent school shootings » . One of the threats said ""things will change most hastily"" in the final days of the semester. Peters said there is no evidence that points to a link between the December incident and Thursday's shooting. Grady said it was unlikely authorities could have prevented Thursday's tragedy. ""As much as we do, it's unlikely that anyone would ever have the ability to stop an incident like this from beginning,"" he said. Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich declared a state of emergency, which will open the governor's disaster fund to reimburse local government entities for ""extraordinary expenses related to the response in NIU DeKalb"" and will allow the state Emergency Management Agency to provide assistance, the governor's office said in a statement.

"(CNN) -- Julianne Hough may have taken some heat for her Halloween costume, but those who know her say she didn't mean any harm. The actress-dancer-singer darkened her skin as part of her look when she attended a party dressed as one of the African-American stars of the Netflix series ""Orange Is the New Black."" Hough quickly took to Twitter to apologize once there was backlash. On Monday night competitors from her former show, ""Dancing with the Stars,"" stepped up to defend her. ""I know Julianne personally and none of the critique that she is getting at all relates to her as a person, period,"" dancer Val Chmerkovskiy told CNN. ""Whether it was a smart decision is a different conversation. But the intention, and going deep into the conversation of judging her character, of what she may or may not think behind the scenes -- that is absurd."" ""I know her as a person and she is kind and graceful ... and she has the right mentality. I just think it was a stupid mistake."" Her brother, Derek Hough, who also competes on the show, told E!

"The world's oldest known Holocaust survivor has died at age 110, her grandson told CNN Sunday. Alice Herz-Sommer, a talented musician and pianist, lived alone in her London flat, according to a 2014 Oscar nominated documentary about her extraordinary life. ""My world is music. I'm not interested in doing anything else,"" she said in ""The Lady in Number 6: Music Saved My Life."" Originally from Prague in what was then Czechoslovakia, Herz-Sommer was imprisoned at the Theresienstadt concentration camp during World War II. It was music that saved her. She and others performed concerts that entertained the Nazis. ""I knew that we will play,"" Herz-Sommer told the filmmakers. ""And I was thinking when we can play it can't be so terrible. The music, the music! The music is the first place of art. It brings us on an island with peace, beauty and love."" Theresienstadt was a ghetto-labor camp to which the SS deported and then incarcerated certain categories of German, Austrian, and Czech Jews, based on their age, disability as a result of past military service, or domestic celebrity in the arts and other cultural life, according to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Herz-Sommer ""grew up in a cultured and loving family which was part of the German-speaking Czech-Jewish assimilated society,"" the documentary's website says. Her mother was a playmate of composer Gustav Mahler and as a child Herz-Sommer often played with German-language novelist Franz Kafka who came to her home for Sunday lunch. Herz-Sommer was living in Prague when she received her deportation summons from the Nazis, the documentary site explains. Her mother and husband had already been transported to Auschwitz where they were gassed, the site says. Both Herz-Sommer and her 5-year-old son, it says, were sent to the Theresienstadt camp. ""As an adult Raffi had remarkably few dark memories of the camp,"" according to the filmmakers. The son said that his mother somehow ""managed to protect him from the worst realities of life at the mercy of the Nazis."" Herz-Sommer and her son returned to Prague after being liberated by the Soviet Army in May of 1945, according to the film. A clip on the site shows Herz-Sommer laughing, something she did a lot of in her later years. Her family surrounded her at her bedside before she died Sunday, her grandson Ariel Sommer told CNN. ""Much has been written about her, but to those of us who knew her best, she was our dear 'Gigi.' ""She loved us, laughed with us, and cherished music with us,"" he wrote.

"(CNN) -- American denialism threatens many areas of scientific progress, including the widespread fear of vaccines and the useless trust placed in the vast majority of dietary supplements quickly come to mind. It doesn't seem to matter how often vaccines are proved safe or supplements are shown to offer nothing of value. When people don't like facts, they ignore them. Nowhere is that unwillingness to accept the truth more evident than in the mindlessly destructive war that has been raging between the proponents of organic food and those who believe that genetically engineered products must play a role in feeding the growing population of the Earth. This is a divide that shouldn't exist. All the food we eat -- every grain of rice and kernel of corn -- has been genetically modified. None of it was here before mankind learned to cultivate crops. The question isn't whether our food has been modified, but how. Read more about Michael Specter at www.TED.com . I wrote ""Denialism"" because it has become increasingly clear that this struggle threatens progress for us all. Denialists replace the open-minded skepticism of science with the inflexible certainty of ideological commitment. It isn't hard to find evidence: the ruinous attempts to wish away the human impact on climate change, for example. The signature denialists of our time, of course, are those who refuse to acknowledge the indisputable facts of evolution. Nowhere has the screaming been louder, however, than in the fight over how we grow our food. If you are brave enough to set a Google Alert for the phrases ""genetically modified food"" and ""organic food,"" you will quickly see what I mean. The anxiety is certainly understandable. When it comes to food -- the way we produce it and particularly the way we consume it -- we have a lot to worry about. One third of American children are overweight or obese; for adults, the numbers are higher. Our addiction to mindless consumption has made millions sick and costs this country billions of dollars. The financial toll comes in terms of time lost at work and money spent treating and supporting people with diabetes, heart disease and many cancers, who, had they followed a better diet, would never have fallen ill. Nonetheless, better eating habits have nothing specific to do with organic food, which provides no nutritional advantage over more conventionally raised products. Opponents of genetically modified food constantly argue that it is unsafe. There has, however, never been a single documented case of a human killed by eating genetically modified food. If every American swallowed two aspirin right now, hundreds of us would die today. Does that mean we ought to ban aspirin? Of course not. It simply means that there are risks and benefits associated with everything we do and with every decision we make. When people say they prefer organic food, what they often seem to mean is they don't want their food tainted with pesticides and their meat shot full of hormones or antibiotics. Many object to the way a few companies -- Monsanto is the most famous of them -- control so many of the seeds we grow. Those are all legitimate complaints, but none of them have anything to do with science or the way we move genes around in plants to make them grow taller or withstand drought or too much sun. They are issues of politics and law. When we confuse them with issues of science, we threaten the lives of the world's poorest people. We are doing that now. By 2050, we are going to have 9 billion people to feed, a huge increase over today's 6.8 billion. It's not a figure about which there is much dispute. To feed that many will require nearly 50 percent more food than we produce now. It's not enough to simply say we waste food and consume too many calories, so that if we distributed it more intelligently everyone could eat just fine. Not in sub-Saharan Africa, where drought is nearly permanent. Many of those people subsist on cassava, the basic potato-like staple in the region. It lacks most protein, nutrients and vitamins. You cannot survive for long without them, so a team of international scientists funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, is engineering vitamins and micronutrients into cassava. They are engineering success into a failed crop. It will save and prolong many lives; that is farming and genetic modification at their best. Who could be opposed to that? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Specter.","Michael Specter says fear of science can have deadly consequences .

"Chuck Hagel's rocky and inauspicious path to leadership of the Pentagon could haunt him if he doesn't watch his step. ""If people feel Hagel makes a mistake in the future, they will come after him even harder than if this ugly process of recent weeks hadn't happened,"" said Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a co-author of ""Bending History: Barack Obama's Foreign Policy."" The former Nebraska senator's nomination as defense secretary was subject to harsh criticism from some fellow Republicans over past statements on sensitive political and national security matters. His shaky performance at his confirmation hearing and the subsequent fierce political wrangling over his selection and on unrelated matters did not help his case. But efforts to further delay his nomination were swept away on Tuesday as the Senate confirmed him, 58-41, with a handful of Republican votes in his corner. Hagel will be sworn in on Wednesday, succeeding Leon Panetta. President Barack Obama, a former Senate colleague, called Hagel a patriot who ""fought and bled for our country."" Obama said he will count on Hagel's ""counsel and judgment"" as the United States ends combat operations in Afghanistan and stays ""ready to meet the threats of our time."" The task for Hagel, 66, going forward is to swiftly move past the protracted nomination battle, prove himself a strong and capable Pentagon chief, and repair relationships on Capitol Hill, said Fran Townsend, a former homeland security adviser to President George W. Bush. ""Of course, when he walks through the door he is bruised and battered. But I think we shouldn't overestimate the impact of that,"" Townsend said. ""Frankly, once he is confirmed as secretary of defense and once he sits in the seat and takes on the mantle of responsibility, everyone in the Pentagon is going to stand up and salute smartly, as well they should."" Hagel, a decorated Vietnam veteran, said in a statement that he was honored to have been nominated and confirmed, and pledged to work closely with Congress to ""ensure that we maintain the strongest military in the world."" With Hagel's confirmation, Obama has put in place another crucial piece of his second-term national security team. John Kerry has been installed as secretary of state and John Brennan is awaiting Senate action on his nomination to be CIA director. Thomas Donilon is already serving as national security adviser. O'Hanlon said Hagel would not ""be damaged goods"" and the political outcry over his nomination would quickly be overshadowed by the latest budget drama engulfing Washington over spending cuts, which would hit the Pentagon hard, if enacted. Bad feelings about Hagel stem, in part, from his 2007 comments that the ""Jewish lobby intimidated lawmakers."" Republicans who are already uncomfortable with Obama's policies toward Israel are uneasy about a defense secretary holding such views. Israel's ambassador to the United States, Michael Oren, said in a statement that Israel ""looks forward to working closely"" with Hagel. Hagel's criticism of the Iraq War, the Patriot Act, and his past positions on Iran and on U.S. military intervention also raised red flags with his opponents. Moreover, he spoke about an ambassadorial nominee in the late 1990s as being ""openly, ggressively gay,"" remarks for which he has since apologized. Obama ended the prohibition on gays and lesbians serving openly in the military. And Hagel hasn't been sparing in his criticism of conservative and GOP figures, saying radio show hosts like Rush Limbaugh ""try to rip everybody down"" but ""don't have any answers,"" and labeling George W. Bush as callous on Iraq when he was president. Last week, 15 GOP senators sent a letter to Obama calling on him to withdraw Hagel's nomination. Arizona Sen. John McCain, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee and a fierce Hagel critic, did not sign the letter. But he led the charge against him in the Senate, stalling the nomination at one point in exchange for more information from the White House on the deadly September terror attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya. The real reasons why conservative groups are still going after Hagel . That sentiment gained traction in conservative circles. ""There is simply no way to sugar coat it. Senator Hagel's performance before the Senate Armed Services Committee was remarkably inept and we should not be installing a defense secretary who is obviously not qualified for the job and who holds dangerously misguided views on some of the most important issues facing national security policy for our country,"" said Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas. Vote no and send a message to Hagel . There was a healthy serving of politics behind the Hagel pushback, some experts say. He isn't the only potential member of Obama's first or second-term Cabinet to be grilled during the nomination process. At the start of his first term, Obama's pick to lead the Treasury Department, Timothy Geithner, emerged from a tough confirmation fight in the wake of recession to help push through Wall Street reform as well as the banking and auto industry rescues. His successor, Jack Lew, is expected to be confirmed. Some Republicans also believed that Hagel, like Susan Rice, was vulnerable in a divided political climate in Washington made more sharply partisan by Obama's re-election, according to experts. Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, withdrew her name from consideration for secretary of state after drawing heavy criticism from McCain and other Republicans over her public statements about the Benghazi attack. Democratic supporters of Hagel came to his defense this week as the vote drew near. ""The president wants him in the room as he's making important decisions. There's no question about his integrity of character. I think the president deserves to have the Cabinet he wants as long as the person is qualified,"" Missouri Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill said on ""Fox News Sunday."" The consternation over Hagel's confirmation has been ""kabuki theater,"" said David Rothkopf, editor of Foreign Policy magazine. ""The political divisions that dictated the pace and twists of his confirmation process pre-date him and will post-date his confirmation,"" Rothkopf said. ""The reality is that Hagel won't drive (defense) policy, the president and Hill politics will."" And time will heal even these political wounds, Rothkopf said.","Senate votes 58-41 to confirm former Nebraska senator, a Republican .

"(CNN) -- Lebanon dispatched troops Friday to quell clashes that arose in the city of Tripoli over the Syrian crisis. Prime Minister Najib Mikati said on TV that Lebanese army reinforcements went to two neighborhoods to ""put an end to what happened."" The clashes were between Lebanese Alawites who support the Syrian government and Sunni Muslims who oppose it. There also had been a large demonstration in Tripoli in support of the Syrian people. The clashes in Tripoli killed one soldier and three civilians and injured two soldiers and 10 civilians, the army said. Lebanon's National News Agency said one of those killed was an official with the Democratic Arab Party, an Alawite entity. ""I asked the military and the security forces to impose the law and order in the city and strike with an iron fist,"" said Mikati, who noted that authorities are investigating. ""I am not accusing anyone. We don't know who started the clashes,"" he said. ""The timing is suspicious, and the civil peace is a red line that no one can cross."" The Alawite faith is an offshoot of Shiite Islam that dominates Syrian leadership; Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is an Alawite. The majority of Syrians are Sunni Muslim. There's been tension between the two groups in Lebanon. Alawites and Sunni/leftist militias fought at various junctures during the 1975-90 Lebanese civil war until the Syrians established a presence there. The majority of the Sunnis in Tripoli loathe the Syrian regime, but the Alawites in northern Lebanon thrived during the Syrian presence.

"(CNN) -- Iran coach Afshin Ghotbi hailed his team after qualifying from the toughest group at the Asian Cup in Qatar, becoming the first team to reach the quarterfinals after beating North Korea on Saturday. Iran, seeking a record fourth title but first since 1976, followed up the opening 2-1 win over defending champions Iraq with a 1-0 victory in Doha thanks to a second-half goal from Karim Ansari Fard to go through with a match to spare. Iraq's chances of going through were boosted by a last-gasp 1-0 win over the United Arab Emirates in Saturday's second Group D fixture. The result left Iraq three points behind Iran on three, with North Korea and the U.A.E. on one. ""The qualification of our team, for me, is a fantastic accomplishment,"" Ghotbi, who moved to the U.S. in his teens and learned to coach there, told the Asian Cup website. An ominous sign ahead of the 2022 World Cup? ""Our group was the 'group of death' and I still believe it is the most difficult group in the tournament. To achieve this result two games in a row, I'm very proud of my players. ""Iran is capable of playing much better football. We will show that in the coming games. We will be fitter and more confident and hopefully you'll see much better performances from our team."" Ansari Fard, a 20-year-old striker, struck the winner in the 63rd minute from Pejman Nouri's cross after Iran struggled to break down the well-organized Korean defense. ""Playing North Korea is always difficult. They defend with numbers, they are organized, they are disciplined, they fight, they have pace and they are dangerous on the counter-attack,"" Ghotbi said. Socceroos deny South Koreans . Korea's best chance came when Hong Yong-jo's shot shaved the crossbar in time added on, leaving his team needing to beat Iraq in Wednesday's final round of matches. ""The next match is very critical for our team to go for the knockout stage but we will try our best,"" Korea coach Jo Tong-sop said. ""In terms of the system, we converted to 4-4-2 and we combine attack and defense, and in this way we created new tactics for our team. For the next match, I think we have to again put the emphasis on defense and try to score goals on the counter-attack."" The U.A.E. seemed set to have earned a second successive goalless draw until an own-goal by defender Walid Abbas in the third minute of time added on gave Iraq a much-needed victory. U.A.E. defender Hamdan Al Kamali headed against the post early on and striker Ahmed Khalil missed from close range, while Iraq hit the woodwork twice just before halftime through Nashat Akram and Qusay Muneer. Khalil smashed a shot against the bar after the hour mark, but the unlucky Abbas decisively turned the ball into his own net in injury-time as he tried to cut out a cross from Iraq captain Younis Mahmoud. ""It was a little bit lucky but at the end of the day we tried our best to force our luck in the game,"" Iraq's German coach Wolfgang Sidka said.

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- After four days of bloody mayhem, Kenyan security forces have ""ashamed and defeated"" the terrorist gunmen who had besieged Nairobi's Westgate Mall, President Uhuru Kenyatta said Tuesday. In a nationally televised address, Kenyatta declared his country ""bloodied but unbowed"" after the attack. ""We confronted this evil without flinching, confronted our deep grief and pain, and conquered it,"" he said. Five terrorists were killed in the fighting, Kenyatta said. Eleven other people had been arrested over possible connections to the attack. The victory came at a cost: at least 61 civilian deaths, six dead security officers and some 175 injuries. Sixty-two people remain hospitalized, he said. The Kenya Red Cross was reporting 62 deaths. The death toll may yet rise. The Red Cross said 65 people remain unaccounted for, and Kenyatta said three floors of the mall had collapsed, trapping some bodies. He did not explain the cause of the collapse, but fires and explosions had been noted at the upscale venue throughout parts of the last two days. 'Full accountability' Attention now turns to investigating the siege, the bloodiest terrorist attack in Kenya since the 1998 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi. Kenyatta said forensic teams were working Tuesday at the mall to find out more about the attack and its perpetrators, believed to be members of the Somalia-based Al-Shabaab terror group. Among their tasks would be determining the nationalities of the attackers, who had claimed to count Americans and other Westerners among their ranks. Kenyatta said he could not confirm reports that two or three Americans and a British woman were among the attackers. U.S. law enforcement sources said they were scouring intelligence reports for evidence of a U.S. connection, but a senior U.S. official said Monday the claim was looking less solid as they continued to investigate. Somali jihadists recruit in United States, Canada and Europe . The attackers include a woman killed early in the siege, a senior Kenyan government official told CNN. However, the official said, it is ""impossible"" based on the government's photo evidence (and before a forensics examination is complete) to determine if this woman is British-born Samantha Lewthwaite, as some have speculated. Kenyatta promised ""full accountability"" for the ""mindless destruction, deaths, pain, loss and suffering we have all undergone as a national family."" ""These cowards will meet justice as will their accomplices and patrons wherever they are,"" he vowed, pledging to work with international allies in a global fight against terrorism. Kenya is a key U.S. partner in battling Islamist terrorism and has also contributed military forces to an African Union expedition to fight Al-Shabaab forces in Somalia. It was in retribution for that mission that Al-Shabaab claimed it was staging the Westgate attack. Al-Shabaab grew amid Somalia's lawlessness . Kenyatta's address came at tend of a two-day stretch during which Kenyan authorities frequently claimed control over the mall despite continued sporadic gunfire and explosions coming from it. Tuesday morning, security forces said they were making final sweeps of the mall and dealing with explosives left behind by terrorists. How to help . The siege . The harrowing episode began midday Saturday in Nairobi when some 10 to 15 gunmen stormed the mall, shooting indiscriminately, according to witness accounts. Witnesses said the gunmen went from store to store, shooting people, and then took hostages. Mwagi Dorcas told CNN's ""New Day"" on Tuesday that she hid behind luggage in the mall's ground-floor grocery store, memorizing a Muslim prayer sent to her by family in a desperate bid to save her life should attackers find her. Al-Shabaab and some witnesses have said the attackers quizzed shoppers about their faith before deciding whether to kill them, releasing Muslims and targeting many others. ""I was praying the whole time,"" she said. ""I believed that, you know, if I got out, I would be rescued."" Some were spared despite not being Muslim. In one remarkable case reported by The Sun newspaper in Britain, terrorists spared a 4-year-old boy who confronted them, saying, ""You're a very bad man."" The Kenyan spirit cannot be broken, says eyewitness . Deaths . Most of the known dead civilians are Kenyans, authorities said. Six British citizens, two French nationals, two Indians and two Canadians, including a diplomat, also died, their governments said. Those killed include: . • Dutch national Elif Yavuz, a senior vaccines researcher for the Clinton Health Access Initiative based in Tanzania. Yavuz was pregnant and expecting her first child in October, said Julio Frenk, dean of faculty at the Harvard School of Public Health. ""Elif was brilliant, dedicated, and deeply admired by her colleagues, who will miss her terribly,"" the Clinton family said in a statement. • Yavuz's partner, Australian-British architect Ross Langdon, who moved to Nairobi to build sustainable architecture for Africa, volunteering to build hospitals and clinics free of charge. • Kofi Awoonor, a renowned African poet, author and Ghanian statesman. Awoonor earned his doctorate from New York's Stony Brook University and was a professor of literature there in the 1970s. • A nephew of Kenya's president along with the nephew's fiancee. • A Peruvian doctor, Juan Jesus Ortiz, who had previously worked for the U.N. Children's Fund and lived in Kenya doing consulting work. • Sridhar Natarajan, an Indian national and employee of a local pharmaceutical firm, and 8-year-old Paramshu Jain, the son of a bank branch manager, CNN sister network CNN-IBN reported, citing officials in India. • Roula Adatia-Sood, who was seven months pregnant, a colleague at East FM Radio station, Seema Manji, told CNN. The radio station was hosting a children's cooking competition at the time of the attack. Kenyan unity . In his speech Tuesday, Kenyatta praised Kenyans for turning out in overwhelming numbers to donate blood, for contributing money to victims and for helping in countless other ways. He said their example proved to the world the attack was a failure despite the immense loss of life. ""The incident which we now put behind was certainly not welcome,"" he said. ""Yet it has strengthened us and renewed our resolve to live as one strong, open, stable, democratic and prosperous republic where peoples of all races cultures and faiths pursue happiness together. ""Our attackers wished to destroy the essential character of our society,"" he said. ""They failed. Kenya endured. Kenya endures."" CNN's Michael Pearson reported and wrote from Atlanta.

"Two hours before the official results of the French presidential elections, no Paris visitor could ignore that a historical political change was about to happen. Down Paris' Left Bank boulevards, throngs of flag-waving young and not-so-young people were flocking towards the Socialist headquarters near the National Assembly. Cyclists were ringing their bells, cars blowing their horns and François Hollande's sympathizers chanting ""Victoire!""  Nicolas Sarkozy had just canceled a planned celebration at Concorde and the place, where the guillotine once stood, was alarmingly quiet and deserted. However, as is traditional in presidential elections, France waited for the traditional countdown at 8 p.m. sharp to see the face of their next president and to start celebrating or commiserating. With 51.7% of the votes, the Socialist candidate François Hollande won a neat victory, albeit not a large one. His first few hours as president struck a different tone to Sarkozy's victory in 2007. He addressed the nation from Corrèze, his regional bastion in the heart of France,and  his speech was then followed by accordionists playing ""La Vie en Rose."" He then hopped in a modest-looking car to reach the nearest airport and fly to Paris to go straight to the Bastille where 100,000 people waited until after midnight to hear him speak again. No flashy restaurant on the Champs Elysées, no celebrities behind him, no cortege of expensive cars: Hollande appeared as Mr. Normal from the first few minutes of his election. Here lies perhaps the key to his election. Unlike the rest of Europe, where governments collapsed under the euro crisis's burden, the French didn't sanction Sarkozy for his management of the financial crisis, which in fact many consider good. They ousted Sarkozy on his personality. In the last five years, they had grown to detest the man even more than his policies. The TV debate which traditionally puts the two candidates against each other just before the second round of the elections and which was followed by 18 million people showed the two men's strikingly different styles. Sarkozy appeared as the never-ending attacker who always tried to push his rival into mistakes. Hollande looked a much calmer presence who excelled both in ducking blows and holding his ground. If the street celebrations lasted till dawn in the streets of France, however, the honeymoon shouldn't last very long for  Hollande, who was already on the phone to German chancellor Angela Merkel an hour after being elected. His task is immense. First, he must reassure the markets while pushing for a growth pact alongside the already negotiated fiscal pact. He may not even wait for the traditional week before the official handover to start his presidency. His agenda for the next few days and weeks looks extremely busy. On May 17, Hollande must meet President Obama in Washington. The two men have never met and Hollande is an unknown entity in the U.S. The following two days, on May 18 and 19, Hollande will attend the G8 at Camp David and then on to the NATO summit in Chicago, where the French president will announce the earlier withdrawal of French troops from Afghanistan, an announcement which should not please the U.S. administration and Nato allies. In France, the next hurdle will come in a month when the newly elected president will ask the French to give him a clear majority at the National Assembly. A large majority would give the Socialist government room for maneuvering and real legitimacy when dealing with other European partners. At the Bastille yesterday, Hollande stated very clearly his intent to spear a new anti-austerity movement in Europe and the world at large. The challenge is momentous. He must first convince Merkel to let the ECB play a bigger part in the euro's recovery. Will Hollande succeed where Sarkozy failed? It is possible, after all. Merkel and Hollande may belong to two different political families; this detail alone never derailed the formidable entente between Mitterrand and Kohl. Besides, Hollande doesn't need being convinced that Germany is France's most important ally. In 2007, Sarkozy very openly snubbed Merkel, by looking instead towards the U.S. and Britain. Only circumstances made him reconsider. Merkozy was never a natural duo. At home, Hollande will start by making a few symbolic gestures: lower the retirement age from 62 to 60 for a fraction of the workforce, specifically those who started working in their mid-teens; he will raise students' scholarships; and stop the haemorrhage of teachers in the education sector, in his eyes, the most important battleground in France and the key to its future. These decisions are not going to deepen the public deficit much; they will however go a long way to signify that Sarkozysm is now extinct. And it is precisely what a majority of French people want to hear at present.","Francois Hollande appeared as Mr. Normal from first few minutes of his election, says Agnes Poirier .

"It takes Dr Gernot Groomer three hours to put on the spacesuit he hopes will, one day, walk across the surface of Mars. It's worth taking time when you're wearing a suit made from roughly 10,000 parts, designed for the most treacherous environment yet to be encountered by a human being. Groomer is the Austrian astrobiologist responsible for building a spacesuit for the Mars explorers of tomorrow -- and he's taking inspiration from armor worn by medieval knights. He explains that -- after the titanic effort required to get there -- simply surviving on the red planet will be a grueling battle. Mars: survival . Groomer paints a terrifying picture of an astronaut's view over the Martian landscape: abrasive particles of glassy sand, whipped into dust-storms (with wind speeds of 200kph/125mph); Galactic cosmic rays of radiation, with only the thinnest atmosphere to block it; temperatures plummeting to minus 130 degrees Celsius. It's an environment the enthusiastic scientist refers to -- without risking exaggeration -- as ""fairly"" hostile. Aouda.X:  a wearable spacecraft . In a small research facility -- nestled among the Alps in Innsbruck, Austria -- Groomer's team at the Austrian Space Forum are developing a suit to withstand the challenge. The result: a ""spacecraft to wear."" The 45 kilogram suit incorporates air and power supplies, communication devices, sensors to take biometric readings, and ventilation -- plus all the facilities required to allow the astronaut to eat, drink and (even) scratch their nose while away from base. No contact . It's a robotic creation with all the life-supports systems of a conventional spacesuit but with added capabilities needed to operate all alone on a distant planet -- where fast communication with earth is impossible. There, the suit will have to double as companion, adviser and mission control to the astronaut. It's 50% software, says Groomer: a built-in virtual assistant will be on hand to say ""be careful you're running out of oxygen"" or ""your next target is 2 kilometers away."" Staying tough . Wearing the Apollo-era suits sported by moonlanders, the Mars explorers would be ""very dead, very soon"", Groomer warns -- the suits being not nearly robust enough for the longer term missions they'll be expected to undertake across Mars' ""totally unforgiving"" landscape. The suits are designed to be repaired mid-mission but Groomer says he's also been looking to medieval armories for inspiration for the tough mars suits -- taking cues for the design of its upper torso from an armor suit he found recently. Watch: See how NASA spacesuits are tested . The smart suit . Groomeer's main concern, though, is not toughness. He and his team are caught up in a mini-Space Race: developing suits in competition with NASA and North Dakota University's NDX-2, MIT's BioSuit, and others. Where the other teams' suits are strongly focused on withstanding the physical strains of walking on Mars, Groomer claims his team's effort is the most intelligent: . ""The big difference in our suit is that we consider it as a central hub for an entire family of instruments,"" meaning the wearer can keep control of a robotic explorer vehicle and all the devices and sensors to be housed at the Martian base station. It might sound impressive, but the word Groomer keeps mentioning is ""safety."" The complex computer systems are as much as he can do to keep the astronauts of the future safe, 380 million kilometers from home. Watch the video above for more on the Aouda.X spacesuit.","Watch!

"Openly gay youths will be allowed to join scouting, a historic decision the Boy Scouts of America says will keep it unclouded by ""a single, divisive, and unresolved societal issue."" More than 60% of the group's 1,400-member national council voted Thursday at an annual meeting in Grapevine, Texas, for the change, which takes effect Jan. 1. ""No youth may be denied membership in the Boy Scouts of America on the basis of sexual orientation or preference alone,"" says the resolution. The BSA, however, will maintain its ban on gay adult leaders. ""The resolution also reinforces that Scouting is a youth program, and any sexual conduct, whether heterosexual or homosexual, by youth of Scouting age is contrary to the virtues of Scouting,"" the 103-year-old organization said in a statement after the vote. The BSA said there are no plans for further review of the issue. BSA President Wayne Perry said the vote came after ""an extensive dialogue within the scouting family (that) was exhaustive and ... very respectful."" ""No matter how you feel about this issue, kids are better off in scouting,"" Perry told reporters. ""Our mission is to serve every kid."" Reaction from interest groups to Thursday's vote was swift. The Human Rights Campaign said the BSA took a ""historic step forward."" ""Unfortunately, the new policy does not go far enough, leaving adult Eagle Scouts, scout leaders, and parents behind,"" the group said. Scouts for Equality and GLAAD lauded the BSA's ""commitment to creating a more inclusive organization."" Jennifer Tyrrell, an Ohio mother who was ousted as a den leader in April 2012 because she's lesbian, called Thursday's vote ""incredible."" Opinion: Boy Scouts' decision makes no sense . ""They've never been raised to discriminate against anyone regardless of sex or color or anything, so they can't understand why people care so much,"" she said of her children. ""... Definitely, one day, I hope they look back and think that we're part of something amazing."" Tyrrell, in an interview with CNN affiliate KTVT, said that the vote energized her for her next push -- to change Boy Scout policy so that gays and lesbian adults, like herself, can serve as leaders. ""When we used to exclude women from things, when we used to exclude black people from things, and that never has ever worked, but we continue to do it,"" she said. ""I'm going to be around to make sure that that's not the case. We're definitely not going to go away."" Conservative groups and some religious organizations argued against making any change in the membership policy, saying it would dilute the Boy Scout message of morality and potentially destroy the organization. John Stemberger, founder of OnMyHonor.net, which opposed the resolution, called the vote a ""sad day for Scouting."" Stemberger claimed that Boy Scout officials didn't foster a ""robust discussion,"" didn't provide ""honest information"" and ""hid information from the delegates."" He claimed that scouting groups now have two options: to ""segregate"" gay scouts from heterosexual ones by putting them in separate tents, or ""put homosexual boys with other boys and put them at risk."" ""We wouldn't put boys and girls sleeping together. Why? Because they're attracted to each other,"" Stemberger told reporters. The conservative Family Research Council tweeted: ""Sadly, the @boyscouts' legacy of producing great leaders has become yet another casualty of moral compromise."" BSA conducted a survey on the issue . The vote followed months of intense debate among interest groups and within the ranks of Scouting itself. In February, the Boy Scouts' national executive board postponed a vote on the issue and ordered a survey of its members. That survey showed an organization divided by age and, in some cases, by region. ""While a majority of adults in the Scouting community support the BSA's current policy of excluding open and avowed homosexuals, young parents and teens tend to oppose the policy,"" the survey said. Survey: Should gay and straight Boy Scouts share a tent? A BSA spokesman at the time called the issue ""among the most complex and challenging issues facing the BSA and society today."" ""The Boy Scouts of America will not sacrifice its mission, or the youth served by the movement, by allowing the organization to be consumed by a single, divisive, and unresolved societal issue,"" the group said after Thursday's decision. Chief Scout Executive Wayne Brock said, ""Our goal through all of this was to put kids first ... It allows us to serve youth who want to be part of scouting."" A long time grappling with a polarizing issue . The BSA for years has been at the center of the debate over gay rights. A recent Washington Post-ABC News Poll showed that 63% of Americans said they would support allowing gay youths to join the Boy Scouts. The vote comes more than a decade after the Supreme Court ruled that the organization has the right to keep out gays but also at a time of declining participation in the organization. Membership in Boy Scouts has declined nearly 20% since 1999.  About 2.7 million young people now participate nationwide. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, after the vote, said it will continue to work with the BSA. ""Sexual orientation has not previously been -- and is not now -- a disqualifying factor for boys who want to join Latter-day Saint Scout troops,"" it said in a statement. It was too early to tell what impact the decision might have on scout troops, and whether some families may join other organizations. The impending vote did spur action by a new organization called Faith Based Boys. Thomas Dillingham, an official from that group, said applications will be accepted starting in August for youth members and group leaders. ""Christian churches and organizations will use this program to continue serving God by training young men to have good character through service to their communities,"" Dillingham said Thursday. ""The profound need for a nationwide program like this has now been realized and the relevance of such a program will only become more important as time goes on."" Tico Perez, the BSA's national commissioner, said there have been ongoing talks with churches and others opposed to the inclusion of gay scouts. That said, he echoed other Boy Scout officials in saying they believe that Thursday's vote ultimately helps advance the cause. ""We're accepting youth,"" Perez said, ""and we're excited about where we are.""","Reaction to decision -- both positive and negative -- is swift .
Under rules, Boy Scouts will not exclude youths for sexual orientation .
The scouts will maintain a ban on openly gay adult leaders .
The policy will take effect January 1 ."
"François Hollande, the newly-inaugurated President of France, may be as notable for what he has not done as for what he has. He has never held national elective office despite being at the center of  French politics for more than a decade, and he has never been married despite a three-decade relationship and four children with Ségolène Royale, another of the country's top Socialist politicians. Hollande led the Socialist Party for 11 years and was leader when Royale ran unsuccessfully for president against Nicolas Sarkozy in 2007. Hollande and Royale split up a month before that election, and he is now seeing journalist Valérie Trierweiler, who appeared, smiling with him, as he celebrated his victory Sunday. He immediately spooked markets, and Germany, France's key ally in the European Union, with his victory speech. ""Austerity can no longer be something that is inevitable,"" he said, apparently undercutting the belt-tightening that his predecessor and German Chancellor Angela Merkel have urged on European countries beset by debt. Hollande emerged as his party's candidate for president after the downfall of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who was once considered the Socialist favorite to defeat Sarkozy. But Strauss-Kahn was arrested in May 2011 after a New York hotel maid alleged that he tried to rape her. Charges against the former IMF chief were later dropped in the United States, but he has been warned he could be investigated in France over accusations he participated in a prostitution ring. But Hollande was not an accidental candidate despite the way he has come to power, one commentator said. ""He's been preparing this campaign for 18 months now, much before DSK's demise,"" journalist Agnès Poirier said, referring to Strauss-Kahn. ""Some say that he knew, like actually many others in the party, that DSK was doomed: His colorful private life was always bound to prevent his running for president,"" Poirer told CNN before the final vote. ""In that respect, he's not a candidate by default. He's simply a less charismatic personality than DSK and less antagonistic than Sarkozy."" Born in 1954 in the northern city of Rouen, Hollande was the son of a doctor and a social worker. He was educated at the elite Ecole Nationale d'Administration, where he met Royale in 1978. Hollande has represented the southern Corrèze region in parliament since 1988 but has never held higher elective office than that post. The 57-year-old's electoral appeal is built around his affability, but the candidate was dogged during the campaign by questions from even within his own party about whether he has the charisma and decisiveness to be president. Hollande said: ""There's always a risk when the candidate becomes president: Will he deliver what is expected of him? ""It's a choice, it's always an important moment for a country because it has to choose between two risks: Either you keep the candidate who is on his way out or take the new candidate that we don't know. It's a gamble."" But after five years of Sarkozy's hyperactive presidency, during which time France's economic status has taken a knock, polls suggested voters were keen for a change from the president's flamboyancy. Before the first round of voting, former President Jacques Chirac added his support to Hollande, though Chirac was a center-right president, like Sarkozy. Chirac biographer Jean-Luc Barré told French TV channel BFM TV: ""He said last June that he will vote for François Hollande. ... He has said it a few times since and then again 10 days ago."" During the campaign, Hollande admitted that half of those who declare they will vote for him were primarily voting against Sarkozy. ""What the French want is coherence, stability and justice,"" Hollande said. ""If I am in a favorable position today, it's because my fellow citizens want to make the effort to straighten out the country, and at the same time they want it to be just and equitable -- no one left out of national solidarity and no one left out of the contributions which must be made."" To his critics that sounded as if Hollande wants to revive left-wing tax and social policies of the past, a view reinforced in the first speech of his campaign when he attacked the financial community. ""I don't want to drive the markets crazy, I don't want to create trouble but rather order and rules and norms. We have to struggle against financial excesses ... those who speculate with sovereign debt, those who develop financial products which have done so much harm,"" he said. But given the constraints of international finance and economic structures, observers said Hollande will not really have room to maneuver to shift France radically to the left. Hollande has been criticized for declining to spell exactly what his economic policies will be, although he has pledged to increase taxes on the rich, boost social spending and create thousands of state jobs. He has also vowed to renegotiate the eurozone fiscal agreement, but analysts said Hollande will likely be a pragmatic leader. Economy: Unspoken issue in election . The word one hears most often to describe Hollande's style is ""sympa,"" French slang for sympathetic, but his victory also owes a great deal to Strauss-Kahn's misfortune.","François Hollande has never held national elective office .

"The stated purpose for a meeting of pro-Hillary Clinton Democrats in New York on Friday was simple: Recap the last year and discuss 2014 lessons that will apply in 2016's presidential election. The much-talked about and more interesting purpose, however, was the realization that the pre-campaign that has existed around a likely Clinton candidacy for the better part of two years is soon coming to an end. In the hallway, ballroom and press briefing room of the Ready for Hillary National Finance Council meeting, dozens of top flight Democrats, many of whom would make up the roster of a Clinton campaign, came together to discuss the future of what appears to be a likely run. ""They are pretty certain,"" Stephanie Schriock, the president of Emily's List and a possible Clinton campaign manager in 2016, said when asked whether session attendees thought Clinton would run. Though many of the speakers at the strategy session regularly inserted caveats like ""if she runs"" or ""hypothetically"" into conversations with the press, the feeling of nearly everyone in the room was that Clinton is almost certainly running for president and will likely declare early in 2016. ""You can derive that by looking at what she has been doing,"" said Chris Lehane, the political director of Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign and a longtime Hillary Clinton adviser. ""I think she has been doing everything you would do if you were going to give a serious look to running."" Lehane added that the reason many of the Democrats were in a New York City ballroom on Friday was because of those movements by Clinton, who for the last year has headlined high profile speeches, stumped for Democrats across the country and written a much ballyhooed book. ""A lot of people are taking their signals from that,"" the California-based political consultant said. ""That is one of the reasons this gathering is taking place."" But just as certain as the attendees were that Clinton would be running in the near future, many were equally as certain that her campaign would face challenges and would have free reign of the Democratic field. Democrats openly worried about Clinton's campaign finding a message in a changing political landscape and holding on to a Democratic electorate that was burned by stinging defeats in 2014. ""If 2016 happens with a 2014 electorate, we are not going to be successful,"" said Mitch Stewart, a senior Ready for Hillary adviser and former Obama campaign aide. ""I think the big pitfall for Democrats is we have not yet figured out a message on the economy that resonates with working class voters. ... That is, for me, at least the biggest concern out there."" Strategists from important presidential states like Iowa and New Hampshire also raised concerns about her frontrunner status and their respective states' tendency to gravitate to fringe, dark horse candidates. ""Iowa has a very healthy contrarian spirit. It has a very healthy underdog spirit,"" said Jerry Crawford, a Clinton organizer in the Hawkeye State who joked that he sometimes has dreams (read: nightmares) of (independent Vermont Sen.) Bernie Sanders toying with a presidential bid. ""That is what we have to keep our eye on,"" he added. Similar concerns were raised by Terry Shumaker, a longtime Clinton confidant and aide from New Hampshire. ""Inevitability is not a message, it is not something you can run on. And in New Hampshire, we have a long history of (frontrunner) train wrecks,"" Shumaker said, noting that despite the Clinton's long history with New Hampshire, many young voters don't remember that. Shumaker, a longtime Clinton supporter who was with Bill Clinton when he filed his presidential bid papers in 1991, added: ""As I caution all presidential candidate in New Hampshire, taking New Hampshire for granted is very dangerous. Last time I believe Hillary Clinton had an almost 30-point lead in the polls in our state in the summer and that lead melted like an ice sculpture on the mall in Washington in July."" Clinton went on to win the New Hampshire primary in 2008, but by a slim 3%. But Clinton supporters were also buoyed on Friday by that fact that the Democratic field has been partially frozen for the last year because of their actions. Prospective candidates like former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley and Sanders have been entertaining bids, and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb declared this week he was launching an exploratory committee. But other than that, very few Democrats are lining up to take on Clinton and that was evident in the fact that many Clinton advisers on Friday looked more towards the general election than they did a Democratic primary. ""A tough thematic will be, 'a time for change,' and you can shove a lot under that thematic,"" said Harold Ickes, a Clinton friend who elevated Ready for Hillary when he signed on as an adviser. ""If (the Republicans) put up the right ticket -- and they've been known not to -- but if they put up the right ticket, it could come down to be very, very hotly contested."" Potential Clinton campaign staffers also lined the speakers list and hallways of Friday's event. Guy Cecil, the executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee; Schriock, the president of EMILY's List; and Ace Smith, a political operative who worked for Clinton in 2008, have all been rumored as likely picks for Clinton's top campaign job. Cecil and Smith avoided the press room altogether but sat on a panel in the closed press main ballroom, while Schriock spoke with reporters but wouldn't entertain questions about her future with a Clinton campaign. ""I'm not going to talk about any conversations I may or may not be having with a candidate who may or may not be running,"" the women's group leader stated emphatically to reporters. Not everyone was talking about future jobs, though. Craig Smith, a friend of Bill Clinton from his days in Arkansas, was quite gleeful when he thought about not working on another campaign. ""If she decided to run, and she wants me to do something, I will do what I can,"" Smith said with a smile. ""If she wants me to go to the beach and work on my garden, I will go do that.""","Supporters met to discuss the past year with nod to future Hillary Clinton presidential run .

"The grower was alarmed when the police helicopter swooped low over his property. Soon, Bartow County, Georgia, deputies -- ""strapped to the gills"" and with a drug dog in tow -- converged on his doorstep. They had the grower dead to rights. Except the plant that the chopper cops had spotted from the air was ... okra. Dwayne Perry of Cartersville told CNN affiliate WSB that he is none too happy about last week's ""raid"" conducted by the governor's drug suppression task force. ""Here I am, at home and retired and you know I do the right thing,"" Perry told the station. ""Then they come to my house strapped with weapons for no reason. It ain't right."" He received many calls about all of the police officers at his home, Perry said, and he worries that his reputation in the community may suffer. The helicopter was combing the area in search of cannabis plants when it came across the five-leaflet okra plant, the station reported. Marijuana plants can have anywhere between one and 13 leaflets per leaf, depending on maturity and health, but they generally have seven or nine. ""It did have quite a number of characteristics that were similar to a cannabis plant,"" Georgia State Patrol Capt. Kermit Stokes told WSB. Upon realizing that it had dispatched officers to confiscate a popular gumbo ingredient, the Georgia State Patrol, which operates the task force, issued an apology, both to Perry and publicly. ""If we disturbed them in any manner, that's not our intent. Our intent is to go out and do our job and do it to the best of our ability,"" Stokes told WSB. It seems like a humorous mistake, only because no one was hurt, but there have been numerous instances in which innocent citizens have been injured or worse when police acted on bogus information. That potentiality didn't escape Perry. ""The more I thought about it, what could have happened? Anything could have happened,"" he told WSB.","Cartersville, Georgia, man says police ""strapped to the gills"" came to his house last week .

"While the EU and the United States cheered a deal that world powers reached with Tehran over its nuclear ambitions, Israel was fierce in its criticism Sunday. ""What was concluded in Geneva last night is not a historic agreement, it's a historic mistake,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters. ""It's not made the world a safer place. Like the agreement with North Korea in 2005, this agreement has made the world a much more dangerous place."" ""For years the international community has demanded that Iran cease all uranium enrichment. Now, for the first time, the international community has formally consented that Iran continue its enrichment of uranium."" Washington said the changes called for in the agreement will make Iran less of a threat to Israel. ""We believe very strongly that because the Iranian nuclear program is actually set backwards and is actually locked into place in critical places, that that is better for Israel than if you were just continuing to go down the road and they rush towards a nuclear weapon,"" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told CNN's State of the Union. Netanyahu disagreed. The deal, Netanyahu argued, leaves Iran ""taking only cosmetic steps which it could reverse easily within a few weeks, and in return, sanctions that took years to put in place are going to be eased."" ""This first step could very well be the last step,"" he said. ""Without continued pressure, what incentive does the Iranian regime have to take serious steps that actually dismantle its nuclear weapons capability?"" Mark Regev, a spokesman for Netanyahu, said easing pressure will remove any motivation for Iran's leaders to make difficult decisions. ""It's like having a small hole in your tire, a small hole in the sanctions regime,"" he said. ""In the end, like with your tire, you'll get a flat."" Obama discusses deal with Netanyahu . U.S. President Barack Obama tried to ease the close U.S. ally's concerns on Sunday, calling Netanyahu to discuss the deal. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Obama focused on conveying a key point: The United States remains committed to closely consulting with Israel throughout the negotiations with Iran. The roughly 30-minute conversation between the two leaders was a ""useful discussion,"" Earnest said. ""The President underscored that the United States will remain firm in our commitment to Israel, which has good reason to be skeptical about Iran's intentions,"" the White House said in a statement describing the phone call. Obama also stressed that the United States and Israel share a common goal, making sure Iran never obtains a nuclear weapon. Kerry: 'Very little relief' for Iran . Kerry argued that the deal will make Israel safer by freezing some Iranian nuclear development and removing its stockpile of uranium enriched to 20% purity. And he said the sanctions part of the agreement is hardly a boost for Iran. ""There is very little relief. We are convinced over the next few months, we will really be able to put to the test what Iran's intentions are,"" Kerry told CNN chief political correspondent Candy Crowley. The deal says that the U.S. will provide $6 billion to $7 billion in sanction relief -- just a drop in the bucket compared to the roughly $100 billion in foreign exchange holdings that are inaccessible to Iran because of sanctions, the White House says. Iran insists its nuclear program is purely for civilian purposes, with no long-term goal of developing a nuclear weapons arsenal. But such assurances haven't quelled sharp skepticism from Israel. ""If in five years, a nuclear suitcase explodes in New York or Madrid,"" said Naftali Bennett, the Israeli minister of trade and industry, ""it will be because of the agreement that was signed this morning."" Shimon Peres, Israel's president, sounded a different note. ""This is an interim deal. The success or failure of the deal will be judged by results, not by words,"" Peres said in a statement. ""I would like to say to the Iranian people: You are not our enemies, and we are not yours. There is a possibility to solve this issue diplomatically. It is in your hands. Reject terrorism. Stop the nuclear program. Stop the development of long-range missiles. Israel, like others in the international community, prefers a diplomatic solution. ""But I want to remind everyone of what President Obama said, and what I have personally heard from other leaders. The international community will not tolerate a nuclear Iran. And if the diplomatic path fails, the nuclear option will be prevented by other means. The alternative is far worse."" Spokesman: Israel reserves the right to defend itself . To be sure, there is no love lost between Iran and Israel. Iran, which in the past has questioned Israel's right to even exist, continues to push Israel's buttons with incendiary statements. Israel, which says it has the most to lose if Iran develops a nuclear bomb, has repeatedly warned the West to tread warily when dealing with Tehran. So finding that their greatest ally, the United States, has struck an interim deal with Iran brought condemnation from Israeli lawmakers. ""Israel cannot participate in the international celebration, which is based on Iranian deception and the world self-delusion,"" said Yuval Steinitz, minister of strategic and intelligence affairs responsible for international relations, and a member of the Knesset. Lawmakers stopped short of saying whether Israel would go it alone militarily, if the need arose. But Israeli officials told CNN's Ian Lee they would not rule out a strike against Iran -- and Netanyahu certainly didn't mince words. In a written statement, he said Israel ""is not obliged to the agreement."" ""The regime in Iran is dedicated to destroying Israel and Israel has the right and obligation to defend itself with its own forces against every threat,"" he said. ""I want to make clear as the prime minister of Israel, Israel will not let Iran develop a nuclear military capability."" Israel bombed a reactor construction site in Iraq in 1981. Asked by CNN's Wolf Blitzer about the possibility of an Israeli airstrike on Iran's nuclear facilities in the next six months, Netanyahu's spokesman didn't rule out that option. ""We, of course, would like to see a diplomatic solution. We'd like to see a peaceful dismantling of the Iranian nuclear program. If that can be achieved, that's obviously preferable,"" Regev said. ""But Israel always reserves the right ... to defend ourselves, by ourselves, against possible threats."" Israeli leaders 'sleep with one eye open' It's hard for most Americans to understand why all Israeli prime ministers are said to sleep with one eye open, said Aaron David Miller of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. He was a Middle East negotiator in Democratic and Republican administrations. America, he says, has ""nonpredatory neighbors to its north and south and fish to its east and west."" Israel, on the other hand, is a small Jewish state surrounded by antagonistic Muslim neighbors. ""I don't think Iran wants nuclear weapons to launch a first strike against Israel. But it's impossible to ignore, let alone trivialize, Israeli security concerns and vulnerabilities in this regard, particularly in the face of Iran's rhetoric, regional ambitions and support for terrorism over the years,"" he said. Indeed, the verbal attacks have been relentless. Even as the P5+1 met in Geneva, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei unleashed another volley last week in Tehran. Khamenei said Israeli officials ""cannot be even called humans"" and referred to Netanyahu as ""the rabid dog of the region."" When Iranian President Hassan Rouhani described the deal on Sunday, widows and children of slain Iranian nuclear scientists stood nearby as he addressed them in his speech. Iranian officials have long accused Israel of planting bombs under the scientists' cars, and analysts have argued that's a likely scenario. Israel generally refuses to comment on accusations and speculation. After one such attack killed an Iranian scientist last year, Israeli military spokesman Brig. Gen. Yoav Mordechai said in a Facebook post that he didn't know who'd targeted the scientist. ""But I certainly didn't shed a tear,"" he said. Once a 'honeymoon' What is often forgotten in this tense relationship is that it wasn't always this way. After the birth of the nation of Israel in 1948, it and Iran enjoyed a ""honeymoon"" that lasted until just before the 1979 Islamic revolution, David Menashri, professor emeritus of Tel Aviv University, told CNN last year. Israel's ties with Iran were chiefly motivated by ""a single word with three letters -- O-I-L,"" he said. But the Islamic revolution that overthrew the Shah of Iran marked a turning point. The Islamic Republic, led by Shiite clerics in the predominantly Shiite nation, saw Israel as an illegitimate state with no right to exist, certainly not amid Muslim nations. Despite harsh rhetoric, though, then-Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini ""didn't want to get into a confrontation with Israel,"" said Ervand Abrahamian, a professor of Iranian and Middle Eastern history at Baruch College of the City University of New York. One reason: Israel and Iran had a common enemy in Iraq, a country that fought an eight-year war with Iran. Israel even supplied weapons to Iran to help it fight. In the years after the Iran-Iraq war, however, Israel began to regard Iran and its support of global terror as a chief threat. And it watched uneasily as Iran has gained influence in the Middle East since the first Gulf War began eroding Iraq's power. Those concerns escalated when international inspectors found traces of highly enriched uranium at a power plant in Iran in 2003. In the escalating conflict, the United States has always said, in the words of Obama last year, that it has ""Israel's back."" ""The United States has no stake in concluding an agreement with Iran that leaves Israel angry, aggrieved and vulnerable. So, the two sides will find a way to work this through,"" Miller said. ""But for now, buckle your seat belts. We could be in for one bumpy ride."" How to enrich uranium into fuel .","White House: Israel ""has good reason to be skeptical about Iran's intentions""

"Interrogators don't expect to have it easy with Ahmed Abu Khatallah, a Washington law enforcement official told CNN. The suspected mastermind of the 2012 attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya, has had time to rehearse his story, the official said. But an expert who has interrogated al Qaeda operatives thinks there's a good chance Abu Khatallah will crack, if interrogators punch the right buttons. Others have done so before him. ""Some were motivated by the uncertainty of the situations. Others were motivated, as they called it, (by) fatigue with the jihad life,"" former Navy intelligence agent Robert McFadden said. What's next? The capture . Months of intelligence research went into Abu Khatallah's capture, Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Wednesday night. Then U.S. Special Forces slipped into Libya by sea over the weekend to nab him. With FBI agents by their sides, the Special Forces operatives headed to a villa south of Benghazi, a senior law enforcement official said. There, they set a trap and lured Abu Khatallah. He fell for it, and they delivered him by boat to the USS New York. They also confiscated some ""media"" at the villa, which investigators will scrutinize. High seas 'a good place' Interrogators from the FBI-led High Value Detainee Interrogation Group are on board the ship. Taking Abu Khatallah by sea, rather than by air, is giving them ""maximum time to question him,"" U.S. officials said. The high seas are a good place for it to happen, McFadden said. ""It really is quite conducive to good interviews."" ""The main thing is to get the detainee, the subject, to a safe environment with a minimum of distractions."" First they'll let a doctor check him over to make sure he wasn't injured when he was captured. That should go quickly and easily, he said. Khatallah only wrestled with U.S. forces briefly. Not a shot was fired when they captured him. After the medical, it's time to meet the interrogators. McFadden says they should prioritize information that improves national security, like tips that help disrupt plots. They should also get a roster of terrorist players and the lowdown on how they communicate. Logistical reasons . The sea transport is also being done for logistical reasons. The United States would have a hard time finding countries in the region willing to allow the ship to transfer a prisoner snatched in an operation such as this. The Libyan government has decried his capture as a ""kidnapping"" that violated its territorial sovereignty. Libyan Justice Minister Salah Marghani said the United States is still a friend of Libya's, but he called for U.S. officials to loop his government in before carrying out such operations. The Libyan government asked that the United States guarantee the suspect's safety and rights. Human Rights Watch joined that call Wednesday, asking that Abu Khatallah get access to a lawyer and appear promptly before a judge. They demanded he receive a fair trial. About that trial . Once the USS New York has neared U.S. shores, officials will put Abu Khatallah into a helicopter and fly him onto land. The Obama administration has said he will face a federal trial, a position at odds with some of the President's Republican critics, some of them calling for Abu Khatallah to be incarcerated at the U.S. military detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Prosecutors have had a lot of success with terror trials in U.S. civilian courts. Aspiring Times Square bomber Faisal Shahzad, the so-called underwear bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, radical cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri and al Qaeda propagandist Sulaiman Abu Ghaith -- all were convicted and sentenced in U.S. courts. And they are but a few examples. By contrast, there have been a mere handful of Guantanamo convictions. Abu Khatallah might tell the court the same story about why he was at the U.S. mission the day a mob attacked it, killing Ambassador Christopher Stevens and IT expert Sean Smith. ""I didn't know where the place was,"" he told CNN last year. ""When I heard, we went to examine the situation. When we withdrew and there was shooting with medium guns, and there were RPGs in the air and people panicked, we tried to control traffic."" But U.S. investigators have collected evidence against him for two years, and the accused will be tried on three charges in federal court that include killing while attacking a federal facility and material support of terrorism. A formal indictment is around the corner, U.S. officials said, and it will include some new charges. Opinion: Why U.S. raid in Libya is a sign of hope . Opinion: Why Benghazi issue won't go away .

"From a small office in downtown Kabul with views of the snow-capped mountains in the distance, a man sobs as he stares at a photograph pinned to the chair of where his uncle used to sit. ""Where are you, Sardar? You will never come back. What should we do?"" pleads Taraj Ahmad as tears roll down his face. Until a few days ago, this was the workplace of Sardar Ahmad, one of Afghanistan's most prominent journalists, who was a senior reporter for Agence France-Presse. The 40-year-old father of three was sharing a meal with his wife and children at Kabul's luxurious and heavily fortified Serena Hotel last Thursday night, celebrating Norwuz -- the Persian New Year -- when four gunmen opened fire in the restaurant. Hotel staff say that when the young militants dressed in traditional garb pulled out their pistols, Ahmad's wife pleaded with them to kill her and not her family. Instead, at point-blank range, they shot all of them in the head, killing Ahmad; his wife, Homaira; their 6-year-old daughter, Nilofar; and their 4-year son, Omar. The only survivor is 2-year-old Abuzar, who is in a coma with gunshot wounds to the head. ""Four days ago, Abuzar was playing on my lap. Today, he is in a coma. But I'm praying that he will also die. What's the point of him living?"" cries Taraj Ahmad, Sardar's nephew. ""If he survives, what do I tell him? That his family was all murdered? But this baby is a fighter. That's why he's still alive. Sardar will live on in him."" The brutal attack that claimed nine lives -- four of them foreigners -- raises serious questions about the state of security in Afghanistan's capital, with a presidential election less than two weeks away. Authorities are still trying to work out how the insurgents were able to get past security and metal detectors with the pistols and ammunition concealed in their socks and shoes. But the Taliban, which claimed responsibility for the shooting, have vowed to use force to disrupt the April 5 election. Suicide bombings are increasing around the country, and earlier this month, Swedish journalist Nils Horner was gunned down in broad daylight on a busy street in the capital. ""Two weeks ago, Sardar was talking to his friend about the Swedish journalist. He was very saddened by his murder,"" Taraj Ahmad said. ""He told his friend, 'What if we face such a day and lose our life in such a cowardly attack?' He would think, 'If I'm killed, what will happen to my family?' Two weeks later, he's killed. It's unbelievable."" Ahmad was a passionate journalist who cared deeply for his country. He had family members living in Canada who encouraged him to leave Afghanistan and move overseas. But he wouldn't hear a word of it. ""He'd tell us it wasn't time to leave, that there was still so much work to do to improve Afghanistan,"" said Esmat Kohsar, who worked in the same office as Ahmad. ""He was so kind and had so much love for this country and for journalism. He wanted to make a difference; he had big dreams. He wanted to improve Afghanistan. It wasn't his time for him to die; this country needed him. This is the biggest shock for us."" With a heavy heart, trying to hold back tears, Kohsar said, ""I felt like my father died. I was just wishing that I had died instead of him. This country is worse off now that Sardar Ahmad is no longer in it."" Afghanistan attack: AFP reporter among 9 dead in Kabul hotel .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The California fertility doctor who implanted a dozen embryos in Nadya Suleman, resulting in the birth of eight babies, will lose his medical license on July 1, state officials said. The California Medical Board ruled that Dr. Michael Kamrava committed ""gross negligence"" with ""repeated negligent acts, for an excessive number of embryo transfers"" into Suleman in 2008. Suleman -- known in the media as ""Octomom"" -- was 33 when she gave birth to eight babies in January 2009. She was a single woman who already had six young children conceived through in-vitro fertilization administered by Kamrava. Kamrava, who began treating Suleman in 1997, said Suleman demanded all 12 embryos that were available for the procedure. The doctor ""did not think he could refuse to transfer less embryos than those to which N.S. would agree because he believe at the time that the ultimate decision should be largely driven by the patient's wishes,"" the board wrote in the decision released Wednesday. ""While the evidence did not establish (Kamrava) as a maverick or deviant physician, oblivious to standards of care in IVF practices, it certainly demonstrated that he did not exercise sound judgment in the transfer of 12 embryos to patient N.S. (Suleman),"" the board wrote. His lawyer argued during a hearing last October that Kamrava has been ""a respected, excellent physician and surgeon for 25 years,"" but that he ""ran into sort of a perfect storm with one of his patients."" Kamrava was also found guilty of gross negligence in two other cases, including his treatment of a woman on her late 40s who became pregnant with quadruplets after he implanted seven embryos. Her pregnancy was ""rocked with complications,"" according to the medical board. Another case was a missed cancer diagnosis for a patient with an abnormal lab report. It was revealed during Kamrava's revocation hearing last October that Suleman still has 29 frozen embryos in storage available for her use should she want more children. The complaint said the doctor should have referred Suleman to a mental health physician after she repeatedly returned to him for treatments shortly after each of her pregnancies. Kamrava, an obstetrician/gynecologist in Beverly Hills, California, was expelled from the American Society for Reproductive Medicine in 2009 for what the fertility medical society called ""a pattern of behavior that violated the group's standards."" The society recommends implanting no more than two embryos for women under 35 and no more than five for women over 40 -- who have more trouble getting pregnant -- according to guidelines published on its website. Giving birth to extreme multiples comes with tremendous risks for the mother and the babies, including ""complications with pregnancy, prematurity and long-term consequences of that,"" Dr. Victor Fujimoto, an expert witness called by the medical board, testified. Suleman's children -- six boys and two girls born nine weeks premature -- all went home after an extended stay in the hospital. While there has been no indication any problems have emerged, ""we still don't know,"" Fujimoto said.","State medical board rules Dr. Michael Kamrava committed ""gross negligence""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The future of design could see the divide between able-bodied and disabled people vanish. A toilet for all: the ""Universal Toilet"" caters for able-bodied and people in wheelchairs. Don Norman , design Professor at Northwestern University in Illinois, and the author of ''The Design of Future Things,'' is issuing a challenge to designers and engineers across the world: Create things that work for everyone. ""It is about time we designed things that can be used by ALL people -- which is the notion behind accessible design. Designing for people with disabilities almost always leads to products that work better for everyone."" Once the champion of human-centered design -- where wants and needs of individuals are the primary consideration in the design process, Norman now believes accessible activity-centered design is a better approach. This approach creates designs by looking at the job a person needs to achieve in using a particular technology. Norman told CNN that including disabled people in this thought process would create better technologies for all people, regardless of their level of ability. ""Make cans and bottles that a one-handed person can open and guess what, many people will find it makes their lives easier when they only have one free hand. ""Showers and baths can be made better and safer for all. Make things better for the hard of hearing or seeing and guess what, similar benefits for all,"" he said. And technology like this is already being developed. Korean designers Changduk Kim and Youngki Hong have come up with the ""Universal Toilet,"" an invention that could end the need for separate able-bodied and disabled toilets. Tell us your ideas for machines or objects that could be adapted to suit disabled and able-bodied people. Despite such innovation, Norman said there would still need to be a shift in the mindset of many major companies. ""The most important first step is to increase the awareness of designers and companies of the need to accommodate everyone. The disabled are not just some small, disenfranchised group: they represent all of us. So the first step is education, awareness, and empathy."" A change in the thought process of designers would also require support and active participation of people with the disabilities being designed for, he said. Norman also hoped for some more care to be taken with these designs. ""Finally, why are so many aids so ugly? Why can't we rally the design community to make beautiful, elegant canes, walkers, wheelchairs, and other items?"" Such an approach would aid the work of organizations like the Disabled Living Foundation, and Alison Wright's British company EasyLivingHome, which specializes in inclusive interior design to meet the functional and aspirational needs of older consumers. Norman felt some of the best designs in existence were simple and very old. He believed computers are actually restrictive when it comes to being creative. ""Pencils and small pieces of paper are two of the best objects designed. When you take our computer tools they don't allow us such flexibility. The good technologies are bringing that flexibility back."" He said producing good designs was about making the object understandable, and not trying to base the design on a certain way in which people should use the technology. ""What we should do is understand the job the person is trying to do. Don't try to predict what a human will do. You will get it wrong,"" he said. Some of Norman's favorite technologies of the contemporary era include the Nintendo Wii, navigation systems in cars, and Google Maps with the option of being able to select driving or walking. He is not a big fan of the iPod's design, and believes it has been successful primarily because of excellent marketing, the iTunes store, and other extras which can be bought to accompany the iPod. Norman was also supportive of users of technology could have input into how it functioned. He said 'mass customization' where designers offer the purchaser the opportunity to add a personal touch to goods was increasingly common. ""I think it's quite rewarding letting people design their own things."" So, what does he see occurring in the future? Norman said he was excited about 3D printing and the possibilities that could one day open up. ""I can imagine in the future if I was after something like a new dish-mat, I will be able to buy it online and by printing it it gets manufactured in my own home."" He envisaged being able to purchase the raw materials for such items and then input them into the machine.","Professor of design Don Norman wants designers to be more inclusive .

"LONDON, England -- (CNN) -- Ross Lovegrove is a world-famous industrial designer renowned for combining cutting edge, organic and sustainable designs with the newest manufacturing technologies. Lovegrove (left) and Craffonara with a prototype of the designer's ""alpine capsule,"" which is transparent on the inside and has a mirror on the outside. For his latest project, Lovegrove has teamed up with restaurateur and club owner Moritz Craffonara, who dreams of having a ""bed under the stars,"" nestled on the peaks of the Dolomite mountains. Reflecting Craffonara's passion for nature and art, Lovegrove has designed an ""alpine capsule"" which will rest atop Craffonara's private mountain. CNN joined Lovegrove and Craffonara in Italy, to explore the ideas behind the design for the unique concept of creating a ""bed under the stars."" CNN: How did this project come about? Ross Lovegrove: Moritz commissioned me to create the alpine capsule. He is a bit of a legend in this area. This whole mountain top where I am sitting is owned by Moritz. At the age of 22, he started bringing all the wood up the mountain on his own back. He is now in his early 60s and he looks younger than me, he is somebody who is a great example of what fresh air can really do for you. He has been running his lodge for all those years and now that he has some money available and he has decided to invest in something that could be a complete stimulus for a new way of thinking on the planet. Moritz leads the perfect life. He often gets in his little plane and flies to Venice for a coffee in St Mark's Square. That's a very good life style. CNN: What is the Alpine Capsule and how it will work? RL: The Alpine Capsule is a very typical idea about the way we might be able to live off grid. It's the idea that you can have an autonomous environment which can provide all the comforts you need, all the warmth and all the water you need, but absolutely off grid.  Watch Lovegrove explain the concept » . It is a habitation that is completely transparent from the inside so you can see nature around you and the stars. From the outside, the capsule is a mirror that reflects the surrounding nature. It is meant to provide the experience of being warm and cozy and at the same time being one with the vast universe. It would be quite remarkable if at 4 o'clock in the morning you can leave this pod, it can open like a private jet, and you could walk about on the snow privately and see the stars. What do you think of the Alpine capsule? CNN: Where did your inspiration for the design come from? RL: I tried to bring the kind of autonomous habitation systems that exist on a space craft and bring them back to earth. The shape of the capsule looks like a space object, that's why I called it the Alpine Capsule. But it's not as synthetic as you would think. My capsule is the most adaptive statement to date. You can put it anywhere because it is fundamentally an alien. CNN: Do you think the capsule's aesthetic will fit into its environment? RL: It is indeed an alien mirror-like feature. But it actually is not an invasive thing, its something that we have gotten used to, like seeing an aircraft in the sky. The capsule looks like a mercurial drop. Also, I think the traditional buildings in the Alps, built from wood, are very beautiful. They work in total harmony with their environment and I'm not looking to interfere with that at all. It's worse for me to look to design a hybrid type of structure that's trying to tastefully fit in. It would be worse for me to cover my building in wooden shingles. Ironically that would be more visible than what I am proposing. What I think is extraordinary, and this is my dream, is the idea that instead of creating a log cabin or a stone cabin, you produce a spaceship that has been dropped into that environment. So if you come back to something like the alpine capsule, in this simplicity and you lie on this irregular shaped bed, you don't have any references back to the life that you know. Maybe you can play incredible classical music or something that is going to stimulate your senses and you marvel at this 360 degree view around you. I could not think of a better way of getting up in the morning. My dream would be that Maurice gets inundated by people who want to experience this construction, when it is built in two years' time. CNN: What does the capsule represent? RL: For me the capsule is a metaphor of the future, because it's not only about the pollution and over-population of cities, it's about experiencing the planet. I live in London and I absolutely gasp for good air and here at the top of a mountain it feels perfect; the air feels perfect for my body temperature, the light in my eyes means that I can see things better than I can normally see things. The work that I do with nature is to heighten one's perceptions and to heighten one's senses. We have been increasingly detached from nature I think that we need to relocate. CNN: What attracted you to this project? Being a designer today at any level is a dream job; you have an opportunity to bring something into this world that has never been seen before. If you do that in the right way you can completely transform people's energy levels. People seem to transform into children when you show them incredible ideas like this. You don't need to be able to speak a language with design, the design itself can unite cultures, it can unite global ambitions. Our human life span is sort of out of sync with nature's life span. In terms of the creative benefits for me as a designer, I'm interested in the concept of being a visionary. I think you have to try and visualize the future and push it forward. We need to understand what we learn in the future, I have always said that design is an educational process and as a designer I make sure I learn from a project and increase my knowledge base.","Famous designer Ross Lovegrove talks about creating the 'alpine capsule'

The bed will be built within a couple of years according to the designer, who hopes that it will attract people from all over the world. See  some of Ross Lovegrove's designs. » . Placing a seemingly incongruous space-age pod on a mountain top in the middle of the Alps is something Lovegrove has no qualms about doing. He said: ""In areas like this where they predominantly build from wood and you see the very old buildings, they are very beautiful, they work in total harmony with their environment and I'm not looking to interfere with that at all. It's worse for me to design a hybrid type of structure that is trying to tastefully fit in."" For him, the capsule is part of what he calls ""a new nature,"" -- a man-made situation ""that brings in the positive aspects of man's material and technological potential."" ""I'm interested in developing an aesthetic for the 21st century which comes from the intelligent use of resources, materials and structures,"" he says. Away from his client work, one of Lovegrove's projects is the ""Car on a Stick,"" an electric bubble car that turns into an elevated streetlight at night. This style typifies Lovegrove's methods of blending organic inspiration with a fresh approach to function, cutting-edge manufacturing technologies. In the early 1980s, he worked on the Sony Walkman and and the Apple iMac and over  his long and varied career, has worked with a wide range of influential clients including Airbus Industries, Peugeot, Issey Miyake,  Tag Heuer, Herman Miller. Above all, the common theme of Lovegrove's design is the passion that imbues them.","Industrial designer Ross Lovegrove is known for his organic, flowing forms .

Stapp, who earned worldwide fame in the late '90s and early 2000s with songs like ""With Arms Wide Open"" and ""Higher,"" alleged he was under ""some kind of vicious attack"" because the funds in his bank accounts were stolen by people he knows or frozen by the IRS. In the video, he detailed how he had to sleep in his truck for a couple of weeks and, at one point, didn't have enough money to eat for two days.
