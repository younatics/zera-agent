Google has now stepped in to take down the image - which was revealed to anyone typing the name of Tameside General Hospital in Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire, into the search engine. The haunting picture of the personification of death had been created and uploaded to a blog carrying critical articles about survival rates at the hospital, which serves a population of 250,000. Shock: Patients looking up Tameside General Hospital in Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire, on Google were given a nasty surprise when searches returned a picture of the Grim Reaper outside the building . It then managed to rise to the top of Google’s ranking system for searches for the hospital - which is based on web traffic and the keywords used in image captions. A Google spokesman admitted the image, which was automatically-generated when searching for the hospital, had been ‘inappropriate’ and confirmed it had now been removed from its image database. She said: ‘The images you see in our information panel come from the web and are the same as the images you see in search results. ‘In this particular case, we have now updated the panel with a more appropriate image. All of our panels include a link so you can tell us when we may have an inaccuracy in our information.’ Death rates: Between October 2011 and September 2012, 18 per cent more patients at Tameside General Hospital in Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire, died than would be expected at a similar hospital . Last month a two-day review of death rates at the hospital was carried out as part of the Keogh Review - which is looking at potential failings at 14 hospital trusts. Between October 2011 and September 2012, 18 per cent more patients at Tameside died than would be expected at a similar hospital. The investigation was launched following the Mid-Staffordshire scandal, where hundreds of patients died needlessly due to poor care. The results of the inspections, lead by government health chief Sir Bruce Keogh, will be made public later this year - although hospital managers will be told immediately of anything of serious concern. A spokesman for Tameside General Hospital declined to comment.","Image revealed to anyone typing Tameside General Hospital on Google .

A conman, who showered his girlfriend with gifts using money stolen from her own account, was jailed yesterday. Adam Lloyd-Harris told Janine Munroe that he was a wealthy music executive and bought her  flowers, gifts and trips. But the 32-year-old was funding his pretence of a lavish lifestyle by stealing almost £18,000 from his trainee nurse girlfriend. Adam Lloyd-Harris siphoned £18,000 from Janine Munroe's during their seven-month relationship . Ms Munroe said their relationship had been 'idyllic' but did not realise she had been paying for the gifts herself. He was jailed for 17 months yesterday but Ms Munroe, 35, said the sentence was a 'disgrace'. She said: 'I am angry he will be free again to walk into the arms of his next victim.' Lloyd-Harris, 32, 'constructed a fantasy world' when he met Ms Munroe, telling her he was a record executive for Sony when he was actually unemployed. The pair were together for seven months until she became suspicious in September 2009 and asked him to leave her home. It emerged he had accessed her debit and credit cards that she had left in the house and then hidden bank statements to try and cover his tracks. But she discovered the bundle of mail addressed to her before they split up. Prosecutor John Brennan told Newcastle Crown Court: '[Lloyd-Harris] told her he had a job at Sony. 'When she made contact with Sony they said he never worked there and told her she was not the only person to have been in touch about him.' Lloyd-Harris used Ms Munroe's debit and credit cards to lavish her with presents and then hid her statements to try and cover his tracks before she eventually became suspicious . Lloyd-Harris was suffering from a depressive illness when he stole the money, the court was told . Yesterday, he was sentenced to 17 months in jail but due to time already served he could be out within weeks. Ms Munroe, of Ryhope, near Sunderland, said: 'He is nothing but scum. I have lost four years of my life because of him. I am angry to think that he could soon be doing this to someone else, which you can guarantee he will. 'But at least, for me, this is now over and tomorrow I start a whole new chapter in my life.' Lloyd-Harris, formerly of Peterlee, admitted theft and fraud charges in December 2011 after conning Janine of the money she was saving to go to university. But he failed to turn up at court - and convinced police to release him twice - on the basis he was suffering from a kidney disease. The court heard how Lloyd-Harris hid . Janine’s bank statements when the couple lived together at her . Sunderland home so she did not become suspicious. He took her on holiday to Berlin where he splashed out on luxury gifts and treats. Judge James Goss QC told Lloyd-Harris at Newcastle Crown Court that he had 'constructed a fantasy world' Mr . Brennan told the court: 'All of this was paid for by the complainant . Janine Munro, not that she was aware of this at the time.' The court heard Lloyd-Harris kept up a pretence of being a high-flying, wealthy executive during the relationship. Judge James Goss QC told him: 'You constructed a fantasy world to mask your failure to cope emotionally and maintain your reputation of affluence. 'You told lie after lie. You secreted her post in order to maintain the charade that was taking place. 'It was very manipulative behaviour.' Jamie Adams, defending, said Lloyd-Harris was suffering from depressive illness as well as physical ailments at the time. Mr Adams said Lloyd Harris did not spend the stolen cash entirely on himself. He said: 'It was actually to keep the myth by way of a facade that he was in employment.'","Adam Lloyd-Harris, 32, siphoned thousands of Janine Munroe's account .

Britons are consuming more so-called legal high chemicals than any other nation in the European Union, according to the latest research by the United Nations. A total of 670,000 people aged 15 to 24 have experimented with the substances, which imitate the effects of illegal drugs, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said. UK use, which accounts for nearly a quarter of the EU total, led Poland, France, Germany and Spain in the top-five countries. UNODC executive director Yury Fedotov has urged action to prevent the manufacture, trafficking and abuse of legal highs in the office’s World Drugs report. Health risk: Legal high use is increasing at 'unprecedented levels' according to a UN report which showed the highest consumption in the UK . The UNODC warned that the substances are rapidly increasing at an 'unprecedented rate' and 'posing unforeseen public health challenges'. For the year to April 2011, official figures showed that the most widespread legal high was mephedrone; however, its use fell after it was banned as a class B substance under the Misuse of Drugs Act. Mephedrone turned out to be the third most abused substance after cocaine, on a par with ecstasy, the report said. Last month, the Government’s drugs tsar warned that Britain is being swamped by a 'potentially dangerous' influx of legal highs. Professor Les Iversen, chairman of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD), said he and his colleagues cannot keep tabs on all the substances available as there are now around 200 such chemicals flooding the European market. Risks: The UNODC report has warned increasing use of such unknown substances risks 'posing unforeseen public health challenges' Mr Iversen told a public hearing that dealers are dodging laws by dressing the drugs up as plant food and warned that overdose risks are 'clearly immense'. He said the ACMD, which reviews substances and advises whether measures should be taken for preventing misuse, would be focusing on a man-made amphetamine called Benzo Fury and new LSD-like chemicals. Crime Prevention Minister Jeremy Browne said: 'The UK is leading the global effort to address the serious threat from ""legal highs"", adapting and innovating as new trends emerge. 'We have introduced temporary class drug orders, a swift legislative response to protect the public while our independent experts prepare advice. 'We are working with law enforcement agencies overseas to break down supply chains and reduce demand. 'We have led a new G8 agreement to share intelligence on ‘legal highs’, the impact they have on public health and their supply routes. 'Our Forensic Early Warning System and the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs continue to closely monitor the prevalence and availability of these substances. 'We remain vigilant to the threat and committed to removing harmful substances from UK streets.'","Around 670,000 young people have tried out so-called 'designer drugs'

A fugitive conman who is though to have fled to the Costa Del Sol has had two properties seized by police seeking to retreive some of the £300,000 he made in financial scams. Tony Murphy, who is also a known associate of a notorious drug dealer, travelled around the world to Egypt, America and Thailand on holidays while raking in thousands from credit card, loan and mortgage cons. Despite tax records showing he declared just £2,232 earnings over six years, Murphy, 40, managed to fund a lavish lifestyle. Tony Murphy, who raked in thousands from credit card, loan and mortgage cons, has had two of his properties seized . He also bought two homes, one in Urmston and the other in Hale, both in Greater Manchester, and kept up the mortgage payments. The two properties, along with cash found at the homes, were subject to a confiscation Order after a Proceeds of Crime Act hearing at Minshull Street Crown Court to the value of £121,099. Patrick Goodrich, of Operation Bank, a multi-agency unit which investigates organised crime, said the hearing showed how they would relentlessly pursue criminals. He said: 'We will get the money back through the sale of his assets. These two houses were the proceeds of organised crime. 'Essentially, what we are saying is that these homes were connected to organised crime gangs. When you look at the history of these houses you can see that. 'This has weakened that gang. It also teaches criminals that we are relentless in our pursuit of them and their assets and we will use different tactics in our power to get to them.' Murphy travelled around the world to Egypt, America and Thailand on holidays despite tax records showing he declared just £2,232 earnings over six years . Mr Goodrich said this was the culmination of an intensive two-year investigation. He added: 'But we are willing to work for that long for something that is valuable to our communities - and these organised crime gangs are a blight on our communities.' When officers raided Murphy’s homes last year, they found pictures of him posing with animals during a trip to a foreign zoo and paragliding in Egypt. Murphy (dressed as a gangster in a picture found by police at his home) fled before his sentencing in February and is now thought to be hiding out in Spain . They also found passports filled with stamps of the countries he had visited. On his walls were posters of Robert De Niro in Scarface. Murphy, from Hale, pleaded guilty at Manchester Minshull Street Crown in January and July last year to two counts of fraud, four counts of obtaining a pecuniary advantage by deception and one charge of acquiring criminal property. But he fled before sentencing and is now thought to be hiding out in Spain. He was sentenced in his absence in February to two-and-a-half years in prison. The court heard that despite being unemployed, Murphy secured credit cards, a mortgage and loans by creating different professions for the accounts. Murphy bought the house in Hale for £225,000 and the other in Urmston, for £90,000. He got a secured loan on the Urmston house and four credit cards by lying on his applications and admitted handling £30,000 of cash which was gained through crime. During Operation Bank's investigation of Murphy, they discovered he knew convicted drug dealer James Maxwell, in part through a picture of the pair together found in the police raid. Maxwell, 35, is serving a 22-year sentence in a US jail for importing and possessing and conspiring to supply ecstasy. Detectives want any ex-pats in Spain who recognise Murphy to call 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.","Tony Murphy funded a lavish lifestyle while raking in thousands from cons .

A gay immigrant who was jailed for eight years after a series of 'extremely violent' attacks will not be deported because he is now straight. Naushad Saboor successfully argued he should stay in Britain because 'his sexual orientation was transformed from homosexual to firmly heterosexual'. The Sri Lankan was sent to prison at Snaresbrook Crown Court in London 11 years ago for two counts of GBH after he lost control after a series of homophobic comments were made. Changed man: Naushad Saboor will not be deported after he went from gay to straight, despite being jailed at Snaresbrook Crown Court (pictured) for eight years in 2002 . But after his release from jail in 2007 . he was no longer gay, and married a British . woman and they had a child together. Angry: Tory Philip Davies said the decision by judges to allow the Sri Lankan to stay in Britain was 'perverse' At the same time he applied for asylum, which was rejected because he had shown 'no remorse' for his crimes. But after launching an appeal using European human rights rules, he successfully argued that being kicked out of the UK would deny him the right to a family life. The Home Office then appealed the decision but incredibly Mr Justice Clive Lane backed Saboor instead of the Government, despite admitting his story that he went from gay to straight lacked credibility. Tory MP Philip Davies has called it a 'perverse decision to allow a dangerous foreign criminal to stay in our country'. 'As far as I'm concerned the human rights rules and laws in our country and our judges are both as daft as each other,' he said. 'The combination of the two gives us these ridiculous judgements. 'It is these cases that prove we need top scrap it. It seems that the only people who seem to use it are prisoners and illegal immigrants.' The Home Office said cases like this one is 'precisely why we are looking to change the law in the new Immigration Bill this year'. Excuse: Foreign criminals have frequently used European human rights law to prevent them being deported . It came as yesterday an illegal immigrant who was jailed for beating his children was told he cannot be deported because it would breach his right to a family life. Antonio Alfredo Bazomba, 49, was sentenced to two years in prison for kicking and punching his two sons and a daughter. But an attempt by the Home Office to have him deported following his sentence has been rejected because he is a changed man and now has a good relationship with the children he attacked.","Naushad Saboor was jailed after attack prompted by homophobic abuse .

A young mother 'died from deep vein thrombosis' three weeks after she gave birth through an emergency caesarean, an inquest heard. Maxine Nour, 24, from Hanwell, west London, gave birth on August 16, 2011 but complained to her husband of shortness of breath and chest pains after she left hospital - saying she was too tired to even get out of bed, the hearing was told. She passed out on August 29 while a community midwife was visiting the family at their home in Hanwell, west London. Her husband, Zaki Nour, told West London Coroners' Court how she was taken to Ealing Hospital where she told staff how tired she was and was advised by nurses to rest - moments before collapsing again. Maxine Nour, 24, from Hanwell, west London, gave birth in August 2011 but complained to her husband of shortness of breath and chest pains. She was taken to Ealing Hospital following a collapse . However, the DVT was not spotted and she was sent home following more tests, the inquest was told. Although she had been given an electrocardiagram (ECG) by paramedics, which showed tachycardia - an abnormally fast heartbeat which can be linked to a caesarean - before she was taken to the hospital, her doctor said she was never told about the condition. Dr Joanna Cook said she was not told about the results of the ECG carried out by the paramedics - which she admitted at the inquest were abnormal. She added if she had been told of the suggestion of tachycardia she would have asked for another ECG to be done at the hospital. She said: 'Mrs Nour spoke normally without shortness of breath. 'I didn't request an ECG because I didn't hear of any symptoms. Mrs Nour was found to have tachycardia - an abnormally fast heartbeat - by paramedics but a doctor at the hospital says she was not made aware of it . 'The observations (about the patient) were on a paper towel when I first assessed her as the notes hadn't been made up yet. The tachycardia was not on the paper towel.' But the tachycardia had no bearing on her death, according to experts. It was as Mrs Nour was leaving hospital that she collapsed for a second time. Mr Nour said: 'She was told to go to the desk to be discharged and she was walking really slowly there. 'She asked or a chair and she collapsed again and was taken back to the room, where she had some food and drink and rest and was sent home. 'Over the next few days, she was the same - really tired and had problems breathing.' He said his wife had told ambulance staff on an earlier occasion she was suffering chest pains. He said: 'She told the ambulance she always has chest pains.' A post-mortem examination showed the DVT had started in her pelvis and spread to her lungs in the space of around a week. She had not complained of pain in her legs prior to her death, which is a key symptom of DVT. Community midwife Grace Lee said she saw Mr Nour on the 21st and he did not express any concerns about his wife's health. She said she had no notes of her complaining about chest pain of shortness of breath. Paramedics called to the house on August 29th did not record any mention of chest pains or shortness of breath either - claiming Mrs Nour simply did not tell them. Expert witness, Mr Luca Fusi, said: 'Even if the massive embolism had been spotted on August 29th, it might not have helped Mrs Nour.' Coroner Lorna Tagliavini adjourned the inquest until Friday.

George Osborne today said he was ‘proud’ that the UK government is spending more on foreign aid. The Chancellor risked the wrath of Tory backbenchers who have called for cuts to international development by announcing an extra £800million for 2015-16. But to meet the coalition’s pledge to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on aid, money from the Home Office and Business will count towards the target. Aid: The coalition has committed to spending 0.7 per cent of national income on overseas aid, while cutting elsewhere . Proud: George Osborne defended the decision to increase foreign aid spending while cutting other Whitehall departments y up to 10 per cent . Right wingers on the Tory backbenchers have repeatedly called for an end to the protection given to overseas aid. Along with health and schools, it was one of the only areas of spending ring fenced by Mr Osborne in his search for an extra £11.5billion of cuts in 2015-16. In total the UK will spend £12.22billion in its Official Development Assistance commitment. It means it will spend 0.7 per cent of gross national income in 2015 on helping the poor overseas. It includes an extra £809million in the DFID budget. Around £100million in science research for helping poor countries from the Department for Business will also count towards the ODA target, along with £100million of Home Office funding for asylum cases. Spending: Only foreign aid, NHS and the spy agencies have seen increases in the departmental programme and administration budgets, with most departments suffering cuts of up to 10 per cent . Infrastructure: Billions of pounds in extra building projects have been directed towards transport, justice and business in an attempt to kickstart growth . Mr Osborne told MPs: ‘Fairness also means refusing to balance the budget on the backs of the world’s poorest. ‘I know not everyone believes we should fulfil our commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of our national income on development. ‘But I do – and I’m proud to support a Government that is the first in our history to meet our pledge and meet it not only this year, but next year and the year after. ‘Of course, overseas development is about more than just the DFID budget, and we comply with internationally policed rules. ‘But the DFID budget is the lion’s share, and it will be set at £11.1 billion in 2015-16. ‘Even in tough times, the decisions we make mean we keep to our commitments.’","Department for International Development given an extra £800million .

A school has been banned from a zoo for two years after a group of children decided to moon at monkeys. The 14 and 15-year-olds from Radclyffe School in Chadderton, Greater Manchester, were kicked out of Chester Zoo during a school trip. There were around 300 GCSE pupils from year 10, but as a result of the actions of nearly children, they all had to get on the buses and go home. The zoo said that 29 pupils were involved, but headmaster of the school Hardial Hayer disputed this saying that only 24 children took part.

'The spokesman added: 'We welcome schools to the zoo on the understanding that the students behave in such a way that does not cause problems for their fellow pupils, other visitors, the animals or staff. Fortunately incidents of this nature are extremely rare.' Mr Hayer insisted it was 24, rather than 29, students who were sent home early due to their behaviour. Reassurance: Radclyffe's headmaster Hardial Hayer said the school expects 'high standards standards of behaviour inside and outside school' as Chester Zoo imposes a ban on his pupils . He said: 'We had over 300 students at Chester Zoo as part of an experience day. It was 24 who didn’t meet our own high standards and that is why we brought them back.

An air force helicopter returning from a rescue mission in flood-ravaged northern India hit the side of a mountain and fell into a river today, killing eight people, officials said. Bad weather has hampered rescue efforts in Uttarakhand state, where more than 1,000 people are believed to have died and thousands of others remain stranded in remote areas from landslides and floods triggered by torrential monsoon rains. Other air force helicopters were unable to take off due to poor visibility, Group Capt Sandeep Mehta said.

A man cries in pain as he is carried away by soldiers from an army helicopter during a rescue operation at Joshimath in the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand . The air force has ordered an inquiry into the crash in the temple town of Kedarnath, said Indian Air Force spokesman Priya Joshi. Five crew members and three civilians were on board the helicopter, she said. Joshi said 45 aircraft were involved in rescue and relief operations in Uttarakhand. Air force chief NAK Browne assured flood survivors yesterday that the air force would rescue everyone stranded in Uttarakhand, but bad weather and poor visibility has led to the frequent suspension of evacuation flights. Authorities also prepared today to cremate the bodies of hundreds of people who perished in the floods. Truckloads of wooden logs were loaded onto air force transport planes and flown to Kedarnath to be used in a mass funeral and cremation for the flood victims.

Troops are also trying to rescue about 5,000 people who remain stranded in Badrinath town eight days after the torrential rains began. Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde said the death toll in the Uttarakhand floods would exceed 1,000. So far the army has rescued about 90,000 people from hundreds of villages and small towns hit by the floods. Entire towns were flattened by landslides that were followed by floods. Roads were washed away and telecommunication links snapped, cutting off many parts of the state. In the town of Gauchar, which is the centre of rescue and relief operations, authorities made arrangements to send about a dozen Hindu priests to Kedarnath.

At least 600 bodies were found buried in silt in and around the Kedarnath temple, one of Hinduism's most revered pilgrim sites. Health experts say there are dangers of disease outbreaks unless the bodies are cremated. Medical teams are taking DNA samples and photographs of the unidentified bodies before they are cremated. The federal health ministry said it has sent more than 1 million chlorine tablets to purify drinking water supplies in Uttarakhand. The ministry has also sent several teams of doctors to help flood survivors. Every summer, hundreds of thousands of devout Hindus make a pilgrimage known as the Char Dham Yatra to four temple towns in Uttarakhand. The pilgrims usually return before monsoon rains begin in July. But this year they were caught by unprecedented heavy rains and flash floods.","Bad weather has hampered rescue efforts in Uttarakhand state .

Ever bumped into a friend when you're not looking your best or when you're just not in the mood for a chat? Well there is now an app to help you avoid these awkward social situations. The Hell is for Other People app uses location-based social networking site Foursquare to track any friends who have checked into locations nearby. These locations are then plotted on an 'avoidance map' and users can make sure they keep their distance. Scroll down for video . The Hell Is Other People app pinpoints the latest 20 venues that a user's friends have visited on Foursquare, pictured here in orange. The map also produces green 'safe' areas where a user can be alone . Branded an 'experiment in anti-social media', the app calculates how far away a user must be to avoid their friends. Orange . points on the map indicate the 20 most recent places that friends have . visited and the time of their Foursquare 'check-in'. Green areas . denote 'optimally distanced safe zones' around the user's local . neighbourhood to avoid any unwanted encounters. Ironically, . perhaps, for people seeking to avoid any social interaction, users of . the app must be a member of Foursquare social network. The name of the app is taken from a line in Jean-Paul Sartre's 'No Exit' and was created by Scott Garner, a student at New York University's Interactive Telecommunications Programme. Garner says that his app is: 'partially a satire, partially a commentary on my disdain for ""social media"" and partially an exploration of my own difficulties with social anxiety.' In a promotional video that shows Garner navigate New York with his app and explain his hatred of social media, he says: 'I had to sign up for a social media site and talk to people to get them to be my friends on that site so I could avoid them'. New York University Student Scott Garner (pictured) named the app after a line from Jean-Paul Sartre's 'No Exit' and describes it as a commentary on his disdain for social media . The concept has managed to achieve the exact opposite of social network Foursquare's mission, which is to connect people so they can meet friends, find and recommend places to hang out. However, the antisocial app does rely on a user's friends using Foursquare to check-in to venues, so there is still a chance that a user could meet friends who are flying under the radar. It is questionable as to whether the solitary user achieves social isolation as they continually have to check on their friends' locations to ensure that their 'safe zone' is up to date. Garner is considering adding more data from social media sites in the distant future, such as Twitter's geo-tagged tweets and Facebook's check-ins. This would enable users to have more secure safe zones and avoid unwanted meetings, according to The Huffington Post.","App uses location-based social networking site Foursquare to track friends .

"By . Jill Reilly . PUBLISHED: . 07:21 EST, 25 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:55 EST, 25 June 2013 . Google is not obliged to delete personal information from its search results, an adviser to the European court of justice has decided. In a defeat for the so-called 'right to be forgotten' privacy principle under debate in Europe, an  adviser to the highest European Union court backed the internet search giant's position that it cannot erase legal content from the internet even if it is harmful to an individual. But he rejected the view of many U.S. internet firms that they are not bound by EU privacy law. Ruling: The European Court of Justice has said that Google and other search engines are not responsible when personal information appears on web pages they index . 'Requesting search engine service providers to suppress legitimate and legal information that has entered the public domain would entail an interference with the freedom of expression,' the Luxembourg-based court said in a statement setting out Advocate General Niilo Jaaskinen's opinion. While internet-based firms operating in the European Union must adhere to national data protection laws, that did not oblige them to remove personal content produced by third parties, the statement said. 'Search engine service providers are not responsible, on the basis of the (EU's) Data Protection Directive, for personal data appearing on web pages they process.' Lawyers agree that Google's search algorithms, which hunt and list weblinks based on how relevant they may be, would not be in a position to 'know' whether data was personal or not. 'A search engine is just a tool,' said Eduardo Ustaran, a London-based lawyer from Field Fisher Waterhouse. 'The nature of that information is irrelevant. It is just ones and zeros.' A final judgment on the case is expected before the end of the year. Judges in the European Court of Justice are not bound by an advocate general's opinion, but follow such recommendations in the majority of cases. Backed: An adviser to the highest European Union court backed the internet search giant's position that it cannot erase legal content from the internet even if it is harmful to an individual . The case stems from a complaint by a Spanish man that a public notice announcing that his home was up for auction after being repossessed infringed his privacy and should be deleted from Google's search results. His case is one of 180 similar examples in Spain in which people have sought to have content deleted from Google searches. The other cases are on hold pending the EU court's decision. The original auction announcement was from a Spanish newspaper, which said it was under a legal obligation to publish the notice. Google welcomed the advocate general's opinion, saying it supported the company's view that deleting such content amounted to censorship. 'This is a good opinion for free expression,' said Bill Echikson, Google's head of free expression in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, in an emailed statement. But Internet companies may be disappointed at the opinion that they should follow EU privacy law even if the data is handled outside the European Union. Many internet firms maintain that handling data outside the 27-member bloc means they are not subject to EU privacy law. The advocate general said that even the presence of an advertisings business, which is fundamental to the model of companies such as Google and which targets people in Spain, means they must follow EU law. If that view is upheld by the ECJ, it could put search firms under more pressure to protect the data of privacy-hungry Europeans. The European Union is finalising a major overhaul of its 20-year-old data protection law that would make internet companies follow EU rules if their services target European consumers. The overhaul is part of a push for increased data privacy in Europe, which has gained urgency after revelation of a large-scale U.S. Internet spying programme targeted at foreigners. Google also faces fines in both Spain and France if it does not change its privacy policy, which allows it to collect and combine personal data across its services such as email and Youtube. Privacy watchdogs in several other countries are also assessing Google's services under their national rules. The EU overhaul is also intended to give citizens 'a right to be forgotten' even though it is not yet clear in what circumstances that right could be invoked. The advocate general said such a right does not exist in current legislation.","Defeat for the so-called 'right to be forgotten' privacy principle .

"By . Ruth Lythe . PUBLISHED: . 20:00 EST, 25 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:00 EST, 25 June 2013 . Nothing had prepared Vicky Anning for the heart-breaking task of telling her two-year-old daughter Jenna that Daddy had died. At the age of 39, Ben, who had been fighting cancer for 12 months, passed away in 2006. As Ms Anning mourned, and prepared for life raising Jenna alone, she barely had time to think about money. Safety net: Vicky Anning with Jenna, eight, said her finances would have been desperate after husband Ben (right) died if she had not had state support. The Widowed Parent's Allowance will be cut from 2016 . However, even though she continued to work as a writer and editor, the loss of the salary her husband brought in as a charity director began to bite. Things would have been desperate had it not been for a little-known payment from the Government called Widowed Parent’s Allowance. The £2,000 one-off lump sum and the £89 a week she gets has allowed her to keep on top of bills and take time off when Jenna, now eight, needed it most. It’s been a godsend. But from 2016, these vital payments are to be slashed for families who lose a parent after this date. They’ll get a bigger lump sum of £5,000. But the regular payments will be stopped after a year. It’s a move which could force people to return to work or push them into debt just as their family is getting back on its feet. Ms Anning, from Cambridge, says: ‘The allowance had been an absolute lifeline for me. It does not replace Ben’s income, but it has meant I could afford the mortgage, allowing us to avoid having to move home. ‘Even though Jenna was a baby when she lost her father, she is still going through different stages of grief as she grows up and sometimes gets upset when she remembers she doesn’t have a dad. Ms Anning, at their home in Cambridge, said the payments were a 'lifeline' for her family . ‘The extra support means I’m more likely to be around when she needs me. For a family in our position, not to have that security would be an enormous loss.’ Widowed Parent’s Allowance is to be cut back as part of changes to the pension system. Currently, widows and widowers with children can claim up to £108.30 a week. What each family gets depends on the deceased person’s National Insurance record. On top of this they get a one-off tax-free lump sum of £2,000, called a Bereavement Payment. The weekly payouts, which are taxable, continue until the youngest child finishes full-time education at either 16 or 19. But from 2016 the Government wants to limit payments to £400 a month for 12 months only and is finalising its plans. Those already claiming will not be affected. The tax-free lump-sum will rise to £5,000. But the average family, which receives £107 a week now, will lose £764 over a year in regular payments. Those with younger children will be deprived of tens of thousands over the course of their education. Ministers claim the Government needs to reform the allowance because single parents can become dependent on it and have their prospects of finding a job hindered. They also say some parents could be put off marrying again because it would mean they would no longer qualify for the allowance. Ben died aged 39 in 2006 after a 12 month battle with cancer . The Childhood Bereavement Network charity estimates 94 per cent of widowed working parents will be worse off under the new system. The changes will affect only those who start to claim the benefit from 2016. The 43,500 families already in receipt of the allowance are unaffected by the reforms. Working parents with young children will be hardest hit. Under the old system they would have been eligible to claim the allowance for up to 19 years, but under the new plan they would get cash for just 12 months. And unlike unemployed parents they will not be able to top up their income with other benefits. Analysis by the Department for Work and . Pensions (DWP) shows a family with a working parent who claimed Widowed . Parent’s Allowance for 11 years would be £5,100 a year worse off a year . under the new system. An unemployed parent would be £4,100 poorer. Because of the higher one-off payment both working and unemployed single parents would be better off in the first year after the death of a partner with the new system. But in the second year (when payments will cease under the changes), an unemployed single parent would lose £2,400 and a working parent £3,800. A further study by the DWP reveals that in 2016 the Government expects to pay £550 million a year to bereaved couples and families. However, because of the changes, payouts would drop to £490 million three years later. Analysis shows family's like Ms Anning's, where one parent dies, will be up to £5,100 a year worse off under the new system being introduced from 2016 . All parents who are entitled to Child Benefit and who have lost a husband, wife or civil partner can receive Widowed Parent’s Allowance. It stops only when a parent remarries or if they stop receiving Child Benefit. In other changes, Ministers are proposing that childless adults under the age of 45 who lose their husband wife or civil partner will be entitled to payments of £150 a month for a year. They will also be able to receive a one-off lump sum of £2,500. Currently only those aged over 45 and below state pension age can receive this money, known as Bereavement Allowance. Di Stubbs, spokesman for the Childhood Bereavement Network, says: ‘Young children who have suffered the devastating loss of their mum or dad are the wrong target for Government cuts. ‘These families are not benefits scroungers. The majority of the surviving parents work and have paid into the system for many years before losing their partners. ‘Often children will only start to be affected by a death two or even three years after the event. At that point, the living parent needs to be emotionally available so they can help their child when they most need it, and not working three jobs or long hours.’ A spokesman for Department of Work and Pensions says: ‘Bereavement benefits are an important part of welfare protection, providing support for families through the very difficult times of life. ‘But the current system is overly complex and out-dated.’","The Widowed Parent's Allowance will be cut from 2016 under new plans .

Russian media tycoon Alexander Lebedev, whose prosecution was signed off by a former classmate of President Vladimir Putin . The controversial criminal prosecution of newspaper owner Alexander Lebedev was started by a former university classmate of Vladimir Putin, it was claimed at the newspaper owner's trial. A document in the case file records shows that the probe was demanded by Alexander Bastrykin, chairman of the powerful Investigative Committee, known as the Russian FBI, said a Lebedev lawyer. The media magnate is accused of the draconian offence of hooliganism motivated by 'political hatred' in lashing out at property mogul Sergei Polonsky during a heated TV debate. The revelation comes as a lawyer for Polonsky predicted to a Russian journalist that Lebedev will be jailed next week for three years. The maximum penalty is five years. The court file refers to 'an order' from Bastrykin 'to investigate the circumstances of Polonsky being beaten' during the television show. In a demand relayed via a subordinate, his order was to  'establish objectively all the circumstances of the incident' and 'submit a draft decision to start criminal proceedings under article 213 of the Criminal Code'. A day later Polonsky signed an application to start criminal proceedings in the case. Lebedev's lawyer Genri Reznik expressed concern in court that Bastrykin had ordered the supposedly objective probe at the same time as calling for the start of criminal proceedings under the draconian power. The same criminal charge was used last year to jail two singers from punk group Pussy Riot after a protest against Vladimir Putin in a Moscow cathedral. Bastrykin is Russia's top law enforcement chief and studied at Leningrad State University in the same class as Putin. Judge Andrey Bakhvalov announced today that he will personally interrogate the tycoon in a court session on Thursday after which closing arguments from prosecutors and defence lawyers are expected. A verdict is then expected by Wednesday next week, according to court sources. Old school ties: Mr Putin, left, studied at Leningrad State University in the same class as Alexander Bastrykin, right, who is head of the Russian Investigative Committee, that country's equivalent to the FBI . Lebedev, 53, owns investigative newspaper Novaya Gazeta in Russia and his family controls the London Evening Standard and The Independent titles. His legal team have denied the 'punches' even made contact with Polonsky and insist there was no political malice. The Kremlin has denied that Putin interferes with the independence of the judiciary despite claims this prosecution is politically motivated by Lebedev's ownership of Novaya Gazeta. Polonsky has been absent from a trial which has been dubbed 'farcical' after it was claimed by his legal team that he is in Cambodia on bail and cannot leave the country. However, images of him surfaced in Tel Aviv and one lawyer has admitted she is seeking asylum for him in Israel. Prosecution witnesses included people who watched the show on TV. One was recruited randomly when she stepped off a bus in central Moscow. Lebedev has said he is 'steeling' himself for jail despite insisting he is not guilty of the hooliganism charge. Farcical: Polonsky has been absent from the trial after his legal team claimed he's in on bail Cambodia and can't leave the country. However this picture surfaced last week purportedly showing him in Israel . Polonsky lawyer Alexander Dobrovinsky said Lebedev was likely to be jailed for three years, according to a Novaya Gazeta report. The paper has questioned whether the verdict is already set before the trial is over. Analysts say the case raises issues of press freedom amid claims the state is using draconian powers to gag a newspaper proprietor. 'I don't want to criticise our legal system, I am satisfied with the way it treats me,' said Lebedev recently. 'I am not exactly enjoying this but it is all new experience for me. Remember that the judge is the part of the system, and won't go against it. 'Don't say Kremlin is after me, it is all about the machinery. Once they started the engine and began all this against me, they must go on, it is just a big and heavy machine.'","Investigative Committee head Alexander Bastrykin studied with the Russian leader at Leningrad State University .

Carl Mills, who is accused of killing three generations of the same family after setting fire to their home, pictured arriving at Newport Crown Court . A jealous boyfriend killed his own baby daughter, her mother and grandmother after torching their home on the day the child was released from hospital, a murder trial has heard today. Carl Mills, 29, is accused of killing three generations of the same family after setting their home ablaze. Kayleigh Buckley, 17, six-month-old daughter Kimberley and grandmother Kim, 46, were all trapped in their home when it was engulfed in flames. Newport Crown Court heard how Mills started the fire after he became convinced Kayleigh had another man in her bedroom. But the only people inside were the family - who were celebrating Kimberley’s homecoming after being born prematurely at just 1lb 9ozs in hospital. Neighbours saw Kayleigh banging on the windows and screaming for help but they were unable to save her. Prosecutor Greg Bull said: 'The three victims didn’t have a chance.' He said they were unable to get down the stairs because of where the fire was set. He said: 'Within minutes it became impossible to save the people inside. Neighbours did all the right things but they were confronted with a scene which can only be described as heartbreaking. 'Kayleigh was in the window of a smoke-filled room crying for help for her and her baby. 'People were calling out “Jump” but she wouldn’t leave her baby. Neighbours could hear her saying she was on fire. 'Then within a few minutes there was silence. All of the victims died in the fire.' The court heard Mills (left) started the fire after he became convinced Kayleigh (right) had another man in her bedroom . The court heard the only people in the house were grandmother Kim (left, with granddaughter Kimberley), Kayleigh and the six-month-old baby, who had just returned from hospital after being born prematurely . The court heard how Kayleigh met Mills when she was 15 on the internet - he was living in Manchester and travelled to her home in Cwmbran, South Wales. Mr Bull said: 'He deliberately set out to groom her sexually. Their relationship developed into a sexual one. He seemed to exercise a magnetic control over Kayleigh. 'Mills became obsessively jealous of Kayleigh. He became obsessed she was involved with other boys.' The court heard Kayleigh became pregnant with twins born in March of last year. Prosecutor Greg Bull said Mills became 'obsessively jealous of Kayleigh' after they met on the internet . One twin, Angel, died at just two days after being born weighing 15 oz but doctors were able to save Kimberley who weighed 1lb 9oz. The baby was named after her gran who gave up her job as an Avon lady to help raise her. Mr Bull said: 'Kayleigh started acting as a mother and that was one of the factors which caused this violent crime. 'Mills didn’t want Kayleigh to spend more time with the baby. He wanted Kayleigh to be with him and him alone. He become convinced she was having an affair with another man.' 'Kayleigh was in the window of a smoke-filled room crying for help for her and her baby. People were calling out “Jump” but she wouldn’t leave her baby' - Prosecutor Greg Bull . Mills was not invited to the homecoming of baby Kim when she was allowed out of the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport. The court heard he had been threatening and controlling for months - and had been banned from the family home. But Mills wouldn’t leave Kayleigh alone and was sleeping in a tent in front of the family home. The family home was decorated with balloons and banners for Kimberley - but the court heard Mills allegedly flew into a rage. The court heard texts were sent by Mills to Kayleigh on the night before she died. One said 'I’ll burn your house down', while another read 'I hope you f****** get burnt'. Another text read 'You lot made a mistake, a very bad mistake,' while a further text said 'Sleep with one eye open you dirty s***'. The court heard Mills started the fire in the porchway of the three-bed house . His fingerprints were found on a welcome home banner which he had ripped down on the night of the fire in September last year. The court heard how he also sent a string of messages taunting Kayleigh about the balloons outside the house - which the prosecution claim places him at the scene. In the messages he threatens Kayleigh who he believes has another man in the house, saying he will cut off electricity to the house, then set fire to it, the court heard. He also explains how he wants to blow up the oxygen cylinders there to help little Kimberly with her lung problems. The court heard how Kayleigh's mother Kim (pictured) did not like Mills but made efforts to include him in the family . Mr Bull told how Mills started the fire in the porchway of the three-bed house - and the fire quickly spread. He said: 'The fire extended rapidly and the stairs were soon breached and the door gave way. It created a fireball into the roof which burned down into the bedroom. 'The house was well ablaze. The fire service tried to enter but it was too ferocious. As this mayhem was developing, along came Mills. 'Neighbours were shocked by how calm he appeared to be. He showed no emotion and did not attempt to rescue his daughter or the woman he claimed to love. 'It was the actions of a cold-hearted killer who knew exactly what he was doing. He had carried out the threat he had made hours earlier.' Mills, of no fixed abode, denies three charges of murder. The court heard how Kayleigh’s mother Kimberley did not like Mills but made efforts to include him in the family. Mr Bull said: 'Kim was frightened of Mills who she thought was unpredictable and threatening. 'He had violent mood swings and often threatened to do harm to them. Kim tried to involve Mills but he became more controlling of Kayleigh. His behaviour was abusive and irrational.' The court heard how two weeks before the murders, Mills had 'trashed' the family home while baby Kimberley was still in hospital. He was reported to police for criminal damage while the family were out of their home in Cwmbran. The court heard grandmother Kim was given guardianship rights over the baby and Mills was not allowed to see her unsupervised. Mr Bull said: 'Mills would not have access on his own to the baby and this caused hatred and resentment to Kim and Kayleigh. 'There were threats to both of them by setting their house on fire. Mills told Kim in a text message that he was going to burn her from the earth.' Mr Bull said the threats reached a peak on the night baby Kimberley was due home. The jury was told that Mills wouldn't leave Kayleigh (pictured) alone and was sleeping in a tent in front of the family home . Mr Bull said: 'It was meant to be a day of great joy and celebration.' But the court heard it became one of tragedy after Mills repeatedly accused Kayleigh of having another man in the house. He said: 'For a considerable period of hours the text messages show Mills getting more and more frustrated by Kayleigh. He was obsessive and jealous, assuming she was sleeping with someone else.' The court heard he repeatedly texted 'Bring him out' before the arson attack at around 3.30am - just six hours after his baby arrived home. The trial continues.

Aston Martin celebrated its 100th anniversary by unveiling a concept car inspired by the firm's famous Le Mans victory. The CC100 Speedster Concept Car has been designed by Aston Martin to give 'glimpses of potential future design direction'. But its main inspiration is from the iconic DBR1 racer which Carroll Shelby and Roy Salvadori drove to victory at the 1959 Le Mans. One-of-a-kind: The Aston Martin CC100 Speedster Concept was unveiled today to celebrate 100 years of the company . Front view: The concept car was inspired by the firm's famous car used at the Le Mans victory in 1959, which Carrol Shelby and Roy Salvadori drove . The CC100 concept car made its global debut today, completing a lap of the famous Nordschleife at Germany's 24 Hours of Nurburgring race. Aston Martin has fitted the CC100 with a 6-litre V12 engine - giving the roofless motor a 0-62mph time of four seconds and a top speed of 180mph. It is understood the one-off rocket, which will be shown around the world as part of Aston Martin's 100th birthday celebrations, has been sold to a wealthy client for around £500,000. Dr Ulrich Bez, boss of Aston Martin, drove the CC100 at the Nurburgring. He was joined by British racing legend Sir Stirling Moss, who was behind the wheel of the original DBR1 when it won the 1,000km race at The 'Ring in 1959. Concept car: The CC100 completed a lap of the famous Nordschleife at Germany's 24 Hours of Nurburgring race .

Sleek: The car, which was designed as part of the 100th anniversary celebrations, has been sold for £500,000 to a wealthy client . Dr Bez said: 'CC100 is the epitome of everything that is great about Aston Martin. 'It represents our fantastic sporting heritage, our exceptional design capability, our superb engineering know-how and, above all, our adventurous spirit. 'I have nicknamed it 'DBR100' because of its affinity to the great 1959 race-winning cars and, of course, our 100-year anniversary in 2013.

Martin - the thing that differentiates us from all the other car makers . out there - is as powerful as ever and I very much hope that everyone . who catches a glimpse of it at the Nurburgring today enjoys seeing it.' The original DBR1 is now regarded as one of the most valuable cars in the world with Ascot dealer Talacrest advertising it for £20 million last year. At the time, Talacrest boss John Collins called the DBR1 'the holy grail of motoring', and 'the most recognisable and valuable Aston Martin in history'. Classic: Carroll Shelby and Roy Salvadori drove the 1959 Le Mans DBR1 racer to victory . Iconic: The iconic design has become a symbol of Aston Martin, which is why it has been recreated in the anniversary car . The CC100 concept was designed and built in less than six months at Aston Martin's global headquarters in Gaydon, Warwickshire. Measuring . almost four and a half metres nose to tail, and more than two metres . wide, the Speedster is made from lightweight carbon fibre. Miles Nurnberger, chief exterior designer, said: 'The brief was very simple, yet enormously testing: create something that reflects the 100 years of Aston Martin heritage and signals the future of the brand.

Smooth lines: The 1959 Aston martin DB4 is one of the most iconic designs the company has produced, with its sleek lines and comfortable interior . 'The idea of an iconic speedster concept that nods to the Le Mans - and Nurburgring - winning cars of 1959 soon came, and we have had complete freedom to shape this car.' Marek Reichman, design director, added: 'I'm extremely proud of the entire team at Gaydon for creating this remarkable sports car concept in such a short time.

The sun may be only just peeking through, but it’s enough for British supercar maker Aston Martin to launch its blistering new £200,000 flagship soft-top. Perfectly styled for James Bond to cruise in with the top-down, the car firm describes it as ‘ultimate convertible super GT’ and the first with an all lightweight but super-strong carbon-fibre body. Aston Martin, which is this year celebrating its 100th anniversary, said the new Vanquish Volante is a ‘no compromise’ car. Scroll down for video .

Its performance is identical to the Vanquish coupe sprinting from rest to 60mph in just 4.1 seconds and a top speed of 183mph.The order book opened today with first deliveries expected in the autumn. Aston Martin says the body structure is the most rigid Volante it has ever built and means ‘uncorrupted ride comfort’ and precise handling.

When detectives investigate hit-and-run incidents, it often involves illegal drivers in high-powered cars. But after a 77-year-old woman was sent flying into the air during a horrific hit- and-run in Norfolk, police are searching for a slightly more sedate form of vehicle - a mobility scooter. Great-grandmother Pauline Potter was left with a broken foot after she was hit outside a garden . centre in Norwich following a shopping trip with her daughter. Collision: Detectives are hunting for a mobility scooter rider after 77-year-old Pauline Potter was sent flying into the air following an horrific hit-and-run outside a garden centre. She is pictured with her furious daughter Denise Maskell . Injured: The great-grandmother was left with a broken foot after she was hit outside a garden centre by a mobility scooter. This is a file picture . Denise Maskell said her ailing mother, who walks with a stick, has not been able to walk properly or sleep since the incident. Mother-of-three Ms Maskell said: 'It's disgusting that she's having to go through this. 'She has a lot of health problems and just didn't need this.' The . crash happened at about 3pm on Saturday. The duo were returning to . their car after Ms Maskell had taken her mother to buy some plants at . Mousehold Garden Centre. 'We'd had a nice day out. We'd put her plants down ready to open the car door and I heard her . scream out and as I turned round this mobility scooter had ploughed into . her,' said Ms Maskell. 'She went right over the top of it.' She immediately tried to pick her mother up from the floor to avoid her being struck by passing cars. Ms Maskell was even helped by four Good Samaritans who went to her aid. 'Mum just couldn't stand up,' she said. 'Four people came to help me get her up and I wanted to thank them, they were brilliant.' Ms Maskell took her distraught mother home. Accidents involving mobility scooters are not as rare as some might think. Following an increase in accidents in Norfolk, its police force launched a Safe Scoot campaign, which was also rolled out nationwide. There are about 330,000 people in the UK who use mobility scooters, with models capable of speeds from 4mph to 8mph. Some of them are difficult to manoeuvre and have led to accidents. The course teaches basic manoeuvres such as starting off, reversing, negotiating shopping aisles. But . she was unable to walk and they called an ambulance which took Mrs . Potter to the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital for an X-ray, which showed . she had broken a foot. Her foot had to be put in a temporary plaster but she has now been given a boot to wear to try and help it heal. Ms Maskell said her mother has been in agony and can hardly get up off the sofa or sleep. 'I'm very upset that the person responsible failed to stop. 'I think it's disgusting,' said Ms Maskell. 'It was a big scooter. 'He or she knew they hit my mother and they just carried on going and that's what makes me really angry. 'They were coming up behind us and so saw my mother had a stick. 'They just came from nowhere and my poor mum flew up in the air.' Ms Maskell urged anyone with information about the incident to contact police, who have launched an investigation.","Great-grandmother Pauline Potter flung into the air outside a garden .

Soaring petrol prices, motoring taxes and a ‘plague’ of year-round potholes mean Britain’s ‘battle-scarred’  drivers are at their most miserable for 25 years – many of them women, a new RAC report reveals today. A boom in aggressive driving and bad manners, widespread mobile-phone abuse – not forgetting speed cameras which didn’t exist in the ‘golden age’ of 1989 when even mobiles were in their infancy and weighed a ton - has left  motorists fuming – though more reliant than ever on their wheels. Price: The report charts the rise in fuel prices over 25 years. Costs have soared by 264 per cent . Reliant: Nine out of ten drivers say they are more reliant on their cars now than they were 25 years ago . Significantly, a much greater number of . drivers – 16.7 million in total - are now women as the proportion of . female licence-holders has swelled over the two and a half decades from . 40 per cent  to nearly half (46 per cent). But so bad is motorists’ morale over rising costs that a third (31 per cent) say they would even accept Government plans for controversial road tolls if road tax and fuel duty were both cut in return – though this is down on nearly four out of ten (38 per cent) last year. Some 42 per cent disagree with tolls and 27 per cent undecided (compared to 43 per cent who disagreed last year with 19 per cent undecided). The snap-shot of attitudes – and how they compare with a quarter of a century ago – is revealed in the 25th RAC Report on Motoring for 2012. Some 61 per cent of drivers cited rising costs as their biggest gripe over quarter of a century: ‘The biggest perceived change in the last 25 years is the increased cost of motoring ’. But nine out of ten drivers (89 per cent) admit to being more reliant on their cars than 25 years ago with almost as many (78 per cent) saying they’d find it difficult to have a ‘car-free’ lifestyle. Just 17 per cent of drivers think motoring taxes ‘fair’, it notes: ’Nearly half of motorists (49 per cent) are unhappy with the balance and there is significant support for shifting the weighting from fuel duty and vehicle excise duty towards paying to drive on motorways an in city centres.’ ‘Almost a third of drivers (31 per cent) would support the introduction of more toll roads in return for a reduction in current motoring taxes., though this percentage has dropped from 38 per cent last year.’' Some 29per cent were prepared to pay tolls for motorway driving, while 33 per cent backed city-centre congestion charges as long as the cost of fuel and car tax was ‘significantly’ reduced. Angry: A combination of greater expense and poor driving etiquette is what frustrates drivers most . Back in 1989 – when Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister, US President Ronald Reagan left the White House in January,  and the fall of the Berlin Wall in November marked the end of the Cold War,  unleaded petrol was around a third of the price today at  38.5p a litre ( £1.75 a gallon) compared to 134.2p a litre  (£6.10 per gallon) today. Diesel has also soared nearly three-fold from 36.1p a litre (£1.64 a gallon) to 138.9p a litre (£6.31 a gallon). Fuel duty has also increased from 17.7p a litre for petrol and 17.3p a litre for  diesel to a standard rate of 57.95p a litre. And that’s before the VAT tax is added at 15 per cent in 1989 but 20 per cent today. There were 10 million fewer cars on the road (24.2 million compared to 34.5 million today). Top five sellers in 1989 were the Ford Escort, Ford Sierra, Ford Fiesta,  Vauxhall Cavalier and Vauxhall Astra.  The top five sellers the year-to the end of May 2013 are the Ford Fiesta, Ford Focus,  Vauxhall Corsa, Vauxhall Astra and the Volkswagen Golf. There were seven million fewer drivers. But much of the increase since then  is down to women. Of the 27.8million drivers on the road in 1989,  11.1 million (40 per cent) were women, the remaining 16.7million (60 per cent) were men. Today, of the  35.2million drivers, 16.3million (46.3 per cent) are women,  compared to 18.9million (53.7 per cent) who are men. And it would be around three years before the first speed cameras arrived. The RAC report notes: ’One of the biggest changes to motoring in the past quarter of a century has been the huge increase in fuel prices – a whopping increase of  264 per cent in just two and a half decades.’ And on tax it adds: ’Today the total cost of fuel duty has  soared by over 240 per cent.’ In 1989 Vehicle excise duty on a family car was £100. Today under the ‘polluter pays’ policy  it’s on a sliding scale based on C02 emissions from zero tax for ultra clean cars up to more than £1,000 for  gas-guzzlers, with mid-range cars facing around £475 a year. On lack of  courtesy,  two thirds (65 per cent) of drivers think road rage has got worse with almost as many (62 per cent) bemoaning a growing lake of courtesy, with more than a quarter (28 per cent) saying driving is ‘more aggressive’ than 25 years ago. More than 1 in 5 (22 per cent are frustrated by growing jams and congestion on motorways and in towns and cities with almost as many (20 per cent) saying it’s harder to find a parking spot. And three quarters (76 per cent) point to illegal hand-held mobile phone by other drivers  use  as a growing source of stress. Unhappy: Road rage has increased in the past 25 years . The report notes: ‘Those who were driving  in 1989 look back on this as a golden age of motoring and feel that driving in Britain in 2013 is less enjoyable. ‘Currently the harsh reality for  many motorists is one where journeys to work or just to the shops are fraught with traffic jams, road works, potholes and fuel prices over £1.39 a litre.’ RAC technical director David Bizley said Britain's motorists and roads have been left ‘battle-scarred’ bearing an unfair burden: ‘The report suggests that motorists would prefer to see a higher share of motoring taxation levied on those things over which they have greater control - such as whether or not they choose to drive into city centres or use a particular motorway.’ The cost of driving was the biggest concern for 49per cent of motorists, with 41per cent saying maintenance of local roads and motorways is their top spending priority. Some 84per cent of the 1,542 drivers polled believed their local roads were deteriorating. On the positive side today’s cars are safer, less-polluting, and far more fuel efficient than 25 years ago. This is the 25th published RAC Report on Motoring. The first was published in 1989, using data collated at the end of 1988 and early 1989. RAC is calling it the ‘Silver Anniversary’ edition.","Britain's drivers say aggressive driving, bad manners and mobile phone use makes road experience worse .

Drinking excessive amounts of cola can cause people to faint or suffer an irregular heartbeat, reveals new research. Researchers found downing large amounts of cola drinks can cause unusual fainting and symptoms of irregular heartbeat, also known as arrhythmia, as well as causing people to pile on the pounds. A case study was presented at the EHRA Europace 2013 meeting in Athens. Drinking large amounts of cola can lead to unusual symptoms such as fainting, irregular heartbeat and weight gain . Professor Andreas Goette, the EHRA Scientific Programme Committee chairperson, said: 'The study underlines the importance of clinicians taking detailed medical histories for patients with unexplained arrhythmias and including questions about their dietary intakes.' In the abstract Doctor Naima Zarqane and Professor Nadir Saoudi, from the Princess Grace Hospital Centre in Monaco reported how excessive consumption of cola drinks can result in marked potassium loss and potentially life threatening arrhythmias. They described the case of a 31-year-old woman admitted to hospital for traumatic syncope, or fainting. Once other problems had been excluded - including a family history of sudden death - tests revealed the patient had blood potassium levels of 2.4 mmol/L, and a QTc - the QT interval on the ECG corrected for heart rate - of 610 ms. Normal blood potassium levels range between 3.5 to 5.1 mmol/L; while the normal QTc for women is less than or equal to 450 ms. Professor Nadir Saoudi, from the Princess Grace Hospital Centre in Monaco reported how excessive consumption of cola drinks can result potentially life threatening arrhythmias . When they took a medical history the clinicians discovered that since the age of 15 years the patient had exclusively replaced water with cola drinks. When cola consumption ceased on medical advice, the patient’s potassium level returned to 4.1 mmol/L at one week, and 4.2 mmol/L at one month, and her QTc duration returned to 430 ms at one week. A search revealed six other case studies where excessive cola consumption could be related to adverse medical conditions including rhabdomyolysis - damaged skeletal muscle tissue, arrhythmias, and even one death related to Torsades de pointes - a form of ventricular tachycardia that can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation. There are two potential explanations for the connection between cola consumption and low blood potassium level, according to the researchers. Through osmotic principles the high fructose corn syrup content of cola is likely to prevent water from being absorbed by the gut and lead to people suffering from diarrhoea that is associated with heavy fluid losses that ‘flush’ potassium out of the body. And caffeine in the cola is also likely to have an effect on the kidneys where it reduces the amount of potassium that is reabsorbed. Caffeine in cola is likely to have a negative effect on the kidneys as it reduces the amount of potassium that is absorbed . In the heart reduced extracellular potassium can inhibit the potassium current in ion channels and delay ventricular repolarisation that may in turn promote arrhythmias. Doctor Zarqane said: 'One of the take home messages is that cardiologists need to be aware of the connection between cola consumption and potassium loss and should ask patients found to have QT prolongation about beverage habits.' Prof Saoudi saidd: “It’s also important that the people are made aware of the potential health dangers of excessive consumption of sugary drinks. 'There are important political messages for governments to ensure that bottled water is cheaper than sugary drinks, which is not always the case.' He said a further study would be helpful to explore whether there are differences in blood levels of potassium between people who had high cola intakes, and people who did not consume the drink. And excessive drinking of cola and other sugary beverages is likely to have additional adverse cardiovascular effects. Prof Saoudi added: 'Due to the high calorie intake it’s likely to result in weight gain which increases the risk of developing metabolic syndrome.'","Downing large amounts of cola drinks may cause unusual symptoms .

A rugby-loving teenager, who came within just one centimetre of being paralysed, has amazed doctors by returning to the pitch less than a year after breaking her back. Megan Mallinson, 14, slipped and fell down the stairs at her home in Leeds, Yorkshire, in August last year and for months required round-the-clock care. She had been playing on her mobile phone at the time when she accidentally missed a step. Earlier this month a study found that . mobile phone-related injuries had doubled in just five years and that . the number was set to double again by 2015. Megan Mallinson, 14, slipped and fell down the stairs at her home in Leeds last August. She broke her back in two places and also broke her foot. Doctors feared she could be paralysed . Megan was required to wear a spinal . brace for almost three months to re-align her spine, which meant she . could not move her torso, and she relied on her parents to help her wash . and get around. Her father, Andrew Mallinson, said: ‘Megan totally missed the top step of the stairs as she was playing on her phone and the next thing we knew she was lying in a heap at the bottom of the stairs. ‘She had fractured her spine in two places and doctors said she may never walk again. ‘If one of the fractures had been one centimetre higher, she would have been paralysed for life.’ Megan, a Leeds Rhinos fan, gave up ballet to play rugby two years ago, and managed to secure a place in the Yorkshire Rugby Union team just before her accident. In the tumble, she also broke a bone in her foot, meaning she struggled to get around. Mr Mallinson, a 45-year-old joiner, said: ‘She had to wear the brace all the time except for when she was in bed and then she had to lie flat on her back. Megan was treated at Leeds General Infirmary where doctors told her that had one of the breaks in her back been a centimetre higher she would have been paralysed. She had to wear a back brace for three months . ‘We had to get up every half an hour during the night to make sure she was lying flat. ‘As soon as she got up she had to put in on so that her spine could realign properly. ‘She couldn’t wear it in the shower because it would have rusted so we had to hold her up and help her wash so that she didn’t flop and bend her spine.’ Megan’s family, including her mum Lorraine, and siblings Thomas, Hayley and Billy, were left to find out whether she would spend the rest of her life in a wheelchair and nervously stayed at her bedside in Leeds General Infirmary. They desperately tried to keep her spirits up by decorating her bed with Leeds Rhinos flags, and she was even sent a signed picture of her favourite player, Kallum Watkins. Megan (centre) told her parents, Andy (back left) and Lorraine (front right) that if she was paralysed she would take up wheelchair rugby. She is also pictured with her sister, Hayley (front left) and brother, Billy (back right) Mrs Mallinson, 45, said: ‘When it happened she was just screaming and shouting so we knew it was bad. ‘The whole time she was in hospital was hell because one minute they were saying she was going to be OK and the next, they were saying things didn’t look good. ‘But Megan was so upbeat, it was unbelievable. Even when she thought she was going to be in a wheelchair for the rest of her life, she told us she was going to take up wheelchair rugby!’ Amazingly after an agonising recovery, Megan has returned to the sport. Mr Mallinson said: ‘When the doctors gave her the all-clear to start back we were very worried but she wanted to do it. Megan says that she was really scared before her return to the rugby pitch because she feared she would injure herself again during a tackle . ‘We said we would let her go back and as the ruby union season had finished she gave rugby league a go. ‘It was very nerve-wracking when she first went out on to the pitch, but she loves it and it’s great to see her having such a good time. ‘She sends out a great message to other girls her age - it’s not just for boys, it’s good fun, it keeps you fit and it keeps kids off the streets.’ Megan, who hopes to play for England one day, said: ‘I was really nervous before my first game back. It was the tackling - I couldn’t just stand there and do nothing but I was a bit scared of hurting myself again. ‘I feel so lucky because it could have gone so differently if that break had been higher. The doctors said one centimetre higher and I would have been paralysed.’","Megan Mallinson broke her back in two places falling down the stairs .

Motor industry bosses must learn to make cars that women want, says Britain’s leading car executive. Firms are failing to make cars that appeal to females - paying more attention to a car’s horsepower than to the effect of high heels on leg-room and whether seats fit women’s backs better than men’s. This is despite the purchasing power of women who, even if they don’t buy a car themselves, are the key influence in seven out of ten car purchases. Dr Andy Palmer, executive vice-president of Nissan, said research showed half of all women are unhappy with their cars and three-quarters feel ‘misunderstood’. A leading motoring expert has claimed that half of all women are unhappy with their cars and three-quarters feel 'misunderstood'. He added there was a need to train more women engineers to design and create the 'female-friendly' cars of the future . There was a need to train more women engineers to design and create the ‘female-friendly cars of the future. And if Britain and Europe didn’t grasp the challenge it will be overtaken by booming China which already educates three times more women engineers than the UK, he said,. Dr Palmer, who lives and works in Japan but whose formative career was in the UK car industry, said: ‘Our industry is failing the largest and most influential customer segment in the world.’ He cited uncomfortable seats that were prone to causing more back pain to women rather than men, the lack of space for prams, and the sexist sales patter of predominantly male showroom sales staff. Engineers must learn to pay more attention to how air conditioning affects a woman’s sandalled feet, or how diamond engagement rings can scratch the car door lacquer. Firms wrongly pay more attention to a car's horsepower than to the effect of high heels on leg-room and whether seats fit women's backs better than men's . And superfluous ‘boy-toy’ gadgets should be replaced by accessories that actually serve a purpose. He added:’Globally, 50 per cent of women are dissatisfied with their car. And a huge 74 per cent of women feel misunderstood by automakers. ‘I know these statistics sound like they are talking about their lovers not their cars, but the reality is our industry is failing the largest and most influential customer segment in the world.’ Dr Palmer, who has been rated by AutoExpress magazine as the most powerful Briton in the global motor industry, said that a step-change was needed and must be more than cosmetic. More women needed to be employed on the shop-floor - as well as the design and marketing departments - to make a real difference. He said: ‘One factor is the lack of women in our business. I’m sure that Nissan is not untypical in employing less than 10per cent female managers in our ranks. ‘But our UK universities produce less than 9 per cent of female engineers each year. That compares with China at about 30 per cent.’ He believes universities could help by running fewer hairdressing courses and training more female engineers who could help to design the female-friendly cars of the future. He said: ‘We need fewer hairdressing courses and more job creation based around those from a technology and mathematical background. ‘If a car company does not have female engineers that is a competitive weakness. Generally the car industry is not seen as female friendly. The best way to address that is to have more females in every part.’ His message was delivered to top car . industry bosses at the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders’ annual motor industry conference in London. Leading motor industry executive Sue Robinson,  director of the national Franchised Dealers’ Association representing 4,000 official car dealers across the UK and part of the of the umbrella Retail Motor Industry Federation said: ’As half the UK’s car buyers are women, it is very important that we recognise that in the manufacturing and buying process. ‘Retailers are working very hard to  encourage more women into the  industry at all levels from senior management to technicians .’ ‘Women are a powerful force in the car market and the industry has improved to and responded to this.’ More women need to be employed on the shop-floor - as well as the design and marketing departments - to make a real difference, said Dr Palmer . Ford is among those firms that does take women drivers seriously and has its own Women’s Product Panel to advise it. Angela Engel, who chairs the Ford panel, said woman ask questions such as could a door handle be grabbed without a ring scratching the lacquer, will high heels mean knees hit steering wheels, and how easy is it to get in the car when wearing a tight skirt. Renault’s customer knowledge department and General Motors’ interior design department are headed by women. Bentley’s engineers have designed ‘pearl pink’ and ‘dragon red’ options for China’s women. The RAC’s technical director, David Bizley said a boom in women drivers over a quarter of a century - now accounting for nearly half - meant car-makers had to adapt. Of the 27.8million drivers on UK roads in 1989, 11.1 million (40 per cent) were women, the remaining 16.7million (60 per cent) were men. Today, of the 35.2million drivers, 16.3million (46.3 per cent) are women, compared to 18.9million (53.7 per cent) who are men. Mr Bizley said: ‘Until comparatively recently there were always far more male than female drivers, which naturally caused a level of bias in terms of vehicle design. But those days have passed.’","Firms are failing to make cars that .

A woman driver crashed and killed her boyfriend when she lost control of her car while trying to turn down the radio during an argument. Laura Hauerslev, 22, and Alec Pearn, 24, had been up late the night before and were not on good terms when they set off on a trip to visit her family. Hauerslev had a headache and the couple argued over what radio station to listen to. Mr Pearn turned the volume up twice, and she turned it down. It was while doing so that Hauerslev took her eyes off road and hit a kerb before losing control of her Citroen Saxo. Mr Pearn, who was not wearing his seat belt, tried to grab the steering wheel but ‘it was too late’, a court heard yesterday. The car, which was travelling at 70mph on a 60mph road and had three tyres with insufficient tread, rolled and hit a tree on the A30 near Bridestowe, Devon, last September. Mr Pearn died of multiple injuries in the collision. Hauerslev escaped prison yesterday when Exeter Crown Court heard Mr Pearn’s family did not want to see her put behind bars. She admitted causing death by careless driving and was given a 12-month community order and told to carry out 240 hours of unpaid work. She was also banned from driving for two years. Judge Francis Gilbert QC told her: ‘I treat it as a tragic accident caused by a momentary loss of concentration.’ The court heard the couple were happy but communicated with ‘jokey arguments’. Prosecutor Peter Coombe said they had been arguing about ‘a most silly thing’ when the accident happened. The judge praised the actions of Michael Cazaly, 50, a passing motorist who risked his life by getting soaked in petrol crawling under wreckage to pull Hauerslev out and try to help Mr Pearn. Hauerslev pleaded guilty at Exeter Crown Court (pictured) to causing death by careless driving and was given a 12 month community order with supervision, ordered to carry out 240 hours of unpaid work and banned from driving for two years . Judge Gilbert commended Mr Cazaly’s courage in ‘putting himself at considerable risk’, saying: ‘He did very well.’ The court was told Mr Cazaly, who could see immediately that Mr Pearn was dead, heard Hauerslev shout: ‘Help, get me out.’ After he helped free her, she asked him how her boyfriend was. Mr Cazaly tried to comfort her by saying he was fine. Later, on learning that Mr Pearn was dead, Hauerslev said: ‘I have killed him.’ Lee Bremridge, defending, said it ‘will live with her for the rest of her life and she is deeply sorry to Alec’s family for what happened and the loss of their son’. After the hearing Mr Pearn’s father Andy and brother Colin hugged Hauerslev. The family said he had been ‘dearly loved, well liked and respected by all who knew him’.","Laura Hauerslev argued with her boyfriend Alec Pearn before crashing car .

Collision: Parents were left furious after police asked the driver of the 70-seat coach to block the path of a car that had failed to stop in Battlebarrow, Cumbria, during the Appleby Horse Fair . The drama, in Appleby, Cumbria, is now under investigation by the local Police and Crime Commissioner. His officers asked the driver of the 70-seat coach to block the path of a car that had failed to stop on its way to the Appleby Horse Fair. It is understood the BMW slowed as it approached the bus and crashed into the rear as it tried to squeeze past. Amanda Daldry, 43, said her daughters Holly, 15, and Jessica, 13, were on the bus, which was taking children home from primary and grammar schools. She said: ‘The kids were filled with adrenaline with what had happened. Excited would be the wrong word. They were agitated. The older ones realised what was happening. Scary: Mother Amanda Daldry, 43, of Sandford, Cumbria, is pictured with her two daughters Holly (right) and Jessica (left). Holly said the younger children on the bus 'started crying and thinking they were all going to die' 'Depending on which side of the bus they were on, some of them saw the car approaching. 'They should not have used a school bus. What would they have done if some of the kids were seriously hurt?’ 'I don't want to die, I'm too young to die' What Sam White, 14, heard younger boys and girls saying . Her daughter Holly said: ‘At first I thought our driver was reversing to turn around but we were waiting for a few minutes and then there was this big thump. ‘We didn’t see the car coming because we were on the other side. 'The little kids started crying and thinking they were all going to die.’ Before the crash, children on board the bus saw officers speak to the driver, who then backed up across the width of the street. Crash: David White, 47, pictured with his son Sam, 14, who was also on the bus at the time of the crash . The passengers said they were not told what was happening and were not allowed to leave the bus during the ordeal. Sam White, 14, said: ‘I saw the car coming up and then the police car behind with blue lights on.’ He added that the young children were screaming: ‘I don’t want to die.’ Cumbria Police say the car was heading for a road beyond the bus which was thronged with spectators, horses and schoolchildren. 'The . police should have anticipated that the car might not stop and should . not have used a school bus as a barricade when there were children on . board' Amanda Daldry, mother of pupils . A statement said: ‘This request was made by police and was not done to totally block the road but placed in a position for the driver to slow down. 'Room was left for him to drive past the rear of the bus.’ It is understood the driver of the car was not going to take part in the fair, which is popular with travelling families and is often dogged by fly-tipping and low-level crime. Police met head teachers Rachel Pearson, of Appleby Primary School, and Andy Lund, of Appleby Grammar, this week. Neither school would comment yesterday and the coach company, Grand Prix Coaches of Brough, has not issued a statement. Big event: The Appleby Horse Fair took place last week in the small Cumbrian market town of Appleby . Police and Crime Commissioner Richard Rhodes said: ‘I met the parents of children involved in the incident and listened to their concerns. 'As a result my office will be conducting a review of the constabulary’s procedures and whether they worked within policy. I will report back in due course.’ It is the latest in a string of controversial incidents involving the Cumbria force, which recently arrested several of its own workers over whistleblowing claims. It came under heavy criticism after civilian police workers were arrested over claims they had leaked details of Mr Rhodes’s expenses to the press.

A woman who shed half her body weight has been rewarded with a gold ring by her husband - complete with a diamond for each of the nine stone she lost. Bev Wright, 53, eventually weighed more than 20 stone after binging on comfort food including biscuits and takeaways. At her heaviest Bev weighed 20st 4lb and rarely left the comfort of her own home. But in 2011 she decided to take action after seeing a picture of herself at her work Christmas party. Bev Wright, 53, from London, lost half her body weight and was awarded a diamond ring for the feat. The ring, that her husband saved up for, contains one diamond for each stone she lost . She changed her diet and started going to the gym three times a week and within two years managed to get down to a healthy 11st 4lb - hitting her nine stone loss target. But Bev didn’t realise husband Gary, 54. a London underground technician, had secretly been saving to treat his wife when she reached her goal. In the days before she hit her target he went to the jewellers to buy a special diamond ring - with a shining rock for each stone she lost. Mum-of-two Bev, from Chatham, Kent, said: 'I have been overweight all my life. I used to binge on chocolate and biscuits. The usual suspects really. Bev didn't know that her husband Gary, 54, had secretly saved to treat his wife when she reached her weight loss goal . Bev's weight spiralled out of control when her two-year-old son . Christopher was diagnosed with cancer in 1991. The anxiety and stress caused the teaching assistant's diet to suffer and she binged on biscuits . 'I always struggled with my weight and used to lose two stone then put it back on. I saw a photo of me at a Christmas party and that made me realise how much I had put on. 'I had gone 50 and was still overweight so thought I needed to change. The ring will always be a reminder and I never want to put this weight back on again. 'I’ve got so much more energy. I go to the gym three times a week and I walk everywhere.' It wasn't until Bev saw a photo of herself taken at a work party that she decided that she needed to take action to lose weight . Bev lost the weight by eating healthily, going to the gym and walking everywhere instead of relying the car. She says that since she has lost the weight she has much more energy . Bev’s weight spiralled out of control when her two-year-old son Christopher was diagnosed with cancer in 1991. The anxiety and stress of coping with his sickness and the nights sat by his bedside in Great Ormond Street Hospital meant the teaching assistant never had a balanced diet. And when Christopher tragically passed away in August, 1992, at the age of two, Bev found it difficult to find the motivation to lose the pounds. She said: “I have been overweight all my life but when Christopher was diagnosed with cancer it certainly didn’t help. 'It was the stress of thinking of him up in Great Ormond Street at a time that I was pregnant with my second child.' Bev, a teaching assistant, enlisted the help of son Simon, 21, and daughter Angie, 19, to beat her weight problems and also joined Slimming World. She added: 'The kids have noticed, particularly some of the children where I might have taught their siblings before. 'There are still photos of me on our board at school and they all say ‘I can’t believe that’s you’. 'Gary has always supported me. I don’t think he really thought I was going to stick to it but he never mentioned anything. 'I just think it’s because I can eat normal food.

A former nurse with Parkinson’s disease is studying a ‘memory book’ created for him by his ten-year-old son to help ward off dementia. Chris Ley, 45, was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in 2011 - five years after suffering a stroke. He feared he would develop memory loss, which can be a symptom of the disease, so decided to ward off dementia by ‘training the brain’ with pictures of his family. Joseph Ley, 10, created a 'memory book' for his father, Chris, who suffers from Parkinson's disease and fears he will develop memory loss. Mr Ley says he uses the book to 'train his brain' and ward off dementia . Mr Ley, who was forced to give up work as a male nurse following his diagnosis, is now able to examine pictures of his past thanks to Joseph’s ‘memory book’. The book contains pictures of each of Mr Ley’s five children’s first day of school as well as photos of their birthday parties and of family holidays. So far, Joseph has collected dozens pictures of his mother Elaine, 44, and siblings Ethan, 15, Rebecca, 13, Rachel, seven, and Malachi, four. The youngster, who also helps care for his dad, said he wanted to surprise his dad with the touching gift. He said: ‘I wanted to make it a surprise for my dad. I felt really excited and happy to tell him. I did it for all the family. ‘Like the rest of my siblings, I like to help. I pick my dad up when he’s fallen over, fetch his clothes and medication for him, cut up his food at dinner time and help with jobs around the house.’ The book contains pictures of each of Mr Ley's five children's first day of school as well as of their birthday parties and of family holidays. He says it reminds him of who he was before he fell ill . Mr Ley said: ‘I was overwhelmed and surprised that my son had done something so nice for me. ‘He is the kindest boy and always helps me. ‘Every activity we do we take photos to build memories so this will make a wonderful one. ‘I will be right there by his side to have my picture taken with him. ‘The symptoms of my disease are stable with medication but I am concerned that in the future I could suffer memory loss and I want to train my brain to stay alert. ‘By looking through the old pictures of my family it reminds me who I was before my stroke and before I was diagnosed with Parkinson’s. Mr Ley says that he was 'overwhelmed and surprised' that his son had done something so kind. He says he hopes that reminding his brain who he was will help him in the future . ‘I know my symptoms will get worse in the future but I want to fight back. I was not always like this and my children know that too. ‘I’m not someone who can just sit back and accept what is happening to me so I feel by reminding my brain who I was can help me in the future.’ The family were forced to relocate last year from Dundee, Scotland, back to Mr Ley’s native Beeston, in Nottinghamshire, to receive support from relatives. About 127,000 people - one in 500 - in the UK suffer from Parkinson’s disease, which is caused by a lack of dopamine in the brain. Most sufferers are over 50, but one in 20 are under 40 – these are known as early onset cases. The most common symptoms include shaking, slow movement and rigidity, but mild memory loss and cognitive impairment can also occur.","Joseph Ley has compiled a book of family photos for his father, Chris, 45 .

A group of engineering students at Cambridge University managed to get an Austin Seven car on to a roof, baffling fellow students, faculty and police, in June 1958. Until now, exactly how the car got onto the Senate House 70 feet up in the air has been a closely guarded secret - until today. Original prank: The group of engineering students never revaled how they got the Austin Seven on the roof of the Senate House in 1958 . Exactly 55 years after the . original prank was pulled off, a group of cadet officers managed to . recreate the stunt at Jesus Green, Cambridge. A team from the University's Officer Training Corps raised a similar Austin Seven off the ground using ropes and a log structure. It took the group just ten minutes to lift the car 20 feet with a gyn - a three-legged frame with a rope and four pulleys which is used for hoisting loads vertically. The group had originally planned to fully recreate the joke using a 70 feet platform to represent the roof of Senate House, but the idea had to be abandoned after it was deemed unsafe. Heave ho: Members of Cambridge University Officer Training Corps hoist a car in the air in a bid to recreate the classic Senate House Austin Seven prank of 1958 . All tied up: The cadets tied up the car to a gyn, a method which has long been suspected to have been what the original pranksters used . The engineering students behind the 1958 joke never fully explained how they got the car onto the roof, but has revealed in the past that it took several distractions, such as girls lifting their skirts, to get away with the prank undiscovered. After a week-long battle to hoist the Austin Seven back down from the roof, police, firefighters and civil defence units  were forced to give in and took the car to pieces with blowtorches. Following this weekend's recreation, staff sergeant Carl Webber said: ‘There were a few technical problems but in the end we got the car up in ten minutes. ‘We explained how it was done and had a lot of interest from intrigued people coming over to ask what was going on.’ Cambridge Mayor Councillor Paul Saunders, said: ‘The re-enactment is a real tribute to an event that is now known as part of the mythology of Cambridge. ‘It's great that the Royal Engineers and the officer cadets came to hoist the car up as otherwise it would be impossible. Quick lift: After roping the car to the winch system, the officer cadet team members were able to get the car into the air in just ten minutes . ‘I would be quite horrified to see a similar stunt happen but I think we are more aware of the dangers now. ‘In the high spirits of the 50's after the war it is understandable but we can't afford to damage any of our old buildings today.’ Basil Jaques, a committee member of Cambridge Austin 7 and Vintage Car Club, said attempts were made to invite the original perpetrators of the prank. He said: ‘We did try to get them to come along but they are now scattered across the country and are elderly. ‘It was a good little show and we had a great response.’","Cambridge Uni prank saw Austin Seven placed on a roof in 1958 .

A family has called the police claiming their six-year-old daughter had five of her teeth removed when she went into hospital for surgery on her legs. Sarah Morrison suffers from a rare type of brittle bone disease which has seen her suffer from over 200 broken bones since she was born. She was admitted to Sheffield Children’s Hospital for surgery to have metal rods inserted to make her limbs stronger, but her furious parents say they were ‘horrified’ to learn five of her teeth had also been taken out. Sarah Morrison, six, who has brittle bone disease, was admitted to Sheffield Children's Hospital to have rods inserted into her legs to make them stronger. Her parents claim doctors also removed five of her teeth . Sheffield Children’s Hospital says the teeth were loose baby teeth which needed to be removed as they ‘posed a serious risk to Sarah’s airway’ during surgery, and that her parents spoke to a clinician beforehand about all the care she may need. However, Sarah’s parents, Philip Morrison and Sonia McCrossan, dispute this and the hospital is now carrying out an internal review. Mr Morrison, 37, said: ‘After the surgery I was outside the hospital when my partner rang me in a very erratic state, crying and screaming. ‘At that point I thought Sarah had died. I ran down to the recovery room where I first got a glimpse of Sarah with a mouth full of blood. I was horrified. ‘They didn’t mention at any point that her teeth might be taken out - it wasn’t even on the operation consent form. ‘The hospital is adamant that baby teeth were taken. But two of them were adult teeth, I know because I have the baby teeth at home. Her parents, Philip Morrison and Sonia McCrossan, claim that two of the teeth that were taken out were adult teeth and say that they have contacted the police about the situation . ‘We feel mortified and let down.’ Sarah was born with osteogenesis imperfect – a congenital brittle bone condition - and suffered 30 rib fractures in the womb. Doctors initially gave her just two days to live but she defied expectations to survive. Mr Morrison, and his partner Sonia McCrossan, moved from Ireland to Sheffield to be closer to bone specialists at the children’s hospital but they’re now planning to move her to another hospital. Mr Morrison said the family were told a dentist would examine Sarah’s teeth, but not that any would be removed. He also said the teeth taken were not loose. Sheffield Children's Hospital (pictured) says that the teeth were milk teeth and that they were removed because they were loose and posed a serious risk to Sarah's airway while she was under anaesthetic . He said: ‘She isn’t going back there again. ‘Sarah has been going mad about the missing teeth. She keeps putting her tongue up there saying “they stole my teeth”. ‘It’s not the fact her teeth were removed. She has a gastro tube and it’s been difficult trying to get her to feed, now this will set us back.’ A spokesman for South Yorkshire Police said they had been ‘made aware of an alleged incident’ at the hospital. Police are to be kept informed during the hospital review but are not investigating. The hospital says that it is carrying out an internal review but that no staff members have been disciplined . A spokesman for Sheffield Children’s NHS Foundation Trust, said: ‘The care given to this patient was done in her best interests. ‘She has a complex condition and had come in for a surgical orthopaedic procedure, during which five baby teeth needed to be removed while she was under general anaesthetic. ‘They were very loose and were judged to pose a serious risk to her airway. No harm was caused to her by the removal of these baby teeth. ‘Her parents spoke to a clinician before any surgery was carried out and the care their child may have needed while undergoing surgery was discussed. ‘As an issue has now been raised by her parents, we will review this as we do with any concern. ‘No action has been taken against any members of staff. ‘We understand her parents have raised this as an issue with the police and we will keep them updated as we would with any incident.’","Sarah Morrison, who suffers with brittle bone disease, went to Sheffield Children's Hospital to undergo leg surgery .

It's every shopper's worst nightmare, driving around in circles looking for somewhere to park and then having to squeeze into a small gap between two other cars. But it seems that Swedish car firm Volvo has finally solved that problem. The Gothenburg-based manufacturer has unveiled new self-parking valet technology that lets the car do all the work for you – without the driver even having to be inside the car. Scroll down for video . Auto-pilot: Swedish car manufacturer Volvo has produced new technology that enables a car to find a parking space and park itself - without the driver even being in the car . At the click of button: The new technology is activated using a smart phone app. The driver gets out of the car and instructs the car to park . Easy: Instead of having to squeeze their car between two other vehicles, drivers can relax and let the built in autonomous driver do all the hard work . The technology not only finds a space for you , it drives to it and parks the car in it – while you’re on your way to the shops or your office. The smart, driver-less car also reacts safely and smoothly with other cars and pedestrians in the car park. The driver simply gets out of the car and instructs it to find a space via their smart phone and it will follow their command. Like something out of Knight Rider, when the driver returns to the vehicle they simply use their smart phone again to alert the system, and it will start the engine and come right to the driver of its own accord. Volvo’s ingenious  autonomous parking system will undergo public trials next week. Safe: The new technology uses sensors so that it is able to see when pedestrians are walking in its vicinity and stops to let them walk by . Clever: The car will even spot when another car is vacating a space and nip into it . Perfect parking: The car's sensors enable it to park perfectly in the centre of the empty bay . Thomas Broberg, senior safety adviser for the Volvo Car Group said: ‘Autonomous Parking is a technology that relieves the driver of the time-consuming task of finding a vacant parking space. 'The driver just drops the vehicle off at the entrance to the car park and picks it up in the same place later.’ He explained: ‘Transmitters in the road infrastructure tell the driver when the service is available. The driver then uses a mobile phone application to activate the Autonomous Parking and walks away from the car. ‘ . The car users sensors to pin-point its position and navigate to a free parking space. Fetch: When the driver returns to the car, they simply instruct the vehicle's technology to pick them up and it drives from the space to where they are . On show: The car will undergo public tests next week after its unveiling . The procedure is reversed when the driver comes back to pick up the car. The new Valet Volvo combines autonomous driving technology with sensors and automatic braking to ‘see’ other objects such as cars or people and interact with them safely. So if a car pulls out suddenly from a nearby bay, it can stop and wait for it to pass – even having the awareness to spot the newly vacant bay. Mr Broberg said: 'Our approach is based on the principle that autonomously driven cars must be able to move safely in environments with non-autonomous vehicles and unprotected road users.' Volvo said its aim is to be the world leader in the field of autonomous driving and to put the technology into real-world cars within a few year. It said that by the end of 2014, the all new Volvo XC90 model will feature elements of autonomous steering.","The Valet Volvo uses autonomous driving technology and sensors .

Heart problems - such as those which are believed to have killed Sopranos star James Gandolfini - are the leading cause of death for those on holiday, it has today been claimed . Heart problems - such as those which are believed to have killed Sopranos star James Gandolfini -  are one of the leading causes of death for holidaymakers, it has today been claimed. While the stress-free environment of a summer holiday seems an unlikely backdrop to have a heart attack, experts warn that the crowds, polluted air, extreme temperatures, unusual foods, excessive alcohol and an increased amount of exercise found abroad could all contribute. Actor James Gandolfini, 51, who died earlier this week, was on holiday in Rome when it is believed he suffered a cardiac arrest. Officials have yet to confirm the cause of death with an autopsy. According to a 2003 paper published in journal Psychosomatic Medicine, a holiday includes 'out-of-the-ordinary activities' and could be responsible for placing extra physical and mental stress on the body. It said this can trigger a heart attack or other life-threatening heart problems. People can also become unhealthily upset when their dream holiday does not turn out to be quite how they had expected. The study looked at 92 Dutch people who had heart attacks while on holiday . It found that heart attacks were more likely to occur during the first two days of the break than on other days, Live Science reports. Dr. Erik Altman, director of electrophysiology at the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Southside Hospital in New York, said there was growing evidence suggesting it is common for those on holiday to have heart attacks. He said: 'The physical and emotional aspect of traveling and vacationing may need to be brought to people's attention. 'While we are on vacation, we are still at risk of heart disease.' While the stress free environment of a summer holiday seems an unlikely backdrop to have a heart attack, experts warn that the crowds, polluted air, extreme temperatures, unusual foods, excessive alcohol and an increased amount of exercise found abroad could all contribute . Altman said it could also be because people in 'holiday mode' may eat too much, drink too much and forget to take their medication. The details of the cause of Mr Gandolfini's suspected attack are not yet known, but news reports have suggested it could be in part down to his weight and smoking habit. Dr Altman has said that while heart attacks are not uncommon on holiday, overall, people who take regular vacations are less likely to die from heart attacks. He suggested people who have health conditions should 'adjust their holiday to suit their needs.'","Heart problems are one of the .

A 'safe play scheme’ that encourages parents to apply for their street to be closed off to traffic so their children can play safely, has been launched. The Play Streets initiative will allow children to play on their car-free street for a few hours every fortnight without parents having to worry about traffic. The scheme, introduced in Reading, applies to residential streets only and has been introduced as an opportunity for neighbours to get to know each other better and foster community spirit. Safe game: Parents can apply to have their street closed for traffic for a few hours so children living in the neighbourhood can play safely together on the road . The scheme will go through a trial period of one year, Reading Borough Council said, and applicants need supporting signatures from around two-thirds of their neighbours to be considered for approval.

Dr Ikram Malik, 75, died after his trouser leg became caught in a passing car as he crossed the road in Nelson, Lancashire . A family doctor who was honoured by the Queen fell to his death in a freak road accident after his trouser leg became entangled in the wheel of a passing car. GP Dr Ikram Malik, 75, was crossing the road to attend prayers at his local mosque when his clothing became caught under the front passenger wheel of a passing Vauxhall Astra. Dr Malik shouted to the driver to stop - banging his hands on the side of the car - but he fell backwards, hitting his head on the kerb, and died in hospital five days later. Details of the tragedy emerged at an inquest into Dr Malik’s death where his family criticised police for their investigation. The GP, who received an MBE in 1999 for his voluntary work, was still practising and in 2009 had received an award from then Home Secretary Jacqui Smith for being one of the 'unsung heroes' of the Muslim community in Britain. His wife, Raisa, who was also a doctor had just retired, and two of their three children were also GPs, the inquest heard. The tragedy occurred in September last year after Dr Malik, who moved to Britain from his native Pakistan in the 1960s, began his regular Friday journey to prayers from his surgery in Nelson, Lancashire. He was on his way to Markazi Jamia Ghousi Mosque when he stepped off the pavement on Pendle Street and became entangled with the Astra which was moving off from the junction at a roundabout. Driver Caroline Schofield, a school worker, was waiting to move off and told the inquest she had been looking to her right and had not seen Dr Malik on her left. She told Burnley Coroner's Court: 'I came to a stop at the roundabout. I indicated to turn right and looked to the right, another vehicle indicated to go left. The inquest heard that Dr Malik was at a roundabout in Nelson, pictured, when the accident happened . 'I started to set off. I am confident I hadn’t noticed him. As I set off I saw him, he put his hands on the side of my car where the mirror is, below the wing mirror at the side of the car. He shouted ""Stop"". 'He seemed to lose his balance, he seemed to fall and stumble to the ground, he wasn’t at the front of the car . 'He was off the footpath, he must have been standing in the road. 'I just stopped, I had just moved slightly. He seemed to lose his balance, he stumbled and he fell to the floor. It happened so quickly.' She added: 'I didn’t look to my left. You give way to the right. It was a roundabout - you don’t expect pedestrians to step off a pavement on a roundabout. It wasn’t a pelican crossing.' She added that her wheels must only have 'turned twice', and that after the collision she got out of her car and saw Dr Malik. Driver Caroline Schofield, left, is not blamed by Dr Malik's wife Raisa or daughter Shazia Malik, for the accident . Another witness Leonard Tolliday said: 'He stepped off the kerb in front of the lady in the car. The traffic was clear and she moved gradually forward. 'He put out his arms onto the bonnet and fell back and his head hit the road. It was horrendous. I could see his trouser leg was trapped under the car.' Police later said Mrs Schofield was not to blame for the tragedy. But Dr Malik’s daughter Shazia, who is also a doctor, criticised the way the investigation was carried out after she discovered it had taken four weeks for the driver of the Astra to be interviewed. She said: 'The investigation process I feel has been inconsistent, incomplete and inadequate. It just makes me feel that the evidence available could have been better. Despite his advanced years, Dr Malik was still working as a family GP at this surgery in Nelson, Lancashire . Dr Malik's wife Raisa, left with relative, was a doctor, as are two of their three children, the inquest heard . 'I was always on the back foot looking for witnesses because the key is getting them at the time. I’m just so upset.' East Lancashire Coroner Richard Taylor returned an accidental death verdict and said: 'I believe Dr Malik felt that he had sufficient time to cross that road. 'The contact between Mrs Schofield’s vehicle and Dr Malik is accepted as being slight, the car stopped almost immediately and somehow Dr Malik’s trouser leg was caught underneath the car. 'It is very difficult to say exactly how that happened but as a result he was unable to move out of the way with any degree of safety, and as a result of that he clearly overbalanced causing his fatal injury.' Dr Malik was chairman of a number of a number of local community groups and a former vice-chairman of the National Association of the Racial Equality Council’s North West region. After the case Dr Malik’s son Dr Shahzad Malik said: 'His death was not only a tragic loss for the family but the Pakistani community. 'We bear no vengeance towards the lady involved.' 'At his funeral there was a quiet dignity which is how he led his life and which I hope we composed ourself the same today. We tried to compose ourselves in a way that he would have himself, with the same quiet dignity as my father would have wanted. 'It is not to say that the wounds are not still very very fresh.'","Dr Ikram Malik, 75, of Nelson, Lancashire, was on his way to local mosque .

It is a community with mass unemployment, high alcohol use – and a frightening reliance on ‘happy pills’. In the South Wales borough of Blaenau Gwent, as many as one in six are taking antidepressants, it was claimed yesterday. Campaigners said it highlighted the ‘disturbing’ issue of how high amounts of antidepressants are being handed out in deprived areas across Britain. In Blaenau Gwent, the NHS issues almost 10,000 prescriptions for the drugs each month – in an area with an adult population of 60,000. Depressed: In the South Wales borough of Blaenau Gwent, pictured, as many as one in six are taking antidepressants, it was claimed yesterday . Hooked: In Blaenau Gwent, the NHS issues almost 10,000 prescriptions for antidepressant drugs each month . The proportion could be slightly lower than one in six as some prescriptions may be repeat orders for the same patient and individuals may receive more than one kind of antidepressant. But Dr David Bailey, chairman of the Welsh GPs Committee, said: ‘This is a very worryingly high number of antidepressants. ‘Unfortunately depression is closely associated with deprivation and unemployment. This is very disturbing and clearly something which needs to be addressed.’ Wales has the highest rate of antidepressant use in the UK. The number of prescriptions per head rose by nearly 8 per cent last year, with a similar increase in England and Scotland. Dark place: Nestled in the South Wales Valleys is Blaina (pictured), which is in Blaenau Gwent where up to one in six people are on anti-depressants . A lack of opportunities in the areas, which has been badly hit by the recent recession, may be part of the problem in the area, experts say . The old steelworks in Ebbw Vale during it's demolition - the area has 7.5 per cent unemployment and a higher level on benefits . Government statistics for 2011 show that in Wales there were 3.8million prescriptions of antidepressants for a population of just over 3million, the equivalent of 1.24 per person. In England there were 46.7million prescriptions for a population of 53million, or 0.88 per person – at a cost, according to the Health and Social Care Information Centre, of £270million. Blaenau Gwent, one of the most economically depressed parts of the UK, has as its centre the town of Ebbw Vale – where NHS founder Aneurin Bevan was MP. It has 7.5 per cent unemployment and 8.2 per cent on Jobseeker’s Allowance. Levels: Wales has the highest rate of antidepressant use in the UK - but it is also rising in England and Scotland . Experts in Blaenau Gwent also believe that a breakdown in family relationships means that people may also be getting less support . GP Dr Greg Graham said: ‘The Welsh valleys have seen the loss of mining and heavy industries . ‘There remains a lot of low morale, issues of poor health and lack of opportunities, especially at the moment. Society is also not so strong, in terms of close-knit family which could offer the support to people who are depressed, as perhaps used to happen.’ The Blaenau Gwent branch of mental health charity Mind warned that antidepressants can be seen as ‘the quick solution’ by GPs. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence says antidepressants should ‘not routinely be offered’ to those with persistent mild or moderate depression. It recommends ‘talking cures’ such as cognitive behaviour therapy. But Dr Graham said: ‘What we do as GPs is prescribe, because there aren’t sufficient support services there to address the situation.’ In Ebbw Vale yesterday, few people were surprised at the high local reliance on antidepressants. Short term: The Blaenau Gwent branch of mental health charity Mind warned that antidepressants can be seen as ¿the quick solution¿ by GPs . On the map: In Blaenau Gwent, the NHS issues almost 10,000 prescriptions for the drugs each month ¿ in an area with an adult population of 60,000 . Unemployed Michaela Davies, 32, said: ‘I’m surprised it is only one in six. Generations ago this area produced the steel and coal that made Britain great. But that is all forgotten by the politicians now and we are just dumped.’ Former steelworker Brian Protheroe, 62, said: ‘A lot of my generation are on the pills just to get through week by week. ‘But what is there for the kids coming through? Pretty soon there will be even more people popping pills just to face the day.’ At Mind’s drop-in centre in Brynmawr, one woman told a reporter she first started taking pills ‘for her nerves’ almost 40 years ago, adding: ‘When you haven’t got the money to go out... the depression sets in.’","In Blaenau Gwent, Wales, the NHS issues 10,000 prescriptions each month .

Over a third of women worldwide will experience physical or sexual violence, a new study has revealed. Research found 35 per cent of women across the globe will be the victim of either intimate or non-partner violence. And intimate partner violence is the most common type of assault against females, affecting 30 per cent of all women. Experts say that urgent action is needed to address the global problems of violence against women. Violence can lead to misuse of alcohol amongst women, sexually transmitted infections and unwanted pregnancies and abortion . As well as releasing the findings of the report, the World Health Organisation (WHO) detailed the impacts of such violence on women. The study found health problems ranging from broken bones to pregnancy-related complications, mental problems and impaired social functioning. Injury, and even death, are the most serious consequences of violence, but it can also double the chances of developing depression. Meanwhile, violence can lead to misuse of alcohol amongst women, sexually transmitted infections and unwanted pregnancies and abortion. The study found too that women who experience partner violence have a 16 per cent greater chance of giving birth to a low-weight baby. Disturbing: 'Significant others' are responsible for between a third and a half of all female murders, compared to just one in 16 male killings . What's more, the research showed the need for all sectors to help eliminate tolerance for violence against women and provide better support for women. The study was done in partnership with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the South African Medical Research Council. Professor Charlotte Watts, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: 'This new data shows violence against women is extremely common. 'We urgently need to invest in prevention to address the underlying causes of this global women's health problem.' According to the research, a fear of stigma prevents many women from reporting non-partner sexual violence. Though the review also found that 7.2 per cent of women globally had reported non-partner sexual violence. Dr Margaret Chan, from WHO, said: 'These findings send a powerful message that violence against women is a global health problem of epidemic proportions. 'We also see that the world's health systems can and must do more for women who experience violence.' And Dr Claudia Garcia-Moreno, from WHO, added: 'The report findings show violence greatly increases women's vulnerability to a range of short and long-term health problems. 'It highlights the need for the health sector to take violence against women more seriously.'","Study by World Health Organisation found that intimate partner violence is the most common type of assault, affecting 30% of females .

Wolf urine and lion roars are being used by transport bosses in northern Japan to tackle the growing problem of collisions caused by deer. The number of accidents caused by the animal has more than doubled in Hokkaido - the northernmost of Japan's four main islands - in the past ten years. As a result, transport officials have taken drastic action. As well as spraying wolf urine near roads and railways they will also be broadcasting the roar of lions to try to keep the deer away. Japanese deer are seen in a snow-covered field in the district of Kushiro, in Hokkaido, Japan . The urine is being imported from the United States to spray on the island's highways. A spokesman for Nexco East, which runs the island's highways, said: 'Even though we have increased the height of fences to 2.5 metres (8.3 feet) from 1.5 metres, fences sometimes break because of heavy snow, so we need this stop-gap measure while mending them. 'The effect lasts about a month, but it won't be effective forever because deer get used to the smell.' The deer population in Hokkaido was nearly wiped out in the early 20th century because of overhunting and sometimes brutal winters. A wolf scent-marks its territory. The urine is being imported from the United States to tackle the deer problem . But conservation efforts - and the extinction of the indigenous wild wolf population - led to their recovery. There are now around 650,000 deer on the island, sometimes wreaking havoc with farmland and transport systems. Hokkaido Railway Co earlier this year erected equipment that broadcasts the roar of lions in an effort to keep the timid animals away from its tracks, a spokesman said. He added there were 2,581 incidents involving deer last year, a figure that had doubled in less than a decade.","Wolf urine sprayed near roads and railways to reduce accidents .

Speed: The pilot leans out of the window of the stranded Boeing 737 that ran onto the grass beside the runway. An investigation has found the aircraft broke recommended speed limits . The plane was moving at 23mph when it landed last September. The recommended guideline is 11mph when taxiing on a runway. An Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) report has concluded that the plane’s pilot was rushing to make way for another aircraft that was travelling behind.

Gobble a banana while riding the escalator, pause for a coffee in between outlets, have a quick power nap in a changing cubicle... Everyone has their own way of staying in high spirits and bountiful energy while doing that most exhausting of activities: shopping. But perhaps what you really need to be doing is long-term training on the specific muscles you use while lugging bags and boxes up and down the high-street and repeatedly lifting dresses up and over your head. And now you can. The Shopper's Workout will strengthen the core muscles you use while on a shopping trip, making it easier for you to lug bags up escalators and run for the bus while laden with groceries . A London gym has created a retail-inspired work-out for the shopaholic in us all, a 30-minute routine packed with lunges, planks, squats and Russian twists, each promising to tighten and strengthen your 'shopping muscles'. The shopping work-out begins with a 10-minute warm-up walk on the treadmill - the equivalent of waking to the bus stop. The speed then cranks up for 10 minutes on the stepper (imagine you're running up the escalators to beat the sales rush). You then launch into three sets of 20 lunges while holding a set of dumbbells: just imagine picking dropped T-shirts off the floor while holding a screaming child over your shoulders. After a few months of the shopper's workout you'll be able to strut confidently down Oxford Street half-naked like these chaps, the glamorous Dream Idols . Drop into the plank and hold yourself there for one minute, recreating the scene in which you're lying on the changing room floor struggling to squeeze yourself into a pair of skinny jeans. Now it's time for squats. Hold a barbell over your shoulders to make more difficult and drop into 12 repetitions, for three sets. Envisage yourself reaching for shoes on the low shelf. Lots of times. Then throw yourself into 30 seconds of Russian twists - the same movement you do while pulling on jeggings - followed by three sets of 12 kettlebell Sumo squats, to strengthen your bag-carrying arm muscles. Exhaustion such as this will be a thing of the past once you've perfected the work-out and trained your muscles to carry heavy bags with ease and take escalator steps two at a time . At last it's time for a round of Swissball crunches to strengthen your running-for-the-bus core, and then a 10-minute cool down on the cross-trainer, the equivalent of the long, awkward trudge home with your shopping bags. The retail-routine has been created by easyGym, the new premium-budget gym from easyJet founder Stelios, to celebrate the launch of its new Oxford Street flagship, where membership costs £19.99 per month. Paul Lorimer-Wing, CEO of easyGym said:  'EasyGym Oxford Street is our most ambitious project ever, offering fantastic facilities at a fraction of the price of the big boys.  We hope our new shopper's work out will give shoppers a leg up too.'

But the suggestion that Google’s vast stores of data could soon help replace it probably does the trick. Internet search engines could be used as a source of cheap information on citizens’ lives, interests and movements, a government paper has suggested. What does Google know about you? The company's . vast stores of data could replace the census in a plan to use the . internet as a source of cheap data on citizens' lives, interests and . movements, it has been suggested . It could spell the end of the national census, which was first conducted in 1801 and has been carried out every ten years since, apart from during the Second World War. It aims to cover every home in the country but the last census – the 52-page giant in 2011 – missed out three-and-a-half million people. It cost nearly half a billion pounds, a price the Treasury considers too high. But the possibility of abolishing it in favour of information taken in part from controversial internet multinationals risks deep rows over privacy and David Cameron’s apparent closeness to Google. The company is suffering major damage to its reputation following its slowness to curb child pornography and its failure to pay more than minimal taxes in Britain. Links: The plan has raised questions about David Cameron's closeness to Google, which has been slammed for paying just minimal taxes in Britain . There also remain questions over its close links to Mr Cameron, some of his aides, and some ministers. The Office for National Statistics has been working out ways of replacing the census with ‘administrative data’ from NHS, tax and benefit records, the electoral register, school and university rolls and other public sources. But officials also want to use information from the private sector. ONS documents have canvassed the idea of tapping into companies with databases each covering more than ten million people. Firms mentioned include Tesco, the E.ON energy supplier, Thames Water, and Nationwide. The idea of using Google and other search engines to replace the census was raised in a document produced by the Government Statistical Service which will be discussed at a behind-closed-doors conference today. The meeting is mainly concerned with Beyond 2011, the Whitehall programme for finding an alternative to the traditional census. A session of the conference will be devoted to ‘alternative data sources’ which ‘include sources like internet search or transaction data and information collected and held by commercial organisations’. One example of how this could work is Google Trends, a publicly-available website which shows the most popular searches broken down by subject and location. It could be used to find data on migration by, for example, checking the number of searches for jobs in Britain made in Romania. Both Google and the ONS said yesterday that the two sides have held no meetings. A spokesman for Google said: ‘Google Trends is a publicly available service. We would never sell third party information.’","Proposal has raised questions over the Prime Minister's links to Google .

Costly: Airlines and holiday websites are charging travellers up to £160 for minor amendments to tickets . Airlines and holiday websites are taking advantage of travellers by charging as much as £160 for even minor amendments to tickets. Recent studies have revealed huge increases in fares, particularly around school holidays, however the carriers are using stealth charges to add to the burden. Consumer champions at Which? found many firms are using smallprint rules to impose a charge for name changes where there has been a mistake or spelling error. For example, Ryanair charges £110 per name change if the correction is made online and as much as £160 via a call centre or at the airport while minor errors may be charged at £10 through the reservations centre. Monarch charges £100 per name for online changes or £120 at call centre but corrected spelling errors free of charge. Both carriers said customers would also have to pay extra if the ticket price had risen since the original booking. Researchers at Which? Travel were contacted by Frederick Hubbard, 70, who realised that he had missed an ‘e’ out of his name when booking a flight to the US through Lastminute.com. He thought it would be a simple matter to correct, however he was told by the website that there would be an astonishing £45 admin charge. Mr Hubbard was also told that he would need to rebook the flight at £540 and then wait for a refund of his original payment, which could take up to four months. ‘The whole principle of having to pay a charge as well as buy another ticket and wait that long for a refund, just to make a small spelling change, is lunacy,’ he said. ‘It could be £540 I don’t have.’ Mr Hubbard said his frustration grew after he contacted the airline concerned, KLM, which told him that if he had booked direct, he could have changed the name and had the money refunded within four weeks. A Which? spokesman said: ‘Being charged for minor name changes to airline tickets, and sometimes having to buy another ticket, is a recurrent complaint among consumers.’ Expensive: Ryanair charges £110 per name change if the correction is made online and as much as £160 via a call centre or at the airport while minor errors may be charged at £10 through the reservations centre . She said the European Commission is looking to reform the rules to put an end to ‘punitive’ administration fees for spelling errors. The spokesman said: ‘It says airlines should provide reasonable corrections of booking errors free of charge up to 48 hours before departure.’ Mr Hubbard’s complaints to Lastminute.com paid dividends and he got his refund within a week, however the firm’s standard terms say the delay can be 16 weeks. The firm said it accepted that 16 weeks was a ‘considerable’ time but it was a ‘worst case’ scenario based on the length of time airlines could take to provide refunds. Minor changes: Monarch charges £100 per name for online changes or £120 at call centre but corrected spelling errors free of charge . The Which? study found not all airlines charge as much as the ‘budget’ carrier Ryanair, with its maximum fee of £160. British Airways has no charge to correct spelling mistakes, although the traveller will have to fund any increase in taxes and fees if they have increased since the original booking. EasyJet allows people to correct spelling errors for free, but it charges £35 for a name change. Virgin Atlantic charges £30 for spelling corrections, while Thomas Cook charges £20, although this may be waived if done within 48 hours of booking.","Which? found firms using smallprint rules to charge for name changes .

"By . Helen Pow . PUBLISHED: . 14:32 EST, 26 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:54 EST, 26 June 2013 . A Chicago father-of-two, who recently came out as homosexual, is accused of murdering his wife in an elaborate fake hijacking in order to get an insurance payout. Darron Brewer, 26, allegedly convinced his younger brother, Dujuan Powe, to hijack his family's car and force 22-year-old Kenyatae Collier-Brewer into the trunk where she was shot dead as the couple's children were in the back seat. The brothers, who are now on trial, then planned to collect on a spousal life insurance policy provided through Brewer's employer, the U.S. National Guard, that would no longer be valid if the gay man ended his marriage, prosecutors said. Accused: Darron Brewer, pictured, is on trial for the murder of his wife Kenyatae Collier-Brewer . Those benefits 'were about to end because their marriage was going to end,' Cook County Assistant State's Attorney Jeff Allen told jurors in opening statements on Monday. 'Greed is the only word to describe why Kenyatae had to die.' He added that Brewer's boyfriend will testify during the trial. According to DNAInfo, police found Collier-Brewer's dead body in the trunk of the car after the October 25, 2009 slaying. Brewer called 911 to report the hijacking and gave the location of the vehicle. The gun used to take her life was found hidden under a pile of mattresses at Powe's girlfriend's home, implicating the brothers, who each claim their innocence and blame the other. Victim: Kenyatae Collier-Brewer, 22, was found dead in the family's car after the October 25, 2009 slaying . The pair had in fact planned to kill the young mother earlier in October, according to Allen, but failed. Allen said Powe, who goes by the name 'Scooter,' was supposed to surprise Collier-Brewer in her home and 'choke her to death.' 'He saw her coming out of the bathroom, he couldn't do it,' Allen said, adding that instead of killing her at that time, he had consensual sex with her. The alleged murder plot finally played out a couple of weeks later, when Collier-Brewer finished work and collected Brewer and their two children on the South Side of the city to take them home. On trial: Dujuan Powe, pictured, is also on trial in the murder . Her husband took the wheel while she . dozed in the front seat on their way to their West Side home but he took . a detour, going more than a mile out of his way to get gas at a . station. That's where, Powe ambushed the family, wearing a mask from the movie 'Scream,' and, wielding a gun, forced Collier-Brewer to crawl into the trunk. Allen told the jury the entire fake carjacking was caught by a surveillance camera, footage from which is likely to be shown in court as the trial continues. 'You'll see (Brewer) rearrange items in the trunk that will become her coffin,' Allen said. 'You'll see the fake carjacking go down.' The woman's body was discovered in the trunk about 24 hours later after her husband reported her missing. '(Brewer) planned it, and then did it,' Allen said, asking jurors to find both men guilty of Collier-Brewer's murder. But attorneys for both Brewer and Powe blame the other in the slaying. 'Scooter had his own plan. Scooter comes up with a mask and and gun ... and he pulls a carjacking,' defense attorney Rebecca Washtenaw said, according to DNAInfo. 'Darron puts his head in the sand.' Powe's public defender Brian Walsh told jurors that the younger brother 'was not in on the plan, did not take part in the plan.' Powe's brother 'wanted out of his relationship so bad he wanted to kill her,' Walsh told jurors.","Darron Brewer, 26, and his brother, Dujuan Powe, are on trial for the murder of 22-year-old Kenyatae Collier-Brewer .

Gabriella Amati, who was selling Compotier et Tasse, or Fruit Bowl and Cup, is facing charges of embezzling $44 million in tax paid by Naples residents. Seized: The Picasso, worth $11.5 million is being held in New York on behalf of the Italian government . Italian courts allege that the widow and her late husband Angelo Maj were involved in a scheme that set up fraudulent service contracts, forged accounting records and had inflated operational expenses, according to Yahoo. It was claimed that between 2001 and 2009, taxes paid for waste removal and other services in Naples were embezzled. At the time of the couple's arrest, along with three other people alleged to be involved with the . scheme in 2011, authorities seized valuable paintings but, according to Corriere .

Seven people were charged last night . with one count of conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation . between 2009 and 2013. The charges relate to work carried out on . victims’ homes at inflated prices. The seven month investigation is believed to be one of the biggest in England and Wales into conspiracies targeting elderly people. Sixteen people have been arrested after seven month investigation into an alleged £1million rogue trading scam . About 39 people, aged 65 and 99, are believed to have fallen victim to an organised gang and were together conned out of hundreds of thousands of pounds. A team of 65 officers were involved as suspects were arrested at addresses in the Colchester and Clacton areas yesterday. Unemployed William Brown, 48, of Colchester, and company director James Brown, 20, of Tiptree, have also been charged with one count of blackmail and one count of conspiracy to conceal criminal property. Unemployed Peter Biddle, 66, of Ardleigh; builder Van Purdy, 59, of Ardleigh; and pawnbroker Harvey White, 48, of Clacton, were all also charged with one count of conspiracy to conceal criminal property. The suspects were arrested on suspicion of . crimes including conspiracy to commit fraud, conspiracy to commit money . laundering, and suspicion of money laundering . Builder James Brown, 44, of Stanway, was also charged with one count of blackmail, one count of conspiracy to conceal criminal property and one count of fraud by false representation. All six men have been detained in police custody prior to their appearances at Colchester Magistrates’ Court later today. Nurse Rachel Poole, 47, of Bromley . Road, Ardleigh, has been released on police bail until her first court . appearance on July 16 when she will face the main charge of conspiracy . to commit fraud.

'It is through vigilant work by trading standards officers and Essex Police that means we can identify rogue trading, act upon evidence and hopefully stamp out this activity across Essex.' He added: 'Rogue doorstep can be very . convincing and it is easy to be taken in. 'We would urge people to recognise the . risk of buying services from people who call at their door and look to . recommended traders instead.'

It's difficult to imagine what a spectator at the first Wimbledon Championship in 1877 would make of the modern women's game.

While the training team had to do press-ups or a lap of the court if they let the ball drop, the 26-year-old Russian beauty avoided punishment .

If they gave out a gong for Britain’s most hard-working  and public-spirited young  man, David Day would surely be a shoo-in. For at the age of 21 – and at a time when there are more than a million youngsters not in work, college or training – Mr Day divides his time between an astonishing 11 jobs. Determined to help his community, he juggles five paid jobs with six volunteer roles, and sometimes works as many as 60 hours a week. Many guises: David Day spends five hours a week as a badminton coach (left) at Mapperley Sports Village and another hour and a half volunteering for St John Ambulance (right) His paid jobs are as a shop assistant at Primark, a steward at Notts County Football Club, a lunchtime attendant at a junior school, and two roles at after-school clubs, all of which take up 40 hours of his week. And yet he still finds time to volunteer at a youth group and a children’s play centre, coaches badminton and football, volunteers for St John Ambulance and teaches life-saving.And all for a weekly wage of up to just £262. Mr Day, from Carlton, Nottingham, said: ‘I often lose count of how many hours I do. You just don’t bother counting any more. ‘I’m just moving from one job to the next, but I’m used to the way I organise my time. ‘I would much rather be doing something useful than sitting in front of the TV.

It’s just nice to help people out. ‘I would like to see more volunteers and show people how to get involved and how good it feels to help people and see how they react.’ Mr Day’s selflessness and work ethic set an example to others, according to colleagues and local officials. George Cowcher, chief executive of Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire Chamber of Commerce, said: ‘Young people often get a bad press and there are  stereotypes that are unhelpful and can put them at a disadvantage in the eyes of potential employers. ‘But David just goes to show that there are some talented, driven and creative young people who would be an asset to any business.’ Leslie Rhodes, from Gedling Play Forum children’s group, added: ‘David puts himself out for anyone. He works as much as he can for us. ‘When a trip for disabled kids was short of a first-aider, without any notice David jumped on the bus.’ Graham Atkin, president of Mapperley Park Badminton Club, where Mr Day coaches junior sessions, said: ‘David’s a great role model for our young players.’ The number of young adults aged 16 to 24 who are not in education, employment or training has fallen by 1.3 per cent in a year to 1.09million.

Case review: Senior prosecutors have flown to Portugal to investigate fresh leads in the case of missing Madeleine McCann . Senior government lawyers have flown to Portugal to investigate fresh leads in the Madeleine McCann case, six years after she disappeared on a family holiday in the Algarve. London's chief Crown prosecutor Alison Saunders and her deputy Jenny Hopkins travelled to Portugal with Scotland Yard detectives in connection with the force's review of the case, it has been confirmed. The police review of the circumstances surrounding the little girl's disappearance has identified new 'people of interest' as well as fresh 'investigative and forensic opportunities', it has emerged. Madeleine, who was then three-years-old, vanished from her family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz on May 3 2007, as her parents Kate and Gerry dined at a nearby tapas restaurant with friends. A CPS spokesman said: 'Prosecutors . from CPS London, and investigators from the MPS (Metropolitan Police . Service), visited their Portuguese counterparts on April 17-18 to . discuss possible next steps in relation to the disappearance of . Madeleine McCann. 'We continue to work with the police on this case.' Operation Grange, conducted by Scotland Yard's Homicide & Serious Crime Command, was launched in May 2011 in response to a campaign by the McCann family. It is the first time CPS lawyers have visited Portugal in connection with the Met's review of the case. Last . month, Detective Chief Superintendent Hamish Campbell said the review . has identified 'both investigative and forensic opportunities' and had . identified 'more than a handful of people of interest'. Those 'people of interest' are understood to include Britons and known child offenders who were in the Algarve at the time of Maddie's disappearance. As . they marked the sixth anniversary of Maddie's disappearance last month, . Mr and Mrs McCann said they were encouraged by Operation Grange, and . said police seemed 'more determined than ever'. The . couple's hopes were further reinforced by the recent discovery of . Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight in Ohio, a decade after . they went missing in separate incidents.

Direct Line Group, which owns Churchill among other brands, will see around 2,000 positions slashed after the insurance giant revealed plans to more than double its original money saving target. The job cuts - representing about 14 per cent of its 14,400-strong workforce - come as Direct Line announced plans to cut costs by more than £200m by 2014. Insurer Direct Line has announced it will cut around 2,000 jobs in a new drive to more than double cost-savings . Last year the firm announced plans to save costs of up to £100m by 2014, and it has already axed 1,200 jobs since last August under the money-saving plans. Direct Line said staff across head office and support functions were expected to go in the latest round of redundancies. But the group said it hoped to redeploy staff where possible, and find opportunities for affected workers with other potential employers. It has 16 sites across the UK, including offices in central London, Croydon, Bromley, Leeds, Glasgow and Manchester. But the group is shutting its Teesside call centre over the next week, as previously announced, and it is understood another site is at risk of closure under the latest move to slash costs. Paul Geddes, chief executive of Direct Line Group, said the firm had 'not made these proposed changes lightly'. Direct Line chief executive Paul Geddes said the firm had not taken the decision to axe so many staff lightly . He added: 'As we have done in the past, we will deal fairly and carefully with those impacted, and do all we can to support them through these changes.' Direct Line, which was spun out of Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) when it floated on the stock market last year, recently revealed a £94.3m profits haul for the first three months of 2013 - up 47 per cent on a year earlier thanks to cost savings and unusually low weather-related claims. But the group, which also owns brands including Green Flag and Privilege, saw gross premiums fall 4.5 per cent during the quarter to about £1 billion as it refused to get drawn into a price war in the fiercely competitive motor insurance market. Taxpayer-backed RBS floated Direct Line to appease European Union rules on state aid.  RBS still owns 48.5% of the insurer but must sell its entire stake by the end of 2014.","The insurance group - Britain's biggest- has 16 offices around the UK .

Secondary school pupils in the UK spend less than half their time on reading, writing, literature, mathematics, science and foreign languages - one of the few countries to structure the school day like this. But in countries like France and Ireland, students spend approaching 60 per cent of their time on such key subjects. British schools do not spend enough time on core subjects like the 3Rs: reading, writing and arithmetic . Critics will say British pupils are being held back by our national curriculum which focuses on non-core subjects such as citizenship and sex and relationships education. They will argue that students should be spending more time on key subjects which could help them in the global workplace. The OECD report found that British pupils spend just 46 per cent on ‘core subjects’ - mathematics, science, modern languages and reading, writing and literature. By contrast, French pupils spend 57 per cent of their time on these subjects, while in Germany they spend 54 per cent of their time and in Ireland 56 per cent.

While Smith's new girlfriend of just over a month, Love Thai, stands by him, she made a startling admission to KOMO-TV in a recent sit-down interview about the possibility of Smith's guilt. 'You know everyone has their breakdown,' she said. 'I don't know what his threshold is, but is the possibility and the capability there? Yeah.' Murder suspect Alan Smith, 37, turned in his passport, posted bond Saturday night and got out of the Snohomish County Jail, early Sunday morning . Smith has long been a person of interest in his estranged wife's death, but he has not been charged with a crime relating to her death. Susann Smith, 37, was found murdered in her home on February 12 with defensive wounds on her hands and arms, a fractured skull, 19 separate blunt force strikes and stab wounds to her face and hands, court documents state. She had to be identified by her dental records. Alan Smith now shares that home with Love Thai. In a sit-down interview with KOMO-TV hours before he was arrested on Thursday, a barefoot Smith said he once loved Susann. Wife: Susann Smith, 37, was found murdered in her home on February 12 with defensive wounds on her hands and arms, a fractured skull, 19 separate blunt force strikes and stab wounds to her face and hands . 'She was the love of my life for a while and the mother of my children, and my heart breaks,' he said. At the time of the murder, the pair were embroiled in a bitter custody dispute over their two children who are now in state custody. ABC News reports police charged Smith with obstructing an officer Thursday in his Bothell home after they were unable to find his passport and he failed to turn it over in the murder investigation. Smith posted bond Saturday and was released from Snohomish County Jail early Sunday morning. He has now turned in his passport. Police believe he is a flight risk. In . court documents, detectives say Smith had been looking into plane . tickets to Venezuela around the time of the killing and checking Google . for phrases such as 'Will Venezuela extradite to the U.S.?' Detectives . say Smith had been purchasing 'disposable coveralls and masking tape' from Home Depot around the same time of the slaying. Lab technicians also found traces of blood on his SUV's steering wheel, center console and floor mat, and records show he had purchased disposable coveralls, shoe covers and a rubber mallet before the murder. According to search warrant documents, Mr Smith had also discussed how to kill his estranged wife with an ex-girlfriend. Police planned to take Alan Smith’s footprint and compare it to footprints found at the scene of the crime. Police have been called to the Bothell home a couple of times in the past month after complaints from neighbors.

Moors murderer Ian Brady has bragged he is as notorious as Jack the Ripper and Britain was 'obsessed' with the way he tortured, sexually abused and murdered five children. In a four-hour self serving rant yesterday, Brady said he is still famous for 'theatrical reasons' because he buried bodies on the moors, drawing comparisons to Emily Brontë's 'Wuthering Heights and all that'. The 75-year-child killer then complained to . his Manchester mental health tribunal that since he was jailed for life . in 1966 he felt like a 'monkey in a cage being poked with a stick'. 'Why are they [the public] still . talking about Jack the Ripper, after a century? Because of the dramatic . background, the fog, cobbled streets,' he said. 'Mine's the same... Wuthering Heights, Hound Of The Baskervilles.' Self-obsessed: Moors murderer Ian Brady (left yesterday and right in 1966) boasted that he was as notorious as Jack the Ripper because of his terrible crimes . Not once did he mention his poor victims, but when pressed on the five child murders he . committed with Myra Hindley, he described himself as a . ‘petty criminal’ in comparison with Tony Blair, whom he accused of . ‘minting a fortune from his war crimes’. Drama: Brady claimed the 'theatrical' elements of Jack the Ripper, like the fog and cobbled streets, meant his moors murders were just as notorious . In his soft Glaswegian accent, he described the notorious 1960s killings as ‘recreational’ and an ‘existential experience’. The notorious criminal, who wants to be sent back to prison from Ashworth secure hospital, won the right to have a mental health tribunal held in public at an estimated cost of £250,000. He wants to be judged ‘sane’ to be allowed to be transferred from secure hospital to a jail. Indeed, he yesterday said he was simply ‘method acting’ at the time he was diagnosed as mentally ill. It came as Brady’s taxpayer-funded opportunity to . present his twisted view of the world was yesterday condemned as an . ‘immoral farce’ by families of his victims. Relatives of the victims watching proceedings – relayed by video from the Merseyside hospital to a Manchester courtroom – waited in vain for any signs of remorse. One described the event as ‘the Brady Show’ while another said it was an insult to those he killed. Brady, a diagnosed narcissist, regaled the hearing with boasts about his days in a maximum security prison with the Kray twins, IRA killers and Great Train Robbers. Seizing the opportunity of being heard in public for the first time since his jailing in 1966, he delivered four hours of rambling, paranoia-filled testimony and accused the public of being obsessed with him. Not once did he mention any of those he killed. Claiming that he was the real victim, Brady – who has fought for a public hearing over the state of his mental health for a decade – complained that the public and media remained as ‘obsessed’ with his crimes as with Jack the Ripper’s. Victims: Keith Bennett, whose body has never . been recovered, left, and John Kilbride, right, were two of the . youngsters killed by Moors murderer Ian Brady during the 1960s . Lured to their deaths: Brady and his partner . Myra Hindley killed Edward Evans, left, in October 1965. Pauline Reade, . right, 16, disappeared on her . way to a disco on July 12, 1963 . ‘It fascinates them because of the . dramatic background – fog, capes, cobbled streets,’ he said. ‘The Moors . is the same thing. Wuthering Heights and all that, The Hound of the . Baskervilles ...’ He denied that talking to himself is . evidence of schizophrenia, asking ‘Who doesn’t?’ and criticised the . psychiatrists who had tried to treat him, saying: ‘They’re worse than . the patients.’ Myra Hindley, Brady's partner, who was convicted alongside him for the killings. She died in 2002, aged 60, still a prisoner . Brady said Ashworth had been ‘decent and progressive’ when he arrived in 1985 but had become a ‘penal warehouse’ by 1999 when he was forcibly moved to a ward for those with severe personality disorders – the ‘catalyst’ for his subsequent hunger strike. In a convoluted explanation of why he claims to be sane, Brady said that if he were to claim he ‘recreationally killed’, that would seem to be evidence of madness, but that if he knew precisely what he meant, ‘therefore I’m not mad’. Terry West, the older brother of Lesley Ann Downey, who was murdered at the age of ten in 1964, said: ‘This hearing is a farce and it only serves to cause more grief for the families of the victims. ‘I think it is appalling that the public should have to pay for this hearing when all it is designed to do is put him back in the public eye.’ Terry Kilbride, whose brother John, . 12, was murdered by Brady and Hindley in 1963, said the pair’s five . victims had been forgotten and the hearing was ‘a total sham’. Mr . Kilbride, 59, said it was ‘shocking and immoral’ that the money had . been spent fulfilling Brady’s demands instead of a new hunt for the . remains of 12-year-old Keith Bennett, which have never been found. Keith’s mother, Winnie Johnson, had pledged to attend the hearing to ‘look Brady in the eye’ and demand he finally divulge their whereabouts, but she died last year aged 78. Brady denied the account of nurses that he secretly supplemented force-feeding with soup and toast or that he had tried to stab one with a pen last September. He insisted he would be able to cope with the stricter regime of prison, saying that instead of reacting to provocation ‘I then pick up the pen and do the damage by writing immediately to the right people on the outside’. Brady has been incarcerated at the secure hospital since 1985 and on 'hunger strike' since 1999 . 'Why . are they still talking about Jack the Ripper after a century? Because . of the dramatic background, the fog, cobbled streets. The Moors is the . same... Wuthering Heights, Hound Of The Baskervilles . I was pretending to be insane when I arrived at Ashworth. Have you never heard of method acting? What value did I get from killing? Existential experience. Some of these psychiatrists, - I would throw a net over them. They're worse than the patients.' Pressed repeatedly on whether he would starve himself to death if allowed back to prison, he hinted that he would, saying: ‘After 50 years I’ve had enough. I’m simply saying, “Keep it, keep the rest, I’m going now”.’ He added that were his force-feeding to continue in prison, ‘I then have another plan in mind’. Brady said he had ‘no ambitions’ for the future: ‘I know that I am in until death. I have known from day one that I’m finished.’ Judge Robert Atherton, chairing the panel, opened proceedings by acknowledging relatives’ anger but insisting the tribunal’s job was to focus on Brady’s mental health, not his crimes. However he and fellow panel members pressed Brady about his murders, asking if they were not evidence of an abnormal mind. Brady said that were he an outside observer, he would ‘immediately’ say such a person was ‘mad’ and an ‘extreme danger’, but then went on to suggest politicians and soldiers committed more serious crimes. Following his evidence, Dr Kevin Gournay, a consultant psychologist called in support of Brady’s claim, told the hearing the killer had been ‘evasive in the extreme’. Brady’s legal team have argued he has severe personality disorders but is not mentally ill and could be treated in prison rather than hospital. But expert psychologists called by Ashworth say Brady is a chronically ill paranoid schizophrenic who should remain at the hospital. The hearing continues.

Medieval churches that survived the ‘ravages of the Reformation’ are under threat from a Brussels directive giving blanket protection to bats, MPs were warned yesterday. Sir Tony Baldry, who represents the Church of England in the Commons, said dozens of parish churches were facing potential closure because of the crippling cost of dealing with bat infestations. He told MPs that bat droppings were causing serious damage to medieval wall paintings, sculptures and wooden effigies - as well as posing a potential health hazard that has already forced the closure of one parish church. They're the nation's natural insecticide, says Monty Halls, but our bats need your help to survive... But under the EU Habitats Directive, bats are given sweeping protections, making it impossible for the church authorities to deal with them. Appealing to the Government to licence the destruction of bat nests, Sir Tony said: ‘Many of the churches affected by bat infestation are approaching a situation where their buildings may be unsustainable as a place of worship. ‘Now it is sometimes said that excluding bats from churches will render the bats homeless. But actually there is every chance that church congregations will find themselves homeless and without a place of worship with listed buildings left unoccupied and that is surely a solution which is undesirable for both bats and people.” He went on: ‘I cannot believe that the European Commission would want a situation in which it was not possible for congregations to worship in churches that go back to the time of the Conqueror, because of bat infestations. Citing an example in his constituency in Banbury, Oxfordshire, he added: ‘The church of St Peter ad Vincula at South Newington in my own constituency has some very fine, almost unique, medieval wall paintings which seem to have been spared Thomas Cromwell’s men. ‘But having survived the ravages of the Reformation they are now threatened by bat urine. ‘And these are irreplaceable parts of our natural heritage.’ Under the terms of the EU Habitats Directive, destroying the breeding sites or resting places of bats is a criminal offence carrying a maximum sentence of six months in prison. Under threat: Sir Tony said the church of St Peter and Vincula in South Newington is being damaged by bats . The situation has left many churches facing huge cleaning and repair bills, and even forced them to take additional measures to accommodate their unwanted guests. For example, the small parish church of Wiggenhall, St Germans, was forced to fit a ‘bat flap’ when replacing a small broken window pane, pushing up the cost from £5 to £140. Environment Minister Richard Benyon acknowledged that churches faced serious problems from bats, but warned that issuing licences would lead to lengthy and costly legal challenges. Environment minister Richard Benyon . He suggested that concerned congregations should contact the ‘National Bat Helpline’ for advice on minimising the damage caused by bat colonies. The Government is focusing on making sure that guidance issued by the helpline and by conservation body Natural England is ‘clear, proportionate and unambiguous’. The Government is also funding research looking into bat deterrents and alternative roosting sites such as bat boxes. Mr Benyon said so far acoustic devices are providing the best hope and further trials will be rolled out this year to prove that bats will not get used to them. He said: ‘Since this has been brought to my attention, it’s rather changed the way I look at churches, and occasionally my mind strays from the sermon now and I look up to see the impact bats may be having in my own church and elsewhere.” Mr Benyon went on: ‘Like you, I simply do not believe that it was the intention of those who drafted the Habitats Directive to render places of worship unusable to congregations or to impose unreasonable financial burdens to those congregations.’ A European Commission spokesman last night insisted that the British government had the power to vary the rules in cases where bats were causing damage. The spokesman said: ‘Member states can derogate from the strict protection based on Article 16 of the Habitats Directive. One reason for doing this would be to prevent serious damage to property. ‘The Commission is therefore convinced that it is possible to protect both bats and churches.’","Infestations making many churches 'unsustainable for worship'

A divided Supreme Court said Tuesday that federal law doesn't require that a Native American child be taken away from her adoptive parents and given to her biological father, meaning that the girl will be moved once more. The girl was put up for adoption by her mother and was raised by a South Carolina family for more than two years before the state's courts cited an old law- intended to protect Native American families- and forced the girl to be put in the care of her biological father, who has Native American ancestry. South Carolina courts said the 1978 Indian Child Welfare Act favored the biological father of the girl, named Veronica. But the South Carolina couple who raised her for the first 27 months of her life appealed that decision. Happy family: Matt and Melanie Capobianco were in the delivery room when Veronica was born in Oklahoma in September 2009 . Justice Samuel Alito, writing for the court's majority, said the federal law didn't apply in this case because the biological father never had custody of the child and abandoned her before birth. Alito also said the law doesn't stop non-Native Americans from adopting the child when no other eligible candidates stepped forward. The law 'doesn't apply in cases where the Indian parent never had custody of the Indian child,' said Alito, who was joined in his opinion by Chief Justice John Roberts, and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Stephen Breyer. 'The Act would put certain vulnerable children at a great disadvantage solely because an ancestor – even a remote one – was an Indian,' Alito said. 'A biological Indian father could abandon his child in utero and refuse any support for the birth mother – perhaps contributing to the mother's decision to put the child up for adoption – and then could play his ICWA trump card at the eleventh hour to override the mother's decision and the child's best interest. 'I'm always going to be her daddy': Dusten Brown and daughter Veronica met for the first time on New Year's Eve 2011 . ‘If this were possible, many prospective adoptive parents would surely pause before adopting any child who might possibly qualify as an Indian under the ICWA.' The court's 5-4 decision sends the case back to the South Carolina courts. But Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented and pointed out that the court's ruling doesn't mean the baby, whose is only known publicly as Veronica, will now go back to her adoptive parents. September 2009: Baby Veronica is born in Oklahoma, with the Capobiancos present at the birth . January 2010: Dustin Brown signs away his custody rights but days later files an appeal . December 2011: Veronica is handed over to her biological father after a family court in South Carolina grants him custody . July 2012: South Carolina Supreme Court upholds the custody decision . April 2013: U.S. Supreme Court hears an appeal from the Capobiancos . July 2013: Court sides 5-4 with the adoptive family . 'The majority does not and cannot foreclose the possibility that on remand, Baby Girl's paternal grandparents or other members of the Cherokee Nation may formally petition for adoption of Baby Girl,' she said. 'If these parties do so, and if on remand, Birth Father's parental rights are terminated so that an adoption becomes possible, they will then be entitled to consideration under the order of preference established in' federal law. Her dissent was joined by Justices Antonin Scalia, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan. Sotomayor said the court's decision turns the law 'upside down, reading it from bottom to top in order to reach a conclusion that is manifestly contrary to Congress' express purpose in enacting ICWA: preserving the familial bonds between Indian parents and their children and, more broadly, Indian tribes' relationships with the future citizens who are `vital to (their) continued existence and integrity.' Added Scalia in a separate dissent: 'This father wants to raise his daughter, and the statute amply protects his right to do so. There is no reason in law or policy to dilute that protection.' The Obama administration, 18 states, several Indian tribes, current and former members of Congress and children's welfare groups filed briefs in support of the father. The future of Veronica Brown is being discussed at the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday . The National Council for Adoption and the American Association of Adoption Attorneys were among the groups that filed briefs in support of the South Carolina couple. Dusten Brown, a member of the Cherokee Nation, invoked the federal law to stop the adoption arranged by the girl's non-Indian mother when she was pregnant and the Charleston, South Carolina-area couple, Matt and Melanie Capobianco. The couple was present at Veronica's birth in Oklahoma. Brown had never met his daughter and, after the mother rebuffed his marriage proposal, played no role during the pregnancy and paid no child support after Veronica was born. But when Brown found out Veronica was going to be adopted, he objected and said the law favored the girl living with him and growing up learning tribal traditions. South Carolina courts agreed and Brown took Veronica, now 3, back to Oklahoma at the end of 2011, even though she had lived with the Capobiancos for the first 27 months of her life. Jefferson Keel, president of the National Congress of American Indians, said the court's decision leaves the ICWA in place, which he called 'the most important law to protect Native children and families.' Busy week: The Supreme Court has been handing down a number of important decisions this week . 'While we are pleased the court has upheld ICWA, we're very disappointed for Dusten, Veronica, and the Brown family that the court has ruled to send the case back to the South Carolina courts on a technicality,' Keel said. 'However, the courts in South Carolina have previously affirmed that Dusten Brown is Veronica's father and that he is a fit parent. We are confident that his parental rights will be upheld, and that Veronica will stay with her family.' Sotomayor said 'the anguish this case has caused will only be compounded' by the court's ruling if another change is made in the girl's living arrangements. 'Baby Girl has now resided with her father for 18 months,' she said. 'However difficult it must have been for her to leave Adoptive Couple's home when she was just over 2 years old, it will be equally devastating now, if at the age of three and a half, she is again removed from her home and sent to live halfway across the country.'","Biological father Dusten Brown was able to gain custody of his daughter after invoking Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 .

Allan Debenham, 39, claimed to be the TV presenter and interviewer - . and even provided a fake contact from the BBC’s finance department as . proof. He used the bogus identity to blag a £70-a-night room at the Duke of York pub at Shepton Beauchamp, near Ilminster,  and gave . hotel staff an order number so they could claim payment back from the . Beeb. During his three-night stay he also pretended to be Mr . Theroux’s personal assistant and ordered two bottles of wine from room . service to add to the tab. He was only rumbled when staff became . suspicious when the ‘PA’ telephoned again and asked for for 'some fags' to be taken to Debenham’s room. Debenham, of Taunton, Somerset, was today given a 12 month supervised community order at South . Somerset Magistrates Court. He pleaded guilty to two charges of . making a false representation at a previous hearing - and to a charge of . assault by beating following an attack on his girlfriend. Chris Ivory, defending, told the court: 'Having lost his home and having no money he was desperate. 'In . desperation he told a hotel establishment and taxi driver that he was . somebody he was not in an aim of getting shelter for the evening and not . to spend another night under the stars. 'He did state that he was very sorry and that, if he had money, he would pay the bill for the hotel and taxi driver. 'He can only express his remorse to Mr Theroux for any embarrassment he has caused. 'None of these offences were carried out with any malicious intent.' Debenham . had been made homeless after splitting with his fiance who he assaulted . by grabbing her arm and pushing her back into a wardrobe. He then . spent a string of nights 'under the stars' and booked a room at the Duke . of York as Louis Theroux, on April 21 . this year. At an earlier hearing Emma Chetland, prosecuting, said: 'Later the pub receives another telephone call purporting to be from . Louis Theroux’s PA who gives a telephone number for the BBC’s finance . department and an order number to arrange payment. 'He also asks for . two bottles of wine to be left outside the room. The PA rings again and . asks for two bottles of cava and some fags - to use his words - to be . left outside the same room. 'The person taking the call becomes . suspicious at the use of the word ""fags"" rather than cigarettes. They go . upstairs and find the door to the room locked. Impression: Debenham pretended to be journalist Louis Theroux, pictured, and asked for the hotel bill to be sent to the BBC . 'They call the . telephone number that was left and find it to be unobtainable and they . call the BBC who tell them the order number is not one they recognise.' Pub . staff called police and Debenham was arrested and investigations . revealed that the he had also booked a taxi costing £14.50 to take him . to a pub.

He had also been found guilty of assault by beating following the attack on his girlfriend at a previous trial. Amanda Campbell, chairwoman of the bench, told him the assault was the most serious charge.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 01:09 EST, 26 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:10 EST, 26 June 2013 . It may look harmless but the tiny bark beetle, roughly the size of a grain of rice, has been blamed for causing mass devastation in the Colorado wildfires. The winged pine beetles have killed off millions of acres of woodland, creating wide stretches of tinder-dry dead trees to feed the fires. More than 75,000 acres have already been scorched in southwest Colorado, forcing 600 people to be moved from their homes in what is considered the worst fire to have hit Rio Grande National Forest. Tiny danger: Bark beetles, such as the red turpentine, kill off pine trees and create ideal wildfire conditions . Despite about 900 firefighters trying to halt the fire, it is unlikely that it will be contained until there is rain and a drop in temperature. Scientists say that mild winters are partly to blame for the infestation of beetles, and the subsequent wildfires. 'The culprit here is the unusual weather . conditions, which might become the new norm with climate change,' Jesse Logan, a retired U.S. Forest Service researcher, told NBC News. After months of drought and a mild winter, the temperature has not dropped enough to kill off the insects, which has created conditions favorable to beetles and wildfires. The wildfires and beetle . outbreak are considered to be an effect of climate change. A similar link between the two was made in 1988, when more than a million acres around Yellowstone National Park caught fire. 'Independent of what the beetle had done in certain areas of Yellowstone, the whole thing went up in flames,' Mr Logan said. 'You can point your finger in various directions. It might be the mountain pine beetles, or it might be lack of response to a lightning strike. But really what was driving that was unusually dry weather conditions, and that's what's happening in Colorado.' The beetles, which are about 3mm to 8mm long, can be found from New Mexico to Canada. They like to feast on lodgepole pines, which they burrow into. Devastation: About 900 firefighters are working to contain the wildfires that are sweeping through Colorado . Once inside, the beetles eat the inner bark and lay eggs, creating an infestation that eventually kills the tree. Since 1996 the beetles have attacked almost 3.4 million acres in Colorado, and 3.7 million acres in Wyoming and South Dakota. Scientists are still debating how beetle damage increases the risk of wildfires. If a tree killed by the beetles loses its flammable pine needles, or falls, which creates distance between the trees, the risk of fire is reduced. 'There could be cases where a bad beetle outbreak could have a big effect, or there could be cases where it would have little effect or almost no effect,' Chad Hoffman, a professor of fire science at Colorado State University, said. A co-author of a Natural Areas Journal paper that examined the impact of bark beetles, has also said that drought rather than beetle damage was the main cause of wildfire. 'It’s natural enough to look at a landscape that is covered with trees recently killed by bark beetles and, therefore, worry about fire risk,' Dominik Kulakowski, assistant professor of geography and biology at Clark University in Massachusetts, told the Seattle Times. 'But if you look into the long-term ecology of these forests, there is a high fire risk under drought conditions, even when the trees are green and the landscape looks beautiful.” Tell tale signs: A forest ranger points out evidence of bark beetle damage in a pine tree . Forest officials have been trying to halt the progress of the beetles by removing infected trees, spraying pesticides or felling mature lodgepole pines which are favored by the beetles. Killing the beetles off entirely is not an option however. By killing off the pines, which then catch fire, seeds are released from lodgepole pinecones. 'There's a school of thought that says without the mountain pine beetles, we wouldn't have lodgepole pines,' Allan Carroll, a forest ecologist at the University of British Columbia, said.","More than 75,000 acres destroyed in worst fire to hit Rio Grande forest .

Lord Justice Leveson is facing a standoff with MPs after being summoned to give evidence to a Commons committee on the future of Press regulation. The judge, who led last year’s inquiry into media standards, was yesterday called to appear before the culture, media and sport committee. He refused to answer questions on the day his report was published and is understood to have indicated that he has no desire to appear before MPs, arguing that judges do not have to explain themselves to Parliament. Lord Justice Leveson (left) has been called to appear in before the culture, media and sport committee. Committee chair John Whittingdale said MPs want to hear Leveson's view of the proposed Royal Charters . Discussions between Parliament and the Lord Chief Justice, which started some months ago, are thought to have ended in stalemate. But yesterday members of the committee agreed at a private meeting to ask Lord Justice Leveson to appear before them. They want him to face questions – expected to include the issue of why wider evidence of phone hacking and surveillance by law and insurance firms was not highlighted in his report – before the Commons begins its summer break on July 18. John Whittingdale, the committee’s chairman, said: ‘We would like to hear his views on the developments that have taken place since the publication of the report. We would like to hear his view of what is on the table. ‘He chaired an inquiry which made recommendations to Parliament – it doesn’t seem unreasonable that Parliament ask him some questions about that. If he were a sitting judge delivering a verdict on a case, that would be different. That wasn’t the case in this instance.’ If he agrees to appear, Lord Justice Leveson will be questioned on the two rival versions of a Royal Charter that would underpin a new media regulator – one produced after cross-party talks, and the other by the newspaper industry. MPs want to question him on two rival versions of a Royal Charter that would underpin a new media regulator . Lord Justice Leveson is also likely to be questioned about the affair between Carine Patry Hoskins, a lawyer to his inquiry, and David Sherborne, a barrister representing celebrities complaining about the Press . Both are being considered by the Privy Council, an advisory body to the Queen which issues such charters. Lord Justice Leveson is also likely to be questioned about the revelation that a lawyer to his inquiry had an affair with a barrister representing celebrities complaining about the Press. Carine Patry Hoskins, a married mother of two, started a relationship with David Sherborne, a barrister representing advocates of statutory Press regulation. The invitation to Lord Justice Leveson is believed to be the first time a judge has been publicly summoned to a Commons select committee. However Lord Hutton, who led  an inquiry into the death of government scientist Dr David Kelly, gave evidence to the public administration select committee after he had retired as a judge. Appearances by judges before MPs are usually choreographed, with  questioning limited to matters that  do not draw judges into individual cases, criticism of public figures or political controversy. The rules that govern judicial select committee appearances state that  it is ‘extremely unusual and very unlikely to be the case that a parliamentary committee will order a judge to attend’. Asked whether the judge should appear before the committee, David Cameron’s official spokesman said: ‘It is a matter for him.’ A spokesman for the judiciary said: ‘Lord Justice Leveson has not received any communication from the committee. He will respond if and when he does.’","MPs want to question Lord Justice Leveson on rival Royal Charters .

The widow of a man James 'Whitey' Bulger is accused of luring to his death told the court today of the moment she bravely confronted the gangster about her husband's disappearance 38 years ago. Margaret King, 68, said she courageously marched up to Bulger as he was getting into his car outside Triple O's bar in South Boston demanding to know where her husband Tommy King was. Margaret King, the widow of Tommy King, pictured, told the court she confronted James 'Whitey' Bulger's disappearance 38 years ago . 'I wanted more information,' King said of the day in November 1975 she stormed the Winter Hill . hangout. 'I'm sure he was agitated that I would . bother him,' She said remembered a snarling Bulger saying to her: 'He's probably in Canada robbing banks, because that's what he originally wanted to do.' Boston police had knocked on her door on November 6 looking for her husband of eight years, according to the Boston Herald. They told her the body of Francis 'Buddy' Leonard, his friend, had been found in his car and they wanted to search the house. King, a post partum nurse, testified her husband and Leonard had 'grown up together' and she knew of no reason for Tommy King to kill him. Tommy King's bones were unearthed near the Neponset River in Dorchester in 2000. His widow said he was identified through his brother’s DNA and that she has always believed Bulger murdered her husband, an associate of the mobster. Prosecutors today said that Bulger had killed King by luring him into a car where he was shot by hitman John Martorano. Sinister: James 'Whitey' Bulger, left, is accused of ordering hitman John Martorano, right, to kill associate Tommy King in 1975 . Martorano testified last week that he had shot and killed King because Bulger had ordered it. 'Him and Tommy couldn't get along. They were always butting heads together,' Martorano told the court. 'He wanted to get rid of Tommy.' To . get rid of Tommy King, the Winter Hill Gang asked him to accompany them on a drive-by hit, . Martorano testified, according to ABC News. Mobsters in the car handed King, who they convinced to get into the passenger seat of the car, an unloaded gun before Martorano shot him in the head. Bulger, 83, is on trial for a string of crimes, including 19 murders, extortion, money laundering and gun stockpiling. He was arrested two years ago after 16 years on the run. He has pleaded not guilty. The trial so far has featured former mobsters, retired law enforcement members and family members of alleged Bulger victims, including Francis 'Buddy' Leonard's brother Joseph.

A crying Castucci described for the court a photo of her late husband with Frank Sinatra taken when they attended the wedding of Sammy Davis Jr. Castucci received about $2 million after suing the federal government, blaming the FBI’s mishandling of Bulger as an informant for her husband's death, according to the Boston Herald.

A lost bravery medal awarded to a homing pigeon that was the first to bring news of the D-Day landings back to Britain has been discovered after 69 years. The Dickin Medal - the animal version of the Victoria Cross - was won by a bird called the Duke of Normandy that was dropped behind enemy lines with Allied paratroopers hours before the invasion. The men were to capture bridges at the eastern end of the Normandy bridgehead and head towards the beaches to link up with the main invasion force. The Dickin Medal was won by a bird called the Duke of Normandy that was dropped behind enemy lines with Allied paratroopers hours before the invasion . Cooped up in a small cage, the grand cock breed was released by a paratrooper at 6am on June 6, 1944, with a message attached to it relating to the success of the drop. As was normal with World War Two carrier pigeons, ‘The Duke’ flew back to its owner’s loft who then contacted the War Office. In spite of strong winds and being shot at by German riflemen, the bird arrived in one piece 26 hours later, bringing vital news of the momentous operation. The Duke was one of 32 pigeons to be awarded the Dickin Medal for their heroics in the war. It was thought his gong had been lost over the course of time but it turned up in a box of old badges bought by a collector 25 years ago. Even then, the unnamed owner had no . idea what it was until several Dickin Medals were featured on an episode . of the BBC’s Antiques Roadshow last month. He dug it out and has made it available for sale at auction, with a pre-sale estimate of 10,000 pounds. Steven Bosley, of Bosley’s . auctioneers of Marlow, Bucks, said: “As radio silence was of utmost . importance during the paratrooper part of D-Day, the role of racing . pigeons became crucial. the medal (pictured left and right) is like the Victoria Cross for animals . “Many of them were kept in small cages and were dropped with the Allied paratroopers of the 21st Army Group but The Duke was the first to arrive back with news. “Once the paratroopers could ascertain the success of the operation, they released at 6am with a message. “Inspite of bombs and bullets, northerthly gales in the Channel and heavy rain, he returned to his loft in 26 hours and 50 minutes. “The information he brought back was crucial to the War Office in London.” During World War Two, the Allied Pigeon Service was set up and involved over 200,000 birds being given to the armed services. Those that flew over Nazi-occupied Europe were part of the Special Pigeon Service. In 1943 Maria Dickin, founder of the . People’s Dispensary of Sick Animals (PDSA) set up the Dickin Medal to . honour the bravery of animals in the war. The citation for The Duke’s states: . “For being the first bird to arrive with a message from paratroopers of . the 21st Army Group behind enemy lines on D-Day.” The Duke of Normandy was the first to deliver news of the D-Day landings back home . Commando troops landing from landing craft on Normandy beaches, during the D-Day landings, June 6, 1944 . Mr Bosley said: “A private individual from Kidderminster bought the medal by chance 25 years ago when he bought a box full of military badges. “He didn’t know anything about it until he saw one featured on TV recently. “Dickin Medals awarded to pigeons are rare because there are only so many of them so they do command good prices.” The Royal Pigeon Racing Association owns five of of these medals. Stewart Wardrope, general manager of the associatin, said: “The Germans had special teams called Hawk units based along the coast which were snipers and their job was to try and shot England-bound pigeons out of the sky. “All the pigeons were interested in was getting home but they regularly had to fly through shot and fire to do that. “They returned to their owners who then made contact with the military and passed on the coded messages.” The auction takes place on July 3.","The Dickin Medal was won by a bird that .

Hounded out: Magistrate Yvonne Davies told defendant Christopher Duncan who she was sentencing for growing cannabis that addiction to the drug had led to the death of her own brother . A campaigner for the legalisation of cannabis has boasted of his role in forcing a magistrate to resign. Peter Reynolds made one of four official complaints about Yvonne Davies, who had highlighted the dangers of the drug when sentencing a dealer. Judicial officials upheld the complaints – a decision that eventually cost the 65-year-old great grandmother her job on the bench. Cannabis claimed the life of her brother at just 39. But Mr Reynolds, who has smoked cannabis since turning 14, claimed the magistrate had been scaremongering and the drug was safer than peanuts. ‘She was spreading scare stories about cannabis which are wholly unacceptable,’ he said. ‘There are only small risks with cannabis – it is nowhere near as bad as alcohol. ‘She made the right decision to resign and she has been brought to her senses because she was in an impossible position – she could not dispense justice fairly with such strong views against cannabis.’ Mrs Davies had issued a heartfelt plea to a cannabis grower to mend his ways, describing the devastating case of her brother. She said she had told of her family’s ordeal ‘hundreds of times’ during her 14 years on the bench. However, she was officially reprimanded by the Office for Judicial Complaints and said she felt her position became untenable following a ‘back-to-work’ interview in which she was repeatedly asked to resign by senior colleagues. Mr Reynolds, a divorced former advertising executive, has even encouraged his own children, now 26 and 24, to use cannabis. In his letter of complaint, he wrote: ‘It is clear that you [Mrs Davies] have suffered a family tragedy and it is possible your brother was one of the tiny minority of people who react badly to cannabis. ‘However, the scientific evidence is that cannabis is very, very safe – much safer than alcohol, tobacco, all prescription drugs, most over-the-counter medicines and even peanuts.’ Drugs lobbyist: Peter Reynolds has claimed that cannabis is 'as safe as peanuts' In the letter, which went to the OJC, the 55-year-old told Mrs Davies to come to ‘her senses’ and stop being ‘biased’. He wrote: ‘Your conduct in expressing your opinions which diverge so clearly from the facts and evidence is irresponsible, dangerous and entirely unforgiveable. Please issue a public apology and resign.’ Mr Reynolds, who became leader of the pro-cannabis group Clear in 2011, has repeatedly lobbied for users to be able to buy the drug in licensed premises. ‘The harmful aspects of cannabis are . vastly exaggerated, especially by people like Mrs Davies, and it is only . right that we should put these people right.' Peter Reynolds . He says he has ‘always been outraged by the law interfering in his life’ and claims legalisation would cut crime. He said: ‘The harmful aspects of cannabis are vastly exaggerated, especially by people like Mrs Davies, and it is only right that we should put these people right. ‘Cannabis can have many benefits and advocating regulation of it will get rid of the criminals who run the markets at the moment.’ Mr Reynolds, who lives in Weymouth, Dorset, has also encouraged his elderly father to use the drug. The 80-year-old arthritis sufferer rejected his son’s advice because he ‘didn’t want to break the law’. Last August Mrs Davies, who is a psychotherapist and mental health counsellor, spoke out about her family tragedy while sentencing Christopher Duncan, 55, to 200 hours of unpaid work for growing cannabis. She said her family went through a ‘living hell’ after her brother Glen Harding died. He developed epilepsy, schizophrenia and depression following years of smoking cannabis and was found dead in a canal in 1997. Experience: The 65-year-old chairman of the bench had cited the 'living hell' her family went through after losing her brother Glen Harding, pictured . Following the hearing – and Mrs Davies’s interviews in local and national media – the OJC launched an investigation into the way she had expressed her personal views on the case. This was triggered by four complaints including three from retired magistrates – former bench chairman Roger Hall and his two former deputies Barbara Holmes and Pauline Holt. The retired magistrates used Mr Reynolds’s pro-cannabis arguments when they stated their case against Mrs Davies. All the complainants asked for Mrs Davies to be removed from her position immediately. She was suspended but, following a ten-month investigation, the OJC opted only to reprimand her. The decision was signed off by the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Chief Justice. Tragic: Glen Harding developed schizophrenia and epilepsy, apparently as a result of cannabis use. He is pictured here with his father Les Harding in 1987 . She stood down on Friday after being asked to resign by a justice clerk and a liaison judge. She  said she felt ‘disgusted and let down’ by the system and had been ‘pilloried’ for speaking out. ‘It is also doubly astounding that the views of a pro-cannabis campaigner were used to build a case against me. As far as I am aware, cannabis is still very much illegal in Britain,’ she added. Mrs Davies, who lives with her husband Ernie, 65, in Partington, Greater Manchester, said she  ensured justice had prevailed in all her cases. ‘But I still do not regret speaking out because I felt I was doing the right thing and helping people to stay away from a harmful substance,’ she said. ‘But I don’t regret any of it and I would speak out again about the dangers of using drugs. My brother lost his life because of it and if I can save others from the devastation it causes I will.","Peter Reynolds was one of four to complain about JP Yvonne Davies .

Mrs Hanspaul also revealed that his . devastated wife Emily, 32, had filed for a divorce and has not  spoken . to their family since he fled to France with the schoolgirl last . September. Forrest was jailed for . five-and-a-half years on Friday after a jury heard how he started . grooming his ‘vulnerable and infatuated’ victim when she was just 14 to . satisfy his ‘carnal lust’. Caught on camera: Forrest and the girl aboard a ferry from Dover to Calais last September, and she clearly still has feelings for him despite his abduction conviction . Mugshot: Jeremy Forrest was told by the judge that he had broken the cardinal rule of teaching when he had an affair with a young pupil . He first kissed her in his classroom at Bishop Bell Church of  England School in Eastbourne, East Sussex. When she turned 15, they swapped . topless photos by text and he seduced her at secret meetings in his . marital home, his car and budget hotels. The girl told a friend that the pair . would have sex up to eight times a night. But after police were tipped . off last September, they fled to France on a ferry. They were caught eight days later in . Bordeaux. Before the trial the schoolgirl wrote an emotional letter to . his parents vowing to wait for him and said that she was focusing on . building a future for them both. The pair mouthed ‘I love you’ to each . other as he was found guilty and he later told his parents that he . planned to marry the teenager, who recently turned 16, after his . release. Mrs Hanspaul told ITV’s Daybreak programme that if the pair did marry his family would attend the wedding. Same age as his victim: The Forrest family on holiday in La Rochelle, France, with Jeremy in the middle aged 16, posing with his siblings Carrie and Tom . Celebrations: Jeremy and younger brother Tom give Carrie a kiss on her wedding day in 2005 . ‘Obviously, if they have managed to . survive all of this, and he stays in there all that time, she will be . 21, he will be 35, that then would become, if you like, a normal . relationship. Obviously, we would support them, if that’s what they . chose to do,’ she said. But she said that did not mean the . family approved of his actions and they had all ‘told him off’. ‘But . being angry at him isn’t going to help him,’ Mrs Hanspaul added .

Elaine Joyner, 53, of Deptford, south-east London, is charged with administering a poison or noxious substance so as to endanger life - but Judge Andrew Lees ruled today that she was unfit to plead. Scene: The 11-month-old boy drank some of the liquid and vomited after being handed the bottle in a branch of McDonald's (pictured) in Eltham, south-east London, Woolwich Crown Court was told . A trial to decide whether Joyner carried out the act went ahead in her absence. Peter Clark, prosecuting, told the jury that the incident took place last September at the McDonald’s branch. He said: ‘Elaine Joyner, say the prosecution, gave to a complete stranger’s baby a feeding bottle that contained a poisonous or noxious substance, a fluid that contained bleach, or something very similar. ‘The baby, who was 11 and a half months old, took some of that fluid in his mouth and was immediately rendered ill by it. He retched and vomited over himself and turned very pale.’ His grandmother seized it from the pram to prevent further harm, Mr Clark said. The baby - who cannot be identified for legal reasons - made a good recovery with no long-term ill effects, he added. ‘Ingestion of bleach can prove fatal, and in the case of such a young child is particularly hazardous.’ Mr Clark said there was good quality CCTV . from McDonald’s, which did not show the precise handing of the bottle, . which was just out of shot, but one could see the frame of the pram. ‘You see someone passing a bottle, and you can be sure it’s Elaine Joyner,’ he told the jury.

In such circumstances, there would not be a finding of guilty or not guilty, but the jury should decide whether she did the act she was alleged to have done. Trainee Detective Constable Sandra Voak - formerly a uniformed Police Constable - told the court she had identified Joyner from a CCTV photograph from that day last September as someone she had dealings with in 2011. She said she spent an hour with her in July that year, including 15 minutes sitting next to her in a car. Asked by Stella Harris, defending, if she was sure that the person she had seen in the CCTV image was the same woman she had dealings with in 2011, she said: ‘I am absolutely certain that is the same person.’ The trial was adjourned to tomorrow.

But yesterday there were still rows of empty seats on the major courts at Wimbledon – to the fury of those who had failed to get in. Unoccupied seats were clearly visible at Centre Court as Serena Williams and David Ferrer played. And as millions of Britons were glued to their television sets to watch Heather Watson’s fortunes, Court Two – where she lost to American teenager Madison Keys – appeared to be only half full. The situation was better on Court One where Laura Robson was playing, but many seats still went unfilled. This was despite many of the tickets for yesterday’s show courts being allocated more than a day before the gates  actually opened. Room to spare: Row upon row of empty seats at Court No1 for the Robson match yesterday . Tennis fans watching at home took to Twitter to voice their frustration at the abundance of vacant seats . The empty seats led to a fierce Twitter row, with many blaming it on corporate hospitality clients failing to show up. Sports presenter Gary Lineker wrote: ‘Lot of empty seats on centre court. Corporate lethargy, no doubt. What a waste of tickets so many would give their right arm for #wimbledon.’ The All England Club denied that the seats belonged to businesses and sponsors, saying that they were empty because spectators had gone to buy food.

And there were no hospitality seats on Court Two.’ The spokesman added that the hospitality suites knew in advance who was not able to attend, and were able to re-sell their tickets. Last summer, thousands of seats at the London Olympics remained empty, much to the anger of those who had tried but failed to buy one.","Fans desperate for tickets furious at vacant seats in Centre Court .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 13:18 EST, 25 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:12 EST, 25 June 2013 . Scientists are still reviewing their findings but one thing is clear: there was a tsunami wave in New Jersey on June 13. An unlikely occurrence on the country’s east coast, the wave was observed by several people at Barnegat Light State Park in Ocean County. And three men were even sucked into the water. Scroll down for video... Tsunami: Scientists say a wave like a tsunami struck this South Jersey inlet at Barnegat Light State Park June 13 and witnesses, three of whom were sucked into the water, corroborate the evidence . It happened during the afternoon, just after a weather system known as a low-end derecho. The storm, a much stronger version of which took out power and caused destruction over a swath of the Midwest and East Coast last summer, had come to an end before the waves were detected by more than 30 tide gauges in the northwest Atlantic. At around 3:30pm, Brian Coen was spearfishing near Barnegat Inlet. The sky was grey, but the weather had calmed and the tide was on its way out. Coen said that’s when the water began to rush out of the inlet unusually fast. Rocks that what been submerged were suddenly revealed in the over one minute gush. Rare: Quite unusual for the East Coast, the 6-foot gush occurred at this South Jersey inlet at Barnegat Light State Park . Derecho: NOAA scientists say the culprit, at least partially, could be the low-end derecho that swept across the eastern half of the country June 13 . Wall of water: Brian Coen was spear fishing when he first saw water gush out of the inlet and then surge back in and described a 'wall of water' with six-foot waves . Meanwhile, Coen’s friends, who were diving below him, ‘drifted literally like a hundred yards in like 30 seconds’ he told WCAU. Brian Coen then saw a 6-foot wave replace the receding waters, despite the outgoing tide. ‘There was whitewater across the whole mouth of the inlet,’ he said. Three people were swept off the rocks of the nearby jetty by the wave and two required subsequent medical attention. Weather induced? A satellite image shows the derecho as it approached the east coast June 13. Researchers called the causes of the wave ¿complex¿ and ¿still under review¿ . ‘It had a different kind of energy,’ Coen said. ‘More like a surge than an actual wave.’ Chuck Ebersole, steward at Wickford Yacht Club in North Kingstown, Rhode Island, said he saw a strong current of about 7 knots, or 8 miles per hour, going out through a channel into Narragansett Bay. Normally, he said, the current is 1 to 2 miles per hour. The current was so strong that one large boat pulled its cleat out of the dock, he said. After a while, the current reversed at the same speed, he said. A nearby gauge recorded that the sea level changed by 1.3 feet. Various factors are being analyzed, . including the possibility that slumping at the Continental Shelf of New . Jersey played a role. ‘From North Carolina up through Massachusetts, we can find . that signal, even though it's very small, which tells us there was something . going on,’ Mike Angove, head of NOAA's tsunami program, said Tuesday. ‘We're . trying to piece this back together.’ Dangerous: Three men were swept from this New Jersey jetty by the 6-foot surge and two required medical attention . Angove stopped short of saying it was a . tsunami, but acknowledged it had specific characteristics of one. NOAA's . West Coast/Alaska Tsunami Warning Center posted a statement calling it a . tsunami. Angove said it is a specific feature of tsunamis for water to be drawn out to sea and then rapidly rush back in, and the water speeds Ebersole reported in Rhode Island indicated something other than a storm surge. He said researchers are looking for a cause. One possibility is a rare meteotsunami, which is a tsunami caused by weather. Or it could have been caused by a landslide off the continental shelf, which is less rare but still uncommon, he said. 'If we can't do that, it's going to be tough to put this egg back together,' he said.","A 6-foot swell swept three people into the water in rare East Coast occurrence .

Canadian Mark Carney said businesses should prepare for possibility of a 'slight or material change' in interest rate levels . Britain's record low interest base rate could be on the way out after more than four years at 0.5 per cent, the new governor  of the Bank of England warned yesterday. The introduction of a higher rate would be a blow to homeowners and firms used to cheap borrowing. Canadian Mark Carney, who takes over from Sir Mervyn King on Monday, told ITV News a rise was on the cards, adding: ‘Without doubt they need to manage their business for the possibility of a slight or material change in the level of interest rates.’ Households that are heavily in debt could struggle with increased mortgage repayments and other loans if the Bank puts rates up, although savers would be delighted. Sir Mervyn, who retires after ten years as governor, told MPs on the Treasury Select Committee: ‘It is clearly the case that with the prospect at some point down the road of higher interest rates it is not sensible to be in a highly indebted position.’ He said some in their thirties and forties had unmanageably large mortgages and would struggle if interest rates rose. Sir Mervyn used his final public appearance to warn that they had not taken advantage of low borrowing levels to pay off mortgages, instead amassing dangerous levels of debt. He said the baby-boom generation had benefited from a steady rise in house prices, but this had forced their children to borrow beyond their means to get on the property ladder. Sir Mervyn added that this meant those in their thirties and forties would be left in an ‘unsustainable’ position if interest rates hit 3 or 4 per cent. He told the Commons Treasury Select Committee: ‘The idea we are about to return to normal levels of interest rates is premature. One of the reasons we are not about to return is because so many households have such a high level of household debt. ‘If there are changes around the world that lead interest rates to go up, then some of those households will have debt that won’t look so attractive given the new level of house prices.’ But he said rate increases were a long way off, and only after the economy recovered. Deputy governor Charlie Bean suggested rates could actually be cut to minus figures to stimulate growth. ‘There is nothing special about going into negative territory,’ he said. ‘A reduction in Bank rate, including to below zero, remains an option.’ However, Simon Rose, of the  campaign group Save Our Savers, said: ‘Artificially low interest rates have not produced growth but still these idiotic central bankers want them lower, perhaps even into negative territory.’ The Bank slashed interest rates to a record low of 0.5 per cent in March 2009 and has since pumped £375billion of emergency funds into the economy to stop recession turning into depression. If the Bank of England increases rates it would be blow to homeowners and firms used to cheap borrowing . Officials at the Bank and the Treasury believe Britain is finally on the road to recovery more than five years after the financial crisis struck. But the outgoing governor added: ‘The recovery is in sight but it is too weak to be satisfactory.’ He added that a premature rate increase would kill off the recovery by hammering households and firms unable to deal with higher borrowing costs. Sir Mervyn also played down the prospect of higher interest rates in other nations, saying ‘we are nowhere near’ a return to normal, and that those expecting imminent rate rises ‘have rather jumped the gun’. He lambasted governments around the world for not using the breathing space provided by central banks to take tough decisions needed to stabilise the global economy. Outgoing governor Sir Mervyn King said rate increases were a long way off and only if the economy recovers . The eurozone ‘remains a tremendous problem’ for the global economy, and in particular Britain, he added. His comments came as the ailing British property market was boosted by a 24 per cent rise in mortgage approvals. After five years in the doldrums, 7,000 more home loans were taken out in May, compared with the same month last year when 36,102 were approved, according to the British Bankers Association (BBA). The value of home loans in May was £5.5billion – the highest level for 16 months. The revival was confirmed by a second study that reported a surge in the number of homes being put on the market for more than £500,000. The figure is expected to have risen by 19 per cent in the second three months of 2013 compared with a year ago, while it is predicted to have increased 26 per cent in London and the West Midlands. An image of Jane Austen could replace Charles Darwin on the £10 note . An image of Pride And  Prejudice author Jane Austen could be used on a new £10 note, it emerged yesterday. Departing Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King said that the novelist is ‘quietly waiting in the wings’ to replace Charles Darwin. The move follows the row over the choice of Sir Winston Churchill to take over from prison reformer Elizabeth Fry on the fiver, which would have seen a return to an all-male line-up on banknotes. The Bank has not yet made a decision on when the £5 note will be changed or who will be on it. But Sir Mervyn yesterday told the Treasury select committee: ‘The figure we’ve been working with for two years is Jane Austen.’ She would be only the third female historical figure to appear on bank-notes since 1970, following Fry and pioneering nurse Florence Nightingale. The final decision on who will appear will be taken by Sir Mervyn’s successor, Mark Carney. A possible supporter for more women may be Mr Carney’s wife, Diana, who has campaigned for greater equality and voiced support for the anti-capitalist Occupy movement.","Canadian Mark Carney said businesses should prepare for 'slight or material change' in the level of interest rates .

"PUBLISHED: . 11:37 EST, 24 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:48 EST, 24 June 2013 . 'Murdered': Thomas Lang, 91, died after his grandson Stephen grabbed him round the neck and stole his £300 pension money, a court heard . A teenager murdered his frail grandfather during a botched robbery for his £300 pension money, a court heard today. Stephen Lang grabbed 91-year-old Thomas Lang, 'broke his neck' and pushed him to the floor during the attack in the early hours of April 17 last year. Lang, now 20, went to his bedroom and stole £300 from a wallet that was hidden under a pillow. He then fled, leaving his grandfather seriously hurt on the floor of his home in Launceston, Cornwall. Despite his injuries, Mr Lang was able to summon help at 1.44am on a lifeline alarm that he wore around his neck, Truro Crown Court heard. Simon Laws QC, prosecuting, told jurors: 'In the early hours of April 17 last year Stephen Lang paid a visit to his grandfather. 'He attacked him and he inflicted very serious injuries upon him. 'He broke his neck and he caused injuries to the structures of the throat. Mr Lang died from his injuries a few days later in hospital. 'The motive had been robbery. The defendant stole a few hundred pounds while his grandfather was lying on the floor unable to move.' Carers alerted the pensioner’s son, Keith - who is Stephen Lang's uncle - and he rushed to his father’s sheltered housing flat in Trecarn Close. Mr Lang discovered the flat door slightly ajar, signs of a disturbance with the coffee table knocked over and his elderly father on the floor of the lounge. The pensioner asked his son to call the police and then told him what had happened. 'He said Stephen Lang had come to the flat saying that he had just finished work,' Mr Laws said. 'He had then attacked his grandfather, grabbing him around the neck. Thomas Lang thought the defendant had been trying to break his neck. 'He had one arm around the front of his neck and one arm around the back. He was terrified to move because his neck was painful.' Mr Laws said that Keith Lang dialled 999 and asked for the police and an ambulance. The operator spoke to his father, who told them: 'My grandson came in, I don’t know for what reason. He came in and attacked me. Passed away: Mr Lang died in hospital in Plymouth from pneumonia related to his injuries a few days after the alleged attack . 'He was twisting my neck and that. I am lying on the ground now and I just can’t move.' The pensioner told the operator that there was £300 of his pension money missing from his wallet and added: 'I would have given him some if he’d asked.' The court heard that there was also between £8,000 and £10,000 locked in a safe in his wardrobe of the ground-floor flat. Mr Lang was taken to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth for treatment and told medical staff: 'I can’t believe this has happened.' The pensioner later told police that his grandson had 'lost everything - his temper, his sense'. Independent: The 91-year-old grandfather was described as frail but was able to live on his own in sheltered housing . Mr Lang deteriorated and sadly succumbed to his injuries three days later in hospital. A post-mortem examination found he had died from pneumonia caused by the injuries he suffered. 'The injuries were of a kind seen in those who died as a result of neck compression,' Mr Laws said. 'To cause those injuries took force - force that was quite deliberately applied. No-one could apply force of that severity to a man of any age without intending to cause really serious harm. 'To use force of that kind against a man of Mr Lang’s age - in his physical condition - invites one conclusion only, the prosecution say, that the defendant intended to cause really serious harm. 'What else could he have intended? Remember what Mr Lang had said: that he thought the defendant had been trying to break his neck.' The court heard that Mr Lang was at the head of a large family - many of whom lived in the local area - including the defendant. The pensioner, who walked with the aid of a trolley, received four visits a day from carers who helped him with washing, dressing and eating. His GP said he was 'frail but relatively independent' and in 'good health'. Mr Laws said Mr Lang 'spoke warmly' to others about his grandson. 'There does not appear to have been any trouble between the two of them until April 17 when the defendant decided to attack and rob him,' he said. The jury heard he had an ‘expensive drug habit’ two years before which cost him £140 a day to satisfy, said Mr Laws. He added that Lang had said that he had been drinking . all night and had been to three local pubs but CCTV showed him walking . competently and using a mobile phone to call a taxi. Trial: Stephen Lang, 20, pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of his grandfather but denies murder . He lied to police before admitting he had argued with his grandfather after the old man had called him ‘a waste of space’. But he said he pulled his walking trolley away from him causing him to he fell to the floor and he panicked and took the cash and left. Mr Laws said: 'He was adamant he had not touched his grandfather’s neck. He did not know why he had not dialled 999.' Lang, of Launceston, Cornwall denies murder. However, before the trial was due to start today he accepted he had killed his grandfather by pleading guilty to manslaughter - a plea not accepted by the Crown. Mr Laws told the jury of five men and seven women: 'We say it is a case of murder. 'The question in the case really is this. At the time he attacked Thomas Lang did the defendant intend to cause really serious harm to him? 'If he did, he is guilty of murder. If he did not, he is not guilty of murder but guilty only of manslaughter - the offence to which he has already pleaded guilty.'

It was once claimed that a pram in the hall is the enemy of good art. But Zadie Smith has launched an impassioned defence of writers with children – pointing out that Charles Dickens had ten. The White Teeth author, who has juggled her career with raising two children, entered an online debate over the late writer Cyril Connolly, who declared: ‘There is no more sombre enemy of good art than the pram in the hall.’ Miss Smith, 37, replied: ‘I have two children. Dickens had ten.’ Referring also to Tolstoy, who had fourteen children, she asked: ‘Did anyone worry that those men were becoming too father-ish to be writer-esque? The idea that motherhood is inherently somehow a threat to creativity is just absurd.’ Miss Smith, a Cambridge graduate, has two young children with her husband, poet Nick Laird. She urged the Government to help working mothers by addressing the high cost of childcare. ‘What IS a threat to all women’s freedoms is the issue of time, which is the same problem whether you are a writer, factory worker or nurse,’ she said. ‘We need decent public day-care services, partners who do their share, affordable childcare and a supportive community of friends and family.’ She added that having children had helped her creatively. ‘Two kids entertaining each other in one room gives their mother in another room a surprising amount of free time she would not have otherwise,’ she said. Defiant: Miss Smith argued the Government should do more to try and help working mothers with the high cost of childcare . Her intervention came after US author Lauren Sandler suggested that female authors should limit themselves to one child. Sandler, who is promoting her book on the subject, cited Susan Sontag and Joan Didion as her examples of successful writers who stuck to having one child. But it wasn’t long before other women writers took up arms, including Pulitzer Prize-winning Jane Smiley. Smiley wrote: ‘I have three children of my own and two stepchildren. ‘The key is not having one child, it is living in a place where there is excellent daycare and a social world that allows fathers to have the time and the motivation to fully share in raising kids.’ Adding her own comments, Miss Smith went on to name Marilynne Robinson and Toni Morrison as writers who have visited the labour ward more than once. Smith won the Orange Prize for Fiction in 2006 and her novel White Teeth was included in Time magazine’s TIME 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005 list. In April, she was selected as one of Britain’s best young novelists by Granta, the literary magazine.","Author said the idea that motherhood is a threat to creativity is 'absurd'

The poodle cat: A Selkirk Rex, which has just been declared a breed of its own by scientists . The breed can be any colour and can be long or short-haired . The kitten stood out from the rest of the litter for her unusual curly coat when she was born to a feral cat in Montana in 1987, reports Mother Nature Network. Her curls were the result of a spontaneous gene mutation that only affected her. Jeri Newman, a breeder of Persian cats, adopted the kitten and named her after Agnes DiPesto, the curly-haired receptionist in American television series Moonlighting, which starred Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd. Researchers at the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna say that the Selkirk Rex is genetically distinct from other breeds and is the fourth type of curly-haired cat. A grey Selkirk Rex on the prowl: The breed is not suitable for those with allergies because of its plush coat . The curls are caused by a dominant gene, so the felines can be cross-bred with other cats and keep its signature fur. Unlike short-haired Cornish Rex, Devon Rex and German Rex cats, there are also long-haired varieties of the breed and their fur can come in a wide range of colours. They are not suitable for people with allergies as they frequently shed their plush coat.","Every Selkirk Rex can be traced to Miss DiPesto, a cat born in 1987 .

In a major blow to civil rights activists, the Supreme Court on Tuesday struck down an important part of a 48-year-old federal law designed to protect minority voters. The court ruled on a 5-4 vote in favor of officials from Shelby County, Alabama, in finding that a section of the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act that sets the formula that determines which states need federal approval to change voting laws is invalid. The court, split on ideological lines, did not go as far as striking down Section 5 of the law, which required certain states, mainly in the South, to show that any proposed election-law change does not discriminate against black, Latino or other minority voters. Scroll down for video . Big decisions: The Supreme Court handed down their decision about the Voting Rights Act on Tuesday which was one of the most hotly-anticipated decisions . But a majority did invalidate Section 4 of the act, which sets the formula for states covered by Section 5 and was based on historic patterns of discrimination against minority voters. Although Section 5 is technically left intact, it is effectively nullified, at least for the near future, as Congress would now need to pass new legislation setting a new formula before it can be applied again. As a result, the ruling is a heavy blow for civil rights advocates, who believe the loss of a working preclearance program could lead to an increase in attempts to deter minorities from voting. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, joined by her three liberal colleagues, dissented from Tuesday's ruling. Ginsburg said no one doubts that voting discrimination still exists 'but the court today terminates the remedy that proved to be best suited to block that discrimination,' she said in a dissent that she read aloud in the packed courtroom. The ruling on the Voting Rights Act is one of the most closely-watched Supreme Court disputes in the past year. Seeing the racial issues: NAACP representatives spoke out on the steps of the Supreme Court . Protecting minorities: The Voting Rights Act was in place to make sure that many voting locations in the South and places with a history of racial issues are not used in a discriminatory way . The case centers on the civil rights-era law that broadly prohibited poll taxes, literacy tests and other measures that prevented blacks from voting. In the 1960s, such laws existed throughout the country but were more prevalent in the South with its legacy of slavery. The issue of voting rights remains prominent in the United States as judges nationwide heard challenges to new voter identification laws and redrawn voting districts during the 2012 presidential election. The Obama administration, backed by civil rights advocates, had argued that the provision was still needed to deter voter discrimination. His issued a statement condemning the decision shortly after it was handed down. 'I am deeply disappointed with the Supreme Court’s decision today,' President Obama said in the release. Breaking the news: The Voting Rights Act is just one of the landmark decisions expected to come this week, as affirmative action was handed down yesterday and DOMA is expected tomorrow . 'Today’s decision invalidating one of its core provisions upsets decades of well-established practices that help make sure voting is fair, especially in places where voting discrimination has been historically prevalent. 'As a nation, we’ve made a great deal of progress towards guaranteeing every American the right to vote. But, as the Supreme Court recognized, voting discrimination still exists.' Just last week, the Supreme Court struck down an Arizona state law that required people registering to vote in federal elections to show proof of citizenship, a victory for activists who said it discouraged Native Americans and Latinos from voting. Democrats say that and similar measures, championed by Republicans at the state level, were intended to make it more difficult for certain voters who tend to vote Democratic to cast ballots.","President Obama blasted the ruling saying he was 'deeply disappointed'

Bradford, whose 28 novels about powerful women have amassed her a fortune of £200 million, has slammed erotic fiction Fifty Shades Of Grey . as repetitive, badly written and 'not even sexy'. The British writer, 80, said that the EL James' novel, which became the top-selling book in Britain since records began when it was published in June 2011, is 'terribly badly written'. Speaking to the Radio Times, Taylor Bradford also admonished 'hero' character Christian Grey as 'every woman's worst nightmare, although he's rich'. Barbara Taylor Bradford, left, today said she was not a fan of Fifty Shades Of Grey by EL James, calling it 'repetitive' and 'terribly badly written' British writer EL James with the first installment of her erotic trilogy, Fifty Shades Of Grey, which was today dismissed by Barbara Taylor Bradford as 'terribly written' and 'not even sexy' Dismissing fellow British writer James' trilogy as 'repetitive and not even sexy', she went on: 'When the female character has her bottom . smacked with a whip it's the end of the book, except her saying, 'Holy . cow!' in excitement.' In her outspoken interview, Taylor Bradford, whose novels often feature ambitious young women rising to the top, also said that in the real world such such success only stirs up jealousy and resentment among other females. She said: 'Some women can be a bit devious, especially if you're successful. They're jealous and envious, although they'd be afraid to display that with me. I'd punch them in the face.' 'Wired differently': Barbara Taylor Bradford picture with her husband, Bob . A Fleet Street journalist before she became an author, the 80-year-old said: 'I was born ambitious, determined, driven, so nothing was going to stop me following my dream. I didn't see myself as a feminist.' Miss Taylor Bradford, whose personal wealth is thought to be close to £200million, added: ‘I never had any harassment, or feeling up. ‘It’s strange today that the slightest compliment can be seen as harassment. It’s this generation. I don’t know why.’ Outspoken: Barbara Taylor Bradford says: 'It's strange today that the slightest compliment can be seen as harassment' Long lasting: Miss Taylor Bradford has been married to Bob for 50 years . She has been married to film producer Bob Bradford for 50 years and revealed that he calls her Napoleon because she is ‘bossy, dictatorial’ and can become ‘shrill’ – while she refers to him as Bismarck because of his German origins. After decades of marital bliss, she has clearly learnt a thing or two about how to maintain a happy personal life. Her advice is to accept that ‘men and women are wired differently’. Interview: Miss Taylor Bradford's interview in full is in this month's Radio Times . Miss Taylor Bradford whose works include A Woman Of Substance and a series of books on How To Be The Perfect Wife, told Radio Times: ‘I used to think it was true what mummy said – a woman makes a marriage work – but now I think the man has to put something into it, too. ‘When my 31-year-old goddaughter has problems with her husband I tell her, “Keep your mouth shut and do your own thing”. ‘Bob apologises for small things – “Sorry I broke that plate” – but never says sorry when we have an argument. Men can be stubborn and can’t multitask.’ Appearance clearly still matters to Miss Taylor Bradford, who confessed that she has used Botox and had eye surgery, but has not had a facelift – and insists the only pills she takes are vitamins. The author, who lives in a New York penthouse, may enjoy a jet-set lifestyle but she is only too aware of the humble roots of her family. She has taken part in a new ITV series Secrets From The Workhouse, in which she tells how her grandmother was forced into a workhouse and gave birth to two illegitimate children. A 2004 biography by Piers Dudgeon revealed that Miss Taylor Bradford’s mother Freda was illegitimate – probably the daughter of the Marquess of Ripon, for whom her grandmother, Edith, was a maid – and had been in a workhouse.","Said 'hero' Christian Grey was most women's 'worst nightmare'

Three men in an auto-rickshaw are said to have grabbed the woman and driven her to an isolated spot where they are alleged to have raped her, leaving her with a broken leg and back and neck injuries. Attack: The medical student, 22, was gang-raped by three men who snatched her as she walked back to her room from the library at Manipal University in Karnataka . The student was admitted to hospital for treatment on Thursday night and is now said to be 'out of danger'.

Best-selling author Iain Banks lost his battle with cancer yesterday – weeks after marrying his partner and just days before the publication of his final novel. The 59-year-old, who wrote The Wasp Factory, stunned his many fans in April when he revealed he was suffering from gall bladder cancer and that he  was ‘unlikely’ to survive longer than  a year. With typical dark humour he said he was ‘officially very poorly’ and revealed he had  asked his long-term partner Adele  Hartley, 42, an author and horror film curator, if she would ‘do me the honour of becoming my widow’. They married in a humanist ceremony in the Scottish Highlands over the Easter weekend before a short honeymoon in Venice and Paris. From then she jokingly referred to herself as ‘chief widow-in-waiting’. Yesterday she issued a statement through Banks’s website, saying: ‘Iain died in the early hours this morning. His death was calm and without pain.’ Banks passed away just three weeks after being presented with finished copies of his final book The Quarry, which is about a man who is dying of cancer, ahead of its release on June 20. In a statement his publisher Little, Brown said he was ‘an irreplaceable part of the literary world’ and ‘one of the country’s best-loved novelists’. Banks, who also wrote science fiction novels as Iain M Banks, revealed his terminal illness on his blog in April, a month after his diagnosis. He wrote: ‘The bottom line, now, I’m afraid, is that as a late stage gall bladder cancer patient, I’m expected to live for “several months” and it’s extremely unlikely I’ll live beyond a year.’ Praising the ‘professionalism’ of the NHS, he said a course of chemotherapy might extend his life for ‘several months’ but that he would withdraw from all planned public engagements. Widow: Iain Banks (right) announced in April he had married his long-term partner Adele Hartley (left) as he revealed he was suffering with cancer . Legacy: Before his death Banks completed his final novel The Quarry which is to be published on June 20 . Later Banks, who was born in Fife, . Scotland, used his website Banksophilia, set up to provide updates on . his health, to thank his fans for their support. He said: ‘I feel treasured. I am deeply flattered and touched, and I can’t deny I’ve been made to feel very special indeed.’ Last month he added: ‘Still knocked . out by the love and depth of feeling coming from so many people; thank . you, all of you. It means a lot, almost more than I can say, and – . whatever type or size of screen I read the comments on – I come away . from the computer, laptop, iPad or phone with a happy smile on my face.’ Before he died, Banks decided to write thank-you letters to his favourite authors telling them how much he valued their work. Award-winning: Banks was named by The Times newspaper as one of the 50 greatest living authors in 2008 . The author said he did not expect to live longer than a year and died of cancer just two months after announcing he was terminally ill . Banks published his first novel The Wasp Factory in 1984 and his debut sci-fi title, Consider Phlebas, came three years later. The Crow Road, which opens with the . memorable line ‘It was the day my grandmother exploded’, was adapted for . a popular television series in 1996. In 2008 Banks was named as one of . the 50 greatest British writers since 1945. The Quarry describes the physical and . emotional strains in the final weeks of Guy, who has terminal cancer and . is being looked after by his teenage son. It reveals the difficulties Guy faces, from using a walking frame to his opposition to alternative treatments. Crime writer Ian Rankin, a friend of . Banks for many years, paid tribute to his sense of humour, saying: ‘He . was refusing to take cancer seriously, in the same way that he refused . to take life seriously. He was a great guy to hang around with and . somebody for whom life and the world were a fictional template for him . to do as he pleased.’ Sci-fi author Ken McLeod said: ‘I . think he has left us a very  significant body of work, both in . mainstream literature and science fiction and he’s also left a large gap . in the Scottish literary scene  as well as the wider English-speaking . world.’ Trainspotting author Irvine Welsh said: ‘I’m off out to the pub to toast one of my all time literary heroes with a malt.’ The gallbladder concentrates and stores bile from the liver as part of the digestive system. Gallbladder cancer is rare in the UK but is more common among women. It does not cause symptoms in the early stages, grows quickly and is often not diagnosed until the cancer has spread. Most early-stage cancers are found by chance. At more advanced stages, symptoms include jaundice, abdominal pain and nausea. If the cancer is diagnosed early enough, surgery is the most effective treatment. As it advances it can spread to lymph nodes, the liver and other organs. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy can be used to stem its spread but only one patient in ten with advanced gallbladder cancer survives for five years. Vanda Taylor, of Cancer Research UK, said: ‘Gallbladder cancer is seldom diagnosed early and therefore can be very difficult to treat successfully.’","The Scottish author revealed he was terminally ill in April .

The ground crew worker wore parts of a pilot's official uniform and was given access to the cockpit of an A380 Superjumbo during the flight from Dubai to Sydney. Now a union has sent a furious letter to Qantas about the incident after a group of angry pilots complained. A ground crew worker masqueraded as a pilot to spend hours in the cockpit during a Qantas flight from Sydney to Dubai . Richard Woodward, vice president of the Australian and International Pilots Association, told The Age: 'It was stupid. She was sitting in the cockpit for a large percentage of the flight,' he said. 'I think it was naive and silly.' According to the airline, the woman was wearing 'parts' of a pilot's uniform, but they were unable to explain why. A spokesman said she was sitting in the cockpit for 'operational reasons' and that she had not tried to deceive the flight crew who were all well aware of her true identity. 'We're examining precisely why this . happened. However, it's clear that the staff member was on the flight . deck for operational reasons and was not in any way trying to deceive . the flight crew, who knew the staff member wasn't a pilot,' the airline . said in a statement. The . woman who is understood to work in Qantas's navigation department, had . been issued a 'red' Australian Security Identification Card, which . allowed her entry to restricted areas, including the cockpit, provided . she has the captain's permission. Inspiration? Leonardo DiCaprio starred as a man who masquerades as a pilot in the 2002 film Catch Me If You Can . She had worn the pilot's uniforms on both the trip from Sydney to Dubai as well as the return flight. She had been booked onto the flight and had been expected to sit with the crew. Mr Woodward added: 'She is purporting to be somebody she is not. 'At the company's direction, they put a person on the flight deck dressed as a pilot who is not a pilot. It is not appropriate under any circumstances. The pilots are all up in arms.' In the event of an emergency, he said the flight attendants on the A380s would have looked to her for direction because she was dressed as a pilot.

The glasses, which cost $1,500 a pair (£980), are currently on limited release to 2,000 people but will be more widely available later this year.

The light is not visible to the human eye, but on film it is so bright that you cannot see the person's face . But lead researcher professor Isao Echizen of the National Institute of Informatics in Japan said they were working on reflective materials which will have the same effect and be less obtrusive. He said: ‘Light from these near infrared LEDs can’t be seen by the human eye, but when it passes through the camera’s imaging device, it appears bright’. In a video posted online by the NII he also says that he developed the technology because he is especially worried about facial recognition software which has not yet been developed, but could soon come in the future. Wearing sunglasses is not enough and will not stop your face from being detected as you can be identified using your nose as well as your eyes.

A fixed security camera picks up the sleek silhouette of the big cat as it strolls into the lobby. Warning: Graphic content . On the prowl: The fully grown wild leopard wanders into the lobby of an apartment in Mulund, northeast of Mumbai, India . Closing in: The wild leopard moves towards the pet dog - seen in the bottom right corner of the shot - in these shocking CCTV images . Pounce: The CCTV cameras in the lobby capture the moment the wild cat grabs the oblivious dog by the throat . The lightly coloured dog can be seen curled up, possibly asleep, in the bottom right of shot - oblivious to the approaching predator. Within a few seconds the leopard has closed in on the unsuspecting pet. By the time the canine realises it is in mortal danger, the leopard clamps its jaws around the dog's throat. Struggle: The unsuspecting dog writhes around in an attempt to free itself . Grabbed: The cameras show the prone dog desperately try to force the wild cat to loosen its grip on its throat . The pet ferociously struggles in vain to . free itself from the cat's vice-like-grip, as it is dragged towards the . exit, during the video clip. The leopard pauses for a moment, standing its front legs on its stricken prey, then darts towards the open doors. The entire attack lasts little more . than seven seconds before the dog is pulled out of camera shot and into the . darkness of the Mumbai streets, where it is assumed it was eaten. Leopards have mauled or killed more . than 100 people over the past decade in and around Mumbai and official . attempts to solve the problem were making it worse. The problem or wild cat attacks is not restricted to India. Struggle: The leopard dwarfs the smaller pet as it is dragged towards the exit . Pause: The large cat rests for a split second as it heads towards the exit with the dog in its jaws . Earlier this year, marksmen had to shoot dead a leopard which seriously injured 15 people - including three police officers - after wandering into a suburb of Kathmandu. A furious crowd dragged the mortally wounded animal through the streets of Gothatar on the outskirts of Kathmandu at. Graphic photographs capture residents fleeing for their lives as the leopard prowled between buildings. Hopeless: The wild cat forces the stricken pet dog towards the street outside the Mumbai apartment . Disappear: The last few frames of footage show the cat taking its prey off into the dark night . Armed police from Metropolitan Police . Circle, Koteshwor, were on the scene within minutes and managed to . corner the animal, but not before it had mauled more than a dozen . residents. Upto three policemen and two . officials from the Department of Forest were injured as they tried to . trap the wild cat, according to local reports. Police said that all the injured were rushed to Mother Land Hospital, Pepsicola for the medical treatment.","Wild cat snatches the animal from the lobby of an apartment in Mumbai, India ."

'He went to the house today and when there was no reply at the door, he . went inside. Inside he saw the man dead on the sofa and immediately . called the Guardia Civil.

Carrying just four pounds too many can raise your risk of heart disease by a fifth, according to new research. A large scale study found being overweight really does cause Britain’s biggest killer - as well as diabetes. Alarmingly, an increase of only one unit of BMI (body mass index), equivalent to 4 to 12lbs depending on height, made the participants 20 per cent more likely to develop heart failure. Meanwhile, obesity also led to higher levels of insulin, higher blood pressure, higher cholesterol and inflammation and more cases of diabetes. Professor Erik Ingelsson, of Uppsala University, Sweden, said: ‘This knowledge is important, as it strengthens the evidence forceful societal measures need to be taken to counteract the epidemic of obesity and its consequences.’ His team used a new method to investigate the link between weight and cardiovascular disease because, despite previous evidence, it has not been clear whether too much fat was just a marker of another underlying cause. The study, published in the journal PLOS Medicine, was an attempt to determine whether obesity as such is the actual cause or a signal of another lifestyle factor that triggers these diseases. Dr Tove Fall, also of Uppsala University, said: ‘We knew already obesity and cardiovascular disease often occur together. However, it has been hard to determine whether increased BMI as such is dangerous. ‘In this study we found individuals with gene variants that lead to increased body-mass index (BMI) also had an increased risk of heart failure and diabetes. The risk of developing diabetes was greater than was previously thought.’ The researchers analysed whether a mutation in the FTO gene, which regulates the appetite and increases an individual’s BMI, was also linked to a series of cardiovascular diseases and metabolism. This risk variant is common in the population, and each copy increases BMI by an average of between 0.3 and 0.4 points. Since an individual’s genome is not affected by lifestyle and social factors, but rather is established at conception when the embryo randomly receives half of each parent’s genome, the method is called ‘Mendelian randomization’. To achieve reliable results a large group was required, so almost 200,000 individuals from Europe and Australia were recruited. Professor Ingelsson said: ‘Epidemiological studies look for associations in large populations, but it is usually difficult to reliably determine cause and effect - what we call causality. ‘By using this new genetic method, . Mendelian randomization, in our research we can now confirm what many . people have long believed, that increased BMI contributes to the . development of heart failure. We also found that being overweight causes . increases in liver enzymes. This can lead to liver disease.’ An increase of only one unit of BMI, equivalent to between 4 and 12lbs depending on a person's height, makes a person 20 per cent more likely to develop heart failure . BMI . is calculated by taking your weight, in kilograms, and dividing it by . your height squared, in metres, and is a way to compare the weights of . groups of people of different heights. Underweight is a BMI under 18.5, normal is between 18.5 and 25, between 25 and 30 is overweight and above 30 is obese. Coronary heart disease causes about 82,000 deaths each year in the UK. An estimated 70,000 to 75,000 people with diabetes die in England every year, accounting for about 15 per cent of all deaths. Tam Fry, spokesman for the National Obesity Forum and chairman of the Child Growth Foundation, described the findings as ‘very important’. He said: ‘What is really exciting is they have pinned down causality, which is essential when coming up with any pronouncement like this. ‘It is not a totally new method, it has been around for about fifteen years, but the database is so large you can now say “hand on heart” being overweight causes heart failure. This is the final evidence. ‘Measuring BMI has been criticised as an inexact science, and has been rubbished, but if you monitored patients over a long period it could become extremely exact. ‘A BMI of 30 is obese, and if it then rises to 31, 32, 33, and 34 which is morbidly obese, if your risk of heart failure is going up by 20 per cent each time then you could be a goner.’","An increase of just one BMI point can raise heart disease risk by a fifth .

Euan Blair will marry his girlfriend of eight years Suzanne Ashman on September 14 at his parents' mansion in the Buckinghamshire countryside, it emerged today. Euan, 29, and Suzanne, 25, who were introduced by former defence secretary Geoff Hoon, will have an autumn wedding at South Pavilion, the Grade I-listed house in Wotton Underwood bought by the Blairs for £4m in 2008. The former Prime Minister and his wife Cherie are understood to be planning a spectacular party for the couple, who bought a house together in Islington at the end of last year and got engaged over Christmas. Euan Blair, 29, is to marry his long-term girlfriend Suzanne Ashman, 25, in Buckinghamshire in September . The new Mr and Mrs Blair will celebrate their wedding with a party at South Pavilion in Buckinghamshire . Euan, who graduated from the University of Bristol with a 2:1 in history, worked as an intern at the House of Representatives in the U.S. before joining the American merchant bank Morgan Stanley. Last year he quit his job and became a business development manager at the Coventry-based Sarina Russo Job Access, part of the government's Work Programme, in a move said by some to be a stepping stone towards following his father into politics. Some believe his job in the Midlands is a shrewd move which would boost his chances, should he try, of winning the Labour seat of Coventry North West, from which current MP Geoffrey Robinson may retire in 2015. Privately-educated Miss Ashman read PPE at Trinity College, Oxford, after leaving St Paul's Girls' School in London.  She did work experience with Mr Hoon, during which she met Euan, and went on to work for Tony Blair's Faith Foundation. Miss Ashman, who is now an analyst for Social Finance, which helps raise funds from private investors for good causes, gets on well with her future in-laws and has been on several holidays with them over the years. Unlike Euan's, Miss Ashman's parents are divorced.  Her wealthy motor racing entrepreneur father John Ashman has married weathergirl (and former fiancee of Lembit Opik) Sian Lloyd, and her mother is the daughter of a former Turkish government minister and one-time mayor of Ankara. Wedding planners: Cherie and Tony Blair are understood to be planning a spectacular party for Euan and Suzanne . Euan Blair and Suzanne Ashman, pictured here in 2007, were introduced by Geoff Hoon . Euan is the eldest of the Blairs' four children, and the first of them to marry, but whether it will be a Roman Catholic wedding remains to be seen. Euan, like his younger brother Nicky, 27, was brought up Catholic and attended the popular Catholic Oratory school in west London before going to Bristol.  His mother is a Catholic, and his father joined the Catholic Church in 2007. Whatever the style of the wedding, the Blairs (whose fortune runs to some £60m) are expected to throw a good party. In 2000, a then 16-year-old Euan was picked up by police after being found drunk and incapable in Leicester Square. Mrs Blair's colourful family are expected to be invited, including her Muslim convert sister Lauren, but there is doubt as to whether their frail father, actor Tony Booth, will be well enough to attend.

She has the sort of flawless complexion normally associated with the most expensive face creams. But look inside Alison Steadman’s bathroom cabinet and you might be in for a surprise. The TV actress has revealed she didn’t start moisturising until she was 40 - and said her favourite product is a pot of Nivea Crème costing £3.99. Miss Steadman, 66, was the star of Abigail’s Party and Gavin & Stacey, and has two sons from her marriage to director Mike Leigh, whom she divorced in 2001. In an interview with Yours magazine, she spoke of her health fears as she grows older, and revealed she harbours secret regrets for failing to give her own mother Marjorie enough attention before she died in 1966. The veteran star currently plays a discontented housewife in ITV comedy Love and Marriage. Explaining her youthful complexion, Miss Steadman said: ‘It must be my genes. I’ve always had good skin. I never had spots or acne as a teenager, and I never used to moisturise until I was about 40. ‘I’m not showing off - it’s just that I never needed it. ‘I once spent a fortune - and I mean like a week’s wages - on a tube of moisturiser, because I thought, I’m in my 60s so I’m going to treat myself. ‘I put it on and a couple of days later I got spots. Now I use Nivea, which costs £3.99, and my skin is fine.’ Miss Steadman is not the only star to swear by the classic skin cream. Invented in 1911, it contains more than 30 of the same ingredients found in the luxury Crème de la Mer, which costs £190 for a 60ml pot. Budget buy: Alison Steadman says that she once spent a fortune on a face cream that left her with spots, but with Nivea Creme her face is fine . Other fans include screen veteran Joan Collins, 80, and Kate Winslet, 37. Miss Steadman also credited her healthy diet for helping keep her skin looking young, saying: ‘I am also very fussy about what I eat and I think that helps. ‘I’m not faddy but I do try to eat well. I love raw vegetables and fresh fruit, and only eat meat about twice a week. ‘We all have health fears as we get older, and who knows, I might get diagnosed with something tomorrow, but I’m doing my best to be healthy although occasionally I’ll have some chips. And I do like a glass or two of wine.’ Fans: Both Joan Collins, left, and Kate Winslet, right, have also admitted that they prefer to use Nivea than more expensive creams . The actress, who lives in north London with her partner, actor Michael Elwyn, also spoke about the death of her mother from cancer. She said: ‘I often think back to the odd times when she’d be telling me something and I remember kind of brushing over it, being to busy and not really listening to her. ‘My biggest regret has to be after dad died; I bought Mum a radio because I thought it would be company for her to listen to in bed at night. ‘It was - and she loved it. But one night when I was sleeping in the room next to hers, a song came on the radio that my dad, who was very musical, used to love. Mum started to cry and then she was howling. I could hear her pain and kept thinking I should go to her, but I didn’t know if I could face it.

Latoya Smith, 10, was wearing earphones when she was hit by a lorry as she tried to cross the road on her way to school . A ten-year-old girl, who was killed by a lorry as she tried to cross the road on her way to school, was wearing earphones, an inquest was told today. Latoya Smith was changing buses because there was so much traffic on the road when she was struck by a lorry in Peckham. She died of her injuries in January, 2010. An inquest into her death heard today that the schoolgirl attempted to cross the road near a junction where temporary traffic lights had been installed. The usual pedestrian crossing had been closed, and a sign was also put up that said 'No Crossing Here'. Witnesses told the jury inquest at Southwark Coroners' Court that she had one earphone in her ear after she was hit and the other was lying on the ground. Abisamad Abdulle said the little girl was hit when she was almost half way across the road. He said: 'The lorry ran over her leg and back. I don’t think he saw her because he didn’t stop for a while. 'When I got to her, she was on the ground, her hood was up and I saw one earphone in her ear and the other on the ground,' reported News Shopper. Latoya, from Penge, south east London, was on her way to the Camelot Primary School in Peckham. She was taken to King’s College Hospital in Denmark Hill after she was knocked down at the corner of East Dulwich Road and Peckham Rye, but died of her injuries. Her mother Grace Johnson said her daughter was a talented athlete and wanted to be a teacher when she was older. Ms Johnson had walked Latoya to the bus stop but was told hours later her daughter had been in an accident. Latoya died from her injuries after being was knocked down at the junction of Peckham Rye and East Dulwich Road, pictured . She told the hearing that Latoya had good road sense and that she had previously told her not to change buses. Ms Johnson added that Latoya, who was weeks away from her eleventh birthday when she died, was a 'caring girl' who volunteered in fundraisers, according to The Evening Standard. Christine Milton, who worked at Latoya's school, told the inquest the schoolgirl may have been worried about being late for class. She said Latoya often liked to help out in the mornings and did not like being late. Latoya's mother Grace Johnson told Southwark Coroners' Court that her daughter had good road sense . Another witness, Christine Waldron, who was driving behind the lorry said Latoya 'came out of nowhere'. News Shopper quoted her as saying: 'After the accident I banged on the lorry window and the driver said to me, ""I think I just killed a little girl"" but I said I thought she was still alive because she was moving. 'I’m sorry but she was not at the crossing.' The inquest is due to last for five days and will continue tomorrow.","Latoya Smith died of her injuries after being hit in January, 2010 .

Spending cuts have fallen more heavily on Britain’s young people who have been failed by the government, Nick Clegg has admitted. The Deputy Prime Minister claimed hundreds of millions of pounds have been wasted on a ‘hotchpotch’ of schemes which have failed to stem the tide of youth unemployment. And he renewed his call for the axe to fall on benefits for wealthy pensioners, as he accused the Tories of having a ‘tin ear’ on the need for fairness in cutting the welfare state. Warning: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said young people had suffered most from spending cuts, and admitted the government was wasting millions on schemes which did not work . A damning report today revealed young people in the UK spend almost two-and-a-half years out of work on average, longer than those in many other developed nations. Mr Clegg claimed many young people feel ‘short-changed’ with help directed at other groups. ‘What we’ve got to avoid as a country, because it’s very dangerous in my view, is a sense that we’re setting up one generation against another,’ he said. Chancellor George Osborne will announce tomorrow where £11.5billion of extra cuts will fall in 2015-16. Nick Clegg admitted he is a 'terrible cook' and warned against anyone sampling his efforts in the kitchen. The Lib Dem leader, who has been mocked for putting on weight since the coalition was formed, said he likes to eat good food - but is unable to produce it himself. He said: Oh, I’m an appalling cook. I’m an atrocious cook. 'I wouldn’t recommend any of my cooking to anybody, I really wouldn’t. 'I love eating, so I’m a great consumer of good food but I’m a rubbish producer of good food.' He has insisted that schools will be protected as an ‘investment in our economic future’. But in an interview with LibDemVoice website, Mr Clegg said the government was failing young people. ‘We’ve got a much bigger issue, which is a generational issue as we all know, which is that the squeeze has fallen harder on the shoulders of the younger generation. ‘That’s why I’ve come to the view that one of the urgent bits of work we need to do both in government and more widely is look at the way in which we support particularly that generation of 16-24 year olds. ‘The education-into-work group… are very poorly served at the moment by a hotchpotch of different and often conflicting government initiatives which are very confusing, a pea-soup of acronyms, and the money is not well spent. ‘One of my top priorities over this summer is to really get to grips with this, because we’re spending hundreds of millions of pounds as a society and we’re not serving them well at all.’ Mr Clegg has seen off an attempt by Education Secretary Michael Gove to cut a £380billion plan to extend free nursery care to the poorest under-2s. He claims the scheme is needed to ensure youngsters from the 40 per cent least wealthy homes dod not fall behind before they even get to primary school. Overall, UK young people aged between . 15 and 29 expected to spend 2.3 years on average either unemployed or . out of the labour force entirely, OECD figures for 2011 revealed today. This . is higher than in many other countries including the Netherlands (1.1 . years), Iceland (1.2 years), Norway (1.3 years), Australia (1.7 years) and Germany (1.7 years). Many . young people will be out of the job market because they have 'given up, . more or less', according to Andreas Schleicher, the OECD’s deputy . director for education and skills. He . warned that the 'biggest challenge' to the UK at this time is to help . those youngsters who do not have decent qualifications and struggle to . find work. The coalition . parties have clashed over the protection given to universal pensioner . benefits, such as the winter fuel allowance and free TV licences and bus . passes. Tin ear: Mr Clegg (right) accused David Cameron's Conservatives of being 'callous' in wanting to slash welfare . David Cameron promised before the election that he would not cut them, but Mr Clegg has refused to sanction further cuts to working age benefits unless handouts for the over-65s are looked at. ‘The idea — and even the Labour Party is now coming round to this view — that you can just say you’re never going to look at that £200bn in the round seems to me to be unrealistic. He said that the promise not to cut them only covered this parliament until he 2015 election, whereas the spending review period lasts from April 2015 to March 2016. ‘I have been quite outspoken in saying that we can’t just take this off the table. ‘My own view is sometimes that the Conservatives have sometimes got a bit of a tin ear on this. The public want welfare reform, but they want it for the right motives. ‘I don’t actually think that the public, and certainly the people we are in politics to serve, I don’t think they like it if they feel that there is a note of retribution or callousness in our approach to welfare reform. ‘And that’s why I always think it’s very important to demonstrate that welfare reform has a purpose, particularly related to getting people into work.’","Deputy PM slams 'hotchpotch' of government projects failing to help young .

One of the West Virginia teenagers accused of fatally stabbing 16-year-old Skylar Neese (seen in held photograph) was like a second daughter to Dave and Mary Neese (pictured) Only if and when she is charged as an adult in the slaying of Skylar Neese will the suspect's identity be publicly revealed. But Skylar's parents know who she is. Or at least they thought they did. 'She walked in the door when she came here. She didn't even knock. She was like our daughter,' Dave Neese said. 'And not to know someone is more scary than knowing them, because now you know what they're capable of.' Authorities . say the unidentified juvenile and a second girl, 16-year-old Rachel . Shoaf, plotted to lure Skylar out of her family's apartment and kill her . last July 6. Most likely, Skylar's mother says, the University High School honors student just thought she was going for a joyride. 'One after another, just lie, lie, lie,' Mary Neese said this week in her first extensive interview since the slaying. 'Did . the same thing to the police. That's how the police got onto them, . because they would forget what they told them at one point and tell them . another, totally different story.' Gone: Skylar Neese disappeared in July 2012 and . was initially thought to be a runaway but her parents soon suspected she . had been abducted . Investigators . say Shoaf and the other girl drove Skylar to a remote spot on a gravel . road where the lush woods become Greene County, Pa., just across a . bridge and over the railroad tracks from the unincorporated West . Virginia community of Macdale. The . girls chatted for a while, according to testimony at Shoaf's plea . hearing on a second-degree murder charge. Then, at an agreed-upon . moment, they stabbed her. 'What . was going through my baby's head?' Dave Neese wonders. 'I can't imagine . what she was thinking the night this happened. Why? You know? Same . thing everybody else is asking. Why? Why would you kill me? 'This is a girl that's 16 years old, that loves her friends to death. Would do anything in the world for them,' he said. 'And they turn on her and count down — 3, 2, 1 — and stab her? I mean, what kind of sickness is that?' Shoaf's identity was revealed May 1 when prosecutors transferred her case to adult court and accepted her guilty plea. Authorities have said nothing about Shoaf or her unidentified co-defendant since. Friends: Rachel Shoaf (on the right in both pictures) has confessed to stabbing Skylar Neese (left) to death last summer . Tragic: Police chased numerous leads in trying to find Neese with no luck. Until Shoaf came forward . The . Neeses, however, say they expect her name to be made public soon, . possibly after Shoaf's as-yet unscheduled sentencing hearing. Shoaf told police the girls tried to bury the body, but hid it under some tree limbs when they couldn't. And there it lay for seven months. When . the Neeses couldn't find their daughter the morning of July 7, they . didn't worry. They called the unidentified suspect. No, she told them. Haven't seen her in a few days. In . hindsight, it was odd. They'd been friends half their lives but became . even tighter when the suspect moved from her home in the country to a . closer one in town, Mary Neese said. 'They were inseparable at that point. Either she was at our house or Skylar was at her house,' Mary Neese said. Charged: Rachel Shoaf, of Morgantown, pleaded guilty to the second-degree murder of Skylar Neese and she awaits sentencing in a juvenile detention center . They started hanging around with Shoaf, and Skylar's other friends quietly dropped out of the picture. Then the trouble began, her mother said, 'one mess after another.' Their . antics were fairly typical teenage behavior, she said — skipping class, . joyriding with boys, breaking Star City's 11 p.m. curfew — until they . got hauled home by police at 2 a.m. after breaking the speed limit. 'Luckily, . there was no alcohol, no drugs, nothing like that,' Mary Neese said. 'They were just riding around. But still, you're not supposed to do . that.' Later, the Neeses discovered Skylar had been slipping out her first-floor bedroom window and dropping a few feet to the ground. 'We . thought they had learned their lesson,' Mary Neese said. 'She was like, . 'I understand, Mom. I understand.' She was in tears — not for herself . but for the other girls being in trouble. So we thought they had learned . their lesson. But they hadn't. Which we found out after.' It . took until 4 p.m. on the day after the killing for panic to set in. That's when the Wendy's where Skylar worked called to say she hadn't . shown up for a shift. The Neeses called police. The . next day, the longtime friend came to the apartment. She went door to . door with Mary Neese, asking if people had seen Skylar. Mary Neese had no reason to think she was anything but concerned. Mystery: People in the small West Virginia town had wondered for months about Skylar Neese. She vanished after slipping out the bedroom of her Star City home in July 2012 . For . months, police chased down tips that led nowhere. Even they didn't . initially suspect the girls. They might know more than they were saying, . police told the Neeses. Maybe they're protecting someone. Then . the stories started to conflict. Mary Neese defended the girls . 'countless times' as police tried to tell her what they suspected. 'I kept saying, 'No. You guys, they are having as hard a time with this as we are,'' she said. The . transcript from Shoaf's hearing shows the break came Jan. 3, when she . finally told investigators the truth — and where to find the body. What they still don't know is why. Shoaf told police the girls just didn't want to be friends with Skylar anymore. Dave and Mary Neese just shake their heads. They know there's more to it than that. Mary Neese wants to look Shoaf in the eye and ask. With the other girl, she says, there's no point. But Shoaf is now awaiting sentencing at a detention center in Wheeling. Prosecutors . have indicated they'll recommend a 20-year prison sentence, though the . victim's parents hope the judge will disregard he plea agreement and . impose the 40 years allowed by law. Either way, they may never know why their daughter died. What . they do know is they want to share their story. They are working with . two local writers on a book to 'get parents to open their eyes, just . like we should have done,' Mary Neese said. The . couple tried to trust their daughter. Go out with your friends, they . said. Just call. Let us know where you are. Be home at a reasonable . hour. 'I tried to give her . her freedom, so we weren't on top of her all the time,' Mary Neese said. 'Now in hindsight, those parents who do that? More power to them. They . should be.'

Big Love actress Chloe Sevigny has sold her one-bedroom Manhattan apartment for $1.76 million to the entrepreneur couple  Halle Tecco and Jeffrey Hammerbacher. Sevigny has previously described the 1,250 square foot home, with working fireplaces, beams and a private garden as 'womblike' and said she drew inspiration for its decoration from her New England childhood. The new owners of the apartment, on 10th Street, made their fortune in technology. Moving on: Big Love actress Chloe Sevigny has sold her East Village apartment for $1.76 million . Ms Tecco founded digital health start . ups fund, Rock Health, and Mr Hammerbacher, who went to college with . Mark Zuckerberg, worked at Facebook before starting his software firm . Cloudera, the New York Post said. Sevigny had originally put the apartment, which has a small study and plenty of close space, on the market last year. However, the original deal fell through in July because of a death in the buyer's family, according to Business Insider. According to its listing by realtor . Corcoran: 'Upon entering this very special apartment through the gate, . one is instantly transported to a retreat in the country.' The brownstone has a private garden, casement windows and a working fireplace in the bedroom and living room. After . the actress bought the 1862 East Village apartment for $1.2 million in . 2005, she turned to designer David Cafiero, who owns New York antiques . store Cafiero Select, for help.

'He’s really inspired by the sea, and I grew up on the water. I was like, ""Ahhh. I wish I could just live in his store!"".' The apartment was redesigned with bold print wallpaper, refurbished antiques, and a sprinkling of nautical themed items. The exposed brick walls were plastered over to accommodate the actress's art collection, and the plaster was painted in pale pinks, blues and yellows. Its design was featured in a 2007 edition of Home and Garden and in the 2009 edition of Apartamento. Sevigny, who grew up in Darien, Connecticut, said the wide planks used for floorboards, and low ceilings made her fall in love with the apartment. 'I walked in and felt transported, like I wasn’t in Manhattan anymore,' she said. Sweet dreams: The spacious bedroom has a working fireplace and wide floor boards . Bold: The actress turned to designer David Cafiero to redesign her apartment when she moved there in 2005 .

Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak has branded Edward Snowden a hero who acted 'from his heart' - even though the NSA whistleblower himself once said that such leakers should be shot. Wozniak expressed his distress that the technology he built with Steve Jobs in the 1970s is now being used to spy on people's emails and personal information. 'I think . Edward Snowden is a hero because this came from his heart,' Wozniak said of Snowden, who leaked details of an NSA program - Prism - that tracks emails and personal details. 'And I really . believe he was giving up his whole life because he just felt so deeply . about honesty, about spying on Americans, and he wanted to tell us.' Support: Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak has praised the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden for giving up his life to leak files revealing spying programs run by the U.S. government . The Apple co-founder spoke with the Daily Beast after appearing at a conference in Michigan. 'He's a hero to my beliefs about how the . Constitution should work,' he added. 'I don't think the NSA has done one thing . valuable for us, in this whole ""Prism"" regard, that couldn’t have been . done by following the Constitution and doing it the old way.' This need to share the government's dealings is not a belief that Snowden has always had, however. As Wozniak shows his support for . Snowden, it has emerged that four years ago the whistleblower posted on . an online forum expressing his anger at newspapers for printing . government secrets. 'Those people should be shot in the balls,' Snowden said of those who leak information to the public in a January 2009 online chat. Changing views: Snowden apparently posted online that he thought leakers should 'be shot in the balls' Snowden made the comments on an Internet Relay Chat server associated with Ars Technica, a technology forum, the Washington Post reported. He sent the messages under the screen name TheTrueHOOHA; numerous other posts reveal biographical details that identify the writer as Snowden, the Post reported. His messages came after a New York Times article detailed secret negotiations between the U.S. and Israel over how to deal with Iran's suspected nuclear program. 'Are they TRYING to start a war? Jesus christ. They're like wikileaks.' Snowden wrote. 'You don't put that s*** in the NEWSPAPER.' He added that he valued 'ethical reporting' but 'VIOLATING NATIONAL SECURITY? no. That s*** is classified for a reason. It's not because ""oh we hope our citizens don’t find out"". It’s because ""this s*** won’t work if iran knows what we’re doing"". I am so angry right now. This is completely unbelievable.' Hideout: He is currently in the transit area of Sheremetievo airport in Moscow after flying from Hong Kong . Snowden, who is charged with violating American espionage laws, fled his home in Hawaii for Hong Kong in May. On Sunday, after weeks in hiding, he flew to Russia. Russia only acknowledged his arrival only on Tuesday, when President Vladimir Putin said Snowden was still in the transit zone of Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov confirmed that he remained there on Wednesday. Snowden had also booked a seat on a Havana-bound flight on Monday en route to Venezuela and then possible asylum in Ecuador, but he failed to board the plane. Despite U.S. officials called for Snowden to be extradited immediately, but Russia said it would not as they have no extradition treaty with the country and Snowden has not committed a crime in Russia.

Search crews have uncovered the body of one of two Utah women missing after a terrifying boat crash last week. Sandy resident Valerie Rae Bradshaw, 29, was found lifeless just after 7 p.m. on Sunday about 340 feet underwater in Lake Powell, a popular recreational lake on the border of Utah and Arizona. Kane County deputies have been searching for days for Bradshaw and her boyfriend's sister, Jessica Jackman, 22, who remains missing after the deadly collision last Thursday morning. Tragic: The body of Valerie Rae Bradshaw, 29, pictured, was found just after 7 p.m. on Sunday in about 340 feet of water of Lake Powell . The women were on a family vacation at the lake and had been looking forward to the break for months. But the happy occasion turned to terror when the speedboat crashed into a houseboat near Dangling Rope Marina. Miss Jackman's father, Adrian Jackman, of South Jordan, . was driving the boat. The 59-year-old apparently tried to swerve when he noticed the moving houseboat ahead of him but hit . the front corner, authorities said. The motorboat flipped, killing his 57-year-old wife, Marilyn Jackman, on impact and flinging the other passengers into the water. Deputies were set to resume their search today in the hope of finding Miss Jackman in the same area. Mr Jackman was apparently distracted by his young passengers when he hit the houseboat and flipped the craft. Gone: The speedboat driver's daughter, Jessica Jackman (left), 22, and his son's girlfriend, Valerie Rae Bradshaw (right), 29, of Sandy, Utah, were missing in the water. Miss Jackman has still not been found . Family horror: Marilyn Jackman (left), 57, was killed when her husband, Adrian (right), crashed the powerboat he was driving . The accident that happened at around 8 a.m. Miss Bradshaw was the girlfriend of Mr and Mrs Jackman's son. Crews began searching the deep water . on Friday using a robot equipped with a camera. But they ran into . technical problems and had to call off the effort, according to Denise . Shultz, spokeswoman for the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area that . encompasses Lake Powell. The Utah Highway Patrol was asked to bring in equipment from the Salt Lake City area, and the search resumed on Saturday and continued into Sunday. Most of the people aboard the motorboat were family members from northern Utah, deputies said. Nobody on the houseboat was injured. Aftermath: The motorboat, which was carrying 13 passengers, slammed into a houseboat and flipped over last Thursday . Search: Divers are still looking for Miss Jackman who was thrown from a boat that crashed in Dangling Rope Marina, pictured . It's not uncommon for boaters to venture . out early in the morning while the waters of Lake Powell are smooth, . said Kane County sheriff's Sgt. Alan Alldredge. The vast man-made lake, bordered . by sandstone walls and colorful rock formations, is a popular . destination for houseboat vacations. Deputies . said the group was headed to Rainbow Bridge — touted as the largest . known natural bridge in the world — when the crash happened. Crews had . to rescue some victims from the water, Shultz said. All . of the six children aboard were wearing life jackets, officials said. Mr Jackman and his 11-year-old granddaughter were airlifted to a . hospital in Flagstaff, Arizona, while a third person was taken to the . hospital by ambulance. Big dreams: Family friends say Jessica Jackman (far left) aspired to be Miss America and a social worker when she grew up . Keeping the faith: Jessica Jackman grew up in the Mormon Church, and her father serves as a local bishop for the Latter Day Saints church . The Jackmans' family and friends in the town of South Jordan were left reeling from the news of the tragedy. 'It's been pretty hard to take,' neighbor Rick Wahlquist told the station KSL. 'And I know there's a lot of people that are really just struggling and . in shock over the whole thing. Marilyn is a saint and would do anything . for anybody at anytime.' Adrian . Jackman serves as the bishop of the Later Day Saints Church's Parkway . 1st Ward in South Jordan. Friends say the whole family are avid boaters . and vacationed on Lake Powell often. Mr Wahlquist, who lived near the . Jackmans for 20 years, said as a young girl, Jessica wanted to be a wife . and Miss America when she grew up. she also aspired to become a social . worker. Life of the party: Valerie Rae Bradshaw (right) was described by those who knew her as an outgoing and fun-loving young woman . Getaway gone awry: Valerie's roommates said the 29-year-old loved spending time on Lake Powell and had been looking forward to her vacation with the Jackmans for months . 'Just a great young woman,' Wahlquist said. 'And what a tragedy to see this happen.' Miss Bradshaw's friends said she was extremely outgoing and loved having fun. 'She will be so missed because when . she enters the room, it becomes full,' said roommate Aloyse Robertson. 'It becomes bright. And we love her.' Friend . Auri Root said Miss Bradshaw had been looking forward to the Lake Powell trip . for weeks and months. She leaves behind a twin sister. Vacation: Lake Powell, where the powerboat carrying 13 people flipped over, is a popular destination for boating holidays . The . crash happened in a channel a couple of hundred yards wide in Lake . Powell. Police believe Mr Jackman may have looked away from where he was . headed after a child moved from the front to the back of the boat, KSL said. Mr Alldredge said that as someone yelled 'Boat' the driver looked up to see a houseboat in their path. As he tried to swerve, Mr Jackman clipped the houseboat with enough force to throw his 12 passengers overboard. The water in Lake Powell is about 400ft deep at the crash site, according to Center Daily News. 'This time of year, the lake can get busy and these kinds of accidents, even though they're not rare, they do have a great potential for happening out there,' Mr Alldredge said.","Valerie Rae Bradshaw was found just after 7 p.m. on Sunday after three days of searching .

"By . Lydia Warren . PUBLISHED: . 07:46 EST, 25 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:39 EST, 25 June 2013 . Killer: Marshall Lee Gore, 49, has been granted a last minute stay of execution in Miami . A murderer on Death Row in Florida has been granted a stay of execution just one hour before he was supposed to receive a lethal injection - after his lawyers claimed he is insane. Marshall Lee Gore, 49, a former escort service owner who strangled and stabbed exotic dancer Robyn Novick to death in 1988, was supposed to be put to death in Miami at 6pm on Monday. He has also been convicted of a second murder. But a federal appeals court temporarily halted the execution at the last minute and a court date has been set for Thursday for his lawyers to explore the possibility that he is insane. The stay came after Gore enjoyed his . 'last' meal of a rib-eye steak and a Coca-Cola. He did not touch his . side of a baked potato, the Miami Herald reported. The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, which is based in Atlanta, said it would try to settle the matter before July 1, the newspaper added. Gore's attorneys have previously argued that he is mentally ill, and one lawyer claimed he was 'mentally deranged' and not responsible for his actions. During his trials, he had frequent verbal outbursts, laughed out loud and even howled. He has also contended that the date of his scheduled execution, June 24, 2013, adds up to 666 and that he is a target of 'Satan Worshippers who have threatened that date by mail for years'. But Gore has no significant history of mental illness and last month a panel of psychiatrists found that he was mentally sound. Death Row: He was supposed to die by lethal injection in the death chamber at Florida State Prison, pictured, but a court of appeals granted him a temporary stay as his lawyers said he is insane . They said that Gore claimed that the 'Illuminati' wanted him dead to sell his organs - a story they say he made up to manipulate the judicial process. 'This fantastic, imaginative scenario was patently a fabrication designed . to mislead the panel and avoid responsibility for his past actions,' the panel told the governor. Relatives of Novick, who had traveled from Ohio to witness the execution, were devastated, the Herald reported. The family of Susan Marie Roark, another of Gore's victims, was also present. 'They're upset,' said retired Lt. Neal Nydam, who was with the Roark family. 'This has been going on for 25 years. They're trying to find closure and it's not going to happen today.' Gore first kidnapped a stripper named Tina in March 1988, raped her, slit her throat and hit her across the head with a rock before leaving her to die in a rural area. But she survived and managed to alert police. Gore had also stolen her car - and her two-year-old son in the back seat. He was later found alive locked in a cabinet of an abandoned home in Georgia. While officers were searching for the boy, they found Novick's body. The 30-year-old had met Gore while working as a dancer in North Miami-Dade. Crimes: He killed two women in 1988 and raped another before kidnapping her two-year-old son . Gore was tracked down to Kentucky. When he was found, he had Tina's woman's bank and credit cards in his jacket pocket, according to court documents. Police also identified him as the person . who killed Roark. She had last been seen with Gore before vanishing in . April 1988. Her body was found off a rural forest road. Upon questioning about all three crimes and shown pictures of Novick's body, police said his eyes filled with tears and he said: 'If I did this, I deserve the death penalty.' Gore initially denied knowing any of the women, according to police. But he later testified that all three women worked for him at his escort service. In 1995, he was found guilty of Novick's murder and sent to Death Row. Gov. Scott signed the death warrant last month. His death would have been the state's third execution of the month.","Former escort service owner Marshall Lee Gore, 49, killed two women in 1988 and kidnapped, raped and stabbed another .

Yasmin Prest: 'Case wouldn't have been necessary if Michael had been fair' A British oil tycoon lost his landmark divorce battle against his ex-wife in the Supreme Court yesterday and was ordered to pay her £17.5million. Michael Prest, 50, one of Britain’s most successful black businessmen, argued that he could not pay his former wife as his assets were owned by his companies, not by him. But the court ruled that property worth £11million was held ‘in trust’ for him by companies he controlled and owned and ordered their transfer to Yasmin Prest, 49. Yesterday’s ruling sets a precedent because it reverses a previous judgment that had barred Mrs Prest from obtaining the properties as they were separate legal entities under corporate law. That decision had raised the prospect of wealthy husbands being able to ‘bury’ their assets in companies they own to protect them from generous divorce settlements. The Prests, who have four children, have spent almost £3million in legal fees contesting the divorce settlement following the break-up of their 15-year marriage in 2008. The Supreme Court heard that the couple were based in London but also had properties in Nigeria and the Caribbean and lived to a ‘very high standard’. Mrs Prest had been seeking a payout of more than £30million, plus more than £730,000 a year to meet the ‘reasonable needs’ of her and their children. Mr Prest, whose business was valued at £2.5billion in 2007, had offered her £27,000 a year and a lump sum of less than £2million. In 2011, the High Court ordered that Mr Prest should transfer a £4million property in London to his wife and make a lump sum payment of £17.5million. He was told to transfer seven UK properties owned by his company, and worth £11.3million, to his wife to partially meet the lump sum payment. The tycoon was also told to pay maintenance of £24,000 a year for each of his four children, along with school fees and medical bills. Multi-millionaire Michael Prest, 51, lost a lengthy legal battle over what he should pay his ex-wife Yasmin, 50 . His companies challenged the High Court . decision and won their case in the Appeal Court. But it led to Mrs Prest . taking the battle to the Supreme Court. The case revolved around the . question of whether courts had the power to treat assets owned by a . company as belonging to the person controlling the company. Marriage . law states that assets to which the ‘party is entitled, either in . possession or reversion’ can be transferred to a spouse in a divorce . settlement. The court concluded that the properties were held ‘on trust’ for Mr Prest by his companies and that the ‘particular circumstances’ of this case allowed them to order the transfer of  the assets. The . judges reflected on the High Court’s criticism of the businessman in . their ruling, saying he had failed to comply with court orders ‘with . particular regard to disclosing evidence’. The Maida Vale home of multi-millionaire businessman Michael Prest who tried to keep his fortune from wife . They said: ‘The court . inferred that the reason for the companies’ failure to co-operate was to . protect the properties, which suggested that proper disclosure would . reveal them to [be] beneficially owned by the husband.’ It found . that Mr Prest had employed ‘obstruction, obfuscation and deceit’. Mrs . Prest, who still uses her married name, looked visibly relieved as the . judgment was read out yesterday and said it was ‘more a case of . satisfaction’ than celebration. ‘None of this would have been necessary . if Michael had been sensible and played fair,’ she said. Lawyers said that today's decision would have far-reaching implications for couples divorcing in the future . Her lawyer, . Jeremy Posnansky QC, said: ‘The Supreme Court’s decision will ensure . that dishonest husbands can’t cheat their wives and flout court orders . by hiding behind a web of deceit and a corporate façade.’ Mr Prest . did not attend. His lawyer, Martin Pointer QC, argued that the . companies’ assets were ‘held in trust’ for his children and those of his . siblings under Nigerian law. He argued that a £10,000 bequest from . his Nigerian father after he died in 1992 was the ‘seed money’ that . built his oil empire and his brother has begun a separate claim. Several . of Mr Prest’s companies are also appealing against the divorce payout. Lawyers said today's ruling would have important implications for divorcing couples in future . Lawyers today spoke of the far-reaching impact of today's Supreme Court ruling. Tom Farley-Hills, family partner at London law firm Harbottle & Lewis, said: 'If the Court of Appeal decision created a ""Cheat's charter"" by allowing someone to hide their assets behind the corporate veil, this ruling has ripped it up. 'It says husbands who use company structures for dishonest purposes will come unstuck. 'It also says that even when husbands have assets held within a company but who are not trying to circumvent claims by their spouses dishonestly – the nature of those assets and how they became corporate assets will be looked at closely by the courts to establish true ownership... 'It should allow spouses where their spouse has put assets used by the family into a structure to sleep a little more easily.' Alison Hawes, a specialist family lawyer at law firm Irwin Mitchell, said the ruling was a 'landmark'. She said: 'The ruling confirms that, if someone is the sole owner of a company, then if the court is satisfied that those assets are held by that company on trust for one party, they can be used as part of a divorce. 'It means that business people cannot deliberately ""hide"" their assets in businesses and corporate structures to protect them in future in the event of a divorce.' Michael Hutchinson, a partner at law firm Mayer Brown, said: 'The Supreme Court has handed down a landmark decision in which, for the first time since at least the end of the19th century, it has accepted a general exception to the rule against 'piercing the corporate veil'. 'This is an extraordinary decision and the implications for corporate governance are potentially huge. 'Businesses and lawyers will be poring over the judgment for some time to try to understand its limits.' Marilyn Stowe, a senior partner at Stowe Family Law, went on: 'The Supreme Court's decision is a victory for common sense.'","Michael Prest, 51, lost his Supreme Court fight against ex-wife Yasmin, 50 .

The house where Gianni Versace was killed has had its asking price cut by $50million after failing to find a buyer for more than a year. However, the luxurious Miami mansion is still set to remain the preserve of the super-wealthy, as its buyer will have to cough up $75million. The extravagant 10-bedroom home, known as 'Casa Casuarina', is being sold by its current owner, telecoms magnate Peter Loftin. Scroll down for video . Opulence: Gianni Versace's old home in South Beach, known by most as Casa Casuarina though now a hotel owned by Peter Loftin, has been listed for $75million . Design marvel: Though the designer behind Villa by Barton G, refurbished the 23,000 square foot space, the style is very much in keeping with the lavish tastes of its former owner . Palatial: Peter Loftin, a telecom entrepreneur, bought the mansion in 2000 and resided there before its conversion into a boutique hotel in 2009 . He initially asked $125million for . the property, making it the most expensive house on the market when it . was first put up for sale a year ago. But in November he was forced to take $25million off the asking price, and has now lowered it by another $25million. Mr . Loftin bought the luxury mansion in 2000, three years after Versace's . murder, and converted the residence into a boutique hotel and private . club in 2009. Bargain? The lavish house is now available for $50million less than it originally cost . Expansion: The home was totally remodelled by Versace himself after he fell in love with the property . Unique: There are not many homes as utterly lavish as the house where Versace lived until his death . Pool: But only an extravagant multi-millionaire could afford to buy the Miami Beach mansion . Dark past: It was outside this house where legendary designer Versace was killed by a lone gunman . Those who have toured the incredible . property maintain that the once gold-lined swimming pool and museum quality . frescoes are just a few of the lavish features that contribute to the . hefty price tag. In fact, such is its value, property experts refer to the luxurious villa as a 'trophy property'. The now legendary Italian designer . bought Casa Casuarina in 1992 for just under $10million after supposedly passing by and falling in love with it. Boutique: The Versace motif remains on the floor of one of the hotel suites, a tribute to the designer who spent $33million renovating and expanding the property after he bought it in 1992 . Prints and patterns: The villa was originally built in the 1930s by architect Alden Freeman as an homage to the oldest existing house in the western hemisphere in Santo Domingo . Lavish: The hotel still features the murals and frescoes painted on the walls and ceilings by Mr Versace, a detail that contributes to the hefty price tag . Ocean view: Villa by Barton G looks out onto the Atlantic from its Miami Beach location, an exclusive section of the South Beach strip . A step in the wrong direction: Mr Versace was tragically killed at the entrance to Casa Casuarina in 1997 by Andrew Cunanan who committed suicide shortly after . Originally built in the 1930s by architect Alden Freeman, the Miami Beach property was somewhat dilapidated until Versace invested $33million into restoring and improving the property. Once an architect himself, the . flamboyant designer added a 6,100 square foot south wing and a 54ft pool . lined with 24-karat-gold. The impressive courtyard he covered in thousands upon thousands of individual mosaic tiles while elaborate . frescoes were painted across the property's walls and ceilings. Illuminating: A skylight brightens up the original interior designed by Gianni Versace in the famously ornate home that he bought in 1992 after falling in love with the property . Grandeur: The couturier added a 6,100 square foot south wing to the property and covered the courtyard in thousands upon thousands of individual mosaic tiles . Kids room? The property cost Mr Versace $10million and though he plugged $33million of his own money into its renovation, after his death his family made a quick sale for only $20million to its new owner . Residential palace: The one acre property featured ten bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, seven fireplaces, a garage for 12 cars and a guesthouse . Indeed it was Versace's pride . and joy until the fateful June day of 1997 when Andrew Cunanan . assassinated him in cold blood on the very steps of the house. Icon: Missed by the fashion world, the late Gianni Versace was once an architect . When Donatella Versace scrambled to sell . off the designer's assets, Mr Loftin gained from a quick bargain and . bought the villa for a cool $20million. After residing there himself for a . number of years, he turned the opulent property into a boutique hotel. The property is now known as Villa . by Barton G after the events impresario Barton G. Weiss who renovated and re-styled it . Nowadays, according to the hotel's website, the decor 'takes up style where fashion designer Gianni Versace left off.' Boasting 23,400sq feet, the ornate . house includes seven fireplaces, a guest house and a parking garage . large enough for a dozen cars, and all within a one acre plot. For the past three years hotel guests have enjoyed the surrounding attractions of Miami's historic Art Deco district while re-energising from the day poolside or in one of two of the residence's lounges. Coldwell Banker's Jill Eber and Jill Hertzberg, known to many as 'The Jills' are representing Mr. Loftin in the sale.

Pensioners who sold their homes in hope of a dream retirement have today told an inquiry how their hopes were shattered after learning they had actually been sold part time holiday homes. Residents of the Lakeminster Park development, near Beverley, East Yorkshire, said they were 'blissfully unaware' when they sold their old homes that they were actually moving into holiday accommodation rather than permanent residences. A council has rejected retrospective planning permission for them to be used as full-time houses leaving them with the prospect of being evicted. Lakeminster Park, in Beverley, where pensioners who have paid £130,00 for their homes face eviction. From left Alan and Hilary Coates, Dave and Pam Foulstone and Eric and Connie Wrighton . A fraud investigation is running at the same time as the planning inquiry. Four people have been arrested as part of the alleged fraudulent selling of the homes. More than 100 pensioners in 78 homes are affected. They include sufferers of lung cancer, Parkinson’s disease, arthritis, diabetes, and other crippling ailments who need homes with easy access, and had given up their jobs looking forward to a mortgage-free life away from city estates. The planning inquiry is currently under way to decide whether East Riding Council was right to refuse them retrospective planning permission. Dave Foulstone, 61, and his wife sold their bungalow to buy their £140,000 park home on the site. Mr Foulstone said: 'We found out to our dismay we had purchased a holiday home  - not a permanent home. 'We were in a complete state of shock. We would be devastated if we had to leave the site and do not have the money to purchase another property.' Residents at the park were 'blissfully unaware' when they sold their old homes that they were actually moving into holiday accommodation rather than permanent residences . A council rejected retrospective planning permission for them to be used as full-time houses leaving them with the prospect of being evicted . Residents say they sold up and bought the properties as full-time homes, but were then told the park homes are only for holiday use and they must have another permanent address. Retired civil servant Alan Coates was one of the first to move onto the park, and had been 'blissfully unaware' anything was wrong after selling his bungalow. He is one of the guiding lights of an appeal against East Riding Council’s refusal to grant the consent for permanent homes on the site. He and his frail wife had been living there more than two years before council bosses wrote to them to say there was a planning problem. He told the inquiry: 'I can’t see we are doing much harm. 'We live in a nice community and pay our taxes. I can’t understand the council’s view for us to have to leave.' Barrister Ruth Stockley, representing Mr Coates, told the first day of the inquiry that the outcome would affect every person living there. In her opening statement, Miss Stockley said: 'The dismissal of this appeal will result in all the residents of this site losing their homes. Residents say they sold up and bought the properties as full-time homes, but were then told the park homes are only for holiday use and they must have another permanent address . 'They’ll be made homeless and you will hear about the difficulties they will face.' Barrister Nicola Allan, representing East Riding Council, said: 'The establishment of a retirement park home village in the open countryside would set a precedent that would inevitably encourage breaches elsewhere. 'This is particularly the case in this council’s area, which has a substantial number of caravans in holiday use. The council maintains this is a flagrant breach of planning control and the development is contrary to the development plan.' Those arrested as part of the fraud inquiry include a solicitor of 40 years, a 50-year-old man, a 52-year-old woman, and a 31-year-old woman from Beverley. A 47-year-old woman was arrested in relation to money laundering allegations linked to Lakeminster.The inquiry is expected to last another fortnight.

A man knocked down his £500,000 former home in less than an hour because he faced eviction, a court has heard. Christopher McGowan, 50, allegedly used a hired JCB to demolish the rear ground floor wall of Silver Bow Farm in Greenbottom, near Truro, Cornwall. His actions left the property structurally unsound after prosecutors claim he smashed through doors, kitchen and bathroom units. A jury heard that when McGowan went on the wrecking spree he also removed all the fixtures and fittings from the house. Christopher McGowan is accused of demolishing a wall at the back of his former home making the building structurally unsound . During his alleged wrecking spree McGowan also removed all the fixtures and fittings from the house . From the front the house looks okay, but it is a wreck after McGowan allegedly became angry when a million-pound property deal fell through . It is alleged that he wanted ‘to punish’ the new owners of the house after a million-pound property deal went sour. Truro Crown Court was told that he had already been evicted from the house and land after it was sold to Janet Taylour for nearly half a million pounds. Philip Lee, prosecuting, said McGowan had been declared bankrupt in 2009 and was in negative equity with debts of more than £500,000. He was setting up a £1million deal with Wycliffe Estates, managed by Mrs Taylour’s son, Christopher Taylour but it fell through when he failed to disclose his bankruptcy. McGowan, pictured outside Truro Crown Court, has been accused of wrecking his £500,000 old house with a mechanical digger 'to punish' the new owners . It then emerged that he did not even hold the legal title to the property and was due to be evicted in September 2010. Mrs Taylour bought the property for £470,000 in February 2011 from McGowan’s mortgage lenders. He was allowed to remain living there but could not pay his rent and an appeal against the eviction order failed in July 2012. Mr Lee said the following month he hired the JCB from a nearby construction firm and returned it within an hour. He told the court: 'On August 16 he hired a digger and returned it within 40 minutes. The nature and extent of the damage is such that it can only have been done deliberately. 'The defendant has the motive and the . inclination to punish the Taylours. He must have been responsible for . the damage. There is no other reasonable explanation.' Mr Lee added: 'It’s the Crown’s case . that by then the defendant was in an angry and desperate state of mind . as a result of being unable to meet his mortgage. 'The defendant had hopes of making a . significant financial gain but in the end he was not in a position to . sell the property. He was not in a position to negotiate any deals.' The court heard that Mr Taylour went to the house later the same day and found extensive damage. Mr Lee said: 'The rear ground floor wall had been destroyed rendering the property structurally unsound.' The . jury were handed photographs of the scene showing that doors, kitchen . and bathroom units and fixtures and fittings had all been removed. McGowan, . of Chacewater, Cornwall, denies two counts of causing criminal damage. The jury had heard he has admitted fraud and forgery connected to the . case. The case continues.

At times it feels as if we know the homes in television shows better than our own, but for some an affinity with fictional living spaces extends far beyond the TV screen. In fact, an estimated 4.6 million UK homeowners are so obsessed with interiors seen in sitcoms and dramas that they've spent thousands of pounds filling their own homes with identical furniture and interior design features, according to a survey. Taking in everything from the apartments in Friends, to the 60s design masterpieces of Mad Men and even the 'reality' homes of TOWIE, the research sought to discover just how influential iconic on-screen living spaces are on our own interiors. Get the look: An estimated 4.6 million UK homeowners have been so taken with living spaces in sitcoms and dramas that they've spent thousands of pounds filling their own homes with identical furniture and features . For almost one third (31 per cent) of homeowners surveyed, such shows are a treasure trove of inspiration, with respondents spending an average of £3,836 each to make their humble abodes look like they belong on the TV - over £3.5 million in total. In terms of the TV home that's held in the highest regard, nothing comes close to Carrie Bradshaw's aspirational apartment from Sex & The City. While the American comedy-drama may have left screens almost a decade ago, in the style and interior design stakes it has truly stood the test of time. Inspired homeowners spend a total of over £530,000 replicating the famous walk-in wardrobe (45 per cent), floor-to-ceiling bookcases (38 per cent), and flowing white curtains (30 per cent) seen in Carrie's chic Manhattan pad - more than any other on-screen living space. The Carrie effect: In terms of the TV home that's held in the highest regard, nothing comes close to Carrie Bradshaw's aspirational apartment from Sex & The City . Although Carrie's flat is deemed the most inspirational on-screen home it's the Norcross home in TOWIE which is the most expensive to replicate. Homeowners spend an average £3,016 each to kit out their home with the Aga range cooker, framed plasma TV, chandeliers and pool table. The same can't be said for Del and Rodney’s Peckham pad from Only Fools & Horses, which, despite a recent revival in 70s furniture, has not inspired its fans, coming bottom of the inspirational TV shows table. The Only Way Is Expense: It's the Norcross home in TOWIE that's most expensive to replicate, with homeowners spending £3,016 to kit out their home with range cookers, plasma TVs and pool tables . The dream TV sitcom apartment: This is an artist's impression of the ideal apartment based on the nation's favourite interiors from sitcoms . Looking across the country, homeowners in the West Midlands (35 per cent), London (34 per cent), and the North East (33 per cent) are the most likely to turn to the living spaces of TV shows to inspire their own abodes. Matthew Poll, of MORE TH>N Home Insurance, who carried out the research, said: 'There are countless TV programmes, magazines and books dedicated to inspiring interior design; however, it’s fascinating to see just how many homeowners are turning to sitcoms, dramas and even the likes of TOWIE as a source of inspiration for their own homes. 'Given how much time we invest in TV shows it’s perhaps not surprising that those same living spaces leave an indelible impression on homeowners and some clearly come at a significant cost.

Seven decades on, the ancient system of caves is providing a  makeshift home to desperate migrants from Eastern Europe. Attracted to Britain for a better life, they are living in squalor 20ft up a thickly wooded cliff above the River Mersey in Stockport. Squalid: An Estonian huddles up in a cave near Stockport that is strewn with rubbish and filth. For him it is home . Safe: Despite the filthy conditions in the cave, it is much more secure and comfortable than the street . Their plight underlines the growing . lengths to which Eastern Europeans will go in order to stay in the . country, which critics say will worsen when curbs on migration are . lifted for Romanians and Bulgarians next year. One of the cave-dwellers was an Estonian man who identified himself only as ‘KP’. He would only say, ‘It is not good’ in broken English as he rooted through rubbish barely a stone’s throw from the M60 motorway. Estonians, along with Poles and .

Audrey Sells came up with the idea of moving into the mobile home so she could be closer to daughter Tina Sanders who helps care for her . A family who created a makeshift annexe by putting a 26ft mobile home on the side of their house have been ordered to move it by planners. Grandmother Audrey Sells, 69, came  up with the cut-price idea after deciding  she needed to be closer to her married daughter, Tina Sanders, who helps to care for her. Instead of moving into the three-bedroom semi where Mrs Sanders lives with her  family, or building an extension, they paid £4,000 for the static caravan which now fills up the entire yard. The mobile home – which did not have planning permission – was installed last month. It has double glazing, mains  electricity and drainage, but there is no direct access to the house. Neighbours in Deal, Kent, are furious and say it makes their street look like a  travellers’ site. Planning officers at Dover District Council have now ruled that the ‘dominant and incongruous’ caravan adversely affects the character of the area and has to go. Mrs Sanders, 48, who lives with her husband  and two children, says her mother will now have to move into her £140,000 house  with them. She said: ‘They told us it doesn’t fit in  with the environment. My mum is going  to have to sell it and we will have her  stay with us. We’ve been having a difficult time. We all need to be together. ‘I didn’t realise it was going to  cause so much upset, otherwise I wouldn’t have done it.‘We’ve tried to do everything properly.  We feel like we are being persecuted for  trying to help my mum out.’ The mobile home comes complete with mains electricity and sewage drains . Neighbours had posted angry comments about the caravan on the council’s website. Anita Hubbard wrote: ‘I appreciate . that the applicant cannot afford an extension. However, that does not . mean that they  can simply erect a substantial home in  their garden. ‘The static caravan is the type found in a holiday park or travellers’ community and doesn’t belong in a residential area.’ Fellow resident Karen Austin Ackland added: ‘It makes the whole street feel like we are living on a gipsy site.’ Another neighbour, Jonathan Goodsell, has been a vocal critic of the extension, demanding its immediate removal. He posted on the council’s website . that the caravan has had ‘a profound effect on the neighbourhood,’ lowering the tone of the area and reducing house values. Instead of moving into Tina's three-bedroom semi they paid £4,000 for the static caravan . Mrs Sells suffers from severe eczema and amnesia which she says leave her in need of constant care. Her daughter refused to let her move into emergency accommodation. Mrs Sanders said that as well as . paying £4,000 for the caravan, they spent a  further £3,000 having the . double glazing installed. The family said that the total cost was still much less than the £28,000 they were quoted for an extension. Members of the council’s planning executive voted to remove the caravan during a meeting on June 6. It is not the first case of its kind. In January property developer Alan Beesley, 41, was told  to tear down . his £500,000 home after disguising it as a barn on protected Green Belt . land near Potters Bar, Hertfordshire.","Audrey Sells, 69, came up with the idea to be closer to her daughter .

Sally Bercow has blundered into controversy again – by flogging antiques from her free home in Parliament. The furniture is her own, but photographs of it in her eBay advertisements were clearly taken in the grace and favour apartments provided for her husband John, Speaker of the House of Commons. And it appears that buyers of 43-year-old Mrs Bercow’s unwanted stuff were invited into the Houses of Parliament to pick up their purchases. Up for auction: Sally Bercow, the Speaker's wife, sold £1,600 of antiques in an eBay blitz just weeks before she was handed a £100,000 bill for libelling a Tory peer on Twitter . Ad: This two-seat sofa auctioned by Sally Bercow went for £480, and clearly shows the Commons carpets and grand fixtures. She also asked for collection in person from Westmister . Controversial: Sally Bercow with her Commons Speaker husband John, whose Parliament flat she was using as a backdrop for all the adverts . A spokesman for the House of Commons last . night made clear that none of the items sold by Mr and Mrs Bercow was . Parliament property, and insisted there were no security issues over . buyers being invited into the Commons. But keen observers of the misadventures of Mrs Bercow – nicknamed ‘Silly Sally’ by her many critics – will be curious about her motives for suddenly selling ten pieces of furniture at cut prices to raise more than £1,600 in a two-week auction frenzy. She is certainly in need of ready cash. Last month she disastrously lost a libel claim brought against her by Tory peer Lord McAlpine, after she sent a tweet to her 56,000 followers falsely implying he was a paedophile. Although she could have admitted she was at fault, she fought the case and lost, ending up with a bill for damages and costs thought to total more than £100,000. And even her 50-year-old husband, with generous £142,000-a-year pay, plus expenses, and without the need to pay for a family home, will struggle to cover that. The controversial £45,000 taxpayer- funded refurbishment of their apartment at the Houses of Parliament four years ago may also mean that some of their own furniture had become redundant. Mrs Bercow has been a fanatical user of eBay for years – to a similar extent to fellow political wife and keen bargain hunter Cherie Blair. Those she has bought from and sold to offer almost universal praise in Miss Bercow’s eBay ratings – although in March a seller offering a Heals light for £70 caustically said of her: ‘Fails to contact or complete sale. Unreliable, Rude and pompous in her messaging! The antique furnishings were put up for sale in April, shortly before she was hit with her libel bill. Feedback: One customer was very keen to buy some of the furniture up for sale, but was left unhappy with the contact he had with Mrs Bercow . eBay sale: Speaker's wife was selling items like this sofa on eBay weeks before she lost her high-profile libel case with Lord McAlpine, which will cost her £100,000 . Grand: The Bercows live in a grace-and-favour flat in Parliament but it is not clear if buyers were asked inside to see the items they were buying . Auctions: All these items (top left to bottom right)  were sold, including one piece she said was worth £2,250 but sold for £250 . Argument: The old oak items were auctioned by the Bercows because they would 'not work' in their new house . Mrs Bercow was so eager to sell that she let an 1890 oak dresser go for just £250 – despite claiming than an antiques dealer gave it a valuation of £2,250. Also sold for £480 was a Duresta Loafer sofa, clearly pictured beside a grand  fireplace in the Bercows’ Parliament residence. She said in her eBay advertisements: ‘I’m selling lots of quality antique and period-style furniture. Must be collected from central London, near Westminster Tube.’ And Mrs Bercow also made a clear reference to the £935,000 six-bed 1980s Thames-side townhouse in Battersea, south London, she and her husband bought in January. Mrs Bercow wrote that the: ‘Antique and period-style furniture just won’t work in the new, modern house we bought recently.’ The Bercows are understood to have planned to let their modern Battersea house for £5,000 a month – although Westminster-watchers believe Mr Bercow fears losing his prestigious Commons role after the 2015 General Election. His fellow Tories are believed to have scant regard for him. Ebay sellers have also told of how they have sold their own second-hand goods to Mrs Bercow, commenting that they were amazed to have her turn up at their homes in a rented van to collect her purchases. Problems: Lawyers for Tory peer Lord McAlpine . said he had suffered 'unnecessary pain' as a result of the court case . while Mrs Bercow said the litigation had been a 'nightmare' - but she lost . Couple: Mrs Bercow is able to live in the Commons thanks to her husband John's job as Commons Speaker . She has spent more than £4,000 on eBay since February. One surprised seller said: ‘It was a bit surreal to have the Speaker’s wife standing in my hallway.’  Last night a spokesman for the Commons said: ‘The items sold by Mr and Mrs Bercow were their own belongings. ‘And there are no concerns about security, as all visitors to the Parliamentary estate, including those to the Bercows’ home in Speaker’s House, undergo strict search procedures as a condition of entry and are restricted as to where they may go on the estate.’ The Bercows had a £45,000 refurbishment of their Parliament apartment within weeks of arriving there in 2009, all at taxpayers’ expense.

It’s been a bit of a mad week for me – it was my 23rd birthday last week and I celebrated in style! While experimenting with different beauty looks before the big night, I found one I particularly love, taking inspiration from the metallic beauty looks that were all over the SS13 catwalks: Gold nails, gold on the eyes – even gold lips! I’ve taken my favourite elements of these looks to create the ultimate Grecian-style golden goddess look, featuring warm, shimmery skin and a dazzling gold eye. It’s great for a night out, and looks amazing against a bronzed bod. It’s also surprisingly easy to achieve – here’s how I did it. Golden girl: Binky loves gold nails, gold on the eyes - even gold lips and here she shows you how to get the look at home . To achieve the shimmery skin I wanted I used the Clarins Instant Light Complexion Perfector, which can be worn alone or under foundation. This product is loaded with shimmery pigments that really illuminate the skin and bring it to life, as well as adding some sheer coverage. I gently dabbed it to the skin and blended it in with my fingers; you don’t need too much of it, just a few squeezes of the pump are enough to provide a beautifully glowing base. How To Do Golden Makeup . The main attraction in this look is of course the glittering gold eye. To create this I used the bareMinerals High Shine Eye Colour in Bronze, packing the colour all the way over my eyelid as well as on my lower lash line. The eyeshadow is super-pigmented and creamy, it glides on like a dream! I then added some warmth to my glittering gold eyes by applying Guerlain’s Terracotta 4 Seasons Bronzing Powder to my socket lids. I did this with an angled brush, concentrating on the outer corners for a winged effect. The gorgeous bronze colour works really well against the gold. Don’t be scared to experiment with beauty products, make-up is all about having fun after all! Glitter eye: The main attraction in this look is of course the glittering gold eye and don't be scared to experiment . Next, to add some depth to my eyes, I applied the Daniel Sandler Waterproof Eyeliner on my upper and lower waterlines. This really makes the eyes pop. I then covered my lashes with Daniel Sandler Jumbo Jet Mascara, which both lengthens and volumises the lashes without making them clump together. You all know how much I love my bronzer, and this look is all about looking golden and gorgeous, so I decided to use another bronzing product – the Clarins Bronzing Duo – to sculpt my face. First, I swept the lighter shade in the palette under my cheekbones, across my temples and down the sides of my nose. This light shade contours the face and makes it look slimmer. I then moved on to the darker shade, which I applied across my cheekbones to really warm up my skintone. Shimmer girl: You don't have to stop at the face - you can accentuate your shoulders and décolletage with some shimmery body bronzer for that all-over golden goddess look . Finally, I applied the Daniel Sandler Lipshine in Buff. This is a sheer lipstick with just the right amount of pigmentation – it’s a peachy nude colour with shimmery golden undertones that complemented the gold on my eyes perfectly. You don’t have to stop at the face – you can accentuate your shoulders and décolletage with some shimmery body bronzer for that all-over golden goddess look. Apply Too Faced’s Royal Oil Coconut Body Bronzer to your arms and chest, and finish off with a dusting of powder bronzer on your collarbones.So there you have it, a golden goddess look guaranteed to get you a Hercules!",Binky says don't be afraid to experiment and even try a gold lip .

The diplomatic row between Britain and Spain over Gibraltar continued today after Spanish police entered British waters once again, just days after firing shots at a British jet-skier. The Foreign Office yesterday protested to the Spanish government after a boat from Spain’s Guardia Civil entered . Gibraltan waters and took potshots at 32-year-old Dale Villa as he rode . his jet-ski close to a popular beach. Just three days later, a police boat was seen in British waters again, in what locals described as a rebuke to the Foreign Office protest. Gibraltan news website Vox posted a photograph of the boat, which apparently set out from its base in the port of Algeciras and made two incursions into the waters around Gibraltar. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Incursion: This photograph shows a Spanish police boat which entered British waters off Gibraltar this morning . Fury: Britain was plunged into a diplomatic crisis over Gibraltar last night after Spanish police fired shots at British jet-skier Dale Villa, pictured, in waters around the Rock . Additionally, a second video of the . shooting incident emerged today, with a number of shots apparently heard . ringing out across the water. Foreign Office minister David . Lidington condemned Mr Villa's shooting as ‘completely unacceptable’ and called . on Spain to take action against those responsible. He said he had confronted his Spanish counterpart Inigo Mendez de Vigo yesterday to protest ‘in the strongest possible terms’. Mr . Lidington added: ‘I made it clear that the discharge of a weapon in or . near Gibraltar is completely unacceptable. I urged Mr Mendez de Vigo to . investigate urgently and to take action to ensure this will not happen . again.’ Video: This footage apparently shows the jet ski trying to escape from the Spanish police while under fire . Chase: Mr Villa attempted to get away from the Guardia Civil boat after it started to pursue him . In pursuit: The boat apparently fired rubber bullets while chasing the jet ski out of Spanish waters . Gibraltar's chief minister Fabian . Picardo today vowed to drag David Cameron into the diplomatic . confrontation, saying the incident was 'so serious' that he had to . ignore normal procedure. 'This incident, given what has now . been established, is so serious that it is right that I should refer it . directly to the Prime Minister,' he said. 'I will be doing so, accompanying what I send him with the relevant data for his information.' Spain's foreign ministry denied that . any shots were fired, and accused the British Government of granting too . much crebility to a 'rumour'. A . spokesman said: 'Spain will be communicating to Britain its unease at . the fact it has accepted an unconfirmed and false rumour which affects . the relationship between two partners and allies.' Worrying: The jet ski rider said he had been taking friends and family members on rides when he was chased by the Guardia Civil vessel . Dramatic: This video footage shows the jet ski being chased . Father-of-three Mr . Villa described how he had been fired at on two separate occasions as he . tested his new jet-ski with family and friends on Sunday afternoon. ‘I was very shaken and furious,’ said the delivery driver. ‘When . a huge boat is hurling after you and you hear gunshots it is very . scary. There were three policemen on the boat and I actually saw one of . them with a gun in his hand. The sovereignty of Gibraltar is a major source of tension between the UK and Spain. Both in 1967 and 2002, the people of Gibraltar rejected proposals for Spanish sovereignty. Yet, despite this, Spain still asserts a claim to the territory. The tension began in 1704 when an Anglo-Dutch force captured Gibraltor from Spain during the war of the Spanish succession. The territory was then ceded to Britain under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. Historically, it has proved to be an important base for the Royal Navy. Now, its economy is based on tourism, financial services and shipping. Under the 2006 constitution of Gibraltar, the territory governs its own . affairs although defence and foreign relations are still the . responsibility of the UK Government. Located on the southern end of the Iberian Peninsula, it is an area of 6.8 square kilometres. ‘I was just about to drop my friend . off at West Beach when I heard the first shot. I don’t really think we . took it seriously or believed it could be a gun, but clearly it was. ‘I . jumped back on again and whizzed off before realising the boat was . chasing after me and had soon fired three more shots at me. ‘I . had only just taken my friend’s ten-year-old daughter out for a spin . and was about to pick up her grandmother so we were not being . threatening or doing anything wrong. ‘Maybe . these guys were bored – it being a Sunday – but I really hope something . is going to be done about it, as it is outrageous.’ Shots can be heard . on a grainy video filmed by a witness. British sources said it was . thought the Spanish police fired rubber bullets at the man. Witness . Simy Herbert described the Guardia Civil as ‘trigger-happy’, adding: . ‘The Foreign Office has to do something now because when someone is shot . in our waters then everybody will start flapping.’ The UK’s charge d’affaires in Madrid was also despatched to make direct representations to ministers in the Spanish capital. The . incident is believed to have been witnessed by an off-duty officer from . the Royal Gibraltar Police, which has launched a formal investigation. But a spokesman for Spain’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said ‘no . incident’ had taken place’ and ‘no shot fired’. Britain was given Gibraltar in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, but Spain has said it will never renounce its claim to sovereignty. British . sources said Gibraltar suffered frequent illegal incursions into its . waters by Spanish boats, including police and naval vessels. From . December last year to April, officials recorded 176 illegal incursions . by Spanish boats. Anger: The Government has criticised Spanish police after shots were fired at a British jet skier in Gibraltar . Shooting: This map shows how the incident unfolded . Last . November, Madrid was accused of an unlawful incursion into Britain’s . territorial waters after a Spanish warship called Vencedora, a 288ft . corvette, came within three miles of Gibraltar’s coast. The ship ignored radio warnings to leave the area and HMS Scimitar, a seven-man patrol boat, was scrambled to intercept. Mr Picardo described the incident as a ‘scandalous . act of aggression which is illegal, imprudent, unprofessional and . irresponsible’. In a joint . statement, Tory MEPs Giles Chichester, Ashley Fox and Julie Girling – . who represent Gibraltar in the European Parliament – said Spanish . provocation was ‘a form of international political posturing by a . struggling government which hopes to distract attention from its . domestic failures’. They . added: ‘For a shot to be fired will push to a new level the offence . caused to the people of Gibraltar. 'This action is wholly illegal and as . provocative as it is reckless.’ Action: Following the shooting, a Royal Navy Rib similar to this intercepted the Rio Cedena and told it to leave the waters .

Experts ranked the cut-price supermarket's gin alongside more established rivals and a bottle from from Harrods. The budget Aldi  £9.65 Oliver Cromwell London Dry Gin has sold in the supermarket since 1999. It comes in 70cl bottles and is described as having a 'ripe, citrus aroma with rounded spice and a touch of juniper'. It is the only Aldi own label gin and is distilled for a 'clear, crisp, complex flavour'. Adjudicators at the International Spirits Challenge awarded it a silver medal, the same as The London No.1 Gin, which sells for £35 at Harrods. The Worship Street Whistling Shop Cream Gin, which costs £55.95, also won silver. But mainstream brands such as Bombay Sapphire, selling for £21.70, and Hendricks, at  £26.39, only won bronze.

The 3-year-old boy found dead after his parents mistakenly left him in a hot car in Florida over the weekend died of hypothermia, an autopsy has revealed. Kyrese Anderson was pronounced dead on Saturday afternoon after being mistakenly left inside a hot SUV for up to four hours as his parents attended the funeral. 'It's very, very tragic and everything . the detectives have uncovered so far point to it being a very tragic . accident,' Dave Bristow of the Manatee County Sheriff's Office. Tragedy: This is the Florida home where Kyrese Anderson, 3, died after his parents accidentally left him in a hot car for four hours while they went to the funeral of another family member . The confusion started when the baby's . parents, Robert Anderson, 29, and Amanda Jo Anderson, 30, took two cars . to drop their children off with a babysitter about 1 p.m. The two older children - ages 4 and 5 - were in one of the vehicles, while Kyrese was in the other. The . Andersons dropped the two older kids off with the babysitter but forgot . about Kyrese. They then took one car to the funeral and left the other - . the one containing the boy - in front of the babysitter's house, as the . hot, mid-day sun beat down upon it. 'They . get back from the funeral several hours later - and they ask where the . 3-year-old was, and the babysitter said, ""I thought he was with you?'"" Bristow told NBC2. Heat related vehicle deaths amongst children are relatively rare and tend to happen in places with warmer climates like the southwest and Florida . The couple rushed to the car and . found the baby unresponsive inside at about 4 p.m. and called 911. Kyrese was pronounced dead at a local hospital. The Manatee County Sheriff's Office is . investigating the case. So far, no charges have been filed against the . parents or babysitter. After the autopsy was completed, experts said the official cause of death was hyperthermia. Heat . related vehicle deaths amongst children are relatively rare and tend . to happen, as one would imagine, more frequently in places with warmer . climates, like the southwest and Florida. According . to the website KidsandCars.org, 33 children were killed in the U.S. when they were left in hot cars in 2011. That's down from 49 in 2010. The table shows non-traffic fatalities amongst children and shows that there were 613 heat-related deaths between 1991 and 2011 . The group suggests parents take precautions to keep them from forgetting about children sitting in rear car seats. For example, leaving a purse or cell phone in the backseat is a good way to ensure that you will look in the back of the vehicle before getting out of it. The group also suggests putting a large stuffed animal in the seat when the baby is not in the vehicle. When the baby is in the vehicle, the group suggests you put the stuffed animal in the front seat as a reminder that a baby is in the back. Additionally, the group suggests parents get in the habit of always opening a rear door when they reach a destination - the group calls this ' look before you lock.'","Kyrese Anderson was left in the car for four hours on Saturday afternoon .

Remembered: More than 200 people attended Richard Briers's funeral at Chiswick's St Michael and All Angels church near the actor's home in West London yesterday . Had Tom Good been allowed to organise his own funeral, his remains would surely have been finely mulched and scattered on the soil of the Good Life's suburban garden. The guests would have toasted his memory with a glass of home-made pea-pod burgundy, and Margot, perhaps, would have turned up in clothing more appropriate for Claridge's than the cabbage patch. What a splendid final episode it would have made for a TV series that captivated most of the viewing nation, including the Queen, for three years during the 1970s - then went on to win millions more fans through repeats around the world. But the finale they gave yesterday to actor Richard Briers recalled far more than his portrayal of Tom and the self-sufficient life in Surbiton that he and screen wife Barbara championed. Instead, a congregation of family and friends joined a cast list from the last half century of film, theatre, TV and comedy to pay tribute to the real Richard Briers - father, grandfather, family clown to his young grandchildren, lover of Shakespeare, and a man with no pretence at celebrity. Thus, the small church near his West London home became a reunion hall for names and faces long familiar to British audiences, among them Felicity Kendal, who played Barbara, and Penelope Keith, who played Margot, now with a combined age approaching 140. Actors including Bernard Cribbins, Peter Bowles, Frank Finlay, Prunella Scales and June Whitfield joined the congregation, as did his great friends Sir Kenneth Branagh and Sheila Hancock. Brian Murphy, the George in George and Mildred, brought applause with a reading of John Betjeman's Subaltern's Love Song; and Penelope Wilton, Briers' co-star from Ever Decreasing Circles, read from The Death of Sir Henry Irving. Paying tribute: The actor's co-stars in The Good Life, Felicity Kendal (left) and Penelope Keith (right) Loving couple: The late actor's wife Annie Briers at the service near their West London home yesterday . Also there were some of the so-called ordinary people whose lives Briers touched simply through his ability to treat everyone equally - and, crucially - to make them laugh. 'He wasn't starry,' said Father Kevin Morris, Vicar of Chiswick's St. Michael and All Angels church. 'He knew everyone, from the pet-shop owner to the newsagent, to near neighbours...' The last time the pair met, he revealed, Briers was complaining that he had to give a speech to the Actors' Church Union. 'I'm not even bloody religious,' he told Father Kevin. 'Well,' the minister told the congregation as he looked around the church yesterday. 'You are now.' He suggested Briers would currently be 'performing at the heavenly banquet' and added: 'Forgive me if I say about him: it was a Good Life.' Famous faces: The service was attended by stars from the world of television, film and theatre, including Emma Thompson (left) and Prunella Scales (right) Hit show: Picture from The Good Life showing Richard Briers with Felicity Kendal, who played Barbara . A really good life: Richard Briers (second left) in a 1975 episode of the Good Life with Felicity Kendal (left), Penelope Keith (centre right) and Paul Eddington (right) More than 200 people attended the funeral, some who knew him more as a likeable local than as one of the country's best loved sit-com stars. Few outsiders will have known, for example, that he and his ex-actress wife Annie lived for 45 years in a suburb not unlike the Good Life's portrayal of Surbiton. Popular: Richard Briers in his most famous role as Tom Good in The Good Life, alongside Penelope Keith . He was a familiar face at charity and social events there and was frequently the self-effacing guest of honour at the Bedford Park annual festival, Chiswick. He was also a great family man - evident not least from the wedding and family photographs incorporated into the order of service. One showed him carrying his bride, Annie, on the first day of a 1956 marriage that would last until his death last month; another as a young man with his daughters Lucy and Kate. The cover photograph showed him as many may remember him - smiling in the sunshine on a bench in the garden. Yesterday Kate told the service the family had been overwhelmed with messages of condolence in the wake of her father's death. One suggested: 'It must seem strange to be sharing such a time of grief with the whole country.' 'It wasn't,' Kate told us. 'It was with a feeling of awe and comfort that one man could have had such a powerful and positive affect on people - and that that man was my dad.' As they left the service, guests signed a memorial book to be presented to his family after a private cremation. Emma Thompson may have echoed Briers' view when she shared a joke with a message that read: 'I simply can't understand what all the fuss is about.' Recognition: Richard Briers after receiving his CBE, pictured with his wife Annie and grandchildren Harry and Rachael at Buckingham Palace . Old friends: The actor with his Marriage Lines co-star and lifelong friend Prunella Scales during an interview for the Daily Mail . Celebrated: Mr Briers was most famous for his sitcoms but was also an outstanding classical actor and voice over artist . Underneath she wrote: 'Get a bloody haircut - Yours, God.' Branagh, who signed Briers to his Renaissance Theatre Company in 1987 and featured him in nine Shakespeare film productions, wrote: 'With love to a darling man. Thank you for being.' Afterwards he said of the service: 'I think he would have thought it was wonderful.' And the fictional Mr Good? At least he finally fulfilled his dream to escape the rat-race.

New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez has been pictured posing with gun as he is charged with murder over the alleged execution of his friend Odin Lloyd. Prosecutors claim that the 23-year-old tight end picked up Lloyd at his house, drove him to an abandoned industrial park and killed him with five gunshots - all because he talked to the 'wrong people' at a nightclub. Hernandez, who had a $37.5million NFL contract, was arrested at his mansion in North Attleboro, Massachusetts, yesterday and charged with murder and weapons violations. Less than two hours after his arrest, the Patriots cut Hernandez from the team - despite paying him a $12.5million signing bonus last year. Scroll down for video . Gun: Aaron Hernandez was pictured posing with a Glock handgun when he was a student in 2009 . Charged: Aaron Hernandez was charged with murder and weapons counts on Wednesday afternoon . The picture of Hernandez posing with a . Glock handgun dates back to 2009, when he was playing . football for the University of Florida in Gainesville, according to TMZ. The website reported that Hernandez felt the need to stock up on guns because he was worried about death threats from members of gangs of which he used to be a part. Friends told TMZ that the football star joined a gang when he was a teenager, but was concerned that figures from his 'old lifestyle' were angry that he had abandoned them. His arrest yesterday caps off more than a week of . intense media scrutiny. Lloyd, a semi-professional football player who . was dating the sister of Hernandez's girlfriend, was found murdered . execution-style less than a mile from Hernandez's $1.3million home on . June 17. Hernandez is being held without bail, with the judge citing the gravity of the crime as the main reason behind his decision. Hearing: A member of the state's attorney's office went through the detailed evidence against Hernandez . A piece of chewed bubblegum could prove to be the key piece of evidence in Aaron Hernandez's murder trial, according to prosecutors. At a hearing yesterday, lawyers claimed that on the night of Odin Lloyd's murder the Patriots star stopped at a gas station to buy a pack of blue cotton-candy flavoured Bubblicious gum. The next morning, Hernandez returned the car to the company which had hired it to him, whose staff cleared out its contents and put them in a dumpster. Police later found a bullet shell casing, matching those found at the scene of Lloyd's shooting, next to a chewed piece of blue bubblegum. DNA tests will be able to establish for sure whether the gum was chewed by Hernandez. Hernandez has hired two of the . nation's top criminal defense attorneys, who maintain that the evidence . against him is 'circumstantial.' According to the Boston Globe, prosecutors revealed that Hernandez 'orchestrated' the murder of Lloyd because he had talked to a group of people that Hernandez 'had trouble with' at a Boston nightclub on Friday night. Deadspin reports that prosecutors have a video showing Hernandez with a handgun saying 'You can't trust anyone anymore' before making the trip to pick up Lloyd. Prosecutors said Hernandez and two men picked 27-year-old Lloyd up at his house in Dorchester early Monday morning in a rented SUV. Apparently, Lloyd had misgivings about the meeting and sent text messages to his family. 'Did you see who I am with?' he asked. Then he responded, cryptically, 'NFL,' prosecutor said. He later added: 'Just so you know.' It was his last text message. In custody: The state's attorney argued that Hernandez had the means to flee and should be held without bail before his trial . Weeping: Relatives of murder victim Odin Lloyd were in the courtroom when Hernandez was charged . Support: Hernandez's live-in girlfriend Shayanna Jenkins was visibly emotional when she left the courthouse without him . Prosecutors then recounted how . Hernandez drove Lloyd to the industrial park. When he stepped out of the . SUV, Hernandez allegedly shot him one in the chest with a .45-caliber . pistol - knocking Lloyd to the ground, according to prosecutors. As he lay on the ground, Lloyd reached up in an attempt to shield himself. Hernandez allegedly shot him four more times in the chest. The investigation started more than a . week ago after semi-pro football player Odin Lloyd was found slain in an . industrial park in North Attleborough, on the Rhode Island line not far . from where the Patriots play. Video emerged of Hernandez being taken . from his home in handcuffs, which followed after Massachusetts state . police - wearing wetsuits and armed with metal detectors - combed . through a stream near his home yesterday. However, the officers left . empty-handed after turning up no new evidence in the execution-style . murder of semi-pro football player Odin Lloyd, who was reportedly last . seen partying with Hernandez in Boston. A Massachusetts court said yesterday it had sealed documents related to the killing of Odin. Attleboro . District Court officials said documents related to the case, including . search warrants, have been impounded, meaning the public can't see them. Trouble: The Patriots player had a connection to the victim . Next step: After his arraignment, he was transferred by the Bristol County Sheriff's office . Get comfortable: The 23-year-old was dropped by the Patriots shortly after he was arrested Wednesday morning . On . Saturday, investigators and police canines searched Hernandez's . $1.3million mansion for a second time. They left with several brown . paper bags of evidence, but did not make an arrest. Lloyd, a semi-pro football player, was friends with Hernandez and was with him on Monday morning before he was shot in the head. His . body was dumped in an industrial park less than a mile from Hernandez's . luxury home in the Boston suburb of North Attleborough, Massachusetts. Hernandez, 23, has been under intense . media scrutiny since news of the murder broke. Police, however, have . not named him - or anyone else - a suspect in the case. About . two dozen reporters, photographers and video producers were camped . outside his house on Monday, looking for any sign of the tight end, who . signed a $37.5million five-year contract with the Patriots last year. Arrest: Hernandez is led from his home in handcuffs this morning one day after his home was searched for the fourth time .

Over $1 million in $100 bills was stolen from a shipping container on a Swiss Air passenger flight on its way to New York and investigators still don't know who's to blame. The shipment on flight 17 left Zurich Saturday, but by the time it reached its destination at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, $1.2 million of the $92 million aboard was gone. ‘When it got here, the money was missing,’ FBI spokesman Jim Margolin said. Heist: Police are investigating after $1.2million in cash was found to be missing from a Swiss Air Lines jet when it arrived at JFK airport, pictured, in New York yesterday . The theft was discovered at the official count of the cash at the Federal Reserve offices in Manhattan. However, it remains unclear if the money was stolen in Switzerland or somewhere en route. According to ABC News, a forklift operator 'opened the sealed crate and noticed damage to one of the crates in the form of a puncture from a forklift. It was a hole large enough to put your arm in.' However, the operator failed to report the hole because such damage commonly occurs to the crates after years of use. 'We do not have any indication of a robbery of a Swiss aircraft,' a Swiss Air representative told ABC. Officials have not disclosed who the money was meant for or why it was being sent. A spokesman for the FBI in New York Jim Margolin confirmed that the theft was being investigated but would not elaborate on the details. No comment: Jim Margolin, spokesman for the FBI in New York, confirmed the incident but declined to provide further information . Investigators are now looking in to how . many mechanics, crew members and airport personnel had access to . the jet and whether any of them could feasibly have emptied the box and . escaped unnoticed. According to the US Treasury, $1 million in $100 bills is estimated to weigh just 22 pounds, meaning a thief could easily cart around the cash. The largest cash heist in JFK Airport history happened on December 11, 1978, when an estimated $5 million was stolen at the Lufthansa Airlines terminal. At the time it was also the largest cash theft to have been carried out on US soil and went on to be portrayed in the movie 'Goodfellas'. It is not unusual for airlines to transport large sums of money - with a single flight sometimes carrying more than $1 billion.

A Peruvian housekeeper has accused a top United Nations official of treating her like a virtual slave. María Ríos Fun, 40, is suing Marita Puertas Pulgar, the first secretary of the Peruvian mission, and her husband, Alexis Aquino Albegrin, claiming the couple lured her from Lima, Peru to the U.S. with the promise of fair wages and a humane work schedule but when she arrived it was all a sham. According to Ms Ríos, she was given just one day off every six weeks and could only leave the house to pick up the couple's children. All the while she was being bullied and coerced by the pair, she said in a lawsuit filed in Newark. Trafficking: María Ríos Fun, pictured, is suing her former employer, an official in Peru's UN mission, for labor trafficking . 'I don't want others to go through what I did,' she told The New York Times. Ms Puertas and Mr Aquino have vehemently rejected the human trafficking allegations, adding that they were 'surprised' by what the woman, who they'd known for a decade, claimed happened. Ms Ríos worked for the couple in Buenos Aires in the early 2000s and late in Lima Peru but did not complain about their treatment during those postings. However, she claims a contract she signed with her employers before coming to the U.S. in October 2012, which promised weekends and overtime pay, was entirely disregarded. Under the terms of the contract, according to The New York Times, she would be paid $9.82 per hour to work as a 'housekeeper' for seven hours a day, five days a week and if any overtime would be paid at $14.73 per hour. She also was promised sick days and 15 paid vacation days per year, as well as three meals a day, six days a week, the lawsuit states. But as soon as she arrived, the contract was thrown out the window she claims, and she was forced to work from dawn to 10 p.m. not only cleaning the two-story, four-bedroom house but also to cook for the family of six. She had to care and change the youngest child, who was 18-months, and drive the older children to and from school. Diplomat: Marita Puertas Pulgar, the first secretary of the Peruvian mission to the United Nations, pictured, and her husband, Alexis Aquino Albegrin allegedly treated their housekeeper like a virtual slave . She was also required to tend to house guests and the garden, she claims and was only given 'very basic food, like bread and coffee,' meaning she 'frequently was hungry.' The agreed wage also turned out to be a lie, according to The Times. Instead of the $9.82 an hour promised, she said the couple told her they would pay her a flat rate of $900 a month, slashing the earnings she had been expecting. But even that didn't happen she claims. According to Ms Ríos, she said she only got several hundred dollars each month after the couple  deducted cash to cover the cost of clothing and toiletries they bought her. She was also only given four days off in six months, she said, and was confined to the home where she was subjected to 'verbal abuse and psychological coercion.' On April 27, it got too much and Ms Ríos called a national human trafficking hot line that was listed in documents she had been given at the United States embassy in Lima. She ran away, seeking refuge at Safe Horizon, an agency in New York City that helps crime victims. The organization gave her counseling and a lawyer, who presumably helped with the suit. The lawsuit said Ms Ríos is seeking unspecified back wages and damages for trafficking and breach of contract and she wants her belongings back.","María Ríos Fun, 40, is suing Marita Puertas Pulgar and her husband, Alexis Aquino Albegrin for back pay and damages .

Hubert, 32, from Illinois, was charged on Friday, one day after his wife found their 23-month-old son Nathan in their car, where he was trapped in temperatures of up to 135 degrees for more than two hours. He was also charged with two counts of endangering the welfare of a child because his four-year-old daughter was at home when he was passed out. He was released on $250,000 bail on Saturday.

The county coroner has said 23-month-old Nathan had a temperature of 104.6 degrees when first responders arrived on Thursday afternoon. The temperature that day was above 90. Hubert took Nathan out to his vehicle, a black Hyundai Elantra four-door with a dark-colored interior, at about 2:30pm with plans to make a trip, according to O'Fallon Police. Inside, a charging document says, Hubert 'consumed alcohol to a level which caused him to pass out'. The boy's mother came home about 5pm and the child was found strapped into his car seat. Only one of the windows in the vehicle was cranked open. When police arrived at the home, the mother was in the yard cradling her son and wailing. Nathan was pronounced dead at the scene. Neighbors described Hubert as a loving father. A phone message left for Hubert on Sunday wasn't returned.

Nathan was the 13th child to die this summer alone from being left in an overheated car. On average, 38 children die in the United States each year because they are either forgotten and left inside a vehicle or manage to get inside without anyone knowing and then cannot get back out. Over the weekend, a three-year-old boy in Florida died after his parents accidentally left him in the car while they were attending a funeral. Kyrese Anderson was pronounced dead after spending about three hours in the back of the hot car, with his siblings and babysitter just feet away. Earlier this month, a five-month-old baby girl died after being left in a minivan for hours. KidsandCars.org suggests parents take precautions to keep them from forgetting about children sitting in rear car seats. For example, leaving a purse or cell phone in the backseat is a good way to ensure that you will look in the back of the vehicle before getting out of it. Another way is to put a large stuffed animal in the seat when the baby is not in the vehicle. When the baby is in the vehicle, the group suggests you put the stuffed animal in the front seat as a reminder that a baby is in the back.","Nathan Hubert was strapped into car seat for more than two hours .

David Cameron's promise of a referendum on whether Britain should cut all ties with Brussels has reversed the flood of Tory voters switching to UKIP. And pressure on Labour leader Ed Miliband to follow suit is set to grow after calls for him to back a nationwide vote on the issue won big support in a Mail on Sunday poll. The survey suggests the Prime Minister’s EU referendum vow  has prompted a Tory bounce, with Labour’s lead cut by two points to seven per cent. According to the Survation poll for this newspaper, Labour has a clear lead on 38 per cent, followed by the Tories on 31, UKIP on 14 and the Lib Dems on a lowly ten. The two-point gain for the Conservatives since the New Year appears to have come directly from UKIP, who are down by two. And the Conservatives received another boost today after UKIP leader Nigel Farage announced he now aims to target pro-EU Mr Miliband instead of Mr Cameron. Mr Farage denounced the Labour leader’s ‘abject’ refusal to back a nationwide in/out ballot on the EU and said he was now ‘gunning for Labour’. It is a marked change in tone from Mr Farage, whose sustained and  vitriolic attacks on ‘that man’ Mr Cameron in the past year have seen Tory defectors take UKIP’s ratings to record levels. If Mr Cameron delivers his promise of negotiating big concessions,  it could help his avowed aim of  persuading voters to stay in the EU . In a separate move, former Labour Prime . Minister Tony Blair today uses a Mail on Sunday article to urge . pro-Europeans to rally behind the campaign for an ‘in’ vote – and offers . to help to mobilise supporters. ‘At present the EU is the most powerful political union and biggest business market in the world,’ he writes. ‘We will need it to remain at the top and we will need to be part  of it. For the UK to leave the bloc right on its doorstep would be an extraordinary denial of its own interests... I believe there is a sensible, solid majority in the UK for us to stay in Europe. It is time to start mobilising it.’ Mr Farage, also writing in this newspaper, said he planned to cash in on Labour’s split over the referendum. ‘David Cameron wants to renegotiate our relationship with Europe, followed by an opportunity to vote “out” if he is elected after 2015,’  he writes. Ed Miliband exposed an 'open flank' according to UKIP leader Nigel farage . ‘Here was an open goal for the Labour Party to demand that referendum now. They could have called his bluff. Ed Miliband could have pressed the Prime Minister to give voters a say on Europe without ifs and buts. Yet they didn’t. As a party, we not only see this as a political failure on Labour’s part, but a betrayal.’ In a move which will be interpreted as a tacit ‘pact’ with the Conservatives, Mr Farage is planning to concentrate Election campaign resources on Labour-held councils and Commons constituencies. A spring advertising offensive by UKIP will highlight Mr Miliband’s opposition to a referendum and blame Labour for failing to stem  the  expected wave of fresh  immigration from Bulgaria and Romania when restrictions are relaxed in December. ‘Miliband has exposed an open flank,’ Mr Farage says. ‘We are going for the Labour Party’s jugular .  .  . UKIP is now a serious player in British politics and we are not going to go away. ‘We represent not just disgruntled, disenchanted Conservatives but everyone in Britain affected by the loss of sovereignty that comes with being a member of the EU.’ The Survation figures help explain Mr Farage’s decision to chase votes from Labour supporters disillusioned with Mr Miliband’s anti-EU referendum stance. A majority say Mr Cameron’s Europe speech last week was ‘statesmanlike’. If the referendum was held today, Britons would vote by 50 per cent to 36 in favour of leaving the EU. The top three powers that voters  want back from Brussels are immigration, farming hand-outs and employment laws. If Mr Cameron delivers his promise of negotiating big concessions,  it could help his avowed aim of  persuading voters to stay in the EU. Of those who currently want to leave, more than two out of five say it would make them reconsider. Voters think Britain would be less of a world power outside the EU, but they are swayed by the belief that they would be richer. A total of 41 per cent say we would be better off economically if we leave, against 26 who say we will be worse off. More than one in three say we would lose diplomatic clout, compared with one in five who say we would have more. But while Mr Cameron’s EU referendum policy gets a thumbs-up, there is widespread scepticism about his motives – and whether he will match his words with deeds. Four out of ten say they do not trust him to deliver a referendum, against three out of ten who do. An overwhelming 62 per cent say the referendum vow is to stop a Tory split and undermine UKIP. Just 26 per cent say the Prime Minister acted out of principle. Worringly for Mr Miliband, demands by Eurosceptic Labour MPs for him to match Mr Cameron’s referendum offer are supported by 45 per cent. But a Miliband  U-turn would pose risks: the survey emphasises Labour supporters are as overwhelmingly pro-EU as the Tories are overwhelmingly anti-EU.","MoS poll: voters desert UKIP for Conservative Party .

Battle: The wine companies who lay claim to the distinctive Babycham logo of a leaping baby antelope have lodged a High Court writ against Cath Kidston Ltd . One is instantly recognisable as the logo of Babycham sparkling perry. The other adorned Cath Kidston products at Christmas – but has left some feeling anything but festive. Babycham has launched legal  proceedings against the British homeware company, claiming its use of a baby deer with a ribbon on its neck infringed the drinks firm’s rights. The High Court writ also claims that the appearance of the logo on Cath Kidston products aimed at under-18s associates Babycham ‘with a blatant disregard for industry codes of  practice to protect children’. The Guildford-based company behind the drink wants an injunction to stop Cath Kidston using the image, plus destruction of all products marked with it. But Cath Kidston denies perplexing shoppers, insisting that – although  its seasonal deer image and the Babycham logo are both ‘hoofed ruminants, unaccustomed to wearing ribbons’ – there is no confusing similarity between the two. Lawyer Philip Roberts said: ‘The differences in the manner of execution speak for themselves, not least  . . . the absence of horns and the springing “springbok” stance.’ Barrister David Wilkinson, for Western Wines Holdings Ltd and Accolade Wines Ltd, said in the writ: 'The claimants and their predecessors in title have, since 1953, used in relation to Babycham sparkling perry and related goods various iterations of a logo with the common theme of a baby chamois with a ribbon tied round its neck. 'Indeed Babycham was the first alcoholic brand and the second ever brand to be advertised on commercial television in the UK with a campaign in 1957. 'Cath Kidston Ltd has used and continues to use a logo in relation to its Christmas 2012 advertising campaign and range of related goods, which depicts a baby deer with a ribbon tied around its neck, which is substantially similar to the Babycham logo,' adds Mr Wilkinson. 'Their use in the course of trade of the Kidston Logo without due cause in relation to goods similar to those for which the registered marks are registered, take unfair advantage of, and is detrimental to, the distinctive character and repute of the Babycham logo,' it states. 'A drink, its packaging and any promotional material or activity should not in any direct or indirect way have a particular appeal to under-18s. The use of the Kidston Logo includes use on products relevant to under 18s, such as children's clothes . 'The application of the Kidston Logo to goods relevant to under-18s is liable to cause serious tarnishing and detriment to the repute of Babysham by associating (it) in the minds of the public and trade with a blatant disregard for industry codes of practise to protect children.' Brand: One of the Cath Kidston deer designs which are accused of infringing the copyright of the Babycham leaping chamois logo .

Hannah, Lena Dunham's character on Girls, is not known for having a designer wardrobe; in fact, her constant mooching off friends and flitting from job to job would suggest exactly the opposite. Yet in recent photos taken during filming of the HBO show's upcoming third season, the actress is seen wearing a McQ by Alexander McQueen dress, which retails at full price for $1,165. While Hannah does get more into character by accessorizing the graphic look with a pair of well-worn sneakers, the graphic print frock is a far cry from the frumpy looks she donned in earlier seasons. Out of character? Lena Dunham was spotted in a chic McQ by Alexander McQueen frock while shooting the upcoming season of Girls - a far cry from her character Hannah's usual frumpy looks . Pricey: The dress retails for $1,165, which Hannah surely couldn't afford with her frugal lifestyle. But stylist Jenn Rogien said that a 'chic dress' is part of that episode's story - and that she found it on the sale rack . Hannah-friendly discount: On shopbop.com, the peplum frock is on sale for $932 . The show's stylist, Jenn Rogien told MailOnline that Hannah's chic dress is 'part of the story' for that particular episode that was being filmed. 'That dress was a perfect choice,' she said, adding this is 'probably the only designer piece we've used on Hannah.' The stylist explained that 'thankfully - for the story and for my budget,' she found it on the sale rack. But the designer frock is still markedly more fashion-forward than the somewhat dowdy duds Hannah typically wears. Indeed, in January Ms Rogien told the Huffington Post that she makes her character appear disheveled on purpose. 'They don't quite hit at the right place,' she said of the clothes Hannah wears. 'We mess with the hem lengths so they're not exactly the best or most flattering length. Stepping up her fashion game? The actress was also spotted wearing a cheerful $148 Anthropologie dress (left) on Tuesday, and a demure skirt-top combo (right) that same day . 'We don't press her clothes, so that they aren't completely put together,' she explained, adding: 'We're using the costume to help support her emotional journey. 'Sometimes that means having things . dwarf her a little bit, or be intentionally awkwardly fitting because . that's helping to drive the emotion, support the story and reflect . what's going on.' 'Hannah's look is evolving to support her story this season' Indeed, in the fifth episode of season two, Hannah wore a too-short grey and orange playsuit when she had her dalliance with Joshua, the doctor. While at first it seemed their fling was good for Hannah, giving her a confidence boost, it all came crashing down at the end of the episode when she cried into his lap, and he consequently lost all interest. And who could forget the bright yellow mesh tank top she sported during her cocaine-fulled night out with Elijah? You are what you wear: In previous seasons, Hannah's clothes were often awkward fitting - which, according to Girls stylist Jenn Rogien, was actually done on purpose to reflect her 'emotional journey' Disheveled: Ms Rogien explained: 'Sometimes [we make] things dwarf her a little bit, or be intentionally awkwardly fitting because that's helping to drive the emotion, support the story and reflect what's going on' While . she and her roommate seemed to enjoy themselves, the episode came to a . head when Hannah confronted Marnie about being a 'bad friend'. But . it seems Hannah's 'emotional journey' may have a happy destination . after all. 'She might be almost getting it kind of together,' Ms Rogien told MailOnline. 'But she is still our Hannah and still doesn't have a ton of money.' Many of her outfits of late have been markedly more . put-together than usual - though not all are as pricey as the McQ dress. On Tuesday, Lena was spotted on set in a stylish navy number from Anthropologie.The $148 dress was adorned with a bright orange cherry pattern, which she topped off with a pair of brown woven flats. That same day, the 27-year-old stepped out in a demure skirt-and-top ensemble with a crisp white collar. Are things looking up for Hannah? 'Hannah's look is evolving just a bit to support her story this season,' said Ms Rogien. 'We're tweaking each of the girls' looks to keep up with their adventures' She . wore the same well-worn canvas sneakers with this outfit, which included . embellished sleeves and a see-through black panel at the hem of the . skirt. Ms Rogien has said in the past that Hannah is vintage-driven, which is reflected in her wardrobe, but that she also is the type to save up for pricier items from shops like Madewell and Anthropologie. Whether Hannah simply saved up for her McQ dress, or whether the plot explains her new-found penchant for designer, remains unclear. 'I don't want to give anything away,' said Ms Rogien, adding: 'It was the right dress for the right moment. 'Hannah's look is evolving just a bit to support her story this season,' she said. 'We're tweaking each of the girls' looks to keep up with their adventures.'",Girls stylist Jenn Rogien told MailOnline: 'Thankfully - for the story and my budget - we discovered the dress on the sale rack'

Proving a point: The former Westlife singer, pictured here with wife Vogue, cancelled his Ryanair flight after the airline requested a fee for printing off a boarding pass . Former Westlife star Brian McFadden has called the chief executive of Ryanair a 'scumbag' in an angry Twitter rant after the airline tried to charge him an extra £150 to fly when he arrived at Liverpool Airport. The Irish pop singer was told by check-in staff that he would need to fork out an extra £70 to . print his boarding pass and £80 for going four kilograms . over the carrier's baggage weight limit.

As . predicted, it was the hottest day of the year so far with the . thermometer peaking at 22C (72F) in Gravesend and Manston in Kent.

The National Trust was expecting the . ‘main pulse’ of migrating birds – including swallows and house martins – . to arrive over the weekend with the help of strong southerly winds. But Grahame Madge of the RSPB said: . ‘We’re actually not sure where they all are. Possibly many have already . arrived and perished or they may be hanging around waiting for the right . conditions.’ He added: ‘When they arrive they are . exhausted. They have probably lost half their body weight and are right . on the edge of survival. ‘If they arrive and there are no insects to feed on they are in big trouble. We could be looking at a bleak picture.’ Bluebells are one wonder of the British countryside that have yet to appear. It is thought peak flowering could be . delayed until mid-May this year. There are also fears that many . daffodils may not flower at all. Tom Price, curator of Oxford . University’s Botanic Garden, said: ‘It’s possible the bulbs have been . damaged by the prolonged wet, and then very cold weather.

'No training in stone design': Kristian Childs . arrives for sentencing at Northampton Crown Court after admitting . breaching health and safety rules . A builder whose company fitted a stone fireplace that collapsed on top of a four-year-old boy and crushed him to death has been fined more than £10,000. Matthew Green died of internal injuries when the 110lb chunk of masonry dropped on to his chest and snapped in two in the living room of his new-build home in Towcester, Northamptonshire. The boy was airlifted to Northampton General Hospital following the accident on October 15, 2005 but died hours later of heart injuries caused by blunt chest trauma. Yesterday Kristian Childs, 43, - whose former company K D Childs Stonework fitted the fireplace - was fined £10,015 after admitting breaching health and safety regulations. He pleaded guilty at Northampton Crown Court in April last year to breaching Section 3(1) of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. The court heard the stonemason had fitted the stone lintel to the new-build Persimmon home when it was built in 2003. When the feature fell apart just two years later, crushing Matthew, it was discovered the fireplace had not been bolted into place but stuck with glue. Matthew's father David had been greeting friends at the door when he heard a loud crash in the living room. He returned to the house to find his son slumped against the fireplace, dying. Investigations concluded that there was a lack of mortar fixing the mantelpiece to the fireplace. Prosecuting, Mark Harris, said: 'The mantelpiece fell and struck him, the fireplace had been designed by Mr Childs and was fitted by his employees. 'The immediate cause of the accident was the failure of the stonework which was not fixed properly. 'Mrs Green had been shopping shortly before 11am, the family was expecting friends around lunchtime. 'When they arrived the door was answered by Matthew who was excited to have visitors. 'Mr Green was in the hallway when Matthew then ran into the lounge and almost immediately he heard a crash and a thud from the lounge. 'On entering the room the found Matthew slumped against the fireplace with the mantelpiece across his chest in two. 'Emergency services were called, Mrs Green arrived home shortly before and Matthew and Mr Green were air-lifted to hospital where he died.' An inquest in 2008 heard the family bought the four-bedroom detached property for £260,000 in June 2003 with the mantelpiece already installed. Childs wasn’t charged until six years after the incident and pleaded guilty to failing to discharge his duty with the design and installation of the fireplace - thereby exposing Matthew to danger. Lawyers acting for Persimmon Homes (Midlands) and its York-based parent company Persimmon Homes, who had sub-contracted Childs, entered not guilty pleas to failing in the construction of homes, 'to ensure persons not in employment were not exposed to risks to their health and safety'. Charges against these companies were dropped. Tragic: Matthew Green, four, was killed . when a 110lb lump of stone from a fireplace installed by Childs's . company dropped on to his chest. It was later found to have been held in . place with glue rather than bolts . Matthew's father David had been greeting friends at the door of their new build home on this street when he heard a loud crash in the living room. He returned to find his son slumped against the fireplace, dying . John Williams, defending Childs, said: 'Mr Childs wishes to make it very clear that he regrets this offence occurred. 'Matthew Green tragically died as a result of this offence and he offers his unreserved apologies to Mr and Mrs Green. 'Nothing I say afterwards should dilute this apology.' Sentencing him, Judge Rupert Mayo said: 'Mr Childs had no training in stone design, manufacturing or restoration. 'He does not keep records, there are no sketches or method statements with his work. 'There is no doubt that his remorse and regret is genuine. His life has been affected greatly by the Greens’ loss. 'He is now divorced, a turnover on his business has gone from £400,000 to just £31,000. The news of the incident involving Matthew extinguished his business virtually overnight. 'For everyone connected with this case seven and a half years since Matthew’s tragic death must feel like a lifetime. 'This includes Mr Childs, who has never failed to accept his negligence. 'I am aware of his limited fees, his home is worth less than his mortgage, he does not own a car and has responsibilities to his own children. 'His only debt, I accept are genuine business ones, he was loaned £5,000 by his father to establish a modest property maintenance business. 'His net income is currently below £17,000 and he spends £16,000 on household expenses, in his council's words, he is just about keeping his head above the water. 'Any fine I make is not a value on the life of Matthew Green. 'To anyone that knew Matthew, to his friends and family, his life was perfectly beyond value.' 'An accident that should never have happened': Matthew's parents, Gail and David Green leaving court. In a statement they said they felt they had waited far too long for a resolution over their son's death . After after the sentence was passed, the Green family released a statement saying: 'On October 15 2005 we tragically lost our four-year-old son Matthew due to an accident that should never have happened, due to poor workmanship, no industry standards and lack of risk assessments. 'We feel that the house builder, Persimmon Homes, and the fireplace installer, K D Childs, were responsible for the death of our son. 'Unfortunately, due to irregularities in the HSE investigation the case against Persimmon Homes was dropped in April 2013. 'We have waited nearly eight years for the matter to eventually be finalised through the court which is in our opinion far too long to prolong the suffering and distress to our family. 'Whatever the outcome of the HSE prosecutions, nothing will bring back Matthew, but we want to insure that something is done to prevent incidents like this happening to any other child in the future . 'Since the inquest in 2008 we are aware of at least two further children that have tragically been killed in incidents involving fire places. 'We cannot help but feel that had the matter been dealt with more promptly and in a different manner by all those involved at least one of those needless deaths may have been prevented.'","Matthew Green killed when 110lb chunk of masonry dropped on him .

"By . Michael Seamark and Stephen Wright . UPDATED: . 03:42 EST, 12 July 2011 . Scotland Yard declared war on Rupert Murdoch's News International last night over a 'deliberate' attempt to derail the phone-hacking and police bungs investigation into the News of the World. Senior officers are disgusted by a series of leaks from within the company revealing confidential details of the Met's inquiry. The final straw came yesterday when the Queen and the Royal Family were drawn into the scandal engulfing the Murdoch machine. Security risk: Details of the movements of the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh were offered for sale to journalists . The BBC's business editor Robert Peston broke the astonishing news that the Sunday newspaper was paying a corrupt Royal Protection Officer for highly sensitive personal details about the Monarch, her close family and staff – a clear danger to security. The London Evening Standard was also briefed on the claims and within hours Scotland Yard issued an unprecedented and angry statement pointing the finger firmly at the News International empire. After days of leaks, the Met finally lost patience, saying: 'It is our belief that information that has appeared in the media today is part of a deliberate campaign to undermine the investigation into the alleged payments by corrupt journalists to corrupt police officers. 'At various meetings over the last few weeks information was shared with us by News International and their legal representatives and it was agreed by all parties that this information would be kept confidential so that we could pursue various lines of inquiry, identify those responsible without alerting them, and secure best evidence. Probe: Former NotW editor Andy Coulson, who was arrested and questioned over the scandal last week, relaxes with his family in a South London park yesterday . Scoop: The BBC's Robert Peston, left, broke the news that a royal protection officer was selling information. Former News of the World Royal Editor Clive Goodman was jailed in 2007 for phone hacking . 'However, we are extremely concerned and disappointed that the continuous release of selected information – that is only known by a small number of people – could have a significant impact on the corruption investigation.' The revelation that the Queen and her family had been targeted was the latest sensational development in the hacking and corruption scandal. According to the BBC's Mr Peston the company uncovered emails back in 2007 containing evidence a reporter was asking for £1,000 payments to give to the royal protection officer for confidential information about the Queen. In one of the emails Clive Goodman, . the newspaper's disgraced former royal editor jailed for phone-hacking, . requests cash from News of the World editor Andy Coulson to buy the . Green Book, a confidential royal directory. The emails imply that the . officer had stolen the directory. Contrary . to some reports yesterday, it does not contain private and direct . numbers for senior Royals. It contains numbers for main switchboards and . specific departments within the official residences. Nevertheless, . the book – which has the word 'secure' on the cover – is so sensitive . that when members of the Royal Household get a copy they must sign for . it. On his BBC blog Mr . Peston quotes a source saying: 'There was clear evidence from the emails . that the security of the Royal family was being put at risk. It is . quite astonishing that these emails were not handed to the police for . investigation when they were first found in 2007.' Under investigation: Rupert Murdoch, left, whose News International has been accused of a 'deliberate' attempt to derail the Met investigation, led by Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick, left . The information . being offered by the Royal Protection officer also included tips about . the Queen's movements but, despite the potential risk to royal security, . they were not passed to Scotland Yard until last month. Goodman, 53, and Mr Coulson, 43, have been arrested and bailed until October on suspicion of bribing police officers. Buckingham Palace and Clarence House would not comment. Police say the leaks have forced the Yard to 'rip up' its investigations strategy, including the timetable of planned arrests. Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick's team of 50 investigators is vetted to high level and has sworn a confidentiality oath. A senior Yard source: 'We are 110 per cent certain that leaks have not come from Met.","'I was in tears': Gordon Brown reveals his agony after Rebekah Brooks told him The Sun had seen his sick four-month-old son's medical files .

The body of a Chilean man accused in the ritual killing of a three-day-old girl was found hanged in an abandoned house in Peru. Ramon Castillo, 36, was found hanging from a beam on the second floor of the house in the highlands city of Cuzco early yesterday. He was wearing jeans, a gray jacket, a cap, shoes and a backpack, General Javier Avalos, the regional police chief, said. He said the body was identified through fingerprints that Chile sent via Interpol. He said it was too early to say whether Castillo's death was suicide. Police in neighbouring Chile had been seeking Castillo and two other members of the sect that he led for their alleged participation in the baby's killing. It happened on a hill in the town of Colliguay near the Chilean port of Valparaiso on November 23. The child's mother was arrested last week along with three other members of the sect. She allegedly approved the sacrifice. Natalie Guerra, 25, hid her face in a . coat as she attended a hearing into the killing of her daughter who was . burned alive on a bonfire. She put a hand over her mouth as she sat . alongside sect members Carla Franchy, Maria del Pilar Alvarez and David . Pastene during the tribunal in Quilpe, 70 miles west of Santiago. Chilean police have said the baby was thrown onto a bonfire because Castillo and his followers believed the child was the antichrist. Authorities said the 12-member sect was formed in 2005 and counted among its members professionals with university degrees. Arrested: The child's mother Natalie Guerra, centre, hides her face in a coat as she arrives for the tribunal in Quilpe, Chile, with sect members Carla Frachy behind, and Maria del Pilar Alvarez concealed by her jumper in front . Police said the group's rituals included using ayahuasca, a hallucinogenic plant that grows in Amazon forests. Guerra is said to have told police: 'I was devastated but (sect members) told me that it had to be -- that it was my karma.' Cult chief Ramon Gustavo Castillo Gaete, 36, who sacrificed the baby because he believed she was was the antichrist and the end of the world was near, has been on the run for weeks.

A couple has accused a council worker of ripping their padlocked front gate off its hinges so he could check if they were recycling properly. The officer from Croydon Council, in south London, was sent to question Bharat and Sheila Gandhi, who had been reported to the local authority for not leaving paper, glass and plastics out for collection. But when the officer arrived at the house in South Norwood and realised he couldn't get in, he allegedly forced the gate off its hinges. Unbeknown to him, he was being filmed by the couple's CCTV camera which had been installed after the house was burgled in 2011. Mr and Mrs Gandhi say they take their waste to Factory Lane recycling centre by hand and have accused the council of 'intrusion'. Mr Gandhi, 60, said: 'The behaviour by the council person was inexcusable and even dangerous as he left our property vulnerable and without any reason.' The council, which said the damage was accidental, has offered to refund the £100 repair costs. However, Mrs Gandhi, 56, said: 'It is not about money, it is about the principle. It would have taken a lot of force to break the gate. 'There is a bell for people to ring, which he did not.' The couple run the local Neighbourhood Watch group and lost £20,000 of possessions when they were burgled. Locked: CCTV captured the council worker arriving at the Gandhi household .

A student who was left paralysed by a rare nerve condition has made an incredible recovery and is now able play her favourite sport again. Nicola Muir, 23, was captain of her university hockey squad when she was struck down with Guillain-Barre syndrome in 2009. Within days, she was bedridden and totally unable to move her legs. Doctors told her it was unlikely she would ever recover well enough to be able to play sport again. Nicola Muir, 23, was captain of her university hockey squad when she was struck down with Guillain-Barre syndrome . However, Ms Muir, from Portsmouth, Hampshire, has not only learned to walk again - she is now running around the hockey pitch again. She said: ‘Hockey has been my passion since I started secondary school, and I was devastated when I thought I would never be able to play again. ‘I spent most of my spare time playing, and my social life revolved around nights out and trips away with the team too. ‘When I was discharged from hospital, I was in a wheelchair, and I had to learn to walk all over again. ‘I am a determined person, and I thought if I can learn to walk again, I can run. She started to feel unwell after returning from a holiday with her hockey team. She is pictured just weeks before she was admitted to hospital . ‘It's taken a long time, and it's been a very difficult journey. I was very out of breath and unfit after my first practise, but it's come back to me so naturally.' Ms Muir was studying photography at Portsmouth University when she was struck down with Guillain-Barre syndrome during the summer holidays. Guillain-Barre syndrome is an autoimmune disease which affects just one in 50,000 people in the UK. Symptoms, including pain, tingling and numbness, begin in the feet and hands and move into the arms and legs. It can also cause muscle weakness, co-ordination problems, paralysis and even death. The exact cause is not known, but most people develop the syndrome after a viral or bacterial infection. It attacks the peripheral nervous system - the network of nerves outside the central nervous system, including the motor nerves, used by the brain to control muscles. Around 20 per cent of people never recover fully from the syndrome. The condition occurs when the body's immune system attacks part of the nervous system. It is not known exactly what causes it but about 60 per cent of cases develop after a viral or bacterial infection. It is thought that the infection may trigger the immune system to attack nerve roots and peripheral nerves. About 80 per cent of sufferers make a full recovery but 20 per cent are left with problems such as an inability to walk, loss of co-ordination and loss of balance. After a week away with her hockey team, Ms Muir began suffering flu-like symptoms, and getting pins and needles in her feet - but put it down to over exerting herself on holiday. But more than a week on, her symptoms had continued to worsen and doctors thought she had swine flu. Ms Muir said: ‘I had come back from holiday feeling really rough, and I thought I'd just over-done it. ‘But after a week, my symptoms were getting worse, and I felt terrible. ‘My GP told me he thought I had swine flu, and I was given Tamiflu, but a few days later, I got up in the night and my legs just gave way under me. ‘My mum had to pick me up and carry me to the bathroom, but the doctors refused to come out and see me because they said I was infectious. ‘My symptoms carried on getting worse, and my legs just couldn't support my own weight. Doctors initially thought that Ms Muir had swine flu and said that she should be put in isolation as she was infectious . She was eventually diagnosed with Guillain-Barre syndrome when she lost the use of her legs and struggled to move her arms . ‘Eventually, a doctor did agree to see me. He arrived wearing a face mask and protective clothing - but he soon realised I probably had something more serious than swine flu.’ Ms Muir was taken to hospital by ambulance but was not allowed in for more than an hour as they thought she was infectious and had to prepare an isolation ward. Within a few days of being in the hospital her breathing had become weak, she was struggling to move her arms and she couldn’t move her legs at all. When she was discharged from hospital she needed a wheelchair and had to have months of physiotherapy and rehabilitation . At this point she was finally diagnosed with Guillain-Barre syndrome and she spent a month paralysed in hospital. Ms Muir said: ‘When I tried to lift a glass of water to my lips, I'd just throw it in my face - I had no control over my limbs and it was really frightening. ‘I was told that some people never fully recover, and there was a chance I would never walk again. ‘Fortunately, I began to recover some movement in my legs just a few weeks after my treatment started. Ms Muir says that her hockey coach (pictured) and all of her team mates were very supportive when she was ill . She has now made a full recovery and is back on the hockey pitch as well as working as a professional photographer . ‘I was warned that although I would probably walk again, I may never recover enough strength to be able to play sport. ‘I was absolutely devastated. Playing sport is who I am, and I was determined I wasn't going to be beaten.’ After leaving hospital, Ms Muir was admitted to a rehabilitation unit, where she began daily physiotherapy. For six months she had to visit the hospital regularly for follow-up treatment. Just a year after being hospitalised, Ms Muir graduated with first class honours in photography . Lucky: One in five people never fully recover from Guillain-Barre syndrome . She returned to university that autumn using a wheelchair, and slowly relied on it less and less. However, it was 18 months before she could do away with the chair altogether. Just a year after being struck down with the illness, she graduated with first class honours - and has since started work as a professional photographer. She added: ‘I learned to walk slowly within a few months, but it has taken a really long time and a long of physiotherapy to get me back to my old self. ‘I finally feel like me again.’","Nicola Muir was struck down with Guillain-Barre syndrome as a student .

"By . Emily Allen . Created 2:05 PM on 8th September 2011 . A dazed inventor was found outside his home in blackened underpants after his attempt at making vodka went badly wrong - and he blew up his home. Lawrence Toms, 43, was tinkering with his vodka distillation equipment in his bedroom when neighbours suddenly heard a massive blast, which blew out the windows and the roof of his home. Ten neighbouring houses had to be evacuated before Mr Toms found wandering in his blackened underwear in the street. Damage: Lawrence Toms was tinkering with his vodka distillation equipment when the blast occurred blowing out the windows and the roof of his home which is currently boarded up while windows are replaced . Home-brewing: Lawrence Toms was trying to make vodka in his bedroom when the experiment went wrong . Police were today investigating the explosion and the home brewing apparatus was taken away for examination. Neighbours said Mr Toms had been making vodka at his home after downloading a recipe and instructions from the internet. Next-door neighbour Gavin Rees, 28, said: 'I'd just put my five-year-old to bed when I heard a massive explosion. 'I looked out of the window and saw my neighbour in the street in his boxers and shorts with all his skin burnt off his arms. 'I took him in and ran his burns under the tap until the paramedics took him away.' Four fire engines and an ambulance were called to the terraced street in the village of Treherbert, Rhondda, South Wales. Fire fighters battled to control the blaze while Mr Toms was taken to a specialist burns unit. Hannah Knowles, 63, who lives opposite, said: 'I was just settling down to watch Coronation Street with a cup of tea when I heard a huge bang. 'I looked out the window and saw giant jets of flame shooting out of the roof of Mr Tom's house. I've never seen anything like it. 'His windows were blown out but luckily for me his camper van was parked outside and that shielded me from the blast.' Mr Toms, a graduate of St Mary's University, London, runs his own company called Real Cool Futures. One of his products is making gift paper and stationery from sheep droppings which has been presented to Prince Charles. Explosion: Four fire engines and an ambulance were called to the terraced street to put out the blaze. The blackened windows, smoke stained room and damaged roof can be seen . In 2006 he won a £20,000 Millennium Award for 'social entrepreneurship'. But neighbours believe he was experimenting by making full-strength vodka using distillation apparatus which he had built in a bedroom. Neighbour Susan Minty, 52, said: 'He was definitely old enough to know better - he's going to wake up with one hell of a hangover. 'It's crazy, you don't go making something like that in a terrance street especially when there's lots of kids about. 'The firefighters told us we were lucky the whole street didn't go up.' Mr Toms was yesterday being treated at Morriston Hospital in Swansea where he was described as 'stable'. South Wales Police said they believe that the explosion was caused by home-made alcohol. 'The windows were blown out of the property and it was lucky no one in the street was injured.' 'We believe the explosion was triggered by a home brewing kit. 'It's not a criminal offence to brew your own alcohol for private use, unless it's being carried out without licence for commercial benefit. 'But officers are satisfied he was making it for his own consumption and this was not a commercial operation.' Instructions available on the internet say: 'Distillation is best done somewhere other than your house for safety considerations. 'Distillation apparatuses are heated by open flames and other means that can cause bodily injury and result in explosions, especially due to the flammable nature of alcohol. 'Leaks in a still or any situation where alcohol or alcohol vapour may end up exposed to flame, can very likely lead to explosion and fire.'","10 houses evacuated in South Wales village .

If your muscles start swelling to superhero proportions after your next sushi meal, this might be why. Researchers from Stony Brook University in New York have discovered bluefin tuna are carrying radioactive contamination leaked from Japan's crippled nuclear plant all the way across the Pacific to the United States, 6,000 miles away. This is the first time a huge migrating fish has been shown to carry radioactivity such a distance, as they generally metabolise the contamination during their journey. Radioactive: Scientists said the increased radiation found in the Pacific bluefin tuna came from Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant that was crippled by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami . Nuclear: The Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant, pictured, was badly damaged in the 2011 earthquake and tsunami leading to a higher level of contamination in tuna . 'We were frankly kind of startled,' said researcher Nicholas Fisher, who reported the findings on Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The levels of contamination were 10 times higher than the amount measured in tuna off the California coast in previous years. But even so, it's still far below safe-to-eat limits set by the U.S. and Japanese governments, so is unlikely to affect humans. Since the March 2011 earthquake and subsequent tsunami that badly damaged the Fukushima Dai-ichi reactors, smaller fish and plankton have been found with elevated levels of radiation in Japanese waters. Prized: Sushi chef Kiyoshi Kimura poses next to a 269 kilogram bluefin tuna, which can fetch $24 for a thin slice at top Tokyo restaurants . But scientists did not expect the nuclear fallout to linger in huge fish such as bluefin tuna, which grow to 10 feet and weigh over 1,000 pounds. This is because they generally shed radioactive substances easily, metabolising it as they sail the world. The tuna captured off the California coast were contaminated with radioactive material from the Fukushima meltdown of March last year. When an earthquake and tsunami struck Japan, they overwhelmed the defences of the Dai-Ichi power plant, leading to the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl. Dangerous amounts of radioactive material were carried by wind away from the plant, which is just 30 miles from the Pacific Ocean. When those substances - such as isotopes caesium-134 and caesium-137 - entered the water, they also entered the food chain and living environment of fish such as tuna. The face that the radioactive caesium has stayed in the tuna's system a year later, even after a 6,000-mile swim across the ocean, shows just how much of the isotope was released by the meltdown. While scientists claim that the fish is currently safe to eat, many of the effects of radioactivity on the human body are still unknown. Five months after the Fukushima disaster, Fisher and his team decided to test Pacific bluefin, that spawn off the coast of Japan and swim east to California and Mexico. To their surprise, tissue samples from all 15 tuna captured off the San Diego coast contained levels of two radioactive substances - caesium-134 and caesium-137 - that were higher than in previous catches. The scientists also analysed yellowfin tuna, found in the eastern Pacific, and bluefin that migrated to Southern California before the nuclear crisis, to rule out any other causes for the enhanced radiation, such as ocean currents. They found no trace of caesium-134 and only background levels of caesium-137 left over from nuclear weapons testing in the 1960s. The results 'are unequivocal. Fukushima was the source,' said Ken Buesseler of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Bluefin tuna absorbed radioactive caesium from swimming in contaminated waters and feeding on contaminated prey such as krill and squid, the scientists said. As the predators made the journey east, they shed some of the radiation through metabolism and as they grew larger. Even so, they weren't able to completely flush out all the radioactivity from their system. 'That's a big ocean. To swim across it and still retain these radionuclides is pretty amazing,' Fisher said. Debris: Radioactive tuna is not the only casualty of the tsunami to wash up in North America, as this motorbike which found its way from Japan to Canada proves . Can I have my ball back, please? Another Japanese visitor to the U.S. is a football owned by Misaki Murakami, left, and found by David Baxter, right, on a beach in Alaska . Pacific bluefin tuna are prized in Japan where a thin slice of the tender red meat prepared as sushi can fetch $24 per piece at top Tokyo restaurants. Japan consumes 80 per cent of the world's Pacific and Atlantic bluefin tuna. But researchers say the real test of how radioactivity affects tuna populations comes this summer when they plan to repeat the study with a larger number of samples. Bluefin tuna that journeyed last year were exposed to radiation for about a month but the upcoming travelers have been swimming in radioactive waters for a longer period. They are also keen to track the movements of other migratory species including sea turtles, sharks and seabirds, now they know bluefin tuna can transport radiation.","Pacific tuna has radiation levels 10 times higher than normal .

For 12 year-old Zara each tentative, nervous, deliberate movement of her feet was a step into the unknown. Three months ago she had been unable to walk at all and faced a desperate future in Afghanistan with little prospect of help or ever being able to marry and raise a family because she was born with the deformity of bilateral clubbed feet. But today supported gently and encouraged in each step by British aid worker Kate Rowlands she was able to walk around a rose-lined garden in a suburb of the Afghan capital Kabul before resting on the seat of a swing watched with delight by her mother Latifa. Inspirational: British aid worker Kate Rowlands . pictured with some of the disabled Afghan children she has been helping at The . Childrens House, a charity bringing medical treatment to the country's . poorest youngsters . Legacy: The work of Children's House is being supported by foundations set up in memory of Linda Norgrove, left, 36, who was kidnapped by the Taliban and killed in October 2010 as U.S. Special Forces tried to rescue her, and Dr Karen Woo, right, also 36, who was shot dead months earlier in an attack still shrouded in mystery . ‘To us this is a miracle, a gift of . life…a return to the type of life everyone should be able to live,’ the . smiling 29 year-old mother-of-five said. ‘We did not think that she . would ever be able to walk freely like this – and on her own.’ The . words ‘miracle’ and ‘gift of life’ are regularly used by the families . of some 35 Afghan youngsters receiving treatment at The Children’s . House, a French-run project in Kabul, that provides surgery, medical . care and a peaceful sanctuary during recovery for patients and their . families from all over Afghanistan. It . is a remarkable and inspirational project which is being backed by . foundations set-up in the memory of two equally remarkable and . inspirational British women killed while they tried to help the women . and children in the most impoverished areas of rural Afghanistan. Help: Ms Rowlands sits with, from left, . Rohullah, 13, a heart surgery patient, Zara, 12, who suffered from club . feet, and Enjillah, 13, a spinal surgery patient, all of whose . treatments were paid for by the Woo Foundation . So . far the treatment and care for Zara and 14 other children have been . paid for by grants from the Karen Woo Foundation established in memory . of the 36 year-old doctor, from Stevenage, Herts, who was kidnapped and . murdered in August 2010 in the remote mountainous Badakshan Province to . the north east of the war ravaged country. A . former dancer and model, Dr Woo, who specialised in providing maternal . and neonatal care, was on her third visit to Afghanistan when she and . nine other aid workers were ambushed in an attack initially blamed on . the Taliban but still shrouded in mystery. A . further eight of the children are being helped thanks to the financial . backing provided by the Linda Norgrove Foundation set-up in memory of . the 36 year-old Scottish aid worker, who died in October 2010 in a . failed pre-dawn rescue by US Special Forces after being kidnapped by the . Taliban in Kunar Province, eastern Afghanistan. Finding her feet: Zara has had three operations to correct her club feet to enable her to walk for the first time. Doctors expect that within six months she will be able to walk freely without pain or difficulties . ‘It is so very sad what happened to . two special women who were doing so much to help the people of . Afghanistan but I am sure they would have been pleased that part of . their legacy would be they were continuing to help the children, women . and families of this country,’ said Ms Rowlands, Project Coordinator for . Le Chaine de l’espoir, the organisation behind The Children’s House. The 57-year-old, from Conwy, North . Wales, continued : ‘When Karen came here she would play with the . children, they loved her and there was a bond – the rural children were . very close to her and Linda’s hearts ... they helped so many of them in . so many ways. ‘Both were . caring young women who gave so much to improve these little people’s . lives and I am sure they would have been very proud of what is being . done in their names. ‘While . it is incredibly sad these foundations exist because both girls have . died, we are delighted their families have the confidence in us and in . our work to back us.  Their support is changing lives immeasurably for . the better, the success in each individual case provides hope for . others.’ Bright eyes: Eighteen-month-old Samir is seen here prior to surgery to correct his cleft palate . Massive change: Samir in the sunshine in the garden of Children's House following the surgery . Transformation: Eight month-old Abil pictured before and after surgery to correct his cleft lip and palate . Sheltering in a tented area from the . baking sun with his mother, eight month-old Abil, who underwent an . operation for a cleft lip, is one of those currently being helped by the . Woo Foundation, set-up by the doctor’s mother and friends to support . projects dear to her heart. While . the transformation in 13 year-old Rohullah (open heart surgery) and . Enjillah (deformity of the spine), has been so great that both were able . to sit happily on swings in the walled garden of the project’s . headquarters tucked away off a crowded Kabul street and the very real . threat of the Taliban’s now regular brutal attacks on their targets in . the capital. Zara has so far . undergone three operations to correct her clubbed feet and doctors . expect that within six months she will be able to walk freely without . pain or difficulties – something her family believes will inspire others . among what they call ‘the forgotten, abandoned people’ living in the . harsh often desperate rural communities to seek help. Easily treated: Seven-month-old Esanllah pictured as she arrived at Children's House, before undergoing surgery to correct her cleft palate . Some . have travelled for days to reach the sanctuary that is The Children . House - one youngster undertook a journey that began with him being . carried on a relative’s back before he was placed in a wooden cart and . then transferred to travel through the hills on the back of a donkey. Bus and car saw him reach Kabul after nearly four days. It is a journey . he has now made three times but thanks to the medical teams here and . their expertise to correct his twisted legs, he no longer needs to be . carried by a relative. ‘Karen and Linda would have been . pleased that the work done here has spread rapidly by word of mouth so . that we are being approached for help from throughout Afghanistan,’ said . Ms Rowlands, who has worked in Afghanistan over two decades as well as . with other humanitarian crisis points such as Iraq and Rwanda while . overseeing a project backing schools for girls in the Panshir Valley, . near the Hindu Kush mountain range, some 100 miles north of Kabul. ‘Even . in the most distant, remote border areas where there are no such things . as telephones  families are hearing of us and the fact that we provide . both medical and after care thanks to the support we receive from the . charities. ‘Around 100 news . cases a month are being helped with their lives changed forever for the . better and much of it is thanks to the legacy of Karen and Linda.’ New life: Esanllah with her mother in the garden of Children's House after successful surgery to treat her . Miss Norgrove’s parents John and Lorna . travelled to Kabul earlier this year to witnesses how children were . being helped and yesterday seven month-old Esanllah, recovering from . surgery to a cleft lip and palate, and Ferous, nine, whose twisted . deformity of the legs has been corrected, were preparing with members of . their families to leave after work paid for by the foundation. ‘The . foundations have been able to help specific children – we see a lot of . club feet, heart problems, curvature of the spine and cleft palate and . lips – and their work makes a huge difference,’ Ms Rowlands said. ‘In . days gone by these children would have died or if they had survived, . their quality of life would have been very much compromised or they . would have been outcasts. ‘It . is very difficult for people in Britain to quite understand how remote . these people are from the kind of health care which we see as part of . our fabric of life. There is no such thing here, there is a lack of . education, lack of health care and poverty ... so for children like . these, unless we help and provide treatment, the future is not good ... it is very bleak.’ Standing tall: Nine-year-old Ferous pictured at Children's House before and after surgery to correct his twisted deformity of the legs that was paid for by the foundation set up in memory of Miss Norgrove . She added : ‘The perception of Afghanistan is that it is all bad news and that makes me crazy because in places like this (Children’s House), there is so much good and positive news.’ Latifa agreed : ‘It is wonderful what . has happened to Zara – she has had surgery three times – and is now . happy that she can walk. She is looking forward so that one day she too . can play and live like other girls. ‘To . the people of the Karen Woo Foundation I would say thank you for . changing lives, for helping the children of Afghanistan and thank you . personally for helping my child. You have made me proud’ A chance to smile: Thanks to their treatments Enjillah and Zara now have hope of overcoming their disabilities . They are heartfelt words that may provide some comfort and pride to the family of Dr Woo – words echoed elsewhere across the Afghan capital by those they are helping at The Childlight Foundation which provides vital equipment for orphanages, holds educational seminars for women and provides clothing, books and other much needed supplies to women’s prisons . Donations to help those at The Children’s House can be made by visiting the websites of the Woo Foundation, the Norgrove Foundation and the The French Medical Institute For Children.","Foundations set up in memory of murdered British aid workers Karen Woo and Linda Norgrove are supporting the treatment of disabled youngsters .

Postman: John Bircham (pictured in 1987) was a prolific striker for amateur side Dulverton Town FC . This is the first picture of a 57-year-old postman who died while completing his rounds in thick snow on Exmoor while trying to push his Royal Mail van after it became stuck in a snowdrift. John Bircham, who had been a postman since the late 1980s, collapsed as he battled the snow and icy conditions at the end of his deliveries in and around Dulverton, Somerset, on Saturday. The father of two - who was once a prolific striker for local amateur side Dulverton Town Football Club in the 1970s - was towed out of a snowdrift by a farmer before soon collapsing. Friends paid tribute today to the ‘quiet, friendly’ father of sons Wayne and Jamie, who had lived in Dulverton all his life and well-liked in the town. School friend John Atkins, secretary for the the Taunton & District Saturday Football League club, said a tribute would be held by the team to Mr Bircham, whom he described as a keen sportsman and a credit to his community. He said: ‘As a footballer, John was as tough as nails - players used to bounce off him. But he was very gentle. There was never any nastiness in his play. If someone tried to tackle him, he'd just laugh. He was a very skilful player. 'I'm not being critical to our other former players, but John was one of the few who put something back into the club when he finished playing. 'He would turn up to watch and sell tickets for the club draw. He actually sold more tickets than anyone this year, so it was a very popular thing indeed when John's name was drawn first out of the hat to win the £100 first prize.’ Scene: The road to Oldways End where John Bircham's post van became stuck in the snow before he died . The town council’s vice-chairman Ian Fleming said Mr Bircham was ‘held in high regard’ in Dulverton and ‘people would often see him with his grandchildren, happy and smiling’. Mr Fleming added: ‘He did a lot for the people of this town and the surrounding area. John really did go to great lengths for people, not just with his deliveries. He was a real family man.’ Prolific striker: John Bircham, pictured in his playing days for Dulverton Town FC in the 1970s, was described by the club secretary as 'tough as nails' Royal Mail last night confirmed Mr Bircham's death and paid tribute to his 25 years' service. Dulverton sub-postmaster Chris Dubery said: ‘He was as hard-working a person as you'll ever meet, very dedicated to his collections and to the people of this town. He was a very quiet man, and the customers loved him. ‘He was very considerate towards them, always helping them out. He will be missed.’ Chris Nelder, a Dulverton town councillor, said: ‘This has come as quite a shock and news of Mr Bircham’s death has obviously spread very quickly through the area where he was very well known. ‘He was delivering out towards East Anstey and as I understand it was stuck in a snowdrift and was unable to get any traction on the tyres of his van. ‘A farmer who was out in his tractor came to his aid and had offered to tow him out but despite his best efforts and the first responder locally and the air ambulance Mr Bircham couldn’t be revived. ‘He was Dulverton born and bred and had had a delivery round in and around the town for 25 years so he knew an awful lot of people and they knew him even if only by sight travelling around the lanes.’ Picturesque: A winter scene at the weekend on Exmoor as a 4x4 vehicle passes near Simonsbath, Somerset . A local Post Office source said: ‘I think . the road was blocked by a fallen tree and Mr Bircham was trying to get . round it when he got stuck in a drift. ‘He was trying to clear the snow from . under his back wheels to reverse out and go back down the lane. As usual . he was doing his utmost to make sure the post got through.’ Local office: Royal Mail last night confirmed Mr Bircham's death and paid tribute to his 25 years' service. Dulverton Post Office is pictured . Last night, Mr Bircham’s widow, Wendy, was being comforted by the couple’s two sons. She was said to be too upset to talk.’ Brian Edworthy, Mr Bircham’s brother-in-law, said: ‘She would like to be left alone at this difficult time.’ Another family source added yesterday: ‘At the moment it is still not clear why John died. We are awaiting the results of a post mortem and for the body to be released. ‘Until then we won’t know what the precise cause of death was. We are assuming it was probably some sort of heart attack but we are not sure and we really don’t know if it was due to the circumstances he found himself in with his van. ‘John was stuck in the snow and had been digging around but the farmer who went to his aid didn’t report him being red faced and sweating or puffing and panting or anything like that. ‘He offered to pull John out after he had only been digging for a short while but before he could climb back into the driver’s seat to be towed out he just slid down the wing of the car and onto the ground. ‘The farmer attempted to resuscitate him together with another farm worker who came out but when the worker checked they could not seem to get any pulse. When the paramedics arrived it was the same. It was too late.’","John Bircham, of Dulverton, Somerset, had been postman since late 1980s .

Targeted: Candace Bushnell has been hacked by the cyber-attacker 'Guccifer' who leaked details of her new novel online . Candace Bushnell has become the latest victim of the 'Guccifer' hacker after details of her new novel, apparently called 'Killing Monica', were posted online. The Sex and the City writer was targeted last night when the first page of her book was posted and a series of frantic messages appeared on her Twitter account. Ms Bushnell, 54, is the latest high profile figure to be hacked by the anonymous cyber-attacker, who has previously targeted George W. Bush Snr, Colin Powell and a former aide to Bill Clinton. The hacker is said to have got into her personal computer, taken over her webpage and Twitter account and posted a link to documents showing her new book. The Tweet said: 'Here you can read my last book 'killing monica' first 50 pages, enjoy'. Then Guccifer uploaded emails from the author to her publisher showing distress at the fact her Twitter account had been hacked. The frantic emails between the author and her publisher, in which Bushnell writes, 'Oh dear, this is terrible,' were tweeted in screenshot form as well. The messages revealing the first 37,000 words of Bushnell’s next novel via screen grabs posted to Google Drive have since been removed from Bushnell's feed. In an interview posted on The Smoking Gun, Bushnell said that her e-mail and Twitter accounts were broken into yesterday, and that she had no idea how they were breached. She added that a simultaneous attempt was made to compromise her Facebook account, but that she received an alert that someone was attempting to access it from an IP address in Albuquerque, New Mexico that was not recognized by the social networking firm. She told the site: 'Yesterday I woke up and I couldn’t get my e-mails', and added that she had to repeatedly change her password while tussling with the hacker for control of the account. Under attack: Candace Bushnell's personal site was taken over by hacker 'Guccifer' who posted a link to page from her new novel . The hacker has previously targeted political heavyweights like former President George W. Bush and his former Secretary of State Colin Powell has a new victim but this time from the other side of the aisle. A close confidante of both former . President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has . been added as the latest victim of a hacker who goes by the name . 'Guccifer'. Sidney . Blumenthal's email was allegedly hacked sometime this week and Guccifer . was able to obtain email correspondence between Blumenthal and Mrs . Clinton. It is unclear what . exactly the hacker was looking for or how many emails he was able to . obtain, but the data in Mr Blumenthal's breached AOL account dates back . to 2005. Close connections: Sidney Blumenthal (right) was an aide to Bill Clinton when he was President, and now Blumenthal was the latest victim in a series of politically-targeted hacks . The other Clinton: The hacker may have been targeting emails Blumenthal exchanged with Hillary Clinton when she served as Secretary of State from 2009 to earlier this year . The timeline means that it is unlikely that any memos that Blumenthal sent to Clinton when he worked as a close advisor in the late 1990s and early 2000s were part of the hacked data. Though Mr Clinton was out of the White House by 2000, he stayed in touch with the powerful couple up to present day. Mr Blumenthal told The Smoking Gun that he only realized something was awry with his account when he could not log in Thursday morning. Other targets: Former Secretary of State Colin Powell (left) had his Facebook account hacked and emails sent by former President George Bush's relatives (right) were also breached . To outside observers, Mr Blumenthal seems like an odd target because his theorettical political heyday occurred when Mr Clinton was in the White House. In that wake it appears the hacker was looking for information exchanged with Mrs Clinton while she was in the post of Secretary of State from 2009 to earlier this year. That theory also fits the trend that the hacker's interest stem from a possible conspiracy theory or issue stemming to foreign relations. Other targets have included Senator Lisa Murkowski, former United Nations ambassador John Negroponte and unidentified members of the famed Rockefeller family. Republican General Powell had his Facebook page broken into and created several posts. Offensive: One of the bizarre posts made by the hacker included this one which read: 'You will burn in hell, Bush!' Bizarre: The hacker posted a series of rants on General Powell's page as well as a series of photos which are believed to have been taken from former President George W Bush's hacked email account . Apology: General Powell described the hacker's posts as 'stupid' and 'obscene' on his page yesterday . One post read: 'You will burn in hell, Bush!' In another bizarre post, the hacker ranted: 'Kill the illuminati! Tomorrow’s world will be a world free of illuminati or will be no more!' As well as the offensive posts, some of which insulted Powell himself, pictures were uploaded to Powell's Facebook page showing screen grabs of the hacker's previous access to email accounts of Mr Bush and his siblings Neil and Dorothy.","Sex And The City writer had 50 pages of 'Killing Monica' novel posted online .

Autopsies determined that all three died of carbon monoxide poisoning, possibly caused by the vehicle's tailpipe being submerged in mud. The move to cancel the show came on the heels of Gandee’s funeral Sunday, during which hundreds of camouflage-clad friends and fans gathered to honor the life of MTV’s newest breakout star. TMZ reported that producers did not cite any specific reason for the cancellation of the show. MTV is expected to make an official announcement later in the day Wednesday.

Power couple: Former Labour culture secretary Tessa Jowell with her tax lawyer husband David Mills . She separated from her husband after he was accused of taking a bribe from Silvio Berlusconi – but yesterday Dame Tessa Jowell admitted that the couple were reconciled. The former Labour culture secretary and her wealthy tax lawyer husband David Mills parted in 2006. Although they never divorced, the former marital home in Kentish Town, north London, was sold. Dame Tessa moved to a swish new home in Highgate while Mills remained in their country spread in Warwickshire. Breaking her silence about her marital woes for the first time, Dame Tessa, 65, said that parting from Mills, her second husband, broke her heart. And she robustly denied suggestions that she had ditched her marriage for the sake of her career in government. In a radio interview she said: ‘What mother is prepared to look her children in the eye and say: “We are splitting up. But, you know what? It’s not real.”’ Her decision to speak out publicly about the split comes just days after she announced she was standing down from frontline politics with her departure from the shadow cabinet. She received a damehood in the Queen’s Birthday Honours. An old friend of the Labour MP said: ‘It seems unlikely that the two events were not connected. I’m sure she wants to unburden herself now that she’s going to become more of a private citizen.’ Explaining the background to the split, when Mills found himself engulfed in Italian bribery allegations, Dame Tessa told Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour: ‘He reached the view that life was intolerable while we were together and, as he put it to me: “You’re my problem, I’m you’re problem” and we separated. It broke my heart.’ Of their new life, she said: ‘David has his house in the country and I have my house. We see each other regularly and we have time together which I really treasure as a family. We have reached a state of stability which I never thought possible.’ Influential: Tessa Jowell, pictured with former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, and her husband both shared successful careers and high-profile contacts . Controversial: Lawyer David Mills was accused of taking a bribe from Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi . The couple have been spotted walking hand in hand near Mills’ country home. Dame Tessa and Mills were often portrayed as the epitome of a successful New Labour couple. A . high-flying minister and a wealthy international lawyer, they shared . successful careers and contacts at the highest levels, both in politics . and business. They were close to Tony Blair. But . following weeks of unwelcome media interest in Mills’ business links to . former Italian prime minister Berlusconi, the couple separated. Mills was found guilty of accepting a £350,000 bribe in return for providing false testimony for Berlusconi in two corruption trials concerning the Italian’s time as a businessman. The conviction was later thrown out on a technicality. Key role: Tessa Jowell, pictured nest to the chairman of the London 2012 Olympic committee Sebastian Coe, right, the then Mayor of London Ken Livingsone and chief exec of IOL, helped bring the Olympics to London . Continued support: Tessa Jowell, pictured with Prince Harry, Catherine the Duchess of Cambridge and Mayor of the Olympic Village Sir Charles Allen, continued on the Olympic project even after Labour lost the election . In her interview Dame Tessa also . re-affirmed her belief in Mills, who is now semi-retired and writing . novels, saying: ‘My husband never took a bribe, never acted in any kind . of corrupt way as subsequent judgments have made clear. He was . effectively exonerated.’ When . challenged by presenter Jane Garvey that he had actually been heavily . fined by the Italian courts, she replied: ‘The byzantine nature of . Italian justice is something that is very hard to explain.' Loving couple: Tessa Jowell admitted that separating from David Mills broke her heart . Dame . Tessa was one of the key figures in bringing the Olympic Games to . London at the time her husband was protesting his innocence. She . remained close to the project even after Labour lost the 2010 election. While not subjected to the boos that . greeted Chancellor George Osborne during the Paralympics, she was met by . groans from the crowd when she presented medals. Describing why they separated she . said: ‘We had three very difficult years before [the accusations] and . three very difficult years after that.’ Last night Mills said: ‘I never comment on my private life but whatever Tessa has said is true.’ In . a statement in 2009 after her husband was found guilty of accepting the . bribe, Dame Tessa said: ‘This is a terrible blow to David and, although . we are separated, I have never doubted his innocence.’ She . was dragged into her husband’s controversial financial affairs in 2006 . when it emerged that she had signed papers for a loan secured on their . London home – which was subsequently paid off with the help of the . alleged bribe. The . couple announced their split days later after it emerged that Mills had . used his wife’s Cabinet position and his friendship with Mr Blair to . fight the corruption allegations in a letter to financial authorities in . Dubai. She insisted that she did not know about the money until four years later. An . inquiry by Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus O’Donnell found that she should . have declared the payment but Mr Blair, who was then still prime . minister, cleared her of any wrongdoing.","Former Labour culture secretary Tessa Jowell split up with her tax lawyer husband David Mills in 2006 .

Magnificoes, present and past, paraded at St Paul’s. We saw faces once familiar, now sunken and lined. This was Thatcherdom’s (as opposed to Thatcherism’s) last hurrah. Loyal to the last: Norman Tebbit (left) had sided with Mrs Thatcher against the rebels. Right, Lord Carrington . A stooped Geoffrey Howe and his ever-attendant Elspeth, a bespectacled Heseltine. Was there something lonely behind the old assassin’s eyes? But he was right to attend. Unthawed Kinnock didn’t. Douglas Hurd, nobly scarecrowish, braved his fraility to show respects to the woman he served as Home Secretary and more. Trade ace Lord Young, her problem solver, was loyal to the end. He sat near Tom King, who as Northern Ireland Secretary was with her at Hillsborough Castle in 1985. The front row went to the Queen and gallant Prince Philip.

Now there is a Labour lady who knows how to behave. Beethoven’s funeral dirge came blowing up Ludgate Hill, through the cathedral’s great west door, right down the waiting congregation’s spine. The military spectacle was immense in its precision. Colonel Hugh Bodington, officer commanding, had done his stuff. The pallbearers reached the top of the cathedral steps and in that very instant all living ambition was subdued.

Between them was Poland’s Lech ‘Solidarity’ Walesa, who with Mrs T did much to undo the Soviet empire. If anyone doubted Margaret Thatcher’s global reach, here was proof. Mr Walesa can be excused not singing along to I Vow To Thee, My Country. Which of us would be able to belt out Zeby Polska Byla Polska? Former U.S. vice-president Dick Cheney looked unfamiliar with the tune to Love Divine, but he may just be a grunter. Every congregation has a few. Was that Henry Kissinger’s singing voice or was it the mighty St Paul’s organ parping its bottom bass B? Hard to say. White South Africa’s F. W. de Klerk was chewing something. Gum? Biltong? Canada’s ex-PM, Brian Mulroney, was there for the Senior Dominion. Still smooth: Ex-cabinet minister Cecil Parkinson as he arrived at St Paul's Cathedral . Alongside these world names were domestic political egos of old. Sometime Energy Minister Tim Eggar looked distrait. David Mellor made sure he was noticed. Francis Maude, still in the game but originally a Thatcher boy, pushed away a tear. Charles Powell, always drawn to feisty women, seemed to be acting as walker to the Duchess of York. Tim Renton, Mrs T’s last (not entirely strong) Chief Whip, was in the body of the kirk. Euro man: Leon Brittan (left) and long-serving cabinet minister Nigel Lawson (right) That stoical walnut Lord Tebbit lent enthusiastic voice during Bunyan’s To Be A Pilgrim, but when it came to the part ‘there’s no discouragement’ was he perhaps tempted to tweak it to ‘would make her once relent’? The event had drawn not only her own side, such as ‘Wee Free’ former Lord Chancellor James Mackay, once-dashing Jonathan Aitken and Sir Bernard Ingham with his eyebrows. Now there’s a test for any Black and Decker hedge trimmer. Mourners had come from other parties, too. David Steel and David Owen, the one-time Alliance duo who in their own way helped Mrs T stay in power, were next to one another, paired for perpetuity.

The Archbishop of Canterbury, whose crisp sign of the Cross has something of a window cleaner reaching into every last crevice, gave his blessing. ‘The fever of life is over.’ Those stalwart lads in Garrison Sgt-Major Mott’s bearer party marched back up the nave and resumed their burden.

Yesterday the 13,000mph aircraft of the future took off for a crucial test flight. Within hours however, the Falcon Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2 appeared to have failed the test. Falcon HTV-2: The aircraft can travel at 20 times the speed of sound - or 13,000mph. It is part of research effort by DARPA to one day make long-duration hypersonic flight a reality . On the ground: This photo from Vandenberg Air Force Base shows a Minotaur IV rocket standing beside Space Launch Complex-8 in California, which the hypersonic glider was due to launch from . Epic: The mission might lead to new records, super weapons and eventually, cross-country and global travel at colossal speeds. The aircraft is unmanned, rocket-launched and manoeuvrable . Name: Falcon HTV-2 . Mission: To provide the U.S. Military with its first in a new generation of sub-orbital weaons. Top speed: 13,000mph or Mach 22. A MiG-25 can typically reach Mach 2.3, or 1,520mph . Length: 12ft long . Weight: 900kg . Materials: Made of experimental material that can withstand up to 3,500f (2000C) it will experience upon re-entry. Cost: $308million (£189million), so far . Payload: Potentially anything up to 12,000lbs, including a nuclear bomb. Range: Anywhere in the world in less than 60 minutes . It was launched from a Californian . rocket pad to the edge of space and was due to glide back down to Earth . at roughly four miles per second. But all contact was lost and the craft was thought to have crashed. It was a cruel anti-climax after all the hype, and a case of back to the drawing board for its developers at the Pentagon. The project is being run in . conjunction with America's Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency as . part of research into a new generation of weapons. But while the Pentagon is more . interested in it as a weapon with the potential to strike rogue states . anywhere on Earth in under 60 minutes, its scope for commercial travel . could be immense. The Falcon, which is unmanned, lifted off from Vandenberg Air Force Base on board an Air Force Minotaur IV rocket. This took the HTV-2 to the edge of the atmosphere. The rocket carrying the Falcon will take off on Thursday, weather permitting, after originally being planned for Wednesday . After it separated from the rocket, it was supposed to glide over the Pacific at up to 20 times the speed of sound. The take-off went well but contact was lost with the craft at the glide phase. The Falcon reaches such a high speed . partly because of its own weight descending through Earth's atmosphere, . but also because of the experimental engines on board which are designed . to run at extreme velocities. Last night marked its second mission. The first had to be aborted last year after its onboard systems detected a fault.","Aircraft would take 12 minutes to fly from New York to Los Angeles .

Facebook is in 'advanced talks' to buy satnav software firm Waze - but could be outbid by Apple at the last minute, it has been claimed. The social network is believed to be in advanced talks to acquire Israeli mobile satellite navigation start-up Waze for $800 million to $1 billion. However, experts say Apple is also interested in using the software to bolster its Maps app - and could step in with a last minute bid. Waze uses satellite signals from members' smartphones to 'crowdsource' maps and traffic data, and can run on Apple or Android handsets and tablets . Waze uses satellite signals from members' smartphones to generate maps . and traffic data, which it then shares with other users, offering . real-time traffic info. Due diligence on a deal is already underway, Israeli business blog Calcalist said, claiming that talks began six months ago. Officials at Waze declined to comment on the report. The Facebook overture is more serious than the Apple one, it has been claimed. 'You could term the interaction between Waze and Apple as a series of ‘dates,’ whereas this seems more like an ‘engagement.’ 'The deal makes a lot of sense for Facebook, and of course Waze would be getting a lot more money,” according to a ZDNet source. Pondering a purchase: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is believed to have offered $1bn to buy satnav firm Waze . The Waze software shows other users nearby as it guides users, who can also report problems which are shared with all users . Waze and Facebook partnered in October 2012 when Waze released its updated version that allows users to share their drive with their Facebook friends. If it goes ahead, the deal  would be Facebook's third acquisition in Israel. It bought photo sharing app Snaptu in 2011 for $70 million and facial recognition firm  Face.com in 2012 for $60 million. In the last year, Waze tripled its user base to 45 million and in March alone, 1.5 million users downloaded the free mobile navigation app, Calcalist said.","Facebook in 'advanced talks' with Israeli firm .

Images beamed back from Nasa's Cassini spacecraft have revealed meteors smashing into Saturn's rings for the first time. They make Saturn's rings the only location besides the Earth, the moon and Jupiter where scientists have been able to observe impacts as they occur. Measuring from one centimetre to several metres across, the objects break into streams of rubble as they 'pummel' the planet before kicking up clouds of debris, Nasa scientists said. Saturn's rings: The arrows indicate the clouds kicked up by the impact of the meteors. Measuring from one centimetre to several metres across, the objects break into streams of rubble as they 'pummel' the planet before kicking up clouds of debris, Nasa scientists said . Scientists believe the meteoroids . break up into streams of rubble upon hitting Saturn's rings, creating . smaller, slower pieces that enter into orbit around the planet. The impact of these secondary meteoroid bits kicks up the clouds, which are quickly pulled into bright, diagonal streaks. Studying the impact rate of . meteoroids from outside the Saturnian system helps its scientists to . understand how different planet systems in our solar system formed, Nasa said. The solar system is full of small, speeding objects which frequently pummel planetary bodies. It took scientists years to distinguish the tracks left by nine meteoroids in 2005, 2009 and 2012. Results from Cassini have already shown Saturn's rings act as effective detectors of many kinds of surrounding phenomena, including the interior structure of the planet and the orbits of its moons. For example, a subtle but extensive corrugation that ripples 12,000 miles across the innermost rings tells of a very large meteoroid impact in 1983. Impact: Saturn's rings are bombarded with small, speeding meteroids that break upon impact and enter into orbit around the planet . Shearing: This illustration shows how the cloud of debris is initially circular, but then shears as a result of the particles in the cloud having differing orbital speeds around Saturn . Speeding: The meteoroids Cassini detected crashing into Saturn's rings are comparable in size to this one pictured hurtling over Russia in February . 'These new results imply the current-day impact rates for small particles at Saturn are about the same as those at Earth - two very different neighborhoods in our solar system - and this is exciting to see,' said Linda Spilker, Cassini project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. 'It took Saturn's rings acting like a giant meteoroid detector - 100 times the surface area of the Earth - and Cassini's long-term tour of the Saturn system to address this question.' Conditions were especially good for viewing the debris left by meteoroid impacts during the Saturnian equinox in the summer of 2009, when the very shallow sun angle on the rings caused the clouds of debris to look bright against the darkened rings in pictures from Cassini's imaging science subsystem. 'We knew these little impacts were constantly occurring, but we didn't know how big or how frequent they might be, and we didn't necessarily expect them to take the form of spectacular shearing clouds,' said Matt Tiscareno, lead author of the paper and a Cassini participating scientist at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. 'The sunlight shining edge-on to the rings at the Saturnian equinox acted like an anti-cloaking device, so these usually invisible features became plain to see.' Mr Tiscareno and his colleagues now . suspect meteoroids of this size break up on a first encounter with the . rings, creating secondary meteoroids that then enter into orbit around . Saturn. The impact . into the rings of these bits kicks up the clouds. The tiny particles . forming these clouds have a range of orbital speeds around Saturn, and . the clouds they form soon are pulled into bright, extended streaks. 'Saturn's . rings are unusually bright and clean, leading some to suggest that the . rings are actually much younger than Saturn,' said Jeff Cuzzi, a . co-author of the paper and a Cassini interdisciplinary scientist . specializing in planetary rings and dust at NASA's Ames Research Center . in Moffett Field, California. 'To . assess this dramatic claim, we must know more about the rate at which . outside material is bombarding the rings. This latest analysis helps . fill in that story with detection of impactors of a size that we weren't . previously able to detect directly.'

Growing numbers of people go to church at Christmas but for the rest of the year, congregations continue to shrink, figures show. The festive boost for the Church of England follows years of secular attacks on Christmas. These include what the last Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, called ‘weary annual attempts by right-thinking people to ban or discourage nativity plays or public carol-singing’. Bad figures: Attendance figures show a drop in regular services, but an increase around the holidays, such as Christmas . Attendance figures published yesterday show that more than 2.6million people went to Church of England services on Christmas Day in 2011, a 14.5 per cent increase on the previous year. Christmas congregations in 2010 were pushed down by bad weather, but the  numbers were still 8 per cent up on 2009. However, for the rest of 2011, the records show a bleaker picture of continued decline. ‘Average weekly attendance’, first measured a decade ago because people were said to go to church more often on days other than a Sunday, was just over 1million, 0.3 per cent down on 2010 and 3 per cent below the 2009 level. ‘Usual Sunday attendance’, covering just Sunday services, was 807,472, up 0.8 per cent on 2010 but down 2 per cent from 2009. Holiday spirit: Christmas Day service attendance in 2011 increased by 14.5 per cent on the previous year . The number of church baptisms of children was up 4 per cent on the previous year, but funerals fell by 8 per cent over two years and marriages were down 2 per cent. A total of 51,880 couples were married in churches in 2011, just above half the number in 1991. Some dioceses showed big increases in congregations. Average weekly attendance went up by more than 9 per cent in Norwich, which was identified in the 2011 national census as the least religious place in the country, and more than 10 per cent in Southwell and Nottingham. However, it dropped by nearly 10 per cent in Canterbury, more than 8 per cent in Portsmouth and 8 per cent in Durham. But the Bishop of Norwich, the Right Reverend Graham James, put a positive spin on the figures, saying they are ‘heartening, especially the very strong growth in Christmas Day attendance. Also welcome is the stabilising of the numbers of those who attend church services on a weekly basis’. He added that ‘there is a quiet confidence underlying these figures... [reflecting] the wide nature of the ministry offered by the Church – for all of life, from the cradle to the grave’.","Christmas Day service attendance is up, according to the Church of England ."
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 08:23 EST, 3 January 2012 . A 12-year-old boy is fighting for his life after he was hit in the head by celebratory gunfire an hour into the new year. Detectives say Diego Duran and his family were sitting outside their home in Ruskin, Florida watching fireworks, reports ABC Action News. Suddenly at around 1am, the young boy's mother Sandra saw him fall to the ground bleeding from the eyes and the nose. Scroll down for video . Victim: Diego Duran, 12, was shot in the head by a stray bullet during New Year's celebrations. He remains in critical condition at hospital in Ruskin, Florida . Diego's father, also named Diego,told cfnews13.com that his son just dropped. 'All of a sudden, hell breaks loose - blood all over the place.' He was rushed to hospital, where doctors realised that he was suffering from a gun shot wound and the bullet had entered the top of his head and was lodged in his cheek. The boy is in a coma, but did squeeze a nurse's hand and also opened his eyes, his family said. Although his son remains in a critical condition, Mr Duran told cfnews13.com that he was not giving up. Tragic: Diego was watching fireworks outside his home when he fell to the ground . Worry: Diego's father, also named Diego, said his son 'ain't going to give up' He said: 'He’s one of the best men somebody’s ever going to meet when he grows up. 'He’s a man in the making. Somebody just put a stop on him, but he ain’t . going give up. He’s going to grow up and be a better man than what I am.' More people are injured or killed each year by falling bullets than many would believe. From 1985 to 1992, 118 victims of gunshot wounds in the Los Angeles area alone were thought to have been struck by them. These included people hit by bullets while going about their everyday business. The chance of being killed by a falling bullet is much higher than a typical shooting - because those unlucky enough to be hit by falling shells are more likely to be struck on the head. And while bullets are travelling slower after being shot into the sky, they are still capable of smashing skulls. Doctors say a spent bullet falls back to Earth with a speed of between 90 and 180 metres per second. A bullet travelling at less than 60 metres per second can cause a fatal skull injury. Detectives believe the boy was hit by celebratory gunfire falling from the sky after it was fired from a distance that could have been miles away. Sheriff's office spokesman Larry McKinnon said the boy is in a hospital in Tampa in a critical condition with the bullet still lodged. 'It is a crime,' he told 10 News. 'It was an irresponsible act and if we find out who did that the consequences are going to be some very serious charges.' Investigating detectives found that no one nearby had been firing a gun. The incident follows the death in December of a teenage Amish girl who police said died in a 'freak accident' after a hunter fired his gun into the air a mile away. Rachel Yoder, 15, from Ohio, was shot in the head when she was riding her horse and cart back from a Christmas party. At first it was thought she died as a result of falling from her buggy after her brother found her in a pool of blood. But when she got to the hospital they found a bullet lodged in her head. Holmes County Sheriff Timothy Zimmerly told ABC News the man said he was preparing to clean his muzzle-loaded rifle after deer hunting and fired it into the air. Sheriff Zimmerly said the bullet from his rifle 'is consistent with' the one that struck the girl riding in a buggy more than a mile away.

Jodi Arias’ sentencing was postponed Thursday and will continue next week as she is believed to be on suicide watch in the prison psychiatric ward after being found guilty of first degree murder. Court officials did not formally announce that their concerns over her mental state were the reason for the delay, but it was revealed that they felt it was necessary because of her comments in an interview immediately after her guilty verdict was handed down. Speaking to the local Fox affiliate KSAZ, Arias said that she would 'prefer to die sooner than later.' Psych ward: Jodi Arias is reportedly on suicide watch after talking about how she wants to die . ‘Longevity runs in my family, and I don't want to spend the rest of my natural life in one place. I'm pretty healthy, I don't smoke and I'll probably live for a long time so that's not something that I am looking forward to. 'I believe death is the ultimate freedom and I'd rather have my freedom as soon as I can get it.' The jury was originally scheduled to return to the courtroom on Thursday afternoon to decide whether Arias will receive the death penalty or if she will be sentenced to upwards of 25 years behind bars for the murder of her on-again off-again boyfriend Travis Alexander on June 4, 2008. The Maricopa County Sheriff's Office . said it put Arias on suicide watch following her statements to MyFoxPhoenix, which came just minutes after she was found guilty of first-degree murder. Taking precautions: The Maricopa County Sheriff's office are trying to keep the murderer from harming herself as she awaits the next portion of her sentencing process . 'At the conclusion of this interview and . in light of some of her statements during the interview, Arias was . brought to jail and... was placed . on suicide protocol,' a statement from the sheriff's office read. 'Until . she is released from suicide protocol by Sheriff’s officials, no . further media interviews of inmate Arias will be permitted.' Arias’ public decree that she prefers a death sentence will not necessarily influence the final verdict. She can decide whether or not she wants to testify and plead for her life, and from there, they have to also have to consider the severity and aggressive nature of the crime. If the jury finds that it was sufficiently heinous- which in legal terms is called the discovery that aggravation exists- they will move on to the penalty phase and suggest that she either spends life behind bars or death. Speaking out: Jodi Arias gave an interview to a local news station just minutes after the verdict and she said that she hopes she gets the death penalty because she doesn't want to 'spend the rest of my natural life in one place' The jury agreed with prosecutors that . she had plotted to kill Travis Alexander, a Mormon motivational speaker . and salesman, who was found stabbed, shot and nearly decapitated in his . shower in 2008. In the interview, she said that she was shocked by the outcome and hoped to get the death penalty. 'The worst outcome would be natural life because longevity runs in my family,' she said. 'The worst outcome would be natural . life. 'I would much rather die sooner rather than later because longevity . runs in my family, and I don't want to spend the rest of my natural . life in one place. I'm pretty healthy, I don't smoke and I'll probably . live for a long time so that's not something that I am looking forward . to. Guilty! Jody Arias, 32, was found guilty of first-degree murder in the death of her ex, Travis Alexander . Insistence: Arias, 32, had claimed that she killed Alexander in self defense after she attacked him . The interview took place in a holding . room inside the courthouse just 20 minutes after the guilty verdict was . rendered, sparking cheers among the crowd swarming the outside of the . court. Since she admitted that she killed Alexander, there was no chance that she would have been found innocent, but the question of whether or not she planned the murder or whether it was committed as an act of self defense. On Wednesday, five members of the 12-person jury found it was premeditated and the seven others found that it was both premeditated and a felony murder. 'It was unexpected for me yes because . there was no premeditation on my part,' she said. 'The . whole time I was fairly confident that I wouldn't get premeditation . because there was no premeditation.' Killed: Alexander's body was found repeatedly stabbed and shot in his shower in June 2008 . She said that she would have . understood if they simply found her guilty of felony murder 'because of . the way that the law is written' but also attributes some of her own . actions that caused the jury not to believe her. 'I can understand that because of the lies I told in the beginning, to try to cover this and hide that,' Arias said calmly. She took shots at prosecutor Juan Martinez, who she sparred with for weeks during her questioning. 'Prior . to trial, I respected Juan as a capable attorney even though he's done . some very shady things in my case as far as hiding evidence,' she said. 'In the end, what does it matter - it doesn’t help my case.' Spectacle: Court officials told the public that the verdict was going to be read three hours before it actually happened, giving followers time to gather outside of the Maricopa Courthouse . Victory: Crowds cheer when they heard Jodi Arias was convicted of first degree murder Wednesday afternoon . Invested: Three women break down outside the court following the guilty verdict on Wednesday . Arias said that she was 'overwhelmed' and 'went blank' following the verdict, even though she showed little emotion and simply looked back at the spectators. Some of the hundreds of Alexander . supporters who gathered outside of the courtroom awaiting the verdict . held posters praising Martinez, one even suggesting he runs for governor . of Arizona. In the interview, she . did not apologize to the Alexander family, saying only that 'now that a . verdict has been rendered that they can find peace, or some semblance . of peace.' When asked what she would do if she were to go back to the moment when she was standing by her car in the desert with her hands covered in Alexander's blood, she said that she would drive directly to the Mesa, Arizona police department. Blame: Arias accused prosecutor Juan Martinez of lying in the case, while others praised him for his approach . In the courtroom, she repeatedly said that she did not know what she would have done. Though she has been separated from her original pod of cellmates, Arias said that she got a sense of how big the trial was getting when new inmates would enter the prison and seek her out. 'They want to shake my hand, they want to give me a hug. They want my autograph - I'm not going to sign anything,' she said.

Muhammed Saleem, 75, was stabbed three times and stamped on as he made his way back from his local mosque on Monday evening. The father of seven, described as a ‘highly respected’ figure in the community, was found by horrified neighbours in a pool of blood just yards from his front door in Small Heath, Birmingham. He was pronounced dead in hospital later that night. Yesterday the officer leading the investigation into the death of the retired baker admitted racism was a ‘significant line of inquiry’.

Disgraced former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn has a new girlfriend who is two decades younger than him, it emerged today. The 63-year-old, who is still embroiled in a series of sex scandals, has already enjoyed a sun-kissed holiday with Myriam Aouffir, a high-profile press officer for French television. It comes after Mr Strauss-Kahn's wife, Anne Sinclair, confirmed she has split from her scandal hit husband at the end of last month. Ms Sinclair, 64, originally stuck by Mr Strauss-Kahn after he was embroiled in a catalogue of scandals since being charged with trying to rape a New York hotel chambermaid in May last year. The multi-millionaire heiress finally kicked her husband out of their Paris apartment in June, before immersing herself in a new job running an internet site in the French capital. Now Ms Sinclair is faced with photographs of Mr Strauss-Kahn and his new 43-year-old girlfriend which appear in the latest edition of Paris magazine VSD. They show Mr Strauss-Kahn canoodling with the 'bubbly single girl' Ms Aouffir who has a 'senior job in a big television chain'.

He then returned to France last year only to face accusations of sexually abusing a young French writer. French judges agreed there was a case against Strauss-Kahn, but had to drop it because the alleged attack happened more than a decade ago. Strauss-Kahn was then charged with conspiring with pimps in Lille, northern France, to procure girls for sex parties around the world. Strauss-Kahn is currently on bail for 100,000 euros and banned from leaving France while prosecutors decide if he should be brought to trial. In the media frenzy that followed his return to France last year, it emerged he had had up to ten separate affairs during his marriage.

Bowel cancer rates among men have soared by more than a quarter in the last 35 years, new figures have revealed. But the rise among women is far lower, at around six per cent. A report from Cancer Research UK says reasons for the widening gap in disease rates between the sexes remains a mystery, although it is replicated in other countries. Bowel cancer is linked to lifestyle factors such as obesity and diets high in red and processed meat and low in fibre. But some experts believe the link with obesity seems to be stronger in men. Bowel cancer rates among men have soared by more than a quarter in the last 35 years, new figures have revealed . Bowel cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death in the UK after lung cancer. Incidence of the disease has climbed from 45 cases per 100,000 men in 1975-77 to 58 cases in 2008-10, a rise of 29 per cent, said the report. Over the same time period, rates for women have increased only slightly from 35 to 37 per 100,000. The biggest rise was seen among people aged in their 60s and 70s, who now account for 23,000 new cases each year. However, bowel cancer survival is improving, with half of all patients living for at least 10 years after being diagnosed. The figures are released to mark bowel cancer awareness month and the launch of a new campaign by the Bobby Moore Fund. Professor Matthew Seymour, from the University of Leeds, who is director of the National Cancer Research Network, said: ‘We know the risk of bowel cancer increases as we get older and, since we’re all living longer, it’s no surprise to see that the number of people getting the disease is rising. ‘But when we look at these figures and take people’s age into account, we still see that the risk of bowel cancer has gone up in men in the last 35 years. It’s important to find out what’s behind the rise and what we can do about it . ‘The good news is that, thanks to research, we have seen huge improvements in bowel cancer survival over the last 40 years. Smoking, an inactive lifestyle, heavy alcohol intake of more than 4 drinks a day also increase the risk of bowel cancer . ‘It’s this research that’s led to better drugs to treat the disease, improved surgical techniques, the use of more radiotherapy and the introduction of bowel screening to spot the disease earlier, when it is most effectively treated.’ Around 42,000 cases of the disease are diagnosed annually in England, including 18,500 in women and 23,000 in men. Three-quarters of cases are found in people aged 65 and over, and the increasing age of the population is a major reasons for rising rates. Smoking, an inactive lifestyle, heavy alcohol intake of more than 4 drinks a day also increase the risk of bowel cancer. Dr Julie Sharp, senior science . information manager at Cancer Research UK, said: ‘Bowel cancer survival . rates have doubled over the last 40 years and our work is at the heart . of this progress.’ She said the newly introduced NHS . national bowel screening programme had played an important role by . picking up cancers early, when treatment is more likely to succeed. Stephanie Moore founded the Bobby Moore Fund in partnership with Cancer Research UK after her football star husband died of bowel cancer in 1993. To date, the fund has raised around £20 million for research and awareness projects. Mrs Moore said: ‘It’s good to see that despite the rise in incidence, bowel cancer survival is improving. However, it’s vital we continue to fund research to fight this disease as these new statistics show. ‘Bowel cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death in the UK, after lung cancer. 'Finding a way to beat bowel cancer has been my goal for the past two decades and my hope is that by increasing awareness and helping to fund Cancer Research UK’s vital research, many more lives can be saved from this terrible disease in the future.’ The new ‘Make Bobby Proud’ campaign will encourage people to spread the word about the disease and raise funds. It is especially aimed at the football community, as men are more likely to suffer from bowel cancer.","But the rise among women is just 6 per cent, says Cancer Research UK .

Mick Philpott’s ‘shameless’ lifestyle was fuelled by a welfare system which encouraged him to have children for the benefit money they generated, Ann Widdecombe said yesterday. The former Government minister, who spent a week living with the Philpott family for a television documentary, said the father of 17 treated his offspring as ‘meal tickets’. The former Tory Home Office Minister spoke amid a debate over the welfare system’s role in fostering families such as the Philpotts, as sweeping Government reforms aimed at halting a ‘culture of dependency’ come into force this week. Scroll down for video . Meal tickets: The former Government minister spent a week living with the Philpott family for a television documentary . She was backed by councillors in Philpott’s home city of Derby and a local MP, Nigel Mills, in blaming the benefit system for encouraging Philpott’s dysfunctional family set-up. But the Philpotts’ MP, Labour’s Margaret Beckett, said the family were not reflective of benefit claimants in general. Philpott raked in tens of thousands of pounds a year in child benefit, working family tax credits and the wages of his wife and mistress, Lisa Willis, 29, who both worked as cleaners. In the 2007 documentary Ann Widdecombe Versus The Benefit Culture, the then MP found Philpott three jobs but he failed to keep any of them. She said yesterday the ‘prime purpose’ of Philpott’s children was to ‘serve his convenience and provide his benefits’. Conman: Ann Widdecombe said she was appalled by a state system which allowed a man to live in this way . In the 2007 documentary Ann Widdecombe Versus The Benefit Culture, the then MP found Philpott three jobs but he failed to keep any of them . She branded Philpott’s attempts to portray himself as a devoted father and house husband a pathetic con. She said: ‘I’m appalled by what happened to the children and that now wipes out everything else, but before this happened I was appalled by a state system that allowed a man to live in this way so blatantly. 'He tried to portray himself as a house husband, but that was nonsense, he didn’t do anything.’ Conservative councillor Mick Barker, who represents the Oakwood ward at Derby City Council, said: ‘You might think the Philpotts were dysfunctional, but believe me, they were not exceptional and not unique. ‘Everyone in the police knew of Mick and the fact he was using his children to live a life of luxury on welfare, but he was one of dozens of people the authorities dealt with every day who did the same thing.’ Childline founder Esther Rantzen joined neighbours and former friends of the Philpotts in criticising social services for failing to intervene in the family over the decade Philpott lived with his wife, lover and the children. She said Philpott’s history of domestic abuse and the ‘pernicious’ impact violence, fights and arguments would have had on the children should have been enough for them to have stepped in. Derby City Council has refused to comment on the extent of its involvement with the family ahead of a serious case review, but has admitted the children were ‘not subject to child protection plans or legal orders’.

There are now believed to be more than 200,000 cases of basal cell carcinomas, or BCCs, a year, pictured here on the skin . Skin cancer is a far greater threat to the nation’s health than was previously thought, a new study  has revealed. The number of cases of the most common type of skin cancer is approximately double the level shown by Whitehall figures. It is nearly as common as all other cancers put together. There are now believed to be more than 200,000 cases of basal cell carcinomas, or BCCs, a year. Cases of this form of cancer, which is treatable by surgery, have risen by 80 per cent in a decade. The . cost of treating each case is around £1,000 and although the success . rate for surgery is high, the cost to the NHS is likely to be more than . £200million a year. Dr Bav . Shergill, a dermatologist at Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals . NHS Trust, said he was seeing more cases of skin cancer – and the number . of patients are ‘projected to keep on increasing’. He added: ‘It is thought that this is due to a number of factors, . including people living longer, and greater exposure to the sun through . outdoor hobbies, travel and package holidays, and so on.’ The . research was carried out by doctors from Norfolk and Norwich University . Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Eastern Cancer Registration Centre . in Cambridge. Their report said: ‘Our study shows that the number of basal cell carcinomas in the UK is approximately twice that indicated by Government statistics. ‘The effects on population health and on costs to the health services of basal cell skin carcinomas should be recognised. ‘Resources to prevent, diagnose and manage the disease should be prioritised to help control BCC, which now appears to be the commonest malignant disease in the UK.’ Worse than first thought: Image showing how basal cell carcinoma affects the skin surface . Problems with accurately identifying cases and difficulties collecting data mean BCC figures are excluded from official national statistics. ‘Unfortunately, this means that the commonest cancer in the UK is often overlooked by politicians, the public and the media,’ added the report. However, BCC is rarely fatal. Though it accounts for around 75 per cent of all skin cancers, surgery to remove the tumour and surrounding skin is successful in 90 per cent of cases. BCC develops on the outermost layers of the skin and is linked to an overexposure to ultraviolet light. The study showed that BCCs  occur ‘predominantly on sun-exposed areas of elderly people with lighter skin’.","Cases of basal cell carcinomas have risen by 80 per cent in a decade .

"By . David Williams and Tim Shipman . PUBLISHED: . 18:37 EST, 26 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:02 EST, 26 April 2013 . David Cameron yesterday warned that the furore over false intelligence about Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction was stopping Western leaders getting tough with Syria. After accusing Syria’s Bashar al-Assad of war crimes by using the chemical weapon sarin, he admitted the WMD blunders made by Tony Blair’s government offered an excuse for leaders to do nothing. Mr Cameron said: ‘I do worry about that. I think the Iraq lesson must be about how we marshal and use information and intelligence and I think that lesson has been learned. Crisis: As the Syrian civil war rages on, this week the Obama administration announced that as well as conventional weapons, President Assad has used chemical weapons on civilians . Recent interview: President Bashar Assad accused the West on Wednesday of backing al-Qaeda in his country's civil war this week . ‘But I think it is very important for politicians and leaders of this generation to look at what is happening in Syria and ask ourselves what more we can do.’ Earlier Mr Cameron ramped up the rhetoric against Assad over the alleged use of sarin. ‘It is extremely serious, this is a war crime, and we should take it very seriously,’ he said. He echoed Barack Obama by warning ‘this should form for the international community a red line for us to do more’. That is code for military intervention by the West. His statements make British and US air strikes far more likely and officials admit that imposing a ‘no-fly zone’ over Syria is definitely ‘on the table’ for top-level discussion. However, Mr Cameron ruled out sending British troops into Syria saying: ‘Do I think putting troops on the ground in Syria is the right thing to do, as we did in Iraq and Afghanistan? No, I don’t. Should we be working with our allies, the French, Americans, others in the Gulf to support the responsible part of the opposition, do everything we can? To train them, to work with them so they can support their people, to put pressure on the regime? Yes, we should.’ Criticism: David Cameron, right, openly said that the misuse of intelligence under Tony Blair, left, was discouraging leaders from acting over the Syrian civil war . Mr Cameron is expected to lead a National Security Council meeting and talk to Mr Obama next week. National Security Adviser Sir Kim Darroch held video conferences this week with his American opposite number Tom Donilon. Meanwhile, Government scientists at the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down, Wiltshire, have analysed samples smuggled out of Syria and confirmed they are sarin.The samples probably include ones from the Syrian government’s attack on April 13 near the city of Aleppo. MI6 officers are also working with the CIA to gather intelligence on the exact circumstances in which chemical weapons were used. Dilemma: President Barack Obama faces a hard decision over the ongoing situation in Syria as he said that use of chemical weapons by Assad was the 'red line' British diplomats want to present concrete evidence to the UN Security Council that chemical weapons were used. They need to secure support from Russia for international intervention. Moscow has so far blocked UN action. Asked if air strikes and a no-fly zone are under consideration, a senior Government source said: ‘Nothing is off the table. These are issues that we will be exploring with our allies. The priority is to obtain the full facts. 'The Russians have previously taken the same view as us on the use of chemical weapons so there may be an opportunity to get some movement at the UN. But before we make that case we need the full facts.’ It is feared that Syria’s large arsenal of chemical weapons,  approximately 1,000 tons, stored in 50 towns and cities, could fall into the hands of Al Qaeda.

The discovery of a 'quadruple helix' in human cells could be a key to fighting cancer, say the Cambridge researchers who made the findings. They come almost exactly 60 years after James Watson and Francis Crick burst in to the pub next to their Cambridge lab excitedly proclaiming that they had found the secret of life in the double helix structure of DNA. Quadruple helixes intertwine four rather than two strands of DNA, and had been created in the lab by curious researchers, but it was generally thought that they didn't exist in nature. The quadruple helix had only been seen when it was created by researchers in test tubes, but now scientists have identified them in cancer cells . But now these quadruple helixes - or G-quadruplexes - have been found in cancer cells, according to a study published in Nature Chemistry. The quadruple helix might be unique to human cancer cells - and the discovery means that cancer drugs to target these unusual DNA structures could be developed. 'We are seeing links between trapping the quadruplexes with molecules and the ability to stop cells dividing, which is hugely exciting,' said Professor Shankar Balasubramanian from the University of Cambridge’s Department of Chemistry and Cambridge Research Institute. Shankar Balasubramanian stands in front of a painting called 'Living the Code' by artist Annie Newman at his office in Cambridge University's Department of Chemistry . Cambridge scientists Francis Crick and James Watson with a model of the double helix of DNA, which they discovered in 1953 . The research, which has been funded by Cancer Research UK, shows clear links between concentrations of four-stranded quadruplexes and the process of DNA replication, which is pivotal to cell division and production. DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the hereditary material in humans and almost all other organisms. Nearly every cell in a person’s body has the same DNA. DNA was first isolated by the Swiss physician Friedrich Miescher who, in 1869, discovered a microscopic substance in the pus of discarded surgical bandages. As it resided in the nuclei of cells, he called it nuclein. In 1953, Cambridge scientists James Watson and Francis Crick suggested what is now accepted as the first correct double-helix model of DNA structure in the journal Nature. Their double-helix, molecular model of DNA was then based on a single X-ray diffraction image taken by Rosalind Franklin and Raymond Gosling in May 1952 . Cancers are usually driven by genes called oncogenes that have mutated to increase DNA replication - causing cell proliferation to spiral out of control, and leading to tumour growth. The increased DNA replication rate in oncogenes leads to an intensity in the quadruplex structures. This means that potentially damaging cellular activity can be targeted with synthetic molecules or other forms of treatments. 'This research further highlights the potential for exploiting these unusual DNA structures to beat cancer - the next part of this pipeline is to figure out how to target them in tumour cells,' said Dr Julie Sharp, senior science information manager at Cancer Research UK. Balasubramanian told the BBC: 'I'm hoping now that the pharmaceutical companies will bring this on to their radar and we can perhaps take a more serious look at whether quadruplexes are indeed therapeutically viable targets.' He added: 'The quadruple helix DNA structure may well be the key to new ways of selectively inhibiting the proliferation of cancer cells. 'The confirmation of its existence in human cells is a real landmark.'","Structure only seen in test tubes found in human cancer cells .

Amanda, now 26, escaped from the basement of a Cleveland home on Monday night with Gina DeJesus, 23, and Michele Knight, 32, who all disappeared from the same block ten years ago. They were found with a six-year-old girl, who relatives confirmed Amanda gave birth to while held against her will at the home for a decade. Amanda went missing on April 21, 2003 on the day before her 17th birthday - but her mother, Louwana Miller, never gave up hope that she would see her again. Scroll down for videos . Missed: Louwana Miller is pictured with her daughter Amanda Berry before she vanished in 2003, aged 16 . But Miller, who had been hospitalized for months with pancreatitis and other ailments, died in March 2006 aged just 47, without ever learning that her daughter was alive. She had spent the previous three years . looking for Amanda, whose disappearance took a toll as her health . steadily deteriorated, family and friends said. In November 2004, she even turned to a psychic, Sylvia Browne, on Montel Williams' television show. 'She's not alive, honey,' Browne told her. 'Your daughter's not the kind who wouldn't call.' But Councilwoman Dona Brady said she had spent many hours with Miller, who never gave up hope that her daughter was alive. Before the kidnapping: Amanda Berry, pictured . before her disappearance, was last seen leaving her job at Burger King a day before her 17th birthday and told her sister that she was getting a ride home . Broken hearted: Louwana Miller passed away in 2006 after three years of searching for her daughter . 'She literally died of a broken heart,' Brady said.

Monday night, Amanda had a smile on her face as she hugged her weeping . sister Beth as the pair were reunited for the first time in a decade . following her decade in captivity. The kidnapping victim also introduced her sister to her daughter, who was born during the 10-year ordeal. When . she fled the house where she was a prisoner and ran across the street . to call police, she was holding the hand of a young girl, who she gave . birth to while being held by her captor.

Desperate to know what had happened to her daughter, Amanda Berry's mother Louwana Miller turned to a psychic on Montel Williams' television show in 2004. 'She's not alive, honey,' the psychic, Sylvia Browne, told her. 'Your daughter's not the kind who wouldn't call.' Browne said she could see Amanda's jacket in a dumpster with 'DNA on it'. Miller told The Plain Dealer that the blunt words forced her to consider her daughter might never return. She took down her pictures and gave away some of her belongings. She said she '98 per cent' believed the psychic and that she returned from their meeting extremely distressed. 'I still don’t want to believe it. I want to have hope but, after a year and a half, what else is there?' Miller said. 'It seems like the God-honest truth. My daughter would always call home.' Amanda . is flanked by her older sister Beth Serrano, who has maintained the . search for her sister since their mother died in 2006. Berry . was held in captivity at a house owned by Ariel Castro, who has now . been arrested along with his brothers on suspicion of kidnapping. Neighbors . reported hearing the sound of multiple children playing inside the . house, but the identity of the other children and their relation to each . other are not clear. Gina . DeJesus and Michelle Knight, both apparently abducted from the same . block as Berry, were also held hostage in the same house as her. Beth's husband Ted Serrano told WOIO that his wife was overjoyed about her sister's return. 'She said [Amanda]'s okay, she's got a daughter. She said she's okay, she looks good,' Mr Serrano told the station. Amanda's sister has continued to keep the case in the public eye since their mother died. Relatives were emotional throughout the night on Monday, with some unable to speak through their tears. 'I'm . going to hold her, and I'm going to squeeze her and I probably won't . let her go,' Amanda's cousin Tesheena Mitchell told The Cleveland Plain . Dealer. Emotional: Tasheena Mitchell, Amanda's cousin, said that she can't wait to hug her 'and never let her go' 'She's doing okay': Ted Serrano, Amanda's brother-in-law said that he spoke to his wife who was at the hospital with Amanda and she told him that Amanda had a daughter that she gave birth to during her abduction . Beth Serrano has worked closely with the DeJesus family, whose daughter Gina was found in the same home as Amanda. Last year, DeJesus' mother Nancy Ruiz suggested that her daughter might have been the victim of human trafficking. On Monday night, . Gina's cousin confirmed to CNN that Ms Ruiz had spoken with her . daughter at the hospital and confirmed to relatives that she is alright. Gina's aunt, Sandra Ruiz, said that Gina told them that she knew her family had never given up the search for her, even saying that she had posters they had made in the bedroom where she was staying during her capture. '[Gina] knew who we were, and she knew we were looking for her all this time,' Sandra Ruiz told WOIO. 'She had posters we had posted.' Other case: Gina DeJesus went missing in 2004 on . her way home from school and was held captive with Berry . The . Cleveland Police Department released a brief statement confirming that . the three young women were all safe and 'seem to be in good health.' 'Currently . they're safe, we're in the process of evaluating their medical ends. They appear to be in fair condition at the moment,' Cleveland . MetroHealth Emergency doctor Gerald Maloney told reporters at a press . conference Monday night. 'This is really good because this isn't the ending we usually hear to these stories so we're really happy for them,' he said. The dramatic rescue came when a neighbor heard Berry calling for help, kicked the door of the house in and gave her a telephone to call 911.

A Lithuanian who was allowed to come to Britain despite being convicted of rape in his home country attacked another woman within a month of arriving. Gintas Burinskas, 36, walked into Britain unchecked just three months after he was released from a ten-year jail term. Weeks later, he travelled to Northampton where he dragged a woman off the street and violently assaulted her. A court heard Burinskas throttled the 31-year-old so hard she passed out before dragging her to a wooded area nearby where he raped her. Charities and politicians reacted with outrage after it emerged he could be freed on parole in a little over three years. And they demanded to know why Burinskas was admitted into the country in the first place. Northampton North MP Michael Ellis urged Attorney General Dominic Grieve to review the length of Burinskas’s sentence. He said: ‘I’m not sure how the sentence length of this evil man’s second identical crime can be shorter than his first. He is obviously pathologically dangerous.’ Dawn Thomas, who runs the Northampton branch of charity Rape Crisis, said: ‘The fact a man who was convicted of rape in his own country was allowed to come over to ours so easily and commit the very same crime is something which is of grave concern to us.’ The court heard Burinskas was drinking cider in Northampton town centre when he spotted the woman walking nearby. James House, prosecuting, said the woman avoided eye contact with him and tried to walk away, but he approached her from behind, grabbed her around the throat and began to squeeze. Mr House said: ‘The woman tried to get away, but he was too strong. She shouted for help but her  calls went unheeded.’ Burinskas then pressed harder on the woman’s windpipe until she lost consciousness and dragged her to bushes nearby. When she woke up, Burinskas smashed her in the face – breaking her jaw – and tried to suffocate her again while pouring cider over her face. She was then raped. Following the incident, Burinskas fled and the woman, by now covered in blood, staggered to a nearby hotel to raise the alarm. Officers began a search of the area and arrested Burinskas a short time later. Anger: After his trial at Northampton Crown Court, pictured, campaigners spoke out against Burinskas . The court heard how the attack had left the victim suffering depression and requiring counselling. Burinskas, who has a string of . previous convictions in Lithuania, including rape, burglary and drugs, . pleaded guilty to rape and grievous bodily harm last month. But at Northampton Crown Court on . Thursday Judge Rupert Mayo sentenced him to just seven years in jail – . after giving him a five-year discount for his early guilty plea. He will . be eligible to apply for parole at the half way point, and, if turned . down, will automatically be released two-thirds of the way through that . term. As Burinskas has already served four months on remand, it means he . could be paroled just over three years into his sentence. He was also handed a four-year jail term for grievous bodily harm, to be served concurrently. Sentencing, Judge Rupert Mayo said Burinskas posed a ‘significant risk’ to other women. Any foreign national sentenced to more than 12 months in custody is automatically recommended for deportation. It is believed Burinskas came to . Northampton in November 2012 to visit a family member. He has previously . served a total of 19 years behind bars in Lithuania. In most instances, EU rules mean . Britain must open its doors to citizens of a fellow EU country, even if . they have a criminal record. But offenders who pose a ‘serious risk’ – . such as a rapist – can be turned away by border officials. Lithuania, like other EU member . states, has given an undertaking to warn if a dangerous individual may . be travelling to the UK. Last night it remained unclear if the . Lithuanians had complied with that undertaking or not. In January last year, Lithuanian . builder Rimvydas Liorancas battered a Birmingham couple to death at . their home after slipping in to the country unnoticed despite . convictions for armed robbery and other offences in his homeland.","Gintas Burinskas, 36, spent 10 years in prison in Lithuania for rape .

Police have released a CCTV image of the woman dressed as the comic character, famous for violent outbursts after uttering the phrase 'you wouldn't like me when I'm angry'. The images show the woman dressed in a torn white shirt with dyed red hair, and covered in green body paint. Have you seen this woman? Detectives in York are appealing for witnesses to come forward following an assault in the city . The attack happened outside a branch of McDonald's in York, which has recently lost its 24-hour licence after a series of violent incidents. Police said a 17-year-old girl was attacked at 3am on Friday, 26 April, outside the burger restaurant when the woman dressed as the Incredible Hulk left the restaurant with a group of people. As a result of the assault the victim was left with bruising to her face and a black eye. At the time of the incident the woman suspected of the assault was covered in green body paint with dyed red hair. However police said she is believed to be a white woman, in her late teens or early 20s and around 5ft 8in with a medium build. Detective Constable Cheryl Hunter, of York CID, said: 'This appears to have been a wholly unprovoked assault. Thankfully the injuries were not too severe. However, the outcome could have been far more serious. CCTV footage issued by North Yorkshire Police shows the a woman officers are hunting . The classic TV series The Incredible Hulk starring Lou Ferrigno first appeared on screens in 1977 . 'If you witnessed the assault or can identify the woman I need to speak to about this incident, I ask that you contact the police or Crimestoppers straight away.'

"By . David Williams . UPDATED: . 09:52 EST, 24 June 2011 . Osama bin Laden wanted to give Al Qaeda a new name with more of a religious element . Osama Bin Laden was missing his old friends and believed that Al Qaeda had an image problem which could mean it would have to change its name, an extraordinary letter written by the terror mastermind reveals. In a fascinating and unprecedented insight into the thinking of the 54-year-old Al Qaeda chief in the months before his death, he laments that the organisation was suffering from a marketing problem and that his group had killed too many Muslims – this was bad for business, Bin Laden confesses. The undated letter was discovered among the 'treasure trove' of documents and data found in his hideaway in the Pakistan garrison city of Abbottabad when U.S. Navy Seals raided the fortress-like compound, killing him and two Al Qaeda couriers. Details emerged in Washington as U.S. investigators completed the initial review of documents seized from the compound although intelligence analysis will continue for months. Its contents were described by senior Obama administration and national security officials on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the material. The image it portrays of Bin Laden is one that his supporters and many in the Islamic world are likely to question – a terrorist chief struggling to sell the holy war for an organisation in crisis. The letter suggests Bin Laden believed the West was winning the public relations fight and remarkably needed a fresh beginning under a new name. The documents portray Bin Laden, pictured in a room in his hideout in Abbottabad, as a terrorist chief executive, struggling to sell holy war for a company in crisis . Navy SEALs stormed Bin Laden's Abbottabad compound and killed him before any name change could be made . The problem with the name Al Qaeda, Bin Laden wrote was that it lacked a religious element, something to convince Muslims worldwide that they are in a holy war with America. As Bin Laden saw it, the problem was that the group's full name, Al Qaeda al-Jihad, for The Base of Holy War, had become short-handed as simply Al Qaeda. Cutting out the word 'jihad,' he wrote, allowed the West to 'claim deceptively that they are not at war with Islam.' Maybe it was time for Al Qaeda to bring back its original name, he mused. Perhaps something like Taifat al-Tawhed Wal-Jihad, meaning Monotheism and Jihad Group, would do the trick, he wrote. Or Jama'at I'Adat al-Khilafat al-Rashida, meaning Restoration of the Caliphate Group. Bin Laden wrote his thoughts about renaming Al Qaeda as a letter but, as with many of his writings, the recipient was not identified. U.S. intelligence officials say with the need for absolute secrecy, Bin Laden only communicated with his most senior commanders, including his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri, and his No. 3, Mustafa Abu al-Yazid. Because of the courier system Bin Laden used, it's unclear to U.S. intelligence whether the letter ever was sent. His two most trusted couriers – the men who are unwittingly said to have led the CIA to Bin Laden’s hideout where he lived with his wives and children - were shot dead by the US Abbottabad raiding party. One of Bin Laden’s sons also died. Al-Yazid was killed in a U.S. airstrike last year but Egyptian-born Zawahri has replaced Bin Laden as head of Al Qaeda and is believed to be planning a spectacular revenge attack at a time when the uprisings across the Arab world have helped to undermine the terror network. The recipient of the letter was not identified but U.S. intelligence officials have determined that Bin Laden only communicated with his most senior commanders, including his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri (pictured) In one letter sent to Zawahri within the past year or so, Bin Laden said Al Qaeda’s image was suffering because of attacks that have killed Muslims, particularly in Iraq, officials said. In other journal entries and letters, officials said, Bin Laden wrote that he was frustrated that many of his trusted longtime friends and comrades, who he'd fought alongside in Afghanistan, had now been killed or captured. Using his courier system, Bin Laden could still exercise some operational control over Al-Qaida, the letter shows, but increasingly the men he was directing were younger and inexperienced. Frequently, the generals who had vouched for and directed these young fighters were dead or in prison. Unable to leave his walled compound some 30 miles from the Pakistan capital Islamabad, Bin Laden was annoyed that he did not know so many people in his own organisation. At the White House, the documents were taken as positive reinforcement for President Barack Obama's effort to eliminate religiously charged words from the government's language of terrorism. Words like 'jihad,' which also has a peaceful religious meaning, are out. 'Islamic radical' has been replaced by descriptions such as 'terrorist' and 'mass murderer.' Although former members of President George W. Bush's administration have backed that effort, it also has drawn ridicule from critics who said the president was being too politically correct. 'The information that we recovered from Bin Laden's compound shows Al Qaeda under enormous strain,' Obama said on Wednesday in his speech to the nation on withdrawing troops from Afghanistan. 'Bin Laden expressed concern that Al Qaeda had been unable to effectively replace senior terrorists that had been killed and that Al Qaeda has failed in its effort to portray America as a nation at war with Islam, thereby draining more widespread support.' A mobile phone also recovered from the raid contained numbers of militant group tied with Pakistan's intelligence agency. The discovery indicates that Bin Laden used the group, Harakat-ul-Mujahedeen, as part of his support network within the country. U.S. officials say it also raises questions over whether the Al Qaeda chief was being sheltered by elements within the spy agency. Analysts tracing calls made on the phone have found that Harakat commanders called Pakistani intelligence officials and that the agency had mentored the group and allowed it to operate within the country for 20 years. It is not known if the calls were to discuss Bin Laden and there is no proof that Pakistan's intelligence agency protected the terror chief.","Mobile phone recovered from raid contained numbers of militant group tied with Pakistan's intelligence agency .

Back to basics: Jeremy Hunt will today announce that trainee nurses will have to work as a healthcare assistant or support worker first . Student nurses are to be forced to work for a year as healthcare assistants to improve compassion in the NHS. The back-to-basics approach comes amid claims that many trainee nurses, educated to degree-level, consider themselves ‘too posh to wash’. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt will today announce that trainee nurses who want NHS funding will have to work as a healthcare assistant or support worker first. He will insist ‘hands-on caring experience’ is just as important as academic training. Other measures in response to the needless deaths of up to 1,200 patients at Stafford Hospital will include: . A new chief inspector of hospitals to oversee an inspection system modelled on schools watchdog Ofsted . A statutory ‘duty of candour’ on hospitals and GP surgeries to stop them concealing mistake . A ban on gagging clauses preventing NHS whistleblowers from speaking out . An ‘elderly care tsar’ to protect the interests of older people in care homes . A new criminal offence to prevent managers fiddling figures such as waiting times and death rates . Last year the Care Quality Commission delivered a damning verdict on the state of the NHS. It found 15 per cent of hospitals failed to meet national standards on ensuring patients had enough food and drink and 10 per cent did not treat people with dignity and respect. Inspectors found examples of nurses treating patients as ‘objects’, failing to close curtains when they were carrying out personal tasks, talking over patients and speaking to them in a ‘condescending or dismissive way’. Many hospitals had out-of-reach call bells or staff who failed to answer them in a reasonable time. The Daily Mail has highlighted the failure of some nurses to care for patients as part of our Dignity for the Elderly campaign. Prime Minister David Cameron (left) insisted yesterday that the NHS went back to basics in the wake of the Mid Staffordshire scandal. Jeremy Hunt (right) says 'hands-on' care is just as important as academic training . In a Commons statement today, Mr Hunt will call for a fundamental change in the culture of the NHS. Students seeking NHS funding for nursing degrees will be required to work for up to a year as a healthcare assistant or support worker. The scheme could be extended beyond nursing in the future, meaning doctors would have to spend time learning hands-on care. Ministers will also publish a code of conduct for healthcare support workers, with clear requirements on behaviour and attitude. Mr Hunt said: ‘Frontline, hands-on caring experience and values need to be equal with academic training. ‘These measures are about recruiting all staff with the right values and giving them the training they need to do their job properly, so that patients are treated with compassion.’ A series of measures will be enforced in response to the needless deaths of up to 1,200 patients at Stafford Hospital . Insiders say the new chief inspector of hospitals, who will become the most powerful figure in the NHS, is expected to rate hospitals and GP practices as outstanding, good, needing improvement or poor. One third of the entire score will be based on patient experience – the extent to which patients would recommend a service to friends and family. Ministers will also create an ‘elderly care tsar’ to protect the interests of older people in care homes and challenge institutions which  perform badly in the new Ofsted-style ratings. Ministers are also expected to announce that hospitals and GP surgeries which hide mistakes that lead to patients being harmed will be punished. All healthcare providers in the NHS will be subject to a new ‘duty of candour’. The Francis Report into the Stafford Hospital scandal called for it to apply to both institutions and individuals such as doctors, nurses and managers. But it is understood that the Health Secretary has rejected the call for the duty to apply to individuals.Instead, only NHS trusts and GP surgeries as a whole will be held responsible and could perhaps face fines. David Cameron insisted yesterday the NHS had to go ‘back to basics’ in the wake of Mid Staffs. ‘In the end it’s all about making sure we get back to basic thoughts in the NHS – about standards of care, about care attention for patients and making sure we do right by them. That is the key,’ he said. Roger Goss, of the pressure group Patient Concern, said: ‘Nurses at present are being told by their Royal College that theirs is now a degree profession on a par with doctors, so they think: “Why should I wipe someone’s bottom? Why should I make sure they have a shower? I’m far too posh to wash – or to care”. ‘It was a bad day for patients when someone decided nursing was a degree profession. It’s not, it’s a vocation.’","Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt will insist 'hands-on caring' is just as important as academic training .

Christmas can be a very stressful time for people with dementia (posed by models) •    Memory loss. We all forget where we have put our keys or to pass on a message from time to time. But when memory problems start to interfere with day to day life, or if early memories become easier to remember than more recent ones, this could be an early sign of dementia. •    Problems thinking or reasoning, or finding it hard to follow conversations or TV programmes•    Feeling anxious, depressed or angry about memory loss, or feeling confused, even when in a familiar environmentWhat should someone do if they are worried about a loved one’s memory . If you are worried that someone may have dementia, try and encourage them to visit their GP to get a proper diagnosis. Alzheimer's Society provides tips on how to raise the topic of dementia with a loved one. These include: . •    Be positive - a diagnosis can give people access to the help and support they need, or the GP can help you rule out dementia and treat other symptoms. •    Make notes of situations that have got you worried. Giving examples will help you to express yourself in a clear and real way.•    Make sure it's an open conversation and be a good listener. Allow the person to discuss their feelings and thoughts . People with dementia at Christmas . Christmas can be a very stressful time for people with dementia - from the confusion of battling with panic-stricken shoppers for presents to the disorientation of spending the day in a packed and potentially unfamiliar house.  Alzheimer’s Society has compiled some top tips for having a guest with dementia this Christmas: . •    Plan ahead: If the house is unfamiliar to your guest, putting labels on doors could help – for example, the bathroom, the kitchen. •    Think about safety: make sure you leave lights on and doors opens so the person with dementia is less likely to get confused if they’re up at night. •    Don’t overload your guest’s plate at dinner time. Although many people eat a lot at Christmas, a full plate can be quite daunting for someone who has difficulties eating. •    Think of some activities the person may enjoy doing in quieter moments. Try to involve people in your own activities, such as walking or cooking.•    If the house becomes very busy, designate a 'quiet room'  and agree not to watch television or listen to music in there. •    It might be enjoyable for the person to sing carols – it’s good to do something jointly with other people but singing also stimulates both mind and body.
