"By . Ruth Styles . With her love of horses and appreciation for tradition, the Queen is an unlikely fan of contemporary dance. But that didn't stop her from making a visit to the Rambert Contemporary Dance Company's new South Bank home, although she did seem a little bemused during one of the performances. Accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, the Queen was wreathed in smiles as she made her way into the state-of-the-art premises ahead of the performance and given a tour of the new building by excited staff. What's going on? The Queen is stony-faced as she watches one of the contemporary dancers perform . Nonplussed: The Queen looks less than impressed with the contemporary dance performance . Resplendent in a bright pink coat which she teamed with a matching dress and hat, the monarch appeared to be on good form as she greeted onlookers. Despite recent bouts of ill-health, the Duke of Edinburgh looked in fine fettle and was dapper in a navy suit that complemented the Queen's cheerful ensemble. Once inside, the couple were treated to a performance from some of the dancers currently on the Rambert's books, although not everything appeared to be to the Queen's liking. But all that changed when she was introduced to some of the talent at the company, beaming and clearly enjoying the conversation as she greeted dancers who had waited in line to meet her. One of the UK's oldest dance outfits, The Rambert Contemporary Dance Company was founded in 1926 by Polish émigré Marie Rambert who hoped to pioneer contemporary choreography and support aspiring dancers.

Conversation: The Queen seemed to be enjoying her chat with this pair of beaming contemporary dancers . Inspection: The Queen was given a tour of the Rambert's state-of-the-art new HQ on London's South Bank . Offering a combination of classic and modern routines, it is the only British dance company to tour with an orchestra and is famous for its daring routines set to live music. The Queen's visit to the contemporary dance company is her second musical engagement this week, with the other being the presentation of the Queen's Medal for Music during a ceremony at Buckingham Palace. This year's winner of the prestigious award was opera star, Sir Thomas Allen, who enjoyed a lengthy career as a baritone, beginning with a 1971 performance at the Royal Opera House, before a more recent stint as a director. Sir Thomas, who is thought to have inspired the musical Billy Elliot, is the ninth winner of the award, which in previous years, has recognised such luminaries as Welsh singer Bryn Terfel and soprano Dame Emma Kirkby.

"By . Emma Innes . All expectant parents hope their unborn baby will grow up to become a happy and healthy person. So, if they are suddenly told their child will have a disability, they often experience a huge amount of worry and fear. In a bid to offer reassurance and comfort to parents-to-be who find themselves in this position, a heart-warming video featuring people with Down’s syndrome has been released. Scroll down for video . For World Down Syndrome Day a video featuring 15 young people with Down's syndrome has been launched. It shows the actors (including Sarah Gordy, pictured, who recently appeared in Call The Midwife) giving a reassuring message of hope to a mother-to-be who is expecting a baby with Down's syndrome . The video, which was launched on YouTube for World Down Syndrome Day, which is on Friday, has been viewed more than a million times in less than a week. The film was created by Saatchi & Saatchi for CoorDown - the Italian Coordinator of the National Association of People with Down Syndrome. It features a group of 15 young adults and children from across Europe all of whom have Down’s syndrome. The actors involved in the film include Sarah Gordy who has Down's syndrome and who appeared in BBC1's Call The Midwife on February 16. They each share a tear-jerking message which is aimed at a mother-to-be who has just learned her baby has the genetic condition. The video, which has currently been viewed almost 1.2 million times, opens with this statement: ‘On the 9th of February, we received this email from a future mom. The video has been viewed nearly 1.2 million times on YouTube since it was released less than a week ago . The film was created by Saatchi & Saatchi for CoorDown - the Italian Coordinator of the National Association of People with Down Syndrome . The actors each tell the expectant mother some of the things her child will be able to do. These include, learning to write, to speak and going to school . '""I'm expecting a baby. I've discovered he has Down syndrome. I'm scared: what kind of life will my child have?""' The message goes on to say: 'Today we reply to her like this.' The film then shows a group of young people with Down's syndrome, all of whom address the mother to explain what her child will be able to do. They say: 'Dear future mom, don't be afraid, your child will be able to do many things. 'He'll be able to hug you. He'll be able to run towards you. He'll be able to speak and tell you he loves you.' The participants, who speak in a range of European languages, go on: 'He'll be able to go to school, like everybody. He'll be able to learn to write. And he'll be able to write to you.' The participants, who speak in a range of European languages, say: 'He'll be able to go to school, like everybody. He'll be able to learn to write. And he'll be able to write to you' The actors also explain that the child will be able to work, travel and live independently . The film also acknowledges that bringing up a child with a disability can be difficult but points out that bring up any child comes with many challenges . They conclude: 'Sometimes it will be difficult. Very difficult. Almost impossible. But isn't it like that for all mothers? 'Dear future mom, your child can be happy. Just like I am. And you'll be happy too.' Down's syndrome is a genetic condition that causes some level of learning disability and a characteristic range of physical features. Most babies with Down's syndrome are diagnosed shortly after birth and are likely to have reduced muscle tone, eyes that slant upwards, a low birth weight, a small nose and mouth and short fingers. They also have some degree of learning disability, but this varies widely between children. The film ends with a message of hope for the expectant mother as the actors explain that her child can be happy, and that she will also be happy . The actors say: 'Dear future mom, your child can be happy. Just like I am. And you'll be happy too' The film is extremely heart-warming and has prompted an outpouring of positive feeling on YouTube . Some children with Down's syndrome also have associated health problems such as heart disorders, digestive problems, hearing and visual impairments, thyroid dysfunction and blood disorders. It is one of the most common genetic causes of learning disability and around 750 babies are born with the condition each year in the UK. It is caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21 in the baby's cells. Currently, no one knows what causes the presence of the extra chromosome but Down's syndrome is more common in children born to older mothers. For example, if a woman has a baby when she is 25 there is a one in 1,250 chance of her baby having Down's syndrome, but if a 45-year-old woman has a baby, there is a one in 30 chance of the baby having Down's syndrome. The film ends with all of the actors giving their mothers a hug .","The video has been launched for World Down Syndrome Day, on Friday .

"By . Dominic King . Click here to read Sportsmail's Exclusive Interview with Daniel Sturridge: 'I'm not arrogant... I'm just a happy guy' There will come a point today, as  Liverpool’s team bus snakes through the streets of Cardiff, when Daniel Sturridge will zone out from those around him. All conversation will stop, his phone will come out and Sturridge will devote all concentration to the small screen in front of him. If your instinct is to say this is a lack of manners, think again. It’s  actually the start of an intricate pre-match routine, designed to bring him to fever pitch. For on Sturridge’s phone is a compilation of the 28 goals he has scored in his 15 months as a  Liverpool player. He analyses them relentlessly, imagining how the next header, volley or tap-in will look. Clearly the studying is  paying off. Sturr it up! Daniel Sturridge is the league's leading English goalscorer with 18 goals so far this season . Inspiration: Sturridge watches a compilation of his goals ahead of games to get him in the scoring mood . Can they do it? liverpool travel to Cardiff on Saturday still in the race for the Premier League title . ‘I watch the goals to get me in the mood and to give myself a vision of how I want the game to go,’ Sturridge explains, as he holds court in the media room at Liverpool’s Melwood training base. ‘I have got more clips as the season has gone on, but that’s good. ‘I will do the same routine against Cardiff. The clips now last around 15-20 minutes which is normally what the coach ride to a stadium takes, so it is perfect. I still get the same feeling every time I watch the video back. ‘After that in the changing room, I will be dancing and joking. A lot of players are straight-faced and serious, some are the opposite. It’s like that until about 10 minutes before kick-off and I am in the zone. Then there is no more joking about.’ This is a candid insight into the workings of a young man for whom the next few months will be momentous. As England’s main striker, expectation will grow the closer the World Cup comes into view but, before that, he could help his club achieve something remarkable. Main man: Sturridge looks set to lead England's attack at the World Cup in Brazil, despite his dodgy celebrations . Dynamic duo: Sturridge has formed the Premier League's most potent partnership with Luis Suarez (L) old enemy: United players are furious after Sturridge wins a penalty in Liverpool's 4-1 victory at Old Trafford . Apps  Goals Assists Yellow Cards . Sturridge    19 (2)   18        7              3 . Liverpool might be outsiders but there is no disputing they are in the thick of a pulsating title race and Sturridge has done as much as anyone to get them there. His fortunes have mirrored that of his team, on a constant upward spiral since the turn of last year. If it was initially doubted whether Sturridge, who had been saddled with a reputation for being  difficult, would be a good fit at  Liverpool, it is now impossible  to imagine Brendan Rodgers’s side operating without the 24-year-old. Anfield’s stage suits him. Before he headed north, he spoke with a striker who knew what relentless goalscoring in a red shirt could do.  Fernando Torres’s love affair with the Kop ended the day he joined Chelsea in 2011 for £50million but that did not stop him giving  Sturridge some significant advice. Raw talent: Sturridge began his professional career at Manchester City . Blues brother: Sturridge moved to Chelsea but became frustrated with his lack of playing time . Red leader: Sturridge has found the perfect place to develop his game at Anfield . ‘He always spoke very highly about Liverpool,’ says Sturridge. ‘When we were at Chelsea together he would say, “Liverpool are  amazing”, and it wasn’t just him — it was Yossi Benayoun as well. They both said, “That club is the best I have played for”. ‘They said the fans will make you feel amazing and, at the time, I thought I need a bit of that in my life because I was low right then. ‘I need to feel good about myself, so it was an easy decision to come here. My dad (Michael), my uncle (Dean, the former Derby striker) and I all shared the same opinion: this was the best place to go. When Liverpool came in, it was one of those situations that I just wanted to get up the M6 as quick as possible, sign on the dotted line and get to work. Training day: Fernando Torres (C) told Sturridge that Liverpool were the best club he ever played for . Reversal of fortune: Torres was not the same player after leaving Liverpool for Chelsea for £50m in 2011 . Take a bow: Sturridge moved in the opposite direction and scored on his debut against Mansfield Town . ‘I was desperate to get here and show what I could do. I was  hungry and I am still hungry. There is so much for us to achieve.’ What they might achieve in the next nine games, starting against Cardiff, has supporters daring to dream. Sturridge was only eight months old when Liverpool last ruled the land but this, perhaps, is their best chance since 1990 and if he and Luis Suarez keep scoring, anything is possible. Between them they have  plundered 43 goals in the Barclays Premier League but that has not stopped the perception that there is some friction between the pair, not least when Suarez has been caught on camera berating his partner for not passing. Friend or foe? There have been question marks over the relationship between Sturridge and Suarez . License to thrill: Sturridge has nicknamed Steven Gerrard 'James Bond', because he can do everything . Do you wanna see a trick? Meanwhile, Sturridge as labelled Philippe Coutinho 'David Blaine' for his magical passes . ‘Yeah well, I do the same to him!’ Sturridge responds. ‘Luis does have a go at players but that’s because he wants the best. I want the best, too, the same as Stevie (Gerrard). We all do. We are at a stage now where we have to push everyone to their maximum. ‘Some players respond to shouting, some don’t. Everyone is different and that is one of a  manager’s strengths to understand that some don’t respond to that. ‘But I feel that as a team, if we push each other to our limits, we can achieve something.’ Having dubbed Gerrard ‘James Bond’ — Sturridge feels there is nothing Liverpool’s captain can’t do — and Philippe Coutinho ‘David Blaine’ as he is ‘a magician’, Sturridge is working on a nickname for Suarez but only once they have taken care of the serious business. Confident: Despite manager Brendan Rodgers playing down title talk, Sturridge insists Liverpool are in the mix . Favourite: Sturridge rates his glancing header in the 3-3 derby against Everton as his best goal this season . Reach for the sky: Sturidge's goals could still help fire Liverpool to his dream of winning the Premier League . There are more goals to be scored and while Sturridge regards the glancing header that salvaged a  3-3 draw against Everton in November as his favourite so far, the best — and most important —may be yet to come. ‘At the beginning of the season the aim for everyone was to get into the Champions League,’ says Sturridge, who already has a title medal from his spell with Chelsea. ‘But as time has gone on and we have done well, now we’re getting towards the business end and we’re up there. ‘A lot of people’s perception is that maybe we can win the league. There are others in a better  position so we just have to take each one as it comes and see where we end up. When I came here it was a dream, of course, to be involved in winning titles.’","Sturridge is the Premier League's leading English scorer with 18 goals .

"By . Jaymi Mccann . Wellwishers cheering the Queen were startled when a soldier she’d just spoken to suddenly sat down in the road. Many thought he’d collapsed with heat exhaustion during the royal tour of Kendal, Cumbria. But Her Majesty knew exactly what was going on and didn’t bat an eyelid. Scroll down for video . Sitting: Sgt Rusiate Bolavucu sat on the ground as a mark of respect for the Queen as she visited Kendal, Cumbria . The monarch understood what the crowds didn’t - that it was Fijian mark of respect for royalty. Sgt Rusiate Bolavucu, 32, representing the Burma Company, part of the 1st Battalion Duke of Lancaster Regiment, was following an ancient tradition from his South Pacific homeland. He said: 'It is a traditional and cultural thing for people from Fiji to do when they meet a head of state. It is a way of showing respect. 'The Queen has been to Fiji so she knows about it, and she had asked me where I was from, so she smiled when she saw what I was doing.' It is very important to show respect to one’s elders or to those in authority in Fijian culture. This is done through a variety of actions taking into account body posture and position, clothing and gestures. In Fijian culture it is thought that good things come through the head and are passed down to the feet. It is important to make sure that one’s head is not above others in the room. Respect: The soldier raised his cap as the monarch passed him, a tradition common in Fiji . Men sit cross legged as it is rude to draw one’s knees up to the chest. He was among other solders from the . 1st Battalion, who had just returned from Afghanistan, and those from . 4th Battalion the Duke of Lancaster Regiment, who all managed to say a . few words to the Queen. Thousands . came out in the sunshine to catch a glimpse of Her Majesty and Princess Anne, as they stopped at Kendal, Burneside, Bowness and . Windermere. Oxenholme station was packed with well wishers as the duo pulled up in the Diamond Jubilee Royal train, before heading to Kendal town centre where ten-deep crowds waited in anticipation. The atmosphere buzzed with remarks of admiration as the pair chatted to dignitaries, cadets, members of the Royal British Legion and soldiers. Councillor for Kendal Parks, Phillip Walker, also got to talk to Her Majesty, and he made sure she did not leave without a bar of the famous Mint Cake. Mr Walker, who had been in the town centre at 8am to make sure he got a glance of the Royals, said: 'I gave the Queen some of Romney’s chocolate covered mint cake. Unusual: He stands after the Queen passes him. The monarch was not fazed as she knew that it was an act of respect . 'She thanked me for it and I said . thank you for visiting Kendal. She seemed really friendly and smiley and . it was so exciting to see her, and the Princess Royal, in my home . town.' Mint Cake was not the only foodie treat that the visitors left with, as both were given a hamper of goods from Made in Cumbria. And the Queen seemed pleased to receive one product in particular. Retail manager Tracey Graham, who presented the hampers, said: 'She said that she was definitely going to keep the damson gin for herself! 'Princess Anne was also thrilled with the gift and said that she hoped the Mint Cake we included would see her through the day.' After receiving posies from Kendal school pupils, Amelia Nicholl and Harry Coward, the Queen, who was wearing a green and blue floral dress with a plain green coat, and her only daughter headed to Burneside. There they gave the Royal seal of approval to a new multi-million pound plant at specialist paper makers James Cropper. Standing: He has returned to standing position, but keeps his head bowed in the presence of royalty . Her Majesty and the Princess Royal . were given an insight into the business’ daily operations and met young . apprentices before unveiling a plaque to open the new £5m recycling . plant. 'They were both really interested in what we were doing and asked lots of questions,' said Mark Starrs, a colour co-ordinator. 'I was put at ease very quickly.' The Royal Party then travelled to Bowness, where they were greeted with flags, bunting and a very excited crowd. Those . assembled clamoured for the chance to speak to Her Majesty, who was . presented with gifts and posies, before setting out on old-fashioned . steamer, MV Teal. Her Stewart Parvin outfit was complemented by the sparkling waters of Windermere on the 15-minute sail, which took her to the Lake District Visitor Centre at Brockhole. Royalists: The Queen attracted hundreds of well-wishers as she toured the north. Pictured here at a school in Windermere . There, she met several local . dignitaries and told schoolchildren she hoped Prince William and the . Duchess of Cambridge’s baby would be born ‘soon’. The visitors did not go home hungry after lunch at Miller Howe Hotel, Windermere. On . the menu was local smoked salmon with Morecambe Bay potted shrimps, . Cumbrian spring lamb and for dessert, raspberry and lemon tart. Manager Nigel Williamson said: 'We had cheated a little because we looked up online what the Queen did and did not like, and found that lamb was her favourite. 'But they both seemed to enjoy all of the dishes, and spoke to all the staff afterwards. It was such an honour.' After a day packed with smiles and laughter, mother and daughter embraced before making separate journeys home. Smiles: The Queen met the players before start of play of the second Ashes test match between England and Australia . Hand shaking: Queen Elizabeth II was introduced to all of the players in both teams before the game began . Respect: The Queen shakes hands with England's Kevin Pietersen at Lord's Cricket Ground, London . Her Majesty once again boarded the Royal train and waved goodbye to station staff, police and members of the public, while the Princess was ushered into an escort car and driven away. England and Australia's cricketers were also all smiles as they met the Queen before going head-to-head in another eagerly anticipated Ashes Test match. The monarch walked out on to the famous pitch at Lord's cricket ground to meet the batsmen and bowlers who were lined up ahead of the day's play. The famous ground is the home of cricket and is owned by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) - the guardians of the laws and spirit of the game. Legendary: The famous ground is the home of cricket and is owned by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) - the guardians of the laws and spirit of the game . Delighted: Members of both teams were seen to be ecstatic to have met Her Majesty . Greeting: Queen Elizabeth II is introduced to the Australian team by captain Michael Clarke . Privilege: Queen Elizabeth II meets MCC members inside the Committee Room of the Pavilion at Lord's Cricket Ground . It will celebrate its bicentenary next year after being established by cricketer and businessman Thomas Lord in 1814. As the last of the sell-out crowds took their seats for the second Test, England captain Alistair Cook introduced the Queen to his players. Among the team were the leading performers of the first Test at Trent Bridge which England won - bowler Jimmy Anderson, who took the last wicket in a nailbiting finish, and batsman Ian Bell, who scored a century. As much as the Queen will have enjoyed the respect shown by the Fijian soldier yesterday, there have sadly been several other occasions where royal protocol have been ignored by those meeting her. In 2011, then Australian prime minister Julia Gillard was accused of disrespect over her failure to curtsey to the Queen. A rule concerning the sovereign has also been set in stone for generations: . 'Whatever you do, don't touch the Queen,' courtiers often warn. But during . a G20 reception at Buckingham Palace in 2009, Michelle Obama put her . hand around the Queen for about 10 seconds (below). Finding . herself next to Mrs Obama, the Queen had remarked on their height . difference. As she did so, her hand edged towards the small of Mrs . Obama's back. Mrs Obama responded - and even rubbed the Queen's shoulder . - before both women moved gently apart. In . May 2011, during the Queen's first official visit to the Republic of Ireland, . Irish president Mary McAleese, like Miss Gillard, greeted the Queen . with a simple handshake. Miss Gillard, however, is not even the first  Australian prime minister to have breached royal protocol. In . 1992 Paul Keating (right) was given the nickname of 'Lizard of Oz' after he . touched the Queen's lower back with his arm as he guided her through a . crowd of people. In 2000 another Australian premier, John Howard, denied touching the monarch as he introduced her to MPs at a VIP reception . In 2010, while visiting Canada, racehorse owner Don Romeo put his hand on . her back as she handed a trophy to the owner of the winning horse at the . Queen's Plate Stakes in Toronto. His . breach of protocol was swiftly corrected, however, when his . Jockey, Eurico Da Silva, executed two bows so low that his head was . level with the Queen's waist (below) So how should one behave? There . are no obligatory codes of behaviour when meeting the Queen or members . of the Royal Family, but many people wish to observe tradition. For men this is a neck bow (from the head only) whilst women execute a small . curtsey. For those who prefer, it is in fact perfectly acceptable simply to shake hands. On . presentation to the Queen, the correct formal address is 'Your Majesty' and subsequently 'Ma'am'. For male royals the same rules apply, with the . title used in the first instance being 'Your Royal Highness' and . subsequently 'Sir'. For other female members of the Royal Family the first address is . conventionally 'Your Royal Highness' followed by 'Ma'am'.

"By . Leon Watson . Gun battles erupted between Thai police and anti-government protesters in Bangkok today killing four people and wounding dozens of others. In a day of tangled developments in Thailand's long-running political crisis, the country's anti-corruption body announced it was filing charges against Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra relating to a rice subsidy scheme that has fuelled middle-class opposition to her government. The troubled rice scheme, already near collapse, suffered another blow when the Government Savings Bank said it was scrapping a loan to a state farm bank that could have been used to prop the scheme up in the face of a revolt by depositors. The clashes were some of most intense between protesters and security forces since the campaign to unseat Yingluck began in November, and raised the prospect that the army might feel compelled to intervene if the bloodshed worsens.

National Security Council Chief Paradorn . Pattanathabutr said top officials were meeting to decide whether to . continue the operation on Wednesday. There has been no move against the biggest protest sites in the city's commercial and shopping districts. The . protesters are trying to oust Yingluck, whom they view as a proxy for . her elder brother Thaksin, a former telecoms tycoon-turned-premier, . toppled by the army in a 2006 coup.

"By . Tamara Cohen, Political Correspondent . MIchael Gove last night accused Nick Clegg of  having a split personality over school reforms, veering between ‘Good Nick’ and ‘Nasty Nick’. The Education Secretary said the Deputy Prime Minister pandered to disaffected Left-wing voters by attacking the reforms he once backed. It escalates an acrimonious rift in the Government over schools policy since Mr Gove decided to sack Labour-supporting Baroness Morgan as head of Ofsted last week. Schools row: Education Secretary Michael Gove, left, accused Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg of pandering to disaffected Left-wing voters by attacking the reforms he once backed . Mr Gove said some Lib Dems wanted to ‘emphasise differences’ within the Coalition to appeal to former supporters ‘who don’t agree with the changes we are making now’. ‘Good Nick, the angel on one shoulder, is saying, “What Gove is doing is socially progressive, socially mobile, and in tune with good old Gladstonian principles”,’ he said. ‘Wicked Nick,  sitting on his other shoulder, is saying, “Yes! But some of your more radical activists dislike it, so pander to them”. 'He will have to decide whether it’s the good or the bad Nick that he indulges.’ It comes after Lib Dem Schools Minister David Laws rekindled the Coalition row over education by confirming for the first time that he had opposed the sacking of Sally Morgan. In an interview, Mr Laws hit  out at Mr Gove over his decision to axe Baroness Morgan from the schools regulator. He then opened a new rift by saying a system was needed to prevent cronyism in appointments, since any suggestion that a watchdog was pursuing a political agenda was ‘fatal’. Lib Dem Schools Minister David Laws rekindled the Coalition row over education by confirming he had opposed the sacking of Sally Morgan . Mr Gove insisted the decision not to renew Baroness Morgan’s contract was not based on her politics – she is an ex-aide to Tony Blair – but because he wanted a ‘new perspective’. But he refused to rule out appointing a Tory donor, Theodore Agnew, who runs a chain of academies, to head the watchdog instead. Yesterday Mr Laws, who rarely speaks to the media, admitted he was not consulted about the move, and said he wished Baroness Morgan had remained in post. ‘I don’t think it is one of the best decisions Michael Gove has ever made,’ he told The Independent. ‘I personally think that Sally Morgan has done a fantastic job as chair of Ofsted. I would rather she had remained and had her term renewed. 'We just cannot end up in a situation where posts of this type are selected on the basis of which political party you are in rather than your competence for the job. ‘While no organisation is ever going to be perfect, it is important that there should be confidence in Ofsted and it should be seen to be arm’s length from  politicians. 'Otherwise people [working] in schools or early years would be able to say it is pursuing an agenda that is not about educational standards. That would be fatal. It has got to be independent.’ Mr Laws was previously seen as united with Mr Gove on the schools agenda, but relations between them now appear strained. He said that when he was told of the decision to axe Baroness Morgan he demanded an equal say over the make-up of the panel to choose her successor. He also suggested the academies programme, vastly expanded by Mr Gove, could do with more scrutiny – and called for powers for Ofsted to investigate chains of academy schools. Academies now account for 54 per cent of state secondary schools after massive growth spearheaded by the Tories.","Row escalates an acrimonious rift in the Government over schools policy .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . Life of luxury: UKIP leader Nigel Farage is using taxpayers' money to pay for a swanky penthouse suite in Brussels, it has been revealed . UKIP leader Nigel Farage has come under fire for using taxpayers' money to pay for a swanky penthouse suite in Brussels. The Euro MP, who has previously criticised the European Union for its wastefulness, is renting the luxury property in one of the most exclusive addresses in the Belgian capital. It is thought to be worth a staggering £500,000 - featuring two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a garage and a private cellar. It even boasts cleaners and a porter, while a balcony offers incredible views of Brussels's skyline. The 49-year-old sleeps in the taxpayer-funded suite, which is owned by a Dutch diplomat, twice a month, according to The Sun on Sunday. This is despite him previously delivering vehement attacks on the EU 'gravy train' - slamming the excesses of European politicans as wasteful and unnecessary. The suite, situated on the top floor of a 15-storey block, built in the 1930s, is within walking distance of the European Union Parliament and a number of posh bars and restaurants. It is owned by the family of Dutch ambassador to the Philippines, Gijsbert Anton Boon Von Ochssee. Today, Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, condemned Mr Farage's use of taxpayer's money to pay for the luxury accommodation in Brussels. He told MailOnline: 'After the public outcry over MPs' expenses back in 2009, it is high time that MEPs were subject to the same scrutiny over how they are spending taxpayers' hard-earned cash. Speech: The Euro MP, who has condemned the European Union for its wastefulness, is renting theproperty in one of the most exclusive addresses in the Belgian capital. Above, Mr Farage at the UKIP Spring Conference . 'MEPs . clearly need a place to stay when they are representing their . constituents in Brussels, but they must make arrangements that offer . best value for taxpayers' money. 'If . some MEPs are only staying overnight in Belgium a couple of nights each . month, several questions are sure to pop into people's minds: if they . are doing the job properly, shouldn't they be in Brussels for more then . two nights a month, and if they are only staying overnight twice a . month, wouldn't it be cheaper to stay in a hotel?' Last night, Mr Farage, who earns a hefty £77,000 salary plus expenses, said he only stayed in the penthouse suite while working in Brussels as an MEP. Denial: It comes as Mr Farage (left) has vehemently denied having sex with his aide Annabelle Fuller (right) 'I do occasionally stay there,' he said. 'The alternative would be a smart hotel'. He added that he did not have a . rental deal in his name with anyone - and did not know whose name the . suite's rental agreement was in. Mr Boon Von Ochssee was unavailable for comment. Mr . Farage is believed to have previously shared the apartment with former . UKIP colleague, Godfrey Bloom, 64, who reportedly moved out after losing . the party's whip in September last year. It . comes as the Euro MP has vehemently denied having sex with his aide . Annabelle Fuller, whom he was alleged to have been involved with. Mr Farage spoke out after it was claimed UKIP press officer Ms Fuller was his 'former mistress', and he was using public funds to employ her and his German wife and £25,000-a-year assistant, Kirsten Farrage, . He also dismissed claims that his 14-year marriage to Mrs Farage is in trouble as a result of recent headlines about his . so-called ‘womanising’.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Uganda could soon be jailing homosexuals for life after the president said he intended to sign an anti-gay bill. It comes after Yoweri Museveni received a report from ‘medical experts’ saying ‘homosexuality is not genetic but a social behaviour’, a government spokesman wrote on Twitter. Homosexuality, which Museveni has called abnormal, is a crime in Uganda. The bill, approved by parliament in December, would legalise life imprisonment for some acts. Yoweri Museveni, the Ugandan president, is poised to sign a law which would make some homosexual acts punishable by up to life in prison . Museveni announced his decision to . governing party lawmakers, said government spokesman Ofwono Opondo. In . Twitter posts on Friday, Opondo said the legislators, who are holding a . retreat chaired by Museveni, 'welcomed the development as a measure to . protect Ugandans from social deviants.' Evelyn Anite, a spokeswoman for the governing party, said the report, which had been requested by the president, was prepared by more than a dozen scientists from Uganda's Health Ministry. Opondo and Anite both said the president did not indicate when he will sign the legislation into law. Homosexuality already is illegal in Uganda under a colonial-era law that criminalizes sex acts 'against the order of nature.' An earlier version of the bill, first introduced in 2009, proposed the death penalty for some homosexual acts, although that sentence was removed after international pressure. The bill is popular in Uganda, one of many sub-Saharan African countries where homosexuals face severe discrimination.  A new law in Nigeria last month increased penalties against gays. Museveni, who has criticized gays as 'abnormal' people who should be 'rehabilitated,' had previously called the bill too harsh. Government spokesman Ofwono Opondo tweeted the announcement saying he welcomed the measure to protect the country from 'social deviants' Ugandan lawmakers passed it on Dec. 20. Since then Museveni has been under pressure within his own party to sign the legislation, which has wide support among Christian clerics and lawmakers who say it is needed to deter Western homosexuals from 'recruiting' Ugandan children. The bill before Museveni would allow life imprisonment for acts of 'aggravated homosexuality,' defined as sex acts where one of the partners is infected with HIV, sex with minors or the disabled, and repeated sexual offenses among consenting adults. Russian President Vladimir Putin recently passed a law banning gay 'propaganda', also arguing the measure was to protect children . The bill also would make conducting a same-sex marriage ceremony punishable by seven years in prison. On Friday, the watchdog group Human Rights First expressed 'deep concern' over news that the bill will be signed into law, saying it 'will have severely adverse consequences for the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people as well as other Ugandans.' Robyn Lieberman of Human Rights First said: 'There should be no doubt that Museveni's latest words on the subject have been influenced by the reaction to similar legislation in Nigeria, Russia and elsewhere.' Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin said: 'Unless this bill is stopped from becoming law, lives will be destroyed and countless people will be punished for an immutable characteristic.' He addded: 'Anti-LGBT Americans advocated for laws further criminalizing LGBT people in Uganda, and it looks like they are now getting their wish. 'Whether it's Brian Brown advocating for anti-LGBT laws in Russia or Scott Lively calling for the further criminalization of LGBT people in Uganda, anti-LGBT Americans must stop exporting their hate abroad.' Brown is president of the National Organization for Marriage, a Washington-based group that opposes same-sex marriage. A Russian law, signed by President Vladimir Putin in June, bans gay 'propaganda' from reaching minors. The law has drawn strong international criticism and calls for a boycott of the Sochi Games from gay activists and others.","Yoweri Musaveni to sign law which would punish some acts with life .

"By . Sami Mokbel . Jose Mourinho claimed on Friday that Manchester United are ready to sell Wayne Rooney in the summer. The Chelsea manager cranked up the heat ahead of Sunday's Barclays Premier League clash against United by suggesting Old Trafford chiefs will look to offload Rooney to an overseas club at the end of the season. Rooney is expected to miss Sunday's game with a groin injury but United are considering risking him and he could travel with the team. On his way? Mourinho claims Rooney could be off in the summer, but most likely to a European side . It's top secret: Mourinho's Chelsea are third in the Premier League table, nine points ahead of United . Elsewhere: Mourinho claims United are not willing to sell Rooney to a direct rival in the Premier League . Mourinho remains interested in the England striker, having failed in a bid to land him last summer, but he said: ‘United were clear in the way they approached the Rooney situation. ‘They don’t swap. They don’t sell. I don’t see that changing, they were very clear about that. ‘Will it be the same this summer? I think maybe this summer they will try to sell to a non-direct rival. But they were very clear, not to a domestic direct rival.’ Mourinho will return for Rooney at the end of the season but his barbs at United are not likely to help his attempts to land the forward. The Chelsea boss said earlier this week he had inside information about the mood at Old Trafford. One up, one down: Rooney's overall performances have improved under David Moyes, but United's haven't . Tough at the top: Mourinho was in typical form at a press conference on Friday ahead of Sunday's match . Not happy: Mourinho says his opinion of United is based on his words with Sir Alex Ferguson over the years . The Portuguese told London’s Evening Standard newspaper: ‘My feeling, which is based on years of communicating with Sir Alex and some inside information, is Man United are not happy, but they are calm.’ David Moyes, whose side trail third-placed Chelsea by nine points, yesterday said Mourinho had apologised to him for those comments. ‘I have seen it and I have had an apology from the Chelsea media department and from Jose.’ Moyes refused to be drawn about the possible departure of Rooney but said he would not talk about players at rival clubs. ‘I wouldn’t do it but everybody has their own style,’ said Moyes. ‘I can’t tell you what Jose’s motivation is but only time will give you the answer about Wayne.’ Previous: Moyes and Mourinho met for a 0-0 draw in August at Old Trafford - a drab affair . Rocky: Rooney's relationship with Ferguson was tentative in the final years of the Scot's tenure at United . Rooney has 18 months left on his contract, meaning United may be forced to sell him this summer to ensure they do not lose him for nothing at the end of next season. But Moyes, who revealed Rooney has returned to light training at the club’s Carrington HQ following a warm-weather break in Egypt,  re-iterated the club will try to extend the striker’s deal. He said: ‘The club will deal with that. They will do all the things they need to do, no question.’ Mourinho yesterday revealed Sir Alex Ferguson told him he was retiring two weeks before making the decision public. Raising a smile: Rooney (centre) poses with fans during a break from his warm weather training in Egypt . The pair have a close relationship off the pitch and Mourinho admitted he was nervous when Ferguson trusted him with his secret. ‘I knew a couple of weeks before the announcement because my friend (Ferguson) was nice to me and trusted me completely,’ said the Chelsea boss. ‘He told me something really important before the press. He said I was one of his best friends in football so he wanted me to know before I read about it. ‘I was afraid because I was sure someone might leak and the boss might think it had come from me. But it would never have. ‘It was the same way he knew from me I was coming back to Chelsea.’ Doing the business: Danny welbeck has lead United's attack in Rooney and Van Persie's absence .","Chelsea boss insists United will try to offload Wayne Rooney this summer .

Presenter Phillip Schofield comforts Naomi Oni today on This Morning where she spoke about the attack . Naomi Oni said Mary Konye, who had been her friend since the age of 11, had become 'obsessed' with her, trying to emulate her looks, trying to steal her boyfriend before attempting to 'destroy' her .

Naomi Oni before she had acid thrown in her face . Recalling how her 'friend' acted throughout her ordeal, Miss Oni said: 'The morning of the day it happened. 'I remember that she messaged me and I spoke to her in the evening and told her what happened. 'She seemed shocked and told me she wanted to come and see me in hospital.' She added: 'When I first had some surgery, I remember crying on the phone to her asking ""who would do this to me, who hates me? I would never wish this on my worst enemy"". 'She told me not to worry, that I'd be okay and she even attended my surprise birthday party and got me flowers and a gift card. 'She sat beside me and cried and everything. How do I feel about her now? I think she's a sad person. 'I think I will always be the person I was and no one can stop me from that. 'And like I said before I even knew it was her, whatever the person tried to do, they failed, and I stand by it. She failed and will continue to be an amazing person.' A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'All lines of enquiry were considered in the early stages of the investigation. 'The investigation was detailed and complex and officers had a duty to explore every avenue of enquiry and retain an open mind about the circumstances. 'They carried out numerous actions including door-to-door enquiries, leaflet drops, searches, interviews and forensic analyses.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 10:47 EST, 15 December 2011 . The £13m boss of Lloyds signed off sick from work because of exhaustion, it has emerged. Antonio Horta-Osorio, who pocketed a £4.6million golden hello when he joined the bank, stood aside on medical advice six weeks ago after suffering insomnia, the firm revealed yesterday. But in a major surprise for the city, the former Santander chief announced he was planning to return to the office on January 9. Exhausted: Lloyds chief Antonio Horta-Osorio (pictured with his wife Ana) signed off work after suffering sleep deprivation . The news came as Lloyds Banking Group named the Co-operative as its preferred choice to buy the 632 branches it is selling under European competition rules. A Lloyds spokesman said Mr Horta-Osorio had been working so hard he found it hard to switch off and couldn't sleep. 'When he started, he threw himself into the job, working like a dog, he told The Daily Mirror. But Sir Win Bischoff, the chairman of the 41 per cent taxpayer-owned company, said Mr Horta-Osorio was 'bushy-tailed' at the prospect of coming back to work. It follows Lord Tebbit’s claims in the House of Lords that the threat of legal action should hang over company bosses as a way of 'asserting the rights' of shareholders. The bank will now enter into exclusive discussions with the Co-op, which beat off competition in the auction from NBNK Investments, a takeover vehicle run by former Northern Rock boss Gary Hoffman. Feeling better: Mr Horta-Osorio hopes to return to the office on January, much to the surprise of the City . The decision to start exclusive talks with the Co-op did not involve Mr Horta-Osorio, the company said. Lloyds is being forced to divest the branches because of the £20 billion in state aid it received following the 2008 financial crisis. The assets being sold account for a 4.6per cent share of the UK current account market and up to 19per cent of the group's mortgage book. There are five million customers and an estimated 9,000 employees.",Antonio Horta-Osorio had been working 'like a dog'
"By . Liz  Hull . Colin Scarisbrick, pictured leaving Liverpool Crown Court, has 30 driving offences dating back 22 years . A van driver who killed a father-of-two in a fit of road rage had caused a death on the roads before, it emerged yesterday. Colin Scarisbrick tailgated school caretaker Jeff Argent before deliberately ramming his car. The impact sent the smaller vehicle crashing into a lamppost and Mr Argent, 49, died at the scene in Merseyside. After Scarisbrick was found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving this week it emerged that he has more than 30 motoring convictions dating back to when he was 17. In 1999 he caused the death of passenger Damien Tudor, 20, after driving at speeds of up to 100mph through the village of Ystalyfera near Swansea. Father-of-one Mr Tudor died when the car crashed at 70mph – a speed Scarisbrick had reached even after his tyres were deflated by a police stinger device. But even though Scarisbrick, 39, was jailed for seven and a half years and banned from driving for a decade, he successfully applied to have his licence restored in September 2007. His other motoring convictions include at least 12 for driving while disqualified, car theft, joyriding and driving with no insurance. Judge Denis Watson, QC, warned the baker that he faces a ‘substantial’ jail term when he is sentenced for the latest offence next month. ‘You have been convicted of a very, very serious offence on overwhelming evidence,’ the judge said. ‘This is not the first time that you have caused death behind the wheel.’ Liverpool Crown Court was told that Scarisbrick had been on his way to work last October when he encountered Mr Argent’s silver Renault Clio in Formby. Motorist Jennifer Reid described how Scarisbrick’s red VW van was tailgating the smaller car and seemed to be trying to intimidate the driver. The two men exchanged words when they pulled up at traffic lights before Scarisbrick cut up Mr Argent at a following roundabout, clipping the passenger side of his car in the process. The Clio then spun across two lanes, before mounting the pavement and smashing down the lamppost. Mr Argent, a primary school caretaker in Crosby, died at the scene while Scarisbrick, of no fixed address, sped off to work. Heart of gold: School caretaker and father-of-two Jeff Argent, pictured with his wife Debbie, died after Scarisbrick tailgated him and deliberately rammed his car . CCTV showed him later checking the paintwork on his van and when he was arrested he asked officers: ‘Is this about that stupid thing this morning?’ He later admitted cutting up the Clio but claimed he feared Mr Argent was going to beat him up. Speaking after the verdict, Mr Argent’s father-in-law Colin McKenna said: ‘If you’re frightened of somebody, you run away don’t you? Jeff was 6ft 5in tall and had a big heart. He was daft as a brush and was a Mr Softy. We miss him so much.’ Mr Argent had been hailed as a ‘top ambassador’ for his home town of Southport after winning a tourism award. His wife of 19 years, Debbie, 45, said he was devoted to their two children – Ryan, 20, and 16-year-old Jess. She added: ‘We were his life and he is ours. Jeff was the life and soul of any party. ‘He had a mischievous sense of humour and would make fun of people to make them laugh. He was a big man with a big personality and had a heart of gold.’ Prosecutor Helen Graves branded Scarisbrick a ‘danger to all road users.’ She added: ‘On that fateful day in October last year, his temper got the better of him again and he drove an innocent man off the road and into a lamppost where he met his death.’","Colin Scarisbrick deliberately rammed Jeff Argent's car, killing him .

Ten miners emerged from the mine shaft near Johannesburg on Monday, one day after emergency responders rescued a group of 11, the South African Press Association reported. The men were in good health and rescue workers handed them over to police. Emergency workers said other miners who were working illegally at the site near Johannesburg refused to come out of the shaft because they feared arrest. Scroll down for video .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . A 44-year-old woman who nearly caused two police officers to crash while they were on their way to an emergency call, told officers she was 'awesome' and asked if they wanted to dance. Julie Kay Harper, who was pulled over in the early hours of Saturday after nearly driving into a car, admitted to having a few beers with a friend before driving home. The Florida woman, who told police she thought she was in trouble, was arrested for driving under the influence after failing a roadside sobriety test. Arrested: Julie Harper said she was too fat to walk in a straight line when asked to do a roadside sobriety test . Police were first alerted to Harper as they responded to a call about a house being burgled on Saturday, according to TC Palm. Her driving allegedly caused two police cars to swerve out the way as she negotiated a turn in the road, police reports said. When a Sergeant with the Indian River County's sheriff's office approached Harper in her car, and asked how she was, she replied 'awesome'. The officer who first stopped Harper allegedly had to reach in her car and put it in 'park' after the woman let her foot off the brake of the car, causing it to lurch forwards. When the 44-year-old was asked where she lived she told officers '53' adding that she had lived there for 'a minute'. As the Sergeant asked her to confirm she had lived there only sixty seconds she said: 'That's it, yeah I know I'm f*****,' before adding that she felt like she was in trouble. Matters took a turn for the worse for Harper after she was asked to complete a roadside sobriety test, which included following a light with her eyes and walking in a straight line. When the Sergeant asked her to follow the light with her eyes she chucked and asked 'Are we gonna dance' before swaying in a small circular fashion as she continued the test, the police report showed. And, as she attempted to walk in a straight line she complained: 'I can't, my fat, my legs are fat.' Finally, the police asked her to stand on one leg which, after failing to do, Harper said: 'It's not gonna happen. Just f****** take me to jail.' Harper refused a chemical breath test when she was taken to the police station. She was also charged with driving an unlicensed car on a suspended license.","44-year-old from Florida complains she is too fat to walk in straight line .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Three Mexican migrants were found squeezed together inside a wooden box in the back of a camper van when it was stopped by Border Patrol at a checkpoint near the California-Mexico border. Agents discovered the illegal immigrants after a Border Patrol sniffer dog raised the alarm when the vehicle was stopped near Indio, in the Coachella Valley. The trio were stuffed tight in a storage compartment beneath a bed in the camper van. A wooden lid had been tightly screwed into place above them. Stuffed tight: Mexicans crouch in a box after being discovered in a storage compartment under the bed of a recreational vehicle near San Diego as they tried to make their way illegally into the U.S. When agents unscrewed the lid they found three males, aged 17, 19, and 21, folded over inside the box. The vehicle's 23-year-old male driver and an 18-year-old female passenger, both U.S. citizens, were arrested on suspicion of migrant smuggling. The discovery came as a Mexican woman who received widespread attention for taking refuge in a Chicago church before she was deported in 2007 was released from U.S. custody. Elvira Arellano, 38, was paroled with her 5-month-old son, Emiliano, two days after they openly crossed the border in a challenge to the Obama administrations record numbers of deportations. They are among about 150 people who have sought to enter the country without legal documents at San Diego's Otay Mesa port of entry since last week in protest at U.S. immigration policies. Many planned to claim asylum. The vehicle's 23-year-old male driver and an 18-year-old female passenger, both U.S. citizens, were arrested . 'We are pleased to be here with friends who have helped us,' said Ms Arellano. 'We are going to continue fighting for other fathers and mothers to also be freed.' People who claim fear of persecution are often released from custody while they wait for a judge to decide their cases. It was unclear how many protesters who crossed in San Diego were in custody and how many were paroled. Immigrant rights activist Elvira Arellano waits in Tijuana, Mexico, to enter into the U.S. where she planned to ask for asylum. She is famous for spending a year in a church basement as she fought deportation in 2007 . Unlike similar protests last year in Arizona and Texas, many were not 'dreamers' — young adults who came to the U.S. as children and were raised here but who were subsequently thrown out by immigration rulings. Some, like Ms Arellano, were parents of young children, while others were indeed 'dreamers', Democracy Now reported. Ms Arellano said she would return to Chicago, where she has an immigration hearing next month. She reunited yesterday with her 15-year-old son who was born in the U.S. and joined her crossing the border two days earlier. For years, Ms Arellano has been an outspoken critic of U.S. immigration laws and and President Barack Obama for the roughly 2million deportations that have occurred during his administration. During marches last week in Tijuana, she rallied the crowd with a bullhorn. Brave: Ms Arellano leads the way through the metal turnstyle during the protest against U.S. immigration policies in which she was joined by around 150 others who were seeking asylum in the country . Ms Arellano hired a smuggler to come to the U.S. illegally in the Nineties and, after three years in Yakima, Washington, moved to Chicago, where she cleaned airplanes for a contractor at O'Hare International Airport. She was arrested in an immigration sting in 2002 but rather than surrender to immigration authorities, she took refuge at the Adalberto United Methodist Church in Chicago in August 2006. She left after more than a year for a publicity tour that that took her to Los Angeles, where authorities arrested her near a church and swiftly deported her to Tijuana. The latest discovery comes only a day after police in Texas found a stash house crammed full with more than 100 suspected illegal immigrants.The boarded up house in Houston was so full that the occupants were sitting on top of each other and were surrounded by trash bags filled with old clothing.It is thought many of the 108 men and women found inside the 1,500sq ft home had been brought there under a human smuggling operation.","Trio were squeezed together inside storage compartment beneath a bed .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said employers should try to hire a British worker first . British firms should ‘try one of our unemployed people first’ before looking to hire foreign workers, Iain Duncan Smith has claimed. The Work and Pensions Secretary said more jobs were now going to people born in the UK after years of cheap labour from overseas undercutting Brits. However, European law makes it illegal to discriminate against workers from elsewhere in the EU. The number of UK-born workers in a job rose by 1.1 per cent in the last quarter of 2013, but among foreign-born workers it rose by 3.3 per cent to 4.45million. Since January 2007, the number of UK-born workers in a job has risen by 1.1million but only 153,000 among Brits. But Mr Duncan Smith said: ‘Now more jobs are going to British workers than went originally. So that is the beginning of a change, but I’m very keen to thrash that out so “try one of our unemployed people first before you go anywhere else”.’ He revealed his shock at the message people trying to find work near the London Olympics. ‘I was in a Job Centre at the time of the Olympics in my area of Waltham Forest. We were in the Olympic boroughs and there’s a big debate about how much work actually went to those boroughs,’ he told the House magazine. ‘I was talking to a plumber and a carpenter, trained, qualified individuals. And I asked them about the Olympic sites. ‘And they said: “They’re all or mostly people coming in from Eastern Europe who undercut us because they all hotbed in these areas and then they’re gone. I can’t compete with them on this because I’ve got a house, I’ve got kids, I’ve got commitments, there’s only so far I can go on salary, otherwise it’s worse for me than being on benefits”.’ But Tim Aker, Ukip's head of policy, said: 'If the government were serious about British jobs for British people, then why are they currently advertising nearly a million jobs on the EU's job mobility portal to workers from across the whole EU? 'The fact is that only Ukip will prioritise British workers for these jobs by pulling out of the EU and ending open border immigration.' Earlier this month new Tory immigration minister James Brokenshire caused a storm when he claimed middle class families had enjoyed the benefits of cheap foreign labour, but the working classes had been squeezed out of jobs. Mr Brokenwshire said: ‘For too long, the benefits of immigration went to employers who wanted an easy supply of cheap labour; or to the wealthy metropolitan elite who wanted cheap tradesmen and services – but not to the ordinary, hard-working people of this country. We are changing that and building a system that benefits all.' Since January 2007, the number of UK-born workers in a job has risen by 1.1million but only 153,000 among Brits . But the speech sparked a storm of controversy, when it emerged David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Home Secretary Theresa May had all hired foreign staff as cleaners or nannies. Mr Duncan Smith defended Mr Brokenshire, adding: ‘He was saying the benefits of this, such as they are, tended to be in this group but not down at the bottom end, where they’ve tended to see the problem. He’s right in that by the way. ‘That is the issue. People that I deal with every day, they feel very squeezed by people who come in, under cut them in price.’","Work and Pensions Secretary urges companies to hire UK workers .

Defends immigration minister over attack on 'metropolitan elites'"
"By . James Chapman . Argentina reacted with fury last night at calls for the capital of the Falkland Islands to be renamed Port Margaret in honour of its liberator. The country’s foreign minister Héctor Timerman insisted a move to rename Port Stanley, also known simply as Stanley, would be in breach of United Nations resolutions and would not be recognised by his country. ‘I couldn’t care less if they call it Port Margaret, Margarita or Margarona,’ he declared. ‘Argentina and the United Nations will not recognise it.’ Liberator: Margaret Thatcher stands proudly on Victory Green in Port Stanley during her visit to the Falklands in June 1992. She was there to mark the 10th anniversary of the Falklands War . The Mail revealed that senior MPs are suggesting that the Falklands capital should be renamed Port Margaret in honour of Lady Thatcher, who ordered the military campaign to save it from Argentine invasion in 1982. Port Stanley is currently named after Edward Smith-Stanley, who was the British prime minister three times in the mid-19th century, but never actually set foot in the Falklands. Renaming it after Lady Thatcher would infuriate Argentina’s erratic president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, who has been making increasingly provocative remarks about the sovereignty of the islands around the 30th anniversary of the conflict. But bookmakers are offering odds of 5/1 that islanders would agree to bestowing the honour on the woman who many still hero-worship. Argentina refers to the Falklands as Las Malvinas and to Port Stanley as Puerto Argentino. Mr Timerman insisted changing the name of Port Stanley would breach United Nations resolutions. ‘[The resolutions] say that sides must . abstain from making changes in the conflict zone that alter its status . quo at the time the conflict began,’ he insisted. Against: Renaming it after Lady Thatcher would infuriate Argentina's erratic president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, who has been making increasingly provocative remarks about the sovereignty of the islands . ‘Britain keeps violating UN resolutions. Then they use those same resolutions to bomb other countries.’ Tobias Ellwood, a Parliamentary aide at the Foreign Office who led a successful campaign to have the tower that houses Big Ben renamed the Elizabeth Tower in honour of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee, insisted dedicating the capital to Lady Thatcher would be appropriate, as long as the islanders agree. 'Britain keeps violating UN resolutions. Then they use those same resolutions to bomb other countries' Héctor Timerman, Argentina's foreign minister . ‘Thatcher’s legacy may be complex but the primary role she played in the Falklands chapter is undisputed - renaming Stanley Port Margaret would be a fitting tribute,’ Mr Ellwood said. Former Tory chairman Lord Tebbit, one of Lady Thatcher’s closest allies, said renaming the capital was a ‘matter for the Falkland Islands’. But he added: ‘If there is not already a . memorial to her in the islands, there should be, and if the Argentines . would like us to put one up in Buenos Aires I’m sure someone will . oblige. 'She did get rid of the junta for them, . after all, which is something the Argentine ambassador of the day . thanked me for profusely.’ Respect: The Falkland Islands flag flies at half mast in front of the Visitor Centre after Baroness Thatcher died . Sharon Bulic Zuvic, a fourth-generation Falkland islander, agreed: ‘It would be a fitting tribute. As long as a majority of people here agreed, I think it could be a good thing.’ 'If there is not already a memorial to her in the islands, there should be, and if the Argentines would like us to put one up in Buenos Aires I’m sure someone will oblige' Lord Tebbit, Former Tory chairman . Alison Howe, owner of Harbour View Gift Shop in Stanley, said: ‘Falkland Islanders tend to think a lot before making a decision - they never rush into things. So like them I would have to think about the idea first. We’re all forever grateful to Thatcher.’ Mr Timerman also insisted that he did not care that neither he or Mrs Kirchner had been invited to Lady Thatcher’s funeral next week – with Argentina only invited to send its British ambassador. The snub brackets Argentina with North Korea and Zimbabwe. ‘What do I care if they invite me to a place I hadn’t planned to go?’ Mr Timerman said. ‘The woman died. Let her family hold a wake for her in peace.’ Lady Thatcher will be buried as a war leader next Wednesday, with soldiers that fought in the Falklands War due to accompany her body to St. Paul’s Cathedral.","Senior MPs suggest Port Stanley should be renamed to honour Thatcher .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The 40-year-old African-American New York City man who has been accused in the beating death of an innocent bystander, who was Caucasian, has had a history of racial prejudice, according to his family. Martin Redrick, 40, has been charged with assault in connection to the death of 62-year-old Jeffrey Babbitt, whom police say the suspect punched once in Union Square Park last Wednesday in an unprovoked attack that may have been racially motivated. The victim was struck with such force that the beating left him brain dead. On Monday, Mr Babbitt passed away. Scroll down for video . Collared; Martin Redrick (center), pictured in court Tuesday, has been charged with assault in the death of a passerby . History of violence: Family say Redrick has long been hostile towards white people, suffered from a severe drug addiction and schizophrenia, and has had numerous run-ins with the law . Killed by a single punch: Jeffrey Babbitt, 62, has died at a New York City hospital after being left brain dead when he was punched by a stranger in an alleged racist hate crime . Redrick, who had been wrongly . identified in earlier reports as 31-year-old Lashawn Marten - an alias . he has apparently given to police following his arrest - was said to be . angry at white commuters for bumping into him and was overheard . threatening to punch one before he attacked Babbitt. The deadly confrontation did not come as a surprise to those who know Redrick. His brother Joseph Redrick told the New York Times that as a youth, his younger sibling detested figures of authority, who were exclusively white. Diverse family: Scarlett Thomas, Martin Redrick's former sister-in-law, was the adoptive mother of his son while he was in jail . However, . not all of his interactions with Caucasian Americans were negative: his . own son was adopted by his brother Joseph and his then-wife, Scarlett . Thomas, who is white. Ms . Thomas, who divorced Joseph Redrick in 2009, recalled that Martin was always kind to her daughter from a . previous marriage, whom he called, 'my precious little Snow White.' Mr . Redrick's behavior reportedly took a turn for the worse when he . acquired a drug habit in the 1990s, which turned him unpredictable and . volatile. Over the years, . Mr Redrick has had numerous run-ins with the law, including a 1997 . conviction on an assault charge that landed him in jail first for 6 . months, and then for 16 more as punishment for a probation violation. Redrick had been leading a transient . lifestyle in Newburgh, New York, where the local police became well . acquainted with him, handing him summonses for trespassing and drinking . from an open container. As . time went on, Mr Redrick began showing violent tendencies. In 2002, he . was arrested twice for throwing bottles at police officers, one of him . he also punched in the face. In . 2007, Martin Redrick was diagnosed with schizophrenia, after which he . disappeared, re-emerging only three years later in New York City. Attacked: Mr Babbitt has died following the punch which left him bleeding on the ground last week in New York City . Charged: Lashawn Marten, 31, in custody in a police cruiser He allegedly stood up from a chess table in Union Square Park, said 'I'm going to knock out the next white person who walks by' and assaulted Jeffrey Babbitt . Scarlett . Thomas, his sister-in-law, recalled that Redrick called her last year . out of the blue, seemingly unaware that he had been gone for three . years. Redrick's troubles . with the law did not stop when he moved from Newburgh to Manhattan. He . was arrested in mid-August for allegedly trying to strike a woman in . Harlem and then spitting in her face. Tragic: Mr Babbitt, who was the sole carer for his 92-year-old mother, died in hospital . Martin . Redrick has been living in a home for people with mental illness where . residents can receive help but are free to come and go at will. The . 40-year-old has been spending a lot of time playing chess in Union . Square Park recently. Other chess enthusiasts described him as a quiet . loner who appeared to suffer from mental problems. In . conversations with his opponents, Mr Redrick would at times hint at . past altercations, even boasting about 'knocking' someone out . Last Wednesday, 62-year-old Jeffrey Babbitt, the sole carer of his 92-year-old mother Hedda, was hit so hard that he fell to the ground in Union Square Park but later managed to stand. His condition deteriorated soon afterwards and he died at Bellevue Hospital Monday. His mother Mrs Babbitt, who the retired train . conductor shared a Brooklyn apartment with, had been at his hospital's . bedside since Wednesday. Two other white men, aged 48 and 18, . suffered minor injuries after allegedly being attacked by Redrick as they . tried to help Mr Babbitt who was lying on the ground. Footage of the aftermath of the assault shows the victim on the ground, with blood pouring from his head. Redrick, who has a previous criminal record and uses various aliases, was charged with assault and is due in a Manhattan court on Tuesday. It is likely his charges will now be upgraded. Arrest: Lashawn Marten, seen handcuffed in Union Square, is likely to have his charges upgraded following the death of Mr Babbitt . According to one female witness last week, Redrick said: 'The next white person who . walks by I’m going to f***'. She added: 'His fist went in . and the man’s head bobbed and he hit the ground and you could hear his . skull hitting the ground.' Michael Benson, who also saw that attack, told ABC Local: 'The . guy got agitated for some reason or another and he said, ""The . next white person that bumps into me without saying excuse me, I'm going . to knock him out"".' After his racist rant and attack, witnesses said Redrick stayed at the park and waited for police to arrive. Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said . Redrick's alleged comments about targeting white people before allegedly . punching Mr Babbitt could lead to hate crime charges being made against . him. 'Our Hate Crimes Task Force is involved in aspects of that case,' he added. Redrick is being held on a $1million bond as police decide whether to also charge him with a hate crime.","Martin Redrick, 40, had allegedly shouted racist threats about hitting white people .

"By . Hannah Roberts In Rome . At the age of 76 he became a household name and a magazine cover star. But Pope Francis is apparently desperate to avoid becoming a celebrity – he has ordered the removal of a new life-size statue of him in Buenos Aires cathedral. Since its installation two weeks ago believers visited the statue in the cathedral’s garden to pay homage to the pontiff, while tourists posed for photos alongside it. The statue of Pope Francis is made of fiberglass and is 5' 6'' tall. It was installed at the Buenos Aires' Cathedral at the end of June . Pope Francis has been accused of . encouraging illegal immigration after expressing solidarity with asylum . seekers and economic refugees during his visit to the island of Lampedusa. During his visit on Monday, Francis said . the tens of thousands of migrants from Africa and the Middle East who arrive from Tunisia and Libya should be dealt with compassionately. He said the asylum seekers were 'brothers and sisters of ours trying to escape difficult situations to find some serenity and peace'. But Francis, formerly Archbishop of the Argentine capital, was reportedly horrified at the news. He got straight on the phone and had strong words with the priest responsible telling him: ‘Get that thing down, immediately’, the Argentinian newspaper Clarin reported. Church sources told the newspaper that Francis is determined to avoid creating ‘a cult of personality’ like that enjoyed by John Paul II. Since his election in March, Francis has gone to lengths to be seen as humble, showing little patience for the pomp and fuss that come with his position as head of the world’s 1.2 billion Catholics. The statue was popular with tourists, who often posed alongside it for photographs . Wave goodbye: Pope Francis, seen right during a visit to Lampedusa, Italy, on Monday, wants the statue gone . He rarely wears the robes and trimmings . traditionally allocated to the Pope, continuing instead to wear a simple . white cassock and iron cross. He has refused to move into the luxurious Papal apartments, saying they are too grand, and prefers to live instead in a humble guesthouse for visiting clerics, with whom he eats meals and offers mass every morning. But his new celebrity is unavoidable - especially as the statue’s removal coincides with the naming of Francis as Man of the Year by Vanity Fair magazine’s Italian edition. The magazine gushed: ‘His first 100 days have already placed him in the category of world leaders who make history. But the revolution continues…’ Done without his blessing: The statue is set to be removed, despite its popularity . The announcement was followed by a slew of celebrity endorsements. Elton John commented: 'Francis is a miracle of humility in a an era of vanity.’ The statue, installed ten days ago, was the vision of sculptor Fernando Pugliese, who also created the statues for a Catholic theme park called Holy Land in Argentina. He has previously produced statues of John Paul II and Mother Teresa. It remains to be seen whether a Francis museum at the site, announced two weeks ago, will also be vetoed by the Pope.","Pope told the priest responsible: 'Get that thing down, immediately'

"By . Luke Garratt . Five super-rich families in Britain own more money than the poorest 12 million people in the country combined, according to new research. The research confirms the gap between rich and poor has gotten so wide that even when combined together the bottom fifth of the population cannot match the wealth of the richest in the country. The new figures published by Oxfam reveal that you can count on one hand the households with more wealth than the most deprived 12.6 million Britons, which is nearly the same number as those living below the poverty line. Scroll down for video . Newcastle United's owner Mike Ashley, worth £3.31 billion (left) and Earl Cadogan worth £4.16 billion (right) The top five richest are the Duke of Westminster who is worth £7.83 billion, businessmen brothers David and Simon Reuben worth £6.93bn, the Hinduja brothers worth £6.03bn, Earl Cadogan is worth £4.16bn and Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley worth £3.31bn. These families have a combined wealth of £28.2 billion and the poorest fifth of the UK population only account for £28.1 billion. Over the past 20 years the wealthiest 0.1 percent have seen their income expand almost four times faster than 90 per cent of the least well off. The Duke of Westminster, who is worth £7.83billion . A wealthy elite has seen their income grow by at least £24,000 a year, enough to buy a small yacht or a sports car, while the poorest nine in ten's income has only gone up by just a few pounds a week, with the average UK salary holding at £26,500 a year. Oxfam's director of campaigns and policy Ben Phillips said: 'Britain is becoming a deeply divided nation, with a wealthy elite who are seeing their incomes spiral up, whilst millions of families are struggling to make ends meet. 'It is deeply worrying these extreme levels of wealth inequality exist in Britain today, where just a handful of people have more money than millions struggling to survive on the breadline.' Growing numbers are turning to charity run foodbanks at a time when the highest earners have had the biggest tax cuts of any country in the world. To tackle this the charity urged Chancellor George Osborne to target those who can pay, by clamping down on companies and individuals who avoid paying their share of tax. They also implored that he set out a long term strategy to raise the minimum wage to a living wage, so that many on the poverty line struggling to live can survive. The Hinduja brothers, who are worth £6.03 billion . However, a further £12 billion in welfare cuts has still to be implemented, while political pressure constantly mounts to offer increased tax cuts for the more well off at the next election. Mr Phillips said: 'Increasing inequality is a sign of economic failure rather than success. 'It is far from inevitable - a result of political choices that can be reversed. It is time for our leaders to stand up and be counted on this issue..' The pattern of a rapidly increasing wealth gap between rich and poor is not limited to the UK, and can be seen in most countries across the globe. An Oxfam report published ahead of this year's World Economic Forum in Davos, Working For the Few, revealed the richest 85 people on the planet own the same amount between them as half the world's population - 3.5 billion people. David Reuben (left) and Simon Reuben (right) who together are worth abound £6.93 billion . It warned extreme inequality is creating a vicious circle where wealth concentrated in the hands of a few is used to buy political influence which is used to rig the rules in favour of a small elite and perpetuate inequality. It said extreme inequality like this is to the detriment of social mobility and is also increasingly understood to undermine both the pace and sustainability of economic growth.

"By . John Hall . Scam: Patricia Glancy conned five couples who were getting married at Wentworth Golf Club . A wedding planner who stole £11,000 from couples marrying at one of Britain's top golf clubs has avoided jail because she spent the money on a friend who was dying of cancer . Patricia Glancy, 36, conned five couples into leaving blank cheques with Wentworth Golf Club in Surrey, which she would then cash into her own bank account. Although she admitted stealing the money, Glancy was spared prison after it emerged she spent it on taking her dying friend Thelma Harte on holiday to New York, as well as on large donations to cancer charities. Glancy stole a total of £10,787.50 pounds between March 1 and June 6 last year, and had resigned shortly before the con was discovered by golf club bosses. The scheme was was finally detected when a bride emailed the club about her wedding preparations - only to be told she had not put down a deposit and the organiser had left. Judge Peter Moss, sitting at Guildford Crown Court today sentenced Glancy to six months in prison, suspended for 18 months. The court heard she had paid back every penny of the stolen money and that the golf club had honoured the weddings of all couples that fell victim to the scam. During the trial Judge Moss was handed 'proof' Glancy used to the cash to pay for a trip to New York for a friend, Thelma Harte, who was dying of cancer. Ms Harte is believed to have died before the scam was detected. Glancy also provided evidence that she had used the rest of the money to buy goods from the golf club’s shop, which were sold as items at charity auctions to raise money for two cancer hospices. 'Wentworth Golf Club picked up, as you would expect of a reputable organisation, the costs to fulfill their obligations that fell through because of your fraud. You risked damaging their reputation because of your actions,' said Judge Moss. 'You fully admitted this matter and I bear in mind you are 36 years of age and of good character. Suspended sentence: Patricia Glancy (pictured) was spared jail after it emerged she spent the stolen money taking a dying friend on holiday to New York, as well as making large donations to cancer charities . Money: Guildford Crown Court heard that Wentworth Golf Club (pictured) had honoured all the weddings for couples that found themselves conned out of thousands of pounds by Glancy . 'Your best friend was dying of cancer . and you wanted to provide trips for her to New York and you also . mentioned you had given donations to charity events for two particular . hospices, Judge Moss added. 'You certainly had . bought equipment from the professional shop - at a discount no doubt - . with some of the proceeds you had taken from your customers. 'I saw evidence you had been engaged in those charity events. It attracted, for you personally, a considerable amount of praise and admiration from family and friends. That may well have been the motivation for you.' Glancy, from Ascot in Berkshire, admitted five counts of fraud by false representation at an earlier court appearance. Judge Moss said her crimes deserved custodial punishment but decided to suspend her six-month prison sentence for 18 months. The judge told Glancy that she would immediately serve the six-month term if she committed any further crimes in the next 18 months. Scene: Patricia Glancy conned five couples into leaving blank cheques at the world-famous Wentworth Golf Club in Surrey (pictured). She would then deposit the cheques into her own bank account . He also ordered that she paid £350 pounds costs. Prosecutor Trina Little had earlier told the judge how Glancy worked at Wentworth Golf Club, near Virginia Water, Surrey, from January 16, 2012 to May 31 last year as club’s events sales manager. She said: 'She was tasked to arrange wedding receptions for people getting married at the club and liaised with the parties in doing so.' 'Miss Glancy was asking for deposits. On four of the counts the parties paid by cheques. They left them blank and she said she would stamp them with the Wentworth Golf Club stamp.' 'She completed her name and details.' One payment was made by bank transfer - but instead of giving the club’s details to the couple, Glancy gave her own account number, the prosecutor said. Lisa Patel and Mo Maan had just under £1,940 pounds diverted without their knowledge. Lauren Sandford’s father wrote a cheque for £2,650 pounds as a deposit for his daughter’s wedding to Gary Kearton. Home: Guildford Crown Court heard Patricia Glancy had now repaid all the money she had stolen. Above, Glancy's home in Ascot, Berkshire . A further cheque for an almost identical sum for Daniella Field and Matt Joy’s reception failed to land in the club’s account. Then £1,239 pounds for Nikki Hitchmore and Hooverney Martinez’s big day was taken, before Nadine Maraj and Shiraz Sharif had just over £2,300 pounds vanish into Glancy’s account. The frauds, which were carried out between March 1 and June 6, 2013, were exposed by an investigation launched after Lisa Patel tried to send Glancy an email, only for a message to bounce back saying she had left the club. Wentworth honoured the payments to make sure the weddings went ahead as planned. Glancy’s defence counsel Robert Spencer-Bernard told the judge that his client was 'genuinely remorseful' and had paid back the full amount to Wentworth. The judge had deferred Glancy’s sentencing hearing last month to give her time to prove she had spent the money on charitable causes, and to repay the cash.","Patricia Glancy, 36, conned couples out of money at Wentworth Golf Club .

"By . Chris Parsons . A defendant turned away from court for wearing shorts during this week's sweltering temperatures stunned magistrates by strolling back for his hearing dressed in a blouse and skirt. David Jeffries-Tipton, 47, was told by ushers at Cannock Magistrates Court his summer attire of shorts and a vest top were not appropriate clothing and was turned away from the building. But disgruntled Mr Jeffries-Tipton, who was due to face magistrates for a minor criminal damage charge, reappeared at court soon after in a red floral skirt and light-coloured silk blouse. Skirting the law: David Jeffries-Tipton donned a floral skirt and blouse in court after being told by ushers his shorts and vest top were not 'appropriate clothing' And after returning 30 minutes later in a full set of ladies clothes from a charity shop, court staff did not bat an eye-lid at his new ensemble and his case went ahead as normal. Mr Jeffries-Tipton had been due before magistrates on a criminal damage charge after admitting urinating on his ex-girlfriend's £48 dog basket. Speaking after the case, in which magistrates made no reference to his cross-dressing, Jeffries-Tipton, from Stafford, said he was not happy that he could not wear shorts and his vest top. He said: 'I am not allowed to wear shorts even though it’s one of the hottest summer days. 'There were loads of women walking around with vest tops on inside the court - so I thought I’d be OK. 'I had to go to a charity shop to get these clothes and I shall now be making a complaint.' 'When I returned I got a few funny looks but they couldn’t stop me from wearing it - and I was allowed into court. 'It’s ridiculous that it came to that in order for me to get my case heard. A spokesperson at Cannock Crown Court said defendants must 'dress in a manner that will respect the dignity of the court.' 'The other people there thought it was quite amusing - after they found out I wasn’t a transvestite. 'Even one of the solicitors seemed to see the funny side.' Jeffries-Tipton, from Stafford, was also charged with criminal damage to his ex-girlfriend’s flat-screen television. He had denied damaging the television set which cost £583.80 - but admitted damaging the £48 dog basket owned by his ex, Karen Griggs, by urinating on it. Jeffries-Tipton was acquitted of the damage to the TV as it could not be proved that the television had been damaged by the defendant as there had been no witnesses. Chairwoman of the bench, Mrs Leonora Wilson-Weaver said his actions were of a 'disgusting nature' and had a domestic violence nature to them. Jeffries-Tipton is to have a probation report compiled and will reappear in court on June 20. He was released on conditional bail. After the case a court spokesman said: 'People attending court are expected to dress in a manner that will respect the dignity of the court. 'Court staff may request that more appropriate clothing is worn.'","David Jeffries-Tipton, 47, took drastic action after being barred from entering Cannock Magistrates Court .

"By . Jason Groves . Lowering the voting age to 16 will be among Ed Miliband's first acts if he wins the next election, Labour will say today. Shadow . justice secretary Sadiq Khan will say that lowering the voting age is . one of the party's top priorities as it seeks to restore public trust in . politics. The Tories . have dismissed the idea as 'student politics', and accused Labour of . pandering to the trade unions, who have demanded a cut in the voting . age. Sadiq Khan will claim today that the change could play a key part in tackling 'the public's malaise towards all things political' Labour insiders believe the party will benefit from the move because the 16 and 17-year-old age group are considered more likely to vote in its favour. But Mr Khan will claim today that the change could play a key part in tackling 'the public's malaise towards all things political'. Mr Khan wants to have the legislation in place in time for the London mayoral elections in 2016, in which he is tipped as a possible Labour candidate. This would require legislation immediately after the 2015 election to give young people time to register to vote. 'I'd love it if we can get the law changed in time for the next London mayoral contest,' he will say today. Lowering the voting age to 16 will be among Ed Miliband's first acts if he wins the next election . 'Getting the public into the habit of voting is clearly a key part of any solution if we are to raise the numbers of those who participate in elections. 'We need to get people hooked on voting at an early age because the evidence shows if you vote when you first become eligible you're more likely to keep on voting for the rest of your life. 'Don't vote when you're young and you're more likely to never vote. 'Changing the law and extending those eligible to vote would mean governments in the future would be foolish to ignore their voice.' Mr Miliband publicly backed the idea of votes at 16 at last year's Labour conference, when he said: 'Let's give a voice to these young people in our democracy, let's give the vote to 16 and 17-year-olds and make them part of our democracy.' Tory Party chairman Grant Shapps accused Mr Miliband of caving in to union demands to politicise the classroom, with votes for youngsters who are still at school. Other countries where voting is permitted at 16 include Austria, Nicaragua, Brazil and Ecuador. Youngsters aged 16 and 17 will also be allowed to vote in this year's referendum on Scottish independence.","Labour insiders believe the party will benefit from the move because the 16 and 17-year-old group are considered more likely to vote in its favour .

"By . Sophie Borland . A third of GPs say patients should be charged for going to A&E, according to a poll. They want to impose a basic fee of up to £10 a time to deter the public from turning up with 'trivial' complaints. A survey of 800 family doctors found that many believe patients are going to A&E at the 'drop of the hat' because they can't be bothered to wait for an appointment. But the findings will prompt anger among members of the public who feel they have no choice but to go to casualty because they can't see their GP – especially at evenings and weekends. (File picture) A survey has found many GPs believe some patients go to A&E at the 'drop of the hat' The poll by doctors.net.uk found that 32 per cent of GPs were in favour of A&E charges. One doctor said: 'Charging even a nominal fee of about £10 for each attendance will probably cut the attendances by half.' Another argued: 'If patients had to pay a £5 charge to attend A&E – that could be refunded for appropriate attendances – they would be more inclined to take their coughs to the pharmacist where they belong.' Meanwhile, GPs have been warned that surgeries could be shut down after closing early without permission during the festive period. Hundreds of practices are suspected of shutting early on Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve despite being paid to stay open until 6.30pm. NHS officials have sent warning notices to several surgeries over concerns that patients may have ended up in overstretched A&E units after doctors went home early. NHS England – which runs the health service – rang round 238 surgeries in London on Christmas Eve between 3.30pm and 6.30pm and found 5 per cent were closed. They did not contact all 8,000 surgeries in England, but if the percentages are broadly similar, as many as 400 surgeries may have closed early. The poll by doctors.net.uk found that 32 per cent of GPs were in favour of A&E charges . Officials carried out the same exercise on New Year's Eve and are now in the process of issuing breach of contract notices to offending practices. These are written warnings telling doctors that their contracts to run practices could be terminated if they break the rules again. Commenting on the medical news website Pulse, which uncovered the story, some GPs argued that it was a 'waste of time' keeping surgeries open on Christmas and New Year's Eve as they are traditionally so quiet. Dr Peter Swinyard, a GP in Swindon, Wiltshire, who is chairman of the Family Doctor Association, wrote: 'What a complete farce. The number of calls after 3.30pm on Christmas Eve is always vanishingly small.' But NHS England officials insisted that doctors still had a duty to care for patients, warning that there was a risk people would be redirected to busy A&E and out-of-hours services. A spokesman said: 'We undertook this exercise because we wanted to ensure that patients in London had access to the primary care services that they are entitled to.' Last month Dr David Geddes, a senior GP who is head of primary care commissioning at NHS England, told family doctors not to close early on Christmas or New Year's Eve. He said closing times were 'non-negotiable' and that the period could be the sole chance some patients had to pick up vital medication.","Survey GPs believe patients go to A&E at the 'drop of the hat'

A young mother died of a rare flesh-eating disease after a GP mistook her condition for a frozen shoulder. Sarah Tinay, 32, died within days of complaining about the pain in her arm. Her GP gave her painkillers but the discomfort got worse and a few days later her father, Ken Clark, took her to Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. After a CT scan, she was diagnosed with necrotising fasciitis, a condition in which bacteria starts killing healthy tissue. If not caught quickly it leads to blood poisoning and multiple organ failure. Mrs Tinay was immediately prepared for surgery but she died on the operating table. Just before she went into theatre her father told her: ‘You will soon be back with your family.’ Mr Clark said: ‘I gave her a kiss and she smiled and I said, “Dad always knows best.” That was the last time we spoke.’ Mrs Tinay’s husband Paul, 39, who has been left to bring up the couple’s 16-month-old daughter Lauren alone, is refusing to blame the GP at Wellington House Practice in Princes Risborough who saw his wife. IT salesman Mr Tinay believes the reason his wife succumbed to the disease will remain ‘a complete mystery’. Necrotising fasciitis can be caused by common bacteria.  It normally breaks out only in people with weakened immune systems such as the frail.

Meanwhile, two men are recovering after they had to be rescued from an attempt to climb Snowdon. The pair, both 25 and from Walsall, sparked a full-scale emergency after they got caught up in a snowstorm yesterday afternoon. A Sea King helicopter from RAF Valley in Anglesey could not reach them because of cloud, so four members of the Llanberis mountain rescue team were tasked to find the pair. In a two-hour operation, the men, who were cold and exhausted, were helped back down the mountain to safety.

At the world's only mute swan sanctuary in Abbotsbury, Dorset, the animals finished enjoying last week's warm weather just in time - with the laying of the first eggs of the year. The first one was spotted on Thursday by deputy swanherd Steve Groves in a nest close to the feeding area at Abbotsbury Swannery, near Weymouth. Now there are almost 20 as the numbers of swans making nests continues to increase.

Dave Wheeler, head swanherd for more than 30 years, said: 'We didn't know what to expect because of the terrible floods - the site was submerged twice in February and a lot of things were damaged. 'Last year, the first egg was laid here on April 1 but back in 2012 the first egg was laid on March 14 - so we never can predict timings. 'The eggs are now coming thick and fast. We're not sure if we'll beat last year's total of 100 swan nests, but the first egg has been a good sign of things to come.' Despite the rush of cold weather, so many eggs could prove a good omen, claimed Mr Wheeler. 'Old Dorset legend has it that the day of the hatching of the first cygnet is the first day of summer,' he said. 'If we assume that this first swan spends another week laying eggs, then summer could be just six weeks away.'","Wintry showers led to a covering of snow in the north including County Durham, Cumbria and Northumberland .

RBS, which is still largely owned by the taxpayer having been steered . close to collapse. ‘Rather than just sighing and saying . “this isn’t ideal, but there’s not much we can do”, we need to look at . what has happened and get a grip on the issue. Surely once bitten, twice . shy,’ the source said. Asked whether the Prime Minister was . happy to see other RBS executives receive million-pound bonuses, a . Downing Street spokesman said: ‘What we are not going to be doing is . micro-managing. ‘This Government has taken action to . ensure that bonuses are responsible, they are much lower, there is a cap . on cash bonuses of £2,000 and we are reforming the whole system.’ It was ‘a matter for individuals’ whether they chose to accept any bonus they are offered, she added. But Mr Cable said Mr Hester’s decision to give up his bonus was a ‘good step to dealing with the bonus culture more generally’. The Business Secretary added: ‘I’m not . dictating… but I think he has set a good example. I think that more . generally in the banking sector we have got to see more of a sense of . perspective. ‘We have got to focus on what the bank . is for and what the performance actually means. I just want to focus . very clearly on getting proper bank lending to good British companies.’ But Right-wing Tories warned that politicians meddled in RBS’s affairs at their peril. More to come: RBS is braced for more criticism as it prepares to unveil the bonuses paid to staff in its investment banking division . Some said Mr Hester and other members . of the bank’s board could walk away having been publicly humiliated, a . huge  risk given the bank’s massive balance sheet and the danger to the . public finances if it cannot be sold back to the private sector. Mark Field, Tory MP for the Cities of . London and Westminster, warned that a ‘lynch mob mentality’ was putting . the vital financial services industry in peril. The head of the Financial Services . Authority admitted yesterday that supervision of Britain’s banks was . ‘grossly inadequate’ in the run-up to the credit crunch. Hector Sants told the Commons Treasury . committee he was ‘truly sorry’ for the impact of the banking crisis on . small shareholders and taxpayers. The former investment banker . acknowledged that he had been instrumental in persuading RBS to ask . shareholders for £1billion in 2008 as it struggled to boost its cash . reserves – a decision which led to heavy losses for shareholders when . the bank collapsed months later.

"By . Jamie Carragher . Chelsea shouldn’t be keeping pace in this title race. With three forwards who have managed just eight league goals between them, they should be watching Manchester City disappear into the distance. But Chelsea — the team I tipped for the title at the start of the season — are right in the thick of it because they have the ultimate big-game manager. Do not underestimate how influential Jose Mourinho will be as the season reaches its climax. Energised: Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho always comes alive for the big games . Title favourites: Many are expecting Man City to run away with the league in the second half of the season . Showdowns like Sunday’s with Manchester United make Mourinho tick. He comes alive in the build-up and has a way of dominating the agenda. As an opposition player, it complicates things as you find yourself thinking about him as much as the players you have to stop in the game. I said on this page earlier in the season how I felt Mourinho was ‘The Different One’ but time has proved he is, in many respects, the same as when he first arrived here nine years ago. Take what happened with Samuel Eto’o against Liverpool last month. Eto’o should have been sent off and should also have given a penalty away yet Mourinho managed to flip the post-match narrative to attack Luis Suarez’s diving and the number of former Liverpool players working in the media! Mind games: Mourinho deflected attention away from Samuel Eto's apparent trip on Luis Suarez last month . The main similarity between the Mourinho of then and now comes from his ability to deliver in the season-shaping contests. When Chelsea won back-to-back titles during his first reign, his record against Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool was almost exemplary. He knows what it takes to find a result when it matters and, over those first two campaigns, Chelsea took 29 points off their main rivals, winning nine and drawing two of the 12 games. You can see why he has won nine of the 12 major cup finals he has contested during his managerial career. Mourinho is repeating the trick. Each time Chelsea have faced a defining match in the Premier League this year, Mourinho has come up with the right solution. Some will argue his teams are not always the most attractive but they are absolutely effective. It started in his second match when he set up a team with no strikers to get a point at Old Trafford. A month later at White Hart Lane, the introduction of Juan Mata at half-time was the catalyst to turn a one-goal deficit into a 1-1 draw, even though Chelsea finished with 10 men. He then coaxed a last-gasp 2-1 home win against Manchester City in October, flooded the midfield at Arsenal to get a 0-0 draw before Christmas then played to the gallery in the 2-1 win over Liverpool, whipping up the fans and inspiring his players. That was always the thing about tackling Chelsea. You never felt like you were just facing 11 men — you felt you had to play him, too. Sir Alex Ferguson had a habit of appearing on the touchline at key moments and Mourinho is a master of that, too. He also knows how to play mind games, which is why I smiled when I read his comments about how he had ‘heard’ things were ‘not happy’ at Old Trafford. There was also a casual remark that United are ‘out of the title race’. Mourinho used to say things like that all the time about Liverpool. I remember him complaining about Chelsea not getting a penalty in the first leg of the Champions League semi-final in 2007 when Alvaro Arbeloa accidentally handled outside the area. Jose kept saying how he hoped Chelsea ‘wouldn’t be crying about another big  decision’ in the return. He was relentless, so the only way to take him on was with humour. Before the second leg, I said he was the funniest thing to come out of London since Del Boy and Rodney. Gearing up: Mourinho puts his players through their paces at Chelsea's Cobham training ground on Friday . We had Chelsea’s number then — we beat them in three semi-finals in three years — and the wins were extra special as he would have tried everything to grind you down. When he left in 2007, we felt even more confident about beating them, even though they were  essentially still his team. Maybe Mourinho had a point to prove when he came back this  summer after the two Manchester clubs looked elsewhere for new  managers. But he is working like a man on a mission and whatever he is doing, it is working. He has hardly made any changes to a squad that in the past two seasons finished 25 points then 14 points off the title winners, yet here they are bang in contention, just two points off the lead and  getting stronger. Of course, they have some top performers. Joe Cole told me 18 months ago that Eden Hazard would blossom into a star and he has taken his game up a level after a slow start to the season. Star in the making: Eden Hazard's game has come on since Mourinho took over at Stamford Bridge . If he maintains this vein of form, he could challenge Suarez when the individual honours are handed out later on. Aside from inspiring Hazard, his handling of Mata — not selecting a crowd favourite — has been proved correct by results and the impact of Oscar and Willian. The biggest impact of all, however, has come from Mourinho. Should Chelsea win tomorrow, Mourinho will have his 100th  Premier League victory. It would be symbolic, as his first came against United in 2004. It would be a record, too, as it would only have taken 141 matches to get there. For context, Ferguson needed 162; Arsene Wenger took 179 matches. But, above all, it would also be ominous for Chelsea’s rivals. City might be exciting with all their goals but they can’t, for one moment, be considered title certainties. Not when Mourinho’s influence remains stronger than ever. Pointing the finger: Mourinho shouts at Jamie Carragher during the 2005 League Cup final . Kick politics out of football . So, Cristiano Ronaldo won the Ballon d’Or but what we really saw at the glittering award ceremony in Zurich was the politics of the voting system laid bare. Don’t think what happened is something new. In fact, I’d go as far as to say it happens at every club in the country when the PFA forms are handed out. Put it this way: if Liverpool had someone . in the running for the Player of the Year award, or the Young Player of . the Year award, the ‘rule’ in the dressing room would be: Do not vote . for any of their rivals. Proud moment: Real Madrid frontman Cristiano Ronaldo poses with the Ballon d'Or on Monday night . Here is an example: Luis Suarez has an outstanding chance of winning the PFA award this season. Seeing as you can’t pick anyone from your own club, I wouldn’t expect any Liverpool player to choose Sergio Aguero, Eden Hazard or Aaron Ramsey as their selection. I’m not saying Ronaldo didn’t deserve to win the Ballon d’Or for the second time, as he had an astonishing year and his consistency and endurance have been remarkable, but there should be a way of making the award even more significant. Votes for the Ballon d’Or should be taken away from national coaches and captains and it should be left exclusively to journalists, as it used to be. Leading contenders: But Aguero (left) and Suarez (right) will be hindered by the voting process . Liverpool’s game with Aston Villa this evening carries particular significance for me, as it is 17 years to the day since I marked my first start in a Red shirt with a goal in front of The Kop. It was a day I will never forget — we won 3-0 — and I’m sure the players I’ve picked out here would say the same. 1 Alan Shearer: One of the great strikers of the modern era served notice of what was to come when, on his full debut in April 1988 (below), he scored three for Southampton against Arsenal in a 4-2 win. Aged 17, he became the youngest player, at that time, to score a hat-trick in the top flight. 2 Wayne Rooney: We all knew Wayne would be a success when he went to Manchester United but nobody expected the startling impact he made in his first game in September 2004. He scored a hat-trick at Old Trafford in the 6-2 Champions League victory against Fenerbahce (below). 3 Fabrizio Ravanelli: I remember the day Ravanelli introduced himself to English football in August 1996. I made the bench for the first time at the Riverside, it was a glorious day and a superb 3-3 draw. I’ll never forget the celebration — pulling his shirt over his head — after each of his three Middlesbrough goals. 4 Jurgen Klinsmann: There was a big buzz around the opening day in August 1994 and much of it was because Klinsmann had joined Tottenham. He didn’t disappoint at Sheffield Wednesday, scoring a header, celebrating with a dive (below) to mock his critics and inspiring a 4-3 win at Hillsborough. 5 Tony Cottee: Evertonians couldn’t wait to get a glimpse of Cottee after he arrived at Goodison Park for a British record £2.2million from West Ham in August 1988. That month he made a brilliant first impression, scoring three goals in a 4-0 win over Newcastle (below).","Man City should be well ahead of Chelsea when you compare strikeforces .

"By . James Chapman . The £1 coin is to be scrapped in favour of a 12-sided replacement modelled on the old threepenny bit. George Osborne took a two-coloured prototype to  Buckingham Palace last night to show to the Queen. The Chancellor will use today’s Budget to announce that the switchover will start in 2017. Scroll down for video . Prototype: The new £1 coin will be introduced from 2017, George Osborne announced today . Ministers say urgent action is needed to combat the number of counterfeits in circulation. Designers claim the new coin will be the hardest to copy in the world. In a nod to Britain’s heritage, it is the same shape as the 12-sided threepenny or ‘thrupenny’ bit, which was in circulation from 1937 until decimalisation in 1971. The coin – in the same gold and silver colours as the euro – will force firms and councils to make expensive changes to parking meters, vending machines and shopping trolleys. In a report published today, the Royal Mint estimates that an astonishing 45million £1 coins – 3 per cent of the total – are fake. The figure is as high as 6 per cent in some parts of the UK and two million counterfeits are removed from circulation every year. The £1 coin has been in use since 1983 – much longer than the normal life cycle for legal tender of its value – and 1.5billion were in circulation as of March 2013. The outdated technology used to make the coin leaves it vulnerable to sophisticated counterfeiters. Its replacement will be roughly the same size with security features including bi-metallic construction, the 12-sided design and the use of iSIS – integrated Secure Identification System. This means an additive is built into coins which can be authenticated by high-speed scanners. The technology will allow vending machines to spot fakes much more easily. Mr Osborne tweeted that he has a plan for a 'resilient economy', and a picture of a new 12-sided pound coin which was last night approved by the Queen . As with all British coins, the . Queen’s image will be on the obverse – ‘heads’ side. The Treasury will . hold a competition to decide the design for the reverse, or ‘tails’ side. ‘The time is right to retire the current £1 coin and replace it with the most secure coin in the world,’ said a Treasury source. ‘With . advances in technology making high value coins like the £1 ever more . vulnerable to counterfeiters, it’s vital that we keep several paces . ahead of the criminals to maintain the integrity of our currency. ‘We . are particularly pleased the coin will take a giant leap into the . future, using cutting edge British technology while at the same time . paying a fitting tribute to the past in the 12-sided design of the . iconic threepenny bit.’ Out with the old: The present £1 coin, left, will be replaced to allay concerns about counterfeiting. Its replacement will be a reworking of the old-fashioned threepenny bit, which last circulated in 1971 . The threepenny bit was popular in the Second World War because its distinctive size and shape made it easy to recognise during the blackout. Adam Lawrence, chief executive of the Royal Mint, said: ‘We’re extremely proud that the proposal includes the Royal Mint’s iSIS technology, offering greater currency security at a lower cost. Announcement: George Osborne will include details of the new coin in his Budget speech today . It will enable coin authentication throughout the cash cycle, ensuring currency credibility.’ A Bank of England spokesman said: ‘The Bank welcomes today’s news from the Treasury as another step forward in our collective efforts to maintain public confidence in the currency. Coins are the responsibility of the Royal Mint and together with the Bank’s decision to produce polymer banknotes, this change will enhance the security and integrity of the currency.’ John Sheridan, counterfeit currency expert at the National Crime Agency, said: ‘The issuing of a new coin with enhanced security features will make it more difficult for criminals to copy as well as presenting increased opportunities for law enforcement to investigate and disrupt the producers and distributors of counterfeit currency.’ The bill to convert parking meters, vending machines and phone boxes to take the new coin may be as high as £100million. Some of the cost will be carried by councils, potentially diverting cash from other work, such as filling pot holes. Town halls complained bitterly when new thicker 5p and 10p coins were introduced in 2012. They said the change would cost them £5.5million. The new burden will mainly fall on firms operating 400,000 machines selling everything from train tickets to hot drinks and snacks. Supermarket trolleys, payphones and fruit machines will also have to be upgraded. Kelvin Reynolds, of the British Parking Association, said members had expressed concerns about a rise in counterfeits and the inconvenience this caused motorists whose coins are rejected by payment machines . ‘We look forward to working closely with the Royal Mint during the public consultation on the introduction of this new coin with its improved security features,’ he added. A spokesman for the Automatic Vending Association said it was vital the change was undertaken at the lowest possible cost to industry. Helen Dickinson, of the British Retail Consortium, said: ‘It is important for industry that any potential change is effectively planned and managed in order to minimise hardware costs for business. ‘The BRC will engage with both the Government and the Royal Mint to support a smooth transition.’","George Osborne will announce the new coin in his Budget speech today .

He said: 'That is going to be a huge challenge for the team to enable the technology to work within such a small confined area.' Samsung is expected to unveil its Galaxy Gear smartwatch in Berlin today, but doom-saying analysts are already predicting poor sales and a lack of enthusiasm for the technology. The Korean company could be the first major smartphone manufacturer to release a device that resembles a smartphone worn on the wrist, although other, similar devices such as the Pebble and Androidly are already on sale.

"By . Neil Ashton . When Steven Gerrard was in a really bad mood he would go home to his wife Alex and bite her head off. Then it would be the turn of the kids - Lilly-Ella, Lexie and Lourdes - to hear their dad grumbling about his career-threatening groin injury in 2010. On Tuesday, Gerrard spoke of being a better man after private sessions with psychiatrist Dr Steve Peters. Changed: England's Steven Gerrard praised the appointment of psychiatrist Dr Steve Peters to the team staff . ‘I had one-on-one meetings with him,’ revealed Gerrard ahead of Wednesday night’s clash with Denmark at Wembley. ‘I understand the different parts of the brain, how they work, when they function and why you think certain things, why you bite your children’s heads off from time to time, blame Alex for everything - blah, blah, blah.’ There will be scepticism  about Peters’ appointment for the World Cup, but this is a smart move. Endorsement: Gerrard had one-on-one meetings with Peters when going through a groin injury . Desperate: Luke Shaw is keen to make an impression on Roy Hodgson . Neat touch: Wayne Rooney juggles the ball during the training session at Enfield on Monday . Gerrard was brave enough to confront . his demons at a time when he wondered whether he would ever play for . Liverpool or England again. ‘I . had a groin avulsion and it’s a career-threatening injury,’ he said. ‘I’d seen three or four  surgeons and they weren’t really convincing me . that I could play again so I turned to him. 'He helps you with . positivity, the power of thought and staying upbeat, that sort of . stuff.  Without being a drama queen it was a very important stage in my . career. ‘I think it was one . of the  physios at Liverpool who suggested I might need a bit of help . from a psychologist so I said, “Who’s the best?” ‘I was told he was the best.’ Heads up: Jack Wilshere keeps his eye on the ball and will hope to get some game time against Denmark . Something old, something new: It's routine for Wayne Rooney but Luke Shaw is preparing for his England debut . Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge praised Dr Peters in an interview last October as he hit top form for his club. 'Steve had helped a lot in terms of mindset,' he told the Liverpool Echo. 'He's all about self-belief: don't go out there with the mentality of trying to do something, just let it happen.' Dr Peters made Sturridge give himself a mark out of 10 for his Liverpool performances so far. 'Steve told me to say high but I've never been one to be comfortable. I'm uncomfortable getting comfortable. I . think, for my capacity as a footballer, I'd sat a seven out of 10. Probably even six - I'm being kind to myself saying a seven. I can do a . lot better than I'm doing now.' Peters, . who has worked with Sir Chris Hoy and Victoria Pendleton, was nicknamed . ‘head coach’ when he worked with British Cycling and his book Taming . the Chimp was referred to several times by Gerrard. ‘He just simplifies what’s going on,’ added England’s captain. ‘If you read the book you’ll understand an awful lot more.’ Peters . is employed by Liverpool and has been seconded by the national team for . the World Cup. He will join them before they head to Miami to begin . their tournament preparations at the end of May.

WHO IS DR STEVE PETERS?A consultant psychiatrist and university lecturer who works with elite sports teams and senior management for corporate industries.WHO HAS HE HELPED?Peters's clients include Team GB cyclists such as Sir Bradley Wiggins and Sir Chris Hoy, Ronnie O’Sullivan, Liverpool and England’s 2007 Rugby World Cup squad.WHAT ARE HIS METHODS?Peters works to a principle called ‘The Chimp Paradox’, which says the brain is split into three parts: the rational ‘human’ section, the illogical ‘chimp’ section and a computer for storing information. The way athletes control their ‘chimp’ dictates how well they perform. Put simply, athletes need to control their surges of emotion. HOW DOES IT WORK IN PRACTICE?Peters gets athletes to write down all the problems in their lives leading up to a big competition. For each problem they then have to provide a logical solution to help them deal with it. Peters also warns athletes against setting goals that are beyond their control. For example, footballers should not set a goal of becoming the best footballer in the world because they have no control over what other players will achieve. However, he will tell them to try and be the best they can possibly be and then devise a plan from there.

"By . Will Stewart . and Ryan Kisiel . Russian police have launched a criminal investigation after two British anglers were killed by a helicopter’s rotor blades during a luxury salmon fishing tour north of the Arctic Circle. Retired City lawyer Rupert Beaumont and fine-art dealer Mark Robertson, both 69, died alongside their Russian guide and interpreter, Alexander Tushnikov, 53. Last night the helicopter pilot was being questioned by detectives amid claims he initially misled police about the events surrounding the crash. The probe is understood to be looking into whether human error was to blame for the tragedy, rather than initial suggestions of adverse weather conditions. Wreckage: Debris litters the site where this helicopter crashed, killing two British tourists and their guide . Investigation: The rotor blades are clearly missing from the Eurocopter EC-120 which crashed while taking two Britons and a guide on a luxury fishing trip to a remote part of Russia . Pictures show the Eurocopter E120B . lurched to one side – lending support to the theory that wet ground made . the helicopter slip, striking the men below. The British pair were on what has . been described as the ‘ultimate’ salmon fishing trip in the Kola . peninsula, 90 miles from the Russian Arctic port city of Murmansk. The . tours cost up to £4,000 a week. They had just been dropped off at an . angling lodge on Sunday morning, near the Rynda river, when their . chartered helicopter banked suddenly while trying to take off. The . blades hit the three men, killing them instantly. Remote: Rescuers survey the scene in the isolated Murmansk region of Russia when two British salmon fishermen and their guide were killed by the spinning rotor blades . Impact: The helicopter flipped moments after dropping off Mark Robertson and Rupert Beaumont and their guide for a fishing trip, initial reports suggest . Emergency: The pilot of the stricken helicopter managed to escape the wreckage with only minor injuries . The Russian authorities opened a . criminal case by questioning Shabalin over an alleged violation of air . safety rules leading to the death of two or more people, which carries a . penalty of between four and ten years in jail. Pilot Alexander Shabalin alerted the emergency services with a distress call, but is now said to be ‘traumatised’. Tribute: Rupert Beaumont, pictured, was described as a devoted family man who was deeply admired within the legal profession . Both Britons were enthusiastic fishermen and lived close to each other in Hook, Hampshire. Mr Beaumont was a senior partner at . London law firm Slaughter and May, and a director of the exclusive New . Zealand Golf Club near West Byfleet, Surrey. A keen golfer and bridge player, who . retired at 57, the father of two was described as ‘instrumental’ in the . deal to sell the collapsed Barings Bank in 1995 following the Nick . Leeson rogue trader scandal. His wife Susie was yesterday . travelling back from a holiday, where she was understood to be visiting . their daughter Juliet in Australia. Slaughter and May senior partner Chris Saul described Mr Beaumont as a ‘great teacher’ who loved life. He said: ‘This is the most tragic news.

Tragedy: The helicopter which is thought to have killed the three men was a Eurocopter 120B (stock image, this helicopter was not involved in the crash) BY MAIL FOREIGN SERVICE . The Kola peninsula became the ‘ultimate destination’ for luxury fishing tours after the Cold War.But those who spend £4,000 a head to fish in some of the most well-stocked waters in the world, are taking a calculated risk. The area is accessible for only five months of the year, the rivers are frozen for up to four months and in December the temperature plunges to an average minimum temperature of -39C. All travel in Russia can be hazardous, with the country’s road death rate of 19.5 per 100,000 only just below many African countries. But having to charter a helicopter into the best fishing areas only adds to the danger. Although the three men who died on Sunday were travelling in a modern Eurocopters, it is not uncommon for extreme tourists in Russia to be carried in ancient Army helicopters that are veterans from the Afghanistan wars. Angling enthusiast David Profumo, son of disgraced politician John Profumo, was lucky to survive a crash in an MI-2 helicopter in the Kola peninsula in 2001. He was on a fishing expedition for The Field magazine and was pulled from the wreckage by the pilot, leaving him with two broken ribs. It took ten hours for the group to be rescued. In such a vast country, many parts of which offer limited medical care, people caught up in trouble have to travel hundreds of miles for often substandard help. When television presenter and keen angler Chris Tarrant visited the Kola peninsula in 2000, he said he was threatened by a drunk fishing inspector with a loaded revolver. And although the fish are plentiful, it is not advisable to eat them. As the former home of the Soviet submarine fleet, the Kola peninsula is littered with facilities housing more than 100 tons of nuclear waste – the largest concentration in the world.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Olympic star hockey player TJ Oshie and his fiancee Lauren Cosgrove became first time parents after Cosgrove gave birth to baby girl Lyla Grace on Monday. St Louis Blues player Oshie was one of the stars of the Sochi Olympics, helping nab the men's hockey team a decent fourth-place in the tournament. But Cosgrove had to cheer on her 'heartthrob' fiancee from back home in Missouri, since she was too pregnant to fly to Russia. Thankfully, the excitement of the Olympic . hockey tournament didn't send Cosgrove into a premature labor and she . gave birth as scheduled at 9:57am on St Patrick's Day with Oshie by her . side. Welcome to the world! Hockey star TJ Oshie (right) and fiancee Lauren Cosgrove became first-time parents on Monday after giving birth to baby girl Lyla Grace . Daddy's little star: Oshie took off Monday night's game against Winnepeg so he could spend some quality time with his new daughter . Stayed at home: Cosgrove wasn't allowed to accompany her man to the Olympics because she was too pregnant . After labor, Cosgrove posted a picture of her new family on Twitter, writing: '1st day as parents! We love our little Lyla Grace.' The new dad took off work that night, as the Blues faced off against Winnepeg. But he was back on the ice two days later to play the Chicago Blackhawks. Cosgrove was still in the hospital when Oshie left for Chicago, and complained on Twitter that there wasn't ESPN to watch the game on. Back to work: Unfortunately his paternity leave was cut short when he had to leave Cosgrove in the hospital two days later to play the Chicago Blackhawks . That may have been in a blessing in disguise though, as St Louis lost out to Chicago 0-4. As her soon-to-be-husband became a Sochi sensation, Cosgrove told reporters at home the tale of their romance. 'He's been a hearthrob for a while, here in St. Louis at least,' Cosgrove told KSDK. The longtime couple met in North Dakota and Cosgrove moved to St Louis shortly after he joined the Blues. He proposed to her on their 3-year anniversary, just before he left for Sochi, but a then 8-months pregnant Cosgrove had to stay home. Who's luckier? Stunning blonde Lauren Cosgrove (left) is the fiancee of overnight USA hockey hero TJ Oshie (right) Hero: Despite barely making the team, TJ Oshie became a star of the Olympics after helping the men's hockey team advance past Russia in the tournament . 'I might go into labor,' Cosgrove joked about watching the nail-biting Olympic matches. Oshie emerged as one of the real stars of the games after helping the U.S.propel past Russia in the tournament - a remarkable feat considering he barely made the team. He was among the final selections for the U.S. roster and while he has never had a 20-goal NHL season, Oshie leads the Olympic team's American-born players with seven shootout goals this year. Oshie scored four times in the shootout and put the winner between the Russian goalie's legs in the eighth round, leading the United States past Russia 3-2 in the thrilling revival of the classic Olympic hockey rivalry stretching back to the USA's 1980 Miracle on Ice win. So, it may have been his small fish attitude less than his underdog status that made Oshie's game winning shoot out goal so unexpected. Just ask Cosgrove what he said when he called her after the game. 'I hope this all blows over pretty quick,' Cosgrove recalls Oshie saying about the media frenzy currently encircling him. 'This isn't really him,' she said. 'He's so low key.' All American: The beaming couple were engaged on their three-year anniversary just before Oshie left for Sochi . America's golden couple: The soon-to-be famous hockey bride met up-and-coming Oshie while they visited friends in North Dakota three years ago . History in the making: USA forward T.J.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Many security experts have already voiced concerns that fingerprint scanners, such as the one in Apple's new iPhone 5S, are flawed and not as secure as their makers claim. Now one leading security researcher has taken this a step further suggesting the technology could actually lead to an increase in crime, with the robberies potentially becoming more brutal. Marc Rogers from San Francisco-based firm Lookout said: 'Fingerprints are not fool-proof and can be duplicated and as the usage of this technology increases, we can expect that duplication technology will improve as well. 'Thieves in some regions have worked out that you can force a victim to unlock a secured device,' and in extreme cases this brutality could lead to fingers being cut off. Scroll down for video . Apple said the Touch ID fingerprint sensor is designed to provide 'accurate readings from any angle, so the motion to unlock your device ought to be as automatic as it is now' The Touch ID sensor is built into the . premium phone's 'home' button and can be used to unlock the phone, as . well as pay for shopping and apps automatically. Speaking at the launch event in Cupertino, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller reassured users that Touch ID is secure by explaining that 'all fingerprint information is encrypted and stored securely inside the device's chip' adding the prints are not stored on an Apple server, or backed up to iCloud. Yet Rogers claims it shouldn't be used on its own. 'Unlocking . a device with a fingerprint, if done right, can be much more convenient . than entering a pin code multiple times a day.' 'So many users fail to enable [PINs] altogether and in this case, fingerprint scanning is better than nothing at all, but it provides little added security over a four-digit code. 'And because fingerprints can be lifted and duplicated, they should not be used as the sole credential in a high security scenario unless enhanced through the use of a PIN code or other secondary factor of authentication.' Apple announced that its iPhone 5S, pictured, has a fingerprint scanner built into the 'home' button. Apple has stated that the Touch ID sensor is 'capacitive' which means that it will only work with live fingers that have a recognisable pulse . Touch ID uses a small touch sensor encased around the home button that scans the layers of skin on a finger. Users can 'train' their iPhone to . read and learn their unique fingerprint and when they touch the home . button, the phone is unlocked. Touch ID can also be replace an App Store password when buying music, apps or books. It uses a 'laser cut sapphire . crystal' to take a high-resolution image scan before the Touch ID software in iOS 7 . detemines whether the print belongs to the owner or not. All fingerprint information is . encrypted and stored securely inside the device's chip. The prints are not stored on an Apple server, or backed up to iCloud. Apple has also stated that the Touch ID sensor is 'capacitive' which means that it will only work with live fingers that have a recognisable pulse. Paul Ducklin from Sophos Security agreed: 'Fingerprints are not secret: we leave copies of them wherever we go. Once someone devious has got hold of a copy, sensors can be fooled.' He continues that, unlike passwords, if fingerprint information is stolen it can't be changed 'short of getting medieval on your hands with acid, sandpaper or some other hardened-gangster technique.' Fingerprint authentication has become common in high-end laptops from companies such as Dell, Lenovo and Toshiba. Motorola also added a fingerprint scanner to its Atrix handset. Apple unveiled the fingerprint . scanner on its iPhone 5S on Tuesday with bold claims about its high . levels of encryption and security. The . firm even suggested that its Touch ID system could revolutionise . smartphone security and replace the traditional, everyday password. Apple's shares fell more than 5 per cent on Wednesday, following the launch of its new iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C. The share price ended at a . one-month low of $467.24 at midday after at least three brokerages . downgraded the stock. It is . thought that investors were put off by the price of the handsets, . especially the so-called 'cheap' iPhone 5C which starts at £469, . claiming they weren't low enough for Apple to attract new customers, . especially in emerging markets such as China. Analysts predicted that Apple would . be looking to boost sales in emerging markets, such as China, and this . was bolstered by the fact Apple held a mirror event in Beijing, and . announced the iPhone 5S will also be made available in China at the same . time as other countries for the first time ever. Rivals including Samsung and Huawei do well in emerging economies because their handsets are cheaper to produce, so cost less. Around a third of the world's handsets . are sold in China to half a billion people, yet only 12 per cent of . these phones are made by Apple. Korean . rivals Samsung is the leading smartphone manufacturer in the region, pictured right, . with Chinese brands including Huawei and Lenovo also popular. Apple . is still a popular choice in China, but predominantly with the Chinese . elite, and Carl Howe, vice president of Yankee Group's Consumer Research . group told ABC News: 'Rumor has [Apple] that they make more money in . any of the five stores in China than they do in the Fifth Avenue store . in New York.' Apple phones . in China cost around the same amount as the average person's monthly . salary in urban areas, or three months wages for a bus driver, for . example. The 5S is due . to sell in China for 5,288 yuan (£547) and the 5C for 4,488 yuan (£464) and the handsets, which will be available from 20 September, will be . launched in China at the same time as other major territories for the . first time ever. Howe continued that . although China is Apple's second largest market, there is a large . percentage of the population that it is not able to attract. The phrase 'iPhone 5S' was the most . popular search term on Sina Weibo, China's most widely used social . network, on Wednesday, while 'iPhone 5C' didn't appear on the top . searches list. Users . questioned why anyone willing to fork out well over 4,000 yuan for a . smartphone would not just pay a bit more for the premium 5S model. Apple's . share of the China smartphone market slipped to five per cent in the . second quarter, according to research firm Canalys, behind not just . Samsung but also Lenovo, ZTE, Huawei and Xiaomi Technology. 'Even . though Apple has a lower end iPhone now, its price is still considered . mid-end in China and not low-end,' said Sandy Shen, a Shanghai-based . analyst for Gartner. Around . half of China's smartphone shipments are in the 700-1,500 yuan range, . said Shen, but competing on those prices isn't an attractive prospect . for Apple. 'Considering . Apple's old rival Samsung and domestic players such as Huawei, Lenovo . and Coolpad all have phones in that category, Apple will still lose out . in market share in these key segments,' she said.","Apple's iPhone 5S has a fingerprint scanner built into the 'home' button .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Former Pope Benedict has denied speculation he was forced to stand down in a letter, calling the claims 'absurd' Retired Pope Benedict XVI has denied speculation that he was pressured to resign, saying the decision was made by him and him alone. In a letter to La Stampa newspaper Benedict called speculation he had been forced from his post 'absurd' ahead of the first anniversary of the resignation on Friday. The Pope Emeritus has also fended off allegations that he is still active within the church, leading a faction of the Curia who are unhappy with Pope Francis's sweeping new reforms. Benedict announced his decision to resign on Feb. 11, 2013 and formally stepped down on Feb. 28, becoming the first pope in 600 years to do so. Two weeks later, Francis was elected the first non-European pope in 1,300 years. Benedict said at the time that he was stepping down because he no longer had the physical and spiritual strength to run the 1.2 billion member Church and that his decision had been taken in full freedom. At the time he promised to live a cloistered life ‘hidden from the world’ and has not spoken in public since. However, . some Vatican watchers claim that his resignation was not 'valid' a . situation and that Benedict continues to lead as a ‘shadow’ Pope. Benedict . has kept his Papal name, lives in the Vatican and continues to wear . pontifical white, though he says this is because there were 'no other . clothes available' when he stood down. Earlier this month Italian newspaper Libero ran a long story reviving speculation that Benedict may have been forced to resign because of scandals in the Vatican. In 2012, Benedict's butler was arrested for leaking sensitive documents alleging corruption among Vatican prelates and irregularities in Vatican finances. The Pope Emeritus has also denied speculation he is still governing as a 'shadow' leader despite still living in the Vatican, using his papal name and wearing white . Italian media at the time reported that a faction of prelates who wanted to discredit Benedict and pressure him to resign was behind the leaks. The Vatican has always denied this. Libero also suggested that Benedict chose to continue to wear white because he still felt like he was a pope. Benedict, who lives in near-total isolation inside a former convent on the Vatican grounds, was also asked about this and responded: . In an interview earlier this month, Benedict's personal secretary, Archbishop Georg Ganswein, said the former pope saw his main function now as helping the Church and his successor through prayer. Benedict has responded to a few letters in the past year and has appeared in public only a handful of times. The latest was last Saturday when he attended a ceremony in St Peter's Basilica when Pope Francis created new cardinals. In his letter he wrote: 'There is absolutely no doubt regarding the validity of my resignation from the Petrine ministry. 'The only condition for the validity of my resignation is the complete freedom of my decision. Speculations regarding its validity are simply absurd.' Pope Francis was elected as the first non-European Pope in 1,300 years following Benedict's resignation . On Saturday there were visibly shocked faces when Benedict left his monastic home to attend a ceremony creating nineteen new cardinals. 'As the anniversary of his resignation approaches, some have suggested that Benedict XVI’s resignation may have lacked validity and that he is therefore still playing an active and institutional role beside the reigning Pope,' veteran Vatican journalist Andrea Tornielli explained. The Pope Emeritus also sought to justify his continued use of his Papal name and clothing, writing in the letter to newspaper La Stampa: 'I continue to wear the white cassock and kept the name Benedict for purely practical reasons. 'At the moment of my resignation there were no other clothes available. In any case, I wear the white cassock in a visibly different way to how the Pope wears it. This is another case of completely unfounded speculations being made.' Benedict XVI caused shockwaves around the globe when he announced his plan to step down on 11 February 2013, telling cardinals: 'I have come to the certainty that my strengths, due to an advanced age, are no longer suited to an adequate exercise of the Petrine ministry.' It took effect on 28 February when the cardinals met to begin the process of electing his successor, Francis.","Friday marks the first anniversary of former Pope Benedict's resignation .

A chaotic video shows Oleksandr Panteleymonov, who led the Ukrainian state TV company, being shouted at and beaten over the head until he gives into the attackers' demands and writes the letter.

The MP, who is on the new parliamentary committee on freedom of speech, said Mr Panteleymonov had ‘served Putin and Russian propaganda… at a time when Ukrainians were dying on the streets’. But Ukrainian interior minister Arsen Avakov said: ‘I am ready to organise all the required investigative efforts as soon as instructed by the general prosecutor.’ Presidential candidate and former boxer Vitali Klitschko told the politicians to immediately resign.

Cutting an uncanny resemblance to the novelty features used in arts and crafts, their playful appearance attracts quite a crowd of tourists. Native to Africa and Asia, dusky langur monkeys are affectionately branded 'spectacled leaf monkeys'. Googly: These dusky langur monkeys in Kaeng Krachan National Park have eyes like stick-on googly eyes . Thanks to the striking similarity, they have merited the nickname 'spectacled leafy monkey' in Thailand . These charming images were taken in Kaeng Krachan National Park, Phetchaburi province, Thailand, by amateur photographer Michael Edward. Mr Edward, 29, captured the cheeky dusky langur monkeys as they played together in the trees during a three-week wildlife photography tour across Thailand. The Egypt-born IT administrator said: 'I spotted these monkeys while I was enjoying a three-week-long wildlife photography tour in Thailand. 'I stayed a couple of hours with this group of monkeys - I saw the first one and stayed with it for a while before it led me to the mother and young baby. Their playful appearance make them look like muppets or cartoons, attracting swarms of tourists . Young dusky langurs are born a dazzingly bright orange but turn black or brown within weeks . Once they warmed to photographer Michael Edwards, 29, they swung around gleefully posing . 'After a couple of minutes of me being around them, they started to trust me which is how I was able to capture such good photographs of them at such close range.' Baby dusky langurs are born with bright orange fur which changes to the characteristic black coat once they reach around three months old. Michael said: 'I love to photograph animals, they are my favourite things to take photos of. Worryingly, the unusual-looking species are near-threatened, experts warn due to habitat loss . Their population has dropped by more than 30 per cent in 30 years and is set to decrease yet further . 'I have always loved animals - when I was growing up in Egypt we lived in a big house with exotic animals, such as Siamese cats, dogs, snakes, turtles and birds. 'I prefer to take photos of animals in their natural habitats, living freely in the wild. 'I love nature and don't like to see animals locked up in cages. You can capture the best moments by watching animals running free in the wild.' But these little ones in Phetchaburi province, Thailand, are happily roaming freely . This funny-looking species are currently classed as 'near threatened' after the number of these monkeys has dropped by more than 30 percent over the last 30 years. The main threats include habitat loss caused by farming and human settlements - in Malaysia there are also a significant number of deaths on the roads.

"By . Mia De Graaf . Muslim separatists from far-west China have been blamed for the brutal murder of 29 people in a frenzied knife attacked that left 143 others critically wounded. The killers launched the horrific slaughter at Kunming railway station in Yunnan province at around 9pm local time on Saturday. It is believed that more than 10 people . took part in the attack. Four were shot by armed police, . one was taken alive, and the rest are still being hunted. Scroll down for video . Today armed police patrolled the streets as members of the Uighur community were questioned . Panic: Police are urgently questioning all Uighur Muslims in Kunming after the attack that left 143 injured . CCTV shows there to have been 10 masked attackers randomly knifing bystanders in Kunming station . Their identities have not been confirmed, but evidence at the . scene showed that it was carried out by Uighir Muslims, native to far-west Xinjiang, 900 miles away, local media claim. Since President Xi Jinping was elected in 2009, Xinjiang has been simmering rebellion against Chinese rule by some members of . the Uighur population. In a desperate bid to make sense of the attack, police rounded up every member of Kunming's small Uighur community - a few dozen people - for questioning. 'How do we know them?' said a Uighur man who gave only his first name, . Akpar. 'We could not tell if the assailants were Uighurs as they were . all dressed in black. We did not like the attack either.' Most . attacks blamed on Uighur separatists take place in Xinjiang, where . clashes between Uighurs and police or the Han . majority are frequent. But Saturday's assault happened more than 900 miles to the southeast in Yunnan, which has no recent history of unrest. Residents, mainly of the Han ethnic majority, have called for the Uighur minority to be driven out of Yunnan . Lighting candles for the 29 dead, Kunming residents said they were scared to go out at night . If correct, it would be the deadliest violence . attributed to Uighur-Han conflicts since the 2009 riots in Xinjiang . capital Urumqi, when Uighurs stormed the streets randomly slaying women . and children. Han mobs responded, and nearly 200 people died. One Kunming resident, Jiang Hua, said the attack has made people scared to go out at night and Uighurs should be banished. 'I . think we should chase off the Uighurs and let them be independent,' Jiang said. 'And local authorities should be held accountable for . providing public safety.' However, one man paying tribute, restaurant worker Xie Yulong, expressed sympathy . toward ethnic Uighurs. He said . the attackers were 'worse than animals', but added that the Uighur region has come under severe . security crackdowns in recent months under the government of President . Xi Jinping. 'It's the . pressure,' Xie said. 'Beijing has put too much pressure on them since Xi . Jinping took over. They are under so much pressure they do not want to . live, and they did that.' Police chief and head of the government's central commission for political affairs Meng Jianzhu visited the wounded on Sunday and was given an update by Kunming officers on their investigation . Crackdown: He said the terrorists will be 'severely punished' to prevent similar cases in the future . Distressing photos circulating online showed bodies, pools of blood and abandoned luggage scattered across the terminal floor in the wake of what authorities termed an 'organised, premeditated, violent terrorist attack'. According to CCTV, the Chinese state broadcaster, at least two of the attackers were female. One was killed by police and the other was the woman who was captured. She has been taken to hospital for treatment. 'All-out efforts should be made to treat the injured people, . severely punish terrorists according to the law, and prevent the . occurrence of similar cases,' said China's chief police official, Meng Jianzhu, who unusually travelled on a Sunday to visit the scene - an . indication of how seriously authorities viewed the attack. Yesterday, residents flooded the province's hospitals to donate blood for the wounded. Others took to the streets with candles, calling on the authorities to clamp down on the Uighur community.","Authorities claim Muslim Uighur community of Xinjiang responsible .

"By . Richard Spillett . Dramatic new CCTV footage shows the moment a gang of armed robbers attempted to smash their way into a jewellery store in London's West End. Six raiders arrived outside Watches and Jewellery of Bond Street on mopeds on Monday and launched a violent attempt to get into the store. They tried to smash their way in using an axe and a sledgehammer, before resorting to trying to ram the door with one of their mopeds. Scroll down for video . The gang rolls up the pavement on New Bond Street, with one of the members disembarking and brandishing an axe, ready to hit the store's doors. One of the raiders (centre) appears to be pointing a handgun . Footage recorded by the store's CCTV camera has now been released by police, showing the force used by the gang and the speed of their botched raid. The group arrived shortly after 11am and disappeared after less than one minute when they realised their plans were doomed to fail. In the intervening 50 seconds, they unleashed a shocking attack on the store, riding up and down the pavement on their bikes and taking it in turns to smash the front of the shop. One of the gang sprayed passers-by who got too close with the noxious liquid, eventually injuring a guard. When they realise they cannot get into the store as the staff have shut the stores security gates, they scramble around the opening to the store, warding off passers-by . The attempted criminals begin to make their escape, nearly knocking over several people on the way out of the street . One of the raiders is also believed to have been carrying a handgun throughout the raid, which can be seen in the CCTV images. Eventually the staff managed to operate the security shutters and lock the gang out, causing them to flee. As they fled on their three mopeds, they nearly knocked over members of the public. Nothing was stolen from the store, but a security guard remains in hospital with potentially life-changing injuries, and several thousand pounds worth of damage was done. The incident is being investigated by Flying Squad officers of the London Metropolitan Police based at Putney, in south west London. Anyone with information should call police on 020 8785 8655 or to remain anonymous call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.","CCTV footage released by police shows the six robbers' failed robbery bid .

And we have not been made aware of any such issue in communications with financial institutions to date,' Snyder said by email. 'We are very early in an ongoing forensic and criminal investigation.' 'To date, there is no evidence that unencrypted PIN data has been compromised,' Target said in a statement . The DMV revelations come at a time of heightened concern about data breaches following revelations of a massive theft of payment card records from Target Corp . The No. 3 U.S. retailer said last week that hackers stole data from as many as 40 million cards used at Target stores during the first three weeks of the holiday shopping season, making it the second-largest data breach in U.S. retail history. Target has not said how its systems were compromised, though it described the operation as 'sophisticated'. The U.S. Secret Service and the Justice . Department are investigating. Officials with both agencies have declined . comment on the investigations. The news comes as the retailer says it has learned of some incidents of scam emails related to its recent data breach. The company says it is aware of 'limited instances' of scam emails, but does not have specific information. The Minneapolis retailer says it is creating a section of its website for Target's official communications so customers can verify the authenticity of notes from the retailer. The attack could end up costing hundreds of millions of dollars, but it is unclear so far who will bear the expense. CBS News reports the company faces at least 15 lawsuits . seeking class action status as a result of the cyber-attack. The suits were filed by people who claim their information . was stolen, and they allege Target either failed to properly secure the . customer data, did not promptly notify customers of the breach or . both. But so little information disclosed so far about the breach, . it is unclear whether the plaintiffs will be able to prove their allegations. Hacked: The hackers who attacked Target and compromised more than 40 million credit cards and debit cards also allegedly managed to steal encrypted personal identification numbers . Denial: Target says 'no unencrypted PIN data was accessed' and that there was no evidence that PIN data has been 'compromised' Meanwhile, Democratic U.S. Senators, Richard Blumenthal of . Connecticut and Chuck Schumer of New York, have asked the U.S. Federal Trade . Commission to investigate the breach. 'If Target failed to adequately protect customer . information, it denied customers the protection that they rightly expect when a . business collects their personal information,' Blumenthal said in a letter to . FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez today. 'Its conduct would be unfair and . deceptive.' While . bank customers are typically not liable for losses because of . fraudulent activity on their credit and debit cards, JPMorgan Chase . & Co and Santander Bank said they have lowered limits on how much . cash customers can take out of teller machines and spend at stores. The . unprecedented move has led to complaints from consumer advocates about . the inconvenience it caused from the late November Thanksgiving holiday . into the run-up to Christmas. But sorting out account activity after a . fraudulent withdrawal could take a lot more time and be worse for . customers. JPMorgan has said it was able to reduce inconvenience . by giving customers new debit cards printed quickly at many of its . branches, and by keeping branches open for extended hours. A Santander . spokeswoman was not available for comment today. Security . experts said it is highly unusual for banks to reduce caps on . withdrawals, and the move likely reflects worries that PINs have fallen . into criminal hands, even if they are encrypted. 'That's a really . extreme measure to take,' said Avivah Litan, a Gartner analyst who . specializes in cyber security and fraud detection. 'They definitely . found something in the data that showed there was something happening . with cash withdrawals.' Litigation: Target reportedly faces at least 15 lawsuits seeking class action status . While the use of encryption codes may prevent amateur hackers from obtaining the digital keys to customer bank deposits, the concern is the coding cannot stop the kind of sophisticated cyber criminal who was able to infiltrate Target for three weeks. Daniel Clemens, CEO of Packet Ninjas, a cyber security consulting firm, said banks were prudent to lower debit card limits because they will not know for sure if Target's PIN encryption was infallible until the investigation is completed. As an example of potential vulnerabilities in PIN encryption, Clemens said he once worked for a retailer who hired his firm to hack into its network to find security vulnerabilities. He was able to access the closely guarded digital 'key' used to unscramble encrypted PINs, which he said surprised his client, who thought the data was secure. In other cases, hackers can get PINs by using a tool known as a 'RAM scraper', which captures the PINs while they are temporarily stored in memory, Clemens said. The attack on Target began on November 27, the day before the Thanksgiving holiday and continued until December 15. Banks that issue debit and credit cards learned about the breach on December 18, and Target publicly disclosed the loss of personal account data on December 19. On December 21, JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, alerted two million of its debit cardholders that it was lowering the daily limits on ATM withdrawals to $100 and capping store purchases with their cards at $500. On Monday, the bank partly eased the limits it had imposed on Saturday, setting them at $250 a day for ATM withdrawals and $1,000 a day for purchases. (The usual debit card daily limits are $200 to $500 for cash withdrawals and $500 for purchases, a bank spokeswoman said last week.) On Monday, Santander - a unit of Spain's Banco Santander - followed suit, lowering the daily limits on cash withdrawals and purchases on Santander and Sovereign branded debit and credit cards of customers who used them at Target when the breach occurred. Santander did not disclose the new limits, but said it was monitoring the accounts and issuing new cards to customers who were affected. The largest breach against a U.S. retailer, uncovered in 2007 at TJX Cos Inc, led to the theft of data from more than 90 million credit cards over about 18 months.","Target hackers allegedly stole encrypted PINS in 'sophisticated' operation .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Ukip is preparing for a ‘vicious, insulting and borderline libelous’ attacks from the Labour party in the run-up to the European elections, Nigel Farage revealed today. The Ukip leader said he now expects to make the biggest electoral gains in Labour’s industrial heartlands, when he predicts an onslaught from Ed Miliband’s party. It comes after Labour revealed it has hired a dedicated official to monitor Ukip’s activities. Ukip leader Nigel Farage said his party now stood to make the biggest gains against Labour . A new YouGov poll today puts Ukip on 10 per cent. It includes 13 per cent of people who voted Tory in 2010, 10 per cent of Lib Dems and 4 per cent of Labour supporters at the last general elections. Labour and Ukip are to go head-to-head in the battle to come first in the European elections on May 22. The Tories are widely expected to come third. Mr Farage told MailOnline he is prepared for a panicked Labour party to descend into dirty politics. ‘The untold story of British politics is that we are hammering working class votes and the Labour party has only just begun to wake up to it,’ Mr Farage said. Labour's Douglas Alexander said the party did not underestimate the threat posed by Ukip . ‘We are now the working class party. The upside potential for Ukip now comes more from Labour than anywhere.’ He said he would be focussing resources and campaign spending on the Midlands and northern seats where Labour dominates. ‘They will be vicious, insulting and much of what they say will border on libellous. They will have they trade union bully-boy friends helping them. They have got unite against fascism groups lobbying outside our meetings. ‘We know all too well how the Labour party will behave.’ It comes as Labour  revealed it has dedicated staff working on countering the threat from Ukip. Douglas Alexander, the party’s election –co-rindator and shadow foreign secretary,  said: ‘I take Ukip very seriously. The truth is that Ukip presents an electoral challenge to all political parties. ‘The way to defeat Ukip is not to be a better Ukip but to be a better Labour Party,’ he told The Independent. ‘That means making sure the EU works better for Britain but also tackling the cost of living crisis, promoting jobs and growth and protecting the NHS. ‘We have got staff dedicated to exposing the gap between the rhetoric of Ukip and its record. Inevitably, Ukip’s policies will come under sustained scrutiny in the weeks and months ahead.’ UKIP Director of Communications Patrick O'Flynn: 'Labour has finally woken up to the fact that the UKIP message is resonating in working class communities. 'Ordinary working families increasingly realise that the Labour Party no longer stands up for their interests and that only UKIP offers a solution to the uncontrolled immigration that is compressing wages and placing pressure on schools, hospitals and other public services.'","Labour election guru Douglas Alexander reveals fear of Ukip threat .

"By . Emma Glanfield . Marc Burnett, 30, from Preston, East Yorkshire, swindled £226,508 in 45 false transactions while working as a senior banking advisor at Lloyds Bank . A senior financial advisor has walked free from court despite stealing more than £200,000 from the life savings of six pensioners and blowing it all on football bets. Marc Burnett, 30, a senior banking advisor for Lloyds Bank, used standing orders to siphon money from the unknowing pensioners’ accounts into ones he 'controlled'. Burnett, of Preston, East Yorkshire, stole £226,508 in 45 false transactions between 2008 and 2013 to fund his gambling habit - which started when he was just ten-years-old. Hull Crown Court heard how he ensured his elderly victim’s did not find out about his swindling by diverting their bank statements. Burnett’s bosses at Lloyds Bank were also duped by his behaviour and the court heard how his senior managers knew nothing of his withdrawals. Phillips Evans, prosecuting, said Burnett came across as ‘charming and polite’ to his victims despite swindling them for their life savings behind their backs. He said: ‘The accounts he stole money from were not randomly selected from the computer. ‘They were people Mr Burnett met face to face or on the telephone and then swindled them of their life saving. ‘He targeted six customer accounts. One has since died and the other cannot be found. They approached him for financial advice and they trusted him with their life savings.’ Burnett, who served in the RAF when he was younger, pleaded guilty to six charges of fraud after his swindling was uncovered by bosses while he was on a two-week holiday in June last year. Defence barrister Anil Murray said his gambling spiralled out of control after winning £1,800 from a £10 bet when he was 21. He said: ‘In his early 20s he had a flat of his own in the town and he would gamble online on football. ‘He started working for Lloyds and his addiction became worse spending all of his money as soon as he got paid. ‘He started putting bigger and bigger bets on with the aim of winning big. The aim was to repay his debts, but of course the win never came. He would put between £150 and £4,000 on and it spiralled. ‘He lost his flat. He could not see a way out of the debt and began stealing. His thinking was distorted. He became low and depressed. He knew he would be caught.’ Hull Crown Court, pictured, heard how Burnett, of Preston, Lancashire, stole £226,508 in 45 false transactions between 2008 and 2013 to fund his gambling habit . He said Burnett had since split up with his girlfriend and moved back in with his mother and is now attending a gambling anonymous group after last placing a bet on February 8. In a statement read out in court, victim Paul Barron told how he felt ‘betrayed’ by the fraudster. He said: ‘My trust had been completely breached. What made it worse was he advised me to close my accounts with other banks and pool all my money with Lloyds.’ Fellow victim Mary Orvis said: ‘He was a nice smart, young fellow. I felt he had targeted me.’ And Alan Shippey, who was also targeted by Burnett, said: ‘I placed my trust in the bank to look after my finances. I’m angry about what he has done.’ Lloyds Bank dismissed Burnett when the fraudulent behaviour came to light and the firm has since refunded all of the money back to his victims. Sentencing, Recorder Jonathan Carroll told Burnett: ‘What you have done drives a dagger into the heart of the banking system and the trust that people must feel in their banks. ‘Their rewards for hard work in life must be saved. These people saw you as a charming young man. ‘In your case you made unauthorised standing orders, closed down account and moved money to your own all to fund your gambling addiction. It is an addiction you have to tackle. ‘I have thought long and hard about whether I can suspend your sentence of two years imprisonment. ‘It is clear you are remorseful, not just to the bank, but also to the customers you stole from.’ He added: 'It cannot be said this was out of character because you have been gambling for 10 years. Your family are distraught at your behaviour which is understandable because you are a gambling thief.' Lloyds Bank declined to say which branch Burnett worked at but said in a statement: 'We take our customers' security very seriously and work closely with the police to combat fraud.'In this case, the fraud was swiftly identified by the bank and we notified the police and the relevant authorities and assisted fully in their investigation.' Burnett was handed a two year suspended sentence and ordered to carry out 300 hours of unpaid work.","Marc Burnett swindled the money in 45 transactions over a five-year period .

"By . Ted Thornhill . Kim Jong-un clearly still has a burning desire to smoke, with recent pictures showing him puffing away on an airfield and sitting next to an ashtray at a shooting range. If the North Korean leader isn’t smoking in photographs, an ashtray is often in close proximity. Consideration for others while he smokes is, perhaps unsurprisingly, a low priority, with a photograph released in 2013 showing him smoking in a hospital. Scroll down for video . Can't kick the habit: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un smokes a cigarette as he attends a flight exercise of the KPA Air and Anti-Air Force Unit 188  in Pyongyang . He had apparently stressed to workers at Taesongsan General Hospital in Pyongyang that hospitals should be ‘neat and splendid and dust-free’. And in December he was pictured with cigarette in hand in a command centre after North Korea launched a satellite. On Tuesday the North Korean Central News Agency released a picture of Jong-un and his customary ashtray at a shooting practice in Pyongyang. He is seen laughing heartily with army chiefs as he holds a pair of binoculars. Familiar sight: Jong-un's customary ash tray sits nearby as the dictator watches a military exercise in Pyongyang . Another picture shows the leader wearing a big grin and smoking while standing next to a North Korean fighter jet. The pictures emerged as China dismissed a UN report alleging North Korea has committed crimes against humanity. It effectively confirmed the fears of human rights advocates that Beijing will shield its ally from international prosecution. The report, published in February, accused the reclusive country of mass killings and torture comparable to Nazi-era atrocities and said officials, possibly even Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un himself, should face the International Criminal Court (ICC). Not a picture of health: Jong-Un enjoys a cigarette at the Taesongsan General Hospital . Space race: Jong-Un smokes a cigarette in North Korea's satellite command centre after the successful launch of a satellite in December 2012 . Never far away: Kim Jong-un sits near an ash tray at a shooting contest of army teaching staff . Chen Chuandong, a counsellor at China's mission in Geneva, told the U.N. Human Rights Council that the independent commission of inquiry had made unfounded accusations and recommendations that were ‘divorced from reality’. ‘The inability of the commission to get support and cooperation from the country concerned makes it impossible for the commission to carry out its mandate in an impartial, objective and effective manner,’ Chen said. China, as a member of the U.N. Security Council, would have the power to veto any move to refer North Korea to the Hague-based ICC. Diplomats had already warned China was likely to object to the report, which also criticised Beijing for its treatment of North Korean defectors. But Michael Kirby, chief author of the report, said he was convinced North Korea's leadership would eventually face the ICC for crimes documented in the commission's archives, which hold the testimonies of hundreds of witnesses. ‘I have lived long enough to see things that looked impossible come to full fruit,’ Kirby told a news conference.","Kim Jong-un is often pictured smoking a cigarette or sitting by an ashtray .

"By . Dan Bloom . Tourism chiefs in Scotland have claimed the crippling lack of mobile and internet signal in rural areas is a good thing - because it is sparking 'digital detox' holidays. The report by Visit Scotland said the 'joy of missing out' on e-mails, texts and Facebook is creating a generation of niche breaks devoted to the 'novelty of Luddism!' But business leaders attacked the plan - pointing out Visit Scotland's own figures which say visitors complain about internet access more than any other issue. Switching off: Walkers in the Torridon mountains in the north west Highlands. Tourism agency Visit Scotland has said the lack of mobile and internet signal can be marketed as a good thing for 'digital detoxes' 'Hello? We're in Scotland!' The idea was one of 17 trends but was criticised by business leaders . The idea was listed as one of 17 'trends for 2014' in a report for the taxpayer-funded body which included 'Mod-stalgia' ('embracing the past through the comforts of today'), 'techspectations' ('life is becoming more digital every day') and 'never pay full price for pizza'. The report said: 'Overuse of smartphones, the rejection of technology will see consumers seeking meaningful and emotional experiences. Scotland’s off-grid locations will enable this. Signal failures: The service for mobile operator O2 is notably lacking in the Scottish Highlands . 'The novelty of Luddism! Although technology is and will be a driving force for many years to come with tourism, some providers have identified a niche market for those who want to escape digital life (albeit temporarily). 'Health and wellbeing tourism has excelled in recent years with the use of low cost gyms, and healthy eating. 'Psychological health is also identified as an area for growth, with many providers offering packages such as ""Tai Chi"" breaks in the Scottish Highlands as a means of escape from everyday digital life, providing an opportunity for consumers to detach from life, and regenerate.' The report did admit the breaks - which were identified as something that had grown through 2013 - would not be popular with everyone. It added: 'Although the majority of consumers . would not see this as a positive aspect, many would identify Scotland as . a destination to escape and ""detach"" from the digital world.' Much of Scotland's most beautiful and isolated countryside is poorly-served by mobile phone firms. The Highlands and islands are affected especially badly, because of their difficult terrain and thinly-spread population. In VisitScotland's latest visitor report, 45 per cent of people said they had not been satisfied with internet access - more than for any other issue. It compared to 42 per cent who complained about the cost of travel, 41 per cent about the convenience of sea routes and 34 per cent about mobile reception. End of the earth? Walkers on the West Highland Way. Firms have started offering Tai Chi breaks . Natural beauty: The gaping skies above Ben Loyal. The Highlands have been a popular getaway for centuries . The idea has caught on among some - with one new firm, digitaldetoxing.com, offering £299-a-head breaks in a Norfolk cottage with strictly no screens allowed. The firm took a group on a 'secret' trip to Mallorca earlier this year and plans a visit to Scotland in May. But Marc Crothall, chief executive of the Scottish Tourism Alliance, criticised the idea. 'For 25 per cent of the country not to have proper mobile phone access is just not good enough for the modern day,' he said. 'We need to have full coverage across the whole country as soon as possible.'","Report by Visit Scotland praised what it called 'the novelty of Luddism'

"By . Jason Groves . Struggle: Jim and Tracy Sahie with their sons . George Osborne shunned Tory calls to overhaul the 40p tax rate yesterday – as he  again focused resources on basic-rate taxpayers. The Chancellor announced the starting threshold for paying income tax would rise again to £10,500 next year, delivering a £100 tax cut just before the election. Mr Osborne also confirmed that the threshold at which individuals start paying the higher rate will be raised this year for the first time since the 2010 general election – but by just 1 per cent this year and a further 1 per cent in 2015. Accountants Grant Thornton warned the failure to raise the threshold in line with inflation would result in an extra 411,000 people being dragged into paying the 40p rate by 2016. The higher rate threshold will rise from £41,450 today to £41,865 next month before rising to £42,285 next year. But the figure remains well below the £43,875 threshold inherited by the Coalition, who brought it down to £42,475 in 2011-12, froze it in 2012-2013 and cut it again to £41,450 last year. The number of people paying 40p tax has soared from just over three million in 2010 to 4.4million this year and is set to rise to more than 4.8million by 2016. Senior Tories had pressed for the higher rate threshold to be increased to at least £44,000 to ease the pressure on the huge numbers of ordinary workers now forced to pay it. But Liberal Democrat Danny Alexander, Chief Secretary to  the Treasury, boasted last night that his party had vetoed any further action. Mr Alexander said he had refused to listen to ‘siren voices in the Conservative Party’ calling for action on the issue. Former Tory Cabinet minister John Redwood welcomed Mr Osborne’s slight raise to the 40p tax threshold but said he should have been much bolder. ‘I’m glad there was some movement, but we would have liked it to go further,’ he said. ‘We wanted the Chancellor to recognise that people earning just over £40,000 are not rich and should not be taxed as if they are. But unfortunately there are always compromises in coalition.’ Mark Littlewood, director general at the Institute of Economic Affairs, said the failure to overhaul the 40p rate was a ‘missed opportunity’. He added: ‘Under George Osborne nearly 1.5million more taxpayers are paying this rate. ‘This is an attack on aspiration and entrepreneurship. Whilst the increase in the personal allowance is a welcome move, it should not have come at the expense of tax cuts in other areas.’ The starting threshold for paying income tax will rise from £9,440 to £10,000 next month and to £10,500 next year. Mr Osborne yesterday stressed the long-term progress on raising the basic-rate threshold, which stood at just £6,500 in 2010. Delivering the Budget: Chancellor George Osborne in the Commons today . He said 25million people had benefited from a tax cut as a result, with three million lifted out of income tax altogether. Basic-rate taxpayers will pay £800 a year less in income tax by the time of the election. The Chancellor said higher rate taxpayers earning less than £100,000 would receive the ‘full benefit’ of the latest increases. But Alison Hill, tax director at accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers, questioned the claim, saying the benefit was ‘not being passed on to those on the cusp of the higher rate tax threshold’. ‘The personal allowance will increase by £560 this year, however the higher rate tax threshold  has only been increased by £415,’ she said. ‘Therefore there is still an actual reduction in the basic rate tax band of £145 – not as generous as it might have seemed.’ Ukip leader Nigel Farage said it was ‘amazing’ that a Conservative chancellor would enter the next general election with a lower 40p threshold than he inherited from the previous government. ‘Lots of aspirational families will be forgiven for wondering why they bother to go the extra mile. The danger for the economy is that some will simply stop doing so.’","Threshold for paying income tax will rise to £10,500 - a £100 tax cut .

"By . Wills Robinson . Horrified: Gerardine Stockford says children around the country are being exposed to school texts which contain foul language and explicit material . A mother-of-two who was abused on Mumsnet for suggesting her daughter should not be studying a foul-mouthed play as called for age restrictions on school books. Gerardine Stockford, a vicar's wife, was horrified when her 14-year-old daughter brought home the gritty drama Mogadishu, which contains 218 uses of the F-word and ten of the C-word – as part of her GCSE drama course. She expressed her dismay on the parenting forum by setting up a feed, but deleted it after teachers responded aggressively. The former social worker, 52, believes the use of the sexually explicit play, which also touches on self-harm and violence, shows some teachers do not know the difference between right and wrong and proves that 'anything can end up in the classroom'. She also suggests that if there are age restrictions on films and a watershed on television, there should be similar controls at school. Mrs Stockford told MailOnline: 'The play is full of explicit language, including sexual content. It is shocking that material like this is being fed into young people without parents knowing. 'If there are ratings in films and a watershed in TV, there is a sense there needs to be similar restrictions in schools. 'I wouldn't let my daughter watch a 15 certificate film at home. If it isn't acceptable somewhere else, why is it acceptable at school.' The play, which was written by Vivienne Franzmann and is set in a tough London secondary school, was broadcast on the BBC in 2011 after the watershed. It is ridden with racial abuse and at one point a teacher is called 'batty' and one of the main characters says 'Suck my ****' to a schoolgirl. Mrs Stockford's daughter studied the play at Teddington School in Richmond for two terms as part of her GCSE drama course. One Mumsnet user, who claimed to be a . teacher, responded: ‘Censorship – that’s what you want. So you can . impose your middle- England, white, middle-class values on a world that . no longer exists. ‘As a . teacher, I will say very bluntly how sick and f****** tired  I am of . parents like you who think they are experts on all f****** areas of the . curriculum.’ Another said: . ‘This really, really p***** me off .  .  . I teach and have had . half-***ed complaints from parents on occasion .  .  . What really boils . my p*** is people having opinions about things they haven’t even read . and certainly don’t understand.’ She says that she would not let her daughter watch a 15 certificate film at home, so questions why she is subjected to swearing and sexual content at school . Mrs Stockford added: 'It . hasn't put me off. It has shown what some teachers are like, it has made . me more determined to challenge it. 'The play is being used all over the country. To me now I have seen its the tip of the iceberg and its not acceptable. 'There is a problem here. In schools you expect children to be safeguarded and this is going on without a parent's knowledge. 'There needs to be some controls. If there are no limits, how far could you go? Teddington School in Richmond claims that Mrs Stockford is the only parent to have complained about the use of the play at the school . 'There are some teachers that have no sense of right and wrong and are prepared to use these materials. This stuff could be potentially damaging. 'Anything can end up in a classroom. An 11 year-old could pick up a library book with this sort of material in. 'We . are not talking about a few swear words. If you remove the offensive . language, the foundation of the play is for it to be as shocking and . offensive as it can.' Mrs Stockford gave an extract of the play to Vince Cable in a bid to highlight the explicit content and asked 'would you read this'. Reply: A letter from the acting headteacher of Teddington School to Mrs Stockford, justifying the use of the play . Support: A letter from Education Secretary Michael Gove to Mrs Stockford's MP Vince Cable. He says: 'as a father myself, however, I do share Mrs Stockford's concern' A letter from the Department for Education says the school have the final say over what texts they study . He told her there was an inconsistency in the policy and he subsequently passed the letter on to Michael Gove . The acting headteacher, Jeremy Law, wrote a long letter back to Mrs Stockford, justifying the use of the play, suggesting she was the only parent to have complained. 'He compared it to Shakespeare and Chaucher. The problem with Mogadishu is it is current and you can be drawn in to the reality. 'I have also been in contact with a father-of-three in Devon. He responded to the letter because he had an issue with sexually explicit language in his daughter's library book.' She said the old headteacher, who had to retire due to ill health, would have been horrified and a teacher at another school 'couldn't believe it.' 'The few parents I have spoken to were horrified this was going on. I have now set up a petition.' When deciding on what play's pupils should study, schools can choose from a selection of texts set out by exam boards. Edexcel, a body who runs GCSE drama courses, offers titles by playwrights such as Shakespeare and Arthur Miller, but do not recommend Mogadishu. Chris McGovern from the Campaign for Real Education said: 'Children . at school should receive the same protection as that provided by the TV 9 . o'clock ""watershed"". She has written to Education Secretary Michael Gove and has started a petition to introduce age restrictions on school texts . 'The BBC's broadcasting of ""Mogadishu"" back in . 2011 commenced at 9.45 pm. The plays excessive use of foul language and . disturbing themes that include racism, bullying, self-harm and suicide were . judged by the BBC as unsuitable for youngsters. 'True, . there are disturbing themes in Shakespeare and, even, in many fairy tales but . it is the. immediacy of ""Mogadishu"" that causes concern. I am not . aware that Shakespeare wrote a play about a London comprehensive school.' 'In . essence, we are dealing here with a child protection issue and the protection . rules that apply to TV and cinema should apply in the classroom. A Department for Education spokesman said: 'We expect schools to alert parents before a text of this nature is taught and to give parents the option of withdrawing their children from these classes. Any investigation would examine whether the school followed these steps.' Norman Wells from the Family Education Trust added: 'It is a matter for great concern that any school should consider a text littered with foul language appropriate for classroom use. No family newspaper could publish extracts from this play and neither could it be screened before the watershed. 'Requiring pupils to take offensive words on their lips in drama lessons will do nothing to encourage pupils to use appropriate language in a polite, thoughtful and constructive way. Rather, it will tend to break down their inhibitions and normalise the concentrated use of foul speech. 'The government ought to be able to trust teachers to select appropriate texts for pupils to study in its schools. 'However, the fact that some teachers have become so insensitised that they appear to consider nothing off-limits suggests that further action is required.' The play, written by Vivienne Franzman,  is set in a tough London secondary school . Mogadishu, written by Vivienne Franzman, is set in a tough London secondary school. It concerns a white teacher who is trying to protect a black student from being expelled. Amanda, a teacher is pushed to the ground by a black student named Jason when she tries to intervene in a fight. Ignoring the advice of Becky, her daughter, who suggests she should report the incident, Amanda resists telling the headmaster, Chris, for fear of ruining Jason's future. Knowing Jason's history, the teacher feels sorry for Jason. Finally persuaded, the next day she mentions the incident to Chris who is suspicious of why she has waited so long. There is racial abuse and a teacher is called 'batty', slang for gay and one of the main characters snarls at a schoolgirl: 'Suck my ****.' In previous controversies, some have argued that the exam or educational use of Simon Stephens's great modern play Punk Rock. It surrounds a Columbine-like school shooting at a British academy, with many suggesting it could encourage vulnerable students to mimic the actions. Mogadishu is part of a selection of plays certain schools can study during GCSE and A-Levels. Teachers can choose from a number of titles by playwrights such as Shakespeare, Chaucer and Arthur Miller, but many opt for the gritty drama instead.","Gerardine Stockford, 52, says there should be censorship in school books .

"By . Tamara Cohen . David Cameron has publicly acknowledged that rival Boris Johnson wants to be Prime Minister - but said he still wanted him back as an MP. Discussing the Mayor of London’s political ambitions in an interview, the Prime Minister admitted for the first time that Mr Johnson ‘wants my job’. But instead of trying to keep him away from the House of Commons, Mr Cameron described Mr Johnson using a footballing analogy as a ‘great striker’ who he wanted back in his team. Pointing the finger: David Cameron (right) has acknowledged that rival Boris Johnson (left) wants to be PM . Mr Johnson has promised to serve out the whole of his second term as Mayor, which ends in 2016, but Mr Cameron raised the possibility he could stand as MP at the same time as running London. The Mail revealed earlier this month that Mr Johnson was being urged to return to the Commons at the general election by Mr Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne. Allies said both of them were urging him to ‘get stuck in’ to the campaign by standing in 2015, and some Tories even suggested he could be offered a senior role such as party chairman. However, the Prime Minister today goes further in his public support for Mr Johnson’s return to the Commons. Speaking to The Sun, the Prime Minister suggested Mr Johnson could even be his successor, saying: ‘It wouldn’t be a great job to have if people didn’t want it. There is nothing ignoble about wanting my job’. Cheered on: The Prime Minister went further in his public support for Mr Johnson's return to the Commons . As to whether he should stand at the next election, Mr Cameron said: ‘That is what I think he should do. I want to get him back in Parliament’. ‘It’s a bit like football, if you have . got a great striker you want him on the pitch. He can complete as Mayor, . or he can stay on as Mayor and come back to the House. I want him on . the team.’ 'It’s a bit like football, if you have got a great striker you want him on the pitch... I want him on the team' David Cameron . Mr Cameron, who attended Eton and Oxford University with Boris Johnson, said he had unique qualities. ‘He has an amazing capacity to defy gravity that other politicians don’t. And also he is fun. ‘I find him genuinely amusing.’ But he added: ‘Underneath there is quite a serious person beavering away.’ The Prime Minister first made a direct overture to Mr Johnson at the Conservative party conference in October but did not comment on what the timetable for this might be. Family time: Earlier this week, Stanley Johnson (right), father of Boris Johnson (left), called for a change in the rules so his son could stand as leader of the party without being an MP . He said at the time: ‘My message to Boris is, “You’re a brilliant Mayor of London, you’ve done a great job, you’ve got a lot more to give to public life and it would be great to have you back in the Commons”. But that’s up to him.’ 'He has an amazing capacity to defy gravity that other politicians don’t. And also he is fun. I find him genuinely amusing' David Cameron . The Mayor has encouraged speculation over the years about whether he wants to be Tory leader. But Mr Johnson’s allies say he is sceptical of recent attempts to woo him back to the Commons before the next election as an attempt to call his bluff. Earlier this week, Mr Johnson’s father, Stanley Johnson, called for a change in the rules so his son could stand as leader of the party without being an MP – suggesting this could happen if Mr Cameron loses the next election and the party seeks a fresh direction. A leadership bid would infuriate the Chancellor as Mr Osborne, backed by the education secretary Michael Gove, also carries ambitious for the top job if the Conservatives flop at the next election. Mr Johnson angrily told supporters this month he felt the attempt to bring him back into the fold next year was at attempt to ‘tie him in’ if the Tories lose.","David Cameron says he wants 'great striker' Boris Johnson in his team .

"By . Mark Duell . Financial action should be taken against Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich over Russia’s annexation of Crimea, a prominent opposition politician in the country claimed last night. Prime Minister David Cameron and US President Barack Obama were told by opposition leader Alexey Navalny that Western governments should seize wealthy Russian businessmen’s assets. Mr Navalny - a former candidate for Moscow mayor - said there should be sanctions against oligarchs who have made a home in the West, like 47-year-old Russian Mr Abramovich. Rich: A politician said Western governments should seize the assets of wealthy Russian businessmen, including Roman Abramovich (left, with girlfriend Dasha Zhukova) and Alisher Usmanov (right, with wife Irina) 'The invasion of Ukraine has polarised members of Russia’s elite, many of whom view it as reckless,' Mr Navalny, 37, wrote in the New York Times. 'Real sanctions, such as blocking access to their plush London apartments, will show that Mr Putin’s folly comes with serious costs.' In addition, Mr Navalny suggested that the assets of Arsenal FC major shareholder Alisher Usmanov, 60, who is worth £11billion, should also be seized. Mr Abramovich is worth £5.5billion. The comments come as it was announced European Union leaders will today sign a trade deal with Ukraine - designed to give economic support to the beleaguered state in the Crimean crisis. Mr Cameron and others agreed last night to add 12 names to the list of top figures from the Moscow regime to face travel bans and asset freezes, after what he called ‘unacceptable’ actions by Russia. US President Mr Obama stepped up . action by putting oligarch businessmen - including Vladimir Putin's . banker Yury Kovalchuk - on a blacklist of regime figures who will face . sanctions from America. Speaking out: Russian opposition leader Alexey  Navalny - a former candidate for Moscow mayor - said there should also be sanctions against oligarchs who have made a home in the West, like Mr Abramovich . Suggestion: Prime Minister David Cameron (left) and US President Barack Obama (right) were told by a Russian opposition politician that Western governments should seize wealthy Russian businessmen's assets . After talks which continued into the early hours in Brussels, European Council president Herman van Rompuy announced the decision to extend sanctions against Russian officials. He said that a planned EU-Russia summit in June had been cancelled, adding: ‘Russia's annexation of Crimea and of Sevastopol is a clear violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and of international law.’ 'Real . sanctions, such as blocking access to their plush London apartments, . will show that Mr. Putin’s folly comes with serious costs' Alexey Navalny, Russian opposition leader . ‘We strongly condemn the unconstitutional referendum in Crimea. We will not recognise the annexation, nor will we recognise it in the future. There is no place for the use of force and coercion to change borders on the European continent in the 21st Century. ‘In the absence of de-escalation from Russia, the European Council has decided to expand the list of individuals subject to visa bans and asset freezes. We put forward a list of 12 names to add to the 21 agreed earlier this week.’ He added: ‘Any steps by Russia to . destabliise Ukraine will have far-reaching consequences. By that we mean . consequences on relations in a broad range of economic areas. We ask . the Commission and the member states to prepare possible targeted . measures.’ Mr Obama's announcement of travel bans . and asset freezes was met with a Cold War-style tit-for-tat retaliation . by Moscow, which announced its own blacklist of US politicians, . including House Speaker John Boehner and former presidential candidate . John McCain. Annexed: Russian President Vladimir Putin signs a treaty for Crimea to join Russia in the Kremlin on Tuesday . Flying the flag: Ukrainian soldiers and armoured personnel carriers guard a checkpoint yesterday near the village of Salkovo, in Kherson region, adjacent to Crimea . Mr McCain . tweeted a defiant response, saying: ‘I'm proud to be sanctioned by Putin . - I'll never cease my efforts and dedication to freedom and . independence of Ukraine, which includes Crimea.’ Mr Obama signed a presidential order . paving the way for measures targeting key sectors of the Russian economy . if the situation in Ukraine worsens. 'There is no place for the use of force and coercion to change borders on the European continent in the 21st Century' Herman van Rompuy, European Council president . The blacklist of 20 individuals unveiled by Mr Obama in Washington also included prominent businessman Gennady Timchenko and billionaire brothers Arkady and Boris Rotenberg, who were judo sparring partners of the Russian president, as well as Mr Putin's chief of staff Sergei Ivanov, Duma Speaker Sergei Naryshkin and Russian Railways chairman Vladimir Yakunin. Mr Kovalchuk's Rossiya bank, which counts many senior officials among its clients, was the first institution to face sanctions. Justifying the move to sanction private businessmen, Mr Obama said he was targeting ‘individuals with substantial resources and influence who provide material support to the Russian leadership as well as a bank which provides material support to these individuals’. Mr Usmanov and Mr Abramovich both have no public connection to 61-year-old Mr Putin or the Russian government, reported the Daily Telegraph.","Opposition leader suggests wealthy Russians' assets should be seized .

"By . Shari Miller . The wallet of a German soldier killed on the battlefield during the First World War will finally be returned to his family after 100 years, thanks to the efforts of two Britons who set out to 'do the right thing'. Friends Ivor White, 85, from North Tyneside, and Dennis Picton, who now lives in Australia, have spent the last six months tracing the family of the soldier, who was killed around 1914. The wallet - pierced by the very bullet that killed its owner - belonged to Herman Karl Ernst Musold and contains a German Iron Cross military medal, a picture of Kaiser Wilhelm II and payment coupons. Detective work: Ivor White from North Tyneside has tracked down the grandson of a German soldier killed in 1914, whose wallet has been in his family for 100 years . Patriotic: The wallet contained an Iron Cross medal, a book of coupons and a picture of Kaiser Wilhelm II . It was picked up from the battlefield by Vic Garside - Mr White's step-father, who was a driver in the Royal Army Service Corps, and has been kept by his family in Tyneside ever since. But he was unsure how to trace the original owner's family, until Mr Picton offered to help. 'We got chatting and I showed him the wallet and he became very interested in it. 'He said he'd try and trace the original owner's family and sure enough, he has. 'I didn't think it could be done but they seem to be delighted we got in touch.' Mr Picton, who lives in Adelaide, said: 'I scoured the internet and came up with the addresses of archives in Germany. 'The first one had seen its records destroyed by floods in the 1970s, but eventually I located one which deals with the history of those who fought for the German army.' The pair were eventually able to trace the soldier's grandson, Wolfgang Musold, who lives in Rathenow, a small town in the district of Havelland in Brandenburg. Identity: The official papers carried by the soldier name him as Herman Karl Ernst Musold . Historic: Ivor White is pleased he can return the war memorabilia to the soldier's family . War-torn: Ivor White holds the wallet pierced by a bullet passed and right, its historic World War One contents . The town is reportedly the place where Adolf Hitler was secretly buried alongside Eva Braun, as well as Joseph Goebbels and his family. Letters have been exchanged and Mr White is preparing to post the wallet back to Mr Musold. Mr Picton said: 'I am pleased for Ivor in that he was really keen to find the man's family. 'He wanted to get the stuff back and I am sure the relatives will be very pleased to have a bit of family history back.' Mr White added: 'I'm glad they'll get it back. It seemed the right thing to do.'","Ivor White and Dennis Picton were determined to find wallet owner's family .

"By . Dan Bloom . The world's oldest 20 horsepower Rolls-Royce has sold for more than £25,000 after it was discovered rusting in a remote Welsh barn. Enthusiasts thought the 1922 Goshawk prototype, nicknamed 'Cindarella' by its developers, was scrapped until it was spotted hidden under farm equipment by a former owner. Experts say it could easily be worth £150,000 once it is fully restored - but getting it up to that standard may cost £100,000. Rare find: Enthusiasts thought the 1922 Goshawk prototype, nicknamed 'Cindarella' developers, was scrapped until it was spotted hidden under farm equipment by a former owner. It has since been in a private museum . Rusting: The car sold for more than £25,000 but could cost £100,000 to restore to its original condition . Prototype: The car racked up more than 20,000 miles in extensive tests, including in 1922 in France, pictured . The Rolls-Royce 20 - whose chassis number is 6G2 - is one of just seven experimental vehicles built in 1922 and code-named Goshawk. The firm which was famous for the overly extravagant Silver Ghost used the prototype to develop a new, smaller Rolls-Royce for the more austere world after the First World War. The prototype, whose original numberplate was CH2927, was trialled in England and France and racked up 20,000 miles before it was pensioned off in October 1925. It was sold to a Mr G Palgrave-Brown from Suffolk, who kept it until at least the 1940s. But the car's trail went cold after that, and another chassis - 4G2 - was officially granted the honour of the oldest surviving Rolls-Royce 20. A trader bought 6G2 in 1982, by which time its huge significance had faded into distant memory. Prestigious: A previous seller was asked to examine the car and realised he had owned it 14 years earlier . Detective: The valuer then painstakingly tracked down the compelling history of the chassis . Fixer-upper: After its true value went neglected for so long, there is some serious work to be done on the car . The name Rolls-Royce is synonymous with over-the-top luxury, but for a brief period in the 1920s the firm made a firm push towards the middle-class. Until 1922, the only Rolls available had been the hulking Silver Ghost, introduced in 1907 with a huge engine of more than 7,000cc. With a top speed of 62mph, the 20 horsepower car - nicknamed the 'Baby Rolls' - was aimed towards owner-drivers instead of those with chauffeurs. It became popular with the burgeoning inter-war middle classes of doctors, solicitors and businessmen. At 4,118cc, prototype 6G2's engine was more powerful than the 3,127cc model which would go into general production. Its top speed was also lower, at between 47 and 50mph on a road with stable conditions . But despite the experiment, Rolls' reputation would be firmly cemented as the car of Britain's very richest. The famous four-door Phantom I, an example of extreme luxury, was developed just three years later in 1925. Sources: Rolls Royce / Brightwells . He sold it the next year to a collector in Wales who, not knowing how important it was, left it to rust. Fourteen . years passed, and the trader built up a far fuller knowledge of . Rolls-Royce cars. By sheer chance, when Welsh owner rediscovered the car . and decided to have it valued, the expert was none other than its . original seller from the 1980s. The . thrilled trader bought it back and established its authenticity, and . the car was reunited with its title of the oldest 20 horsepower . Rolls-Royce in the world. After keeping it in his private museum of classic cars for more than a decade, he decided to have it auctioned. The car was sold with its original instruction manual and spare parts including an engine block, front road springs, windscreen parts and floorboards. It sold for £25,520 yesterday when it went under the hammer at Brightwells Auctioneers in Leominster, Herefordshire. James Dennison, Brightwells classic car sales consultant, said: 'To find the remains of an ancient vehicle slumbering in a barn is exciting enough. 'It’s every car buff’s dream to find an historic motorcar slumbering in a barn. Happier times: The car (left) being tested in the south of France in 1922 with another prototype, 4G2 (right), which would later claim the title of the oldest 20 horsepower Rolls-Royce when 6G2 was thought lost . History: The car was even sold with its original 92-year-old instruction manual . 'But when that vehicle turns out to be a long-last artefact of historical importance, the thrill is all the greater. 'Fourteen . years passed, during which the vendor, now a committed Rolls-Royce 20 . enthusiast, had owned a whole string of these fine cars and got to know . them inside out. 'When he . next stumbled across the chassis he had sold all those years before, he . immediately noticed that there was something intriguing about it. 'The . more he looked, the more intriguing it got, sparking off years of . painstaking research culminating in the chassis being officially . recognised for what it was - the oldest Rolls-Royce 20 in existence. 'It needs a lot of work doing to it. You could easily spend £100,000 on it if you gave it to a professional.'","Enthusiasts thought 1922 Goshawk prototype was scrapped 70 years ago .

"By . Tamara Cohen . and Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Lord Tebbit suggested sales of junk food would be higher in areas where food banks are most popular . People use food banks to get basic items free and spend their remaining cash on junk food, Lord Tebbit claimed yesterday. The former Cabinet minister said there was a ‘near infinite demand’ for anything free. The Tory peer was speaking in a House of Lords debate about food banks – which Labour claim are booming because Coalition austerity policies leave many people unable to make ends meet. But Lord Tebbit suggested more people were using them because the number of banks has increased and they would prefer not to pay for food. It follows research showing the number of families claiming they are going hungry has fallen over the past five years – as the number of food banks has risen. The peer said: ‘There is always a near infinite demand for valuable goods that are given away free. ‘One can even notice it in the catering departments of this building. If food is given away at prices grossly below the markets more is used.’ He invited environment minister Lord de Mauley to ‘initiate some research into the sales of junk food in areas where  people are living for their basic food on the food banks’. The minister declined. Earlier this month Tory welfare minister Lord Freud said the demand for food banks was difficult to understand. ‘Clearly nobody goes to a food bank willingly,’ he added. ‘However, it is very hard to know why people go to them.’ The intervention came after a series of peers in the House of Lords had called on the Government to tackle the scale of food bank usage in the UK. Lord Palmer, an independent crossbench peer, said it was a ‘scandal in today’s society that food banks have to exist at all’. Labour peers’ leader Baroness Royall . of Blaisdon said food banks in the South West gave aid to more than . 40,000 adults and 20,000 children last year. She . described it as down to ‘desperate pressing demand due to a cost of . living crisis’ and called for Lord de Mauley to visit one. Lord de Mauley said he had visited a food bank and they were run by ‘wonderful people and donated to by hugely generous folk’. The Government has repeatedly questioned whether food banks are responding to growing need . ‘They perform a very valuable service distributing food to people who really need it and they tend to operate at a local level,’ he said. ‘Britain has a great tradition of charitable giving and I think it would be a bad day when we started to interfere with that.’ Only 8.1 per cent of Britons admitted to being unable to afford food in 2012, down from 9.8 per cent in 2007 . Last . year Tory Education Secretary Michael Gove sparked outrage when he . claimed families become so poor they are forced to turn to food banks . because of their own ‘decisions’. He suggested that many cash-strapped families have brought their problems on themselves.He added: ‘I appreciate that there are families who face considerable pressures. ‘Those . pressures are often the result of decisions that they have taken which . mean they are not best able to manage their finances. ‘We need to ensure that support is not just financial, and that the right decisions are made.’ A study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found Britons were among the least likely in the developed world to say there were times when they could not afford food, an international report found. Only 8.1 per cent reported this in 2012, down from 9.8 per cent in 2007 – before the economic crisis and when Labour was in power. The study, which represents industrialised nations, flies in the face of Left-wing claims that cuts in public spending are leaving thousands of families going hungry. The number of food banks has increased over the past few years, with charities claiming that more than half a million people across the country have visited them. It emerged this month that more than a third of councils are subsidising food banks at a cost of £3million to the taxpayer. While most town halls paid for support such as management and administration, some were even paying for the food.","Former Tory minister says there is a 'near infinite demand' for anything free .

"By . Martin Ziegler, Press Association . UK Sport has rejected appeals against its decision to withdraw funding from Olympics sports basketball, synchronised swimming and women’s water polo. The funding body has also stood by its decision to cut all funds from Paralympics sports goalball, visually-impaired football and wheelchair fencing. UK Sport has changed its decision about women’s weightlifting and reinstated money totalling £894,000 in the build-up to the Rio 2016 Olympics, while badminton has been awarded an extra £250,000. UK Sport chairman Rod Carr admitted that the decisions on zero funding, confirming the original announcement last month, would be unpopular in some quarters. Cut: Drew Sullivan competes for Great Britain against Russia at the 2012 Olympics Game in London . Cut: Funding for British basketball from UK Sport has been cut because the chances of winning medals is low . Happier days: Sisters Jenna and Asha Randall in 2012 - funding for the Synchronised Swimming team is cut . Withdrawn: UK Sport will not be providing any financial support to  Women's Water Polo either . He said: 'I accept that by its very nature ‘No Compromise’ is not universally popular but there’s one thing we are sure of - it works. 'The recent outstanding successes at the Sochi 2014 Olympic and Paralympic Games demonstrated once again that investing the right money, in the right athletes, for the right reasons, is a winning formula.' Carr added: 'The starting point for UK Sport and the Board is that we want to be able to invest in as many Olympic and Paralympic sports as possible but they must be able to credibly demonstrate medal-winning potential within eight years. 'Weightlifting came back to us with a compelling new strategy focussed on developing their most talented female athletes with a view to challenging for medals by Tokyo 2020.' Strategy: UK Sport says it is only backing sports which have a serious chance of winning medals in eight years . Also on the list: Paralympic sports such as goalball - with Team GB Pictured here - has also seen its funding slashed . Decision reversed: UK Sport has changed its mind over women's weightlifting and will continue funding it . Carr said sports that are not at that level would still receive public funding driving from bodies such as Sport England which aim to boost grass-roots participation and talent development. British Swimming called on sports minister Helen Grant to intervene and said it would consider a formal appeal to the independent Sports Resolutions UK body. 'This is a very dark and sad day for British sport - especially for women’s sport,' said British Swimming chief executive David Sparkes. 'How can an elite programme such as synchro, which has long been held by UK Sport as a model of world class athlete development and leadership, that has achieved all of its performance indicators since it first received funding, have its funding removed just 12 months after it was enhanced? On target: Funding for the Paralympian sport of wheelchair fencing has also been completely removed . 'It is a sport that has never failed to deliver on its performance promises and this decision beggars belief - it clearly highlights a fundamental flaw in the UK Sport funding system. 'On behalf of water polo, synchro and other Olympic sports that face the real possibility of dying out as a result of today’s announcement, we call on the sports minister to show leadership in this area by looking at the entire funding system for elite sport.”","UK Sport has decided to withdraw funds from Olympic sports basketball, synchronised swimming and women's water polo .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . It was an image posted on Twitter by a seemingly trustworthy source that appeared to capture the on-going heartache suffered by so many in Syria. And within hours it been retweeted thousands of times. But now it has emerged a picture of a four-year-old boy called Marwan wandering in the desert, separated from his family, may have been misleading. In fact, he wasn't alone at all - he was just a little way behind a large group of people. The picture was initially put on Twitter by Andrew Harper, the UNHCR representative . to Jordan, who took the picture. Scroll down for video . This newly-released picture shows a Syria boy pictured alone was actually crossing border with family . Desert walk: In the picture that was tweeted, Marwan, four, was helped by aid workers close to the border of Jordan and Syria . His caption, which read 'Here 4 year old Marwan, who was temporarily separated . from his family, is assisted by UNHCR staff to cross',  did not cause the sensation. It . was only when Hala Gorani, the CNN news anchor, put it up with the . caption 'crossing the desert alone after being separated from family . fleeing Syria' that interest in the story took hold. Now . a wider shot of the scene has emerged taken by Jared Kohler, a UNHCR . photographer. It shows several hundred refugees, streaming over the . border from Syria to Jordan. And, Marwan stumbling over the desert . ground, just a few meters off to the side. Aid workers helped the boy cross the . border into Jordan and a follow-up tweet from Mr Harper today let the . world know that Marwan's family had been found. Marwan was helped to cross the border into Jordan by UN aid workers after he became temporarily separated from his family. The little boy was reunited with his mother once he reached the refugee camp . Marwan is one of more than one million children who have been forced to flee Syria as a result of the country's devastating civil war . 'Just to let you know that Marwan was safely reunited [with] his mother soon after being carried across the Jordan border,' he shared on Twitter, along with a second picture of the boy being carried by an aid worker. It is unclear how long the boy was separated from his family. A reporter tweeted on Monday evening that a UNHCR official said Marwan was only 20 steps behind his family after he became lost during the confusion of the crossing. Nonetheless, the picture of the isolated boy has struck a chord, perhaps because it serves as a reminder of the many young children who have lost or become separated from their families due to the conflict. The picture of Marwan was one in a series of pictures posted by Mr Harper in the last few months, as the aid worker documents the ‘endless tide’ of refugees fleeing Syria into Jordan. This week, Mr Harper has also published photos of Malala Yousafzai, the young education activist shot by Taliban gunmen while on a school bus in 2012, who has been at the Jordanian refugee camp, meeting with refugees and helping them to cross the border. Last year, Antonio Guterres, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees called the conflict in Syria ‘a disgraceful humanitarian calamity with suffering and displacement unparalleled in recent history’. The Syrian civil war started with popular protests across the country in 2011 during the Arab Spring, which turned into an armed conflict after the Syrian army fired on demonstrators across the country. Different areas of the country are under government or opposition control and skirmishes take place across the country. More than 130,000 people have been killed since the conflict began and  2.5 million people, including an estimated one million children, have been forced to flee the country. An additional 5 million people are internally displaced in Syria. Most of these refugees have fled to camps in the neighbouring countries of Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, and Turkey. Jordan, to the south of Syria, has taken in more refugees than any other country, with 613,104 refugees residing there at time of writing, according to UNHCR reports. More than 160,000 refugees currently live in the Zataari refugee camp, just south of the Jordanian border with Syria. It is now Jordan's fifth largest city. 16-year-old education activist Malala Yousafzai was in Jordan to witness life in the refugee caps and offer a hand to those coming across the border from Syria . Malala reached out to greet one young refugee, one of the many children forced from their homeland of Syria by the conflict .

Antonio Guterres, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees called the conflict in Syria 'a disgraceful humanitarian calamity with suffering and displacement unparalleled in recent history' The Zaatari refugee camp is home to more than 160,000 people who have fled from Syria in the north. The refugee camp, which is now the fifth largest city in Jordan, has seen an increased rate of arrivals in the last few months . The refugees have set up 3,000 shops and restaurants in the  camp, as well as a taxi service, schools, soccer fields and hospitals. In a demonstration of the refugees' resilience, the camp even has wedding dress boutiques, which rent out wedding dresses, and provides facials and hairdressing services to Syrian brides. Refugee arrivals into the Zataari camp peaked between January and April 2013, with 4,000 refugees arriving in one day. The rate of arrivals, which slowed in the second half of the year, picked up again in December 2013, with approximately 5,000 refugees entering the camp in the last week of the year, according to a report published jointly by the WFP, UNICEF and UNHCR. Earlier this month a ceasefire was ordered, meaning that civilians in the Syrian city of Homs, which is currently held by opposition troops, could be evacuated. Several thousand people were evacuated during the period of truce, which was mediated by the UN. Humanitarian aid was also permitted to enter the city. The United Nations halted the evacuation early after reports that dozens of men aged 15 to 55 who attempted to leave Homs during the evacuation had been detained by Syrian authorities. The UN said it would halt the ceasefire until they knew the fate of the men, reported CBS news.","Picture of Marwan, four, who was found by UN workers wandering the desert, may be misleading .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A food fight between senior citizens broke out at a Golden Corral this week which led to one 64-year-old woman being charged with assault and battery. A plate of food went flying at the salad bar of a restaurant in Wilkesboro, North Carolina on Tuesday during the early bird dinner sitting. The trouble broke out at 3.45pm after Polly Richards, 64, allegedly purposely bumped into Linwood Moore, 69, at the salad bar. Showdown at the Golden Corrall: Polly Richards, 64, was charged with assault and battery after throwing a plate of food during an early bird dinner at the chain restaurant in Wilkesboro, North Carolina . According to witnesses and surveillance footage, Richards cursed at Mr Moore and pushed him against the wall and slapped him in the face, WITN reported. Mr Moore, who recently had heart surgery, said he was afraid Richards was going to hurt him so he pushed her away, causing her to fall to the floor. Richards also threw a plate of food which hit Fay Cardwell, 62, smashing into her shin and knee. The altercation reportedly broke out because Mr Moore cut in front of Richards when she was getting a drink. On arrest, Richards reportedly told officers: 'Just take me to the f****** jail then.' The 64-year-old has been charged with two counts of assault and battery and is jailed on $1,500 bond. Golden Corral refused to comment about the incident to MailOnline on Friday. Golden Corral is a family-style chain featuring a large buffet, grill, carving station and bakery. It has  locations in 41 states and its headquarters are in Raleigh, North Carolina. The fight which injured two senior citizens allegedly broke out when a 64-year-old woman was annoyed that another man cut in line at the buffet (stock image)","A plate of food went flying at the salad .

"By . Jamie Redknapp . After a result like that, David Moyes must be thinking, ‘What is going to happen to me here?’ The game against Olympiacos on Wednesday is massive. If they go out, that is United done with Champions League football for 18 months. Moyes has only made two big signings, but they are not working for him. He spent £27.5million on Marouane Fellaini, but he has never looked a United player. And I’m a big fan of Juan Mata, but you don’t spend £37m on a player and play him out of position. VIDEO Scroll down to watch post-match reactions form David Moyes and Brendan Rodgers . Clueless: Danny Welbeck, Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney (left-right) look on after Liverpool's third . Frustration: Record £37million signing Juan Mata is being wrongly deployed on the wing . Down and out: The game was yet another nadir for David Moyes' troubled United reign . United have always had fantastic wingers but Mata is not a winger, and you make yourself look worse by playing him there. He needs to play in that No 10 position, but how do you sacrifice a man you’re paying £300,000 a week? Liverpool had seven British players and thoroughly deserved to win. The way they swarmed over United was amazing. Jordan Henderson was key. He covers so much ground and has added brilliant passing. Kop that: Liverpool, with Jordan Henderson (left) and Luis Suarez, overwhelmed United . Whenever you win a cup or a league, there is normally one moment along . the way that turns the momentum your way. When you look at Man City’s . result at Hull, and Chelsea’s at Aston Villa, this weekend could be that . moment. I said after City lost to Wigan and went out of the Champions . League to Barcelona that if they only win the Capital One Cup this . season that would be failure. But to play with 10 men for 80 minutes and . win comfortably shows you how good they are. Charging through: David Silva celebrates his goal for 10-man Manchester City at Hull . Missing in action: Misfiring striker Fernando Torres was poor again in Chelsea's loss at Villa Park . As soon as City went down . to 10 men, there were questions about their mentality. After all the . travel in midweek, they had a perfect excuse, but they proved a lot of . people wrong. Jose Mourinho has made his defence formidable but they . still lack that one striker up front who can change a game. Fernando . Torres was poor again and if Eden Hazard doesn’t spark, Chelsea don’t . have a forward man they can rely on. If they had a Diego Costa they . would be 10 points clear. When Liverpool went 1-0 up at United, they went for the throat but it was a different sort of performance from Arsenal at Tottenham. They showed great resilience and Laurent Koscielny and Per Mertesacker were magnificent at the back. I was critical of Mertesacker when he arrived in the Premier League, but I have to take my hat off to him now. He is so strong, great in the air and dominates strikers. He’s a proper defender and was crucial in keeping Tottenham at bay. With Chelsea losing and Arsenal, Liverpool and Man City all winning, it was perfect for the title race. What a finale we are in for. Lion's roar: Per Mertesacker has proven doubters wrong with another sterling performance at Spurs . On the up: Liverpool's win puts them in touching distance of the top of the Premier League table . Felix Magath isn’t afraid to throw his youngsters in at the deep end. After making his debut at Cardiff, Cauley Woodrow led the line again for Fulham at Craven Cottage. The 19-year-old has been on loan at Southend but now he’s started back-to-back league games and probably can’t believe what’s happened to him. He held the ball up well and did a good job — now he just needs to grab a goal or two. Fulham’s goal difference  is minus 35 and that could prove costly at the end of the season. Nobody wants to go down on goal difference. Young gun: Fulham striker Cauley Woodrow challenges Newcastle's Fabio Coloccini . It has been a rough few weeks for West Brom but winning at Swansea was a massive result. A few weeks ago the bottom three looked set, but how can you predict it now? All it takes is one loss and you’re dragged right back into it. It hasn’t worked for West Brom either, sacking Steve Clarke and bringing in Pepe Mel, but it was good to see Stephane Sessegnon back in the goals. In action: It was good to see Stephane Sessegnon (right) back in the goals for West Brom . He made a decent start when he arrived from Sunderland and was playing well under Clarke. But he has been hampered by injuries recently, which is a shame because he is the kind of player who can make a difference. He has pace and links the play well alongside the powerful Victor Anichebe. They are a handful for any defender. I was pleased to see Jermain Defoe get his Canadian career off to a flyer. The striker scored two goals in seven minutes as Toronto beat Seattle Sounders 2-1. I don’t think you can be surprised by any transfer deal Tottenham make, but it was a shame to see him leave as he’s still a top  goalscorer. Now the MLS will find out all about his talents. On target: Jermain Defoe netted twice on his MLS debut for Toronto FC . What a goal from Fabian Delph, and what an important win for Aston Villa. Chelsea will moan about some decisions but Villa played with great determination and thoroughly deserved their win. The performance was driven in that midfield engine room, and that’s no surprise when you look at the manager. Paul Lambert was a good midfielder and a Champions League winner and is doing a fine job developing his young players, none more so than Delph and his sidekick Ashley Westwood. Westwood doesn’t give the ball away and has got great drive in his game. Cheeky flick: Fabian Delph pulled off a sublime piece of skill to hand Aston Villa a win over Chelsea . Although there was a lot of fuss around Delph at Leeds, he has struggled with injuries. Now he’s showing what he’s capable of. He has scored some great goals this season, but his finish against Chelsea was the best of the lot. He started the move and finished it with a sublime flick. I was with the maestro Gianfranco Zola in the studio on Saturday and he was hugely impressed. Praise doesn’t come any higher than that.","Chelsea losing means this weekend could be crucial in the title race .

The film, by Netherlands-based art director Thomas Jullien, includes images of popular Instagram subjects, such as iconic landmarks such as the Empire State Building, the wings of an airplane and sunsets as well as everyday objects like the shoes on our feet.

"By . John Watson . John Watson competed in 152 Formula One races over 10 years. He won five times, including the 1981 British Grand Prix for McLaren, and scored 169 career points. After leaving the sport in 1985, Watson has forged a successful media career, and today he writes for MailOnline. Ahead of the new season, which starts in Melbourne this weekend, Watson gives his verdict on who he thinks will win the title, Red Bull's reliability woes, and why his former team McLaren must finish in the top three this year. I have to say Mercedes. They are the best prepared in terms of every element and they are quick. You are going to see a whole raft of development going on and they have got the budget to be able to do that. They have the money, the talent and the equipment. On the one hand you have got Lewis Hamilton who is very exciting, and on the other, you have Nico Rosberg who drives more with his head. The fuel will be a factor so how you use, as to abuse your tyres, will be key, so I think Rosberg has the advantage on that level, and he probably shades it. For raw speed Lewis might have him. In the spotlight: Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg will start as the favourites to win this year's F1 title . It comes down to the pace of development. Red Bull have got a fantastic car, but it suffers through overheating and their new engine parts. The way that it is packaged is, in part Renault's responsibility, but also the way Red Bull go about their engineering - they take it to the absolute limit. They are on the outside edge of that limit and as a consequence they will suffer from reliability problems. But they have got the capacity, in terms of people and budget, to turn it around very quickly. I would not be surprised if we see Red Bull returning to the front of the grid. They will be winning a race or more before mid-season, but whether they can recover and dominate as they did at the end of last year will be a very difficult challenge for them at this stage. All smiles: But Sebastian Vettel will face an uphill challenge to defend his Formula One title this term . Under fire: But John Watson expects Red Bull to win at least one race before mid-season . Christian loves talking. He has become a media babe and he loves the camera and the microphone. Even when the team is struggling he is still there talking away. I would hate to think he is becoming the story,instead of the messenger... The difference is when reliability was an issue we did not have the global TV coverage that we do today. I don't want to see a grand prix where potentially a number of cars will fail to qualify and will be outside the 107 per cent rule. I don't want drivers either with a car which are incapable of running 20 laps before they retire, and even that may be optimistic. All this is a consequence of these very radical changes in regulations. Maybe the people who made the new rules should have looked at it from a reliability perspective and not gone quite so radical as they have done. There are three fully-funded teams on the grid – Ferrari, Red Bull and Mercedes. Everybody else is funded by degrees, and some teams are still probably paying off the bills from 2012 let alone 2013, so they will take longer to get over the reliability problems. You will then see the top three teams dominating.  McLaren will be amongst them, but it is a question of how competitive they are going to be. Some teams may run slower than a GP2 car and that would be a travesty. Felipe Massa seems to have found himself in a really good place. Williams have a competitive car. They have got the right engine and for a driver like Felipe who has been somewhat subjugated with Michael Schumacher and then Fernando Alonso. He is now at a team where he can be Felipe Massa. Contender: Felipe Massa may spring a surprise for Williams this season following his move from Ferrari . The team are impressed with him and I am sure he will be delighted that the car is competitive. It does depend whether Williams can sustain it over the season and mix it with the top teams. I would also like to see Kevin Magnussen do to Jenson Button what Alain Prost did to me in 1980 – a young guy coming in and doing an outstanding job, taking on and maybe getting the better of his more established partner. Dream team? Kimi Raikkonen and Fernando Alonso . They are both great drivers and great world champions, and they are both diametrically opposed in terms of personality. My only concern about Raikkonen coming back is that Alonso is such a good operator of every element so Raikkonen will have to do a lot more than he was doing at Lotus where in reality his then team-mate Romain Grosjean, was not challenging him. I would have thought that Alonso will be the dominant of the two drivers, but I cannot underestimate Kimi. I did underestimate him when he came back at Lotus, but the way he drives a racing car is a pleasure to watch, but he can't let the Ferrari garage be solely on Alonso's side. The . principle change at McLaren is Ron Dennis returning in a controlling . situation and part of the reason I am in Melbourne is to see a team I . was a member of reformed. In effect we now have a McLaren team that is . in the same state as it was 32 years ago. I want to see what that team . will do under Ron's leadership. But the problem McLaren have, is that it is like an ocean liner – it is massive. It has its own momentum and it takes time to get that under control and to turn it. It can't be changed by one individual coming in, but what that individual will do is set into motion a whole new process, thinking, commitment and motivation. Happy days: Jenson Button shares a joke with former team-mate Hamilton in the Melbourne paddock . Ron needs to ensure his team finish in the top three this year. He has to beat one of Red Bull, Ferrari and Mercedes and that is not going to be an easy task, but he has the advantage of that Mercedes engine. Jenson Button is a thinking racing driver and he knows how to win a race. When it comes to conserving fuel and tyres, Jenson has got that capacity and can win grands prix. He needs to make good use of the car in qualifying. I won my first grand prix in Austria at the circuit which was known then as the Osterreichring. Now it is called the Red Bull Ring and it is a shadow of its former magnificent self. There are a number of great tracks, but to me Monza IS Formula One. It always has been and it always will be. I went to Austin for the inaugural United States Grand Prix and that was fantastic. It is a wonderful circuit and a fantastic venue, but from a pure spectacle perspective Singapore wins hands down. I have no feeling for it one way or the other. It wouldn't have changed anything in 2013, and would not have changed an awful lot in 2012. If it is going to attract a bigger audience and reinvigorate the end of the season than I am happy. I think there is more chance that we'll get struck by lightning than it going down to the final race. In other words, no, it will be tied up before we get to Brazil. It will be a Mercedes-engine car which will win. We could have Massa as world champion but the most likely scenario is that it will be either Rosberg or Hamilton. John Watson was speaking to Phil Duncan .","Mercedes are in the best shape. They have the money, talent and equipment .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . They have killed off 500 actors, encouraged 'a moment's violence' at the Queen Mother's funeral and given pigs an unusual diet of, er... willies. These are the hilarious subtitle blunders that have aired on the BBC - leaving both staff and viewers lost for words. They are among many mistakes to have prompted a crackdown on the quality of subtitles - with a report set to be published by Ofcom this spring. One gaffe sees the broadcaster mark the Chinese New Year by welcoming viewers into the 'year of the whores'. Embarrassing: The BBC marks the Chinese New Year by welcoming viewers into the 'year of the whores' during a bulletin in January. The channel later insisted the error was acknowledged and quickly corrected - to 'horse' Error: A reporter's comment that 'pigs nibble anything, even wellies' takes on a different meaning when the last word is substituted for 'willies'. The mistake in 2011 later fuelled a Mock the Week subtitles gaffes segment . Mistake: Another blunder sees a court reporter quoted as saying: 'And the cat's pornography reading was low' The subtitling error, which happened during a bulletin at around 7pm on January 31, saw BBC News declare: ‘Welcome to the year of the whores. People around the globe . celebrate.’ However, the channel later insisted that the error was acknowledged and quickly corrected - to the 'year of the horse’. Another blunder sees a reporter's comment that 'pigs nibble anything, even wellies' take on a completely different meaning when the last word is substituted for 'willies'. The mistake, which happened during a news report in 2011, soon went viral on Twitter - and even fuelled a Mock the Week subtitles gaffes segment. Lost in translation: Last Sunday, the BBC struggled to get to grips with the name of footballer Adnan Junazaj - misspelling his name as 'Janet jazz, jazz jam'. However, it correctly spelled the names of other players . Hot prospect: Januzaj broke into the Manchester United team as a winger this season - despite only being 18 . And last Sunday, the BBC struggled to get to grips with the name . of 18-year-old winger, Adnan Junazaj, who broke into the . Manchester United team this season. The broadcaster correctly spelled the names of other United players Javier Hernandez, Robin van Persie, Wayne . Rooney and Juan Mata - before stumbling over the youngster's name. Seventy channels in the UK currently provide subtitling services, according to watchdog Ofcom. Most of these air pre-recorded programmes - for which, subtitling can be prepared in advance. This means that subtitles can be synchronised to images, edited to a reasonable reading speed and checked for errors. However, live programming and some pre-recorded programmes have to be subtitled live - leaving them prone to mistakes. These subtitles are delayed by several seconds and typically scroll across the screen. Source: http://media.ofcom.org.uk . Its hilarious attempts at janet, jazz, jazz and jam left those watching the . programme with subtitles scratching their heads as they tried to work out . what was actually being said. And it isn't the first time the BBC has misspelled a name to amusing effect. The broadcaster has previously . referred to Italian prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi as 'Mr Beryl Beryl' - while Labour leader Ed Miliband became 'Ed . Miller Band'. Meanwhile, former chief medical officer Sir Liam Donaldson was once dubbed 'Silly . and Admundsen' - with the National Union of Students renamed as the . National Union of Stew Departments. Other . blunders have seen the Ireland rugby team referred to as Island, the sale . of millions of puppies - not poppies - in Britain on Remembrance Day, a 'cat's pornography reading' disclosed during a court report and . a solemn call for silence become 'a moment's violence' during the Queen . Mother's funeral in 2002.

Shocking: A man sees his son Fraser's name changed to 'phrase whore' in one particularly toe-curling blunder . Fox or frost? The gaffes are not just restricted to News and Sports channels - with one of the broadcaster's Weather presenters previously subtitled as saying: 'they would be a few more mist and Fox patches' And when one BBC announcer revealed the Government was ‘making helpful . decisions’, deaf members of the audience would have been confused as to why politicians . were ‘making holes for surgeons’. The embarrassing gaffes are not just restricted to the BBC's News and Sports channels - with one of the broadcaster's Weather presenters previously subtitled as saying: 'they would be a few more mist and Fox patches'. And most of the blunders have not gone unnoticed with the public - with celebrities also picking up on the bizarre mistakes. Not just the BBC: ITV has previously misquoted star Engelbert Humperdinck as 'engle Bert humper distinct' Blunder: And This Morning once accidentally confused the word 'rate' for 'rape' during a fashion segment . In . June last year, Dr Christian Jessen tweeted: 'The typos on BBC news . subtitles are quite funny sometimes. Today ""500 actors are set to be . killed"" later corrected to ""500 badgers"". Phew!' However, the BBC is not the only broadcaster to have suffered hilarious subtitle gaffes - with 70 channels in the UK now providing a subtitling service. ITV has previously misquoted Eurovision star Engelbert Humperdinck as 'engle Bert humper distinct', while This Morning once accidentally confused the word 'rate' for 'rape' during a fashion segment. Last year, Ofcom demanded that broadcasters monitor the quality of subtitles, which are used by more than a million people, every six months for two years. Victims: The BBC has previously referred . to Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi (left) as 'Mr Beryl Beryl', . while Labour leader Ed Miliband (right) became 'Ed Miller Band' during . one of the broadcaster's news reports . A consultation which started in May suggested that problems began when pre-recorded programmes were delivered to broadcasters too late to allow subtitles to be prepared in advance. Ofcom will publish a report based on its findings in spring 2014, and use the evidence to decide is changes to the current guidelines are needed. A BBC spokesman said: 'We recognise that subtitling is a hugely important service, and we endeavour to ensure it is as accurate as possible. 'As with all broadcasters, there are occasions - particularly during live broadcasts - when mistakes inevitably occur, but we do all we can to keep this to a minimum and are constantly striving to deliver a reliable service.'","Blunders have aired on broadcaster's News, Sport and Weather channels .

"By . John Hall . Two out of three people think the current benefits system in Britain is 'unfit for purpose' and should be replaced by tougher regulations, a new poll has revealed. The survey of more than 1,800 people suggested the majority of Britons think the £208million-a-year welfare state is broken and should be scrapped in favour of new rules about who can claim benefits. The YouGov poll, commissioned by Channel 5, also revealed that 76 per cent oppose immigrants being allowed benefits in their first year of residency. Broken: The YouGov survey of more than 1,800 people suggested the majority of Britons think the £208million-a-year benefits system should be scrapped .

The poll comes ahead of a live television debate on the issue later this evening. Channel 5 is screening The Big Benefits Row: Live at 9pm to discuss research which shows huge public concern about the current system. The panel is due to include Benefits Street's White Dee who will give her view of the benefits system and tell her own story, as well as former London Mayor Ken Livingstone and ex-Tory MP Edwina Currie.

"By . Simon Jones . Manchester United are keeping a watching brief on Stoke City goalkeeper Asmir Begovic. United goalkeeping coach Chris Woods was in the stands for Stoke's win over Arsenal 10 days ago where 26-year-old Begovic kept a clean sheet. The Bosnia No 1 was the subject of strong interest from Sir Alex Ferguson a year ago but the upturn in David de Gea's form meant a £12million bid was put on ice. No 1 target: Manchester United have revives their interest in Stoke goalkeeper Asmir Begovic . Safe hands: Man United want Begovic as competition for current goalkeeper David de Gea . Flying: Manchester United have also targeted a move for Roma defender Mehdi Benatia (right) No interest: Contrary to reports, United are not considering a swoop for Arsenal's Thomas Vermaelen . Manchester City and Liverpool also showed interest in Begovic but the player has made it clear he will only leave if he has a chance of playing regular first-team football. United are not unhappy with De Gea but want better quality and improved competition in every position for next season. De Gea is not being pushed enough by Anders Lindegaard and United will weigh up options ahead of the summer. Stoke would want around £15m if they sold but have England keeper Jack Butland to call on should Begovic go. Push: United want a serious challenge to David de Gea's position as No 1 . De Gea and Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois have been linked with Real Madrid in Spanish media reports over recent days as Carlo Ancelotti considers bringing in a younger keeper for either Diego Lopez or Iker Casillas. Meanwhile, Manchester United, who are signing FC Zurich midfield prospect Dimitri Mfomo, 16, will hand trials to two footballers from India. The 16-year-olds Arko Dey and Rajeeb Roy were spotted by local scouts as part of United's soccer schools in Calcutta. United are also keen to bring . in at least one new centre back this summer to replace Nemanja Vidic. They would prefer experience, hence scouts looking at Mehdi Benatia at . Roma and Alex of PSG but David Moyes does not intend to pursue interest . in Arsenal's Thomas Vermaelen. Real . Madrid defender Sergio Ramos was someone they considered earlier in the . season but they are not alone. The 27-year-old, has been linked with . Manchester City also and is close friends with City winger Jesus Navas. Ramos's brother Rene confirmed to Marca at the weekend that English clubs had been in contact. 'Out . of respect for the club, I will simply say it is an English club,' said . Rene. 'There are some very interesting offers, but Ramos is at a club . where he wants to be. The world's best, in his eyes. And so we must say ''thank you very much for your interest, but no''.' Arsenal are showing interest in Southampton full back Calum Chambers. The 19-year-old is another product of Southampton's academy and signed a four year contract last summer. While most eyes have been fixed on the progress of Luke Shaw and Adam Lallana, Chambers has steadily developed into one of the Premier League's outstanding prospects and has established himself in the England U19 squad. He has been at Southampton since the age of eight alongside the likes of James Ward-Prowse, Harrison Reed and Sam Gallagher and is holding down the right-back berth ahead of competition from Nathaniel Clyne. Arsenal are weighing up replacements for Bacary Sagna as contract talks rumble on and Chambers is ticking most of the boxes. Prospect: Southampton's 19 year-old right-back Calum Chambers (right) has impressed Arsenal this season . Adventurous: Chambers has shown a natural instinct to get forward and join in on Southampton attacks . Red Bull Salzburg defender Martin Hinteregger is attracting more Premier League scouts by the week. Manchester United have been watching the 21-year-old since last summer, Arsenal and Newcastle have also been at Salzburg games while Liverpool saw him in action for Austria against Uruguay last week. There are reservations about whether the 6ft 3in defender, who can also play left back, is quite ready for the Premier League but, in watching him, eyes have also been drawn to his team-mates at Salzburg. Side-by-side: Martin Hinteregger (left) challenges Luis Suarez in a friendly for Austria against Uruguay . No nonsense: Hinteregger has been attracting interest from Man Utd, Arsenal, Liverpool and Newcastle . They outclassed Ajax in their recent Europa League tie winning 6-1 on aggregate and the reputations of young midfielders Kevin Kampl, 23, and Valon Berisha, 21, plus forwards Alan, 24, and Sadio Mane, 21, are fast developing. Newcastle are particularly keen on Senegalese winger Mane with Graham Carr watching in recent weeks and several clubs have watched Brazilian Alan on his way to 21 goals this season. However, he would struggle to gain a work permit. Cardiff City scout Tommy Johnson watched Halifax striker Lee Gregory at the weekend. The 25-year-old didn't disappoint as he scored a hat-trick in Halifax's 5-1 win at Hyde. Cardiff are weighing up all options for the summer and, with relegation still a possibility, wanted to check whether Gregory could step up a few levels. Cardiff missed out to Leicester in the bidding for Jamie Vardy from Fleetwood 18 months ago and Gregory has been likened to the 27-year-old Vardy in terms of style and goalscoring record. Reinforcements: Cardiff boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has sent his scouts to look over Halifax striker Lee Gregory . Blackburn and Barnsley were also represented on Saturday to see Gregory take his season's tally to 24 goals in 28 games. Gregory wants to break the 30-goal barrier before the end of the season and has been ruing a broken hand which ruled him out for 11 games earlier in the season. Cardiff are also showing interest in Leicester City's Andy King. The 25-year-old Wales midfielder has been in and out of the starting line-up this season but is eager to play his part in their promotion push before taking stock of his future in the summer. Fulham are continuing to watch Swedish teenage striker Tidjani Diawara. Scouts were present as the 15-year-old, who made his first team debut LAST season, played for Rynninge IK in their 5-0 Swedish Cup defeat against IF Elfsborg. Asked about Diawara's performance, Rynninge coach Peder Hessel told Nerikes Allehanda: 'He was completely cooked. It was a pity that he could not show a bit more, we heard that Fulham were here and looked at him. 'I hope they follow him for a long time, because today I think he was a bit taken aback by the gravity of the moment. 'There has been much written and talked about him recently, and it's not so easy to handle.' Admiring glances: Juventus are keen to bring Manchester City left-back Aleksander Kolarov in the summer .

"By . SIMON JONES . Manchester United and Chelsea on alert as target Cavani's agents hold talks in London . Liverpool, Manchester City, United, Arsenal and Chelsea are watching with interest as a contract wrangle unfolds over highly-rated Hamburg centre back Jonathan Tah. The Germany U17 captain turns 18 next Tuesday but signed a lucrative contract extension in November that is being challenged by his father and FIFA. Fifa rules dictate that players under 18 can only be tied down for a maximum of three years and any deal running for longer will not be recognised by the governing body. Wanted man: Five elite Premier League clubs are interested in Hamburg defender Jonathan Tah as he approaches his 18th birthday . His father Aquilas, who has been divorced from Jonathan's mother for three years, said: 'The contract is only in the interest of the HSV and the consultant and not in the interest of my son. I should never have him signed with them. I will go to court. 'According to FIFA rules, the contract is invalid because it is more than three years. This is not allowed for a minor. I will make sure that Adewunmi has nothing to do with my son.' His representative Akeem Adewunmi counters: 'The parents have signed, the boy has signed. Thus, the contract is valid. All this has its accuracy. Jonathan wants to stay until 2018 at HSV. Here people want to challenge something but there is nothing to challenge.' United and Arsenal have been following Tah since he was 15 and were hoping to bring him to England until Hamburg persuaded the boy to sign a three year contract on January 23, 2013. Ownership issue: Tah's father has threatened to take Hamburg to court over the length of his contract . However, Hamburg then extended his deal by a further two years on November 27, 2013, which is now being challenged. Tah, who has played 15 first team games this season, signed a deal that has a release clause set at £20.7million and earns him £2,490 a point this season on top of his basic salary for the first year. His basic increases each year with bonuses rising to £6,642 a point in his final year as well as increments in his salary and bonuses should he be capped a full international level. Manchester City have been linked with a £6m bid in recent weeks although Adewunmi said it was without foundation. Tied down? Tah's scout Sebastian Arnesen insists his future will be in Hamburg . Reports in Germany added to the intrigue, stating that City had been alerted to a possible deal by scout Sebastian Arnesen, who is the son of Frank who was the sporting director at Hamburg last year that tied Tah down to his initial contract. When he signed a contract last year Frank Arnesen hailed him claiming: 'He is the greatest defensive talent Hamburg has had. Jonathan is extremely strong, very fast, strong in the tackle and technically adept physically for his age. He has everything it takes to be a good defender. All the first division clubs in Spain, Germany and England want him but Tah's future lies in Hamburg.' It seems that could be put to the test in the coming months. City looking for low-cost Fares - and youngsters will get New York chance . Manchester City scouts were in the crowd at the Viareggo Cup youth tournament in Italy this week with Hellas Verona midfielder Mohamed Fares reputedly the main object of their attention. The 17-year-old Fares, a French midfielder with Algerian roots impressed against Lazio with Liverpool also having representatives in the stands. Meanwhile, City's youngsters will have the opportunity to play for New York City FC once the MLS franchise is up and running. The American side will be allowed to loan four players from their parent club in England and head coach Jason Kreis has been over to study potential signings for the 2015 season. Opportunities: Manchester City's youngsters will have the chance to play for New York City FC, the Major League Soccer franchise the English club are setting up under the stewardship of former player Claudio Reyna . The 41-year-old, who was appointed in January, told City's official website: 'We will have the ability to take four players on loan from the club here. So I'm looking a lot at the younger players and the U18s and the U21s at the moment and also the players that are out on loan. We'll have to get with those guys over the next six months to a year and see whether or not that's something they would like as well.' United show persistence in chase of Arsenal youngster Willock . Manchester United are continuing their pursuit of Arsenal prodigy Chris Willock. The 16-year-old has been training with the Arsenal first team and is contracted until July but has yet to sign up as a scholar. That means United could still sign him potentially for £300,000 compensation if the scholar forms remain unsigned. MailOnline revealed how Willock's elder brother Matty is already at United and they hope that can help persuade Chris to make the move north. Still chasing: Manchester United are still keen on reuniting Arsenal starlet Chris Willock (right) with his elder brother Matty . English elite chase Marseille's Lopez . Marseille midfielder Maxime Lopez is proving another draw for English scouts. Chelsea, Arsenal, City and Liverpool have again been among the clubs listed as visiting the Stade Velodrome on a frequent basis to study the 16-year-old. He has been playing in Marseille's Under-17 side but also appeared in this season's UEFA Youth League competition. He featured in all six of the French side's group games, playing against Arsenal, Borussia Dortmund and Napoli. Marseille believe he has already been offered deals to move to England with wages of up to £17,000 a month discussed. Wanted man: Marseille's Maxime Lopez, seen here playing against Arsenal in the UEFA Youth League this season, is being monitored by four top English clubs . Robben set to extend contract until 2017 . Arjen Robben is expected to sign a new contract at Bayern Munich this month as talks begin with his representatives and the club. The Dutchman's current deal expires in 2015, but is largely expected to agree a renewal until 2017. Boro deal for Mladenovic falls through . Middlesbrough's hopes of signing left-back Filip Mladenovic fell through yesterday as they failed to agree personal terms. The Serbia international, who had also attracted interest from Reading, had left Red Star Belgrade and was a free agent after they failed to pay his wages. The 22-year-old held talks at Boro and was wanted by Aitor Karanka but terms could not be agreed and he has flown to Poland to discuss terms with Legia Gdansk who offered better salary package. Deal off: Middlesbrough have missed out on Red Star Belgrade's Filip Mladenovic (right) after failing to agree personal terms . Gregory may get Football League chance after all . Lee Gregory may have failed to realise his dream of a football league transfer move on deadline day but it may yet happen for the Halifax Town striker. Electrician Gregory, 25, took a day off work last Friday in the hope of securing a transfer from Conference side Halifax to Championship Blackburn. However, the deal didn't come to fruition as Blackburn manager Gary Bowyer weighed up other options. After further talks with the Halifax chairman though, they will consider loan deals with a view to a permanent deal as now Doncaster, Burnley and Bolton pick up interest. Gregory has 21 goals in 25 games this season including a hat-trick against Salisbury on Tuesday night. League chance: Halifax striker Lee Gregory could go out on loan . Bits and pieces . Norwich City winger Jacob Murphy is looking to join Swindon Town on loan. The 18-year-old made his senior debut in the FA Cup draw with Fulham last month. Troubled Leeds are ready to send Paul Green to Ipswich on loan next week once the new owners give clearance on the financial breakdown of the deal with Ipswich picking up a percentage of his wages. League Two strugglers Bristol Rovers have signed striker Steven Gillespie on a deal until the end of the season. The 28-year-old, who was released by Fleetwood Town at the end of January, will help replace Ryan Brunt who suffered a season-ending knee injury.","Manchester clubs, Arsenal and Chelsea interested in Hamburg's Jonathan Tah .

"By . Emma Thomas . 'Be honest': Deputy PM Nick Clegg's plea to Cameron over plans for garden cities . The Government must be 'honest and upfront' about plans to build new garden cities in south east England, Nick Clegg has said. The Deputy Prime Minister acknowledged that the green belt was being 'eaten away' by urban sprawl and there was a need for the new planned cities rather than relying on further 'piecemeal' developments. He insisted that a plan for the new cities would be published and Mr Clegg said there was 'no point in hiding' from the fact that they were needed in the south east. The Daily Telegraph reported that a . draft proposal suggests two new settlements in Yalding, Kent and . Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire. In . an article for the newspaper Mr Clegg wrote: 'We cannot make the . mistakes of past governments and sit on our hands while a whole . generation of people are squeezed out of the housing market. It is our . duty to change the story. 'We must bring decades of indecision and stagnant political will to an end. That . is why I am a strong advocate of garden cities, where there is clear . local support and private sector appetite. In 2011, our housing strategy . committed us to publishing a prospectus for new garden cities and that . is exactly what we'll do.' The Government must be 'honest and upfront' about plans to build new garden cities in south east England . The current situation had led to 'bloated' towns and cities 'being forced to expand further bit by bit, and the green belt is being eaten away'. But Mr Clegg claimed garden cities could protect the countryside, and it would be possible to build them without concreting over the green belt, National Parks or Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Although he stopped short of identifying specific sites earmarked for development he said: 'We must also be honest and upfront about where they will be. There's no point in hiding from this: there is an arc around the south east of England where demand is past breaking point. 'The current situation is bad for the economy and places a massive strain on vital services. Where there is more work and more demand, we should bite the bullet and create garden towns and garden cities.' The Liberal Democrats have previously claimed the Conservatives are suppressing the report and party president Tim Farron accused the Tories of a 'Nimby attitude towards garden cities' which are likely to be in their political heartlands. Lib Dem leader Mr Clegg wrote: 'I believe that if we put aside partisan politics and think collectively about the housing needs of the next generation, we could set Britain on track for a major wave of new development, new jobs and new hope.' The idea of garden cities was first floated by Mr Clegg in 2012. Entire new towns and cities must be built across the country to tackle Britain’s housing crises, Nick Clegg said . The Deputy Prime Minister said it was time to ‘rediscover that proud tradition of creating new places’. Yalding: A draft proposal suggests  new settlements in Yalding, Kent and Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire . Gerrards Cross: A new settlement could be built in the Buckinghamshire town . In a speech to the National Housebuilding Council, Mr Clegg warned that without a dramatic increase in house building home ownership would remain a ‘pipe dream’ for a generation of young people. He said housebuilders should draw inspiration from the garden cities of early 20th century, such as Letchworth and Welwyn, and the new towns of the post-war era like Milton Keynes and Stevenage. Mr Clegg warned Britain is already building 100,000 fewer houses than is needed every year. He said that the shortage of homes for young people has created a 'generational shift' in the debate, with people becoming more receptive to the idea of new developments which in the past would have been strongly resisted.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . He has hopes of running the country in just 15 months. But Ed Miliband has been left off a list of Britain the 100 best-connected men in Britain. To add insult to injury, his brother David and spin doctor Tom Baldwin have both been included on the power list drawn up by GQ magazine. Labour leader Ed Miliband has not been included on the GQ list of Britain's 100 best-connected men . Ed Miliband's brother David, who lives in New York, has been included on the list along with Labour's chief adviser Tom Baldwin . Space has even been found for Labour’s education spokesman, Tristram Hunt, the TV historian who was only elected to the Commons in 2010. The list aims to identify men exercising influence by their networking not only in politics, but the media, business, sports, PR and culture. The top 100 are not ranked in order of importance, but politicians who make the cut include Prime Minister David Cameron and London mayor Boris Johnson. In a thinly-veiled swipe at Ed Miliband, GQ editor Dylan Jones insisted ‘connection is the new influence’. His brother David, who he beat in the race to be Labour leader, does not even live in the UK. The former foreign secretary - currently living in the US as president of aid charity International Rescue - is listed for ‘reinventing himself as a world-stage player’ by ‘schmoozing’ with media moguls and bankers, while his brother ‘struggles to reinvent Labour in time for the next election’. Mr Baldwin, Mr Miliband’s senior advisor on Communications and Strategy, is a former Times journalist who is described by GQ as ‘a cross between Alastair Campbell, Hunter S Thompson and Rasputin’ and ‘a general go-to fixer for every problem facing the leader of the opposition’. David Cameron, Prince Charles and Boris Johnson all made the grade for the list . Big names from the media include News Corp executive chairman Rupert Murdoch, BBC director general Lord Hall and CNN presenter Piers Morgan - a former GQ interviewer - while sport is represented by the likes of David Beckham and Andy Murray, art by potter Grayson Perry, TV host Stephen Fry and actors Idris Elba and Benedict Cumberbatch, and PR by Matthew Freud, described as ‘probably the best-connected man in Britain’. The magazine identifies each of the men on the list as a ‘connector’, ‘influencer’, ‘socialite’, ‘leader’ or ‘spider’ - the latter denoting people who ‘operate in more than one sector’. Mr Cameron, classed as a leader and a socialite, merits his place for ‘forging against all the odds a coalition government’ with Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg - who does not make the list - but ‘now has to get his own house in order and make the public case for a Conservative victory’ at the next election, said the magazine. Meanwhile, the Prince of Wales is hailed as a leader, influencer and connector who is acting as ‘a modest, but hugely influential deputy head of state, as the Queen, 87, begins to scale down her responsibilities’. The list was drawn up by GQ editor Dylan Jones (right) who last month collected an OBE alongside artist Grayson Perry . Mr Jones, who once wrote a biography of Mr Cameron and last week collected an OBE, said: ‘The era of traditional, top-down power is over; connection is the new influence and today's achievers operate via a free-flowing exchange of ideas, using social media and personal networks to create value and understanding. ‘In recognition of this we decided to partner with Editorial Intelligence, the knowledge networking business, to co-curate a list bringing together those who embody the power of ideas today in a circle of connections rather than a top-down Who's Who. ‘Surely this is the first list to include both Charles Windsor and Peter Tatchell side by side, as well as Ed Miliband's brother David and spin doctor Tom Baldwin, but not the Labour leader himself.’","GQ list of top 100 men exercising influence by their networking .

"More than 2,400 vacancies for nurses, engineers and chefs are being advertised in Bucharest . By . Emily Andrews . and Colin Fernandez . UPDATED: . 07:00 EST, 31 January 2012 . British bosses are offering thousands of jobs to Romanian workers as unemployment in the UK soars. Just days ago, officials revealed that the number of British unemployed had reached a 17-year high of 2.68million. But more than 2,400 vacancies, including roles for nurses, engineers, chefs and other skilled workers, are being advertised by an online recruitment agency in Bucharest. Young and on the dole: Young people are feeling a disproportionate impact from contraction in the jobs market . The firm says that British companies are trying to fill 2,434 new jobs with Romanian workers – making the UK a better bet for migrant workers than Germany, which is advertising 2,387 positions. Many of the posts in Britain are for medical positions, tourism professionals and skilled staff, with 25 per cent being offered to labourers and unskilled workers. Earlier this month, UK unemployment hit 8.4 per cent, its highest level since 1994. But official figures show that nine out of ten jobs created in 2010 went to foreign nationals. The Romanian website, TjobsRecruit, cheerily greets prospective job seekers with ‘New year, new job, new life!’ The vacancies, advertised in English, include 28 taxi driver jobs located all over the UK, nursing roles in care homes for £12 an hour, sales positions promising a minimum salary of £750 a month, junior doctors and aircraft engineers. The Britons missing out . There are also 80 vacancies at gastropubs, three-star and four-star hotels in Oxfordshire, Warwickshire, Sussex and Surrey. These include opportunities for waiters (£12,646 a year), housekeepers (£6.20 an hour), receptionists (£14,500 a year) maintenance workers (£7.28 an hour) and various kitchen posts from porters to head chefs. In 2010, the British Medical Association put the number of unemployed junior doctors in the UK at around 3,000. Yet the Romanian website is advertising for the junior doctor’s position of residential medical officer at hospitals across the UK. Henry Smith, Conservative MP for Crawley, West Sussex, said he was concerned that jobs such as junior chef positions were being advertised to outside Britain when unemployment within the country is so high. He went on: ‘Now we are in a global economic crisis we should be ensuring where possible jobs are filled by British people. ‘I can’t believe in the Crawley and Gatwick area there isn’t a suitably committed chef who is a resident of this country and cannot see why there is a requirement to advertise this job abroad, and that goes for other positions as well. ‘As a country we have become increasingly restricted by our membership of the EU to ensure local jobs are going to local people who are from this country. Turn for the worse: Unemployment and the numbers claiming jobless benefits are headed in the wrong direction. ‘This is still part of the problem, despite the Government introducing controls on people from Bulgaria and Romania. ‘I just don’t buy the argument that you can’t fill a job for a sous chef in a hotel kitchen in Gatwick locally or the commutable area. We are not talking about a highly specialist pieces of knowledge. ‘I’m sure there are plenty of sous chefs in Crawley who would jump at the chance to work in a top class hotel. ‘I think it is very irresponsible of whatever company is doing this.’ Helen Morgan, 31, was recently made redundant from her job in housekeeping at a hotel in Exeter. The mother-of-one said: ‘I have experience in quite a few areas of hospitality and thought I’d easily find something. ‘But I’ve been looking for a fortnight without any luck. It doesn’t surprise me that there are jobs being advertised abroad because I meet so many Eastern Europeans in the industry. ‘Most are perfectly nice and friendly and do a good job, but it’s annoying that they’re being recruited over British workers. I think the Government should step in and make sure the ads are placed here too.’ Phil McCabe, of the Forum of Private Business, said: ‘If there are British workers that are ready, willing and skilled enough to do these jobs then it is absolutely right that those jobs should be offered first to British workers. ‘However from talking to  our members, we have found that there is a shortage of skilled workers from the UK, and many people have basic skills lacking such as numeracy and literacy. ‘In addition young people’s attitudes are sometimes found to be lacking, so advertising in Romania possibly reflects this situation.’ There are a host of taxi driving jobs in the South West region being advertised in Romania, but there are 176,000 unemployed people already living there. Meanwhile in the South East, there are 276,000 jobless, yet seemingly many jobs available for hotel workers. Across Britain, youth unemployment has exceeded one million for the first time. TjobsRecruit was founded in 2009 by Calin Stfanescu  and Sebastian Niezgoda. According to its website, it is the largest recruitment ‘system in Central and East European.  The ‘T’, it says, stands for ‘trusted’.","More than 2,400 vacancies for nurses, engineers and chefs are being advertised in Bucharest .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Four Irish siblings detained by Egyptian authorities amid the outbreak of violence have not been charged with any offences, Ireland's junior foreign minister said. A diplomat from the Irish embassy in Cairo has secured access to see three young women and their teenage brother for the first time since they were jailed. Sisters Omaima Halawa, 20, Fatima, 22, and Somaia, 27, and their 17-year-old brother Ibrihim were detained in Tora prison after being caught up in the storming of the city's Al Fateh mosque by security forces on Saturday. Arrested: The Halawa siblings, Ibrihim, Fatima, Omaima and Somala (pictured left to right) are currently in a Cairo jail after getting caught up in protests at a mosque . Family: Hussein Halawa, pictured with Omama, is the imam of Ireland's largest mosque . Joe Costello, Minister of State at the . Department of Foreign Affairs, said an Irish official has met with the . four face-to-face and that they were well and in good spirits. 'The embassy has managed to visit them in detention, and they are all safe and well,' he said, . 'No . charges have been preferred at this time and naturally enough we are . delighted to have had a chance to meet with them, it was the first time . there has been any access since they were detained.' Mr Costello said all four are being kept together in the prison. Ibrihim is understood to have suffered a minor injury to his hand which medical staff have been asked to treat. It had been feared that the teenager may have fallen victim to beatings feared dished out to many held at the notorious jail. His . sister Nasaybi Halawa, at the family home in Dublin, said she had been . told that all the men at Tora prison had suffered violence at the hands . of guards. 'I was speaking to someone a few minutes ago and they told me that they saw my sister in Tora jail and I asked them about my brother,' Ms Halawa said. 'The person I'm speaking to told me they were beating men to hell. She doesn't know how my brother looks but she told me, ""I can guarantee for you, all the men were beaten there. They didn't exclude anyone from hitting them.""' The chaotic situation in Egypt has continued for the past two days, with mass killings reported on both sides of the political divide. Yesterday 36 Muslim Brotherhood members died while being transported to jail when police fired tear gas into their prison van, apparently after the detainees started a riot. This morning, militants in the lawless Sinai Peninsula ambushed two prison vans and killed 25 off-duty police officers in execution style. William Hague spoke out this morning to warn that the country would face 'years of turbulence' as civil conflict rages. Location: The siblings are being held in the Tora prison, where male inmates are routinely beaten . Ibrihim was arrested on Saturday along with his sisters Omaima, 20, Fatima, 22, and Somaia, 27. He . completed his school leaving certificate before the summer holiday, and . was due to hear back from the universities he applied to today. His . father, Sheikh Hussein Halawa - the imam of Ireland's largest mosque - . has appealed for the Irish Government to act quickly to free his . children from detention. Ms . Halawa said she was worried her siblings would be killed, telling RTE . Radio: 'There is no difference now between anyone. They can kill anyone. 'We don't know anything about my brother and sisters. We don't know if they are safe. 'We . don't know if they are eating or drinking, where they sleep now, . whether they have had any food since they left the home last time. We . don't know anything about them.' Carnage: The scene outside the Al Fateh mosque on Saturday, when the Halawa siblings were arrested . Flashpoint: The mosque, pictured, was the centre of campaigns against the military-backed interim regime . She admitted that her siblings had been involved in protests, but insisted that they were peaceful, adding: 'The people want democracy and other people want a coup. People in Egypt want democracy.' Tear gas was fired and heavy gunfire was heard before the mosque, in the Ramses area of Cairo, was cleared on Saturday. The Halawa siblings have made no direct contact with their family since. It is understood their mobile phones were seized. The . Irish Department of Foreign Affairs has said it continues to work . closely with counterparts in Egypt in a bid to secure the safe release . of the family. The Halawas had travelled to Egypt earlier this summer for a holiday and were joined by their mother a fortnight ago. They . were forced to seek sanctuary in the Al Fateh mosque on Friday after . violent clashes between supporters of ousted president Mohammed Morsi . and the security forces killed around 80 people. More than 800 people have died in the carnage that has followed a military crackdown over the past five days. Lockdown: Much of Cairo has been flooded with armoured vehicles and soldiers in a crackdown on protests . Army: Soldiers have been accused of massacring protesters demanding Mohammed Morsi's reinstatement . Hussein Halawa emigrated from Egypt to Ireland nearly two decades ago, and is now the imam of the Islamic Cultural Centre of Ireland in the Clonskeagh district of Dublin. Joe Costello, a minister at the Department of Foreign Affairs, today said that the siblings were 'in good health' and had made contact with a Turkish diplomat. The siblings will be taken to a prosecutors' office in Cairo this afternoon, with a representative from the local Irish Embassy. 'We will find out today what the attitudes of the authorities are towards the Halawas and we will be able to inform their father and sister back in Ireland,' Mr Costello said. 'It's good news that the Turkish diplomat spoke to them as late as yesterday and it's a relief to hear that they are in good form and that they have been kept together. 'That was a big concern, that they may have been separated. But we'll find out the attitude of the authorities today and we'll move from there.' Protests: Cairo has been wracked with violence since the deposition of president Mohammed Morsi . Confrontation: A soldier holds back the crowds outside Al Fateh as Islamists leave the mosque building . William Hague today admitted that the outlook for Egypt is 'very bleak' and said that Britain's influence in the region was 'limited'. The Foreign Secretary added that the events across the Middle East would echo for decades, but said he was optimistic about the future of democracy in the region. 'It is a very bleak situation, it is hard to under-estimate the hate and distrust on both sides of the politics in Egypt,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'But I would not accept there is nothing at all we can do about it. Our influence may be limited - it is a proudly independent country - and there may be years of turbulence in Egypt and other countries going through this profound debate about the nature of democracy and the role of religion in their society. 'We have to do our best to promote democratic institutions and political dialogue and to keep faith with the majority of Egyptians who just want a peaceful and stable country.' Mr Hague added: 'What is happening now in the Middle East is the most important event so far of the 21st century, even compared to the financial crisis we have been through and its impact on world affairs.' Tory MP Crispin Blunt criticised the UK Government's 'inadequate' response to the situation - and called for asset seizures and the dismissal of the Egyptian ambassador. Mr Blunt, who has visited the country twice since the military-backed removal of Mr Morsi, accused Mr Hague of failing to understand the gravity of the events or to stand up for British values.","Irish diplomat was able to see the siblings in jail in Cairo's Tora prison .

"By . Daily Mail . According to the latest collection of national security details leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, the National Security Agency impersonated Facebook in an attempt to trick users into downloading malicious code in its attempt to install malware on 'millions' of computers. The intelligence agency reportedly deployed malware code tailored to target specific machines. Once inside, the code gives the NSA total control of the computer. The NSA dubbed the Facebook trick QUANTUMHAND. Scroll down for video . Spies: The NSA used Facebook in its efforts to install malware on computers as part of its 'Owning the Net' program . The program was first reported by Glenn Greenwald at The Intercept. 'In some cases the NSA has masqueraded as a fake Facebook server, using . the social media site as a launching pad to infect a target’s computer . and exfiltrate files from a hard drive,' Greenwald reports, based on classified documents given to him by Snowden. '[The NSA] has sent out spam emails laced with the malware, which can be tailored to covertly record audio from a computer’s microphone and take snapshots with its webcam,' Greenwald reports. 'The hacking systems have also enabled the NSA to launch cyberattacks by corrupting and disrupting file downloads or denying access to websites.' The program initially was tested on 'about a dozen targets' before it became more widely used in 2010, according to the report. Masquerade: The NSA posed as a Facebook server to gain access to private computers . The program was started as a way to hit about 100 to 150 'hard-to-reach' targets. However, the malware has since spread to potentially millions of computers across the world. The malware was potentially able to infect so many computers by using an automated system the NSA calls TURBINE. TURBINE gave NSA agents the ability to access - or even destroy - computers on a 'massive scale,' Fox News reports. 'One implant, codenamed UNITEDRAKE, can be used with a variety of “plug-ins” that enable the agency to gain total control of an infected computer,' Greenwald reports.'An implant plug-in named CAPTIVATEDAUDIENCE, for example, is used to take over a targeted computer’s microphone and record conversations taking place near the device.

The airport was thrown into meltdown by a power cut on Christmas Eve, with more than 100 flights either cancelled or hugely delayed.

After most passengers had moved on, these two continued to wait for the departure of their flight yesterday . John Mann, Labour chairman of the Treasury select committee, said: ‘It seems that this company has under-invested in contingency planning – despite raking in hundreds of millions of pounds of profits and ruining Christmas for hundreds of people. ‘It seems like they have been caught unprepared – and this is at a time when they are arguing for expansion. ‘What’s the point in expanding if they can’t cope with what they’ve already got? Some of these problems were entirely avoidable.’ Graham Stringer, a Labour member of . the Commons transport select committee, said: ‘What this shows is that . we need a lot more resilience in the system. We also need the company . behind Gatwick to put some of the profits back into making sure that . they can cope with unexpected weather events like this.’ The .

We will certainly look at those issues.’ But he stressed that it was the airlines who had a duty to look after their passengers in such a crisis. One senior airline executive, whose flights were badly hit, said: ‘Questions have got to be asked about Gatwick’s resilience to flooding.

"By . Lizzie Parry . An easyJet flight was grounded for two hours after a security alert was sparked when schoolchildren reported seeing a man writing Arabic in a notebook. The students, who were aged 15 and 16, alerted cabin crew after spotting the man writing in what appeared to be Arabic script, while waiting for take off. The flight from Amsterdam to Newcastle was delayed to allow for 16 of the 45-strong group of students, believed to be from a school in Northumberland, to get off the aircraft. Delayed: An easyJet flight from Amsterdam to Newcastle was delayed for two hours after a group of school children reported seeing another passenger writing in what appeared to be Arabic script . Technical support worker Adam Robson, 21, who was sat next to the man, said he first became aware of the issue when he felt kicking and banging on the back of his seat as one of the student's suffered a panic attack. He said: 'The guy had a notebook and people were looking over at it as it had both Arabic writing and English words. 'One of the students called a flight attendant over and pointed it out,' said Mr Robson, from Newcastle’s West End, who had been on a romantic weekend away with his girlfriend Lauren. 'She went away, but just as we were about to take off there was a kicking and banging on my seat from behind us and the student was having a panic attack. 'He went from the window seat into the aisle and ran to the back of the plane. 'The next think we know the pilot has come on and said for safety reasons we were going back to the terminal.' Mr Robson said he and other passengers were kept aboard the aircraft as a number of the pupils and their luggage were taken off the aircraft - as temperatures in the cabin soared to 30 degrees. 'The attendants had to bring us cups of cold water because it was so hot,' he said. Genuine: Passenger Adam Robson, who was sitting next to the man on the flight which took off from Amsterdam's Schiphol airport, said he 'was harmless'. He said the man was an Iranian masters student at Teesside University and had been in Amsterdam visiting his wife . The flight, on Monday, eventually took off, with Mr Robson chatting to the man, who he said seemed 'completely harmless'. 'It turns out he was an Iranian masters student at Teesside University and the reason he was in Amsterdam was because his wife was studying there as she’d been unable to transfer to a North East university. 'He makes the trips regularly and he said he always carries his notebook, which he showed me. It had some Arabic, but the further through you went the more English it had as he had written down sections of newspapers and was using it to teach himself more of the language. 'He was really genuine. 'Thankfully he wasn’t aware of it and he didn’t understand what was going on.' On arriving back in Newcastle Adam said he helped the man, whose name he did not know, make his way to Central Station so he could catch a train back to his home in Middlesbrough. The pupils who got off the flight returned on another easyJet flight which landed at Stansted yesterday. An easyJet spokesman said: 'easyJet can confirm that flight EZY6554 from Amsterdam to Newcastle was delayed while a number of passengers from a school group chose to move onto an alternative flight. 'This was due to a nervous young passenger in the group who raised a security issue prior to take off. The Captain fully assessed the issue and the flight was cleared for take off by easyJet’s security department. 'The safety and wellbeing of our passengers is always easyJet’s priority. 'The flight was delayed by two hours 20 minutes while the issue was investigated and to enable 16 members of the group to be offloaded along with their baggage. 'easyJet transferred the passengers onto an alternative flight of charge free of charge.

"By . Chris Pleasance . Russia has no plans to invade Ukraine but the Kremlin will respect the result of the upcoming referendum in Ukraine's Crimea region, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said. Speaking after several hours of talks in London with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, Lavrov there was still no common vision with the West over Ukraine and that Russia needed no international structure to help it mediate with Kiev. Kerry also revealed that Russian President Vladimir Putin will make no decision about the future of Ukraine until after the referendum on Crimea's future. Scroll down for video . Sergey Lavrov said Russia has no plans to attack Ukraine after talks with US Secretary of State John Kerry in Downing Street today but said the two countries share 'no common vision' on the crisis . Kerry confirmed Russia will not make a decision on Ukraine's future until after a referendum on Sunday when Crimean citizens are expected to back becoming part of Russia . Kerry said he had raised concerns over troop movements during six hours of talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in London aimed at reducing tensions ahead of the vote in Crimea on March 16. 'Neither we nor the international community will recognise the results of this referendum and we also remain deeply concerned about the large deployments of Russian forces in Crimea and along the eastern border,' he added. 'Right now, given this particular climate, we really need to hear more declarative policy in order to make clear where Russia is proceeding with respect to these troops and these exercises.' Kerry said the Kremlin's next steps would depend on a final decision that Russian President Vladimir Putin would take after the referendum. 'The Foreign Minister made it clear that President Putin is not prepared to make any decision regarding Ukraine until after the referendum on Sunday,' Kerry said. 'We believe the referendum is contrary to the constitution of Ukraine, contrary to international law, is in violation of that law, and is illegitimate,' he said. The news comes as Ukrainian troops . prepared for a possible attack by Russian forces by carrying out drills . and firing rocket launchers near the capital. The moves were in response to fears that the Kremlin could move its military deeper into Ukraine after a pro-Russian protester was killed overnight in Donetsk. Officials said that Russia would uphold its right to defend all its citizens in the country. Kerry, pictured with Lavrov on the lawn of the US ambassador's residence, London, has said America will reject the result of any referendum . Lavrov said the talks were 'useful' but refused to say how Russia will act until after the Crimean referendum . So far Russian troops have only occupied key parts of the Crimea region, where they have a naval base, but Donetsk is 400 miles to the east. Speaking to reporters after a talks with US Secretary of State in London today, Mr Lavrov said: 'We will respect the expression of the will of the Crimean people in in the upcoming referendum. 'The Russian Federation does not and cannot have any plans to invade the southeastern regions of Ukraine.' Sunday's vote on Crimea - Ukraine's strategic Black Sea peninsula of 2 million people - is widely expected to back secession and, potentially, annexation with Russia. The new government in Kiev believes the vote is illegal, but Moscow says it does not recognize the new government as legitimate. The U.S. and EU say the Crimean vote violates Ukraine's constitution and international law. If Crimea votes to secede, the U.S. and European Union plan to slap sanctions as early as Monday on Russian officials and businesses accused of escalating the crisis and undermining Ukraine's new government. Lavrov on Friday reaffirmed that Russia will 'respect the results of the referendum' in Crimea and said sanctions would harm relations. 'Our partners also realize that sanctions are counterproductive,' he said. European and U.S. leaders have repeatedly urged Moscow to pull back its troops in Crimea and stop encouraging local militias there who are hyping the vote as a choice between re-establishing generations of ties with Russia or returning to echoes of fascism from Ukraine's World War II era, when some residents cooperated with Nazi occupiers. Earlier today it was revealed that the EU has drawn up a list of 120 Russian military figures it will hit with asset freezes and visa restrictions if US-led sanctions go ahead. Near the Ukranian capital of Kiev soldiers loyal to the new government took part in military drills today . The practice drills took place as the Kremlin said it would protect its citizens across Ukraine following the death of a pro-Russian protestor overnight in Donetsk . The five-page list was drawn up by diplomats with experience in Russia and was supplied to EU officials in Brussels, who will discuss the names and whittle the list down ahead of a foreign ministers' meeting on Monday. The list represents the first concrete action against Russia by Europe, who until now have been more hesitant to issue sanctions compared with America, in part because of Russian investment in Europe. Speaking before the talks, John Kerry said he hoped the discussions would come up with a solution to 'resolve some of the differences between us' as he welcomed Lavrov to the US Ambassador's residence in Regent's Park. However, Lavrov appeared to dash those hopes by saying there was 'no common vision' between the two countries, although he added the discussion had been 'useful'. So far Russian forces have only occupied positions in Crimea, where the country has a naval base . The city of Donetsk, where the activist was stabbed to death, is 400 miles to the east of Crimea . As the country slips towards conflict, Lavrov insisted that talks with John Kerry had been 'useful' Politicians and officials in Moscow could be hit with asset freezes and travel bans if a referendum goes ahead in Crimea on Sunday over whether to break away from Ukraine in favour of joining the Russian Federation. Mr Kerry said: 'Obviously we have a lot to talk about and look forward to an opportunity to dig in to the issues and possibilities that we may be able to find about how to move forward together to resolve some of the differences between us. 'We look forward, I know, to a good conversation.' As politicians in Crimea seek closer ties with Russia, revolutionaries in Kiev want a better relationship with the European Union. A small group of Ukrainian protesters . with posters reading 'NATO Save Ukraine' awaited Kerry as he arrived at . Downing Street for a meeting with Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron . and Foreign Secretary William Hague ahead of his talks with Lavrov. Cameron . underlined the threat of sanctions when he sat down with Kerry, telling . him that 'we want to see progress as much as you do.' Before meeting with Mr Lavrov, Mr Kerry spoke with David Cameron and William Hague as it was revealed the EU has drawn up a list of 120 Russians to potentially be hit with sanctions . The talks take place as yet more troops and vehicles have been landed in Crimea, it has been reported . 'We . want to see Ukrainians and the Russians talking to each other. And if . they don't then there are going to have to be consequences,' he added. Kerry thanked his British hosts for their strong position, saying that 'we're all hoping that we don't get pushed into a place where we have to do all this. But we'll see what happens.' However as military tensions increase, a diplomatic solution to the crisis looks increasingly unlikely. Today Serbian paramilitaries wearing a black flag with a skull on their sleeves were helping Russian soldiers check traffic along the busy road linking the regional capital of Simferopol and the naval port of Sevastopol. Bratislav Zivkovic, one of the commanders of Serbia's Chetnik movement, an ultranationalist force, said it was only natural for them to come to Crimea to help their Russian brethren. Earlier this morning soldiers and an armoured vehicle were spotted landing on the peninsula from Russian boat Yamal 156, which is capable of carrying over 300 troops and up to a dozen vehicles. Kerry and Lavrov have spoken almost daily as the Ukraine crisis has unfolded but have yet to find any common ground. Ultranationalist Serbian paramilitaries have been spotted completing traffic stops alongside Russian soldiers in Crimea in scenes reminiscent of the Balkans in the 1990s . Kerry has warned Russian against deliberately provoking anti-European sentiment in Crimea, as the upcoming referendum is being presented as a choice between historic Russian ties and European fascism . At the Senate hearing, Kerry said Moscow should expect the U.S. and European Union to take measures against it on Monday if Russia accepts and acts on a decision by Crimea to secede from Ukraine. The U.S. and EU say the vote Sunday violates Ukraine's constitution and international law. Russia has said it will respect the results of the referendum. In another show of support for Ukraine's sovereignty, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden met with Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk on Thursday, a day after the new prime minister met with President Barack Obama. The White House said Biden told Yatsenyuk that the U.S. 'stands firmly behind Ukraine and the Ukrainian people in ensuring Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.' Obama has imposed limited sanctions against unidentified Russian officials thought by the U.S. to be directly involved in destabilizing Ukraine. But Congress on Thursday put off a vote that would have expanded those sanctions, as well as approving $1billion in loan guarantees to Ukraine and International Monetary Fund revisions to help Kiev. The Senate won't vote on the measure until March 24 at the earliest, when lawmakers return from a week-long recess, while House Republicans are pushing their own Ukraine aid bill that includes no Russia sanctions or IMF provisions. Sen. John McCain sharply criticized fellow Republicans for not acting 'when the people of Ukraine are crying out for our help.'","John Kerry has met Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in Downing Street .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . Florida Planned Parenthood lobbyist Alisa LaPolt Snow testified against a 'Born Alive' infant protection bill that would give human rights to babies born after a botched abortion. She said doctors in abortion clinics should not be required to take such babies to a hospital, instead leaving the 'choice' of what to do up to them and their patients . In a hearing Tuesday before the Florida House of Representatives' Civil Justice Committee, state legislators were dumbfounded as Planned Parenthood lobbyist argued that pregnant women and health care providers should be permitted to terminate the lives of babies who are born alive after botched abortions. Alisa LaPolt Snow, a former Associated Press and Gannett News Service reporter who now lobbies for the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates, argued against legislation giving babies who survived abortion attempts the same legal rights and protections as other children. H.B. 1129, the Infants Born Alive Act, Snow said, 'inserts politics where it doesn't belong' and 'attempts to interfere with a woman's ability to make her own personal medical decisions.' The bill was introduced by State Rep. Cary Pigman, a board certified Emergency Medicine physician. It has nine co-sponsors. 'It is just really hard for me to even ask you this question,' Republican State Rep. Jim Boyd said during the hearing, 'because I’m almost in disbelief: If a baby is born on a table as a result of a botched abortion, what would Planned Parenthood want to have happen to that child that's struggling for life?' Snow replied, 'We believe that, you know, any decision that's made should be left up to the woman, her family, and the physician.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . This November 2005 Daily Mail front page told the news that 50 babies live through botched terminations in Britain ever year. Annual March For Life demonstrations in the US are met every year by smaller numbers of pro-abortion demonstrators like this one who marched in 2013 in San Francisco. The 2013 protests marked the 40th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision that legalized the practice of terminating pregnancies . Florida Republican State Rep. Daniel Davis (L) was shocked that Planned Parenthood doctors 'do something other than resuscitate and save' a baby born alive after a botched abortion. When a Planned Parenthood lobbyist said the decision should be left up to patients and doctors, Rep. Jose Oliva (R) insisted that the 'patient' doctors should be most concerned about is 'the child struggling on a table' She restated the same answer in response to a question from State Rep. Jose Oliva, another Republican. 'That decision should be between the patient and the health care provider,' she insisted. 'I think that at that point,' Oliva countered, 'the patient would be the child struggling on a table. Wouldn't you agree?' Snow seemed to concede the point. 'That's a very good question,' she said. 'I really don't know how to answer that.' The Weekly Standard first published video of the proceedings online on its political blog. Next in the line of emotional inquisitors was Republican Rep. Daniel Davis. 'What happens in a situation where a baby is alive, breathing on a table, moving,' Davis asked. 'What do your physicians do at that point?' 'I do not have that information,' Snow replied. 'I am not a physician, I am not an abortion provider. So I do not have that information.' The Florida Association of Planned Parenthood Affiliates is the state public policy office representing Florida¿s five affiliated organizations and their 24 abortion clinics. A lobbyist hired by the group argued against a legislative proposal to protect the lives of babies born despite their mothers' attempted abortions . Davis pressed her. 'I understand that you're not a physician but you do represent physicians who do perform this activity,' he said. 'Can you tell me what happens when a baby is alive on the table? At that point, what do they do with the baby that is struggling to live?' 'I don't know,' Snow responded, adding that 'we don't know even how prevalent this situation is.' Daniel Davis framed the debate in stark terms. 'What you're saying if you oppose it is, you have a living baby, struggling to survive, and you do something other - I don't even want to talk about what you do - but you do something other than resuscitate and save the baby.' Two committee Democrats joined Republicans in defending the legislation. Rep. José Javier Rodríguez insisted that the measure was not politically motivated, and would not hijack medical decisions from trained physicians. 'This bill really has been about protecting medically needy infants from potential situations of neglect,' Rodriguez said. Responding to opposition to the Babies Born Alive Protection Act, Florida Rep. Mike Clelland said, 'I've been pro-choice my whole life, and I can't think of a more sensible bill in this regard' Rep. Mike Clelland, another Democratic legislator, remarked that 'I've been pro-choice my whole life, and I can't think of a more sensible bill in this regard.' 'Does Planned Parenthood have an objection,' Clelland asked Snow rhetorically, 'to a doctor being obligated to provide advanced life support in an abortion clinic setting to a child born alive?' 'I mean, I guess you do or you wouldn't be here, right?' Clelland also asked how Planned Parenthood could take issue with requiring a doctor 'to transport a child born alive to a hospital where it seems to me they would be most likely to be able to survive.' Citing 'logistical issues,' Snow said her organization was concerned about 'situations where it is in a rural health care setting, the hospital is 45 minutes or an hour away, and it's the closest trauma center or emergency room.' When his turn came to debate the measure, Boyd asked, 'Who cares if it's a rural health clinic?' Lawmakers, he said, must 'intervene if we have to, to make sure that the struggling child survives.' 'I can't imagine that we're having this conversation,' Boyd added. People participate in the annual March for Life rally on the National Mall in Washington, DC in January 2013. The anti-abortion marchers marked the 40th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade U.S. Supreme Court ruling legalizing abortion, and then-Pope Benedict expressed support for the demonstrators . Digesting graphic testimony about the fate of unwanted children who manage to survive an abortion, Republican Rep. Ross Spano said the experience 'makes me sick to my stomach, frankly.' 'Who we are and what we do with our children is so absolutely fundamental to what we are as a community and as a state and as a civilization,' Spano said. 'And if we can't take a stand to protect the most vulnerable, God forbid who we are and where we're headed.' 'This bill has nothing to do with women and choice and anything else,' Oliva added. 'It has to do with that child that is born.'","Planned Parenthood rep: Decision about whether to save a baby born alive 'should be between the patient and the health care provider'

"By . Ryan Gorman . A popular California high school cheerleader died only months after being diagnosed with lung cancer. Sandra Martinez, a 16-year-old junior at Azusa High School, passed away March 6 when her family took her off a life support machine. The problems started in January when she complained to her mother of shortness of breath while cheering during a January basketball game, according to KABC. Tragic: Sandra Martinez died only 16-years-old after succumbing to lung cancer . A bright future: Martinez was an honor roll student . The concerned mother immediately took her to a local hospital where the honor roll student found out she had a seven-inch cancerous tumor on her lungs. She died last week only two months later. ‘She was surrounded by family and went peacefully. Our family would like to thank everyone for their prayers and support as well as ask for privacy during this time,’ her family posted to Facebook. Her death came just over one month after she was sedated to stem her suffering from complications of the aggressive tumor, according to the San Gabriel Valley Tribune. One of the teen’s lungs collapsed due to internal bleeding from an attempted biopsy, according to KABC. Martinez’s passing also came only days before her school was set to hold a benefit to help her family pay for the mounting medical bills. ‘My heartaches so much. God you have taken another beautiful cousin of ours,’ a family member wrote on Facebook. She never had a chance: Martinez died only two months after being told she had a seven-inch tumor on her lungs . Beloved: Martinez was a well-liked and popular student at Azusa High School . ‘I can't begin to express the sorrow in my heart for your, our, loss. My condolences,’ another person wrote. The popular student held a 4.5 grade point average and was well-liked among her peers, according to Principal Ramiro Rubalcaba. ‘We are all going to feel her loss,’ Rubalcaba told the Tribune. ‘She will be in our hearts forever.’ An online fundraising drive raised more than $11,000 to help Martinez’s family pay her medical bills, but that still won’t bring her back. ‘My dear Sandra there are no words to express the heart ache of losing you,’ another relative wrote on Facebook. ‘Although we may be comforted with the fact that you are now at rest peacefully, we will always miss you.’","Sandra Martinez, 16, was told in January she had a seven-inch tumor on her lungs .

"By . Mail Online Reporter . The Rolling Stones may be the most famous group of ageing rockers, but they have nothing on this group of ageing rocks which are to be played in Paris for the first time. The ancient lithophone, a collection of two dozen tuned rocks which are played much like a modern-day xylophone, are to be chimed again thousands of years after they were first used. But after just three shows, two next Saturday and a third the following Monday, the precious stones will be packed away again for good. An ancient lithophone, which dates back thousands of years, is to be played in Paris during three concerts . Lithophone expert Erik Gonthier is helping oversee the concerts before the stones are packed away for good . Prehistorian Odile Romain, alongside paleomusicologist and lithophone specialist Erik Gonthier, are overseeing the project. Lithophones, a word which comes from litho, meaning rock, and phone, meaning sound, were common instruments in ancient times and have been discovered in more than 50 countries. The oldest, which date back around 4,000 years, were found in Vietnam by French ethnologist Georges Condominas in 1949. Lithophones, which are still used as percussion instruments to this day, are usually carved out of large pieces of rock. Lithophones were common musical instruments in ancient times, with tuned rocks found in 50 countries around the world, and the oldest discovered in Vietnam . However there are several examples of 'living' lithophones around the world, made from naturally occurring stalactites and stalagmites. Mfangano Island, in Lake Victoria, Kenya, the Great Stalacpipe Organ of Luray Caverns, Virginia, Tenkasi in South India and Ringing Rocks Park in Pennsylvania all contain lithophones made from natural rock formations. There is a working lithophone in the UK, located in the Keswick Museum, Joseph Richardson’s Rock Harmonicon was built in the late nineteenth century using slate and can still be played by visitors.","Ancient lithophone to be played in series of Paris concerts .

"By . Alex Greig . A Minnesota woman whose lifelong dream is to finish the Boston Marathon is planning to run the race this year, despite being given a terminal cancer diagnosis. Elinor Scott, 50, came close last year but never got to the finish line because of the two bombs that went off, causing three deaths and hundreds of injuries. Now she's refusing to let a diagnosis of stage four pancreatic cancer rob her of her dream of finishing the marathon and plans to finish what she came so close to accomplishing last year. Racing against time: Elinor Scott (pictured with her daughter Martha) plans to run the Boston Marathon this year, despite a stage four cancer diagnosis . Life goal: Scott's dream is to finish the Boston Marathon . Scott began running five years ago after a series of health problems and quickly became addicted. 'It’s provided me community, health, happiness, all the things you get from something like church,' Scott told CBS. After she began running, she set a goal: completing the Boston Marathon. Last year, the mother of four was about three-quarters of a mile from the finish line when two bombs went off, leaving death and destruction in their wake. Determined: Even if she can only 'run slow,' Scott just wants to cross the finish line . Running religion: Scott (pictured with her running partner) began running five years ago and fell in love with it . Scott was horrified for the victims of the blasts, but also crestfallen that the bombings had robbed her of her dream. 'I was disappointed on a personal level, because I didn't know if I would have it in me to qualify again,' Scott said. She has been too weak to train, but Scott's goal remains, even if she's now also racing against time. 'They tell you what they’re going to tell you about stage IV cancer. They don’t really offer you any promises,' she said. Proud: Scott's daughter Martha (left) is planning to be in Boston to watch her mother run in the marathon . 'Right now I’m just very focused on seeing what kind of life, any life, I can have on the other side of this journey. Because I just want to live. If I can run slow, that will be fine with me.' Scott's family are with her every step of the way. 'I’m very proud of my mom through everything she’s been through, everything she’s overcome,' said her daughter Martha Sutter. She was some 20 yards from the blast last April and is a big part of my story.  She is an angel among humans.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Associated  Press Reporter . A Florida man convicted of attempted murder in a confrontation over loud music won't be sentenced until after his retrial on a murder charge. Jurors deadlocked last month on the . first-degree murder charge against Michael Dunn, 47, in the shooting of 17-year-old Jordan Davis . outside a Jacksonville convenience store in November 2012. Prosecutors said they would . retry him, with a judge Friday ruling Dunn's new trial will commence on May 5. Dunn had been scheduled this month to be sentenced for attempted murder and firing into a vehicle, but his attorney was concerned that statements Dunn makes at a sentencing hearing could be used against him in his second trial. Delay: Michael Dunn (right), convicted of attempted murder in a confrontation over loud music, won't be sentenced until after his retrial on a murder charge . Dunn could face a maximum of 60 years in prison for the charges on which he already has been convicted. Last month, Dunn was convicted of lesser counts . after the jury failed to come to an agreement on a first-degree murder . charge against him. After . 30 hours of deliberations, he was found guilty . of three counts of second-degree attempted murder while a mistrial was . declared on the most serious count. The 12 jurors also found Dunn guilty of one count of shooting into an occupied car. Dunn showed no emotion as the verdicts were read. Davis' parents each left the courtroom in tears. 'He's in disbelief, and it has not sunk in,' Dunn's attorney, Cory Strolla, told reporters following the verdict. Victim: Jordan Davis, 17, was shot and killed in November 2012 at a Jacksonville gas station . Strolla also said that Dunn's elderly . parents were 'devastated' by the outcome of the trial, adding, 'I have . no earthly clue what I could have done differently.' The attorney said he planned to file an appeal on behalf of his client. Earlier . in the day, jurors said in a note to Judge Russell L. Healey that they . were having trouble reaching agreement on the murder charge. He asked . them to continue their work, and they went back to the deliberation room . for two more hours. 'I've . never seen a case where deliberations have gone on for this length of . time ...' Healey said after the verdict. 'They've embraced their civic . duty and they are to be commended for that.' During the trial, prosecutor Erin Wolfson told jurors . that Dunn's 'blood started to boil' because of the vehicle-rattling . 'thug music' coming from the SUV. Dunn claimed the . music, which he described as 'rap c**p', was so loud it hurt his ears . and caused his car to vibrate. Dunn . claimed he acted in self-defense, testifying he thought he saw a . firearm pointed at him from the SUV as Davis yelled insults at him and . the argument escalated. No weapon was found in the SUV. Dunn . told jurors he feared for his life, perceiving 'this was a clear and . present danger.'  Dunn, who has a concealed weapons permit, fired 10 . shots, hitting the vehicle nine times. Prosecutors . contended that Dunn opened fire because he felt disrespected by Davis. Dunn . escalated the confrontation and fired in premeditated fashion because a . teenager had disrespected him, the prosecutor said. She . said: 'This defendant was disrespected by a 17-year-old teenager, and . he lost it. He wasn't happy with Jordan Davis' attitude. What was his . response? ''You're not going to talk to me like that.'"" 'He took these actions because it was premeditated. It was not self-defense.' However, Dunn's . attorney argued that his client used legitimate self-defense after . Davis let forth with an expletive-laced threat and rebuffed the . prosecution's claim that Dunn was 'a madman with a gun'. The teen made his friend turn the hip hop music back up after they initially . turned it down at Dunn's request. Dunn was parked in the spot next to . the SUV outside the convenience store. Stunned: Michael Dunn (L) raises his hands in disbelief as he looks at his parents after the verdicts were announced in his trial on Saturday night . Reaction: Dunn's attorney said his client was in disbelief over the verdict, which he plans to appeal . 'That . defendant didn't shoot into a carful of kids to save his life. He shot . into it to save his pride,' Assistant State Attorney John Guy told the . jury earlier in the week. 'Jordan Davis didn't have a weapon, he had a . big mouth.' The trial was . the latest Florida case to raise questions about self-defense and race, . coming six months after George Zimmerman was acquitted in the shooting . of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Sanford, about 125 miles south of . Jacksonville. The Dunn trial was prosecuted by the same State Attorney's . Office that handled the Zimmerman case.

McBath (C) leaves the courtroom with her husband Curtis McBath (R) as . court recessed for the jury to reconsider the first charge against . Michael Dunn in Jacksonville, Florida . Dunn's . attorney told reporters before the verdict that he . believed there was political pressure on the prosecutors and an excess . of media attention because of Zimmerman's acquittal. 'I . believe there is a lot vested in this case, politically,' Strolla said. 'The case, on the heels of not guilty in George Zimmerman, just . escalated that political pressure.'

The body of Carl Yerger, 45, from Fleetwood, was discovered in the town of Bimini on the western side of the archipelago early Friday morning. According to the victim's wife, Rebecca Snyder Yerger, her husband was a co-owner of Custom Milling and Consulting. Victim: Carl Yerger, 45, from Fleetwood, Pennsylvania, was on a business trip to the Bahamas when he was stabbed to death just outside his resort . Murder in paradise: Yerger's body was discovered outside the Big Game Resort and Marina in Bimini, Bahamas . The father of two young sons, ages 7 and 10, was also a president of the Oley Valley Youth Sports League for just over a year. According to the Royal Bahamas Police Force, Mr Yerger was found dead from multiple stab wounds at around 7am outside the Big Game Resort and Marina, where he was staying for the duration of the business trip, NBC 10 reported. Investigators say they have taken in four suspects for questioning, but no charges have been filed so far. Police believe that the fatal stabbing may have been a random act of violence. Bahamas Press reported . that Mr Yerger may have been familiar with his killer, and that the . stabbing could be related to a large-scale drug sting that took place in . the vicinity of the resort just hours after Yerger was found dead. The . paper reported that the son of the island's mail boat captain was . arrested by Bimini police, who also seized 500lbs of illegal drugs. Family man: Mr Yerger leaves behind his wife, Rebecca (far left) and the couple's two sons, ages 7 and 10 (pictured center) In a statement released on the Oley Valley Youth League website, Mr Yerger was described as a  'forward thinking, intelligent and thoughtful' leader who volunteered countless hours to the program. ‘He was unique, caring, ambitious, detailed, organized, courageous, a problem solver, and mediator,’ the tribute read. ‘He was patient and a great man that led with his words and more importantly with his actions. He led with class and a smile.’ The youth sports league, a non-profit organization that offers coaching in baseball, softball, basketball, field hockey and soccer, has suspended all its games this weekend in light of Yerger's tragic death, according to WFMZ. Role model: Mr Yerger had served as the president of the Oley Valley Youth Sports League, where he distinguished himself as a forward-thinking leader with a talent for organization .

They're the latest in a rolling series of documents to be released by National Archives and the Clinton Presidential Library, which are expected to total more than 30,000 pages this year. But the most recent insights into the Bill Clinton White House may just be the most entertaining. The documents - which have previously been exempted from disclosure requirements because they involve appointments to federal office and confidential advice to the former President - feature jokes Clinton had drafted into speeches but decided not to say when came time to deliver. Of particular amusement are some references to his former Vice President, Al Gore, and independent rival, Ross Perot, according to CBS News. Barrel of laughs: New documents released by National Archives and the Clinton Presidential Library have revealed untold jokes that were drafted into speeches by Bill Clinton during his presidency. The disclosure exemptions of the documents expired in 2013, 12 years after Clinton's run as president. The National Archives notified representatives of Clinton and President Obama of its intent to disclose the records. Lawyers have been reviewing the records to determine if new exemptions should apply. 'Some of my friends in Hollywood have started working on Home Alone 3. But their negotiations broke down with Macaulay Culkin. So, now, they're asking for George. I figure, why not? With a little make-up he might look old enough for the part.' - Joke about Clinton advisor George Stephanopoulos . One of the best of the 'untold jokes' of former US President Bill Clinton (L) refers to his former Vice President Al Gore (R) 'Did you see Ross Perot on TV last Sunday? .... You're in a minority. Boy, I never thought I'd say that to this crowd.''Ross Perot says Federal employees get all these special privileges... like free rides on the subway. Heck, everyone knows all Federal workers use chauffeured limousines.''I've got to hand it to Ross, though. A guy with BILLIONS, asking people to send him 15 dollars each. It's not a bad investment. You get this really neat decoder ring.' 'I know you've been hearing that there are some unorthodox goings-on in the Oval Office. You've heard... that I let photographer Annie Liebowitz bring in a boom box to play rock and roll full blast.. that an Elvis impersonator came in and sang 'All Shook Up'... that Paul Begala came this close to showing a room full of people his jockeys. I want to set the record straight. They were boxer shorts, Fruit of the Loom.' - Jokes removed from Clinton's remarks at the 1993 Gridiron Dinner . Butt of many jokes: Ross Perot was an independent U.S. presidential candidate who ran against Bill Clinton . 'Sometimes journalists get too carried . away pronouncing judgments ... Just listen to what the press is saying . about that cult leader in Texas: 'crazed for attention' ... 'driven by a . messianic complex' ...

The fuzz were on the scene because Robert Gross’ nephew Carl Gross Jr called 911 to warn his father was dangerous, according to WFMZ. Robert Gross drove his brother to the shopping center to visit his granddaughter at the Cost Cutters hair salon, he claims in the suit. Police approached the two men in the parking lot, screamed and threw him to the ground before shooting him with the Taser guns, the suit claims. When Robert Gross asked why he was be brutalized by the officers, they replied ‘you know.’ The cops then tossed him in a squad car and placed him under arrest. The mix-up was only cleared up during a later court date, but the damage was already done. Robert Gross claims he suffered chest pains so bad he felt he might not survive. Where it happened: Allentown police are accused of attacking Robert Gross in front of this Cost Cutters hair salon in a Walmart shopping center . Shocked: The cops shot Robert gross six times with a Taser gun similar to this one, he claims in a lawsuit . Police charged Robert Gross with resisting arrest and disorderly conduct. ‘We argued that the cops mistook him (Robert) for his brother and tried to take him into custody,’ Attorney Kathryn Roberts told the Philadelphia Enquirer. ‘They didn’t dispute that they Tasered him. They didn’t dispute that he got slammed face down to the ground.’ Police insisted during the trial that Robert Gross ‘was argumentative and belligerent and trying to punch them,’ Roberts recalled, adding that he disputed their version of events. The elderly man was found guilty of disorderly conduct, a violation. He is seeking $50,000 in damages as well as interest and other costs.","Robert Gross, now 77-years-old, was shot half a dozen times by cops armed with Taser guns, he claims in a lawsuit .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A former U.S. soldier who shot dead an Iraqi prisoner after forcing him to strip naked during an unauthorized interrogation has been released from prison on parole. After serving five years for the 2008 killing of Ali Mansur, former U.S. Army 1st Lt. Michael Behenna emerged from the U.S. Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth to the cheers of his family on Friday. His relatives, who never gave up hope of his early release, drew him into a group prayer and held him tight. 'This is such a surreal feeling,' Behenna, dressed in an orange hoodie and gray sweat pants, told The Oklahoman. 'The only thing I’ve seen for the past five years is concrete, a little bit of grass, fence and razor wire.

The ex-soldier had served five years of a 15-year sentence for his 2009 conviction on a charge of unpremeditated murder in a combat zone when he was released on Friday. On May 16, 2008, just a few weeks after an improvised bomb attack killed two members of Behenna’s seven-man platoon in Iraq, Behenna killed known al-Qaida operative Ali Mansur while questioning him. There was no dispute that Behenna was . supposed to take the Iraqi prisoner home.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A New Jersey soccer mom sentenced to 10 years in federal prison for trying to hire a hit man to kill her ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend has spoken for the first time about what drove her to the murder-the-hire plot. She has even apologized to the victim for trying to have her murdered. Nicole Faccenda, 45, of Lyndhurst, N.J., is in prison in West Virginia after being caught in an undercover police sting in 2011, ABC News reported. Faccenda was introduced to a man she thought was a killer in the parking lot of a Mahwah, N.J., supermarket, however the man was an undercover officer with the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives -- the ATF. Scroll down for video . Apologized: Nicole Faccenda, 45, of New Jersey, has public said sorry to the woman she tried to have murdered, after being caught in an undercover sting in 2011 . While all there meetings were being secretly recorded, Faccenda was suspicious the man may have been agent, refusing to explicitly say she wanted the woman dead, saying she has 'watched too many Lifetime movies'. She used turns of phrase like she 'wants to be dressed in black', referring to a funeral, and wanted the new girlfriend 'gone to the moon'. However after a few phone conversations Faccenda inevitably let her guard down, and she soon handed over a $2,000 down payment with the promise of another $18,000 when the woman was dead and she could go to her funeral and 'p--- on her grave'. She also provided a picture of the intended target, along with her address. As for her ex-boyfriend, she said she didn't want him killed, but it would be all right for the hit man to shoot him in the foot. She had less concern for the other woman's children. If they got in the way, she said: 'Oh well, I'm sorry.' Faccenda was arrested after the week-long ATF operation. Stung: This is the moment Nicole Faccenda first met with whom she believed to be a hit man, in the carpark of a supermarket in Manwah.

Suspcious: This footage, taken inside the car by an undercover cop, shows Nicole Faccenda looking directly at the camera that was secretly filming her. She also refused to discuss the murder-for-hire explicity, saying: 'I want to wear black.' She later pleaded guilty and, in December 2013, was sentenced to 10 years in prison. She has now decided to talk openly about her crime and sent a series of emails to ABC about why she did it. Faccenda hopes that, by speaking out, she may be able to help other women from landing in the same position. 'My message to any woman who has had her heart broken and has felt the pain of loss in every bone in her body ... is to take a deep breath and think before speaking,' she said via email. 'Your words are powerful weapons and you will be held accountable for them and it is definitely not worth it. 'I know in my heart that if it were not for the persistence and constant pressure from the CI (Confidential Informant) and the ATF agents wanting to make their case, I would not be here today.

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor, In Nashua, N.h. Joe Scarborough, the center-right MSNBC personality who served in Congress from 1995 to 2001, is leaving the door open for a 2016 presidential run, but Republicans in the critical primary state of New Hampshire don't seem to care. Wearing a Democrat-friendly blue tie, the 'Morning Joe' host told the Northeast Republican Leadership Conference that he would leave the door open for a return to politics, especially because 'we don't need to elect another Clinton for eight years.' Scarborough entered a Nashua, N.H. hotel to cheers. But after he moderated a panel discussion with four 2012 campaign operatives, GOP activists seemed not to take him seriously. 'Do you think Joe Scarborough is serious about running for office?' MailOnline asked 25 conference attendees. 'Would you consider supporting him if he did?' Scarborough was 0-for-25. Not a single attendee selected at random answered yes to either question. Scarborough entered to cheers but left many N.H. Republicans thinking he's not worth a presidential glance . Serious Joe? Instead of commanding a central speaking slot, Scarborough emceed a panel discussion with campaign operatives from the 2012 presidential primaries . Scarborough's center-right morning show is a bright spot in MSNBC's otherwise lackluster ratings, but he angered conservatives when he came out in favor of gun control proposals . Many Northeast Republican Leadership Conference attendees see Scarborough as an entertaining pundit but dismiss him as a political leader . And the results of a straw poll, announced hours later, must have brought disappointment to Scarborough if he fancies himself a serious candidate. Although WPA Opinion Research announced this week to great fanfare that Scarborough's name would be on the ballot, he won so little support that he was entirely absent from the results. Republicans in Nashua were left to assume that his supporters were lumped into the nebulous 'other' category. The lowest vote totals reported before dinner on Saturday belonged to Sen. Marco Rubio and former UN Ambassador John Bolton, with 3 per cent apiece. New Englanders who spoke with MailOnline seemed to see it coming. 'Are you serious? He's still an entertainer on MSNBC,' replied a man from Manchester, jabbing at the network's much-discussed leftward tilt. Scarborough himself tried to dismiss his affiliation with the network that broadcasts Al Sharpton and Rachel Maddow. 'Yes, I am a conservative,' he said, 'despite the network I work at. And Reverend Al says hello.' The joke earned him only a few titters. 'It's not like I would pick Scarborough over Hillary [Clinton],' a student from Plymouth State University told MailOnline, 'but, come on. I think he's trying to sell books, or maybe he's in a mid-life crisis.' In Nashua, Scarborough signed copies of his November 2013 tome 'The Right Path: From Ike to Reagan, How Republicans Once Mastered Politics – and Can Again' Scarborough is pegging himself as a party unifier with crossover appeal, trying to bridge the ideological gulf between conservatives and more moderate Republicans. But in an era where neither the Mitch McConnell centrists nor the Ted Cruz tea partiers seem eager to compromise, a self-appointed referee is likely to attract scorn from both sides. First in the nation: Republican pols made the trip to Nashua, New Hampshire hoping to build momentum toward the 2016 GOP primary . Scarborough signed books in New Hampshire but didn't go far in winning electoral support among Republican Party activists . Media circus: A day earlier, former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown attracted a crush of national attention by announcing that he would try to return to the Senate as a New Hampshirite . And his switch of allegiances on gun . control following the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary school massacre in . Newtown, Connecticut, won him new fans – on the political left. I had a little talk with him about the Second Amendment,' coastal New Hampshire resident Kimberly Morin told MailOnline. 'It didn't go well for Scarborough.' Scarborough's low-taxes, limited-government messaging has broad appeal, but that won't necessarily convince activists on the right – who largely drive results in early presidential primary states like New Hampshire – to elevate him from background strategist to contender. 'The media loves it' when far-right conservatives stir the pot, he said, 'but crazy never wins.' He rode into Congress following the Republicans' landslide in 1994, joining Newt Gingrich and other conservatives in a 'Contract With America' agenda of privatizing federal agencies and a U.S. withdrawal from the United Nations. His bill shutting down the U.S. Department of Education passed in the House as part of a larger budget resolution, but was ultimately left on the cutting room floor in negotiations with other Republicans in the Senate. But instead of pushing crowd-pleasing ideological positions, or directly taking on President Barack Obama, Scarborough talked tactics. 'We have lost our way over the past several years,' he said. 'You win by knocking on doors.'","'We have lost our way over the past several years,' said the former GOP congressman .
The New Hampshire Republican Party event will include Scarborough in a straw poll of attendees .
After Scarborough spoke, MailOnline polled 25 GOP stalwarts, and none of them said they would seriously consider voting for him .
The lone Republican to host an MSNBC show has been cagey about re-entering politics ."
"By . Daily Mail Reporters . Third suspect: Katherine M. Carpenter, 56, was arrested Saturday . A 56-year-old bank teller who reported finding the body of Aspen socialite Nancy Pfister in a cupboard has been arrested, less than two weeks after the victim's tenants were accused of her murder. Katherine M. Carpenter was charged with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder on Saturday, several weeks after investigators searched her unit at the Christiana Lodge. Carpenter, who had helped manage Pfister's West Buttermilk home and walk her dog, reported finding Pfister's body on February 26. Police began monitoring Carpenter's home on March 2. Carpenter's arrest comes less than two weeks after William Francis Styler III, 65, and his wife, Nancy Christine Styler, 62, were hauled from their Colorado motel room and arrested for allegedly killing Pfister, their landlord, and shoving her in a closet. Just four days before her body was found, Pfister - who had briefly been engaged to Michael Douglas - had returned to Colorado after an extended trip to Australia. Her trip was reportedly cut short because she was having trouble with her tenants, the Stylers. 'I'd like to stay in Australia but the people that were supposedly taking care of my house are not doing what they said they would do and they're not paying rent and they haven't paid utilities,' Pfister, described as a philanthropist, wrote on Facebook on February 3 ahead of her return. On February 6, she posted another message on Facebook seeking a tenant for her home, and stating that Carpenter would assist potential tenants. 'Kathy carpenter from alpine Bank will show anyone interested the ropes, watering greenhouse, Gabe’s stuff,etc. Very easy to contact me via email, thanks in advance!!!' she wrote. Aspen Times reported Carpenter had close ties with Pfister. Carpenter helped take care of Pfister’s eight-month-old Labradoodle, Gabe, and was occasionally seen taking the dog to Aspen Animal Hospital. Pfister also asked friends on Facebook to give Carpenter 'a shout out' on her birthday on February 6. Scroll down for video . [caption . Old life: William Styler, a former physician, and his gardening expert wife Nancy look relaxed as they smile for a photo. The couple have now been accused of murdering a woman in Colorado . Carpenter worked as a bank teller at two Alpine Bank branches - the Aspen Business Center and East Hopkins Avenue. The bank recognized her 20-year service in November. Carpenter has not worked at the bank since reporteing Pfister’s death. According to public records, she kept a post office box in Woody Creek . and had lived in various towns throughout Colorado. She also filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in . 1999, according to federal court records. Two Alpine Bank customer told The Aspen Times that Carpenter was friendly. 'I would have bet the farm that she didn’t do it,' one of the customers said. Meanwhile, the Stylers are expected to be formally charged on Monday, while Carpenter is scheduled to make her first court appearance at 3pm Monday. 'All three inmates are being separated within the jail facility,' the Sheriff’s Office said. New life: The couple are accused of killing an Aspen socialite whose . home they were renting. Records have shown the couple have had money . struggles while William Styler has had health issues . Loss: Nancy Pfister, 57, was found dead last week - four days after she returned from a trip to Australia . Friends of the Stylers say they have been shocked at the arrests. 'They never demonstrated any kind of edge,' Dr. Joel Cooperman, a former neighbor, told the Denver Post. 'Neither of them displayed any kind of behavior that would indicate they would do anything like this.' 'I would laugh to think that that’s what they were involved in. They can't be,' Ned Ingham, a former neighbor, told CBS. 'I am totally floored. It would the last thing I’d ever think.' Dr . Styler, known as Trey, was an anesthesiologist and the chairman of St. Joseph Hospital's Department of Anesthesiology in the 1990s. The couple, who have a son, lived in . the Greenwood Village area until about eight years ago, when Styler was . hit by a chronic illness. He quit his medical practice and his license . expired in 2005. Afterwards, he turned his attentions to helping his wife in her full-time gardening career. She . founded the Victoria Conservancy and provided lilies to gardening . entities around the world, becoming known as a leading expert on the . variety of an 8-foot species called Victoria. They also welcomed school . children into the garden to look at the flowers and their pond. 'They would have people from all over the world over there,' neighbor Ned Ingham said. 'They were known famously for their flowers.' A . photographer, Povy Kendal Atchison, spent time photographing the . Stylers' gardens and the couple for business shots at the time 'things . were going south for them'. Arrest: Styler, a physician, was still in his bathrobe when he was arrested at his Colorado motel room . Caught: The couple were arrested five days after their alleged victim's body was found . She . told the Denver Post that they seemed like they were good people until . their money started running out. Court documents reveal the extent of . their troubles. In . 2003, Styler had taken his previous company, Colorado Anesthesia . Consultants, to court in a dispute over software Styler had co-created, . but he lost the case. He . accused his lawyer John Powell, whom he had paid $600,000, for . overcharging him for legal services - and in 2010, Styler sued Powell . for the debt, the Aspen Times reported. He . won and Powell was put on probation and ordered to pay $800,000. But . before the Stylers got the money, Powell filed for bankruptcy, . protecting him from having to pay the . debt. The report in the . Aspen Times says that the scandal led Styler to express suicidal . thoughts, including telling an attorney that he wanted to commit . 'suicide by cop'. In court: Nancy Styler is escorted by two deputies to Pitkin County Courthouse during her first appearance earlier this month . Locked up: Styler - who had been suffering various illnesses before his arrest, -and his wife are being held without bond . 'It was very devastating to him,' said Paul Gordon, a Denver attorney who represented Styler. Last summer, Powell complained to the state's Attorney . Regulation Counsel that Styler was observing his house - and Styler responded that he was trying to find out if Powell still lived there . As . recently as November last year, Styler had written to the . court’s Attorney Regulation Counsel about his frustrations in collecting . money - the same time he was renting the property from . Pfister. When she returned from Australia and . evicted the couple nearly two weeks ago, they had been staying at the . Aspenalt Lodge in Basalt, where rooms cost $119 per night. On Monday, William Styler was taken . from the motel still wearing his bathrobe, while his wife was seen with . tears streaming down her face. Missed: Pfister, pictured right with her daughter, wrote on Facebook that she was returning early from Australia as she was having trouble with tenants who were not paying the rent or bills . Heartbroken: Pfister's daughter Juliana said that had to be something more to her mother's death . They appeared in court on Tuesday - . William Styler in a wheelchair - where they were ordered to be held . without bond. They will next appear in court on March 17. Well-connected: Nancy Pfister was once briefly engaged to actor Michael Douglas . Nancy Pfister's remains were cremated on Monday and relatives and residents are holding a memorial service for her on March 15. Her murder - the first in Pitkin County, Colorado in more than a decade - has rocked the small ski resort town, where residents said Pfister had been a popular, well-connected resident. 'She'd been one of the golden girls of Aspen, seriously into the party scene [in her youth],' a source told Page Six. 'She hung out with the Kennedys, Jack Nicholson, Cher, Michael Douglas.' The source added that Pfister was even once briefly engaged to Douglas. Pfister's . daughter has said she refuses to accept her mother could have been . killed over a tenant dispute - and apparently further evidence that the . couple had money troubles. 'How . could someone just be so angry that they got kicked out of a house? There’s got to be something more. It's hard to understand that', her . daughter Juliana asked, ABC News reported. Her daughter Juliana added that her mother had been a beloved member of the community. 'I . have no idea how someone could do something like that and especially to . her and I think that, you know, my mom could never hurt anything or . hurt anyone and that is one thing that everyone that knew her knew,' Pfister said. 'She cared about a lot of people and helped the wrong . people this time.' Scene: Pfister was found dead in her home, pictured, which she had rented to the Stylers while she traveled . The Aspen Times reported . that Pfister was the daughter of Art and Betty Pfister, a prominent . local couple who played a major role in the development of the ski . resorts.

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . A retired New York high school librarian and a New Jersey auto mechanic were convicted Friday of scheming to carry out gruesome fantasies of kidnapping, raping, torturing and killing women and girls. The verdicts in Christopher Asch and Michael Van Hise's conspiracy trial came a year after a conviction in a headline-grabbing case of a police officer accused of plotting abductions and cannibalism. A fourth man, a former hospital police chief, pleaded guilty in January. Together, the cases plumbed an online underground where people share macabre fetishes, and the prosecutions hinged on the boundaries between imagining and actually intending to bring fantasies to life. Guilty: Christopher Asch (left) and Michael Van Hise (right) were both found guilty Friday . Lawyers for both said they would appeal. No sentencing date was set. 'Today, a unanimous jury found that the twisted conspiracies of Michael Van Hise and Robert Christopher Asch were not mere fantasy, but steps within very real plans to kidnap real victims,' Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement, using Asch's full name; he goes by Christopher. But defense lawyers said the men's alleged plans were no more real than the plots of horror movies or violent pornography. 'We knew, from the outset, that it was going to be difficult to overcome the graphic nature of this case, even though we thought it was pure fantasy,' said Asch's attorney, Brian Waller. Asch and Van Hise showed little reaction as jurors delivered a verdict that could put them in prison for life. But Waller called Asch ""crushed,"" and one of Van Hise's attorneys, Alice Fontier, said he seemed shocked. Asch, a former librarian at Manhattan's prestigious Stuyvesant High School, and Van Hise, a mechanic from Trenton, N.J., were accused of planning to victimize members of Van Hise's family, including girls under 10. Asch also was convicted of targeting another woman, who turned out to be an undercover FBI agent. Prosecutors said Van Hise and Asch took concrete steps across the line between pretending and plotting. They met once in Trenton and drove around talking about places to dispose of bodies, Asch searched online for tips on knockout drugs to overpower potential victims, and Van Hise emailed Asch pictures of his possible-target relatives - who included his wife, step-daughter, sister-in-law and nieces, prosecutors noted. Horrible: Christopher Asch was part of a plot to kidnap and eat people . He's supposed to protect: NYPD cop Mike Valle is said to have organized the scheme, and reportedly wanted to kill and eat 100 people . In the other alleged plot, Asch covertly watched the undercover agent and amassed a stock of torture tools, including a 20-million-volt stun gun, a whip, clamps, skewers and gynecological implements, according to evidence at the trial. 'None of this was fake,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Hadassa Waxman said in a closing argument. 'They were absolutely serious.' Defense lawyers said Asch, 24, and Van Hise, 61, were only role-playing and would never have actually hurt anyone. Van Hise's supposed schemes were riddled with impossibilities, like kidnapping his sister-in-law from work when she didn't have a job, and he was so far from acting on his desires that he told his wife about them, Fontier said. She suggested jurors 'voted out of fear' of what might have been if the men were serious. Asch's lawyer said his client's discussions and preparations didn't amount to truly planning to do anything violent. 'That's the thrill of role-playing - collecting items, stuff like that - but it's all safe,' Waller said Tuesday. Asch and Van Hise were charged last year along with Richard Meltz, a former police chief at the Bedford Veterans Administration Medical Center in Massachusetts. He pleaded guilty to conspiracy and is facing up to 10 years in prison at his sentencing, set for May. The police officer who was accused of plotting cannibalism, Gilberto Valle, is awaiting sentencing. Van Hise was initially accused of scheming with Valle, but references to Valle and cannibalism were ultimately excluded from the indictment in the case against Asch and Van Hise.","Christopher Asch and Michael Van Hise were found guilty of conspiring with an NYPD cop to kill and eat people .

The girl was separated from her mother 15 months ago due to war in the Democratic Republic of Congo . Nirere is one of thousands of Congolese people who could reconnect thanks to Humanitarian Jean-Marie Minani who helps run the Mugunga camp - home to around 8,000 families. Mr Minani manages four free calling booths at the Camp as part of the Instant Network programme - supported by the Vodafone Foundation. Another camp member Mama Furaha spoke to her brothers for the first time in two years after they were separated two years ago. Both of the woman's parents were killed during the war and she was separated from her family shortly afterwards. The woman smiles as she speaks with her surprised family - who at first do not seem to recognise her voice. Muma Furaha (centre holding a child) sits among fellow residents before she speaks with her brothers . Residents of the Mugunga Refugee Camp wait to use one of four telephone booths in the camp . She then beams as the conversation continues - adding 'I am happy' to the cameras. Those living at the Mugunga camp are able to make five minutes of free calls a week. The scheme started in the camp in October 2013 and since then 2,000 calls a week have been made. The initiative has provided around 17,000 displaced people in the camp with access to free mobile calls. Jean-Marie Minani said: 'Many of the families in the camp have been unable to contact family members left behind in their home villages. 'It is amazing to be able to put a smile on the faces of some of these people and provide them with an emotional lifeline. For me, this is not just a job, it is a vocation.' Jean-Marie Minani helps a woman use a telephone in the camp . Over 17,000 people have made contact with their loved ones at the booths, one pictured . Oisin Walton, Instant Network Programme Manager at the Vodafone Foundation, said: 'Jean-Marie is passionate about connecting families who have been displaced as a result of the conflict in the Congo. 'For the first time, the refugees in the camp have access to free calls to reconnect and stay in touch with their relatives. 'This is one example of how a simple mobile phone call has the power to reunite families and transform people's lives.' The Second Congo War began in August 1998 - just a year after year the First Congo War. A ceasefire deal was signed in 2003, but many are still suffering from its affects.","Congolese families torn apart by war speak with loved ones via the phone .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The family of a 13-year-old Oakland girl who was declared 'brain-dead' more than three months ago following complications after a routine tonsil surgery say the girl is showing signs of life now that she's been moved from the hospital that released her body to the coroner's office in early January. Additionally, the family has slammed a state report that determined that the Children's Hospital Oakland - with which the family of Jahi McMath fought in court over whether to take the girl off of life support - complied with medical regulatory standards in its handling of Jahi's case. Family members now say that while Jahi remains unconscious, she looks healthy and has been moving her head and legs on a regular basis. Wedding: This photograph shows Jahi McMath (right) at the wedding of her step-father Marvin Winkfield (2nd right) to her mother Naliah (not pictured) - also in this photograph are Mariana Winkfield (left) and her grandmother Sandra Chatman (2nd left) In an interview with San Francisco . Chronicle, Jahi's uncle Omari Sealy claims the teen tosses and turns in . her hospital bed and has signaled that she is aware of what is going on . around her. Sealy . claims his niece will turn in the direction of those who come to visit . her in her hospital bed, which indicates that she's aware of what's . going on around her. 'She . moves so much, she can turn on her side,' he told the paper. 'They have . to keep her bed rails up. They're afraid she could fall out of bed.' However, . medical experts say movements like that is not uncommon of people who . are brain-dead - they say it is a product of muscle and spinal reflexes . responding to the mechanical supports attached to their bodies. The . medical community believes that brain-dead people are not alive, and . that a brain-dead person can survive on machines for several months but . their condition ultimately will deteriorate. 'She definitely knows where she is and . that we're present,' Sealy said. 'One of the misconceptions out there is . that she's deteriorating or is going to deteriorate over time. But her . skin looks better than mine.' Brief relief: Nailah Winkfield has an emotional moment Monday after learning her daughter Jahi McMath will be kept on life support until January 7 . Wrenching moment: Nailah Winkfield (right) has a . moment of relief after Monday evening's news that her daughter Jahi . McMath (right) may remain on life support until January 7 after a judge . granted a temporary halt to plans to remove the 13-year-old from life . support . Doctors had told the family that as Jahi's condition continues to deteriorate, her skin would lose much of its complexion. On . Thursday, a report compiled by the California Department of Public . Health concluded that the Children's Hospital Oakland met regulatory . standards in its handling of Jahi's case - a conclusion the girl's . family and the attorney that represent them do not accept. In a series of tweets, Sealy dismissed the report as 'BS' and said the CDPH never interviewed the family. 'The State never interviewed the family . who was THERE to witness Jahi bleeding to ""CA brain death"" & there . is no answer why she bled?' Sealey wrote. 'What's . done in the dark, will come to light.' The . state would not comment specifically on the girl's case, but issued a . generic statement to the San Jose Mercury News saying that Jahi's case . was reviewed in response to a complaint issued about her care. Family announcement: Jahi's uncle Omari Sealey (pictured) spoke to reporters Monday evening just before a 5pm Pacific deadline when his brain dead niece's ventilator was due to be switched off . Hope: This is the New Beginnings Center in Medway, Long Island, where the family of Jahi McMath hope to send her by private jet by January 7 in a bid to keep her alive . Winkfield and her family are now in a renewed race against time to get their little girl transferred to a facility willing to care for a legally dead patient . 'I am just thanking God and everyone who has supported us. I am going to fight with everything I have got,' Winkfield said Monday . 'The California Department of Public . Health conducted a comprehensive survey of care and services received by . each patient sampled in the survey,' the agency said. Additionally, the hospital defended the investigation and the results. Christopher . Dolan, an attorney representing the girl's family, issued a statement . of his own in response to the report, relegating the investigation to a . case of doctors protecting doctors. Dolan . also says that even though the hospital was found to follow the general . institutional criteria, it doesn't mean that there wasn't medical . negligence in treating the girl. Additionally, . she says that her daughter is alive and not suffering - now that she's . been moved from the Children's Hospital Oakland to a long-term care . facility. 'I have been surrounded by the love, . support and prayers of so many kind people,' Winkfield says in the letter. 'Despite what people say . about my daughter being dead and how I must be ignorant not to get that, . I can tell you that she is much better physically since she has left . Children's Hospital and I see changes that give me hope.' McMath was declared brain dead following a tonsil surgery intended to help the girl's sleep apnea on December 9. Struggle: Jahi's family is pitted against a hospital they've called uncaring in their struggle to keep the brain dead teen hooked to life support. Here, Children's Hospital of Oakland spokesman Sam Singer updates reporters on Jahi's condition December 30. Doctors contend she has no possibility of ever waking up . Precautions: Officials saw to it that the door to the Children's Hospital of Oakland was barricaded Monday in preparation for Jahi's family's press conference . Tragedy: Jahi McMath, 13, was declared legally . brain-dead after undergoing a routine tonsil removal that dosctors . suggested as a means of eliminating her sleep apnea . Last photos: Mrs Winkfield snapped this picture of daughter Jahi the morning she took her to the hospital to undergo a tonsillectomy that ended up all but ending her life . Unexpected: After coming out of surgery, Jahi . started bleeding from the mouth and was eventually ruled brain-dead. The . hospital that performed the procedure no longer wants to keep the girl . on life support . Dede Logan, of Oakland, adds red stars to a poster in support of Jahi McMath in front of Children's Hospital Oakland in Oakland, Calif., on Monday, Dec. 23, 2013 . Following . the surgery, the girl suffered tremendous blood loss and went into . cardiac arrest. The poor circulation as a result of the severe blood . loss caused injuries to her brain that doctors considered to be fatal. On December 12, doctors declared the . girl brain dead and sought a medical declaration of death for the . 13-year-old. Her family, however, refused to accept the doctors' decision to declare the girl dead - while technically brain dead, the . girl's organs were being kept alive by machines. The disagreement led to court proceedings to determine whether the family had the right to keep McMath on life support. The . family petitioned the Alameda County Superior Court to step in when . doctors wanted to take McMath off of life support. The court then . appointed Paul Graham Fisher, the . chief of Child Neurology at Stanford University School of Medicine, to . give a second opinion on the girl's condition. Fisher . agreed with the doctors at Children's Hospital, noting that McMath had . no activity on an electroencephalogram, no blood flow to the brain and . she was unable to breathe on her own. Winkfield . appealed the decision to take her daughter off of life support, and the . court gave her an extension that required the hospital to keep her on a . ventilator until January 7. The court, however, denied a request to give McMath a feeding tube or a tracheostomy. On January 5, the hospital released McMath's body to the county coroner, which released the body to Winkfield. McMath currently is being kept alive on life support at an undisclosed location.","Family members claim the 13-year-old girl tosses and turns in her bed .

"By . Paul Donnelley . She is the little girl with long golden hair just like the fairytale heroine Rapunzel. At just six-years-old Sophie Fieldhouse has grown her beautiful blonde locks until they reach almost to the ground. But she also has a rare and potentially lethal form of diabetes called congenital hyperinsulinism. Sophie Fieldhouse has a rare disease (a potentially lethal form of diabetes) that was diagnosed when she was 18-months-old and the treatment she receives has the side effect of making her hair grow . It causes low blood sugar and one of the . only treatments for it is a drug called Diazoxide, which makes her hair . grow much quicker than normal. Sophie was diagnosed with the condition, which affects one in 50,000 people,  when she was just 18-months-old. Sophie, from Failsworth, is one of just over a dozen children with the condition who took park in the new trial using fish oils . Six-year-old Sophie Fieldhouse from failsworth has had fish oil trials by Manchester University to help with her rare and potentially lethal form of diabetes . Some of six-year-old Sophie Fieldhouse's schoolmates have been unkind about her long hair without realising that the growth is caused by her medicine she takes for her rare form of diabetes . The name covers a variety of conditions in which hypoglycaemia (literally: low blood sugar) is caused by excessive insulin secretion.Sufferers are born with the disease although less severe forms may not become apparent until adulthood.Mild cases are treated merely by eating frequently; more severe ones require medication and very severe cases may need surgery to remove part or most of the pancreas to protect the brain from damage due to recurrent hypoglycaemia. They were given supplements of fish oils in the form of capsules similar to cod liver oil. The new treatment has proved so successful that Sophie is no longer taking Diazoxide. Her mum Amanda Turner, 37, said: ""The condition is scary because when Sophie's blood sugar is low she we see a complete change in her. 'It's like looking at a completely different child. She gets very hungry and gets the shakes. She has to take extra snacks to school and her hair is also very long because of the treatment. 'Children have said things to her about her hair without realising it and it isn't a nice thing to have, but the school have been very good.' 'This new trial has been brilliant and we have now been able to stop the Diazoxide, which is fantastic. 'We just hope that this treatment will soon be available to all children with congenital hyperinsulinism.'","Sophie, six, from Failsworth has a potentially lethal form of diabetes called congenital hyperinsulinism .

Tragic end: The little girl, pictured here with her cousin, was found frozen to death outside an apartment building in Minnesota . The first-grader from Horace May Elementary School was found by both her mother and a neighbor, who both immediately called 911, said authorities. Police said little Mercedes was dressed in a coat, boots, hat and mittens by emergency service personnel, who arrived at the scene minutes after being called. It is not clear how the girl had managed to get outside, but it appeared she may have been there overnight.

"By . Neil Sears . The fabulously wealthy Aga Khan has finally divorced his second wife after a ten year legal battle - paying her £50million. The 77-year-old British citizen is most often in the public eye thanks to his racehorses, yet is the spiritual leader of the 12 million members of the mystical Ismaili sect of Islam. His lengthy court fight with third wife Princess Gabriele zu Leiningen, 50 - who was previously married to a minor European prince and is herself distantly related to the British royal family - has been excruciatingly embarrassing. The Aga Khan, spiritual leader to millions of Muslims, has finalised his 2011 divorce from German princess Gabriele Renate Inaara Zu Leiningen, after years of legal dispute . Lawyers for the Aga Khan and his ex-wife (pictured) released a statement on Friday saying their marriage 'ends by consent' after the Paris Court of Appeals approved a divorce settlement . The couple started divorce proceedings in 2004 . While some believe he is a direct . descendent of the Prophet Mohammed, and many of his adoring followers . give him a share of their earnings, the divorce battle has seen him . being accused of having an affair with an air hostess. So . he must have heaved a huge sigh of relief on Friday when a Paris court . made its final decision on the case behind closed doors. And . although the payout is a French record, and five times an earlier . settlement made in Paris before it was appealed, many commentators . believe the Aga Khan has got off lightly. Some had predicted the divorce . could end up costing him £500m. The . divorce case had begun in London before switching to France, where . settlements have never reached British or American heights. Happier times:  His Higness the Aga Khan and German-born Princess Gabrielle zu Leiningen during their wedding held at the Aga Khan's French residence Aiglemont . Bitter split: The Aga Khan and his wife were divorced in 2011, but only now have proceedings been finalised and he has to pay the £50million ordered by a French court . The . Aga Khan, whose ancestors fled Persia for India two centuries ago, was . born in Switzerland, and now spends most of his time in France, despite . having British citizenship. He . inherited his title from his grandfather in 1957 and is believed by his . followers to be 'the bringer of life'. In spite of his sometimes . turbulent private life he remains revered for the worldwide charitable . works he has directed funds to. His . first wife was British model Sally Croker-Poole, who he married in . 1969. They had two sons and a daughter. Eldest son Prince Rahim, 42, is . expected to be his official successor. That . first marriage ended after 25 years, and he married Princess Gabrielle . in 1998 at his huge Aiglemont estate, near Paris. She is a German former . pop singer who converted to Islam for her marriage, and adopted the new . name of Inaara. The couple had a son, but after six years announced their separation. In . the course of their highly publicised break-up it has been claimed that . the estranged wife hired surveillance experts to prove her belief that . her husband was having an affair. There have more recently been reports that the Aga Khan is considering marrying for a third time. When . the Parisian Court of Appeals finally approved a secret agreement . between the couple on Friday, lawyers for both side refused to comment . on the reputed £50 payout for the Princess. The .

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has defied public uproar over large sums of public money being spent on portraits of MPs – and agreed to pose for one himself. Commons chiefs have commissioned a £10,000 painting of the Liberal Democrat leader to be hung in the Palace of Westminster. The decision comes just weeks after MPs were denounced for spending £250,000 on portraits of a raft of fellow parliamentarians, including a £10,000 picture of Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith. Mr Clegg’s office has defended the move, saying it was the House of Commons, not the Lib Dem leader, which commissioned the work. But last night Mr Clegg faced calls to follow the example of Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman, who two years ago pulled out of a similar taxpayer-funded project because it would not be right in the current economic climate. Labour MP Simon Danczuk said that if Mr Clegg refused to decline ‘this outrageous extravagance’, it would prove how ‘out of touch’ he was with hard-working families. ‘Past decisions on Commons arts commissions are one thing but going ahead with this in such economically difficult times cannot be justified,’ said Mr Danczuk. ‘With hard-working people struggling to make ends meet, this is no time for Nick Clegg to let the taxpayer fork out a small fortune just so he can be immortalised in oils.’ The Commons art collection is overseen by a special committee of MPs which advises Speaker John Bercow and commissions paintings and sculptures. The collection, designed to record 600 years of parliamentary history, now has so many portraits of MPs that they fill several corridors in the Portcullis House block opposite Big Ben. Sources told The Mail on Sunday that the . idea of getting Mr Clegg  to pose for a portrait was first suggested . several years ago but only recently got the go-ahead from the Deputy PM.

Commons officials are refusing to issue details of the commission, including the name of the artist, as it is ‘commercially sensitive’. Last night, a spokesman for Mr Clegg said decisions on portraits were made by the Commons’ art committee and not by the Government or the Deputy Prime Minister. ‘Party leaders and Ministers are often selected and we agreed to the request on that basis,’ he added.","Liberal Democrat leader facing calls to pull out of the project .

"By . William Turvill . This terrifying photograph shows the venomous huntsman spider that jumped out of a charity worker’s backpack when she returned to the UK. Nora Serrat, 32, found the spider with a huge egg sac – containing up to 400 babies – after coming back to London from a two-week charity trip to the Cameroonian rainforest. The spider, which is known to prey on scorpions and even bats, was described by a member of the charity, the Rainforest Foundation UK, as ‘feisty’. This is the giant venomous spider that a charity worker accidentally brought to the UK from Cameroon . According to the Evening Standard, Ms Serrat discovered the spider when she was unpacking from the trip. The charity worker said she believes the spider crawled into her sleeping mat in the rainforest. She told the paper: ‘It's not an impossible thing to happen considering the places we visited - but it was still a bit of a surprise.’ Ms Serrat, who specialises in mapping and forest governance for the charity, said colleagues caught the huntsman in a carton box after discovering it. Nora Serrat, 32, found the spider with a huge egg sac - containing up to 400 babies - after returning to London from a two-week charity trip to the west African nation . They found it using a cardboard box in the charity’s Camden office. The charity staff then contacted the Zoological Society of London for them to take the creature of their hands. Rachel Agnew, of the charity, told the Evening Standard that no harm appeared to have come to the spider, which when they dropped it off appeared ‘alive and apparently quite feisty’. Native to the tropical regions of the world, the Heteropoda venatoria is a species of the Sparassidae, or huntsman, spiders. Its body can grow to 2.8cm in length and the female produces an egg sac of around 2.5cm wide, which can carry up to 400 eggs. The spiders prey of insects, scorpions and even bats. It is sensitive to the cold, and can only live outside in certain climates.","Nora Serrat found the spider after returning from two weeks in Cameroon where she was working for charity the Rainforest Foundation UK .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The body of a 24-year-old American woman traveling alone in Thailand and missing for five days was found over the weekend in a national park, trampled by elephants. Lily Glidden's body was so badly damaged that authorities immediately came to the startling conclusion after finding her January 18 following a manhunt that brought in 70 people. The Tufts graduate of Freeville, New York, had been taking pictures of the animals in Kaeng Krachan National . Park, just outside Bangkok. Scroll down for video . Animal-lover: Lily Glidden posted about her adventures helping animals on Facebook. She previously helped to relocate wolves, left, and posed with snakes in Hong Kong, right . Crushed: Lily Glidden was found crumpled in the woods of Thailand's Kaeng Krachan National Park January 18 (elephants in the park pictured). Authorities revealed today that the American tourist was trampled by wild elephants . Remote: Kaeng Krachan is Thailand's largest national forest and is well known for its elephants but attacks are rare . Her devastated family paid tribute to her and her work to help animals in a statement to NBC today. 'We believe that what happened to Lily was a result of unknowable and unusual circumstances which she must have been unable to foresee or prevent.' 'Lily was very aware of the dangers of working with wildlife and not a person to court foolish risks, particularly where animals were involved.' 'She had an educated and dedicated respect for the natural world and was completely comfortable in it. She did extensive solo hiking and backpacking in many parts throughout the West and knew how to respond to chance encounters with bears and other potentially dangerous animals.' 'She was also a fearless individual... We would wish her remembered as an extremely competent professional in her chosen field.' Park rangers announced Thursday they'd found the body in the park outside Bangkok. Glidden was found crumpled in the woods after the search team was deployed. 'Her arms, her wrists and other parts of the body were broken, so we assumed she was trampled by elephants because no humans could have caused such powerful damage to the body,' said police Col. Woradet Suanklaai. Police sent the body to a forensic institute in the capital to determine the cause of death, he said. Graduate: The biology student hoped to become a vet after completing her travels . Tragic death: The 24-year-old left her camp site to take photos of wildlife throughout the park . Kaeng Krachan is the largest national park in Thailand, covering nearly 32,300 square feet of forest. It is 124 miles southwest of Bangkok. Woradet said Glidden was alone when she left a camping ground in the park. 'Looking at the pictures she took in her camera, we see a lot of animals, birds, snakes, lizards,' Woradet said. 'We assumed she wanted to take pictures of elephants because that's what the Kaeng Krachan National Park is famous for. We believe she wanted to find them and take some photos.' Tragic: Kaeng Krachan is world famous for its wild Asian elephants. Authorities say Glidden, who was traveling alone, was taking photos of them when she was killed . On her Facebook page, the biology student showed her love of animals. Various pictures show her posing alongside snakes, wolves and a pet tortoise. She had taken courses at the Vermont Wilderness School and the Wilderness Awareness School in Washington and wanted to work as a vet. She was also president of the Tufts outdoor club.","Lily Glidden, 24, a recent graduate of Tufts University was traveling alone when she apparently got too close to the wild animals .

"By . Simon Walters . The influx of Romanian and Bulgarian immigrants has led to a surge in support for Britain leaving the European Union. A new survey indicates that 50 per cent of the population would cut the UK’s ties with Brussels, with a record low 33 per cent in favour of staying in. The 17 per cent margin in a Survation poll for The Mail on Sunday is one of the biggest gaps in recent ‘In or Out’ EU surveys. Now half the population wants to cut ties with Brussels. In June just one per cent was in favour of leaving . It is in stark contrast with a similar poll in June which showed just a one per cent majority in favour of leaving the EU, with 45 in the ‘Out’ corner and 44 ‘In’. Significantly, the 33 per cent in the new poll who want to stay in is the lowest ever number polled by Survation on the issue. Three out of ten say the arrival of . migrants from Romania and Bulgaria since the New Year has made them more . likely to vote to go it alone in a referendum on Britain’s future in . Europe. The issue has also . led to a revival in the ratings of UKIP leader Nigel Farage. His party . is back to 16 per cent, ahead of the Lib Dems on 11 per cent,  but . behind Labour on 35 and the Conservatives on 31. The level of concern sparked by Romanian . and Bulgarian migrants is underlined in a  league table of 16 voters’ concerns, ranging from immigration to jobs, welfare and Scottish . independence. Immigration is way ahead, with 29 per cent saying it was their biggest worry, with the cost of living a distant second on 17, the economy on 15, national debt on 13, and unemployment at eight. The chief concern about the impact of Romanian and Bulgarian migrants is how schools will cope with extra children. An overwhelming 77 per cent say the strain on schools is their  biggest fear. The extra cost of welfare handouts and the effect on community tensions come next in the list. An increase in begging and a drop in wages for British workers are not far behind. But to some extent, British workers may have themselves to blame, according to the poll. A total of 45 per cent say UK firms who employ Romanians and Bulgarians instead of Britons cannot be blamed because immigrants work harder. Intriguingly, the willingness of individuals to employ Romanians and Bulgarians who charge lower rates than their British counterparts varies sharply, depending on the nature of the work. Asked if they would use a British decorator who charged £500 or a Romanian or Bulgarian who charged £400, people chose the British worker. They made the same choice presented with a British baby sitter at £8 an hour or a Romanian or Bulgarian for £7 an hour. But offered a British car wash for £6 or a Romanian or Bulgarian one for £5, they chose the latter. The survey also confirms the view of most pundits that fears over immigration are fuelling support for Mr Farage and his anti-EU UKIP party, who are poised to inflict a crushing defeat on the Tories in May’s European Parliament elections. According to Survation, Labour will win 32 per cent of votes in the Euro elections, UKIP 26, the Tories 23 and Lib Dems nine. However, David Cameron can take some comfort from the indication that he is still more trusted than other party leaders on immigration. A total of 31 per cent back his stance, with 29 for Mr Farage, 26 for Ed Miliband and 15 for Nick Clegg. Comment: Page 25 .","Survey reveals half population would cut ties with Brussels .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Heartbreaking dilemma: Sara Goldberg, 63, says she was declared a 'suppressive person' by the Church of Scientology for not ending her relationship with her apostate son . Sara Goldberg, a one-time high-ranking member of the Church of Scientology, claims she was given an impossible 'Sophie's choice' by her superiors that ended up tearing her close-knit family apart. According to Mrs Goldberg, 63, from Florida, church elders pressed her to sever ties with her son, Nick Lister, who was accused of being connected with Scientology apostates. When the woman refused to willingly 'disconnect' from her renegade son, as church teachings dictate, she was put on trial at the Scientology compound in Clearwater. According to Goldberg, who had been a devout Scientologist for more than three decades, she was presented with a choice: she could either turn her back on her son, or become a pariah and be estranged from her daughter. 'You're giving me Sophie's choice,' Goldberg reportedly said at her trial in July, as Tampa Bay Times reported in its detailed expose. The Church of Scientology defines the practice of 'disconnection' as the act of breaking ties with a person who is hostile to the teachings of L. Ron Habbard, and whose antagonism could impede the spiritual progress of those around him. According to the organization's website, there are two ways of dealing with a 'suppressive person’ who wishes to harm the church: one either 'handles' the troublemaker by presenting him with factual data about Scientology, or 'disconnects' from the person by refusing to communicate with him. The latter technique is described as a 'last resort' that is to be employed only when all other attempts to 'handle' the 'suppressive’ fail. In his writings, Habbard compared 'disconnection' to the way the broader society deals with criminals. ‘In other words, they remove the guy from society and put him in a prison because he won’t handle his problem or otherwise cease to commit criminal acts against others,’ the Scientology founder explained. Rebel with a cause: Sara Goldberg's son, Nick Lister, ran into trouble with the Church of Scientology when he started communicating with known apostates; as a result, he became a pariah . Sara's choice: Sara Goldberg was presented with a choice: she could either sever all ties with Nick (far left), or face the possibility of being shunned by her daughter and granddaughter (right) It is important to note that the Church of Scientology stresses that there is no policy on the books that requires congregants to disconnect from family members and friends who hold different beliefs. 'The Church encourages excellent family relationships, Scientologists or not, and family relations routinely improve with Scientology because the Scientologist learns how to increase communication and resolve any problems that may have previously existed,' the statement on Scientology.com reads. But according to Mrs Goldberg, she was forced to cut ties with her own son, who was labeled a suppressive person - or 'SP' - for his ties to Scientology whistle-blowers - or face the possibility of being alienated from her daughter, Ashley. In the end, Sara Goldberg, who had reached the highest rank in the church hierarchy, refused to turn her back on Nick and was ejected from the community that she had been a part of for 36 years. Sara Goldberg first became interested in Scientology in her late 20s when she sought spiritual counselling – known as ‘auditing’ in Scientology parlance - following a painful break-up. As time went on, Goldberg became increasingly drawn to the religion, quickly rising through the ranks of the organization, marrying a fellow Scientologist and raising her two children, Nick and Ashley, in the church. Following her divorce in the late 1990s, Sara married another Scientologist, Sheldon Goldberg. Together, the couple attained the highest level of spirituality known as Operating Thetan VIII. Always faithful: Both Sara Goldberg and her second husband, Sheldon, refused to turn their back on Nick (far left), even as his sister, friends and even his biological father 'disconnected' from him as punishment for his subversive activities . Goldberg’s daughter, Ashley, was also an active member of the church who followed in her mother's footsteps by marrying a second-generation Scientologist. The couple have a young daughter. Everything was going well for the family until Sara Goldberg's son, Nick Lister, began running into trouble and breaking church rules. Growing increasingly skeptical of Scientology, the renegade teenager began spending time with known critics of the church, among them Marty Rathbun and Mike Rinder, who had been shunned for leaking damaging information about the inner workings of the religious organization to newspapers. When news of Lister's affiliation with the circle of apostates became known to church officials, he was forced to stop communicating with them. In response to the pressure from the community, the 22-year-old turned to alcohol and drugs. He entered a Scientology rehab center and returned home clean, but soon renewed his acquaintance with a church defector. Fall from grace: Last year, the once-elite members of the Church of Scientology were declared 'suppressive persons' for their refusal to turn their back on Nick Lister . When the elders caught wind of Lister's behavior, he was punished by being labeled a ‘suppressive person.’ The consequences were disastrous: one by one, Lister's sister, brother-in-law, childhood friends and even his biological father turned away from him. But his mother and her husband stood by his side. At first, church officials encouraged the Goldbergs to try and 'handle' their wayward offspring by bringing him back into the fold. Nick Lister told Tampa Bay Times that he had made a good-faith effort to reconcile with the church by turning his back on the enemies of Scientology, revealing information about their activities and taking re-education courses in a bid to lift his 'suppressive person' classification. Despite his efforts to make things right with the church, Lister felt that Scientology officials were stone-walling him. He finally stopped trying to get back into the good graces of the powerful organization. Things came to a head in the summer of 2012, when an increasingly anxious Sheldon Goldberg asked his stepson to move out of their house. Nick Lister responded by getting drunk and threatening to end his life. The church continued ratcheting up the pressure on the Goldbergs to disconnect from the malcontent young man, but Sara said in no uncertain terms that she would not turn her back on her child when he was at his most vulnerable. During her trial several weeks later, a tearful Mrs Goldberg declared to the judges: 'I'm not leaving my son.' Over the next few months, Mrs Goldberg devoured news reports about allegations of wrongdoing against high-ranking church officials, doing so in violation of a strictly enforced policy that prohibits its members from looking up Scientology on the Internet. Finally, in July 2013, Sheldon and Sara Goldberg received a letter from the church declaring the couple 'suppressive' for refusing to disconnect from Nick Lister. Within hours, the woman's world came crashing down when her daughter, Ashley, confronted her and said that her entire family, including Sara Goldberg’s only granddaughter, must disconnect from her. Mrs Goldberg, 63, told the paper that her final message from her daughter came in the form of an email asking her not to contact her again until she makes things rights with the church.","Sara Goldberg, 63, and her husband were declared 'suppressive persons' by the church for refusing to sever ties with her son, Nick .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . How many rights would you be willing to relinquish in order to sing to the back of a chair? A leaked legal document that contestants of The Voice must sign in order to appear on the TV talent show has exposed the production's potential for distortion and the umbrella of power NBC ensures it has. The 32-page contract was obtained by the NY Daily News and details how producers can cut anyone from the line-up, break and change rules of the competition at their discretion, script winners and send the singing hopefuls for medical and/or psychological tests and broacast the results. One clause also reportedly says they can ignore the show's voting system in 'the event of problems'. Scroll down for video . Fine print: The contract that The Voice contestants are forced to sign has revealed what little rights they have when appearing on the show, which this year features the new judging panel of (L-R) Shakira, Usher, Adam Levine and Blake Shelton . Previously: (L-R) Blake Shelton, Christina Aguilera, Cee Lo Green and Adam Levine have been the staple 'coaches' of the series, which is now its sixth season . Another warns contestants the show 'may be disparaging, defamatory, embarrassing (and) may expose [them] to public ridicule, humiliation or condemnation'. It also warns they could 'portray [them] in a false light'. The cast-iron contract has been drafted so that none of the fledgling reality stars that enter the show can sue NBC afterwards. 'The second clause of this document says to contestants, ''F--k you'',' a legal expert told the NY Daily News of the contract. 'And if you missed it, the clauses that follow say, ''F--k you''.' NBC and the show's producers have denied that any manipulation occurs in the making of the show, such as changing the voting counts, and say that such clauses are precautionary. However it has helped explain the surprise and somewhat controversial elimination of viewer favorite Judith Hill last season. Hill, who was chosen to sign a due with Michael Jackson during ill-fated This Is It tour and went on to sign at his memorial, was considered an early frontrunner. However she was cut during a random upset, along with fellow contestant Sarah Simmons. Shocking: Fan favorite Judith Hill - a friend of Michael Jackson - was surprisingly eliminated last year. The leaked contract has shed some light on the situation and the power producer's have to make decisions . Judith Hill instantly became the early frontrunner on the show last season, but was surprisingly cut from the lineup . In another episode last May, producers were forced to admit they had discarded thousands of votes cast via social media and text. The admission came after Telescope, the outside company that monitors the votes, found 'some inconsistencies'. 'For complete fairness, votes cast via text and online were not counted in the voting results,' host Carson Daly said at the time. 'We value our relationship with our viewers. But, bizarrely, the then added: 'Telescope certifies that removing those votes did not affect the outcome for any team.' AN NBC representative would not elaborate on the contracts being made public. The talent search series, hosted by Carson Daly, says the cast-iron contracts are routine for reality television . 'The integrity of our competition shows, including ‘The Voice,’ is of the utmost importance to NBC,' the rep said. One legal expert thick document is 'smartly written' and there is nothing untoward in the contract, despite the way it may sound. 'These kinds of shows have been around for a while and ... have been sued or threatened with lawsuits quite a bit,' the expert said. 'Tough language is standard now in the industry.' The Voice is now its six season and this year features Shakira, Usher, Adam Levine and Blake Shelton as coaches. Typically Levine and Shelton are joined by Christina Aguilera and CeeLo Green. It debuted this year to an audience of 15.74 million viewers.","Contract leak showing what contestants must agree to in order to compete on The Voice .

"By . Associated Press . A man has been executed by lethal injection at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary almost 20 years after orchestrating the brutal assault and robbery of his co-worker at a Tulsa convenience store. Michael Lee Wilson, 38, was convicted in the killing of Richard Yost, 30, who aspired to one day manage the Quiktrip store. Wilson, who was convicted of first-degree murder, was the third person executed for the February 25, 1995, crime; the fourth defendant is serving a life term. Prison spokesman Jerry Massie said Wilson's time of death was 6:06 p.m. Wilson gave brief remarks twice - at first saying, 'I love everybody,' then speaking up again after Warden Anita Trammel ordered the execution to begin. Earlier this month, Michael Lee Wilson, 38, was put to death for orchestrating a deadly assault on a convenience store worker in Tulsa in 1995 . 'I love the world,' he said. 'Love my daughters for me. I'm going to miss you always.' Within 20 seconds of the execution starting, Wilson's final words were, 'I feel my whole body burning.' He showed no physical signs of distress. Wilson's sister, Staci Wilson, sang a hymn throughout the execution, including the line, 'His soul is resting and it's a blessing.' When he was pronounced dead, she recited Psalm 23. Not forgotten: Michael Yost was a married 30-year-old father with hopes of being a store manager when he was brutally beaten to death by his co-worker Wilson and three others . After the execution, Wilson's mother, Patricia Taylor, stood to capture a final look at her son on the gurney as a curtain began to close, blocking her view. Wilson's fiancee sobbed beside her. Earlier in the day, he ate his last meal, which consisted of a stuffed-crust pizza with parmesan cheese as a final meal, along with a Cherry Dr Pepper, a pomegranate and cherry mash candy. Yost's family denied an interview request but issued a statement noting the third of three executions was behind them. 'Closure will be not hearing this on the news and reading about it in the paper,' the family said in a statement issued by Angela Houser-Yost, Yost's widow. 'That is my closure - not to relive his death over and over but to remember the good times.' Before the crime, the men loitered nearly an hour while waiting for customers to leave. Once they were gone, they struck Yost with an aluminum baseball bat 54 times in 131 seconds. They jostled a safe while removing it, but Wilson posed as Yost when a security company called to check an alarm. And to dampen suspicions among middle-of-the-night customers, Wilson put on Yost's uniform and worked the cash register as Yost lay dying in a pool of blood, beer and milk behind the cooler doors. The state Board of Pardon and Parole last month rejected Wilson's clemency request on a four to one vote. Ahead of the hearing, Assistant Attorney General Jennifer Miller told the panel that Wilson knew Yost had to die so he couldn't identify his robbers. Police trailed Wilson after he didn't show up for work later that day and stopped all four men in a car about 14 hours after the crime. They carried multiple rolls of $5 bills and had pairs of Nike Air tennis shoes with the price tags still attached. Accomplices: Billy Don Alverson (left), 39, was executed in January 2011 and Darwin Brown (right), 32, was executed in January 2009 . Wilson told officers that the four had planned for two weeks to rob and kill Yost, and a week before the killing even Yost knew something was up: He asked a police officer to increase patrols in the area because he believed Wilson and his friends intended to rob him. Life in prison: Richard J Harjo was sentenced to life because he was only 16 at the time of the murder . The assault was captured on the store's surveillance system - video of Wilson stuffing money in his pockets and audio of the bat striking Yost as he pleaded for mercy. 'The repeated sounds of the baseball bat striking Mr Yost and Mr Yost's screams will never leave my mind,' Tulsa Assistant District Attorney James D. Dunn wrote to the parole board. Dunn was a bailiff during the defendants' preliminary hearings in 1995. Yost, 30, had worked at the store three months. In small talk 14 minutes before the assault began, Wilson asked Yost what kind of future he thought he had with the company. According to a summary of the case by the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Yost told Wilson of his desire to manage the store some day.Wilson, who was 19 at the time of the killing, laughed at Yost's answer, and then replied, 'For real?' Darwin Brown, 32, was executed in January 2009, and Billy Don Alverson, 39, was executed in January 2011. The fourth defendant, Richard Harjo, who was 16 at the time of the crime and is now 35, was sentenced to life in prison. Wilson will be the 192nd person executed by the state of Oklahoma since statehood; 52 will remain on death row after Wilson's death. He is the first to be executed in the state in 2014.","Michael Lee Wilson was put to death by lethal injection in Oklahoma Thursday .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . A girl of two died in a fire started by a young boy playing unsupervised with a cigarette lighter. Libby-Jayne Hornsby and the boy were being looked after by other boys aged 12 and 15 while her mother was at a majorette marching band practice. Kelly Hambrey, 25, had left eight disposable cigarette lighters scattered around the rented house in Conisbrough, South Yorkshire – which was not fitted with smoke alarms – last October. Ms Hambrey had been practising with her majorette band when the fire started at around 7.20pm on October 17 last year. Libby-Jane Hornsby died from smoke inhalation when a fire was started in her home in Conisbrough, South Yorkshire by another child playing with a lighter, an inquest heard . The inquest heard how a child picked up a lighter left around the house and started playing with it in the room where Libby slept. Within minutes, a fire started on the bed and the room went up in flames . Neighbour Gary Keeling described seeing flames hitting the roof of the property as he tried to save the girl . A teenager had been hired to babysit Libby. The inquest heard there were five disposable cigarette lighters around the house, all within easy reach of children. Another child - who cannot be named for legal reasons - picked up one of the lighters and started playing with it, the hearing in Doncaster was told. Within minutes, a fire had started on the bed and the room was soon engulfed with flames and thick smoke. A neighbour tried to save Libby, the inquest heard, but couldn't get close to the bedroom. The child received 70 per cent burns, but was killed by 'thick and noxious smoke' A post-mortem examination carried out after the child's death revealed 70 per cent of Libby’s body had been burned in the fire - which experts believe would have burned at around 200 degrees Celsius. But it was the 'thick and noxious' smoke from the fire which killed the infant. A statement written by the teenage babysitter, who also cannot be named,  was read out in court. He said he had been babysitting for the mother for around two months while she went to band practice. Recalling the events leading up to the fire, the statement read: 'About 7.20pm [the child] ran downstairs and said there’s a fire. 'I ran upstairs, but couldn’t get close to the bedroom door. I could see flames hitting the roof so we ran outside and we heard a window crack.' Two neighbours were alerted to what was happening, and emergency services were called. Neighbour Gary Keeling tackled the blaze in a bid to save Libby, who was still trapped in the bedroom. Giving evidence, Mr Keeling said he made three attempts to get to the bedroom but could not tackle the 'thick wall of smoke' and the heat. He said: 'I could hear the burning; things cracking, things falling. But I could not see because of the smoke. 'Soot was falling down like snow on my bare flesh and it was quite painful.' Emergency services arrived shortly after and firemen, using special breathing apparatus, managed to pull Libby out of the house. She was immediately taken to Rotherham Hospital but could not be resuscitated. Recording an accidental death as a result of smoke inhalation, Coroner Nicola Mundy said: 'Within the property there were a number of disposable lighters. Libby's mother Kelly Hambrey, who was out practising with her majorette band when the fire started . Investigators work at the scene shortly after the tragedy in October last year. Libby was rushed to hospital following the fire, but could not be saved by medics . '[The child] was playing with one of those lighters and in doing so caused the bed clothes to ignite. 'The fire took hold very fast. As well as intense heat, this also produced thick and acrid smoke. 'Attempts were made to get Libby from the bedroom but it wasn’t until emergency services arrived that they were able to get her out.' Ms Mundy also raised concerns that there were no smoke alarms in the house and said she would write to the Chief Fire Officer’s Association about the fact there is no legislation which requires private landlords to provide the life-saving devices.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Of all the states in the nation, Maryland once again reported the highest concentration of millionaires, according to an annual survey conducted by a wealth research firm. A report released this week by the New York-based Phoenix Marketing International showed that there were just over 6million millionaire households in the nation - an increase of 53,000 from the year before. In other words, 1 of 20 households in the U.S. has more than $1million in investible assets, not counting the value of real estate. Spreading the wealth: Maryland was ranked No. 1 on list of states boasting the highest numbers of millionaires for third straight year thanks to 167,287 households with more than $1million in investibale assets . For a third consecutive year, the top spot in the rankings went to Maryland, where 167,287 households, or 7.7 per cent of all households in the state, boasted more than $1million in assets. Maryland is located in close proximity to Washington, DC  - ranked No. 10 on the list - and many of the nation's top statesmen, power brokers and wealthy lobbyists own homes there. For similar reasons, the capital's other neighbor, Virginia, was ranked seventh on the list of states boasting the greatest number of millionaires. New Jersey and Connecticut were ranked second and third, respectively, moving up one spot on the list from the year before. New York was ranked 12th for a sixth straight year, with just over 429,000 households reporting more than $1million in assets. Hawaii, which was dethroned in 2011 by Maryland as the state with the highest concentration of millionaires, in 2013 was in a fourth place, followed by Alaska - the only other state outside the northeast that made it into the top ten. Maryland is located near Washington, DC, and many of the nation's top politicians, power brokers and wealthy lobbyists own homes there . 'Most improved' state: North Dakota jumped 14 spots on the list from 43rd in 2012 to 29th last year due to an energy boom in the state . However, it was unpretentious North Dakota - a state few people associate with extreme affluence - that delivered the biggest surprise on the survey by jumping 14 spots from 43rd in 2012 to 29th last year. The Wall Street Journal reported that the 'Roughrider State' owed its stratospheric increase in the number of millionaires to an energy boom in the Bakken shale region. Maine and Louisiana also enjoyed a good year, climbing 11 and 10 spots in the rankings, respectively. But other parts of the country did not fare as well in the millionairesâ€™ department. Still feeling the pinch of the economic downturn, Nevada plummeted 20 points to No. 39, while Arizona, Idaho, Florida and Michigan all slid down in the rankings more than 10 positions.","Phoenix Marketing International reported there were just over 6million millionaire households in U.S. - up 53,000 from 2012 .

Stunning views: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will enjoy a night's stay at an exclusive resort in New Zealand as part of their three-week tour of the Southern Hemisphere, which starts next month . Getaway: Kate and Wills will spend two nights away from their seven-month-old son Prince George during their trip to New Zealand and Australia. Breaking with tradition, the couple will base themselves in three cities - Sydney, Canberra and Wellington - rather than travel from city to city each day . William and Kate have designed their high-profile visit on behalf of the Queen on what is known as a ‘hub and spoke’ model. Instead of hawking themselves from city to city, as is customary on overseas royal visits, they will base their young son in three cities: Wellington, Sydney and Canberra. The arrangement means they will be able to travel back to him at the end of each working day, bar two unavoidable stop-overs. Fortunately the view at their holiday spot is likely to take their mind off the distance. Priding itself as being the ‘perfect, private hideaway’, it has ten suites and villas, offering the royal couple complete seclusion. The entire resort has been booked out for their one-night stay. William and Kate are expected to reside in the owner’s cottage, which boasts a private balcony for guests to admire the views of a lake and mountain range from the depths of its own Jacuzzi. Styled by a leading local interior designer, it has a spacious main lounge, study, kitchen and dining room, as well as four expansive bedrooms with walk-in closets and in-room bars. Even the bathrooms offer uninterrupted views of the scenery. The main lodge itself boasts a luxury spa, infinity swimming pool and sauna and fitness centre. Royal base: Prince George will stay with his nanny at the royal base, and his parents will travel back to be with him each night, bar two unavoidable stop-overs . Room with a view: While staying at this exclusive bolthole, Kate and Wills  are expected to stay in the owner's cottage, which boasts a private balcony for guests to admire the views out over a lake and mountain range from the depths of its own Jacuzzi . The rate for the cottage, which includes pre-dinner drinks with hors d’oeuvres, a seasonal gourmet dinner and full breakfast, is normally NZ$12,750 – almost £6,500. Fortunately for New Zealand taxpayers, who are footing much of the bill for the tour, the lodge has been secured for a massively discounted rate of only a few hundred pounds for the night. The couple will arrive at the lodge after a day of engagements – including a wine-tasting at the Amsfield vineyard and white water rafting on the Shotover river – before flying to Christchurch the next day. That evening they will be reunited with George, who will stay at Government House in Wellington, where William stayed in 1983 during his own parents’ tour of the country. A source close to the duke and duchess said: ‘William and Katherine are hugely excited about the trip but made it clear from the start that they couldn’t bear to leave George behind. ‘They decided to model the tour on the way the Queen conducts hers. She tends to use one or two places as a base instead of moving from city to city, which also works for them with a young child. Cosy: To preserve the couple's privacy the entire resort, which is made up of ten suites and villas, has been booked up for the night, at a discounted rate . Restful: The couple will arrive at the lodge after a day of engagements - including a wine-tasting at the Amsfield vineyard and white water rafting on the Shotover river - before flying to Christchurch the next day for another programme of engagements before being reunited with Prince George in Wellington that evening . ‘They have managed to arrange it so that they spend only two nights away from their son and are keeping their fingers crossed that it will all work out OK. 'The only thing they are slightly concerned about is how George will cope with a 25-hour flight. They have warned people that although he is, generally, a really happy little boy, he might be a little bit grumpy the other end!’ Kensington Palace declined to comment on the location of the couple’s hotel for security reasons. But a spokesman told the Daily Mail: ‘The New Zealand government has secured accommodation at very substantially reduced rates, which are actually equivalent to the cost of a room in a local hotel.’ An aide said the New Zealand government and local tourist board ‘recognise the extraordinary and positive public spotlight the visit will put on New Zealand and we have taken their recommendation in relation to this accommodation’. On Thursday the couple returned from their first holiday without seven-month-old George, having spent a week at the five-star Cheval Blanc Randheli Resort in the Maldives. The Mail revealed that George, accompanied by a heavy security detail, was being cared for by his grandparents, Michael and Carole Middleton, at their home.","The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will jet off on a three-week tour of Australia and New Zealand next month .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Revenge porn: Blogger and mother of two Melissa Esplin was shocked to find herself on a 'revenge porn' website . Melissa Esplin is a blogger, a calligrapher and a proud mother of two - and if you believe everything you read on the Internet, she also poses for nude, sexually explicit photos on the Internet. Esplin is one of hundreds - if not thousands - of victims of a new extortion scheme where 'revenge porn' websites take innocent, fully clothed photos of women and crop their heads onto another woman's naked body. They then post the photos on their websites with the woman's full name, city and other contact information. If the woman complains, the owner of the website will often charge her a fee - oftentimes hundreds of dollars - to remove the photos. In Esplin's case, she didn't realize that her image appeared on a porn website until she woke up one morning with an inbox full of emails from men around the world propositioning her for sex. 'I was like, what's going on? This is kind of ridiculous,' Esplin told KSL. She was shocked when she found her photos and her contact information on a 'revenge porn' website - and even more shocked when some very PG photos she posted on the Internet had been turned into pornography with her face on the nude body of someone else. Esplin, who lives in Salt Lake City, Utah, with her husband and two young kids, contacted the website and asked that the photos be removed immediately. She says she was given the option to have the photos removed, but that she would have to pay $400. Happy family: Esplin says someone took innocent, fully clothed photos of her she posted on the web and cropped her face onto nude bodies . Blogger: Esplin runs a successful crafts blog and has uploaded several photos of herself onto her site - thinking they were safe . Esplin, who operates a successful craft blog and has an online calligraphy business, relies on the Internet for much of her livelihood. She says the 'revenge porn' phenomenon is something she'd never be a part of. 'That's not an aspect of the Internet that I ever interact with,' Esplin . told KSL. 'And it's just -- I hate seeing the underbelly of the . Internet.' She's also concerned that appearing on a porn website could hurt her business - as well as her reputation. 'The fact that possibly my name had been sullied and my name is my image and my image is my business,' she said. Take action: Esplin says anyone who finds themselves the victim of a 'revenge porn' scam should immediately call the FBI . Esplin has refused to pay the fee and reported the website to the FBI. However, because the site is registered overseas - and through shadowy companies - there isn't much the FBI can do. Stateside, Utah is one of many states addressing 'revenge porn' websites - an anti-revenge porn bill just passed in both houses of the state's legislature and is awaiting a signature from the governor. Other states with 'revenge porn' legislation in the works include Georgia, Tennessee and Florida. Esplin's advice to anyone who may fall victim to one of these websites: 'When it does happen, don't let it waste your time. Contact authorities, get on it right away and move on.'","Melissa Esplin was stunned when men from across the world started emailing her propositioning her for sex .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The man made famous last year by his 132-pound scrotum has died after multiple heart attacks. Wesley Warren Jr, 49, from Las Vegas, was hospitalized this week after complications from diabetes, he passed Friday after suffering two heart attacks while in treatment, a friend told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Warren shot to infamy after a TLC special showed a doctor removing his massive scrotum which enlarged because he suffered from a rare medical condition called scrotal lymphedema. Warning graphic content - scroll down for video . Passed away: Wesley Warren, shown before the surgery to remove his 132 pound scrotum, died Friday after multiple heart attacks . Doctors cited privacy laws in refusing to disclose the cause of Warren's death, but friend Joey Hurtado confirmed to the Review-Journal. 'He was in the hospital for five and a half weeks,; the friend told the paper. 'He had infections that I think were brought on by his diabetes and then he had those heart attacks.' Warren had been enjoying his new-found freedom in the year since his surgery until his hospitalization this past week, according to Hurtado. 'He had been in good spirits after the operation, traveled around in a new van he bought,' the friend said. 'We went on a trip to Los Angeles from Las Vegas and he was fine. I kept trying to get him to lose weight so he’d be healthier. He’d get depressed sometimes that he wasn’t healthier than he was.' His ordeal began when he woke up one . morning six years ago with a shooting pain in his groin which grew . steadily worse as his scrotum became steadily bigger over the following nine . months. Relief at last: A team of four physicians begin the procedure last year to remove the massive scrotum . Mr Warren was left barely able to walk and was often subjected to ridicule and abuse when he appeared in public. His . penis was buried so deeply in the abnormal growth that he was forced to . urinate on himself and he was forced to turning hooded sweatshirts upside down and using them as pants. At . one stage he became so desperate he considered selling his testicles on eBay to . pay for an operation to remove them. Fortunately, California doctor Dr Joel Gelman agreed to carry out the 13-hour operation to . remove it for free. Exam: Surgeons examining the swollen scrotum prior to the surgery which caused his weight to drop by 200lbs . Recovery: Warren in his hospital bed following the operation . Into the bin: The outsized scrotum being taken away on a trolley for disposal . The procedure carried out last April, had Dr Gelman and three other . physicians cut away simultaneously on the grossly enlarged protective . sack of skin and muscles that contained Warren's testicles and penis, . according to the Las Vegas Review Journal. The . massive swelling was caused by fluid building up in his scrotum. Doctors . had to remove the excess tissue and then completely rebuild his . scrotum. Despite finally being relieved of his burden, Mr Warren was initially unhappy claiming the surgery made his life a . misery because it left him with a one-inch penis. He said he would . never be able to have a relationship with a woman. But . finally, Warren is feeling optimistic about the future ahead of more . surgery later this month and has now revealed how he would one day like . to host his own talk show. A new man: Warren, left, shown with Dr Joel Gelman, who led a team of surgeons and nurses in the life-changing procedure . Struggle: Mr Warren needed a wheelchair to cart the scrotum along a hospital corridor prior to the operation . He told the Huffington Post: 'Talk radio is a longtime love,"" he says. ""And the past few years has given me an awful lot of practice. 'If my life is proof of one thing, it's that anything's possible.' 'It was the worst pain I ever felt in my life,' he told the New York Post. 'It got so bad one day that I stood in . my living room and cried. There was a fresh breakage of skin...and it stung to no end. 'I was expecting to be stared at — if you look like a freak you expect people to look at you like you’re a freak,' he said. Before: Wesley Warren spent five years of his life wearing hoodies as pants, with the hood carrying his enormous scrotum . Painful ordeal: Warren woke up one morning six years ago with a shooting pain in his groin which grew steadily worse, his scrotum became steadily bigger over the following nine months . 'I would only get upset when, every . once-in-a-while, some person with no manners would stare at me and start . laughing and give me that ""freak passing by"" look. 'That caused me . in the past to say a ""word"" or two with regards to rudeness. 'Besides, I was OK with the stares. That’s what I was . expecting.' Though he initially complained that he was 'still disfigured', he has since become more optimistic about his future. 'I can see a light at the end of the . tunnel, but I’m still in the tunnel.' The . extremely rare condition is much more common in Africa and Southeast . Asia, where it is caused by parasites, than it is in the western world. Miserable: Warren expected his life to be transformed after he had his 132 lbs scrotum removed, but he claims the surgery left him 'disfigured' Talking about his life before the . operation he describes himself as a prisoner to his testicles and that . the growth ruled his life. 'I could only walk in baby steps – I had to stop every 30 seconds,' he said. 'It . was just horrible. I couldn’t get in and out of a vehicle and even then . I fell down on to the pavement and it took four grown men to try and . lift me up.

"By . Ryan Gorman . An Ohio family is in mourning after an 11-year-old boy was accidentally shot dead Wednesday by his 15-year-old cousin. Ashton Nicholson, of Kent, was pronounced dead at the scene of his relative’s Franklin Township home, authorities said. The teen who shot the weapon remains unidentified because he is a minor. Authorities told NewsNet 5 that no charges will be filed against the 15-year-old boy, but police are looking into what laws may have been broken by the parents - who were not home - for not having the gun secured.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Associated  Press Reporter . Five years ago, former NFL player Donte Stallworth got behind the wheel of his car drunk: it is a decision he has always regretted. Stallworth served 24 days behind bars for fatally hitting a pedestrian, 59-year-old father Mario Reyes, in a drunk driving accident. Although the sentence was short, he believes living with the impact of his bad decision has been far worse punishment. On Friday, he marked the five-year anniversary of that horrific moment with a reflective post on Instagram. 'There's nothing I can do to reverse that day, but hopefully you guys will think of me and make better decisions than I did that morning,' he wrote in his Instagram post caption.

"By . Alex Greig . Identical triplets born to a Canadian couple three months ago have been diagnosed with the same, extremely rare form of eye cancer. Thomas, Mason and Luke Low are all suffering from retinoblastoma, a cancer so rare there are only about 20 cases diagnosed in Canada every year. Their parents, Richard and Leslie Low, noticed that one of the babies had an odd-shaped pupil, and following testing, were told that each of their tiny sons had retinoblastoma. Tiny things: The babies were born six weeks premature but appeared in perfect health . The Lows had moved Edmonton for Richard Low's medical residency with their two-year-old son Benson when they were given the news that Leslie was carrying not one but three babies. The chance of conceiving identical triplets naturally is about one in a million, and Richard and Leslie Low were surprised but excited about the prospect of being parents to triplets. A few months after the triplets were born, Richard noticed a strange change in Mason's eye. 'I noticed Mason had an odd pupil like a tear drop, I thought it was a little odd,' he told the Global News. 'I thought about it and talked to my friend who is an eye doctor, and he told me to take a picture with the flash and look for red reflex, and there was no red reflex, it was white.' Retinoblastoma: A photograph of the pupil of a child with the condition will show a white reflection, indicating the presence of a tumor behind the eye . Top medical care: The Lows meet with their eye specialist Dr Brenda Gallie (left) The Lows took Mason to a specialist who diagnosed retinoblastoma, a rare cancer that's most common in young children. The doctor then examined Luke and Thomas and gave the Lows the devastating news that they, too, had the condition. It turns out that the shape of Mason's pupil had nothing to do with the retinoblastoma, but were it not for Richard Low's curiosity, the cancer may have advanced to a much more dangerous stage before the boys were diagnosed. 'We obviously are devastated,' one of the Lows wrote on the family blog. 'My heart nearly shattered to pieces when I heard the news, but I am trying to put myself back together. There's no time to be brokenhearted when you have four beautiful boys to care for.' The family realizes their uniquely unlucky situation. Keeping the faith: Leslie and Richard Low say their faith, family and friends are getting them through this time . Baby joy: Despite their condition, the triplets are feeding and sleeping normally, say their parents . On their blog they wrote: 'Chances of marrying while at BYU [Brigham Young University], 1/3. Chances of having a boy, 1/2. Chances of having four boys in a row, 1/16. Chances of spontaneous identical triplets (no in vitro), 1/1,000,000. Chances of triplets having retinoblastoma, unheard of [sic]."" The condition is the result of a gene mutation that occurred before the egg split into three, resulting in all three boys having retinoblastoma. The family flew to Toronto for treatment, where they were given individual diagnoses for each baby. The Lows were told that Luke had 10 tumors scattered in both eyes, but located in the peripheral areas, not causing any central visual impairment. The tumors were treated with a laser. Mason had one main tumor in his left eye, along with smaller cancer cells that could develop into a tumor. He has been treated with localized chemotherapy and laser treatment to diminish the large tumor and prevent it growing any further. Recovering: Tiny Thomas Low after surgery to remove his eye . Doctors are hoping to save his left eye with systemic chemotherapy, which will be performed when he is slightly older. Thomas, who had the most serious case of the three, had a large central tumor that was too big to treat with laser or chemotherapy injection. The Lows had to make a quick decision to either try systemic chemotherapy, a risky treatment for a baby who weighs barely nine pounds, or to remove Thomas's right eye. Systemic chemo gave them only a 50 per cent chance of saving the eye, but could have resulted in hearing loss, kidney failure or brain cancer. 'All to save an eye that wouldnâ€™t see,' Richard Lows said. 'We decided to just focus on his good eye.' The Lows opted to have Thomas's right eye removed, which will help to strengthen his left into a 'super-eye.' Since his surgery last Friday, Thomas has recovered well. He has been fitted with a temporary prosthetic eye that will be exchanged for a more permanent one when he's older. 'You know, we have prayed for a miracle, and a miracle did happen,' Leslie Low wrote on the family blog. 'All babies have at least one really good eye. Prayers truly are being answered.' All three babies will need to be constantly monitored - every two weeks - for new tumors until the retina stops growing at around age two.","Canadian identical triplets all have a very rare form of eye cancer .
Thomas, Mason and Luke Low are only three months old but have undergone treatment for retinoblastoma .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap . The National Security Agency has been recording all of a foreign country's phone calls, then listening to the conversations up to a month later. The program is the latest revelation from a trove of classified documents that former NSA systems analyst Edward Snowden leaked to certain news organizations last year. Most of those documents have described . the U.S. collecting massive amounts of data and text. This program is . different in that it records phone calls. MYSTIC: The NSA has been recording and listening to every single phone call made in one foreign country . The NSA listening program was first reported by the Washington Post, which agreed to not identify the targeted country or other countries . where the program's use was envisioned by officials at the request of government officials. This NSA program dates to 2009 and is called MYSTIC, according to documents obtained by the Post. It is used to intercept conversations in one specific country, but documents show the NSA intends to use it in other countries, the Post said. It records all conversations across the unidentified foreign country and stores billions of them for 30 days. The program wasn't fully operational until 2011. One of the program's senior managers told the Post that MYSTIC is comparable to a time machine, meaning voices from any call can be replayed without requiring the NSA to identify a person before the conversations are collected. Leak: The MYSTIC program is just the latest revelation revealed by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden . The conversations swept up likely include those of Americans who make calls to or from the targeted country. Civil libertarians are concerned that this program and others like it will target other countries and that the NSA will eventually hold the data longer than what was defined its original charter and use it for other reasons. 'This is a truly chilling revelation, and it's one that underscores how high the stakes are in the debate we're now having about bulk surveillance,' Jameel Jaffer, American Civil Liberties Union deputy legal director, said in a statement. 'The NSA has always wanted to record everything, and now it has the capacity to do so.' The White House would not comment on the specific program described by the Post. But National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said information sought by the U.S. intelligence community is, in many cases, hidden in the 'large and complex system' of global communications. Thorn: The release by Snowden of secret documents on NSA spying practices has become an enormous thorn in the heel of the spy agency . 'The United States must consequently collect signals intelligence in bulk in certain circumstances in order to identify these threats,' Hayden said in a statement. She said the presidential directive that authorizes this type of collection 'makes clear that signals intelligence collected in bulk may only be used to meet specific security requirements.' The NSA is authorized to collect in bulk signals intelligence - the type of intelligence that comes from radio signals and communications, for example, as long as the purpose of the collection is to counter threats regarding espionage, terrorism, proliferation, cyber security, safety of U.S. troops and transnational crime. Bulk collection means collecting everything, even if some of what's collected has nothing to do with national security. Most of the conversations collected under the NSA program would be irrelevant, the Post said. 'Hero': While Snowden is despised by many in both the public and the government, he has become a hero to many who think the government oversteps its bounds with its surveillance practices . The NSA would not confirm the existence of the MYSTIC program. But a spokeswoman said that the NSA's collection programs are legal and done for national security purposes. 'NSA does not conduct signals intelligence collection in any country, or anywhere in the world, unless it is necessary to advance U.S. national security and foreign policy interests and to protect its citizens and the citizens of its allies and partners from harm,' NSA spokeswoman Vanee Vines said in an email. Vines said it jeopardizes national security when details about classified intelligence programs are made public.","The MYSTIC program is the latest revelation from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden .

"By . Associated Press . A southwest Ohio woman accused with her husband of abandoning the adopted nine-year-old son they raised since infancy pleaded guilty Monday to a lesser charge and received a suspended jail sentence, a prosecutor said. Lisa Cox and husband Cleveland Cox, of Butler County's Liberty Township, had been charged with nonsupport of dependents. The misdemeanor charge alleging that they recklessly abandoned or failed to provide adequate support for the boy could have resulted in sentences of six months in jail and a $1,000 fine for each of them. Lisa Cox, 52, and her husband Cleveland, 49, of Liberty Township, arrive for a hearing at Butler County Common Pleas Court at the Government Services Center in Hamilton, Ohio, on Wednesday . Lisa Cox pleaded guilty to the lesser misdemeanor of attempted nonsupport of dependents and received a suspended sentence of 90 days in jail, Butler County Prosecutor Michael Gmoser said. The charge against Cleveland Cox was dropped because jeopardizing the father's employment 'would not have been in the best interest of justice or society,' Gmoser said. The couple's attorney, Anthony VanNoy, did not immediately return calls to his office Monday. Authorities alleged the couple left the boy with children services in October after saying he displayed aggressive behavior and earlier threatened the family with a knife. Documents filed by the prosecutor say the parents didn't tell the boy when they left him on October 24 that he wouldn't be returning home. The boy was left with a bag containing some clothes and a handwritten letter from Lisa Cox in which she said that she loved him and would never forget him. Well-to-do: The couple live in this lovely neighborhood where the median income is around $100,000. They had raised their son since he was three months old . VanNoy said last week after a pre-trial hearing that the boy has gotten some much-needed help and the parents have been in counseling with him. VanNoy said the family's goal had always been to get help for the boy. Adolfo Olivas, an attorney appointed by . the court to protect the boy's interests, has said the emotionally hurt . and confused child is now receiving help that the parents should have . gotten for him. Gmoser said the mother's sentence was suspended conditioned upon her good behavior and continued cooperation with the county's children services toward reunification with the boy. Not a money problem: The Coxes live in this home valued at more than $330,000 home in Liberty Township . Threatening? Neighbors said the Coxes are good parents and people. One of them described the 9-year-old adopted boy as a 'bad seed.' The couple claims the boy has threatened them with a knife . Gmoser said he was encouraged by Lisa Cox taking responsibility and by the reunification efforts. 'I feel justice was served,' the prosecutor said in a telephone interview Monday. 'There was no justification for abandonment, but there were mitigating circumstances with respect to the frustration that the family was having toward the issues they were facing on a daily basis.' The prosecutor said he hoped the case would stand as a message and a deterrent to parents who seek to abandon their children in a similar fashion and would focus attention on issues raised by the case. People within the adoption community say they worry about emotional trauma to the child. They say giving up a child after so much time is rare and undermines the stability and commitment that adopted children need. The median annual income in the region where the parents live is more than $100,000, and the median home value is more than $280,000, according to census data.","Lisa Cox of Ohio pleaded was given a suspended jail sentence .

"By . Paul Bentley . Save the deer: A small but hardy group of protestors has tried to put a stop to the imminent cull . They are not the usual sort of people to be found protesting outside a nuclear plant. But when the Sellafield reprocessing site in Cumbria declared it would cull 12 deer caught on its land, a group of outraged villagers decided they could not stand idly by. Yesterday, 15 local protesters gathered on the grounds of the plant, waving placards in a call for nuclear bosses to show compassion to the animals. They carried flags, illustrations of deer and banners declaring ‘Free Sellafield deer’. Organiser Margaret Morton said: ‘It has been a peaceful protest. We would like them to move the fence and let the deer back out. Culling is not the answer. Our wildlife is precious.’ After Sellafield recently built two security fences at the site’s south perimeter, the herd of wild roe deer became trapped. Seeking advice from experts, Sellafield Ltd, which owns the plant, decided the most humane and practical course of action was to cull the animals. Planning to hire marksmen to shoot the deer, the company announced they would be killed by April. When locals found out about the plans, however, they got together to try to stop the cull. More than 1,500 people have signed a petition calling for the company to let the deer live and they are asking local Liberal Democrat MP Tim Farron to take the matter to Whitehall. Many of those who object are from the tiny neighbouring village of Seascale. Have a heart! The protestors called on the owners of the nuclear plant to free the deer into the wild . Causing a problem: The deer became trapped when two new security fences were erected at the plant . The local Parish Council has also strongly objected to the ‘unnecessary’ cull. Councillor David Ritson said: ‘This seems a quick, convenient and cheap fix for a problem for which there is another solution. Trapped: A roe deer (file photo) ‘Would it not be a better and more humane solution to temporarily remove one section of fence and herd the animals back into the natural environment?’ A local resident said: ‘I am thoroughly disgusted at the thought of Sellafield wanting to cull the roe deer by shooting them. ‘I have myself had the joy and thrill of watching these graceful, gentle animals, and to my mind they do not deserve this cruel and sudden death. Surely there is a way round the problem. They are part of our countryside.’ Kate Fowler, head of campaigns for Animal Aid, said: ‘This is a huge company that seeks complex solutions to difficult, dangerous problems as a matter of course – it cannot be beyond their wit to release a handful of deer.’ Sellafield Ltd said it had consulted wildlife experts, including the government-funded Deer Initiative, in making its decision. A spokesman added: ‘Their advice to us was that deer are animals which tend to run and hide when spooked. ‘The experts felt that the deer would try and hide deep in the thicket and cause themselves serious injury in doing so. ‘This decision has been taken with the medium- to long-term welfare of the animals in mind, and is neither the most convenient nor the cheapest option available to us.’ Defence: A spokesman for the plant (pictured) said it was neither the cheapest nor the easiest solution .","Herd of roe deer was trapped when the nuclear plant had new fences built .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Pop star Sting’s estate in Tuscany was renovated by workers linked to the mafia, Italian police said yesterday. Police arrested six people on Wednesday, in connection with renovation companies that carried out high-profile work in Tuscany, including the restoration of the famous Uffizi Gallery in Florence and Sting’s 900-acre estate in the Chianti hills. Part of the firms’ profits went straight to the Neapolitan mafia, it is alleged. The singer and his wife Trudie Styler  opened the estate to the public last year after renovation works were completed . Sting's 16th-century mansion, Il Palagio, features six cottages, a swimming pool, an outdoor chess board and a wine cellar. The estate produces its own wine, olive oil and honey. There is no suggestion the singer was aware of any alleged criminal action . The singer opened the estate to the public last year after renovation works were completed. Cottages can be rented for £5,800 a week each. The construction companies, Ggf . Construction and Pdp Construction, along with another company evaded . taxes for €10m (£8.3m) by filing fake invoices, to artificially inflate . their costs and lower their taxable income, police say. The . fabricated invoices were provided by eight other companies, closely . associated with the Camorra mafia. Investigators called them ‘paper . mills’ because their sole task was printing the invoices. ‘(They) could offer such (low) prices that honest companies could not compete, enabling them to obtain important public and private works,’ police said. There is no suggestion that Sting or any of the companies’ clients were aware of any illicit activity. As part of the operation, police also seized assets worth £9million.","Six arrested in connection with renovators who worked on property .

"By . Lucy Waterlow . This week The One Show presenter Alex Jones is taking on the task of scaling a 1,200ft high mountain in Utah. The Moonlight Buttress in Zion National Park is infamous in climbing circles for its difficulty. It will take Alex two-and-a-half days to ascend and at night she must (attempt to) sleep dangled from the sandstone rock face in a mini tent. She won't be able to wash, go to the toilet without tubing or rest for long on the gruelling climb which challenges even the most advanced climbers. Toppled by nature: Alex stands in front of a coconut tree which hangs in the twisted steel roof of a school destroyed by the typhoon . Still smiling: Alex meets children who survived the tropical cyclone last year . Devastation: Alex looks at a ruined building that was once a school . Lives destroyed in an instant: Homes and businesses were wiped out by the natural disaster . Alex, 36, admits she'd only climbed a ladder, and maybe a tree as a child, before taking on this ordeal. So just what made her agree to take on the arduous climb? She was inspired following a trip earlier this year to the Philippines to see how money raised by Sport Relief is helping people whose lives were destroyed by Typhoon Haiyan. The tropical cyclone killed thousands of people and left many survivors homeless after it tore through  South East Asia last November. Alex travelled to Tacloban, the Filipino city worst hit by the typhoon, to witness the destruction first hand. Homeless: Alex with Delia and her daughters outside of the cramped structure in which they have been living since their homes we swept away . Rebuilding: The presenter helped with a project to create new homes . Silver lining: The wood from coconut tress felled by the natural disaster can be used to make new homes . Where the money goes: The building is made possible thanks to support from charities . She told MailOnline: 'Amongst all the devastation and . destruction that the Typhoon Haiyan left in its wake, perhaps the most . visually striking is the coconut trees which were felled. 'As we arrived the number of these . giant trees which had been ripped from the ground by the combined force . of the wind and storm surge wave that fateful day in November began to . hit home. 'A nearby school roof had been crushed by an 80 foot . tree which was still suspended there. Other classrooms looked like a . bomb site - even reinforced concrete walls had been ripped apart.' While Alex was shocked by the devastation but was further alarmed when she learnt of the human suffering the typhoon caused. Many farmed had replied on the uprooted trees for a living so now had no source of income. Getting stuck in: Alex was happy to help with the house building . New start: Delia and her family will be able to move into a more comfortable wooden home . Other families had their entire lives wiped out by the force of nature. Alex explains: 'I was introduced to Delia and her two . beautiful daughters, Fatima, 14, and Salvacion, 10. The typhoon hit . almost a year to the day after Delia had lost her husband to illness and . their house didn't stand a chance â€“ washed away, along with everything . they owned, in an instant. An entire lifetime's worth of possessions, . care and love just gone.' She added: 'Since then the family have lived in a . makeshift tent-cum-shack cobbled together with corrugated iron sheets . they found strewn around. 'Inside, conditions are indescribably awful. Supplies they have managed to get from the relief effort take up most of . the meagre space and the three of them are forced to sleep curled up in . a ball.' But thanks to the way Sport Relief is helping aid agencies like Oxfam and Save The Children, Delia and her family have now been given a new home that Alex helped to build. She said: 'The only positive to be gleaned from the 30million trees that were damaged or destroyed was that, with so many homes obliterated too, these fallen giants provide a . ready supply of lumber for the rebuilding programme.' Challenging climb: Alex is currently in Utah and begins her ascent today after a few practise runs, right . Precarious: At night, Alex will sleep in this suspended bed . Delia's new home was created using freshly cut timber from one of the uprooted trees. Alex picked up a hammer and attempted to make herself useful where she could but left the majority of the work to the experts. She said it was heartwarming to see how much the new structure meant to Delia and her daughters. 'As their new home began to take shape the excitement and emotion on Delia and her girl's faces was plain to see and as soon as the roof was on they began to move what possessions they had in,' she said. 'To see the transformation in a single day was astonishing. Life won't be easy for Delia and her family of course, and in time they will need a more permanent, stronger home than this, but compared to where they had spent their lives since the typhoon it was heaven and the joy they felt as they moved in was written all over their faces.' After seeing how money donated to charity has made such a difference, Alex is now determined to raise as much money as she can through her mountain challenge. She said she'll keep the plight of those like Delia was in mind when the going gets tough. She said: 'It's sometimes easy to wonder if the money given in the wake of huge natural disasters like Haiyan ends up where you want it to. It doesn't get more tangible or useful than what I witnessed through chainsaws, nails, wood and expertise coming together to make the world of difference. 'The trouble is that there are plenty more families waiting for that kind of miracle to happen to them, which is why I've chosen to dangle from the edge of a rock face - hope my climbing skills are a bit better than my DIY ones!'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Actor John Nettles has criticised the BBC for cancelling re-runs of Bergerac . John Nettles criticised the BBC yesterday for cancelling re-runs of Bergerac – because they feature a children's home linked to Jimmy Savile. The 1980s detective series used Haut de la Garenne – dubbed the Jersey House of Horrors – as police HQ. A child abuse investigation found that former residents had been molested. Savile visited the home and it is feared he abused youngsters there. BBC2 said it had postponed re-runs of the show because of 'the sensitive nature of the public hearing into incidents at Haut de la Garenne'. Nettles fumed: 'It seems to be a little bizarre that exterior Haut de la Garenne shots can't be used. It means you can't photograph or film anywhere where there is a suspicion that a crime has been committed. 'It just shows how far the BBC is bending over backwards to apologise for the Jimmy Savile scandal. 'How it can be connected by viewers with Jimmy Savile and the Yewtree inquiry is beyond belief. It's just unfortunate that viewers have to suffer for it.' The Haut de la Garenne home, which was unoccupied at the time, featured as a police station in six of the show's nine series. BBC2 bosses had planned to re-run the entire back catalogue of Bergerac, which ran from 1981 to 1991 and made Nestles, who played Jim Bergerac, a household name. But after running the first three series, corporation chiefs have 'postponed' the remaining six, which all feature Haut de la Garenne as the fictional HQ. A fresh inquiry looking at allegations of abuse in children's homes and fostering services in Jersey from 1960 to the present day is due to start this year. The former Haut de la Garenne children's home in Jersey has been the subject of a major child abuse investigation. It was used as a police HQ in Bergerac . A spokesman for the BBC said: 'Due to the sensitive nature of the public hearing into incidents at Haut de la Garenne and out of respect for the victims, the BBC has decided, for the moment, to postpone episodes of Bergerac.' Haut de la Garenne began in 1867 as an industrial school for 'young people of the lower classes of society and neglected children'. It closed in 1986 and was the centre of a huge police inquiry in 2008 which revealed numerous instances of child abuse against past residents. It led to the conviction of a former resident and a former member of staff.","Series used Haut de la Garenne on Jersey as a police HQ .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Russian president Vladimir Putin has got in touch with his cuddly side as he prepares to host the Winter Olympics in Sochi. Putin - known for being a tough, rugged outdoorsman - visited a preserve for endangered Persian leopards at Sochi National Park today. He visited a group of cubs born last summer - one of which he lifted onto his lap and stroked. Scroll down for video . Cuddling up: Russian president Vladimir Putin is pictured stroking a Persian leopard at Sochi National Park . 'We've decided to restore the population of the Persian leopard because of the Olympic Games,' said Putin. 'Let's say that because of the Olympic Games, we have restored parts of the destroyed nature.' During his trip, Putin entered one of the leopard's cages and stroked the animal on the back of the head - before declaring: 'We like each other'. However, the president did not feel the same about the local media, who apparently upset the big cat, which scratched one of them on the hand and bit another on the knee, according to Russian news agencies. Close encounter: He visited a group of cubs born last summer - one of which he lifted onto his lap and stroked . Event: Putin's visit was designed as a show of environmental consciousness ahead of the Sochi Winter Games. Above, the Bolshoy Ice Dome (left) and Adler Arena Skating Centre, which will be used during the Games . Putin's first step on the Olympic stage was designed as a show of environmental consciousness ahead of the Sochi Games, which open on Friday. The leopard preserve was established at the park, situated between seaside Sochi and the Alpine venues in the towering Caucasus Mountains, five years ago as an Olympics-related project. Some of the new leopard population is to be released next year in hopes of repopulating southern Russia, where they became extinct in the 1970. The former KGB operative has thrown open the Kremlin treasury to finance the Olympics, lavishing a record $51 billion on sports facilities and transportation infrastructure in the resort city on the Black Sea coast. Tough: Putin - pictured riding a horse in a Russian mountain range - is known for being a rugged outdoorsman . Enjoying the sun: The Russian president fishes during a mini-break in his country's Siberian Tyva region . He has gambled big on the games, determined to host an event in a fashion befitting his image of a newly powerful Russia that is a global economic and political power. Putin drove to the reserve in an SUV, with two International Olympic Committee (IOC) officials riding in the back seat. Later today, the Russian leader was due in Sochi to address the IOC. With the vast sum Putin invested in the Games, he has turned the once-sleepy resort into a kind of Disneyland of phantasmagorical structures - new highways, sweeping overpasses and top-notch sports venues. Winding roads and rail lines were cut upward into the mountains to newly built Alpine facilities. Energetic: Putin drove to the reserve in an SUV, with two International Olympic Committee (IOC) officials riding in the back seat. Above, the president, who is a judo black belt, swims in a lake in Siberia's Tuva region . While the massive project doesn't represent a do-or-die moment for Russia, the most expensive Olympics in history - with billions of dollars reportedly lost to graft - will still reverberate through the economy and Kremlin politics. Putin's third term as president will end in 2018. Official business: Putin was due in Sochi to address the International Olympic Committee alter today . What's more, the games are being shunned by President Barack Obama and key European leaders. The U.S. leader, in open protest of new Russian anti-gay laws, dispatched an official American delegation made up of three openly gay athletic greats - former tennis star Billie Jean King, 2006 Olympic hockey medalist Caitlin Cahow and figure skating wizard Brian Boitano. Former Homeland Security chief Janet Napolitano leads the delegation. Top officials from Olympic heavyweights, including Britain, France and Germany, also won't be in Sochi. The paucity of national leaders of major world powers leaves Putin with a schedule of meetings that will begin on Thursday with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and Chinese President Xi Jinping. On the following day, he will sit down with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Japanese leader Shinzo Abe. No Western-aimed diplomacy is scheduled. While Putin stepped in in Syria to convince leader Bashar Assad to turn over his chemical weapons - therefore saving Obama from having to initiate airstrikes - the White House remains angry that Russia have given asylum to Edward Snowden, the contract worker who has leaked volumes of secrets about U.S. intelligence-gathering efforts.","Vladimir Putin visited endangered Persian leopards at Sochi National Park .

"By . Jack Doyle . Vicky Pryce walked free from prison yesterday – and promptly announced she had signed a book deal. Miss Pryce promised the book, which will be published later this year, would be ‘more than a memoir’. She said it would include her account of the two months she spent behind bars for perverting the course of justice by taking her ex-husband Chris Huhne’s speeding points. 'More than a memoir': Vicky Pryce arrives at her home in Clapham, South London, yesterday, where she told waiting reporters she had signed a publishing deal for a book about her time behind bars . The book, Prisonomics, will be published in hardback and sell for £16.99 a copy. Miss Pryce, 60, kept a diary while in jail and was pictured carrying a distinctive notebook. She said the book would cover her views on the prison system and how it treats women. But readers will no doubt be more interested in the prospect of further revelations about her relationship with the former Cabinet Minister. But any profits from the book, which will be published by Biteback, could be seized by the authorities. Under laws which came into force in 2010 as part of the Coroners and Justice Act, police can seize the proceeds of books seen to be ‘exploiting’ an offender’s criminal past. Critics urged the authorities to examine the case closely. Peter Cuthbertson, director of the Centre for Crime Prevention said: ‘Many people will find it distasteful for a criminal to announce a book deal on the day she is released. ‘Self-serving memoirs by former prisoners are nearly always a bad thing. 'They are offensive to victims of crime and often glamorise the criminal lifestyle, leading some to believe crime is the route to respect and wealth.’ Ambitious: Miss Pryce, 60, kept a diary while in jail and was pictured carrying a distinctive notebook. She said the book would cover her views on the prison system and how it treats women . Yesterday a spokesman for her publisher refused to comment on what subjects the title would cover, saying ‘she hasn’t written the book yet’. Her first book, Greekonomics, was about the economic crisis. After Lord Archer was freed in 2003 after serving two years for perjury, he is believed to have made £15million from a three-book deal for his prison diaries. Shamed former Cabinet minister Jonathan Aitken reportedly received an £80,000 advance for his autobiography, Pride And Perjury, after he was released in 2000.","Vicky Pryce promises her forthcoming book will be 'more than a memoir'

"By . Rob Cooper . Laura Farrell, 41, (pictured) died in the car crash after Sherri Torkington ran a red light . An angry woman driver killed a wife in a car crash while driving 'aggressively and recklessly' following a screaming row with her boyfriend, a court heard today. Sheri Torkington, 32, was so angry she jumped a red light at speed and hit Laura Farrell's car as the victim was taking her husband to work in the early hours of the morning, a jury was told. Mrs Farrell, 41, a HSBC bank worker, suffered fatal injuries in the accident in Bolton, Greater Manchester, and died at the scene. Her husband Norman, 52, was left with a broken neck, nine broken ribs, a broken collar-bone, three fractures to his pelvis and a punctured lung. In the minutes before the crash, a witness told the court she saw Torkington 'shouting, screaming and yelling' at her boyfriend Philip Holt at 3am. The defendant then allegedly got into her Ford Fiesta and drove 'recklessly and aggressively' before crashing less than half an hour later. 'We say the row she had had contributed to the reckless way in which she drove afterwards,' said Darren Preston, prosecuting at Bolton Crown Court. 'This defendant drove a Ford Fiesta through a traffic light which was on red and had been on red for some seconds, at a major and complicated junction, without slowing down or apparently looking at all. 'We say that was driving well below that which would be expected of a reasonable and careful driver and was therefore dangerous. 'Her driving caused a collision between her car and another car, driven by Laura Farrell, which had proceeded through a green light from another side of that junction. 'That collision was of sufficient force that, unfortunately, Laura Farrell lost her life. It was, we say, the dangerous driving of this defendant which caused her death.' Joan Haslam told the court she woke up on the day of the tragedy, June 29, 2011, to see Mr Holt arguing with a woman for around 10 minutes. Seriously injured: Mrs Farrell's husband Norman, 52, suffered a broken neck in the crash.  Torkington, 32, right, denies causing death by dangerous driving . She said they were shouting at each other although she did not know what they were saying. Mr Preston said: 'She heard shouting and screaming coming from outside. She looked out her window and there she saw a male and a female. 'We say that the female was Holt's girlfriend, the defendant. Mrs Haslam saw her get into the car after Holt walked off and she drove off at speed.' A second witness, Shaun McGuinness was also at home in bed and heard the argument. He also recognised Mr Holt and also saw the woman speeding off in her car, not slowing down as she drove through the residential street and on to the main road. The prosecution lawyer added: 'It is clear from this evidence we see that the defendant was angry and aggressive because of the argument she had had she was driving aggressively and recklessly as a result.' Mrs Farrell was in her black Ford Focus taking her husband to work at a cheese distribution factory where he worked night shifts. Tragedy struck at 3.25am at the junction on Turton Street, Bolton with the A666 St Peters Way . Mr Farrell who had been in a relationship with Laura for 23 years, but were only married for seven added: 'Laura took the car out of gear, coasting up to the lights which were on red - we must have been travelling at 10mph. Torkington drove like she was on a 'suicide mission' before ploughing into Mrs Farrell's car at Turton Street, Bolton (pictured) 'The lights started to change as we were about 10 to15 metres away from the lights. I looked to the right and by the time I looked left all I could see was grey and a crunching noise and that's all I remember.' Mr Farrell woke up in Bolton Royal Hospital to be told his wife had died in the crash. He was in hospital for over a month and now has abscesses on his brain, liver and lung. He told defence lawyer David Toal that although he was running late for work, his wife was not speeding . 'It's not a possibility that the lights were red. She was the perfect driver', added Mr Farrell. Another witness, Robert Johnston, who saw the collision as he was cycling home from his shift at a bakery in Horwich, said he saw the black car, driven by Mrs Farrell, proceed through the green light.' He said he then saw Torkington's car arriving suddenly, driving at around 35-45 mph, coming straight through the red light in the middle lane and smashing into the victim's car. Torkington's car pushed Mrs Farrell's vehicle into the crash barrier and then spun into the middle of the dual carriage way. The cyclist flagged down a taxi and an ambulance was called. When police arrived, Torkington was still in her vehicle, slumped over the steering wheel but came to screaming her name and that her legs were hurt. Torkington, of Bolton, who only started driving in September 2010, later denied being angry at the time of the crash. She told police she had watched Mr Holt play pool at a pub, before heading to another. They returned home around 10.30pm and had a 'minor disagreement' after which she drove him to his daughter's house. She said that as she approached the traffic lights, they were on amber. Torkington denies causing death by dangerous driving. The trial continues.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A teenage girl from Houston, who told her parents she was spending the night with a friend, was found with a 31-year-old man she had met online. The girl, who has not been named, was spotted with Robert Tyler Patrick, when police pulled their car over in the early hours of Saturday. Patrick claimed to be taking the girl to stay with family in San Antonio, but . the teenager told police she was going to Patrick's apartment, after meeting him on social network, Whisper. Stopped: Robert Tyler Patrick has been charged with soliciting a minor after traffic police found him with a 16-year-old girl . Several bags and a suitcase belonging to the girl were found in the car, and Patrick claimed he was helping the teenager because she had been thrown out of home. But, when police called the girl's parents, they told officers their daughter hadn't been thrown out and that they believed she was staying with a friend. They also said they were unaware their daughter had been seeing Patrick, who is nearly twice her age. Patrick had been pulled over by police in Tomball because he had an expired registration sticker. He later admitted he had been having an 'inappropriate relationship' with the teenager, the Houston Chronicle reported. The teenager claimed they had met through the social networking app Whisper, which allows users to anonymously post messages and pictures, and also send private messages. A police statement sent to Mail Online states that the teenager told police the pair had communicated online, sharing messages and pictures, for a few days before agreeing to meet in person. On the day police stopped them, the girl said she had arranged to go to Patrick's apartment. Claims: Patrick is accused of pretending to be a 17-year-old boy when the pair chatted on the Whisper App .

'She had done nothing to provoke the office,' the page said. 'She died immediately.' Brown, who did not witness the incident, added to KFOR: 'He turned back to the animal control . officer and said, ""Did you see the way her collar flew into the air when I blew her head off?

"By . Laura Williamson . Arsene Wenger has given his clearest indication yet that he will sign a new deal at Arsenal. The Frenchman has been at the helm since 1996, but has repeatedly stalled on agreeing a new three-year contract at the club before his current agreement runs out at the end of the season. But, speaking ahead of Saturday’s Barclays Premier League clash at home against Fulham, Wenger insisted any uncertainty over his future would not complicate Arsenal’s negotiations in the January market. No news: Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger says the club are not close to any transfers as the club announced a deal with Huawei as the Official Smartphone Partner, the Arsenal boss is seen here with Mark Mitchinson . Not a fan: Wenger says he would love to scrap the transfer window . He said: ‘There is always a point . where you have to decide, of course. There is a point where you have to . decide and there is a point where you have to make your decision public. You can take that sentence the way you want it.’ However, . the Arsenal boss admitted he needed to convince supporters his squad . could compete again for the highest honours. The capture of £42million . signing Mesut Ozil last summer, he believes, was crucial in that . process. ‘People were . questioning whether I could deliver quality,’ said Wenger. ‘My . commitment has never been a problem. I am convinced I can. ‘This . question is not about me, it’s more about “Do people believe Arsenal . can compete?” The fact we bought Ozil in at top-level money has turned . belief around. ‘I would . have loved to (sign a player like Ozil earlier). But I would have loved . first to keep the players we had. We were not capable of doing that.’ All smiles: Per Mertesacker, Laurent Koscielny and Olivier Giroud share a joke during training . Down to business: Giroud has a serious face on as he competes for the ball with Semi Ajayi . Eyes on the ball: Mesut Ozil controls the ball during training while Kieran Gibbs runs during training . Wenger . said he is ready to bring in ‘another special player’, but that the . club are not close to signing Schalke’s Julian Draxler. There . were suggestions this week that Draxler, 20, had been spotted at . Arsenal’s training ground, but Wenger joked: ‘That’s like a . non-identified flying object. Some see them everywhere.’ The . Arsenal boss is enjoying life at the top of the table and admitted this . season has been much easier, psychologically, adding: ‘When you are in . our position today it is natural motivation and there is incitement to . go further.’ Meanwhile, . Arsenal are also looking to secure new deals for defender Per . Mertesacker and full-back Bacary Sagna, the France international who is . out of contract in the summer. Wenger said: 'We are making good progress and hopefully we can announce something soon.' My ball: Lukas Podolski  keeps the ball from Serge Gnabry during training . Keep ball: Per Mertesacker, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Kieran Gibbs during training . 'Are we close to signing anybody? At the moment I would say no.' Wenger added: 'The transfer market in January is a low key transfer market. 'There is very reduced activity (generally). There will be some of course, but in the last three days as always.' Arsenal have also been linked with Fulham forward Dimitar Berbatov. Wenger said: 'Do I rate Berbatov as player? Highly. Have we made any approach to sign Berbatov? No. 'I . don't think (we would look to sign Berbatov) because we have (Nicklas) Bendtner who is coming back, we have Yaya Sanogo who is making very good . progress in training. 'Of . course we have lost Theo Walcott and that for us was a big blow. Hopefully we can compensate, but we have not made any approach (for . Berbatov).' Targets: Wenger says Arsenal are not close to signing Julian Draxler are unlikely to move for Dimitar Berbatov . Wenger would rather do away with the whole mid-season transfer window. 'You have my signature straight away,' he said. 'Either you scrap it completely, or you leave it open until as long as possible to the last four games. 'It is like running a relay, then in the middle of the relay you change your runners.' Wenger said: 'It gives teams a chance who are already convicted, it gives some teams hope. 'But when I arrived in England, the window was open until April, the whole season, and it was not a problem.

Former TV judge Joe Brown was dragged from a Memphis juvenile court hearing on Monday after the presiding magistrate found him in contempt for inciting the courtroom crowd. Brown reportedly worked the courtroom into a froth as he questioned the authority of the magistrate while he was there representing a client in a child support case. 'He all but had that courtroom in a riot,' said Juvenile Court Chief Magistrate Dan Michael. According to WREG, the fight was sparked after Brown was told there was no record of the case he was there to plead.

"By . Alexandra Klausner . A New York Jets player was arrested outside of a New Jersey Target in November for illegal possession of synthetic marijuana. A recently released incident report reveals that police were contacted because a woman thought she saw the player masturbating. An incident report from the evening on November 19 shows that a woman called police at 5:30 pm  after she saw Jets tight end Kellen Winslow Jr. sitting in his black Cadillac Escalade outside an East Hanover Target with his erect penis exposed. She told police she thought he was 'masturbating' 'As she exited her vehicle, she commented to the male regarding how cold it was,' the police report said, reports the Star-Ledger. Winslow was arrested in November fro smoking synthetic pot and new reports show police were called because a woman thought she saw him masturbating . 'As she stood near the open driver side window of the Escalade, she observed the males (sic) erect penis. She stated that she believed he was masturbating. (The woman) provided a written statement regarding her account.' When police arrived, an officer saw Winslow 'slouched over in his seat and moving around.' When an officer approached the car, Winslow seemed startled and told the officer he was looking for a Boston market but was lost, reported NJ.com . Even though Winslow's genitals 'were not exposed' when the cops arrived, there were two open containers of vaseline found in h car along with synthetic weed called 'Mr.Happy' and 'Funky Monkey.' Police noted that Winslow was wearing 'dark colored sweatpants' and said that Winslow claims he was changing in his car so as not to smell like smoke when he got home. He said he liked to smoke synthetic weed in his car to relax and said that the NFL does not test for the drug. After his vehicle was searched was allowed to go home free. Cops discovered two containers of open Vaseline in Winslow's car when he was arrested . Winslow's reps claim that 'nothing inappropriate' happened in the parking lot in a statement that they released on Friday. 'Kellen pulled over to a parking lot to smoke what he thought at the time was a legal substance,' Denise White of EAG Sports Management said on her Twitter. 'He changed his clothes in his vehicle as to not smell like smoke when he returned home. There was absolutely nothing inappropriate that took place and if there was police would have investigated further and charged Kellen which they did not. This will be the only time we will comment on this unfounded and ridiculous claim.' Lab test results came on Dec.23 and confirmed that Winslow was smoking synthetic marijuana. Winslow was charged on December 30 and pleaded not guilty. He was not tried for anything related to lewdness even though it was in the report. CBS reports that Winslow was suspended for four games earlier in the season for performance enhancing drugs. He claims his allergy medication is to blame for the positive test results. He signed a one-year, $840,000 contract with the Jets before the season making him an unrestricted free agent who can sign with any team he wants.  Winslow is a 9 year veteran with 469 career receptions. Winslow is married to his wife Janelle and has two children named Jalen Maximus Winslow who he had in February 2011, and a daughter Juliana Arielle Winslow, born in August 2013.

"By . William Turvill . These black-and-white photographs show the residents of a long-isolated island off the east coast of the United States. Inhabited by the descendants of slaves, Daufuskie Island is just three miles from the U.S. mainland, but the island has no bridge and had no electricity until the 1950s. The pictures were taken by Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe, the wife of the late tennis player Arthur Ashe, during visits to the island between 1977 and 1981. This is one of the photos taken by Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe on visits to the long-isolated Daufuskie Island . The 'time capsule' of 61 photographs has now been donated to the Smithsonian Institution . The isolated island, which does not have a bridge to the mainland, had no electricity until 1953 and telephones came to the island in 1972 . The ‘time capsule’ of 61 photographs has now been donated to the Smithsonian Institution, where they will sit in the African-American history museum. At the time the photographs were taken, 84 Gullah/Geechee people lived in isolation on Daufuskie Island near Savannah, Georgia, and Hilton Head, South Carolina. The island had a co-op store, a two-room schoolhouse and a church, and inhabitants supported themselves by catching oysters and growing cotton. Ms Moutoussamy-Ashe said she observed a pure and simple life. At first, she didn't pick up her camera because she wanted to get to know the people, and she developed a strong connection with them at a time before new development began to creep in. ‘My intent at 25 was to photograph what I saw as a dying culture, but at 62 now, I really see it was probably quite presumptuous of me to think that people wanted that,’ she said. It was an honour, she said, to give these direct descendants of slaves a place in an African-American museum. 'A shrimper and his son' is one of the photographs included in the collection, taken between 1977 and 1981 . The island, inhabited by the descendants of slaves, has no bridge to the mainland and did not have electricity until the 1950s. There were 84 people living on the island when Ms Moutoussamy-Ashe visited . This photograph shows a modern-day Daufuskie Island located just three miles off the U.S. mainland . Prior to the arrival of European explorers in the 16th century, native Indians lived on Daufuskie Island. The island was occupied by Union soldiers during the civil war and freed slaves (Gullah people) then inhabited the island. The isolated island, which does not have a bridge to the mainland, had no electricity until 1953 and telephones came to the island in 1972. According to the island’s museum, the population shrank to below 100. In the 1980s, land facing the Atlantic was purchased and development began on the island. ‘To give this just incredible, warm, giving, nurturing community of people recognition that they were able to thrive as long as they did, that to me is a testament to them and to our culture,’ she said. Museum director Lonnie Bunch said the donation, from the Bank of America, builds on a growing collection of photographs in the museum's collection, which also includes early images of Frederick Douglass and the work of South African photographer Gordon Clark. ‘Daufuskie Island is one of those places that was almost a time capsule,’ Mr Bunch said. ‘It was very important to capture that. That's what these photographs do.’ Merrill Lynch, now part of Bank of America, purchased the Daufuskie Island collection in 2007, and the images have been exhibited at museums in New York, Atlanta, Houston, Charleston, South Carolina, and Los Angeles. ‘This is a very special culture, one that has kind of stayed intact, captured by Jeanne as it was in the '70s,' said Rena DeSisto, the bank's head of global arts and culture. ‘But what she's captured is what it also looked like in the 1870s.’ The island had a co-op store, a two-room schoolhouse and a church, and inhabitants supported themselves by catching oysters and growing cotton when these black-and-white photographs were taken . Daufuskie Island, pictured here in modern times, had fewer than 100 inhabitants when Ms Moutoussamy-Ashe visited . The bank has an art collection of about 10,000 works and lends items free of charge to museums for about ten to 12 shows a year. The bank has been supporting the Smithsonian's black history museum since its earliest stages of development, Ms DeSisto said. After years of planning, about 30 per cent of the museum building is now completed on the National Mall. Exhibits have been designed, and curators are narrowing down what will be put on display first. The museum is also working to create about 130 media pieces, including video installations. So far, $410 million has been raised for the $500 million project, with Congress contributing half the funds. Oprah Winfrey is the project's largest individual donor, contributing $13 million. The Smithsonian's goal is to open the museum in November 2015. But trouble with water in an underground structure took additional time and could push the completion date into early 2016, Smithsonian officials have said. The photographer said it was an honour to give these direct descendants of slaves a place in an African-American museum .

"By . Meghan Keneally . Understanding a killer: Lee Harvey Oswald was the suspected assassin but he was killed by nightclub owner Jack Ruby before he could ever be put on trial . A young journalist had the run-in of his career on the day of President Kennedy's assassination but he didn't even know it. Pierce Allman was a rookie reporter when he accidentally ran into Lee Harvey Oswald in the moments immediately after President Kennedy was shot. 'He didn't appear stressed in any way,' Allman said of Oswald. Allman was in the crowd when shots were fired at the President's motorcade, and he saw people leaning out the fifth-floor windows of the Texas School Book Depository and looking up to the level above. 'There were three guys in the fifth floor window. And they were literally hanging out of the window and looking up and pointing up,' Allman told CBS. 'I thought, ""I need to get to a phone and call."" So I ran down the sidewalk and up the steps and into the doorway of the depository building.' As soon as he got into the building, he realized that he needed help finding a phone in the building so he could file the report. 'There was a guy standing in the doorway, and I said, ""Where's the phone?"" And he jerked his thumb and said, ""In there!"" And I said, ""Thank you,""â€™ he told CBS. The moment was so fleeting that even though Oswald's picture was splashed across the papers and television news programs in the coming days, Allman did not realize that Oswald was the man he spoke to until three weeks later. Scroll down for video . Then: Pierce Allman was a young reporter at the time of the assassination and as soon as he heard the gunshots he ran to the nearest phone to file the report . Now: Allman, seen looking at the Texas Book Depository, ran into that building because he thought he saw someone fire from the sixth floor, not knowing he actually bumped into that man on his way in . Looking back: At the time, nothing about Oswald's behavior concerned Allman . Allman was contacted by the Secret Service as they were combing through the police interviews Oswald had given before being shot on November 24. 'They said, ""Are you familiar with the testimony of Lee Oswald after his arrest?"" And I said, ""No."" And they said, ""He states as he was leaving the depository building, a young man with a crew cut rushed up, identified himself as a newsman, and asked where a phone was. So this was very obviously you,""â€™ Allman said of his interaction with the agent. Another journalist with incredible timing was Maurice Carroll, who was working as a stringer in Dallas for The New York Herald-Tribune in the days following Kennedy's assassination. Carroll was one of the reporters in the crowd waiting outside the basement of the Dallas police station, waiting as Oswald was being escorted for a transfer. Today, Carroll reveals that he likely . was the one to say the last words that the suspected assassin ever . heard, saying: 'How about it, Lee?' 'There . was no answer from Oswald as he was hustled forward by Detectives Jim . Lavell and B.H. Combest to a sedan that was backing into position to . pick him up,' Carroll writes, according to an article on Capital New . York. Final words: Fellow journalist Maurice Carroll said that he shouted out to Oswald saying 'How about it, Lee?' just seconds before Jack Ruby shot Oswald in the stomach . Fatal ride: President Kennedy and First Lady Jackie were in the back of the open-top convertible during their drive through Dallas on November 22, 1963 . 'Suddenly, a form flashed past UPI photographer Frank Johnston in the front row, Detective Combest, a vice squad member, recognized Ruby and saw Ruby pulling the .38 caliber from a jacket pocket. '""Jack, you son of a bitch,"" the detective said. 'The slight smile on Oswald's face vanished and his mouth opened. There was a ""pop"" kind of sound, and a cry of anguish from Oswald as his manacled hands clutched at his abdomen. He slumped, but was supported by one of his guards before he could hit the ground.'","One young reporter was standing in the crowd to watch the motorcade when he saw shots fired out of the Texas Book Depository .

"A D.C. woman has been assigned a medical guardian after making thousands of calls to 911 over three decades and being its most frequent user. Superior Court Judge Erik P. Christian approved the move on Monday for Martha Rigsby, The Washington Post reports. Christian called Rigsby's calls a 'serial, excessive and unwarranted' burden on the city's emergency services. It is thought to be the first case in which city officials have tried to limit a 911 user. Scroll down for video . Martha Rigsby is seen here getting into a car in this November 2013 file photo. Rigsby is the most frequent D.C. 911 caller in the history of the city . A November 2013 report linked Rigsby, pictured, to 226 calls to 911 and 117 ambulance rides in a 12-month period . Rigbsy, 59, was known in the 1980s as 'Metro Martha,' the paper reports, because she frequently fell at D.C. Metro stations. She usually suffered seizures or fainting spells. A fire department official told the paper in November 2013 that Rigsby was linked to at least 226 calls to 911 and 117 ambulance trips in the past twelve months. According to that report, Rigsby owes $61,366.33 to D.C. Fire and EMS for ambulance rides. Each trip in the past five years averaged $478. Since then, she has taken approximately 30 ambulance trips. Superior Court Judge Erik P. Christian, pictured, called Rigsby's calls a 'serial, excessive and unwarranted' burden on the city's emergency services . Rigsby and other frequent 911 users are often nicknamed 'frequent fliers.' Rigsby fell in a courthouse less than minute before her case was to begin in January, the paper reports. She said that she tripped on her cane. Firefighters who responded allegedly knew Rigbsy and called her by her first name. District witness Abayomi Jaji, a psychiatrist with the Department of Behavioral Health, said Rigsby could not care for herself because of bipolar and borderline personality disorder, plus conversion disorder. Christian's ruling, however, noted that Rigbsy can take of herself in many ways. She pays bills, bathes and dresses herself, and is able to arrange rides to medical appointments, the paper says. Rigsby's guardianship allows oversight for her medical decisions but not legal or financial affairs. The guardian will reportedly be able to recommend a home aid and arrange medical appointments. Private insurance will likely Rigsby's expenses.","Martha Rigbsy called D.C. 911 'thousands of times' over three decades .

"By . Sam Webb . Loss: Meredith Kercher, who was murdered in 2007 in Perugia, Italy. A coroner has concluded she died 'unnaturally' Exchange student Meredith Kercher was unlawfully killed, a coroner has concluded, nearly seven years on from her murder in Italy. In a brief hearing at Croydon Coroner's Court in south London, coroner Dr Roy Palmer said Miss Kercher met her death 'unlawfully' at her home in Perugia, Italy, over the night of November 1 and 2 in 2007. Her throat had been slashed. 'She died, the autopsy tells us, as a result of haemorraghic shock from stab and incised wounds to the vasculature of the neck. I do conclude that she was unlawfully killed,' said Dr Palmer, senior coroner for the south London area. 'On the night of the first and second of November 2007 Meredith was found in her bedroom at a residence in Perugia, Italy. It was clearly an unnatural death. 'Three individuals were arrested and tried. One male was convicted and did not appeal. 'The other two were convicted and appealed and the present position I believe is that there are further proceedings currently in Italy.' None of Miss Kercher's relatives were present for the five-minute hearing. 'The family I think are keen for closure and after all these years later I can bring some closure by completing the inquest and inquisition,' the coroner added. Coroner's Office manager Barry May said he had liaised with Miss Kercher's brother, Lyle, who had spoken to family members, and they were 'content' for the proceedings to take place in their absence. Amanda Knox, pictured cycling in Seattle. She recently had her guilty verdict reinstated at Italy's highest court for the murder of the Leeds University student . Italy's highest Court of Cessation ruled in March 2013 to overturn the acquittal of Knox and Raffaele Sollecito for the 2007 murder of Meredith Kercher . An inquest had to be opened in this country because Meredith, known to family and friends as Mez, suffered a 'violent and unnatural death.' In January Amanda Knox, 26, and Raffaele Sollecito, 29, had their guilty verdicts reinstated at Italy's highest court for the murder of Leeds University student Miss Kercher. Knox was sentenced to 28 years and six months while Sollecito was jailed for 25 years. The pair were originally found guilty of murder in 2009. Amanda Knox attends her appeal hearing to reconsider her guilty verdict in the murder of Meredith Kercher at Perugia's Court of Appeal in 2011 . They were cleared nearly two years later - when Knox returned to the US - but the appeal court ordered a fresh trial last March. Prosecutors claimed that Miss Kercher, of Coulsdon, Surrey, was the victim of a drug-fuelled sex game gone wrong but the defendants have consistently protested their innocence and claim they were not in the apartment the night she died. Rudy Guede, a drug dealer, is serving a 16-year sentence over the death, though the courts have said he did not act alone. Knox has refused to go back from America for the hearing saying they would have to drag her 'kicking and screaming.' Last month it emerged 27-year-old Guede, an Ivorian, has been allowed out on day release after just six years to study. Earlier this year Miss Kercher's sister Stephanie said the victim 'had been forgotten' in the media storm surrounding Amanda Knox. She added her family had struggled to keep their memories of her alive when press coverage of her murder focused on another person. 'Everything that Meredith must have felt that night. Everything she went through. The fear and the terror and not knowing why. She didn't deserve that. No one deserves that. 'We all definitely want some sort of closure. Just having an end of the Italian justice system and knowing that's the final decision, and then we can start to remember just Meredith,' she said. Speaking of when she last saw her sister alive as she prepared to study in Italy as part of her Leeds University course, Ms Kercher said: 'She was very excited about coming to Italy, looking forward to learning about Italian culture. Rudy Guede (left) was sentenced to 30 years in prison in 2008. Amanda Knox's former lover Raffaele Sollecito is appealing the re-convictions, with the case due to be heard by Italy's Supreme Court by early 2015 . 'Seeing the city of Perugia and making new friends. She really fought to be here. She wanted to be here. 'We were just talking on the sofa and having a little cuddle of goodbye and I just remember her suddenly crying and saying that she was going to be sad to go but she was excited to come and I remember being quite taken aback and I thought, ""Don't make me sad. I'll miss you but you'll go and have fun"",' she said. Ms Kercher's brother Lyle also spoke of struggling to cope with his sister's death and said of the new guilty verdicts: 'It's not the end of it. It's another chapter moving things forward.' 'Anybody losing anyone close is hard, losing someone so young and the way we did is obviously 100 times worse, and on top of that to have all the media attention that has gone for so long makes it very difficult to cope with.'","Coroner Dr Roy Palmer said the death was 'clearly unnatural'

"By . Emma Glanfield . Professor Pier Righetti caused a stir after using this image to illustrate his research into coconut proteomes in his Journal of Proteomics . A top Italian professor has been accused of sexism after using a picture of a naked woman holding coconuts to cover her modesty in a paper about protein research. Professor Pier Righetti caused a stir after using the image to illustrate his research into coconut proteomes in his Journal of Proteomics. The photograph features a blonde woman who is smiling while standing seemingly naked and holding the tropical fruits to protect her modesty. The Italian, a distinguished scientist, captioned the image with: ‘Here is your coconut woman, as perhaps envisioned by Harry Belafonte. For its proteome, though, have a look at the report inside!’ Journal publisher Elsevier took to its Twitter page this week following complaints from members of the public that the image was ‘sexist’ and ‘inappropriate’ and confirmed the photograph had been removed. Responding to messages on its social media page, the publisher wrote: 'They are inappropriate and are now being removed.' The issue came to light after Rajini Rao, a fellow professor, expressed her dismay at the pictures. On her Twitter page, @madamscientist, she posted a link to the journal and wrote: ‘A new low for graphical abstracts. Inappropriate image and inane highlights. Did I mention sexist too?’ She told her 383 followers she was writing to the professor and the publisher to urge them to take the image down. However, a day later she posted a picture which was apparently a response from the under-fire Milan-born professor. It read: ‘I wonder if you have been . trained in the Vatican. As you claim to be professor of Physiology, let . me alert you that this image is physiology at its best!’ The email was signed off with: ‘Take Care, Prof. Dr. Pier Giorgio Righetti’. Italian professor Pier Righetti, pictured, came under fire from members of the public after using the image in his  Journal of Proteomics. Publisher Elsevier has since confirmed the image was 'inappropriate' and removed it . However, Professor Righetti told The Times newspaper he felt under attack by the response to the racy picture. He said: 'The world is full of Talebans like those who destroyed with cannon fire ancient heritage in Afghanistan. He also added: ‘We try to invent graphical abstracts which are different,' before confirming ‘there is no sexism’ in any images he has used to illustrate his works.","Prof Pier Righetti used image to illustrate research into coconut proteomes .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . An anonymous Twitter account which enraged parents in Long Island, New York, after it started posting incriminating photos of drunken teenagers in uncompromising positions has been suspended. The account, @LIPartyStories, had encouraged teens to send in photos taken at house parties which typically consisted of kids misbehaving by drinking alcohol, throwing up, fighting, posing naked or lying passed out. The parents of Nassau and Suffolk counties were outraged last week when they learned of the account, which quickly amassed more than 25,000 followers. Scroll down for video . Incriminating: The Twitter account that has been reposting pictures of Long Island teens underage drinking has been suspended . Wide reach: Teens were taking snaps of themselves and sending them to the account which in turn retweeted the pics to more than 25,000 followers . Not suitable behavior: Many Long Island parents were concerned that the pictures could get in the way of their children getting into college or getting a job . Unsurprisingly, the pictures were not the kind of images that any parent would want to see of their child posted online. 'Kids do stupid things. We've probably all done stupid things, now you've got social media to be able to publish to the world how dumb you are forever,' Port Washington parent Peter Winick had told CBS New York when the account first gained public attention last week. Images posted to the account ran the gamut from a fairly innocuous shot of two girls shotgunning beers to students stripping for no apparent reason. Since teens have been underage drinking since the dawn of time, the resulting images are pretty unsurprising. Other posts included several students peeing in unconventional places like a sink or the corner of a dining room. Drunk stories: Some of the pictures were fairly innocuous, like the girls on the left shotgunning beers, or the picture on the right of two boys showing up to the party with a cheetah statue . Sick: But others were more concerning, like the several shots of high schoolers throwing up. This girl made it into a waste bin - many didn't . When you gotta go, you gotta go: Many of the high-schoolers didn't have the patience to wait for an empty bathroom . When the photographed teens had had too much to drink, they usually ended up either throwing up (sometimes successfully making it to the toilet, and many times not), or passing out. Those that made the mistake of falling asleep before everyone else, were usually subjected to such pranks as being surrounded by beer bottles or drawn on with a pen. In addition to concerns about the teens' health, local parents were also concerned that the pictures could come back to haunt their children when they apply for colleges or for jobs. Tired: When the teens had had too much to drink, they usually passed out before finding a bed . Don't move! This teen is in for a surprise when he awakes from his drunken nap . Shouldn't have gone to sleep: The girl who passed out in this photo had crude images scrawled on her face and arm including the phrase 'This is what friends are for' Marg Lee works for DEDICATEDD, a nonprofit organization that educates teens about the dangers of drinking and driving. 'Once it’s out in cyberspace there’s no taking it back,' she told CBS. 'If an employer is going to be looking for someone to represent their company you’re not going to want somebody that’s been all over the web.' Before bowing to pressure to suspend the account, the owner had maintained that all they were doing was giving people 'a good laugh.' 'Listen, we simply made this page for something kids can look at and have a good laugh,' the unknown account owner had previously told the New York Daily News. 'The pictures we post are pictures we are being sent.'","The person behind @LIPartyStories has bowed to pressure from parents and the media and suspended the controversial Twitter account .

"By . Associated Press . A man who managed to dodge police for two decades by hiding in his native Bangladesh, after carrying out a killing in Indiana, has been sentenced to 40 years in prison after being of the run for almost a quarter of a century. Mahfuz Huq, 47, expressed remorse and cried before a packed courtroom as Steuben County Superior Court Judge William Fee handed down the maximum sentence under a plea agreement. Huq, a naturalized U.S. citizen, pleaded guilty in November to voluntary manslaughter in the August 9, 1989, fatal stabbing of 19-year-old Todd Kelley at the victim's home in Hamilton, about 30 miles north of Fort Wayne. Kelly was seen as his 'romantic rival' in the murder that took place almost 25 years ago. A reformed character? Mahfuz Huq, now 47, (left) murdered a love rival in 1989.  He was 23 at the time of the murder (right) and fled Indiana for his native Bangladesh where he stayed until he was caught on a trip to India . How it happened: In the late 1980¿s Huq and Todd Kelley (pictured) were both interested in the same woman.  Huq stabbed Kelley to death in Kelley¿s Hamilton home in 1989 and then fled to his native country of Bangladesh for more than 20 years . After the slaying, Huq left the U.S. and lived in Bangladesh, where authorities were unable to reach him due to extradition laws. He was arrested in India in February 2011 when he arrived in New Delhi to take part in a table tennis training camp and was returned to Indiana last July after fighting extradition. In exchange for Huq's guilty plea, . prosecutors dismissed charges of murder and intimidation as well as a . six-count burglary case. Kelley's . body was found by his girlfriend, Christine Mutzfeld, who had been in a . previous relationship with Huq. Court documents said cigarette butts at . the murder scene indicated Huq waited for Kelley outside Kelley's home. Huq, . who was 22 at the time, was charged with murder two weeks after the . slaying. At the time, Huq already was accused of threatening to kill . anyone who dated his former girlfriend. A . report by an Indiana State Police technician said Kelley was first . stabbed in the back and it appeared he was 'taken by surprise.' The case was featured on the television programs 'Unsolved Mysteries' and 'America's Most Wanted.' 'I think for a case that’s 25 years . old, we feel okay about him getting 40 years,' said Shannon Kelley, . sister to Todd, their father.  'It’s at least the beginning of the end . of a very long process for us'. The . courtroom heard two very different sides of Huq Monday afternoon.  In . Bangladesh, he had been a dedicated middle school math teacher at the . International School of Dhaka. Friends . and co-workers flew in from as far as Africa and China for the . sentencing.  They testified about his care for the students, his . charitable work in an orphanage, and his enthusiasm in coaching high . school tennis. Huq, known to . them as Asif Haque, was traveling to India with the tennis team in 2011 . when authorities arrested him at a New Delhi airport.  It floored those . who were with him. Huq was eventually extradited back to Steuben County in July. Closure: Father Vern Kelley, left, and Todd Kelley's sister, Shannon, right, say they are happy with the 40-year sentence . 'You can’t blame those people.  They did the very best for what they could do to tell everybody what they thought he was,' said Vern Kelley, father to Todd.  'But obviously he was not what they thought.' On the other hand, the Kelley family spoke of 25 years of heartache for what they called a vicious and brutal crime.  Todd Kelley’s aunt told Huq, 'Today you will be sentenced, but you sentenced this family to a lifetime of heartache. 'I'm just relieved,"" Vern Kelley, Todd Kelley's father, says outside the Steuben County Courthouse after the sentence was handed down. ""You could feel that he was going to get some kind of justice that we felt was just. Monday would have been Todd Kelley's mother's birthday, Todd's sister Shannon Kelley says. 'I hope this is the best present ever,' Shannon Kelley says. Huq addressed the Kelley family in court, asking for forgiveness and wishing he could turn back time.","47-year-old Mahfuz Huq fled to his native Bangladesh more than two decades ago .

Mary Virginia Jones walked out of Century Regional Detention Facility in Lynwood around 11 p.m. Monday and was met by joyful family and friends, the Los Angeles Times reported. Jones was convicted of first-degree murder, kidnapping and robbery and sentenced to life without parole for a killing committed alongside boyfriend Mose Willis, who died while on death row. She always maintained that the abusive Willis forced her at gunpoint to help him rob and shoot two drug dealers, one of whom died. Law students at the University of Southern California's Post-Conviction Justice Project took up her cause. Scroll down for video . Hooray: Friend, Patricia Elder, left, hugs Mary Virginia Jones, 74, Monday night who was serving life without parole for her role in a 1981 murder, and was freed from prison . Huge moment: Jones, pictured, walked out of Century Regional Detention Facility around 11 p.m. to big hugs from family and friends, who shared tears and laughter . Jones expected to be shot and killed and . the subsequent trials did not take into account her history as a . battered victim, the justice project's directing attorney, Heidi Rummel, . told the Times. Los Angeles County prosecutors . conducted a new investigation and agreed to accept a plea of no contest . for involuntary manslaughter. Judge . William C. Ryan ruled Monday afternoon that Jones had served well over . the 11-year maximum sentence for the lesser crime and ordered her freed. Her family praised the Lord and sobbed after the judge issued his ruling. Jones, . using a magnifying glass to help her see, read her plea in court . Monday: 'I did not willingly participate in this crime, but I believe . entering a no contest plea is in my best interest to get out of . custody.' Freed: 74-year-old grandmother Mary Virginia Jones was released from prison late on Monday after spending 32 years behind bars for a murder that was actually committed by her abusive boyfriend . Outrageous: Jones was a church-going, devoted mother when she was subjected to four separate trials before finally being put in prison . Deputy District Attorney Hyman Sisman said he would not comment on the investigation except to say 'justice was done.' Jones' daughter, 53-year-old Denitra Jones-Goodie, told the newspaper her . mother always believed that someday she would be released. 'She's got strength on top of strength,' she said. The murder for which Jones was imprisoned so long, was actually committed by her abusive boyfriend, Mose Willis, and she was forced at gunpoint to drive to the spot where he murdered a drug dealer. On . Monday, judge tossed her first degree murder conviction after Jones . pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in exchange for her release. Cries of 'Thank you Jesus!' and 'hallelujah' rang out as the Los Angeles judge spoke the word 'released' on Monday morning. It was a word that Jones' friends and family--who all call her Mother Mary--thought they'd never hear. It marked the much deserved end to a saga that spanned decades and put a victim of abuse through four separate trials, including a reversal on appeal because the court failed to properly instruct the jury and excluded evidence of her duress defense and two hung juries. Jones was charged in 1981 along with her abusive boyfriend Willis, who kidnapped two drug dealers and forced Jones to drive to an alley. There, Willis killed one of the men as Jones fled for her life, expecting to be murdered as well. Instead, she was discovered at a friend's home and arrested days later. 'She knew this day was coming': Jones' daughter Denitra Jones-Goodie, pictured Monday, described to reporters the heartache she's gone through leading to this day . Challenge: UCLA law students successfully challenged Jones' 1982 conviction, saying the jury would never have convicted her had they heard expert testimony on what was then known as Battered Woman's Syndrome . Students . in USC's Post-Conviction Justice Project challenged the conviction on . the argument that had the jury heard testimony on the effects of what . was then known as Battered Women's Syndrome, she never would have been . convicted. 'The . procedural history of Mary's case gave me a greater appreciation for the . pitfalls of the justice system,' said UCLA law student Laura Donaldson. 'After first learning that it took four trials to convict Mary, I was . shocked and even more motivated to get her out of prison. I am so happy . that Mary will finally get the justice she deserves.' According . to Jones' lawyers, a week prior to the crime, Willis shot at Jonesâ€™s . daughter and threatened to kill both of them if they went to the police. 'He . pulled a gun on me and shot at me, and my mother witnessed that,' said . her daughter Denitra Jones-Goodie. 'And he threatened to not only kill . me but to kill her and anybody else that came to our aid.' Jones . was a church going employee of the Los Angeles Unified School District . and devoted mother before she met Willis, who was homeless at the time. She . was taken in by his promises he was looking to live a 'clean life' just . months before the crime and has since paid the price. Willis died on death row. Thanks to the help of the UCLA students, Jones has been reunited with her family. 'She never should have been incarcerated in the first place, but she's free, thank God,' Jones-Goodie said. 'It . has not been the same for any of us, me in particular, since my mother . has been gone...I really felt as though I had lost a part of my being.","Mary Virginia Jones walked out of Century .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Most toddlers would face some stern words if they spewed profanities. But you would be hard-pressed to discipline this adorable little boy who grins cheekily as he rattles off his limited range of expletives. Clutching a paper cup, and wearing a dinosaur t-shirt, it is slightly shocking to hear him say 'c**p'. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Adorable: Clutching a paper cup and wearing dinosaur pyjamas, he looks around cheekily as he starts his list . He is responding to his uncle asking what rude words he knows, and starts strong with 'c**p' But then, looking shiftily around, he unleashes his next: 'shut up'. He then reels off a list of words prefaced by 'butt'. 'Butt head, butt hole, and butt crack,' he blurts out, smugly smirking after each one at the prospect of breaking the rules. He continues: 'Butt nose, butt face, butt head, butt...crack? Butt ear, butt mouth, butt teeth...butt head...' 'Shut up' is his next expletive, before launching into a comical list of 'butt' words, including 'butt ear' He stares bluntly at the camera as he unleashes 'butt head' for the third time in his somewhat limited list . His uncle, filming, starts to chuckle at the seemingly endless variations on words featuring 'butt'. Finally, to round it all off, he lets out an unexpected: 'Sh**'. It takes his uncle by surprise, who bursts out laughing. The video has delighted YouTube viewers - although some took to the comment section to blast it as irresponsible. Stumped, he pauses, before saying 'butt ear, butt mouth, butt teeth' and again: 'butt head' He looks slightly baffled at his uncle chuckling away as the seemingly endless list goes on . But he sends his uncle into fits of giggles by concluding the performance with a defiant 'sh**' Some fawn over the adorable child, with one writing: 'This kid is amazing'. Another wrote: 'So innocent, and then the end!' One wrote, 'awww so cute!' while another said: 'I only can hope my child will be as versed and familiar with the English language as your son.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . At first sight it looks like nothing more than a fallen leaf, brittle and brown with a few insect bites taken out. But closer inspection reveals that the piece of foliage is in fact a cunningly camouflaged insect which has managed to blend in with its jungle surroundings. Seconds after its hiding place was disturbed, the animal - a sort of grasshopper known as the leaf katydid - spreads its wings to reveal vibrant autumnal patterns on the inside. Disguise: The insect, which was found hanging on a tree in the South American country of Suriname, is able to camouflage itself by mimicking a leag . Uncovered: The insect, which was disguising itself against a leaf, revealed its more vibrant wings when disturbed . The insect was found blended into its . surroundings in the Sipaliwini region of Suirname, a South American . country north of Brazil. It was noticed by American photographer Piotr Naskrecki, who took the pictures after making the lucky find as he travelled across the continent. He said: 'If you ever visit a humid, tropical area in South or Central America you may be rewarded with the discovery of one of the most amazing animals - the leaf katydid. 'The only way to notice them is to look for the movement of their long antennae and legs as they slowly munch on leaves at night.' Mr Naskrecki added: 'These katydids are probably the best mimics of plants among all insects. 'Look for the antennae': The leaf kaydid . 'Their mimicry is by no means restricted to resemblance of plain, green leaves - that would be too easy. 'When the insects fall to the ground, they often play dead when approached by a predator.' 'Their bodies are replicas of leaves that have been chewed up, torn, rotten, dried up, partially decayed, or covered by fungi. But the best part is that no two individuals are alike.'","Leaf katydid insect - a type of grasshopper - can disguise itself as a leaf .

"By . James Rush . A Scottish mountaineer who lost his hands and feet after developing severe frostbite while stranded in a blizzard which claimed the life of his friend has attempted to climb one of the most dangerous peaks in the Alps. Jamie Andrew, of Edinburgh, had his limbs amputated after he and his climbing partner Jamie Fisher became stranded in a violent blizzard at the top of a mountain in the French Alps 15 years ago. The pair were exposed to the elements for five days as they remained stuck on an icy ledge with no food or water. Attempt: Jamie Andrews (pictured training for the initial attempt to climb the Matterhorn in 2011) has attempted to climb one of the most dangerous peaks in the Alps . Mountaineer: Mr Andrew (pictured during his attempt to climb the Matterhorn in August 2013) had his limbs amputated after he and his climbing partner became stranded in a violent blizzard at the top of a mountain in the French Alps 15 years ago . Mr Andrew was eventually rescued by helicopter but Mr Fisher had tragically frozen to death by the time they were found by the rescue services. Mr Andrew was rushed to hospital with hypothermia where surgeons amputated his limbs due to the severe frostbite. However, with the help of his prosthetics and physiotherapy, the 44-year-old learned to walk again and has since taken part in triathlons and marathons. He has now taken on his biggest challenge by returning to the Alps region to attempt to climb the 14,692ft high Matterhorn mountain. He said: 'The Matterhorn is actually just the wrong kind of climbing for me. If it was a bit steeper I could get my arms on to the rock and climb quickly.  If it was less steep I could use my trekking poles and walk upright. 'As it is, I have to stumble from rock to rock, balancing as best I can, lunging with my arms to stop myself teetering back on my prosthetic legs. Incredible journey: Mr Andrew learned to walk again with the help of his prosthetics and physiotherapy. He has since taken part in marathons and triathlons before he returned to mountaineering .

Difficult climb: Mr Andrew (pictured during his attempt to climb the Matterhorn last year) said: 'Hopefully I have done my part to push back the boundaries of what disabled people can achieve' Preparation: Mr Andrew and his climbing partner Steve Jones plan their strategy for climbing the Matterhorn . 'It’s back-breaking work. The terrain is incredibly broken and it is impossible for me to keep up any pace. 'But if there’s one thing I’ve learned in life it’s that bravery is not always about taking tough challenges, but about taking tough decisions.' Mr Andrew was initially due to take on the challenge before last year, but the attempt had to be cancelled after his partner Roger Payne, one of Britain’s leading climbers, was killed in an avalanche in 2012. Mr Andrews' journey will be shown by Channel 5 next month in their film The Limbless Mountaineer. He said: 'Hopefully I have done my part to push back the boundaries of what disabled people can achieve, and Channel 5’s The Limbless Mountaineer is an edifying documentary about the journey.'

"By . Dan Bloom . It was a simple mission: to build a half-eagle half-horse robot. But creating Buckbeack the Hippogriff was hardly magical for the artists who airbrushed thousands of goose and chicken feathers one-by-one before piecing them together with tweezers. The animatronic beast is receiving his first makeover since a team of 20 took four months to create him for the Harry Potter films 12 years ago - and this time is proving just as challenging. Finishing touches: Val Jones tweaks Buckbeak's beak before he goes on display at the Warner Bros Studio Tour . Looking sharp: Val Jones (right), who made Buckbeak the Hippogriff, has talked about how it took a team of 20 artists four months to make his coat with thousands of hand-painted feathers from chickens and geese . Intimidating: The famously haughty animal becomes loyal to Harry Potter in the third book in the series . Star treatment: Buckbeak has his feathers buffed, preened and replenished by Val Jones . The magical creature with the wings and head of an eagle and body and tail of a horse featured in the third book of JK Rowling's series, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Harry and Hermione free the haughty Buckbeak - sentenced to death for attacking a pupil - and he helps Harry's outlaw godfather Sirius Black escape a similar fate. Cover star: Buckbeak featured in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban . Film costume expert and 'featherologist' Val Jones, who made the original creature, has been drafted back in to recreate one of the books' most popular animals. She told MailOnline: 'Buckbeak was one of the most challenging creatures I’ve ever worked on. 'It took almost a year and a team of 20 to build three versions of him. We worked closely with mechanical engineers to replicate the exact wing movement and skeleton of a real bird. 'Each version required thousands of feathers to be sorted, dyed and then individually glued in place by hand. 'As . the Buckbeak on show [in London] is more than 12 years old now, it’s . important to refresh and replenish his coat as the glue wears and . feathers come loose when he bows.' Buckbeak’s coat consists of thousands . of real goose and chicken feathers, which were individually airbrushed . with dye and then hand-glued with a spatula onto a net underneath. The models were mechanically fitted so the wings, neck, eyes and . beak could all move. In other scenes, the Hippogriff was created digitally and the cast were given props such as a beak . on a stick with which to interact on set. Ms . Jones, who also worked on Fawkes the phoenix and Hedwig the owl, said . despite her experience Buckbeak - who is the size of a real horse - took . another three months to replenish. Loyalty: The film version of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban starred Daniel Radcliffe . Magical: The bird appears in Hagrid the gamekeeper's pumpkin patch but is sentenced to death for an attack . Painstaking: Ms Jones said she had to paint the feathers individually and put them in place with tweezers . Project: The magical creature has the wings and head of an eagle and body and tail and hind legs of a horse . Some of the feathers on Buckbeak's wings are even more complex, as they were made out of plastic using a mould. Ms Jones added: 'I’ve worked in the industry specialising . in fur and feathers for over 30 years working on a range of films from . 101 Dalmatians, Willow, Labyrinth, The Witches, Indiana Jones and the . Last Crusade and Babe.' The model is being re-feathered and preened for the Warner Bros Studio Tour near Watford, Hertfordshire. Holders of an £89 family ticket will be able to see Ms Jones and her team live at work from April 4 to April 27. The eight Harry Potter films grossed an estimated £4.6billion at box offices worldwide - with hundreds of millions more in DVD sales and merchandise.

"By . David Mccormack . In Chicago they're rightly proud of their deep-dish style of pizza and so the city recently had a public vote to determine which restaurant served up the best. The winner by an impressive margin was Lou Malnati’s Pizzeria and the staff choose to celebrate their emphatic victory with a celebration straight from the football field. Owner Marc Malnati couldn't wait to share the good news and is seen in a YouTube clip posted by the restaurant marching into one of the business’s kitchens. Scroll down for video . After Lou Malnati's Pizzeria has been voted Chicago's 'Best Deep Dish pizza', owner Marc Malnati couldn't wait to share the good news .

As Malnati shares news of the victory he is greeted with loud cheers and high-fives, but then his employees ‘surprise’ him by dumping a tub of the restaurant's special cold tomato sauce all over his head. The celebration follows the time-honored sports tradition of drenching someone with a vat of the Gatorade after a big win. Unfortunately for Malnati he receives a shower of thick and sticky pizza sauce, rather than a sports drink-style soaking. The boss seems to take his dunking very well and by the looks of this elaborate video, he was probably in on the joke from the start. 'What happened to Gatorade?' Unfortunately for Malnati he received a shower of thick and sticky pizza sauce rather than the sports drink . One employee couldn't resist getting his hands dirty and massaged the tomato sauce into his bosses' hair . Still he's a good sport about it all and jokingly asks, 'What happened to Gatorade?' before barking ‘get back to work!’ at his staff. Approximately 50,000 people voted in the poll conducted by Eater Chicago. With 51 percent of the vote, Lou Malnati’s beat out other Chicago deep dish staples Pizzeria Uno, Gino’s East, and Giordano’s. Only Gino’s East came close, with nearly 40 percent of the vote. Legend has it that Chicago-style deep-dish pizza was invented at Pizzeria Uno, in Chicago, in 1943, either by Uno's founder Ike Sewell or the restaurant's original pizza chef Rudy Malnati. Malnati takes his dunking very well and by the looks of the elaborate video, he was probably in on the joke from the start . The first Lou Malnati's Pizzeria opened in 1971 and now there are 37 branches throughout Chicago and the surrounding suburbs . As the name suggests, the crust is very deep, creating a very thick pizza that resembles a pie more than a flat-bread New York-style pizza. Lou Malnati began working with his father Rudy in the 1940s making deep-dish pizza and in the 1950s they co-managed Pizzeria Uno. Then in 1971, Lou and his wife Jean opened the first Lou Malnati's Pizzeria in Lincolnwood, Illinois. There are now 37 branches of the pizzeria throughout Chicago and the surrounding suburbs.","Lou Malnati’s Pizzeria has been voted the 'Best Deep Dish' pizza in Chicago .

Brockie, known to fans as intergalactic humanoid barbarian 'Oderus Urungus', was found by his roommate about 7pm yesterday. Detectives don't currently suspect foul play and said the medical examiner's office will determine the cause of the 50-year-old's death. TMZ quoted sources as saying drugs weren't found at the West Seminary Avenue, Richmond, home and that it was not a suicide. Scroll down for video . Tragic: David Brockie, the singer of heavy metal band GWAR, has been found dead in his Virginia home . Singer: GWAR frontman Dave Brockie was known to fans as 'Oderus Urungus' and appeared as an intergalactic humanoid barbarian with devil horns . The Grammy-nominated band, founded by Brockie in 1984, is known for its comically grotesque costumes, stage antics and vulgar lyrics. News of the cult singer's death has shocked friends and fans, with messages of condolence flooding social media. 'Today is sad day, we lost a great guy! Dave Brockie / Oderus, if you have any stories of you and Odreus please feel free to share with us. WE MISS YOU Dave! (sic)' Alternative Revolt Magazine wrote on Facebook. 'Dave, you were always the nicest and funniest guy whenever I got to talk to you around town,' band Fire & Ice shared. 'Thanks for getting me into GWAR shows and giving me cool s***. Sorry I was such a punisher as a young kid.' Investigating: Detectives don't currently suspect foul play and said the medical examiner's office will determine the cause of the 50-year-old's (pictured) death .

The band: GWAR, founded by Brockie in 1984, gained international fame for their outrageous stage show, gory costumes and wild personas . Former GWAR bassist Mike Bishop said Brockie will be remembered for his creativity, humor and energy. 'He was brash sometimes, always crass, irreverent, he was hilarious in every way. But he was also deeply intelligent and interested in life, history, politics and art,' Bishop told Style Weekly. 'His penchant for scatological humors belied a lucid wit. He was a criminally underrated lyricist and hard rock vocalist, one of the best, ever! 'A great front man, a great painter, writer, he was also a hell of a bass guitarist. I loved him. He was capable of great empathy and had a real sense of justice.' Scene: Brockie was found dead in his home on the 4800 block of West Seminary Avenue in Richmond, Virginia (pictured) GWAR, who described themselves as 'Scumdogs of the Universe', released their 13th album last year and recently toured Australia and Japan. Brockie always appeared on stage as an intergalactic humanoid barbarian with devil horns and a meaty-looking face, carrying a long sword called an 'Unt Lick'. The heavy metal band gained international fame for their outrageous stage show and wild personas, with GWAR members creating their own gory costumes. Their video clips were also a staple of TV show 'Beavis and Butt-Head'. 'Anyone who has seen GWAR knows itâ€™s an adult comedy rock musical,' Brockie told CBS 6 reporter Mark Holmberg in 2011. Style Weekly reported Brockie was a devoted fan of the Washington Redskins and a World War II buff, who had recently fulfilled his lifelong dreams of visiting Stalingrad and playing shows in Japan. In 2011, GWAR's lead guitarist 34-year-old Cory Smoot was found dead on the band's tour bus.","David M. Brockie found dead in his Virginia home by his roommate yesterday .

"By . Sam Webb . The writer of the Inspector Morse detective novels admired actor John Thaw's performance as the curmudgeonly detective so much he has written a clause into his will banning other actors from playing the part after he dies. Colin Dexter, 83, created the popular character in 1975 and the novels were adapted into TV series Inspector Morse that ran from 1987 to 2000 with Thaw, who died in 2002, in the lead role. Mr Dexter said: 'We never want to repeat what John has done.' Author Colin Dexter (right) has written a clause into his will so no other actor can play his creation Inspector Morse after he dies because he doesn't want anyone to try and outdo actor John Thaw (left) in the role . 'A lot of people connected with Morse didn't want anyone coming along to say we will try and outdo dear old John. 'I said I'm not ever going to allow that, full stop,' he told The Independent. The clause was revealed in a Radio Times interview with actor Shaun Evans. Evans, 34, plays the younger version of the character in Endeavour, a prequel that gets its title from the detective's unusual first name. The ITV drama, penned as a prequel to the . long-running TV series, made its debut with a . feature-length special in 2012 and has spawned two series. The series was only made possible thanks to the determination of the executive producer, who took four years to convince Mr Dexter to allow it. The clause was revealed in a Radio Times interview with actor Shaun Evans, who plays the younger version of the character in Endeavour . Mr Evans said: 'I know that the creator, Colin Dexter, has it in his will that no one else can play the part, which is as it should be. 'It's not something that can go on and on. I really don't think it will.' Mr Evans has told how he looked to . comedian Michael Palin for inspiration when it came to playing the young . Morse - and also suggested that he could call time on the famous . character. Asked whether viewers can expect to see the drama move into the 1970s, Evans replied: 'Listen, never say never. It would be a great life for me, I suppose. But is it something you'd want, creatively? 'I'm not so sure.' He said that instead of turning to recordings of Thaw and attempting to impersonate the popular actor, he looked for inspiration elsewhere. Shaun Evans (left) who has stepped into John Thaw's shoes to play the younger version of Colin Dexter's Inspector Morse . 'I listened a lot to Michael Palin, who was from the north, went to Oxford and who was alive at that time. That's how I imagine Morse's voice to be,' he said. Lewis is a spin-off from Inspector Morse. Like that series, it was set primarily in Oxford, Oxfordshire. Kevin Whately reprised his character Robert 'Robbie' Lewis, who had been Morse's sergeant and loyal friend in the original series. Lewis had now been promoted to detective inspector and is assisted by DS James Hathaway, portrayed by Laurence Fox. He also read Dexter's novels, where the character is more lecherous than he was in Inspector Morse. 'The more we can introduce of that, the better,' he told the magazine. 'I'm always fighting to make that a reality, without him becoming this full-on seedy, depraved character, of course. 'What you don't want is for it to be sanitised and pasteurised, which a lot of stuff is nowadays.' Evans said that Scandinavian crime dramas such as The Killing and The Bridge had also left their mark on Endeavour. 'Audiences want a certain darkness now and you have to pay attention to that. There's no denying that this character is a bit of a loner and slightly out of joint with his time and place. 'That's what I find endearing about him. And perhaps the audience does, too,' he said. Evans added: 'The world doesn't need another detective series, so we have to do something different with it. 'If you're going to do a show that has already had a long life, you have to grab it and do something new. So that's what we attempted and I feel we've largely succeeded.' Inspector Morse also inspired the spin-off ITV detective series Lewis, starring Kevin Whately, who played Chief Inspector Morse's sidekick in the original sleuth drama. Morse is as a senior CID officer with . the Thames Valley Police force in Oxford. He famously drives a . Jaguar, likes real ale and enjoys opera, poetry and art. He . first appeared in the 1975 book Last Bus To Woodstock and made his TV . debut in Inspector Morse, portrayed by John Thaw, in 1987. There are 13 books in total, and author Colin Dexter has also written short stories about the gruff-yet-likeable police officer. Actor John . Thaw played the part until 2000. At its peak, the the series attracted . more than 18 million viewers in the UK, and the show was sold to some 200 countries. The . character died from a heart attack in, The . Remorseful Day, published in 1999. He died on-screen in 2000. Thaw died . two years later.

"By . Nathan Klein . Gone too soon: A picture of Wang Moheng, who was one of the 239 passengers aboard missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 . After more than two weeks of uncertainty, pain and fear, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak yesterday confirmed what everyone already knew in their hearts: the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 had crashed in the southern Indian Ocean, killing all 239 people on board. And while it is unclear why the Boeing 777-200 crashed, we do know some of those passengers - including 23-month-old Wang Moheng - died tragically with their whole life still ahead of them. As the youngest person on the flight and one of his first trips abroad - Moheng was taken to the tropics of Malaysia by his parents and grandparents simply to escape the 'bad air in Beijing', a friend said. Following their relaxing holiday, the family of five left Kuala Lumpur early Saturday for Beijing but never arrived. People from at least 13 countries were aboard the Boeing jet, with the 153 Chinese passengers by far the most numerous. Of those from China, Moheng was the youngest. His picture went viral on social networking sites yesterday, circulating on Facebook and Twitter thousands of times as people stopped to remember the faces behind the tragedy of MH370. Wang Rui, the young boy’s father, worked in the Beijing office of Boston Consulting Group, an American company. Moheng’s mother, Jiao Weiwei, worked at a Chinese software company. Her parents were also on the plane. Rui's friend Saleel Limaye told CNN he received an email from him a week before the plane went missing. 'He seemed pretty excited about having a break from work,' he said. 'He's a very smart, hard-working person. He was a very diligent student...and was always one of those guys who would go the extra mile for his teammates. He was slightly quiet but very warm, affectionate person.' Moheng wasn't the only one whose life was unfairly cut short. Many of the 239 passengers, like the Wang family, had been on holiday in south-east Asia, a popular destination for Chinese. There was also a Canadian couple living in Beijing, returning from a vacation in Vietnam they had taken without their two young sons, who were being watched by a grandmother at home. The plane was also carrying a few large groups, including more than 20 painters and calligraphers who had been honored at an exhibition in Malaysia, and Chinese employees of an American semiconductor company traveling to China with Malaysian colleagues for a work meeting. And the there were also those in transit, who were intending to just pass through Beijing en route to another destination. One of those transients was Paul Weeks, a 39-year-old New Zealand engineer living in Perth, Australia, with his wife and two sons - one of whom was born just last year. He was heading to Mongolia for an assignment with a mining and construction company when the plane vanished. 'I’m taking it minute by minute,' his wife, Danica Weeks, told reporters in Perth. 'I can’t think beyond the minute. I’ve got two young kids, and I have a 3-year-old asking, ""When is Daddy going to Skype?""’ Attempts to find the plane today were cancelled due to poor weather, with crews expected to venture out again tomorrow to resume the search.","Wang Moheng was the youngest passenger on board missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 .

"By . Mia De Graaf . A drab brick building on the side of the A40, you wouldn't guess this storage company is packed full of priceless war-era artefacts. But observant drivers that look up will spot there's something unusual about Vanguard. Whether it's an anti-aircraft gun or an RAF Spitfire, sometimes even a double-decker bus, one of the incredible items will be tantalisingly placed on the roof for all to see. Artefact: The Hawker Hunter, perched on the roof of Vanguard in West London. It is one of the pieces of 'junk' Mac McCullagh collected in years of heavy-lifting . Unusual: The veteran soldier and storage company owner places items such as an RAF spitfire plane on his roof by the A40 to brighten the days of passing motorists . It is the only glimpse veteran soldier Mac McCullagh offers into his emporium of cast-offs, which is his own personal collection amidst his client's belongings. Outsiders are not permitted to tours. One of the prized possessions is a . Linotype printer. Designed in 1883 by German engineer Ottmar Mergenthaler, it was once the treasured machine used to create the nation's newspapers, magazines, and posters. A 7.3” anti-aircraft gun, weighing 17 tonnes, has made an appearance on the roof, decades after its debut on the battlefield in 1937. The powerful weapon was known to fire a shell to a height of 59,300ft. And sat amongst the machinery is an original London Routemaster bus, abandoned years ago by the government in a crackdown on road safety and pollution levels. Mr McCullagh's now extensive stockpile started as a side project at the heavy-lifting business he founded exactly 50 years ago with two fellow servicemen, Eddie McCormack - an expert in moving machinery - and Ian Sandeberg. Festive: A giant Father Christmas was placed on top of the building in December. Mr McCullagh still has cranes left over from their lifting work to put up his displays . Emporium: The proud businessman's collection of artefacts was built up over years of storage. This London Routemaster was one of the abandoned objects .

Elderly retired Linotype Casting machines in Vanguard¿s warehouse at Western Avenue. The Linotype machine is possibly the most famous machine in the printing industry; it was designed by a brilliant German engineer Ottmar Mergenthaler in 1883 . Enraptured by the machinery, he began to cumulate some of the abandoned 'junk' they had to move. Together, . the trio orchestrated the transport of historic monuments including the . Trafalagar Square Christmas Tree for 30 years, the 486-tonne Daily Mail . printing presses from Paris, and the Victorian Engines of Tower Bridge. Within . a few years the firm diversified into removals, storage, and tropical . plant sellers - and started up setting offices across the country. Despite selling off the crane business . long ago to focus on storage, they still have some bits of equipment to . shift about the artillery guns and fighter jets. The Hawker Hunter that Mr McCullagh lifts . up during the summer months was one of the first ever used by the RAF . in 1953. And the RAF Spitfire was given to the trio specifically for the roof after they helped move an exhibition-load of craft. For the festive season, a giant blow-up Father Christmas overlooked the busy commuters passage. And when it gets too cluttered, he can always lift his own car onto the roof to clear space. 'It's just a lot of fun,' Mr McCullagh said. A London scene: Last year the firm chose a mini London scene to decorate the snow-topped building . Make room: Using some of the cranes left over from the heavy-lifting business, before they moved into predominantly storage, Mr McCullagh sometimes has to move his car onto the roof for space .

'We always tried to say yes to clients so we did end up doing some odd projects. 'Once we had to move a hippo from Madrid zoo to Chessington World of Adventures. 'My highlight was meeting the Queen when we went to move some aircraft off the roof. 'We also specialised in the careful movement and storage of . expensive precision machinery throughout Europe and further afield for . decades, and the Hawker Hunter is one of the pieces. 'Putting these planes, buses, dogs on the roof... It's like a taste of the 50 years gone by.' The fascination began when Mr McCullagh was called up for National Service in 1959, one of the last intakes.

Shortly, the colonel asked him to take command of Reece Troop, eight Ferret armoured cars, and two three-tonne vehicles. Mr McCullagh said: 'The first 6 weeks of square bashing wasn’t the most peaceful but thereafter it was fun. 'Reece Troop in an armoured regiment is an exciting job; they are the eyes and ears of the regiment. 'I would be the first to confess that National Service did me and my lasting friends the power of good!' Returning to London five years later, he was one of the three founders of Vanguard which started on August 4, 1964.

"By . Paul Cahalan . Wind farms have scarred the British landscape and turned the public against the renewable energy agenda, an Energy Minister has conceded. Greg Barker made the admission as he promised that future projects would be located off-shore. ‘We put certain projects in the wrong place,’ the Energy and Climate Change Minister said. ‘Some planners have been too insensitive to the impact on the landscape and it has turned public opinion against the wider renewable agenda. 'Wrong place': Energy minister Greg Barker said some planners have been 'too insensitive' 'We are very clear about the need to limit the impact on the countryside and landscape. It is quite clear the expansion of the on-shore wind rush is over.’ Mr Barker’s comments come amid growing political tension over rising household energy bills and a week after it was revealed that a record number of on-shore wind farms have been approved for construction this year. 'Cannot be at any place at any price': Minister Greg Barker . Between January and August, 188 were granted planning permission – a 49 per cent increase on the  same period in 2012. As energy companies continue to lodge applications to take advantage of generous green subsidies, Mr Barker said Britain was on course to meet a target that 20 per cent of electricity must come from sustainable sources by 2020. But the Minister added that he would write to every council, warning they must ban turbines from areas of outstanding natural beauty. He said: ‘There’s enough wind projects in the system now so we don’t need to see any more on-shore expansion. 'The big area for expansion is off-shore, where there is scope for larger projects. ‘With those projects in the system or under consideration in the planning process at the moment, it means we have enough to get to our 2020 targets. ‘But it cannot be at any place and at any price.’","Minister made admissions as he promised future projects would be off-shore .

"By . Aaron Sharp . A team of feral pig hunters are using technology to win their boar war by sending up remote control airplanes fitted with heat seeking cameras to guide them towards their prey. The wild beasts are a serious problem in America's deep south where they cause around $1.5bn worth of damage to crops and wildlife every year. Exterminators at Louisiana Hog Control are often charged with the task of tracking the pigs and killing them before they roam onto the next farm and wreak more havoc. Hunters at Louisiana Hog Control pose with another successful haul, thanks to their trusty radio plane . The team use aerials to beam pictures back to ground where hunters are waiting for instructions to shoot . But the animals are experts in going unseen, often raiding crop fields in the dead of night. Due . to their illusive nature Cy Brown and his partner James Palmer at the . hunting company have had to take special measures to catch up with their . prey. They use a . radio-controlled airplane equipped with a thermal-imaging camera as a . spotter which can then inform a human hunter on the ground. The . method has proven so successful that Brown estimates his team have . killed roughly 300 wild pigs in the last six months alone. Brown and his team of night hunters are so in demand that farmers will pay them a price per pig killed . Black heat spots on the map show pigs eating a farmer's crops in a field under cover of darkness . The hunters use images like this one to direct their troops towards the unsuspecting prey in the black of night . He . said: 'Obviously it’s not completely new technology, but some of the . sensors and computing power has gotten to such a state to where it’s . very easy to build these things, have them last a long time and for them . to have a little bit of brains' Now in his third hunting season, Brown's idea stemmed from his love of model planes. The hunter say that using planes has given them the upper hand, allowing them to kill 300 in the last six months . The nocturnal pigs are less cautious at night having getten used to being able to raid farmers' fields . The scene may look like a blood sport, but wild boars can destroy acres of crops in the American south . 'The . aircraft is certainly capable of going thousands of feet, but generally . the working altitude is 400 feet'  Brown, 36, told FoxNews.com. 'And it’s hard to say whether it will be business, but I know people who are making their living doing this.' The . system he uses is far from military grade, in fact, but anyone wishing . to recreate his system will have to spend a serious amount. This control centre allows the person steering the plane to communicate with other hunters . With two screens, the controller is able to see where his plane is headed and what the map below is showing . His aircraft is worth about $2,000 whereas the camera attached can cost upwards of $10,000 and beyond. He recoups some of that money by charging a kill rate on the amount of pigs he kills, which is  $25 per pig. 'Whoever’s got the most pigs and the most money, that’s where we’ll be.'","Louisiana Hog Control track pigs with thermal imaging camera on a plane .

"By . Tim Shipman . Arthur Scargill celebrated that he had outlived his old foe Lady Thatcher when he heard of her death, it was revealed last night. The militant former leader of the National Union of Mineworkers was the Tory prime minister’s most bitter enemy during the miners' strike of 1984 but has not commented publicly on her demise. But it emerged last night that Ken Capstick, treasurer of the Socialist Labour Party which Arthur Scargill leads, sent the former union boss a text message on Monday reading: ‘Thatcher Dead’. SMS: Ken Capstick, treasurer of the Socialist Labour Party which Arthur Scargill leads, sent the former union boss a text message reading: 'Thatcher Dead'. Mr Scargill replied simply: 'Scargill Alive!' Mr Scargill replied simply: ‘Scargill Alive!’ Mr Capstick told ITV News: ‘I’d been talking to Arthur some ten minutes earlier so I sent him a text message, a very short one, just said “Thatcher dead”. I received one almost instantly saying “Scargill alive!” and he’s very much alive. ‘We now have a situation where the government and the establishment have a funeral on their hands which they wish they didn’t have. They need this like a hole in the head.’ Lady Thatcher’s victories over Mr Scargill in the miner’s strike and Argentine dictator General Galtieri in the Falklands war were hailed by her supporters as the two key moments of her premiership when they paid tribute in Parliament on Wednesday. Mr Scargill staged the nationwide walkout without holding a strike ballot, an omission which fatally undermined public support for the NUM.

What would have become of our democracy had they succeeded?’ Labour’s Lord Gilbert hailed Lady Thatcher’s good fortune in facing Mr Scargill. ‘Baroness Thatcher was very lucky,' he said. 'To say that is in no way to diminish her achievements and accomplishments. ‘Arthur Scargill, I ask you. Would you not love to have Arthur Scargill as your opponent in any debate, a man who is frightened to go to his own members to get them to vote for a strike that he called?

"By . Tim Shipman . Warning: William Hague branded the unrest in Egypt 'the greatest crisis of the 21st century' William Hague has warned that the turmoil in Egypt could continue for ‘decades’ as it emerged that the former dictator Hosni Mubarak is soon to be freed. The Foreign Secretary branded the situation in Cairo ‘very bleak’ and said the drift towards civil war in the most populous Arab nation is the greatest crisis of the 21st century. Violence flared again yesterday with details of two new atrocities emerging. At least 24 policemen loyal to the military regime were gunned down execution-style by Islamist militants in the Sinai desert. And 36 Islamist prisoners suffocated when teargas was fired into their van as they were being moved out of the capital in a convoy. The Muslim Brotherhood described the incident as ‘murder’ while the authorities said a jailbreak had been thwarted . Further violence is likely when the disgraced dictator is to be released from prison by the military regime, which ousted the Islamist government of Mohammad Morsi elected in 2011. Mubarak, who ruled Egypt from 1981, was convicted and sentenced to life in prison last year for failing to stop the killing of protesters in the revolt that swept him from power two years ago. But it was revealed yesterday that he has been cleared and is set for release – a move that could lead to greater bloodshed. At least 850 people, including 70 policemen and soldiers, have been killed since the army-backed government forcibly dispersed Brotherhood sit-ins in Cairo on Wednesday. Mr Hague told the BBC yesterday: ‘It is a very bleak situation, it’s hard to overstate the levels of hatred and mistrust between the various sides of politics in Egypt so it’s a very, very difficult situation. ‘There may be years of turbulence in Egypt and other countries going through this profound debate about the nature of democracy and the role of religion in their society. ‘What’s happening now in the Middle East is the most important event so far of the 21st century, even compared to the financial crisis we’ve been through in terms of its impact on world affairs and I think it will take years and maybe decades for it to play out.’ Release: Hosni Mubarak, pictured in court earlier this year, is set to be freed from prison this week . Chaos: The violence in Egypt continued today as 24 policemen were killed in Sinai . Clashes: Hundreds have been killed since Egypt's president Mohammed Morsi was deposed . The Foreign Secretary said he would discuss with his EU counterparts whether to withdraw aid from Egypt. to apply pressure on Cairo’s army-backed government to end violence and find a political compromise. Egypt’s ambassador to Britain claimed last night that the military-led offensive on the Muslim Brotherhood was intended to be no different from the British response to the 2011 London riots, but turned bloody when the Muslim Brotherhood started firing on the security forces. But he claimed that the Islamists had to be destroyed, claiming they used their time in charge to try to take over every aspect of Egyptian society, just as Adolf Hitler’s Nazis did in Germany. Ashraf ElKholy said: ‘Morsi was elected president and held office for one year but in that time he tried to make everything Muslim Brotherhood controlled. ‘Egyptian culture over 5,000 years is a mix of religions and civilisations in which the Islamic religion is one ingredient of the Egyptian character,’ he said. ‘The Muslim Brotherhood are like a Nazi group that demand that everything changes and people everything to their way.’ Fury: Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood supporters walk towards Ramses square in Cairo as they take part in a 'march of anger'. Violent clashes have already left 17 people dead . Hurt: Protesters who support the ousted Egyptian President transport injured people following the  clashes in Ramses Square . Desperate: Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood supporters carry a wounded protestor in Cairo's Ramses square . Fury: Muslim Brotherhood supporters in Sanaa shout slogans during the rally in protest at the recent violence in Egypt . Mubarak’s eventual release could stir more political tension. The 85 year old former autocrat was arrested after a popular uprising overthrew him in February 2011 as unrest spread across the Arab world. The former strongman and military commander appeared in a court-room cage during his trial on charges that ranged from corruption to complicity in the murder of protesters. More than a year on, the only legal grounds for Mubarak’s continued detention rest on another corruption case which his lawyer, Fareed el-Deeb, said would be settled swiftly. ‘All we have left is a simple administrative procedure that should take no more than 48 hours. He should be freed by the end of the week,’ Mr Deeb said. Egyptian judicial sources said the former leader would spend another two weeks behind bars before judicial authorities made a final decision in the outstanding case against him. Mubarak’s release will be seen as significant moment since it will reverse the results of the Arab Spring, which swept his three decades of autocracy away.","Foreign Secretary Hague says the situation in Egypt is 'very bleak'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Good will: Coffee drinkers have latched onto a philanthropic new concept which allows them to order a second drink for the homeless and needy . It doesn't sound as enticing as a cappuccino, flat white or latte, but a new beverage called the 'suspended coffee' is set to take cafes across the country by storm. In a concept born in Naples, Italy, caffeine drinkers not only place their own regular order, they also request a second drink for someone who cannot afford to pay for their own. The idea, which is not just aimed at helping the homeless but those who simply find themselves out of work and broke, for example, spread to Bulgaria and, thanks to the power of social networking sites, is beginning to take off in Britain and around the world. So far, about 150 British cafes have signed up to what has become a formal scheme, while big chains like Starbucks and Costa are making positive noises about getting involved. The concept is based on good faith by both shops and the customers - anyone can enter and asked for a 'suspended coffee' and are unlikely to be asked for their credentials, but it is hoped the most needy people will take advantage. John Sweeney, a 28-year-old plumber from Cork, set up the Suspended Coffees Facebook page, and said he is being inundated with messages. 'I didn't go to bed until 4am and was up at 8.15am,' he said in the Independent on Sunday. 'It's not just an idea for the homeless. I've been in situations where I've been out of work, freezing, and would have loved nothing more than a cup of coffee, but couldn't afford one.' The Facebook page has designed 'Suspended Coffee Supporter' logos which shops can display on their doors. The initiative has a website in development and is working on creating an app for smartphones, while other shops are expanding the idea to cover cookies and other food. Needy: The 'suspended coffee' scheme, which first started in Naples, Italy, can benefit the homeless or even just those struggling for money . Stores in Exeter, Glasgow, Hull and London have all joined the movement, according to the Facebook page, which has about 23,000 'likes'. Hettie Clarke, manager at Coffee7, in Forest Gate, east London, praised the idea, saying: 'We're not going to make judgements. If you can say, 'here is a suspended coffee, from us to you,' you feel like you're doing good, but it's not too in your face.' A Starbucks spokesman said 'suspended coffee is a really interesting campaign and we're looking into it', while other big chains made positive noises on their websites.","'Suspended coffee' scheme taking off as big firms look to get involved .

Petite blonde Michelle Mills, 31, used so much force when she attacked management trainee Edward Miller, 20, that the knife penetrated nine inches into his body and the blade broke away from the handle. Mills then waited 20 minutes before raising the alarm as her besotted partner lay dying on the living room floor of their cottage in the upmarket Leicestershire village of Scalford. Locked up: Former children's nursery worker Michelle Mills, right, has been jailed for life today after stabbing her smitten young lover  Edward Miller, left, 24 times . At Lincoln Crown Court today, judge Michael Heath passed a life sentence on Mills and  described her as a 'manipulative woman' who had shown no signs of remorse. Flanked by a security officer Mills showed no reaction as Judge Heath told her she would serve a minimum of 15 years in jail before being considered for parole. Judge Heath said: 'This was a brutal, ferocious and sustained attack. You loved each other but you were jealous of each other. 'You were extremely angry with him and you were in a rage. He did not realistically stand a chance of defending himself such was the ferocity of the attack. 'I detect no remorse in you. You have only been concerned with yourself. You did your very best to hoodwink the jury but they saw through you.

Eddie, a management trainee at the upmarket Scalford Hall hotel, died after the couple argued following a visit to a Bonfire Night party at the village pub. The jury heard Mills was his first serious girlfriend whereas she admitted to having over 70 previous sexual partners. Miss Yvonne Coen QC, prosecuting, said 'Michelle Mills was considerably older than her boyfriend and obviously had a good deal more life experience. 'He would have been 18 years old when he met Ms Mills. She was Eddie Miller's first serious girlfriend. It seemed to outside observers they appeared to be completely smitten with each other.

"By . Daniel Martin . 'Ugliest side of Ukip': Gerard Batten, a London MEP and Ukip spokesman on immigration was criticised for comments which 'overlap with the far-Right' A senior Ukip politician plunged his party into fresh controversy last night after calling on Muslims to sign a special code of conduct to prove they reject violence. Gerard Batten, a London MEP and the party’s spokesman on immigration, said it was a big mistake for Europe to allow ‘an explosion of mosques across their land’. The comments will heap further pressure on leader Nigel Farage, who has vowed to rid his party of what he called ‘Walter Mitty’ types. Last month he was forced to suspend a town councillor who suggested that the country was suffering floods because of David Cameron’s gay marriage policy. Mr Farage also had to get rid of another MEP, Godfrey Bloom, after he called some women ‘sluts’ and warned against sending aid to ‘Bongo Bongo land’. Last night critics attacked the latest comments from Mr Batten, a member of the party’s executive, saying they represented the ‘ugliest side of Ukip’ and 'overlap with the far-Right'. The MEP told The Guardian that he stood by his call for a ‘charter of Muslim understanding’, which he first suggested in 2006. The document asks Muslims to sign a declaration rejecting violence and says that certain parts of the Koran that promote ‘violent physical Jihad’ should be regarded as ‘inapplicable, invalid and non-Islamic’. Asked on Tuesday about the charter, Mr Batten said he had written it with a friend, who is an Islamic scholar, and could not see why ‘any reasonable, normal person’ would object to signing it. He also repeated his view that some Muslim texts need updating, claiming some say ‘kill Jews wherever you find them and various things like that’. ‘If that represents the thinking of modern people, there’s something wrong, in which case maybe they need to revise their thinking,’ he said. ‘If they say they cannot revise their thinking on those issues, then who’s got the problem - us or them?’ Asked why Muslims have been singled out, rather than followers of other faiths like Christians or Jews, Mr Batten said: ‘Christians aren’t blowing people up at the moment, are they? Are there any bombs going off round the world which are claimed by Christian organisations? I don’t think so.’ In an interview four years ago, Mr Batten also proposed a ban on new mosques across Europe, suggested Muslim countries should not be ‘appeased’ and warned of the threats of having ‘two incompatible systems living in the same place at the same time’. Mr Batten is top of the party’s MEP candidate list for London, having passed a round of psychometric testing to make sure his views were acceptable. He is also a former candidate for London mayor. Muslims celebrate Eid ul-Fitr in London: Mr . Batten is asking Muslims to sign a declaration rejecting violence and . saying that parts of the Koran that promote 'violent physical Jihad' should be regarded as 'inapplicable' Asked yesterday whether he still believed Muslims should sign the charter, Batten said: ‘I don’t suppose the Pope would disagree with it or the Archbishop of Canterbury or anybody else. ‘So why should they feel aggrieved that they might be asked to sign. They don’t have to. If they don’t believe in those five points, they don’t have to sign it.’ In the 2010 interview, Mr Batten suggests a ban on new mosques in ‘our cities’ and warns it was wrong to have allowed so many already. ‘They don’t allow Christian churches or Hindu temples to be built or any kind of non-Muslim place of worship in many of their countries and certainly not in the heartland of their religion,’ he said. ‘Well, if they don’t allow it, why can they expect to see their religion tolerated somewhere else?’ Last night Rehman Chishti, Tory MP for Gillingham and Rainham, said Mr Batten’s position was ‘shocking’. ‘If Nigel Farage had any credibility, he would quite clearly not allow this individual to stand for office in Ukip,’ he said. Sadiq Khan, Labour’s shadow London minister, also said he was ‘appalled at the ignorance that Gerard Batten appears to have shown when speaking about the faith that I and hundreds of thousands of British Muslims practice’. Mary Honeyball, a Labour MEP for London, said Batten ‘represents the ugliest side of Ukip’. ‘Batten’s views overlap with the far-right,’ she said. ‘The idea that Muslims should be singled out in the way he suggests is a relic from a darker, more prejudiced time.’","Gerard Batten slammed for comments that 'overlap with the far-Right'

"By . Mark Duell . A mother whose baby died by hanging herself with a blind cord has vowed to carry on campaigning - after her charity was targeted by online trolls. An inquest four months ago found Amanda O’Halloran's 17-month-old daughter Sophia died after accidentally getting her neck caught in the beaded loop and strangling herself in Gloucestershire. But now, the 22-year-old is facing a stream of online comments blaming her for the death and calling her an 'unfit mother', after she started campaigning for a UK-wide ban on window blind cords. Tragic death: Amanda O'Halloran (left, with partner Chris Parslow) was left devastated when her 17-month-old daughter Sophia (centre) died after she got her neck caught in a beaded loop and strangled herself . Miss O’Halloran went public with her story to raise awareness of the dangers looped blind cords pose to children, but speaking out led to a stream of online comments blaming her for the death. Writing on her Sophia’s Cause campaign page - which she started to fight for a UK-wide ban on the cords - the Cheltenham resident admitted the ill-informed remarks had left her feeling depressed. Miss O’Halloran said: ‘I’ve been criticised a lot about Sophia’s Cause, people telling me that banning blinds with cords is pointless and that it is my fault Sophia died. ‘I’ve been blamed and called an unfit parent, neglectful and that people like me should not “breed”.’ Accidental: Miss O'Halloran had only left Sophia alone for a few minutes while going to the toilet - but the toddler put her head in the noose of the cord, slipped over and cut off her air supply . But she added that she has tried to stay positive, saying: ‘At first it broke me. I slipped into a deep depression and just wanted to be out of this world with my little girl. 'I’ve been blamed and called an unfit parent, neglectful and that people like me should not ""breed""' Amanda O’Halloran . ‘At some point I decided to ignore the trolls. I realised that these people were in their few and 95 per cent of people have in fact been very kind and supportive. ‘I decided I wanted to make a difference and needed to do something, not just for my own sanity but for my little girl and for every child out there. So I started Sophia’s Cause. ‘I will persevere, I won’t stop. I will carry on creating awareness and Sophia’s Cause will live on in the memory of my beautiful Sophia. I love you baby girl.’ Only 17 months old: Sophia died on the morning of June 27 last year - and it would have taken as little as seven seconds for her to lose consciousness . In another post, Miss O’Halloran said: ‘Behind all of the campaigning is a grieving mummy, daddy and family. It’s so sad others have to spoil it and make it harder, it still hurts and it always will. Tribute: Sophia's Cause was started in her honour . ‘I’m just thankful we have so many more supporters than trolls - people who actually care and take the time to write lovely comments and share the campaign.’ Sophia died on the morning of June 27 last year - and it would have taken as little as seven seconds for her to lose consciousness. Miss O’Halloran had only left Sophia alone for a few minutes while going to the toilet - but the toddler put her head in the noose of the cord, slipped over and tragically died. The blind cord had been in the house since she and partner Chris Parslow, a builder, moved in 18 months earlier - hidden behind the curtain where it had gone unnoticed. Sophia - whose parents are expecting another baby girl in just over a month - is the 28th person known to have died in this way in Britain since 1999. The Sophia’s Cause campaign includes a Facebook page and an online petition which could force a ban on window blind cords to be debated in Parliament if it gathers 100,000 names. The appeal has only attracted more than 5,000 signatures in support so far, and the parents have become involved in the first ever Family Safety Week. Safety devices are sold with most blinds which include cleats to tie the cord to the wall, keeping it taut, and chain-break connectors which will pull apart when undue pressure is applied. But they rely on the person fitting the blinds to make sure they are applied correctly.","Amanda O’Halloran's 17-month-old daughter Sophia died at home last year .

"By . Tim Shipman . Labour was in turmoil last night as members of the Shadow Cabinet, party donors and businessmen united to condemn Ed Balls’s plans to raise the top rate of tax to 50p. Insiders said the Shadow Chancellor has left Ed Miliband’s top team divided over the wisdom of ramping up tax after refusing to consult his senior colleagues about Labour’s biggest economic announcement in a year. Former Labour City minister Lord Myners accused Mr Balls of using ‘GCSE economics’ to justify a return to the ‘politics of envy’, while other critics said the move would deter investors from coming to Britain and damage economic growth. Division: Former Labour ministers accused Ed Balls of employing 'GCSE economics' to device his latest tax policy . With his credibility under fire, Mr Balls then used an interview yesterday to deny that the deficit left by Labour was a problem. He even boasted that if he had his time in power again he would have spent even more money in some areas. And he refused to say what blend of spending cuts and tax rises he would adopt to balance the books – raising the spectre of further tax raids on middle England. In a speech to the Left-wing Fabian Society on Saturday, Mr Balls revealed that Labour will increase the income tax rate from 45p in the pound to 50p for those earning over £150,000 until 2020 if the party wins power next year. He also said Labour would eliminate the deficit by 2020 – two years slower than George Osborne has planned. A senior Labour figure told the Mail that Mr Balls sprung the plans on the Shadow Cabinet last week and also revealed that several shadow ministers think the decision is a mistake. ‘It wasn’t discussed with us,’ a member of the Shadow Cabinet said. ‘We were told in advance but we didn’t get to have a say. Frankly we’re pretty divided over whether it is a good idea. There is no unity on that.’ Controversial: Ed Balls made the tax pledge in a speech on Saturday to the Fabian Society . In his speech, Mr Balls claimed that the plan could bring in £15billion over five years. But Government figures, backed up by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility and the respected Institute for Fiscal Studies, show that cutting the top rate is only set to cost the Government £100million. In an interview with the BBC’s Andrew Marr yesterday, Mr Balls admitted that he has no idea how much money the tax rise will bring in. ‘The question is how much,’ he said. The plans were roundly denounced by two of Gordon Brown’s ministers. Lord Myners said: ‘The economic logic behind his thinking would not get him a pass at GCSE economics. Ed Balls takes us back to old Labour and the politics of envy. We need to encourage productive enterprise and effort rather than resort to predatory taxation.’ Lord (Digby) Jones, a former trade minister who now sits as a crossbench peer, accused Labour of devising an ‘if it creates wealth let’s kick it’ policy. He predicted Mr Balls would ramp the top rate even higher, to 55p or 60p, if he gets his hands on power – a claim Mr Balls denies. Those questioning the move yesterday included Xavier Rolet, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, who warned that the swingeing tax rate could deter foreign investors from coming to the UK. Labour left Britain with a deficit 5.3 per cent of GDP at the start of the financial crisis – the highest in the G7 group of the world’s biggest economies. But Mr Balls told the Andrew Marr Show: ‘Do I think the level of public spending going into the crisis was a problem for Britain? No, I don’t.’ Sajid Javid, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, said: ‘Labour got us into a mess by spending and borrowing too much in the good years. ‘But Ed Balls thinks the deficit was not “too high” at the time, and says he would do it all over again. It’s the same old Labour.’ Should we need confirmation that Labour was returning to type as the party of high taxes and state intervention in business we now have it. The pledge by Ed Balls to lift the tax paid by the very highest earners to 50 pence in the pound looks like a return to the bad old Labour of the 1970s when Chancellor Denis Healey vowed to tax the rich until ‘the pips squeak’. Until Saturday, when the burly Shadow Chancellor unveiled his new script, the City and the business community had drawn a distinction between ‘Bad Ed’ and ‘Good Ed’. Bad Ed was Miliband, with his hugely damaging threats of intervention in the markets – starting off with his promise to freeze energy prices – undermining not only the energy sector but banking, house-building and out-sourcing companies as well as the safety of the FTSE 100 as a place to invest. Believe it or not, Good Ed was Balls, who from his days in the Blair-Brown government had bought into the Anglo-Saxon economic model of free markets, low taxation and soft-touch regulation of the financial community. Clearly, though, Labour now feels so desperate to develop a winning narrative in the face of the stupendous gains in employment over recent months and the International Monetary Fund’s endorsement of the British recovery that it has decided to play the class card. By seeking to revive the 50 per cent tax band for people earning over £150,000 a year, it is endeavouring to portray the Tories as the party of the rich. In so doing it has abandoned New Labour and Lord Mandelson’s famous dictum that he was ‘intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich’. Only in the dying days of the 1997-2010 Labour government did the party increase taxes on higher earners in a revenge attack on the perceived role of the bankers in bringing the financial system crashing down. Until then Labour had been more than happy to keep a top rate of 40 per cent – less than the 45 per cent introduced by George Osborne – for almost its whole period in office. The biggest criticism of the high taxation of big earners is that it stifles entrepreneurship and drives the most talented individuals overseas. Top executives at some of our most successful exporters, such as drinks giant Diageo, have told me that many of their best managers sought overseas postings because Alistair Darling introduced the 50 per cent rate as Chancellor under Gordon Brown. Britons do not have to look far to see the sheer economic vandalism caused by high taxes. Long before President Hollande of France’s love life became the story, he was in deep trouble because of his decision to introduce tax rates for the most wealthy of up to 80 per cent. Entrepreneurship ground to a halt, the economy stuttered and there was an exodus of executives to London. It is an inexorable law of economics that the lower the tax rate, the more the income that is generated for a country. High taxes act as a disincentive to hard work and business creativity. Figures from Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) show that the Exchequer will raise £49.3billion from the 45 per cent tax rate this year, against £41.6billion in 2012-2013 when the 50 per cent rate was in place. This is partly because the higher the tax level, the more those earning the highest incomes look for ways to avoid paying tax. The dangerous aspect of the schoolboy economics of the two Eds is that it damages the very people they claim to represent. By aiming an arrow at the heart of enterprise they damage economic confidence and the willingness of business people – from the smallest corner shop to the big corporations – to invest and to create jobs. Labour appears set on a path of wanton economic and financial destruction that undermines growth and the value of all our savings in pensions and ISAs. The very idea that any of this can end the pressure on living standards – a consequence of the mess Labour left behind – is sheer, unadulterated fantasy.","Shadow Chancellor's plans to raise tax caused rifts in Labour, say insiders .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Controversial David Silvester - a member of Henley Town Council - spoke out at an extraordinary meeting last on Tuesday evening called to consider whether he should resign . A UKIP councillor who said the floods plaguing Britain were caused by the homosexual marriage law,  has been expelled from the party after saying gays should repent. Controversial David Silvester - a member of Henley Town Council - spoke out at an extraordinary meeting last on Tuesday evening called to consider whether he should resign. He made national headlines two weeks ago when he wrote a letter to his local newspaper saying that the deluge of floods was caused because of David Cameron’s successful move to change the law about same-sex marriage. At a meeting of the town council on Tuesday evening, members voted unanimously to distance themselves from their councillor colleague’s views. Bizarrely, Mr Silvester also voted for the motion. However, he took the floor at the meeting to refuse to resign and outspokenly called for gay people to seek repentance from God, adding that he stood by his earlier comments in the Henley Standard. Mr Silvester was suspended and subsequently expelled from UKIP over his letter to the newspaper in which he warned David Cameron that 'natural disasters' would follow the passing of the same sex marriage Bill. Speaking to a packed town hall chamber, Cllr Silvester said: 'Never was it my intention to insult the gay community and I certainly apologise to them if personal insult has been their perception.' He added that his aim had in fact been to criticise the Government for passing the Bill and ignoring 'the national textbook, the Holy Bible.' 'I have read that I am barmy to connect this to the weather - if that is the case then I am in good company,' he said, citing senior bishops blaming floods on 'abandonment' of bible teachings. 'The Jesus I serve welcomes all possible types of person, whether straight or gay,' he said. 'All they have to do is come to him in repentance and faith.' In 2007, The Right Reverend Graham Dow, Bishop of Carlisle, argued that the floods that year were a judgment on society’s moral decadence and the fact that 'every type of lifestyle is now regarded as legitimate.' Cllr Silvester said he was exercising his right to free speech by writing to the newspaper, which he claims held back his letter for three weeks and added his political and town council affiliations. 'I have had endless support from all over the country and the world and have the confidence to stand by every word I wrote,' he said. Mr Silvester wrote another letter to the Henley Standard in April 2012 in which he told David Cameron not to legalise gay marriage and warned of 'disasters' if he did . However, he conceded he will be 'more circumspect' in his views in future and said he intended to serve on the council for his full four-year term. Several councillors spoke to distance themselves from his views but added that he had served Henley-on-Thames well, in voluntary roles at Oxfam shops, community groups and on the council. Councillor Laila Meachin said: 'I would not support David’s resignation as I know he is a good councillor for Henley on Thames. However, I feel there is a huge danger in ostracising anyone, whether it is intended that way or not.' Councillor Samantha Evans, in distancing herself from his comments, added: 'I am a Christian too and I have a sister who is homosexual and I lived through what she went through with homophobic comments, remarks and all sorts. Pestilence: Part of the letter in the Henley Standard, claiming recent floods were godly vengeance . 'Mostly fear and sometimes hatred comes from things that are not understood and not known about. 'To say that a section of our community - and whether they choose to get married or not is to blame for this - comes very close in my opinion to crossing the line between expressing an opinion and inciting hatred.' In a 20-minute session for the public to speak, several residents also spoke of the need to protect free speech while others called for Mr Silvester’s resignation. His wife, Eileen, said they had owned a caravan which up until last year was on a site run by a lesbian couple they 'loved and respected.' 'This is nothing to do with individuals, it is all to do with the fact that the word of God says marriage is for a man and a woman,' she said. Sarah Butcher, who started a petition calling for his resignation which has reached 25,000 signatures, said: 'There is a huge gay community in Henley-on-Thames, which he represents to one degree or another, which has been incredibly upset and hurt by his comments. 'His comments only serve to make life more difficult for young people struggling with their sexuality.' Edwin Denning said: 'Everybody has a right to their opinion in this country and it is very dangerous to start saying that is not the case and have people reprimanded for that.' Lucy Thaxton added: 'If somebody put forward views that were as harmful to an ethnic community as those put forward about the gay community by Mr Silvester, we wouldn’t be having this discussion here today.' However, John Street said: 'In the case of David Cameron’s decision to redefine marriage, I think that it is a shameful and wrong thing to do and takes no account of the constitution of this country. I support the councillor in his views.' Mr Silvester declined to comment after the meeting.","David Silvester, 73, wrote a letter to the Henley Standard in Oxfordshire .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Ben Cowburn made a least 43 attempts to take his own life after he was persuaded to do 'sexual things' with a gay TV star, an inquest heard . A teenage boy made at least 43 attempts to take his own life after being persuaded to do 'sexual things' with a gay TV celebrity, an inquest heard today. Ben Cowburn, 18, from Truro, Cornwall, was swept into a hedonistic lifestyle by the man - named only as 'Mr X' - after being appointed his stylist, a coroner was told. But he felt pressured into sexual acts with the star which left him feeling 'disgusted', the inquest heard. The teen, who met the star in a London pub, was allegedly persuaded to strip naked in front of a group of men, who then began to fondle him. On a different occasion, the TV star allegedly crept into his bed for sex. Mr X and Ben fell out, the inquest heard, and the teen made several apparent suicide attempts. He was then admitted to a mental health hospital. There, Ben took a serious drug overdose and, four days later on December 15 2010, he was found dead. The star has never been arrested or questioned over Ben's allegations. The inquest heard how Ben was found wandering in the middle lane of a road near to his home in Cornwall a month before his death. Giving evidence today, Detective Constable Joanna Sodergren told Cornwall Coroner Dr Emma Carlyon Ben had told officers at the scene it was his 43rd attempt to take his own life. Detective Constable Sodergren told the inquest: 'He spoke about being hurt by a couple of men in London which had lasted five months until he left. 'He said he let it happen to punish himself. He was disgusted and he wanted to push it out of his mind. 'Ben said this was the 43rd attempt to end his life. He said he wasn't able to end his life because ""he wouldn't let him"". 'When asked who, Ben said he didn't want to talk about it and it wasn't fair as he was on TV and in magazines on every page, why did he have that after what he did to him. Fashion student Ben, circled on right of frame, was found wandering down a road in an apparent suicide attempt by police - who he told about the alleged abuse . 'He said the man had brought him nice things and took him to nice places but had done sexual things to him. 'Asked if he had been raped or sexually assaulted he said he had not but agreed to them as he felt pressured to do the things. 'He said if he killed himself it would make it better as it would make it go away.' DC Sodergren said when Ben was being driven in the back of a police car after being found on the road on November 18 2010, officers overheard him rapping and mentioning the celebrity's name. She said: 'They heard him rapping and said he mentioned the celebrity and sounded angry. While doing so they recall him using the phrase of being infiltrated by him.' Ben's parents Steve and Sharon Cowburn arrive at the inquest in Truro, Cornwall. Ben made several suicide attempts after falling out with the star and was admitted to a mental health hospital, an inquest heard . Following the incident, Ben was found dead in the bathroom of . the Longreach unit, at the Royal Cornwall Hospital in the early hours of . December 20. Police . seized several items from Ben's room after his death, including four . journals which contained notes about his fashion course, how he was . feeling about himself and poems. In one entry on October 22 Ben wrote that he had made 15 attempts to end his life in 48 hours. Ben's sister Amber. 'Mr X' has never been charged or questioned in relation to the allegations . After he was discovered local police . officers alerted Scotland Yard to 'suggestions that Benjamin may have . been the victim of a serious sexual assault'. The coroner  asked . DC Sodergren if she was satisfied with the way the Metropolitan Police . dealt with the investigation into the death of the tragic teen. She asked: 'Are you satisfied Ben was not subjected to criminal, forced or persuaded sexual activity?' DC Sodergren replied: 'I cannot comment on the Met's investigation. We contacted them because of Ben's disclosure. 'The Metropolitan Police completed an investigation and notified us that their investigation was complete.' The court heard Ben had a history of drug abuse including, cannabis, amphetamine, MDMA and speed. Det Con Sodergren said: 'He said he had a history of drug abuse. 'He . regularly used cocaine while in London and was still very upset about . what has happened in London but did not want to talk about it although . that had happened in London, being sexually assaulted, was the straw . that broke the camels back, there were years of problems with his . family.'

"By . Sadie Whitelocks . A 'super plus-size' model has told how going from thin to fat helped her achieve career success. Velvet D'Amour, a New York native now based in Paris, tried to make it as a model when she was 21 years old but was deemed 'too fat' by agents at a petite 117lbs. Ironically, the five-foot-eight-inch blonde went on to get her big break in French Vogue and on the catwalk for John Galliano and Jean Paul Gaultier, aged 38, weighing 300lbs and a size 26. Scroll down for video . Pushing size acceptance: Velvet D'Amour was deemed too big by model agents when she was 21 years old and weighing 117lbs (pictured left) but shot to fame at the Jean Paul Gaultier catwalk show as a size 26 (right) For the past eight years she has been . striving to 'push size acceptance along' and today unveiled the fourth . issue of her diversity-focused women's magazine, Vol Up 2. D'Amour, 46, launched the quarterly publication in February last year in a bid to encourage women to embrace their 'imperfections' and be proud of their bodies. It features plus-size as well as mainstream models. Through working in fashion - as a model, photographer and now magazine editor - D’Amour . has many thoughts on the status of modeling and the changes she would like to see happen. She told Bustle.com: 'The women we hold as icons of beauty are not happy. And if they’re not happy, who is happy. 'All . the images that are out in the media [are] the same - the 16-year old . white girl who is totally emaciated. Spreading the word: For the past eight years the bubbly blonde has been striving to 'push size acceptance along' and today unveiled the forth issue of her diversity-focused womens magazine, Vol Up 2 . 'Older women are excluded . . . Different ethnicities are never shown.' D’Amour, the youngest of five children from Rochester, New York, said she always dreamed of being a fashion illustrator or designer and would look at 1940s photos of her parents for inspiration. 'I became obsessed with the more eccentric styles,' she says. But because the illustration field was dying out, D’Amour turned her hand to artwork, photography, and performance arts. 'At the time everyone was coked up and maybe 99lbs. So I went down to 117 and model agents said I was still too fat' She moved to Manhattan to study at the School of Visual Arts. With a great bone structure, slender figure and long curly hair, people would often mistake her for a model. 'They’d say you have the face of talent,' she says. IMG models showed interest in her - the same agency representing Gisele Bundchen, Heidi Klum, and Alek Wek - but D'Amour says she couldn't lose enough weight to be on their books. At the time she tipped the scales at a light 140lbs. 'At . the time everyone was completely coked up and maybe 99lbs,' she . added. 'So I went down to 117 and they said I was still too fat.' Feeling rejected, she went on to focus on photography, spending a year studying in Italy under American photographer James White before returning to New York. Keeping toned: While she refuses to obsess over dieting, D'Amour enjoys to swim regularly . D'Amour says when her weight shot up she felt ashamed about her body. But the more she worked with 'perfect-looking unhappy' models the more she came to terms with her larger frame. 'I . started out photographing models and that's actually where my size . acceptance came into play. 'Because I was shooting models and I was not . feeling good about my body and I was shooting women who were the ideal . of beauty. And I was thinking, ""They're not happy with themselves"". And . that was a huge revelation. 'It was highly ironic that I was getting signed at 300 lbs! I considered it a personal victory for all the struggles that I went through to accept my body' 'That . here I was with these ideals of feminine beauty and they hated their . bodies. Now if these women who are the ideals of feminine beauty of our . society hate their bodies, then what exactly is going on?' When the first French plus-size modleing agency opened in Paris, Agence Plus, D’Amour, who was then based in the city, approached them about being a photographer. 'I showed them my [work] so they’d get a feel for my talent,' she recalled. 'But I also included photos of myself so they could see I was a plus-size woman, and they said, ""Well, we want to sign YOU."" She previously told Raannt.com during an interview: 'It was highly ironic that I was getting signed at age 38 and near 300 lbs! 'I considered it a personal victory for all the struggles that I went through to accept my body and the rollercoaster ride which yoyo dieting led it on.' Embracing her curves: D'Amour says when her weight shot up she felt ashamed about her body. But the more she worked with 'perfect-looking unhappy' models the more she came to terms with her larger frame . She made headlines after appearing as a plus-size model in Jean-Paul Gaultier's Paris Fashion Week show in October 2006. She also made a catwalk appearance in John Galliano's runway presentation entitled 'Everybody is Beautiful' the same season, scoring her a spot in French Vogue shot by photographer Nick Knight. A keen performer, the same year she landed the lead role in Avida, a French dark comedy, and later participated in the third season of France's popular reality TV show, Celebrity Farm. Critics have accused D'Amour of 'promoting obesity' but she insists she is healthy and has no high blood pressure or cholesterol problems. Unlike many of her contemporaries, she says she does not abuse drugs, alcohol or cigarettes.

She . concludes on her blog: 'For those who spend their nights up wringing . their hands together, sick with worry over my health, there are so many . examples of unhealthy models and celebrities. 'Sadly some aren’t just unhealthy, but actually dead, and yet none are banned from the media. 'So many women suffer from poor body image, wake each day to loathe their image in the mirror, do you sincerely believe that by pretending fat people don’t exist somehow changes this phenomenon for the better?! 'We do exist, we always have and we always will, there will always be a fatty somewhere in this vast world. 'If there is any shred of sincerity in your feigned concern over a fat person’s health, then instead of mocking us when we do get to the gym, or track, or waddle our way into a pool, take a second to encourage someone to better health. 'At the end of the day, the true beauty we will all be left with isn’t cloaked in Dior or Lanvin, it’s the simple acts of kindness which have made a difference in the lives of others, which no cellulite or wrinkle can ever erase.'","Velvet D'Amour, a New York native now based in Paris, was deemed 'too fat' by model agents when she was aged 21 and weighed 117lbs .
Ironically, the five-foot-eight-inch blonde went on to get her big break aged 38, weighing 300lbs and a size 26 .
Today she published the fourth issue of her diversity-focused magazine, Vol Up 2, in a bid to get women embracing their 'imperfections'"
"By . James Rush . Royal Mail is planning to axe 1,600 jobs as part of a cost-cutting drive, the company said today, just six months after it controversially floated on the Stock Exchange. The postal delivery service said it was due to begin consultations with the Communication Workers Union and Unite over the move which will largely involve managerial positions. The company said the move would not affect postmen and women or the services provided to customers. Royal Mail has today said it is consulting on plans to cut 1,600 jobs (file picture) It also said 300 new or enhanced positions would be created, leaving a net reduction of 1,300 roles. The proposed job losses are part of a cost-cutting programme which Royal Mail hopes will deliver annual savings of around £50 million a year, including £25 million in 2014/15. The programme will result in an additional £100 million costs for the current financial year, taking the total to £230 million. Royal Mail said it was committed to handling the consultation 'carefully and sensitively'. Its European parcel delivery company, GLS, is not affected. It said that, since 2003, 50,000 employees had left the group and it had a strong record of 'achieving change through natural turnover, redeployment and voluntary redundancy wherever possible'. Chief executive Moya Greene said: 'We are continuously improving our efficiency, whilst maintaining our high quality of service. Royal Mail said the move would not affect postmen and women or the services provided to customers (file picture) 'We need to do so in order to effectively compete in the letters and parcels markets. This is the best way to ensure the continued delivery of the universal service and the good-quality jobs we provide for our people.' The Unite union's Royal Mail officer Brian Scott raised the prospect of strike action in the event of compulsory redundancies . He said: 'First the Government sells off Royal Mail on the cheap and now the newly privatised service is ruthlessly sacrificing jobs. 'We do not believe that it's a coincidence that this announcement has been made just before the company prepares to announce its first full set of accounts since privatisation. 'It's more proof that Royal Mail's primary reason for existing is now about making profits rather than serving the nation. 'For all that Royal Mail managers have been through they do not deserve to be treated in this way. 'Unite is demanding a commitment to no compulsory redundancies on fair terms and an effective method for redeployment within the restructured organisation. If Royal Mail refuse, we will have no alternative than to consider a ballot for industrial action.' The announcement comes just three months after Royal Mail struck an agreement with union leaders on pay, pensions and other issues linked to the privatisation. Under the deal between the CWU and the company, which averted strikes, more than 130,000 employees would receive a three-year pay rise worth around 9 per cent and legally-binding employment protections. But there has been controversy over the . salary of Ms Greene, amid recent reports that Business Secretary Vince . Cable wants to block any rise of more than 3 per cent for the chief . executive. The Government still owns a substantial chunk of the company. Royal Mail's chief executive Moya Greene said the company needed to improve its efficiency 'in order to effectively compete in the letters and parcels markets' Labour has accused the Government of a 'botched privatisation' of Royal Mail, saying taxpayers have been short-changed by hundreds of millions of pounds. The market value of the company soared on . privatisation last October, when shares were valued at 330p, though Mr . Cable dismissed the steep rise when they began trading as 'froth'. 'It's more proof that Royal Mail's primary reason for existing is now about making profits rather than serving the nation' - Unite union's Royal Mail officer Brian Scott . However, they have remained well above £5, helping the company enter the FTSE 100 index of top London-listed companies by valuation. Last night they closed at 584p. Communication Workers Union deputy general secretary Dave Ward said: 'Royal Mail's plan to cut 1,600 staff would see major changes to the company and are deeply concerning. 'We understand that the majority of these job losses will mainly be head office managerial staff rather than postal workers but we will fight to protect as many jobs as possible. 'We are yet to see how many employees in CWU-represented grades will be affected.'","Royal Mail due to begin consultations with unions over move to cut jobs .

"By . Mark Duell . Women trying to donate to Cancer Research UK as part of the #nomakeupselfie craze have found themselves accidentally trying to adopt a polar bear, it was revealed today. The fault has been happening when some givers' smartphones autocorrect the word ‘BEAT’ to read ‘BEAR’ and end up sending a message of interest in adoption to the World Wildlife Fund. In addition, £18,625 donated during the . craze has accidentally been sent to the United Nations agency Unicef by people texting ‘DONATE’ rather than ‘BEAT’, followed by the number 70099. #nomakeupselfies: Celebrities including models Amy Willerton (left) and Helen Flanagan (right) have joined in with the craze, although it is not believed they made the donating mistake . Getting involved: Australian singer Samantha Jade, whose mother has cancer, posted a no make-up selfie . 'I woke up like dis': Cheryl Cole joined the trend by posting a picture of herself on Instagram, despite appearing to be wearing a hint of eye make-up in the snap and not including the hashtag #nomakeupselfie . Tens of thousands of women have taken to posting photos of their make-up free faces online, alongside a £3 donation, which has helped raise more than £8million for the cancer charity. And Unicef . is now working with Cancer Research UK to transfer the . mistakenly-donated funds, while the WWF said no money was taken from . people who had enquired about adoption by mistake. A . Unicef UK spokesman told BBC News: ‘Unicef is not responsible for this . error, however we've been working hard to find a resolution to the . situation for those affected. ‘""DONATE . to 70099"" is an SMS keyword and shortcode combination that Unicef have . sole use of, specifically for any members of the public who contact us . and wish to donate to us via SMS.’ The . WWF stated any texts accidentally it received would not become . donations helping to protect polar bears, because the charity has ‘human . operators calling people back to confirm adoptions’. A . spokesman said: ‘We wish Cancer Research UK every success in their . campaign and their goals. Polar bear selfies are harder to come by, . though, as far as we are aware, none wear make-up.’ Mistake: Some people have even made an enquiry about adopting a polar bear from the World Wildlife Fund, after their smartphones autocorrected the word 'BEAT' to read 'BEAR' Reasoning: Dancer Felixy Splits says it's not only important to raise awareness but to donate anything you can . Nobody seems to know when it started . or why, but the take-up of the #nomakeupselfie craze has been . astonishing, perhaps even more so as it was a trend that was not started . by the charity. Celebrities such as models Amy Willerton and Helen Flanagan and singer Kym Marsh have joined in. The . craze was not orchestrated by Cancer Research, but it quickly . uploaded its own make-up-free selfie of a staff member holding a sign . reading: ‘This campaign isn’t ours but every £ helps.’ In the 24 hours after it posted that . photo, 800,000 donations were made and £1million raised. Some men have . also followed suit with their own versions, posting pictures of their . faces in make-up. However, . some Twitter and Facebook users have reacted angrily to the trend, with . one user writing: ‘Because not wearing make-up is like....having cancer? I hope I’m missing the point here.’ Carolan . Davidge, Cancer Research UK's director of communications, said: ‘We're . really grateful to everyone who donated to Cancer Research UK through . the #nomakeupselfie campaign. Online postings: Lisa Shepherd, left, put her no makeup selfie on Facebook, as did Laura Peters on the right .

Polar bear selfies are harder to come by, though, as far as we are aware, none wear make-up' World Wildlife Fund spokesman . Cancer Research UK said the donations will allow the charity to carry out 10 clinical trials which it did not have money to fully fund last week. Harpal Kumar, chief executive of Cancer Research UK, said: ‘We've been overwhelmed by the support people have been showing us through the #nomakeupselfie trend. ‘We don't receive any government funding for our research and so it's phenomenal to think that the generosity of the public is enabling us to fund critical research that we didn't have the money for six days ago. ‘Being able to fund more trials will bring forward the day when all cancers are cured. It's been an exciting week, and we'd just like to thank everyone again for their support.’ Cancer Research UK wants people to text BEAT to 70099 to donate £3 or visit www.cruk.org.","Some people's smartphones autocorrected the word 'BEAT' to 'BEAR'

"By . Lizzie Parry . A father who allegedly abandoned his two children in the wreckage of a car crash after they were seriously injured, has been arrested by police. Detectives believe Umbar Ali was driving a Vauxhall Zafira, which was involved in a collision with an Alfa Romeo in Bradford, West Yorkshire on Saturday night. Two children, aged two and four, were discovered by police officers in the Zafira alone. They were taken to hospital with serious injuries. Accident: Two children, aged two and four, were left in the wreckage of a Vauxhall Zafira following a crash in Manningham, Bradford. Police investigating launched a hunt for Umbar Ali, 39, believed to be the father of the children and driver of the Zafira, who allegedly fled the scene . Officers believe Ali, 39, from Bradford is the father of the youngsters. The accident happened in Queen's Road at the junction with Valley Road, Manningham, at around 9.30pm. Ali is thought to have fled the scene, sparking a manhunt. A spokesman for West Yorkshire Police said: 'We can confirm a 39-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the incident.' He said the man has been detained on suspicion of failing to stop at the scene of an accident. Officers had been concerned that Ali may have been injured in the accident and could require treatment in hospital. Two people in the Alfa Romeo, aged 34 and 32, were freed from the vehicle by firefighters and taken to hospital with suspected spinal injuries and a broken collar bone. A fire service spokesman described the collision as a 'fairly high-speed impact'. One woman is understood to have suffered a broken collarbone in the accident. Firefighters called to the scene of the crash, cut the roof from the Alfa Romeo to free the female passenger and male driver. A fire service spokesman said the man was suffering from suspected spinal injuries. The road was closed for about three hours after the crash. Inspector Joanne Field, of West Yorkshire Police's Western Area Roads Policing Unit, has urged anyone with information to contact the unit on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

"By . Ray Massey . If punctuality is your thing, this is not the flight for you. A budget airline’s mid-afternoon flight from Luton to Budapest hasn’t left on time once in the last nine months. The last time Wizz Air flight W62206 departed on time was June 1, 2013. That equates to 293 consecutive late departures, according to flight data specialists EUclaim. Wizz Air's mid-afternoon flight from Luton to Budapest has not left on time once in the last nine months (file picture) The report says of the 3hr 25min flight which is scheduled to leave at 2.20pm or 2.25pm depending on the day: ‘Wizz Air flight W62206 from Luton to Budapest has never left on time since 1st June 2013 with 293 consecutive late departures.’ The EUclaim report notes: ‘Making the 927 mile journey every day except Christmas Day, the late-running A320 plane has seen passengers delayed anywhere between two minutes and 12 hours and 18 minutes. ‘On one occasion it was even cancelled altogether. The daily delays add up to over 176 hours of waiting for unlucky passengers.’ However Wizz Air insists that its punctuality is much better than claimed when measured against the industry standard applied by the UK’s Civil Aviation Authority which define all flights departing within 15 minutes of the scheduled departure time as being ‘on time’. It claims commercial ‘bounty hunters such as EU Claims mislead consumers by hiding this fact’. It added that in the few cases where a flight takes off 15 minutes later than scheduled, consumers are mainly interested in arriving on time. A Wizz Air spokesman said: ‘Some 73.22 per cent of all 295 W62206 flights from London Luton to Budapest from 1 June 2013 to date departed on time, with 78.64 per cent arriving on time in Budapest.’ The last time Wizz Air flight W62206 departed on time was June 1, 2013. File picture shows passengers queuing for departures at Luton airport, north of London, on December 22, 2009 . But flight delay compensation specialist Bott & Co said passengers on nine of the late-running Wizz Air flights would be able to claim compensation under EU Regulation 261/2004. Some 15 individuals from the qualifying flights (in June, July, October and November 2013) have already approached the law firm to represent them against the airline and are in line to receive £215 (€250) each. EU regulation 261 entitles travellers to compensation of between €250 (£215) and €600 (£520) if their flight is delayed by more than three hours, cancelled, or they are denied boarding. The law applies to flights from EU airports or arriving in the EU on an EU airline, provided the delay or cancellation is not due to extraordinary circumstances. Paul Hinchliffe, managing partner at Bott & Co said: ‘Consumers in other EU countries tend to be familiar with their rights under Regulation 261, but that’ s not the case here in the UK. ‘We want to change this and help the British public to know their rights and receive the compensation rightly due to them for flight delays and cancellations.’","Last time the flight left on time was on June 1, 2013, according to EUclaim .

"By . Harriet Arkell . A mother and grandmother of two died in agony seven months after a stand-in consultant operated on her in the wrong place, causing huge blood loss and brain damage. Lalitaben Patel, 71, suffered a massive haemorrhage after mistakes by Mudhafar Alhiwidi, during a routine gall bladder procedure at the Leicester Royal Infirmary, resulted in three holes in a major artery. Theatre staff assisting the surgeon became so concerned after he spent two hours 'operating in completely the wrong place' that they called in a senior surgeon to come and finish the procedure, according to a report by the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust. He completed the operation, removing 90 . per cent of Mrs Patel's gall bladder, but the report said that errors . made by Mr Alhiwidi, who had only been at the hospital for two weeks, . had already caused huge blood loss, resulting in damage to Mrs Patel's . brain. Tragedy: Lalitaben Patel, 71, died after a botched routine gall bladder operation at Leicester Royal Infirmary . Mrs Patel's condition deteriorated significantly after the operation at Leicester Royal Infirmary in May 2012, and she died in December 2012 after months of agony. A letter sent from the trust to Mrs Patel’s family following an official investigation stated that Mr Alhiwidi 'should not have been anywhere near this artery.  He was operating in completely the wrong place'. The grandmother of two's family criticised the hospital for failures relating to her care, including a lack of ‘robust’ supervision to determine Mr Alhiwidi’s skills as a surgeon. Daughter Dipika Patel, 40, said: 'He’d only been at the hospital for two weeks, with limited checks regarding his capability as a consultant. 'Because of the hospital’s failure to assess his ability, my mum died.' At an inquest held earlier this month into Mrs Patel’s death, Leicester coroner Catherine Mason returned a narrative verdict. She said the medical evidence was that the dissection during the initial stages of the gall bladder operation was inappropriate and led to a massive secondary haemorrhage. 'This in turn led to Mrs Patel suffering problems after her surgery, the injury to her brain and ultimately her death on December 20, 2012 at the Leicester General Hospital,' added Mrs Mason. Mrs Patel was otherwise fit and healthy when she went into Leicester Royal Infirmary for the operation . The cause of death was given as sepsis, catheter-related urinary tract infection, cirrhosis and complications following the gall bladder operation, including lack of oxygen to the brain. The case prompted the coroner to write to the Department of Health calling managers to take steps to prevent similar tragedies happening in future. Mrs Mason wrote: 'Evidence revealed that the systems in place for signing off a locum consultant as competent to undertake independent practice were not as robust as they should have been.' She said the trust had now changed both its recruitment process and the processes for signing off a locum consultant as competent, but said some other hospital trusts still had less stringent practices. The coroner added: 'Accordingly, there is a real risk that what happened in this case could happen elsewhere. 'There is a real risk that what happened in this case could happen elsewhere - action should be taken to prevent future deaths' Catherine Mason, Leicester coroner, in a letter to the Department of Health . 'In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths, and I believe your organisation has the power to take such action.' Dipika Patel claimed the infirmary had failed her mother in numerous aspects of her care and left her 'in a mess' until the day she died. She said: 'The hospital failed to diagnose problems, failed to give her treatment, left her waiting for more than 10 hours in a wheelchair, soaked in bile and refused her pain medication. 'We’ve been given a letter of apology, but I’m shocked that these failures could happen in a modern hospital.' In a statement apologising to the family, Dr Kevin Harris, medical director of Leicester’s hospitals, said: 'On behalf of the members of staff who were involved in Mrs Patel’s care, I offer my heartfelt apologies and deepest condolences. 'Since the events of last year, we have changed our vetting process for locum surgeons to ensure that they are capable of operating to the same high standard as the surgeons we employ directly.' The trust confirmed that Mr Alhiwidi had his contract terminated and was reported to the General Medical Council, which has imposed temporary restrictions on his licence to practice while further investigations are carried out. As a result, Mr Alhiwidi, who is now believed to be working as a locum surgeon elsewhere, must be supervised when performing laparoscopic surgery, and is not allowed to practise privately.","Lalitaben Patel, 71, had gall bladder surgery at Leicester Royal Infirmary .

"By . Oona Mashta . Miriam Heyburn used to despair over her excruciating migraines, which struck every other day. 'I suffered from headaches since I was eight years old,' says Miriam, a retired court reporter from Croydon, Surrey, now in her 60s. 'They were so overwhelmingly painful that I never fully engaged with people at work. I had a reputation for being quiet and moody, but, in fact, I was trying to cope with the pain in my head.' Miriam Heyburn uses a Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) portable device to relieve her migraines . For years, Miriam relied on strong painkillers to cope, but worried about the long-term effects. However, more recently she's been offered a new drug-free treatment which has reduced the severity of her migraines, and allowed her to cut back on her medication. Miriam has been treated with trans-cranial magnetic stimulation, where magnetic pulses are directed into the head. Doctors are unsure exactly how TMS works in treating migraine, but one theory is that it stops abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Earlier this year, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) said there is enough scientific evidence to support the use of the treatment for the prevention and treatment of migraine. Migraines affect one in four women and one in 12 men in the UK. Although the cause is not known, they involve sudden contraction and then dilation of blood vessels in the brain. Unlike a normal headache, they are often accompanied by additional symptoms such as nausea, sensitivity to light, noise, touch and smell. They can also be preceded by aura, which can include flashing lights, zigzag lines in front of the eyes, and numbness or tingling in the limbs. Pressing a button on the handle emits a single painless magnetic pulse . For Miriam, who sometimes felt nauseous when she had a migraine, standard painkillers had no effect. So she took the strongest medication, known as triptans, which work by causing the blood vessels around the brain to contract. But as she reached her mid-50s, her headaches worsened, becoming more frequent and more severe, lasting two or three days at a time and often confining her to bed. If she was at work when a migraine hit, she would often have to rest in the sick room. And she was struggling with the side-effects of triptans, which can include nausea, a tight feeling in the chest and a 'spaced-out' feeling. 'It was like having a permanent headache - it was unbearable,' she says. 'I always carried my tablets with me. If I didn't take one I couldn't function. I couldn't take a day off work every time I had a headache or I'd never have been there. 'But the tablets made me feel as though I was walking in lead or wading through treacle. I had to take them so often that I was concerned what the long-term  side-effects could be. 'I tried acupuncture and head massage to try to cut down on the medication, but they  didn't help.' In 2011, Miriam's GP referred her to a specialist headache clinic at London's Charing Cross Hospital, where she was seen by consultant neurologist Dr  Mark Weatherall. She was prescribed various strong medications, including some usually used for treating epilepsy - thought to dampen down over-activity in the cells involved in generating migraine - but to no avail. Then last June Dr Weatherall suggested she tried TMS. There are no known serious side-effects and the device is easy and safe to use, according to doctors. Patients hold the portable device - which is about the weight of a brick and has a handle at each end - against their head at the base of the skull. Pressing a button on the handle emits a single painless magnetic pulse. This passes through the skull at the back of the head and into the brain. The number, strength, frequency and duration of pulses can also be adjusted for each individual user. In a U.S. clinical trial with 164 patients treated with TMS for at least one attack of migraine, 40 per cent were pain-free after two hours. After 24 hours, 29 per cent were still pain free, and after 48 hours 27 per cent were still pain free. The results were presented to a meeting of the American Headache Society in 2008. In a separate study in Canada, three-quarters of patients with migraine who were treated repeatedly with TMS suffered fewer headaches. Some patients reported tingling in the head and light-headedness, but these typically lasted no longer than 30 minutes; there were no serious side-effects. 'About two-thirds of patients find the device helpful in reducing the intensity and/or the duration of their migraines,' says Dr Weatherall. This is a 'breakthrough' treatment for those who cannot tolerate or do not respond to current treatment, says consultant neurologist Dr Fayyaz Ahmed, a trustee of The Migraine Trust. 'It opens the door for a new era in treating migraine headaches. We welcome NICE guidance and very much hope this treatment will be made available to those in need.' For Miriam, there was one overwhelmingly good reason to give it a go. 'I was keen to try it because it was drug free,' she says. Three-quarters of patients with migraine who were treated repeatedly with TMS suffered fewer headaches . After attending the headache clinic to learn how to operate it, she was allowed to take the device home to use whenever she felt a headache coming on, and is thrilled with the results. 'The device is marvellous. As soon as I started using it, my headaches became less frequent and less severe. I now often go ten days without suffering from a headache, which is such a relief. It has transformed my life. 'I still sometimes have to take a tablet for my headache, but not as often as before.' The treatment's effectiveness depends on how soon it is given, the number of pulses and the patient's individual pattern of migraine symptoms. For most patients, it can take a few weeks to work out the optimal treatment pattern. One possible downside is to do with practicality. 'It is a bit bulky, and its batteries have to be kept charged,' Dr Weatherall says. 'It does make a loud bang when you trigger it, but it's easy to use,' adds Miriam. 'You don't have to hold it for very long and it's done its job. I just wish it wasn't so heavy because I can't carry it when I go out. 'However, I still take my tablets everywhere with me, so I can take one if I get a headache when I'm out.' Under NICE guidelines issued in January this year, TMS is approved for the treatment or prevention of migraine episodes in patients with acute or chronic migraine, with or without aura. However, it is available only through specialist headache centres and is mostly restricted to patients who cannot use other forms of acute migraine treatment - for instance, who find drug treatment intolerable or for those who want to take fewer drugs for their migraine - during pregnancy, for example. However, patients who have either a pacemaker or epilepsy should not use the device. For Dr Weatherall, the gadget gives 'a glimpse of the future of migraine treatment'. 'It has an excellent safety record, and is a great option for patients who can't take standard painkillers or migraine treatments because of other medical issues. 'Understanding exactly how the TMS device works is opening up new avenues of research into migraine, which may in turn lead to new treatments for this common and disabling disorder.' www.migrainetrust.org .","Miriam Heyburn uses Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation portable device .

"By . Dai Davies, former Metropolitan Police Chief Superintendent . PUBLISHED: . 20:17 EST, 24 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 02:40 EST, 25 March 2014 . Public trust in the police is one of the essential ingredients of a well-ordered society. As a former senior officer myself, I can only regret how badly the police's reputation for integrity has been tarnished in recent years. Now another shattering blow has come with the revelations by this paper about an undercover three-year investigation into serious criminal behaviour and corruption by a group of trusted detectives in the Metropolitan Police. It appears that much of the evidence of this behaviour — such as files, videos and photographs — may have been deliberately shredded by Scotland Yard in 2003 in an attempt to thwart the anti-corruption investigation. The refusal to risk tarnishing the reputation of the Met has led to a deeply troubling culture of cover-ups. Scroll down for video . It took more than 18 years to bring two of Stephen Lawrence's (left) killers to justice. Daniel Morgan was killed with an axe in the car park of a South London pub in 1987. No-one has been brought to justice for his murder . What makes these findings all the more shocking is the possibility that this web of dishonesty could have undermined Scotland Yard's inquiries into two high-profile murder cases: that of the black teenager Stephen Lawrence and of the private eye Daniel Morgan, who was killed with an axe in the car park of a South London pub in 1987. At the time of his murder, which still remains unsolved 27 years later, Morgan was carrying out his own investigation into alleged corruption within South London detective squads. Previous official inquiries into the disastrously botched handling of the Stephen Lawrence murder case have already exposed an insidious police culture of deceit, malpractice, racial prejudice and incompetence. Now the Home Secretary has ordered another inquiry, this one into serious allegations that the Metropolitan Police sent in undercover officers to spy secretly on the Lawrence family in the aftermath of Stephen's death in 1993. This new outrage follows other major recent scandals which have shown the police at their worst. Abuses . One was the notorious Plebgate incident in which officers on duty in Downing Street allegedly conspired to destroy the career of Cabinet Minister Andrew Mitchell by making false accusations against him. Apart from the corruption itself, one of the features common to all these appalling incidents is the apparent impulse to cover up the wrong-doing, to close ranks, to frustrate and mislead investigators. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe will be quizzed by the Home Affairs Select Committee . Time after time, the instinct of the police is not to face up to the challenge of abuses in their midst, but to pretend that they do not exist. Log books are distorted; statements manufactured. In many of these cases — Plebgate is just one example  — the cover-up and all that goes with it turn out to be worse than the original crime. One of the more depressing aspects of these recent scandals is that they are so reminiscent of the dark days of the Seventies, when many police forces were riddled with abuses. We had been promised that such misconduct had been consigned to the dustbin of history, that a new era of scrupulously honest policing had arrived. But the Mail's stories about the shredding of 'lorry loads' of documents and the taking of bribes could have come straight from the police force of 40 years ago, when I was a young officer. Then, just as today, the vast majority of my colleagues were honourable, decent people who had joined the force to fight crime and protect the public. Corruption, though undoubtedly practised by a few bad apples, was not endemic. Nevertheless, there was a powerful 'canteen culture' which meant that wrong-doers were often protected, particularly within certain elements of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) and some specialist regional squads. They looked after their own, hostile to any outsiders or to scrutiny of their methods. Detective Inspectors were treated like gods by their men, which fed their sense of invincibility and their belief that they were a law unto themselves. In this climate, a small but significant minority were willing to bend the law, sometimes to get results, sometimes for their own selfish ends. A few even became allies of criminals. They 'fitted up' innocent men so that the guilty would go free or ensured that charges were dropped. In return for cash, they gave criminal gangs warnings of imminent raids or arrests. They were willing to lie on oath, siphon off their share of money for informants and even share in the proceeds of drug deals and robberies. Heroic . It was this culture that Sir Robert Mark was determined to smash when he took over as Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police in 1972, having already won a reputation as a radical reformer when serving as Chief Constable of Leicester. Sir Robert was a man I admired tremendously because of his natural authority, his straight talking and his determination. When he said he was going to root out corruption, he meant it. One of his most acerbic pronouncements, which reflected the prevalence of dishonesty in the early Seventies, was: 'A good police force is one which catches more crooks than it employs.' Sir Robert Mark was determined to smash when he took over as Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police in 1972 . As a result of his heroic efforts to reform the Met, more than 500 officers were dismissed or forced to resign. Jail sentences were given to two chiefs: Commander Kenneth Drury of the Flying Squad and Detective Chief Superintendent Bill Moody, Head of the Obscence Publications Squad. Sir Robert's actions may have caused dismay to the corrupt cliques, but his resolute campaign was welcomed by officers like me who were fed up with the way the abusers were destroying the Met's image. Sadly, Sir Robert resigned in 1977 following a row with the Labour Government, his work still unfinished. None of his successors have matched him for resolution and guts. That was all too graphically demonstrated when another investigation into Metropolitan Police corruption was held between 1978 and 1982 in the wake of Sir Robert's reforms. Called Operation Countryman, it was conducted by detectives from Hampshire and Dorset. These men complained bitterly that their investigation had been wilfully obstructed by both the Metropolitan Commissioner Sir David McNee and by the Director of Public Prosecutions Sir Thomas Hetherington. It was the same story in the mid-Nineties, when I was a Chief Superintendent. Throughout this period, the Commissioner Sir Paul Condon trumpeted his commitment to another anti-corruption drive within his force, but I sensed it was all just empty words. So I decided to challenge him. 'How many senior officers have actually been dismissed for corruption?' I asked. The answer? None. That says it all. Since Sir Robert Mark's courageous fight, real leadership has been sorely lacking at the top of the Met. That is why corrupt coppers have been able to get away with it for far too long. Since my retirement from the force, I have experienced the police's behaviour from the other side. Acting as a security consultant and adviser, I was involved in a case where the police wanted a central London nightclub to lose its licence because of allegations of disorderly behaviour. Attack . In court, I was one of the witnesses for the nightclub. I made a list of recommendations on how the club could be better run. What amazed me was how the police, opposing my stance, were willing to undermine my record, attack my credibility as an expert, and even wrongly question my former rank to ensure that they won their argument. If the police were willing to do this to me, who had once been in charge of protecting the Queen and the Royal Family, what might they be willing to do to an ordinary member of the public? Sir Robert Mark almost succeeded in cleaning up the Augean stables of the force 40 years ago. Will the present-day Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe be up to the job? If the news reports of recent days are anything to go by, the task remains Herculean.","Police's reputation for integrity has been tarnished in recent years .

"By . Paul Donnelley . Tough boots saved a bricklayer’s feet when a 10-ton bus ran over them. Doctors told Robert Phillips, 27, that they would have had to amputate them both, if his steel toe caps had not withstood the weight of the packed rush-hour single-decker. His left tibia and fibula snapped, and his ankle twisted 180 degrees, leaving his left foot back to front. Accident: Robert Phillips was walking from work when he was hit by a single decker bus. His left  tibia and fibula snapped, and his ankle twisted 180 degrees, leaving his left foot back to front . But the feet themselves were completely unscathed, thanks to his super-strong size nines, even though the wheels went over them both. Mr Phillips was walking home after his father dropped him off when the accident happened at 4.30pm on 12 February. An Arriva bus ran over the toes of his right foot and his lower left leg and foot, knocking him to the ground at a pelican crossing near the corner of Bangor Road and High Street, close to his home in Johnstown, Wrexham, North Wales. Homebound: Robert Phillips has a special cage built around his left leg to protect it and is unable to leave the house for fear his wounds might become infected; with the pair of boots that saved his feet. The manufacturers have sent him another pair . He fell against railings and landed on the road in front of the bus. Its front wheels went over him but stopped with just inches to spare before the rear ones crushed him. ‘A woman driver put a blanket over me and I was taken to Wrexham Maelor Hospital. I was there for six hours but my injuries were so severe they sent me to University Hospital of North Staffordshire at Stoke-on-Trent.’ Lisa Valentine, 23, of Ruabon, Wrexham, was on the scene moments after the accident.She said: ‘When I went out there was a lad lying on the floor and he was screaming. Damaged: The left windscreen of the Number 2 Arriva bus was cracked when it hit bricklayer Robert Phillips . Police closed the road last month in Wrexham when bricklayer Robert Phillips was hit by a bus that ran over his feet but left them unscathed because of his steel toe-capped boots . ‘He was in pain and he was getting gas and air from paramedics before they put him in the ambulance. ‘It looked like he had broken his leg. ‘The windscreen of the bus was smashed but he was lying at the back so I’m not sure if he was dragged by the bus.’ Mr Phillips has had a series of four operations so far, and doctors say it will be at least 15 months before the bones heal. ‘My tibia and fibula broke, my ankle was smashed to pieces and the whole left foot spun round 180 degrees,’ he said. Blues and twos: The scene of the accident when bricklayer Robert Phillips was hit by a bus as he walked home from work . ‘The doctors say I’m very lucky to have my feet. If I hadn’t been wearing steel toe-capped boots I would have lost them for sure. Thankfully they withstood the weight of the bus. ‘My feet don’t have a mark on them. I always wear proper work boots. I pay extra to get good ones, Scruffs, which are strong and comfy.’ Mr Phillips, who lives with girlfriend Stacey Roberts, 21, and son Evan, two, was discharged on March 3. He’s now on crutches but can’t leave his home because the open wound is prone to infection.He has a metal cage built around it, which will be replaced in future operations. ‘I don’t let it get me down,’ he said. ‘I’m very happy to be here at all, and to have my legs and my feet is a bonus.‘The docs said it was only thanks to medical advances in the last 10 years that they were able to save my leg.’ Mr Phillips was in such pain after his accident that he was twice given ketamine, a horse tranquilizer and used illegally in nightclubs. ‘I was tripping and talking gibberish,’ he said. ‘It was horrible.’ Emergency: Robert Phillips was in such pain after being hit by a bus as he walked home from work that he was given the horse tranquiliser ketamine . Mr Phillips wrote to Scruffs Workwear, the firm that made his boots, and told them they had saved his feet. They are sending him a new pair. Spokesman Chris Mellor-Dolman said: ‘All of our products are put through rigorous safety tests, and we’re not surprised that they stood up to a ten ton bus. Our gear is usually more at home on a work site, but it just goes to show that they can play hard too.’ A spokesman for Arriva Bus Midlands, which operates the service, said: ‘We are pleased to hear the good news regarding Mr Phillips and we wish him a speedy recovery following the incident in Johnstown.’","Robert Phillips, 27, was walking home from work in Wrexham when he was hit by the bus .

By a strange coincidence Mr Phillips’s father Nigel, 52, wasn’t so lucky with his boots. They failed to withstand the pressure in a forklift truck accident back in 1985.

"By . Sam Webb . The bodybuilding ex-boyfriend of a woman stabbed to death told friends and a mistress he would kill his former partner so 'no one else' could have her, an inquest heard. Tragic Gabrielle Stanley, 28, was brutally knifed at the Doncaster, South Yorkshire, home she had shared with steroid user Simon Hall, 36, on October 26 last year. She sustained 30 stab wounds in the attack and died at Doncaster Royal Infirmary later that night. Hall was also found dead at the scene and a post-mortem revealed the cause of death to be hanging. Gabrielle Stanley (left) who was found dead at her Doncaster home with ex-partner Simon Hall (right). She had been stabbed 30 times . An inquest at Doncaster Crown Court heard today that six weeks before Gabrielle was stabbed she had split up with Hall because of his infidelity and his continued steroid abuse. Despite giving Gabrielle space to begin with, Hall started to obsessively try and win Gabrielle back and even threatened suicide to get her round to his house, the inquest heard. Numerous friends and Katie Wath, with whom Hall had been having an affair with, noticed his behaviour change in the weeks leading up to the pair’s death. A statement from Miss Wath told the inquest: 'Simon was a very jealous man. He told me [after the split] ""no one else can have Gabs, I’m going to kill Gabs"".' Hall was also found dead at the scene and a post-mortem revealed the cause of death to be hanging . A statement from John Hall, one of the bodybuilder's close friends, recalled a conversation the two men had in the weeks before the deaths: 'He told me he was following Gabrielle on . his push bike. He didn’t really elaborate but said he’s been following . her. 'He was asking why she had left him over and over again. 'Simon said he couldn’t handle the thought of Gabrielle going out with anyone else. He said to me ""if I find out she is seeing someone else I will kill her then I will kill them"".' The inquest heard Hall had been going out with Gabrielle for 10 years and lived with him Doncaster for three years. Police were called to a 'disturbance' at the property, where they found Ms Stanley with multiple stab injuries . On the night of the deaths Gabrielle had been . to visit Hall to discuss the possibility of buying his share of the . mortgage and keeping the house they had shared together. Despite . the meeting being a strictly business occasion, the inquest heard that . Simon was very happy about Gabrielle coming over and had prepared a . meal, got some alcohol and had a DVD for the pair to watch. But at approximately 10pm, neighbours on the street where the pair had lived recalled hearing a woman screaming for help. Neighbour Daniel Cutts said: 'I had the window open because it was a humid night and heard a female screaming ‘""help me help me help me"" as I went to look out the window there was a female lying on the street. At approximately 10pm, neighbours on the street where the pair had lived recalled hearing a woman screaming for help . 'I waited and a male came out of the house and dragged the female back into the house her body was limp and her feet were dragging along the floor. 'I shouted ""Gabby, is that you Gabby?"" and the man came out and said she had had too much to drink.' As Daniel worked with Gabrielle’s mother, Deborah, he made contact with the family and told them to get round fast as something had happened. A statement from a witness who saw the attack happening in the house between 10pm and 10.45pm - but who cannot be named for legal reasons - was read out in court. It said: 'She heard what is described as a high pitched scream. She heard the words ""stop it, please don’t"" and saw the woman curled up on the floor, laid on her side with her back against the wall. 'She saw a man walk up and then crouch over her before he started to punch and hit her.' Emergency services were called by neighbours on the street, who attended the address minutes later and discovered Hall dead and Gabrielle with severe stab wounds and covered in blood. Recording a verdict of unlawful killing for Gabrielle Stanley at Doncaster Crown Court, Coroner Nicola Mundy said: 'Gabrielle Stanley had been in a long-term relationship with [Hall] and had resided with him until six weeks before her death when she chose to end the relationship. 'Their relationship had been difficult for a long time due to [Hall's] relationships with other women, the fact that he spent a considerable time in the gym and used steroids, which affected his behaviour and made him aggressive.' Ms Mundy said that she was certain that Gabrielle had no intention of reconciling her relationship with Hall when she went over to the house they formerly shared to discuss finances. However, the inquest heard that Hall was 'obsessive' in his attempts to win Gabrielle back and was sure that she would return to him one day. Ms Mundy added: 'I consider that at some point in the evening her partner had seen the phone and realised Gabrielle was in another relationship and his hopes of reconciliation would come to nothing and that led him to carry out a severe and sustained attack on Gabrielle.'Ms Mundy recorded a verdict of suicide for Simon Hall.

A man is wanted by police on suspicion of beheading a swan and stuffing it in his bag at a picturesque lake. The unnamed man seen wearing a red jacket, was seen stuffing the lifeless body of a swan into his red and black rucksack at 18-acre Bennett’s Lake in Hildenborough, Kent. It's not known why the man took the swan, but some locals have speculated that he may have wanted it for his dinner. The amateur photographer who took the picture of the man allegedly stealing the swan last week, passed it onto his friend, wildlife lover Steve Robinson - who immediately handed it in to Kent Police for further investigation. Mr Robinson said: 'This b****** is killing swans in the Tonbridge area, here he is after putting one in his bag.' Mr Robinson said his friend was fishing at the popular lake when he spotted the man apparently attack the swan on March 18, at around 4pm, cutting its head off at the bottom of the neck so it would fit into his rucksack. The onlooker rushed over to tell the man to stop, but it was too late and the swan had already been decapitated and slung into the rucksack. The man then ran off when he realised that someone had spotted him. Kent Police have launched an investigation, but said no arrests have been made.

"By . John Hall . Lembit Opik has contacted the police to report an assault after having coloured powder thrown at him during a Hindu festival. The former Liberal Democrat MP turned television presenter, 49, was filming a segment for the Iranian government owned PressTV outside a college in Bloomsbury in Central London when three young men threw the substance at him before running away. Despite powder-throwing being an integral part of the ancient Indian festival of Holi, Mr Opik told MailOnline that he did not believe the men were taking part in the celebrations and said he saw 'no benign cultural or religious significance' to the 'shocking' and 'unprovoked' attack. Attack: Lembit Opik had coloured powder thrown at him during a religious festival today . Mr Opik said he believed the three men who carried out the 2pm assault were 'white males in their late teens or early 20s', adding that he did not know what their motivation was. He said onlookers were left stunned by the attack, adding that although students celebrating Holi in the area, 'there was no doubt that it was nothing whatsoever to do with the religious and cultural celebration going on at the time.' 'There's absolutely no possibility whatsoever that they though that I or anyone else in that particular locality had anything to do with the powder-throwing element of the religious ceremony,' he added. Mr Opik said he felt the attack was 'entirely opportunistic' and had been designed either to attack him either for political reasons, because he is a recognisable figure, or in order to disrupt the filming. 'People not known to me all unanimously agreed that it was a shocking incident,' he added. Mr Opik said that although some of the powder went in to his eye, there was no lasting effect and he did not not require medical assistance. Fun: Powder-throwing is an integral part of the ancient Indian festival of Holi and is celebrated by students from University College London and the School of Oriental and African Studies' Hindu Society (pictured) Describing the substance, Mr Opik told . MailOnline: 'Quite possibly the powder they used was the same powder . being used for the religious festival, but it wasn't being used in that . context.' 'It was being used . because either they recognised me, or they recognised what I was doing, . and they decided to play a rather stupid and ill-considered prank.' Holi is an ancient spring festival in the Hindu calender that is also known as 'The Festival of Colours' or 'The Festival of Love'. Although primarily observed in India and Nepal, the celebrations have attracted revelers from around the world in recent years thanks to the bright colours and joyful atmosphere. The colour aspect of the festival is believed to come from an ancient Hindu legend that Krishna was worried the fair-skinned deity Radha would not love him due to his blue skin. Despairing of her son, the legend says Krishna's mother Devaki allows him to change Radha's skin colour to whatever he chooses. One key aspect in the Holi celebrations is the large 'carnival of the colour' that takes place on the morning after the Holika bonfire. During the carnival, worshipers chase each other and throw coloured powder, paint and water balloons. Everyone near the carnival is considered fair game, with revelers often attacking strangers and the elderly with the coloured paint. It is believed that students from Hindu Societies at University College London and the School of Oriental and African Studies had organised Holi celebrations in the Bloomsbury area when Mr Opik's assault took place. 'I . can't be sure of their motivations  - I'm simply sure their motivations . weren't to embrace me in the religious celebrations going on at the . time,' he added. Mr Opik said the . police agreed with him that an assault had taken place and said a number . of witnesses came forward to assist to assist the investigation. However Scotland Yard said their investigation has already been closed 'pending the receipt of any new information'. Mr Opik said that his PressTV team, who had been filming a section for Mr . Opik's weekly half-hour programme, had lost the entire day's filming as a . result of the attack. 'You . can't film when you're covered in paint. People will think you're some . kind of an art installation or that I'm making some kind of an artistic . statement. It may have won me a Turner award but it wasn't going to win . me a Bafta,' he told MailOnline. In the aftermath of the attack, Mr Opik said: 'I think Iâ€™m known for having a sense of . humour but frankly this kind of thing is incomprehensibly stupid. I . wonder if the people who did it will think it was funny enough to . deserve the convictions which they are likely to get as a result.' Mr Opik went on to liken the attack on him the incident when then Prime Minister Tony Blair had purple paint thrown at him in the House of Commons by a Fathers For Justice protester. 'I think any politician who was in the chamber at the time they the powder at Tony Blair has still go a chilling recollection of that. Because that could have been anything.' 'No one in Britain could accuse me of being humourless and not being able to laugh at myself, but that's not the issue. The issue is that this kind of behaviour is at least is utterly stupid, and at worst could cause long term harm... where do you draw the boundaries?,' Mr Opik said. The attack on Mr Opik took place as students from University College London the School of Oriental and African studies (pictured) gathered in nearby Gordon Square for a three hour event to celebrate Holi (file image) Lembit Opik's career as a Liberal Democrat MP was often as remarkable for his cartoonish behaviour and well-known girlfriends than his political achievements. County Down-born Opik became Member of Parliament for Montgomeryshire in Wales in 1997, becoming leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats in 2001. In four successive Liberal Democrat leadership contests, Opik backed campaigns that collapsed, leading to talk of the 'curse of Lembit', and making his support for a prospective leader undesirable. Lembit Opik's career as an MP was often as remarkable for his well-known girlfriends (left with ITV weather forecaster Sian Lloyd, and right with Cheeky Girl Gabriela Irimia) than for his political achievements . On 13 April 1998 Opik came close to death in a near fatal paragliding accident, falling 80 feet onto a Welsh mountain in his constituency, and breaking his back in 12 places. Opik was in a relationship with ITV weather presenter Sian Lloyd for a number of years in the 2000s, with the couple coming close to marrying. However they split in October 2006, with Lloyd later blaming 'women and alcohol' and Opik's 'rowdy, drunken behaviour' for the split. Opik later started a relationship with then-24-year-old Gabriela Irimia of pop music double-act The Cheeky Girls. He announced their engagement after proposing in Rome, but the couple split in late 2008 after a 'difficult period'. While serving as an MP, Opik made regular appearances on comedic television programmes - chiefly Have I Got News For You. After failing to become the Liberal Democrats' nominee for Mayor of London in 2012, Opik took part in a wrestling match against professional fighter Kade Callous (pictured) He was openly ridiculed by stars Paul Merton and Ian Hislop after making an appearance on the show on the day after he lost his seat as an MP during the 2010 General Election. Vowing to take up comedy instead of politics, Opik made his debut as a stand-up at the Backstage Comedy Club in London's West End two months after losing his seat . Hi show was described by one audience member as 'not fantastic, but not completely awful', although a resulting tour saw increasingly small audience numbers. Two years later Opik put himself forward to be the Liberal Democrats' nominee for Mayor of London but was knocked out in the first round, receiving only 252 votes. The wrestling promoter said Opik lasted two minutes in the ring and was taken to hospital with minor injuries . Following the disappointment, Opik's next attempt to break into the entertainment industry saw him take part in a wrestling match against professional fighter Kade Callous. According to the promoter, Opik lasted about two minutes in the ring before being taken to hospital with minor injuries. Opik has since appeared on numerous reality television programmes, including Stand Up for the Week, Come Dine With Me, and I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! Mr Opik said he wanted to meet . his attackers to ask them why they carried out the attack in the hope of . proving it had nothing to do with the Hindu festival of Holi. 'Through . the pages of the Mail I would like to extend an invitation to the . people who did this. If you want to claim this was part of the . celebrations, come meet me and explain it to me.' 'I . will be happy to listen - with a Daily Mail reporter on hand to ensure . fairness - I would be happy to listen to why you thought it was a . reasonable thing to do.' The attack on Mr Opik took place as students from University College London and the School of Oriental and African Studies gathered in nearby Gordon Square for a three hour event to celebrate Holi. The festivities typically involve people throwing coloured powder at each other to celebrate the start of spring. Scotland Yard said that the investigation into the alleged assault had been closed pending the receipt of new information. 'Police were called to Russell Square, WC1, at 15.15hrs on 19 March following reports of an alleged common assault,' they said in a statement. 'It was alleged that three suspects approached the victim, a 49-year-old man, and threw a powder at him before running from the scene into a crowd of people. The victim did not require medical treatment. 'Officers from Camden borough began an investigation into the circumstances. This has since been closed pending the receipt of any new evidence or information.'","Former Lib Dem MP Lembit Opik had coloured powder thrown at him today .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . A cruel husband told his elderly wife 'prepare to meet your maker' before violently attacking her after she helped their son with his divorce. Ronald Needham, 86, tried to throttle his wife Sheila, 80, after he discovered she's helped their married son divorce his wife. Needham punched, slapped and even bit his wife of 61 years as she lay in bed during his 'cold and calculated' attack, a court was told. The violent, two-hour struggle occurred in the couple's Merseyside home in September last year. Ronald Needham, 86, beat his wife Sheila until she was 'black and blue' during a two-hour attack at the couple's Norris Green, Merseyside home (area pictured) The attack only came to an end after Needham 'ran out of energy' and his terrified wife, who had been beaten 'black and blue', managed to fend him off with a drawer. Liverpool Crown Court heard to the outside world the former soldier and Post Office worker seemed to 'a normal family man'. But in a victim impact statement Mrs Needham said 'at home he was a monster.' She said the man had been violent to her throughout their marriage - but she had never confessed to police. Needham denied attempted murder but admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent. Jailing Needham for five years with an extended sentence of two years, Judge Mark Brown described the attack as 'ferocious' and ruled that he poses a significant risk of serious harm to his wife. Judge Brown said: 'This was a sustained attack over a couple of hours . involving strangulation, punches, slaps, biting and effectively the use . of your teeth as a weapon. 'I . am satisfied you intended to inflict grievous bodily harm on her and it . is very fortunate that she was not more seriously hurt.’ He . added that Needham’s wife, 'is very fearful that when you are released . you will seek revenge. She is terrified of you and very concerned about . the future.' 'You have very limited remorse and no insight into the impact of your offending and the gravity of your conduct.' He also imposed a restraining order to keep away from Sheila who has started divorce proceedings. Mrs Needham told the court her husband will come after her following his release, stating: 'He will never let me go.' She added: 'I wish I had listened to his mother all those years ago. The only good things to come out of it is our sons Peter and Nigel.' Mrs Needham told the court she thought her husband would 'never let her go' and he would pursue her after he was released from prison. The former soldier was handed a 5-year sentence and a restraining order . Henry Riding, prosecuting, told the court how the attack took place at their home in Norris Green, Merseyside  on September 25 last year - the day after the couple's son Nigel came round to their home with his laundry. They began rowing before the son was forced to restrain his violent father. The man then told his father if he retaliated by taking things out on his mother he would 'floor' him, the court was told. Needham then told his wife: 'Don’t worry about me hitting you, I won’t, I’ll bide my time. I have plans for you.' At about 4am, Needham came into her bedroom, 'put her bedside light on and told her, ""prepare to meet your maker""' while wearing a sly grin on his face, jurors heard. 'She was still half asleep and he got on top of her and started to strangle her with his hands around her throat,' said Mr Riding. The court was told how, although not good on her legs, Mrs Needham's was able to raise her legs up and put them on his chest to push him off. While she was kicking out at him he was telling her 'I’ll have you'. He was trying to punch her and she grabbed a drawer from the dressing table and began hitting him with it, the court was told. Jurors heard how Mrs Needham was screaming out hoping a neighbour would hear - but realised she would not as she took her hearing aids out at night. She therefore started talking rubbish in a bid to calm him down. Fortunately he became wedged under the dressing table which restricted his movements and 'his energy sapped and he gave up,' the court was told . He then told her 'It’s over now, you have ruined my life. That is it now, I’ll be in there with druggies and what not'. Needham then rang the emergency services who arrived to find the blood stained room in disarray. Mrs Needham, now 81, suffered a bite to her right calf and toe and contusions and bruising to her face and body. 'She was black and blue and aching all over. Photographs showed injuries to an old lady who has been battered,' said Mr Riding. She had to be referred to an opthalmic surgeon because of a cut to her eye and the bite to her leg become infected and was still being treated for it in January this year. She described that as a 'daily reminder' of her ordeal and still has trouble sleeping fearing he might return even though she knew he was in custody. When interviewed by police, Needham claimed that the she had hurled a torrent of abuse at him and he defended himself. However, the court heard he no longer maintains his version of events. Peter Killen, defending, said that Needham suffers from epilepsy and is in poor health. He has been suffering from episodes of confusion and paranoia and is struggling in prison.","Ronald Needham, 86, punched, slapped and throttled his wife of 61 years .

"By . Wills Robinson . Two travellers who persuaded an elderly dementia sufferer to drop off £73,500 in cash at a bus stop or a lay-by have been jailed for a total of eight-and-a-half years. Father-of-six Hughie Doherty, 31, his brother Francis, 36, and the pair's brother-in-law David Young, conned the 84-year-old widow out of nearly all her life-savings by pretending to be solicitors. The men's scam was exposed when her bank manager became suspicious as they tried to extract £15,000 from the frail victim, who lived alone in the village of Blunham, Bedfordshire. Father of six Hughie Doherty, 31, was jailed for five years at Northampton Crown Court while his brother Francis is set to be sentenced at a later date. Both conned the elderly woman out of most of her life savings . The Doherty brothers, from Northamptonshire, denied playing any part in the theft of the money and said they made their living breeding a horse known as the Gypsy Cob. The woman, who was in the early stages of dementia, received a telephone call, in the summer of 2010, from a man calling himself Oliver, who spoke with a middle class, professional accent and said he was a solicitor. 'Oliver' claimed he could help her get back £25,000 she lost when she had fallen victim to a seperate scam. He also said they could retrieve money she had handed over to 'lawyers' after shoddy work had been carried out on her driveway in 2004. Again the victim was told she would have to pay for advanced legal services and, as a result, was persuaded to cash in her insurance policies. David Young, the pair's brother-in-law was jailed for three-and-a-half years for his part in the scam . In the months that followed, she got cash out of her bank account on eight occasions which, following instructions from the man, she put in envelopes and left at either a bus stop in Blunham or at a nearby lay-by. Between the summer of 2010 and February 2011 she handed over £73,500. Prosecutor David Stanton said none of the money had ever been recovered. He said: 'These despicable offences were a planned operation by three defendants who took advantage of an 84 year old woman who was suffering from dementia. 'She didn't confide in her family or say what was going on. No legal work was being carried out for her. 'She was being taken for the money. All the money was stolen from her.' In March 2011, Bedfordshire Police were alerted after the manager at a NatWest bank branch in Bedford became concerned. He checked her account and discovered the eight earlier withdrawals. The manager called her son, who contacted the police. A few days later the victim received a call from 'Oliver' telling her she should go to the bank that day and withdraw £15,000. A trap was set and police were watching when a green Landrover Discovery with three men inside was seen twice driving slowly past the woman's home. Not long afterwards it was involved in a short police chase before stopping. The three men were Inside the car, along with Young's mobile phone which had been dismantled. Mr McLouglin said a police sniffer dog and its handler later followed the route the Landrover had taken during the short chase and, as a result, three pieces of paper were found by the roadside. One had the name of the pensioner written on it together with her phone number. Drop-off: The men would make the frail woman leave money at a bus stop in Blunham or at a nearby lay-by . Fingerprints from Young and Francis Doherty were found on the documents and, when Young's mobile phone was analysed, officers discovered it had been used to make 13 calls to the woman's home that day. Francis Doherty, 36, from Wellingborough, Northamptonshire and his 31-year-old brother Hughie from Rushden pleaded not guilty to theft. They denied a second charge of attempting to steal £15,000 from her in March 2011 on the day of their arrest. But both were . convicted by a jury at Luton Crown Court at an earlier hearing. Young . pleaded guilty to the charges of theft and attempted theft. Home: The dementia sufferer lived on her own in the quiet village of Blunham in Bedfordshire . Concern: The alarm was raised when the bank managed at NatWest branch in Bedford noticed £15,000 had been withdrawn from the victim's account . At the time, Hughie Doherty was in breach of a 12 month sentence, suspended for two years, passed at Northampton Crown Court in  2010 for fraud by false representation. He had posed as a Trading Standard Officer and tried to extract £7,000 from a 72-year-old man. Judge Stuart Bridge sentenced Hughie Doherty to a total of five years in prison. He jailed father-of-one Young, a ground worker who had spent 11 months on remand in custody, to three-and-a-half years. He said: 'The fragile mental state of the victim was perfectly apparent. It was an audacious fraud, carefully planned and callously executed. You realised she was easy prey. You were insatiable and carried on taking, taking and taking.' The judge said the effect on the victim was 'appalling' and she will never recover. The judge adjourned sentencing on Francis Doherty, as his barrister was not present.

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Philip Barnwell, 36, who has been banned from teaching for life after he had an 'inappropriate' relationship with a year 11 pupil . A headteacher who had an affair with a 15-year-old pupil who he later got pregnant has been banned from teaching for life. Philip Barnwell, 36, plied the girl - known only as Pupil A - with alcoholic drinks, took her to the seaside, and let her share his bed, a professional conduct panel was told. The relationship continued after the girl left the school and she fell pregnant with the teacher's baby at 17, the hearing heard. An investigation in to the relationship was halted after Mr Barnwell was sacked from the school in 2008 as the girl refused to be interviewed and Mr Barnwell did not comment.However, details of the affair resurfaced when Mr Barnwell applied for another job in teaching and he was ordered to face a professional conduct hearing. The panel ruled while Mr Barnwell was . employed at Woodside High School in Wood Green, north London, between . 2007 and 2008, he had an inappropriate relationship with the Year 11 . student. This amounted to unacceptable professional conduct, it said. Mr Barnwell insists he is innocent and denies he had an inappropriate relationship with the girl. However, Alan Meyrick, deputy director for teacher regulation at the Department for Education, banned him from the profession for good. He said: 'Mr Barnwell abused the position of trust that he held and he engaged in sexual activity with Pupil A. 'This is very serious misconduct. I am satisfied that Mr Barnwell’s actions were both deliberate and, at times, carefully planned.' Mrs Mary Speakman, who chaired the hearing, said: 'The relationship is said to have involved the teacher frequently spending time alone with Pupil A in school time, communications by text and MSN between them, pre-arranged meetings outside school and overnight stays.' The panel also heard how the girl stayed at the head teacher’s home and shared his bed, while on another occasion they spent two nights together in the Royal York Hotel in Brighton during term-time. After she left the school in September 2008, they 'appeared very close' when spotted in a park together, the hearing was told. Later that month, Mr Barnwell took her to a hotel for the night and the next day the pair had to go to a clinic as the girl needed the morning-after pill. The hearing was told how Mr Barnwell . spoke about his relationship with the girl to another pupil who was in . her academic year. This pupil gave evidence, along with two teachers. According to the Sunday Mirror, a classmate said: 'He told me that they were in a relationship and loved each other.' Woodside High School, where Mr Barnwell was head teacher. The man gave pupil A alcohol, slept in the same bed as her and took her on trips to the seaside, a professional conduct panel heard . She also told the hearing: 'My friend slept in the bed with Mr Barnwell.' She added that gossip about the “inappropriate relationship” was all over school. Mr Barnwell was suspended from his post in July 2008 while the police and the school held investigations into his conduct. By this time, the pupil had just finished her GCSEs. He was eventually dismissed. Mrs . Speakman told the hearing: 'Our factual findings, taken together, . provide an abundance of evidence to establish that Mr Barnwell had a . relationship with Pupil A, one of his school pupils, which was totally . inappropriate and involved sexual activity.” Pupil giving evidence at hearing . The panel, run by the National College for Teaching and Leadership, heard the girl - described as 'bright and hard working' - came from a broken home. She had little contact with her natural mother and none with her father. Mrs Speakman added: 'Parents and others must be able to entrust children, particularly those who are vulnerable because of family or other circumstances, to the care of teachers, confident that teachers will observe professional boundaries towards those whom they teach. 'We conclude that the evidence in the case demonstrates conclusively that Mr Barnwell’s conduct renders him incompatible with remaining as a member of the profession and that a prohibition order should be imposed.' Mr Meyrick, acting on behalf of Education Secretary Michael Gove, said that the head teacher’s attitude showed 'a lack of acknowledgement of the seriousness of his behaviour, the damage caused to the collective reputation of the profession and the way that it undermines public confidence in the profession.' He said he had seen no evidence of insight or remorse. Mr Meyrick banned Mr Barnwell from teaching in any school, sixth form college, youth accommodation or children’s home in England. Mr Barnwell, who was present for part of the hearing, denied the facts of the case and denied he had had an inappropriate relationship with the girl. Asked about the case earlier, he said: 'I am innocent, but as the term ""inappropriate relationship"" is not clearly defined in either the school handbook or in government guidelines, I feel that, regardless of any actual evidence, I will be found guilty as charged.' He was given 28 days in which to appeal against the decision to the High Court.","Philip Barnwell, 36, had 'inappropriate relationship' with year 11 pupil .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . More than £3.5billion has been lost in benefit fraud and error, despite David Cameron’s promise of an ‘uncompromising’ crackdown. Repeated announcements about efforts to catch welfare cheats and curb bungling by officials have led to no change in the amount of money lost. In fact, since the coalition came to power in 2010 the amount of cash written off has risen by £300million. Official figures show how fraud and error has risen in cash terms, and as a proportion of the total welfare bill has remained flat at 2.1 per cent since the coalition was formed . Today the Department for Work and Pensions insisted it was ‘fixing the welfare system’ But the National Audit Office has warned that the scale of the losses – up by more than 9 per cent in a last year – are ‘unacceptable’. Of the £3.5billion lost last year, £1.2billion was the result of fraud, £1.6billion was attributed to error by benefits claimants and £800million was lost by officials paying out too much. In 2010-11, the first year of the coalition, £3.2billion was lost in fraud and error, leading Mr Cameron to promise a ‘tough and uncompromising’ strategy to deal with the problem. In August 2010 he said: ‘We will not shrug our shoulders and let them get away with it any longer. ‘We will take the necessary measures to stop fraud happening in the first place; root out and take tough action against those found committing fraud; and make sure the stolen money is paid back.’ But losses have risen every year in cash terms, and still accounts for 2.1 per cent of the total welfare budget, down slightly on the 2.2 per cent seen in 2009-10. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan smith was tasked by David Cameron with tackling fraud and error . Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary of Rachel Reeves said: 'David Cameron and Iain Duncan Smith have repeatedly promised to catch down on fraud and error in the benefits system, yet on the latest figures from government show the value of overpayments by the DWP rising, not falling, on their watch. 'Some £3.5 billion has been overpaid in benefits in the last year and millions have been written off on their flagship welfare reform, Universal Credit. Ministers talk tough on benefits, but are not acting. It's time for them to get a grip of fraud and error.' Figures released today show that in 2012-13 £1.32billion was lost through almost £500million from Pension Credit, £250million in Disability Living Allowance and £230million in Income Support. Council Tax Benefit accounted for £230million, Jobseeker's Allowance £210million, Carer's Allowance £110million, the State Pension £90million and Incapacity Benefit £80million. Welfare minister Lord Freud said: ‘We are fixing the welfare system to stop errors and ensuring investigators have the resources to catch cheats. ‘The level of fraud and error in the benefits system is lower than three years ago, and only a small minority commit fraud, but we are determined to continue the battle. This year we expect a record number of prosecutions. ‘The public play a vital role in our efforts to crack down on benefit fraud and error. We urge anyone who suspects someone of cheating the system to report this to the benefit fraud hotline.’ Last month the NAO refused to sign of the department’s accounts because of the scale of the problem. In 2012-13 a total of £1.2billion was lost in fraud overpayments, including £800million in benefits handed out by the DWP and a further £400million lost in payments made by local councils. In 2011-12 the figure was £1.1billion, still markedly up on £800million in 2007-08. Jobseeker’s Allowance, Income Support and Pension Credit were most likely to be used to con the taxpayer out of money, the NAO said, because ‘they require the claimant to supply complete and accurate information in order to establish entitlement to benefit’. The biggest scam involves claiming benefits as a single person while living with a partner, or lying about income levels and working cash in hand. NAO chief Amyas Morse ‘qualified’ the DWP accounts as a result of fraud and error which it was said remains ‘unacceptably high’. The accounts of the department and its predecessors have received similar qualified audit opinions since 1988-89.","Department for Work and Pensions condemned for rise in cash losses .

"By . Sam Webb . Jane Shea, 47, has now clocked-up 28 offences, mostly committed to fund her drug habit. She has now been sentenced to 12 months for a pair of thefts and breaching a community order . The drug addict ex-wife of former Arsenal and England captain Tony Adams has been jailed for twelve months for stealing handbags from guests at private parties she infiltrated. Jane Shea, 47, has now clocked-up 28 offences, mostly committed to fund her drug habit, which one ex-boyfriend claimed cost her £250,000 a year when they were together. She was sentenced at Blackfriars Crown Court with accomplice Vannessa Joseph, 33, a fellow resident at a shared home in Islington, north London - a far cry from her former footballer's wife lifestyle. Shea pleaded guilty to stealing a £200 handbag, containing a £300 iPod, on November 17, last year from the nearby Archway Leisure Centre, which had been reserved for a young boy’s birthday party. Both pleaded guilty to theft from the Carpenter’s Arms pub, Fitzrovia on January 25, when a guest at a private function had her handbag stolen by Shea and an iPhone was taken by Joseph. The Eastender married Adams, 45, in July 1992 at a grand country house and the couple have a son, Oliver, 22, and daughter Amber, 18. Shea has another daughter from an earlier relationship, Clare, 28. The couple’s marriage collapsed in 1997 as Shea struggled to cope with her drug addiction and Adams wrestled with his own drinking demons. Repeated admissions to drug rehabilitation clinics to beat her addictions failed and Shea’s nadir was ten years ago when she was arrested after fellow addict Teresa Tuppen, 44, was found by police dead in the back of her BMW. 'Both of you have had a long history . of suffering drug and alcohol addiction and many of the offences you . have committed were from those habits,' Judge Peter Murphy told the . pair, who have been locked-up since their joint arrest.

Vannessa Joseph, 33, stole an iPhone from the Carpenter's Arms pub, Fitzrovia, while Shea stole a handbag . 'You both have appalling records for dishonesty and this is not the first time community orders were tried and did not succeed. 'There was a depth of planning. These . were not spontaneous, and you must have known these were private parties . and infiltrated them, posing as guests, and stole when their backs were . turned. 'These were sophisticated offences and the public must be protected against offences of this kind.' Prosecutor . Mr Alistair Walker told the court a couple had hired the leisure . centre’s pool area and set up tables and chairs for guests of their . son’s birthday and it was closed to the public. Tony Adams has also wrestled with addictions. Right, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger (left) and Adams hold the FA Carling Premiership League trophy in 1998 . 'The husband saw Shea standing near a vending machine and was suspicious of her, because he did not recognise her. 'She had a dark jacket hanging over her arm and he observed his wife’s handbag in her possession.' Shea . was challenged about having the bag, but replied: 'No I don’t,' and . claimed she was waiting for her child in the changing room . 'It was all a bluff,' added Mr. Walker. 'She left, bashing past the husband and another parent and into the street and made off.' Shea was later identified as the thief on a video identity parade. While on bail she and Joseph targeted the West End pub, which had taken bookings from several private groups that evening. Overdose: Heroin addict Theresa Tuppen was found in the back of Shea's BMW in Fulham in 2004 . 'They were mingling with the guests and trying to blend in, but a member of one of the group’s found a handbag was missing and attention turned to these two defendants. 'Shea was carrying her bag, but inside was the one she had stolen and both defendants were pursued by a number of people.' She was stopped by police in Charlotte Street and Joseph was caught on a bus, where she had tried to hide the iPhone underneath a seat. Shea’s convictions include numerous thefts, plus burglary, having counterfeit currency, driving while unfit and she has breached non-custodial sentences such as drug rehabilitation requirements and community orders. Joseph has thirty-one previous convictions including robbery, burglary, theft, going equipped, possession of ‘crack’ cocaine and handling stolen goods. Shea’s lawyer Miss Margaret Anucha told the court: 'She has tried to make use of her time in custody, attending counselling for drug abuse and methadone and an alcohol detox programme. 'She has abstained from using drugs while in prison.' The offences breached a court imposed community order Shea was on and Miss Anucha added: 'She has had a long-standing problem with drugs, has a family, children and a grandchild.' Shea received six months for the leisure centre theft, plus four months for stealing at the pub, with two months added for breaching her community order. Joseph received six months, plus two months consecutive for also breaching a community order. Adams spent his entire playing career of 22 years as a defender at Arsenal and won four top flight division titles, three FA Cups, two Football League Cups, a UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, and three FA Community Shields. In total Adams appeared 66 times for England, scoring five times. There is a statue of him at Emirates stadium.","Jane Shea, 47, married former Arsenal player in glittering ceremony in 1992 .

"By . James Slack . and Ian Drury . Recruit: Private Cheryl James, 18, died from a gunshot at Deepcut barracks . The family of a young Army recruit who died from a single gunshot wound at Deepcut Barracks last night won a dramatic breakthrough in their 19-year battle for justice. The Attorney General, Dominic Grieve, gave consent for the parents of Cheryl James, 18, to seek a new inquest after secret police evidence emerged. The move is almost certain to lead to new public hearings into what happened at the notorious barracks in Surrey, where three other soldiers died in mysterious circumstances between 1995 and 2002. Privates Geoff Gray, 17, Sean Benton, 20, and James Collinson, 17, also died from gunshot wounds, sparking allegations of bullying and abuse. The families have refused to accept the theory that all four soldiers committed suicide using their own rifles and have accused the Army of a cover-up. Des and Doreen James, Cheryl's parents, said: 'It's truly an emotional day - it's been a long and painful process, with so many hurdles, but we never considered giving up. 'Cheryl had her whole life in front of her. When our young people lose their lives serving their country, not only do they deserve a full and independent investigation into their deaths, it must be their absolute right.' Cheryl was found dead from a single bullet wound to her head outside the notorious base in Surrey in November 1995. Surrey Police handed the matter over to the Army and her death was immediately treated as suicide, despite previous descriptions of her as 'bubbly' and 'happy'. Liberty, which is representing Cheryl's family, said the original inquest lasted just an hour. The civil liberties group said key witnesses weren't called, medical records went uninspected and important evidence was ignored. An 'open' verdict was recorded. Concerns about the string of tragedies at Deepcut led Surrey Police to open an investigation in 2002. Officers took hundreds of statements and instructed forensic experts but concluded there was no evidence anyone else was involved in the shootings. Attorney General Dominic Grieve gave consent for the parents of Cheryl James, 18, to seek a new inquest after secret police evidence emerged . Controversially, the police flatly refused to give Mr and Mrs James, from Llangollen, North Wales, access to the files. Last year, Liberty threatened the force with legal action - prompting the police to finally cave in and hand over 44 volumes of files, including witness statements, documents, notes and photographs . Some 70 per cent of the papers had never been seen before by Pte James' family. It was this new evidence that persuaded Mr Grieve to grant the family permission to apply for the new inquest. The request will now be formally considered by the High Court, but similar cases have ended in success. The Army's Deepcut training camp, , where three other soldiers died in mysterious circumstances between 1995 and 2002. Liberty Solicitor Emma Norton, who represents Cheryl's family, said: 'The Attorney General's decision gives Cheryl's grieving family a long-overdue chance to discover the truth. 'Until now their battle for answers has been repeatedly snubbed by a state that views the fundamental human rights of our troops as an optional extra. 'This young girl was preparing for a career in service - the least her family deserves is justice.' The campaign group is planning to make a second application for an inquest on behalf of Sean Benton, who died in 1995. Earlier this month a coroner ruled at a second inquest that a Royal Military policewoman Corporal Anne-Marie Ellement killed herself because of bullying and after an alleged rape. The 30-year-old was tormented by fellow Red Caps after she accused two soldiers of attacking her during a drunken night out in Germany. The hearing was a new inquest ordered after her family won a legal battle, also backed by Liberty. An earlier inquest, which found she committed suicide in October 2011, did not hear any evidence about the rape allegations. Last night a Ministry of Defence spokesman said: 'Our thoughts remain with the family and friends of Private Cheryl James. 'This decision is a matter for the Attorney General and the courts. If a new inquest is ordered, we will of course provide support to the coroner when needed.' A fresh inquest can be ordered if there is evidence of fraud, irregularity of proceedings, insufficiency of inquiry or new evidence.","Attorney General gives .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A watering hole called the ‘PoundPub’ which is set to sell pints of beer for just £1.50 and halves for a £1 could be the cheapest in the UK. The pub, currently Georgia Browns on Dovecot Street in Stockton-on-Tees, will be re-branded as PoundPub and a licensing variation is being sought to allow beer to be sold from 8am. The marketing concept is already causing concern among local councillors worried it will give the town centre - currently undergoing a £38m refurbishment - the wrong image. Stockton-on-Tees pub Georgia Browns could soon begin selling pints from £1.50 - and become the cheapest watering hole in the UK - after changing its name to PoundPub . Stockton borough councillor Phil Dennis, said he was also worried alcohol would be sold too cheaply - and concerned about the clientele that the pub would attract. 'I am very concerned about the price point a unit of alcohol in this proposal. 'I have initial doubts and concerns about the ability of such a venue to control the environment where effectively we are selling at a point where the quality of clientele will likely match the price of the product on offer,' he said. Councillor Phil Dennis raised concerns about the pub. He said: 'The quality of clientele will likely match the price of the product on offer' Ken Lupton, leader of the council’s Tory group, said: 'An individual pub with such a pricing policy would only be detrimental to the general improvement the council hopes to achieve with their significant investment in the High Street.' Mike Wardell, a director at Here for Your Hospitality Ltd which owns the premises, insisted that the pub would take part in responsible drinking campaigns, including challenging anyone who looked under-25 for identity. He added that anyone who was drunk would not be served. Mr Wardell also pointed out that supermarkets are able to sell their own value beers at 40p a can - something which is not monitored by councils. Mr Wardell said the PoundPub is aimed at the kind of person who would have frequented Working Men’s Clubs in a previous generation and not at the night-time market. He said: 'It is an eye-catching logo and, I suppose it’s a bit cheesy, but the phrase we’re going for is ‘get more round for your pound’. 'At a time when 12 pubs a week are closing across the country we have to think outside the box a bit.' The PoundPub is expected to open over the Easter period and will have traditional pub games such as darts and billiards.

"By . Rupert Steiner . Plenty of shoppers get a warm glow when their basket of goodies from Poundland comes to under a tenner. So imagine the feeling of saving literally  thousands – on the sale of a home. That could be a reality after Poundland tycoon Steve Smith set his sights on a new target…the estate agent. Entrepreneur: Poundland tycoon Steve Smith, pictured outside his mansion in Shropshire, has set his sites on the property market, and says Britons should be paying thousands less when selling their home . New venture: The founder of the cut-price chain has started the site which will charge customers as little as £195 to list their homes on the internet . He thinks Britons should be able to sell their homes for as little as £390 plus VAT and claims to have found a way of shaking up traditional chains by replacing commission rates with low priced fixed costs. Mr Smith has teamed up with the founder of dating website Match to develop the EstatesDirect website. Until now, individuals have been restricted from directly placing their homes on many of the property websites, being forced instead to pay high charges to agents. For £195, Mr Smith’s basic service will list homes on property websites such as Zoopla and Rightmove, bridging the gap between online and high street estate agents. It will also employ regional agents who provide local knowledge and meet with customers on a one-to-one basis. Changes: Mr Smith, pictured in the kitchen of his luxury home, wants to give sellers more control and eradicate hefty commission fees . Market: EstatesDirect will act as an intermediary fielding calls from prospective buyers and setting up viewings. However, homeowners will still have to put up for sale signs . EstatesDirect will act as an intermediary fielding calls from prospective buyers and setting up viewings. However, homeowners will have to show off their own homes and put up for sale signs. The site does offer a range of extras – such as negotiations on your behalf and glossy brochures – but these cost more. If the house sells, the vendor pays another £195. A prestige service, for a flat rate of £1495 when the property is sold, includes glossy brochures and a choice of For Sale boards. Mr Smith said: ‘For us, it’s all about giving sellers more control and removing the hefty commission fees associated with the traditional estate agency model. ‘We have ambitions to make EstatesDirect.com the UK’s largest, single branded, personal estate agency network within the next few years.’ The website is also aiming to slash the costs involved with finding tenants for properties. For a basic £45 it will search for tenants, check their credentials and produce a tenancy agreement. The idea is to bring together services offered by High Street chains and online property websites. Mr Smith said: ‘More than 95per cent of home movers now search for property online and it is predicted that within a few years, 60-70 per cent of all properties on the market will be listed by online estate agents. 'Yet, we know that homeowners and landlords still value the knowledge and service they receive from experts in the field.’ The website is also aiming to slash the costs involved with finding tenants for properties. For a basic £45 it will search for tenants for a nine month period and check their credentials, produce a tenancy agreement, give legal advice, and collect the first month’s rent and deposit. Originally launched regionally in 2012, the firm refined its business model and sold and let more than 450 properties. It is now seeking to raise funds to expand itself by taking small sums from the general public in exchange for equity. However such so called crowd funding is high risk. With estate agents charging between 1.5 and  2 per cent of the ultimate sale price, buyers could easily fork out £10,000 in fees when selling a £500,000 property, with other costs such as conveyancing fees to pay on top. A growing number of online-only estate agents now charge a fraction of that cost.For a basic upfront flat fee of £195, EstatesDirect.com will list homes on property  websites for nine months. For the premium service, which costs up to £2,490 if the house sells, they will send staff to conduct viewings  of your home. As it offers its services for a flat fee, the more expensive your home, the more you stand to save. On average, EstatesDirect.com claims to save customers £2,896 plus VAT, based on a traditional agent’s commission of 1.5 per cent.","Cahin's founder Steve Smith has developed new site, EstatesDirect .

"By . Laura Clark . Frequent use of 'text speak' - such as gr8 and m8 - is eroding school pupils' ability in written English, a leading head has said today (library image) Protecting standards of English from the influence of text message and social media slang is one of the biggest challenges facing teachers, a leading headmistress has suggested. Caroline Jordan, head of a top private girls' school in Oxford, warned a generation of children are leaving school without a proper grasp of spelling and grammar because of the impact of so-called textspeak. Youngsters are also in danger of growing up with limited vocabularies because they spend so much of their free time on sites such as Twitter and Facebook instead of reading. Mrs Jordan, of Headington School where fees are up to £30,000-a-year, said government plans to introduce a maths qualification for sixth-formers who choose not to take an A-level in the subject were poorly thought through, and suggested an English assessment would be more useful. Her remarks follow complaints from teachers that pupils increasingly use abbreviations and colloquialisms in school work and tests. Examples highlighted by English staff include 'ur' for 'your', 'm8' for 'mate' and 'I donno huu u r' for 'I don't know who you are'. In her latest blog, Mrs Jordan wrote: 'If we are going to make all students carry on with one subject at sixth form, why not English? 'Our English skills are constantly on display, often making the difference between landing a job and having a misspelled application filed in the bin. 'With the continuing reliance on technology, ""textspeak"" is eroding hard-learned skills in such basic areas as spelling and grammar.

Nicklas Bendtner looks to have played his last game for Arsenal after the club opened an internal investigation into bizarre allegations about his conduct on a night out in Copenhagen. Danish tabloid BT claims the 26-year-old centre forward threatened a taxi driver while his  team-mates were getting knocked out of the Champions League by Bayern Munich on Tuesday night.

"By . James  Nye . A photographer whose stark portrayal of a little girl's life surrounded by her poverty-stricken parents life of drug and alcohol abuse has defended her decision not to report them to authorities. Irina Popova's photo-essay entitled 'Another Family' sparked national outrage when its portrayal of two St. Petersburg's addicts seemingly oblivious to their two-year-old girl, Anfisa, was shared widely online. Parents Lilya and Pasha were captured living a raucous life of drug-fueled partying - while their daughter was allowed to wander to the ledge of an open window, play with their cigarettes and come face-to-face with her strung-out father's genitals while he slept-off his latest binge. Ragers: Pasha and a friend partying, with Anfisa in the foreground . When the photographs were exhibited in St. Petersburg they were nominated for awards, but when the images made it online they almost sparked an official police investigation and a campaign was started to get Anfisa away from Lilya and Pasha and put into an orphanage. Anger was mostly directed towards Popova, who was 21 when she took the photographs in 2008, for not intervening. She was labeled an opportunist for taking advantage of the drug-addicts and for not alerting anyone in a position of authority. 'I couldn’t imagine the reactions at all,' Popova said about the backlash against her. 'Maybe it’s weird, but my intention was to talk about the possibilities of love on the margins of society, and I hoped to bring more understanding, to build a bridge between people and to raise awareness that bringing up a child is not an easy task.' Popova claimed that the negative reaction was startling to her, because she claims that what is portrayed in the photographs was not the whole truth of Anfisa's life. Danger: Anfisa comes perilously close to the window ledge in her parents St. Petersburg apartment - what is not totally clear is a safety net that is under the ledge . Sleeping it off: Anfisa plays with cigarettes while her mother lies to the images left . She claims that the startling images are just that and do not represent the ability of Pasha and Lilya to raise their daughter. 'The truth is that life is complex and there are many situations too complicated to be judged,' she said. 'I thought it was important to make people think more about the level of truth which they usually don’t want to think about.' The project began when Popova traveled to St. Petersburg with the intention of creating a photographic essay about 'feelings'. Beginnings: Irina Popova found Lilya on the streets of St. Petersburg with Asfina in her stroller . Back to the apartment: Asfina stands in front of her parents Lilya and Pasha at their home in St. Petersburg . Parents: Lilya and Pasha pose in a picture from Irina Popova who published her photographic essay 'Another Family' to huge scorn . After a failed attempt to capture what she wanted at a nightclub, she spotted a woman urinating in the street at 2am as she pushed her child along in a stroller. The woman was Lilya and Popova asked if she could take photograph. She ended up asking Popova is she wanted to come back to her apartment to take more pictures. There Popova discovered a single room apartment that had a communal kitchen and bathroom. She moved in for two weeks and began taking pictures. Popova witnessed the drugs and the booze and among all this, Anfisa crawling around, apparently left to her own devices. On the street: Lilya and her mother meet with friends out and about in St. Petersburg . Cute: Dad, Pasha tickles the feet of his daughter Asfina in one of Irina Popova's revealing portraits . Lilya and Pasha had an argument about the money on the street. They went in different directions, but at the last moment, they both looked back . Lilya and Pasha even came to the unveiling of the pictures at the St.Petersburg gallery before they caused such a commotion online. Without access to the Internet, Popova felt she owed it to them to explain - especially after the police began asking her for their address. Pasha became angry at Popova because of the brush with the law and now refuses to speak to her. Lilya was relaxed - but six months after the controversy in 2012 she disappeared - leaving Anfisa with her father. She sought treatment for her addictions and is no longer with Pasha and works in a St. Petersburg clothe shop. Pasha now works part-time as an electrician while he looks after his daughter with his new partner and her son. Anfisa is attending school and is still called 'princess' by her father.
