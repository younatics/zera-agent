Whether Liverpool allow the Italian to go out on loan again remains to be seen, with the Anfield club set to favour a permanent sale. The Turin giants have also been linked with Lukaku, who has endured a difficult time under Jose Mourinho and could see his first-team opportunities limited by the recent arrival of Diego Costa from Atletico Madrid.

"By . John Drayton . An investigation into the decision to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar, initially scheduled for completion this month, is only likely to be finished in September, FIFA said in a statement on Monday. 'We expect to deliver our report to the adjudicatory chamber by the first week of September 2014,' said a statement issued by FIFA on behalf of its ethics committee. Former United States attorney Michael Garcia has been leading an internal probe by FIFA's ethics committee into allegations of corruption in the run-up to the vote in December 2010, which awarded the tournament to the Gulf state. Under scrutiny: FIFA investigator Michael Garcia has delayed the announcing of his report until September . No association: The Qatar 2022 World Cup committee bid denies that Mohamed Bin Hamman was associated with the bid process for hosting the World Cup . Hosts: Qatar held off competition from Australia to win the rights to host the 2022 World Cup . Garcia, who began his investigation 18 months ago, had said in June that he expected to deliver his report by the end of this month. When complete, Garcia's report will be handed to German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert, head of the ethics committee's adjudicatory chamber, and if he finds corruption, Qatar could face a challenge to its position as host either through a re-vote or other processes. Shortly before the World Cup in Brazil, The Sunday Times reported that some of the 'millions of documents' it had seen linked payments by former FIFA executive committee member Mohamed Bin Hammam to officials to win backing for Qatar's World Cup bid.

"By . John Drayton . They have waited 24 years to get their hands on the World Cup again and in little over a week of it being in their possession, Germany have damaged the iconic trophy. The 2014 tournament winners have chipped off a piece of their golden prize admist wild celebrations after their 1-0 extra-time win against Argentina in the final earlier this month. On Sunday, the German FA revealed the damage as captain Philip Lahm led the team in jubilant scenes after the Germans won football's most famous competition for the first time since 1990 in Brazil's Maracana stadium.

Party time: Kevin Grosskreutz (left) and Mesut Ozil (right) celebrate with the trophy after the World Cup Final . But the president of the country's football association, Wolfgang Niersbach, said a piece of the famous gold trophy was later 'chipped off' as the players showed it to fans back home. He told Die Welt: 'At one point, a small piece of our World Cup trophy was chipped off. But do not worry, we have specialists on the case who can fix it. 'We have investigated persistently who it was that damaged the trophy, but the investigation was concluded without a result.' The trophy, designed by Italian artist Silvio Gazzaniga, was introduced in 1974 and the 5kg original, made from 75 per cent 18 carat gold, is said to be worth around £8million. Scene of the crime: The trophy is believed to have been damaged as Germany did an open-top Berlin tour . Culprits? The head of the German FA said an investigation was launched but it was unclear who did the damage . Luckily for Germany however, the trophy they were given to parade around Berlin was a replica given to them by football's governing body, Fifa. The current trophy replaced the famous Jules Rimet trophy, which was given to Brazil after they won it for a third time at the 1970 World Cup. The previous trophy was stolen during a public exhibition at Westminster Central Hall ahead of the 1966 World Cup in England. It was then famously found by a dog named Pickles under a bush in Norwood, south London before England went on to win the tournament. Real deal: Bobby Moore (centre) got to lift the Jules Rimet trophy after it was found during the 1966 World Cup . It's not the first time that a team's celebrations have led to a trophy being damaged. In 2011, Sergio Ramos famously dropped the Copa del Rey beneath Real Madrid's team bus as they celebrated through the streets of the Spanish captial in an open top bus parade. The jubilant scenes got all too much for Ramos who, as he balanced the giant 15kg piece of silverware on his head, somehow let loose his grip and dropped the cup beneath the wheels of the bus. The Spain international later claimed the trophy was 'ok', but television pictures showed emergency services gathering up the broken pieces and returning them to the team on board. The cup was then absent from the traditional celebration spot of the Plaza de Cibeles in central Madrid.

One of the handles was left hanging off after the three security personnel posed for pictures with the trophy to show off to friends. The Champions League winners immediately sent the trophy to a London silversmith for emergency repairs following the incident at Stamford Bridge, which happened when the staff were outside their normal shift hours.

The England striker has sustained an ankle injury on the club's tour of New Zealand causing him to miss Wednesday morning's 2-1 defeat to Wellington. And manager Sam Allardyce is giving serious consideration to signing another centre forward amid concerns over his £15million man. Goalscorer: Lacina Traore celebrates scoring on his Everton debut against Swansea . More firepower: Sam Allardyce is considering a move for Traore following Andy Carroll's fitness struggles . Traore is among the names on West Ham's potential shortlist ahead of the new season. The 6ft 8in striker nearly joined the Hammers in January, but the Ivory Coast star opted to join Everton on loan instead. He scored on his debut for the Toffees against Swansea in the FA Cup on February 16, but sustained a hamstring injury six days later in the warm-up ahead of a clash with Chelsea and missed the rest of the season. Monaco are willing to let the striker, who could also be a target for Everton, leave this summer - a development West Ham are aware of. World class: Traore during a friendly ahead of the World Cup with the Ivory Coast . Star signing: He might have cost West Ham £15million but Carroll's injury problems make him unreliable . Carroll's time at Upton Park has been beset by injury problems, and his latest set-back has led to fears over his long-term fitness ahead of the new season. He made just 16 appearances for the club last season owing to a serious heel injury. West Ham insist he is not expected to miss the start of the new campaign, but Allardyce knows he can ill-afford another year without a proven centre forward to lead his attack. Carroll's injury problems, and his lack of options up front, played a key factor in the club's disappointing 2013/14 campaign - with the Hammers even playing without a recognised centre-forward for some matches. But Allardyce, who has completed deals for forwards Mauro Zarate and Enner Valencia, does not want to fall into the same trap next season and is weighing up a move for a new hitman.

"By . Alex Ward . The Nigerian president spent $1million of aid money to entice international popstars such as Beyonce and Jay-Z to perform at a music festival in the poverty-stricken country, a media source reported. A letter stamped and signed by Bayelsa State officials in 2006 revealed that President Goodluck Jonathan, then the Governor of the state, released 150million Nigerian Nairas from the state’s poverty alleviation fund for the inaugural ThisDay Music Festival in the city of Lagos in 2006, according to SaharaReporters. The document surfaced after reality TV star Kim Kardashian was reportedly paid $500,000 (£329,695) for a fleeting appearance in Lagos last week, angering Nigerian commentators. Poverty pay: One million dollars of Nigerian aid money was spent to entice international popstars such as Beyonce and Jay-Z to a music festival in the poverty-stricken country . The mother-to-be was billed to ‘co-host’ the Love Like A Movie event with African R’n’B crooner Darey Art-Alade, for which tickets cost N100,000 (£418). But according to local reports, Kim stayed at the event for 45 minutes, making a 45-second statement on the microphone. SaharaReporters reported that sources who provided the letter said there was an alleged link between producers of high profile entertainment events and government officials who control the budget at a state and federal level in Nigeria. The letter was sent from Nduka Obaigbena, the publisher of Nigerian newspaper ThisDay – the major sponsor for the festival - to the Bayelsa State government asking for money for the festival ahead of the country’s 46th independence celebration. Fleeting appearance: Kim Kardashian was reportedly paid $500,000 (£329,695) to 'co-host' an event in Nigeria last week . The authenticity of the letter has not been confirmed. It is not known whether the funds allegedly released by the government were paid to festival performers directly and if so, how much the performers received. One . source told SaharaReporters: ‘Mr Obaigbena often lines up financial . bonanzas from numerous governors, ministers and other top government . officials to finance his jamborees.’ At the bottom of the letter, a handwritten note allegedly signed by aides of then Governor Jonathan and the state’s accountant general says: ‘Release N150,000,000.00 (One hundred and fifty million naira) only to be drawn from the poverty alleviation subhead.’ The letter reads: ‘The music festival will bring the world’s top music icons to Nigeria and showcase the great news coming out of Nigeria. ‘Already several top music icons have signed on or are signing on. ‘They’ll tell the world through music that Nigeria’s time has come.’ The publisher added: ‘We invite you to partner with us as co-hosts of the festival. ‘With a total budget of $10 million, the co-host is expected to contribute a minimum of $2.5 million.’ There was also no indication that Beyonce and Jay Z were aware that their appearance was subsidised by the Nigerian state’s poverty alleviation fund, it was reported. Missy Elliott, Busta Rhymes, Snoop Dogg and Ciara were also among performers at the 2006 festival. Mr Obaigbena’s parent company Leaders & Company have produced other major events in Nigeria which have seen other American stars such as Usher, Rihanna and R Kelly perform since 2006. ThisDay Festival has also hosted former American President Bill Clinton and Lawrence Summers, the former economic adviser for the Obama office. Tickets prices have often been too expensive for the average Nigerian with some costing tens of thousands of Nigerian Naira. Tickets to the Love Like A Movie event in which Miss Kardashian appeared at last week cost N100,000 (£418). A letter stamped and signed by Bayelsa State officials revealed that the then Governor Goodluck Jonathan, now Nigerian President, released 150million Nigerian Nairas from the state's poverty alleviation fund for the inaugural ThisDay Music Festival in 2006 . Guardian blogger Jeremy Weate described how her visit was an example of the country’s economic elite ‘blowing its money on bling puffery while most of the country suffers’. He wrote: ‘Ms Kardashian appeared, said, “Hey Naija” and vamoosed. The rumour was that she’d been paid 500,000 Benjamins for the honour of mixing with the petro-class.’ A representative for Beyonce’s record label Columbia Records was unavailable for comment as was the Nigerian High Commission in London. While Nigeria is Africa’s most populous nation and largest oil producer, 47 per cent of Bayelsans live in poverty according to the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics. In the state’s capital, Yenagoa, about two out of every five residents do not have access to safe drinking water.

Essex Police want to speak to a man identified by witnesses as walking behind two women, one of whom may have been Nahid Almanea, near her home in the Essex town on Friday June 13. PhD student Ms Almanea, who was in Britain to study, was stabbed 16 times and left to die on Tuesday 17 June as she walked along a quiet footpath near the University of Essex campus. Police said the man, described as white, in his 30s, around 5ft 10ins tall and with short, dark hair, was seen to follow the women as they came out of a house in Stanley Wooster Way shortly before 9am. They said he had a local Colchester accent. Scroll down for video . Killed a week ago: Ms Almanea, captured here on CCTV on the day of her murder, was stabbed 16 times.

Meanwhile . in a new development this afternoon, officers sealed off a road less . than a mile away from from where Ms Almanea's body was discovered after a . knife was found near drains on Hawthorn Avenue. Today's new appeal comes a week after student was murdered on the Salary Brook Trail in Colchester at around 10.40am. Police are still looking to talk to a man seen on the footpath between 10.20am and 10.40am, shortly before Ms Almanea was found. He was walking from the direction of the university towards the Greenstead estate, and is described as being aged in his late teens to 30, with very black, thick hair which was quite short and a two to three inch mop style on top. He was clean shaven, of average build, tanned appearance and was not wearing glasses.  He was wearing baggy trousers, which may have been lightweight cotton, and a distinctive beige jacket.'

Chief Superintendent Steve Worron, of Essex Police said that police do not have evidence that the killings are linked . or that a serial killer is involved - although it is the second knife . murder in three months in the town, where the motive remains unclear. He told . MailOnline: ‘We remain open-minded about whether the same killer or . killers might be responsible for both the murders of Nahid Almanea and . James Attfield.  But at the moment there’s no evidence to suggest that . that is the case.' This . morning officers issued a CCTV image showing a man in a distinctive coat . walking under a lamp-post in CCTV dating back to the time of Mr . Attfield's murder. But confusion grew as this afternoon officers announced they'd ruled out the suggestion that he might . be wearing a jacket similar to the Italian-style designer jacket worn . by the man seen near Ms Almanea's murder scene.

Police were pictured combing the area yesterday near where student Nahid Almanea was stabbed to death .

Tragic homecoming: The funeral of Nahid Almanea in her native Saudi Arabia was held last month . Murder: James Attfield, 33, was stabbed to death in Colchester in March in an apparently motiveless attack but police are not linking the deaths . Back in March James Attfield was found dying after he was repeatedly stabbed as he walked through Colchester's Lower Castle Park. The killing was described as 'one of the most brutal murders' ever seen by police. A post mortem on the father-of-five's body took eight-and-a-half hours to complete due to the shocking extent of the injuries. He was stabbed 102 times on his arms, hands, back, neck and . head in what police described as a 'senseless and frenzied' attack. Mr Attfield was described as ‘vulnerable’ by his family after he suffered brain damage following a car accident four years ago. He was last seen in CCTV footage drinking at the bar of the River Lodge pub in his home town the evening before he was found dying. He left the pub at 10.09pm and, strangely, left behind almost three quarters of a pint of his beer. Police are still trying to establish what happened between leaving the River Lodge and when Mr Attfield was found injured in Castle Park, Colchester, at 5.45am the next day - March 29. No-one has yet been charged in connection with his murder. Now ruled out: This CCTV image is from March when police were investigating the James Attfield murder. Police initially thought the man pictured looked similar to a man seen near last week's murder scene but this afternoon they ruled this out following new information . Detectives . said they wanted to hear from anyone who recognised the man, who is . wanted for questioning by police in connection with the attack which . took place around 9.45pm. The man is . described as being white, in his early 20s, and around 5ft 7in to 5ft . 8in tall. He was of medium build and had a narrow face and appeared . unwell, and possibly had fair hair. Detectives yesterday appealed for a man and a woman seen cycling close to the murder scene to come forward. The pair, . both believed to be in their 20s, were spotted on Salary Brook Trail . heading towards the Greenstead estate at 10.45am on Tuesday, June 17. The man is . described as having olive skin, dark hair and is tall and slim, while . the woman has long dark hair and was wearing a 'flowing pattern tiered . shirt'. Mr Worron said the cyclists may have seen Ms Almanea before she was attacked and may have even seen her killer. More than . 100 police officers from Essex, Kent and the Metropolitan Police are . involved in the investigation into Ms Almanea's killing, as well as . profilers from the National Crime Agency. Detectives earlier said they were looking into the possibility that she was targeted because of her Muslim dress.

"By . Associated Press . Jean Léonard Teganya was arrested on the Maine/Canada border after being wanted for war crimes . A 42-year-old Rwandan citizen who is wanted for war crimes has been arrested at the border of Maine and Canada, U.S. Border Patrol says. Jean Léonard Teganya is wanted for deportation for violating human rights under the Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act related to the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s, a Canadian warrant says. An agent found Teganya in the Houlton, Maine, area near the border with Canada on Aug. 3. Teganya was sent to Houlton Station for processing on a violation of entry without inspection. The patrol says a database search revealed the warrant for Teganya, the patrol says. He was turned over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Office of Enforcement and Removal Operations. Teganya's lawyer said he wasn't aware his client was detained. The Rwandan genocide saw up to one million Rwandans killed between April and July in 1994 during the Rwandan Civil War. Teganya's arrest comes as two top leaders of Cambodia's former Khumer Rouge regime have been sentenced to life in prison for crimes against humanity during the 1970s genocide that left as many as two million people dead. The trial of Khieu Samphan, 83, the regime's head of state, and Nuon Chea, 88, right-hand man to the group's late leader, Pol Pot, began in November 2011 and ended with closing arguments in October 2013.

"By . Tamara Cohen . Ten thousand people who had their housing benefit capped have either moved into work or stopped claiming it entirely, new figures show. Officials said the latest figures on impact of the government’s welfare reforms showed they were clearly encouraging people to return to work. In more than 7,370 households where the benefit cap was applied someone has now found a job - a rate of 500 people a month since the policy was introduced. Progress? Figures show people in almost 8,000 households affected by the benefits cap have now got a job . An additional 2,320 households no longer claim housing benefit at all – potentially because they were earning enough not to need it anymore. Since a cap of £26,000 a year was imposed last April – the income of the average working family in Britain – 46,000 households have had their benefits brought under this level. The Department for Work and Pensions said the latest figures out yesterday showed the ballooning benefits bill is being brought under control. The figures also show that without the benefit cap, more than 2,000 households would have each received over £10,000 a year more than the threshold now allowed. 'Cuts are working': Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said the figures show the benefits cap and the cuts imposed are working . Iain Duncan Smith, said: ‘By capping benefits we are putting a stop to these runaway benefit claims and returning fairness to the system. ‘This Government is fixing the broken welfare system we inherited, ensuring that it always pays more to be in work, and thereby encouraging thousands of people to move off benefits and into jobs.’ The £26,000 cap works out as a maximum of £500 a week for couples with or without children or lone parents. It is less - just £350 a week - for a single adult. It applies to a household’s combined income for out-of-work benefits, housing, child benefit and carers’ allowance, but some families with disabled people are exempt from it. Labour have promised to be tough on welfare dependency but voted against the benefits cap, and to keep increases in benefits at 1pc per year. Rachel Reeves the shadow work and pensions secretary said last month that the number of people claiming housing benefit who are in work will double to nearly a million this year compared with 2009. She claims the way to bring this down is by increasing the minimum wage and making work contracts more secure. According to a poll by Ipsos Mori in April this year, nearly half of benefit claimants hit by the cap on welfare payments said they were doing more to find work than before. And despite predictions by critics that it would cause misery – it found 45pc of those affected said they had felt spurred to get a job. Many had sent off more applications or were using agencies or careers centres to help them find employment. Capping benefits is intended to save £185million over four years. But the DWP say it is also about the principle of rewarding hard work and ‘restoring fairness to the welfare system’.","Someone in more than 7,370 capped households have found a job .

No vintage: Rudy Kurniawan, a 37-year-old Indonesian man who was ordered on July 24 to forfeit $20 million for selling millions of dollars of counterfeit bottles of wine to unsuspecting buyers has been sentenced to a decade in jail . Gone off: Kurniawan was found guilty in December 2013 of one count of mail fraud for counterfeiting wine and one count of wire fraud for defrauding a financing company out of a $3 million loan . Wine fraud: Corks, foil capsules and wine labels that were found in the home of the supposed wine dealer . Rudy Kurniawan took the . wine world by storm by claiming he had access to wines many thought had . long since disappeared. Many experts gave his vintages glowing reviews. But . the Indonesian-born conman slipped up when he tried to sell fakes . purportedly from France’s Domaine Ponsot at a New York auction. When . the FBI raided Kurniawan’s California home in March 2012, they . discovered he created his fine vintages in his kitchen, attaching . photocopied labels from top producers to bottles of cheap Napa Valley . wines. Kurniawan’s . lawyer, Jerome Mooney, said his client is sorry for what he did but . that the harm to wealthy collectors such as Koch was minor. 'Nobody . was hurt by this, absolutely nobody was hurt by this. It's not that it’s less of a crime but that it’s less of an . impact.' Kurniawan, a 37-year-old Indonesian citizen of Chinese descent, lowered his head as the judge explained the sentence and described Kurniawan's quest as a 'bold, grandiose, unscrupulous but destined-to-fail con.' Assistant U.S. Attorney Stanley Okula described Kurniawan as the 'kingpin of counterfeiters,' a man who turned his Arcadia home into a laboratory where he poured wine into what appeared to be vintage bottles before attaching elegant fake labels and selling them for tens of millions of dollars. 'He did it to line his own pockets,' Okula told Berman, who concluded that Kurniawan had caused losses close to $30 million, primarily to seven victims. One of them was William Koch, a billionaire yachtsman, entrepreneur and wine investor. Mr Koch revealed he splashed out about $5 . million on rare French wines which turned out to be fake. Many of the counterfeits were produced by convicted fraudster Rudy Kurniawan who re-marked bottles of cheap wine with photocopied labels of top vintages. 'I just had to have them,' Koch, 74, said. 'Then I’d open it up and . drink it and it was dish water or moose piss.' Ripped off: Billionaire William Koch, 74, has admitted he spent $5 million on counterfeit wines . Fake labels: When the FBI arrested Mr Kurniawan, his Californian home contained explicit evidence of the scam, including thousands of photocopied wine labels and used corks . Fraud: Investigators found detailed instructions for fabricating labels as well as sealing wax and rubber stamps with vintages at Rudy Kurniawan's California home . Koch, . an avid wine collector, admitted he bought about 500 bottles at up to . $100,000 each, thinking they were from the finest French chateaus. Although he said there would be little sympathy for a wealthy person who'd been conned, Koch choked up while describing the debasement of 'the art, craftsmanship' of fine wines being faked. Koch, who lives in a waterfront mansion in Florida, is estimated to worth $4 billion from oil and other investments. 'I cannot stand to be cheated,'. 'I want someone to know they sell me a fake, . man, I’m coming after them no matter how much it costs.' Koch, whose twin brother is billionaire David Koch, has spent millions on lawyers and private detectives to expose the fakes. Koch’s team worked with the FBI, and he agreed to testify against Kurniawan at his criminal fraud trial. Lies: When police arrested Kurniawan in March last year, they found hundreds of home-made labels for vintage wine bottles . Before he was sentenced, Kurniawan twice apologized, saying 'I'm really sorry' and expressing a desire to take care of his mother, who lives in California after receiving asylum. Kurniawan, who moved to the United States at age 16, had his own request for political asylum turned down, and he was ordered deported in 2001. He continued to live in the United States after his appeal was rejected in 2003. He will be deported after he serves his sentence. His lawyer, Jerome H. Mooney, asked for leniency, saying his client got swept up in the thrill of mixing with California's wealthiest people. 'He was insecure, very insecure,' Mooney said. 'He wanted to be them. He wanted to be part of it.' Drinking games: Mr Kurniawan fooled several industry experts with his wine, despite blending vintages with cheap Napa Valley bottles . Mooney said Kurniawan used some of his family's fortune to buy $40 million of wine, eventually selling $36 million of it before he realized he could develop a business in which he created mixtures that tasted like the world's greatest wines. He said Kurniawan's victims were wealthy and aware that counterfeit wines were a frequent occurrence in the marketplace. 'Nobody died. Nobody lost their savings. Nobody lost their job,' he said. The lawyer said the 2 1/2 years Kurniawan has served in prison was enough penalty, since he had lost everything and been branded a cheat. Okula called the defense lawyer's comments 'quite shocking,' especially when he suggested that Kurniawan should get lenient treatment because he ripped off rich people rather than the poor. 'Fraud is fraud,' he said. Containers of wax that were used as evidence in the trial of wine dealer Rudy Kurniawan are on display. Kurniawan was found guilty of masterminding a lucrative scheme to sell fake vintage wine in New York and London . Ink stamps used to mark corks that were used as evidence in the trial of wine dealer Rudy Kurniawan . Upon Mr Kurniawan’s arrest in March last year, explicit evidence of the scam was found in his home. Thousands . of photocopied wine labels for top vintages, including 1950 Pétrus and . 1947 Lafleur, Lafite, and Romanée-Conti were found next to hundreds of . old and new corks, and an automatic device for inserting them. Most . notably, there were bottles of cheap Napa Valley wine labelled with . names vintage Bordeaux wines alongside bottles soaking in the kitchen . sink in preparation to be re-labelled. Detailed . instructions for fabricating labels for 1962 Domaine Ponsot Clos de la . Roche were found as well as sealing wax and rubber stamps with vintages . and chateaux names, such as 1899 and 1900 Latour. Michael Egan, a wine . expert hired by defrauded billionaire Bill Koch, told a New York court . that 19,000 counterfeit labels of 27 of the world’s best wines had been . found at Mr Kurniawan’s house. ‘There’s going to be a lot of wines to be cleaned up,’ Mr Egan told Los Angeles Times. ‘The . whole thing about these great wines is that they’re meant to be . historical artifacts. Every time you open one, it’s less of a dwindling . supply.’ Before World War . II, there are few records showing how many bottles of a particular wine . were produced, in what formats, and in what packaging, with variation in . bottles being common. Also, . the older and rarer the wine, the fewer people who have actually tasted . it - and even skilled tasters can disagree about flavor.","Rudy Kurniawan, 37, sold cheap wine as vintage to industry elite .

"A Texas mom had to cut short a day trip after security guards at the George W Bush Presidential Library told her she could only nurse her five-week-old baby in a public bathroom. Vanessa Baily had been visiting the Dallas library with her family last weekend, who were visiting Texas for the christening of her son, Desmond. When the newborn started to get hungry, Ms Baily asked for directions to a room where she could feed him, and was directed to the women's restroom. Shocked: Vanessa Baily, with her five-week-old son Desmond, had to leave the GW Bush library after being told to nurse her baby in a public restroom . 'We had exhausted all of the pumped milk . available and formula that we had brought,' Ms Bailey told Fox 4. 'I found that . guard and asked her where it would be acceptable to nurse my son, and . she directed me to the bathroom stall…that's what they said was the . policy.' Refusing to feed her baby in a public bathroom, Ms Baily and her family ended their tour early and left for home. Ms Baily said that her trip had been problematic from the start, when security noticed all the bottles of expressed milk she was carrying when she arrived at the library. Describing her baby as a 'constant . eater', Ms Baily said that she traveled prepared for the likelihood that . she would need to nurse and bottle feed Desmond a lot to keep him . content. Privacy: Mom-of-two Vanessa, pictured above with a nursing shawl she uses in public, says feeding babies in a public restroom is unhygienic and against the law . Day out: The Baily family were visiting the Dallas library, pictured at a dedication ceremony last year . Campaign: Vanessa tweeted about her experience and hopes that it will help raise awareness about nursing mothers' needs and rights . After spotting the bottles, security staff at the front desk told Ms Baily that although she would be able to bottle feed in the lobby, if she needed to nurse her son she would have to ask for access to a private room. A female security guard was pointed out to the family as being the best person to contact if needed, Ms Baily told WFAA. When Desmond needed to be nursed however, the guard directed Ms Baily to the women's restroom. 'She did say I could use the handicap stall, but any mom knows that a bathroom is not a place for young babies to be eating.' Ms Baily said. 'It's not hygienic or legally what the law requires.' She said . that although the library had apologized, other mothers have since come forward to say . they had a similar experience. Ms . Baily is hoping her experience, and the reaction to it on social media . sites, will encourage more people to realize breastfeeding is natural, . and that mothers should not be forced to feed babies in toilets. Apology: The Bush Presidential Library has contacted the Baily family and reminded staff that nursing mothers should not be directed to the bathrooms . 'It’s time to normalize it. Women who nurse are not exhibitionists,' Ms Baily, who uses a nursing shawl for privacy while feeding her son in public, said. Since the mother-of-two had to abandon her trip, the library director has contacted her to apologize. She is still waiting to hear if the $100 admission fee they paid will be refunded. A statement issued by the library said: 'This action by the security guard was inconsistent with the official policy at the George W. Bush Library and Museum which supports federal law defining a mother's rights to feed her child in any location she is allowed to be as guest.' Staff and security guards at the museum have been reminded of the breastfeeding policy there. 'The George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum supports the mother's right to breastfeed in any location they are allowed to be as guest,' a spokesman said.","Vanessa Baily was shocked at being told to feed baby in a bathroom stall .

"By . Ryan Lipman . Ever wondered what would happen to your body if you suddenly died in remote Australian bush? A video posted on YouTube unravels some of the mystery by substituting a cow carcass for a human's body and using time-lapse photography to show a range of animals ravaging the body. Taken over six weeks in Northern Rivers bush area, near Tweed Heads in northern NSW, the four-minute video titled If You Died in the Australian Bush shows the various stages of the cow's decay aided by a raft of animals feasting on it. 'If it's a cow, horse, possum, goat, if it's a human - it's all the same,' said Nick Cropp, 49, who took and posted the video. Scroll down for video . A video posted on YouTube shows a range of native and introduced animals eating a cow's body, including many dingoes . The animals feasted on the cow carcass over six weeks at both day and night . Mr Cropp lives on a 150-acre beef cattle farm owned by his family for four generations. When one of his cows died of cancer, he used the body to primarily attract dingoes to nearby buried bait because they had been killing cows and pet dogs. 'Instead of wasting it, I utilised her (the cow) to do something good,' he said. But in order to see what other animals were living in the bush, he used a time-lapse camera to see what was out there. 'It was to see what's been coming around. If you walk around the bush you see prints but you just don't see them (the animals),' he said. Foxes also enjoyed eating the what was left of the cow's flesh throughout the six weeks . Active during the night, the foxes returned on multiple occasions to consume what was left . With the cow's body left in bush scrub near a large tree on June 25, as expected, the first curious animal to inspect the remains was a dingo three days later. The video shows brief night time footage of the dog eating parts of the animal and the following night another dingo is again seen going repeatedly to and from the cow as it takes bites while feasting throughout the night. Dingo are carnivorous, often eating rabbits, rats, kangaroos and wallabies. Mr Cropp said he does not believe it was the same dingo returning to the cow over multiple nights. But as the nights progressed and more dingoes came, other animals started investigating the rotting body during both day and night. To the right of a frame, a native bush rat can be seen rummaging . By July the cow was showing visible signs of decomposition, but this was not enough to stop more animals from getting their fair share of what was left. The next to be drawn to the remains was an opportunistic fox on July 17, captured at night. But the fox was not alone as it inspected the body and then devoured the carcass. The introduced pest was joined by a bush rat on the same night, which rummaged on the rotting body. But on August 1, one of the more unusual animals to forage the cow corpse was a large goanna, which normally eats small lizards, mammals and insects. Checking out the remains over two days, the goanna even walked over what was left of the body during day light. A goanna, which can eat meat, was another of the animals to feed on the cow remains . The large lizard spent two days at cow carcass which was little more than skin and bones . With the cow severely decayed, most of what was left appeared to be black and white hide and bones by the end of July . Yet one of the biggest surprises was an echidna spotted by the camera at night. Living on the farm his whole life, Mr Cropp said it was a shock. 'Goannas, I've seen them, but and echidna, I haven't seen one around since I was a kid. It's nice to see,' he said. 'You don't get to see them any more.' 'It just stopped, sniffed the cow's leg and kept going.' A qualified wildlife ranger, Mr Cropp said it was encouraging to see native animals were still in the area despite the threat of dingoes and introduces pests such as foxes. An animal Mr Cropp did not expect to see was an echidna, which he said sniffed the cow's leg before walking off .","A video of dead cow in northern NSW bush shows animals feasting on it .

"By . Freya Noble . After a game of schoolyard football took a nasty turn last week, one teenager was left with such a severe injury he had to be rushed to hospital. The school maintain when James Webb disfigured his right arm after he snapped the two bones in his forearm, it was an unfortunate accident, but the 13-year-old's mother thinks something more sinister was at play. Photographs show James' forearm completely warped and bent as though it was made from play-doh. James Webb snapped both bones in his forearm after a game of schoolyard football turned nasty . The x-ray revealed the teenager had completely snapped both his radius and ulna, the two main bones that make up the forearms. Vikki Webb told The Northern Star her son was targeted by bullies who had set out to deliberately injure him during a game of 'grab football' last Tuesday. A group of year 7 students at Ballina High School were taking part in the game at recess, when they began swinging James around by his arm, Ms Webb said. James was then apparently pinned to the ground while another boy jumped on top of him, which is when onlookers are said to have heard the loud snap of his arm breaking. The teenager's mother said her son was a victim of a violent and unprovoked attack from bullies . While still on James' back with his arms around his neck, the boy then allegedly kicked the victim's broken arm - sending it flying in the opposite direction. Ms Webb said her son doesn't remember anything about the incident, which is where the conflicting stories arise. However after speaking to onlookers the boy's mother reached the conclusion that the attack was deliberate and unprovoked. One student told Ms Webb the attacker laughed during the incident and said the whole ordeal was 'fun'. The x-ray revealed James had snapped his forearm after another student allegedly jumped on his back and kicked his broken arm . A spokesman for the Department of Education, on behalf of Ballina High School, told the publication that the accident occurred when James was pushed over and other student fell on top of him. 'The evidence of student and staff reports does not suggest a deliberate attempt to break the victim's arm,' the spokesperson said. A formal complaint had been made to police and the investigation is ongoing, while James' alleged attacker had been suspended for four days.","James Webb snapped his forearm in a schoolyard football game last week .

"By . Freya Noble . Headmistress of Lindy Charm School for Girls Chrissy Keepence is on a mission to turn the women of Australia into real ladies . An Australian woman has made it her mission to turn the ordinary women of the nation into poised and charming ladies that would give the dazzling dames of the 1940s a run for their money. Headmistress of The Lindy Charm School For Girls Chrissy Keepence originally drew her inspiration from the iconic style of pin-up models and the rockabilly movement of the 1950s. Bright red lips, pin curls and vintage dresses are Ms Keepence's uniform, and now she holds workshops around the country sharing her wisdom and teaching young women 'poise, charm and posture.' 'I could pick any bogan off the street and whip them into a lady,' Ms Keepence told Daily Mail Australia. 'It's all about making sure you know how to 'sit, smile, and feel confident,' she said. As a swing dancer she learned tricks of the trade from those who lived through the period, picking up tips from women at the nursing homes she once performed in. 'The women there who lived through the 40s, they were the ones who taught me those things,' Ms Keepence explained. From using bicarbonate soda as a dry shampoo to applying beetroot juice to brighten lips and cheeks, the headmistress has all the age old techniques down pat. Scroll down for video . Ms Keepence insisted she can turn an bogan into a lady through one of her vintage styling workshops . But Ms Keepence insists it isn't all about appearances, it's about the whole package. 'With that package comes your poise, your charm, your posture... You can be the most beautiful girl but if you've got a bad posture or bad attitude then you just don't have it,' Ms Keepence said. The headmistress is certain that the women of decades past had their beauty routines perfected well before the introduction of modern products, and said they were experts at making do with what they had. The headmistress takes her program around the country teaching women posture, how to pin curl and the importance of red lipstick . 'I love the ingenious of our foremothers that through rationed times, and some of them were rationed their entire lives... They were really clever about it. They were stylish and glamorous through adversity.' 'I love the way they were able to create shapes and looks with so little,' Ms Keepence said. Through her workshops, which she takes all over Australia, the Lindy Charm School Headmistress there is a focus on the fun side but how a woman presents herself does weigh in heavily. 'I give them some easy little exercises to create a better posture, and I just remind them of what charm is, what poise is, and how it changes the way people see you. 'Whether you like it or not as soon as you step out your front door people are going to judge you,' Ms Keepence said. As for her wardrobe, the headmistress refuses to wear clothes 'straight off the rack', and more than 90 percent of her clothing is vintage. 'Why do we have to settle for the ill-fitting mass produced clothes of today?' Ms Keepence asked. In the workshops there is a focus on fun but also on posture, poise and most importantly how a woman presents herself . From 'organic' beginnings as 'girlie home days with lots of bubbles and froth and laughter', Ms Keepance has now visited nearly every capital city in the country. This weekend she will be taking her program to the Greazefest Festival in Melbourne, and the weekend after will hold vintage styling workshops in Darwin. In September the headmistress will be in Sydney. Now based on Queensland's Gold Coast, Ms Keepence was originally a 'territorian', from the Northern Territory of Australia, and said she would like to visit Darwin every year or two to help turn around the ladies in her hometown. Ms Keepence said she admires the thrift of our foremothers and wants to share her knowledge . Though her workshops focus heavily on the beauty aspect, Ms Keepence insisted the reason she started sharing her knowledge was for the 'camaraderie'. 'These are fantastic girlie bonding days', she said. 'We all have this inner beauty and confidence but sometimes it's been squashed by society... I help ladies find that.'","Chrissy Keepence is headmistress of The Lindy Charm School for Girls .

"By . Associated Press . The body of a two-star general killed in an Afghan 'insider attack' arrived Thursday at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to be prepared for burial at Arlington National Cemetery. A C-17 cargo plane carrying the body of Maj. Gen. Harold Greene, 55, landed under blue skies at the Dover base, home to the nation's largest military mortuary. Air Force chaplain Maj. Melvin K. Smith boarded the plane to offer a prayer. White-gloved soldiers then solemnly carried a flag-draped metal case with Greene's remains to a waiting mortuary vehicle as Army Secretary John McHugh stood solemnly and Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno gave a farewell salute. His family, including his . daughter Amelia Greene, daughter-in-law Kasandra Greene, son Army First .

Shot . dead: Major General  Harold J. Greene, of Falls Church, Virginia, is . the highest ranking member of the US armed forces to die in action since . Vietnam . Although the movement was carried out in silence, there were soft sobs that could be heard as members of the general’s immediate family watched the procession. In an unusual step for casualty transfers . at Dover, members of Greene's family were escorted onto the plane at . their request to thank members of the flight crew. Greene is the highest-ranked U.S. officer to be killed in combat since 1970 during the Vietnam War. Greene, a 34-year U.S. Army veteran, also is the highest-ranked American officer killed in combat in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. An Afghan soldier killed Greene and wounded 15 other allied troops Tuesday, including a German general and two Afghan generals. The . soldier who opened fire was subsequently killed in a shootout. There . was no indication that Greene was specifically targeted. An . Afghan military official said Wednesday that the gunman, who went by . the name Rafiqullah, hid in a bathroom with a NATO assault rifle, then . opened fire when a group of officers from international forces passed . by. The official spoke . on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the . information. A second Afghan military official corroborated his account. There has been no claim of responsibility in the shooting. Greene, a 34-year U.S. Army veteran, also is the highest-ranked American officer killed in combat in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq . Greene, who was from Schenectady, New York, assigned to the Combined Security Transition Command, was killed after his unit was attacked in Afghanistan . Six soldiers slowly carried a transfer case with his remains past Army Secretary John McHugh and Army Chief of Staff Ray Odierno and placed it in a truck that carried it to the Air Force-run mortuary on the base . The movement was carried out in the customary silence, but afterward, soft sobs could be heard as members of the general's immediate family boarded the aircraft to thank the crew for taking care of Greene on his final flight . Insider attacks in Afghanistan rose sharply in 2012, with more than 60 coalition troops — mostly Americans — killed in more than 40 attacks that threatened to shatter all trust between Afghan and allied forces. US commanders imposed a series of precautionary tactics and the number of such attacks declined sharply last year. Such attacks are sometimes claimed by the Taliban insurgency as proof of their infiltration. Others are attributed to personal disputes or resentment by Afghans who have soured on the continued international presence in their country more than a dozen years after the fall of the Taliban's ultra-conservative Islamic regime. There has been no claim of responsibility in Tuesday's shooting that killed Greene and wounded at least 15 others, including a German general and two Afghan generals at Marshal Fahim National Defense University, west of the Afghan capital, Kabul. Greene's death was the latest in what is a persistent problem endemic to Westerners training Afghan recruits: insider attacks . Greene will be buried at Arlington National Cemetery . The attack . has raised fresh questions about the ability of NATO soldiers stationed . in Afghanistan to train local forces, and will undermine trust between . them at a crucial time.

"By . Sean Poulter . Holidaymakers need no longer worry about returning home to an empty fridge. Waitrose has established a new system that will be allow families to order their groceries on their smartphone from a sun lounger and then pick them up from refrigerated lockers at the airport. The chain says it wants to install the lockers in ten locations, including the long stay car parks at Gatwick airport terminals as well as London underground stations and other travel hubs. Options: Waitrose is trying to make it easier for shoppers to buy groceries without visiting a store . The move is part of a wider policy by all the mainstream supermarkets to make it easier to order groceries on the web and then collect them without ever having to visit a store. While retailers see helping returning holidaymakers as a positive, the real boom is expected to be among commuters collecting their shopping on their way home from work from secure lockers. A whole new network of ‘click and collect’ points to pick up items bought on the web are springing up across the country. Argos has revealed that shoppers will be able to pick up eBay parcels from 650 stores by the end of this year. At the same time London Underground and Network Rail have both recently announced plans to turn their stations into pickup points for a host of different retailers, from Sainsbury’s to New Look. The Waitrose lockers are being tested by staff at the firm’s head office in Bracknell and they will then be installed at branches and other key locations from this autumn. Shoppers who place an order using Waitrose.com will receive a text message containing a PIN number. They can then drive up to the lockers, enter the number using a touch screen integrated in to the locker unit and collect their groceries. Multiple customer orders are stored in ambient, chilled and frozen temperature-controlled lockers that can be refilled several times a day. Fly by: Passengers flying in to Gatwick Airport will be able to grab their pre-ordered groceries on the way home . Commute and go: Tube stations on London's Underground could also see lockers for groceries popping up . In line with the delivery options already available on Waitrose.com, the service is free if the purchase is over £50 and an order placed before 11.45am can be collected the next day. Waitrose’s eCommerce director, Robin Phillips, said that the company was very excited to be offering the innovative service, which if successful, would be expanded further. ‘We are committed to finding shopping solutions that make the most sense for our shoppers and are as convenient as possible, as well as being ambitious in terms of the technology used,’ he said. ‘Giving our customers as many ways as possible to buy and collect their groceries on the move is key to building on the phenomenal growth seen at Waitrose.com. ‘Collection lockers will unlock the potential to reach customers in locations where we don’t have a shop and which are very convenient, such as on the way home from work or the school run. ‘More and more people are adding an online shopping mission to their way of buying from Waitrose and we will continue to invest in making sure that we give them what they want, when they want it.’ Sales at Waitrose.com have been outperforming the UK online grocery market and were up 50 per cent compared to market growth of 15.2 per cent in the 12 weeks to May 12, according to figures from Kantar Worldpanel.","Waitrose wants to install lockers in ten locations including Gatwick .

"By . Associated Press . Twitter's users have rocketed by 24 per cent to 271 million, the firm announced today as it revealed better than expected financial results. Although still dwarfed by rival Facebook's 1.3 billion users, the online messaging service's stock soared almost 30 percent after hours. The San Francisco-based company's stock jumped 29.6 percent to $50.01 in extended trading after the results came out. Twitter reported a 124 percent jump in quarterly revenue to $312 million, beating Wall Street's expectation for $283.1 million. At its peak in December, Twitter enjoyed a $46 billion market capitalization on just $665 million of revenue in 2013, making it one of the world's priciest stocks. Twitter said the World Cup showed the firm can still extend into new areas. 'Whether the crowd was reacting to a big goal, predicting the outcome of the next match, or discussing the latest injury or controversy, fans came to Twitter to discuss the games 672 million times,' it said after the final. 'While this is the highest number we’ve announced related to an event, it’s hard to compare the 32-day, 64-match World Cup to, for example, the single-game Super Bowl, the one-night Oscars, or the 16-day Olympics.' Timeline views, a measure of the engagement of its users, also exceeded expectations with a 15 percent increase. Twitter reported a 124 percent jump in quarterly revenue to $312 million, beating Wall Street's expectation for $283.1 million. Its shares rose 26 percent to $48.80 in extended trading, from a close of $38.59 on the New York Stock Exchange. 'Our strong financial and operating results for the second quarter show the continued momentum of our business,' said Dick Costolo, CEO of Twitter. 'We remain focused on driving increased user growth and engagement, and by developing new product experiences, like the one we built around the World Cup, we believe we can extend Twitter's appeal to an even broader audience.' Wall Street had been divided on whether Twitter can transform itself into a mainstream Internet platform on the same scale as Facebook. Some investors argue its reported user numbers do not fully reflect engagement, particularly with media viewers. Others say its inherently complex format deters wider adoption. Twitter said the World Cup showed the firm can still extend into new areas. At its peak in December, Twitter enjoyed a $46 billion market capitalization on just $665 million of revenue in 2013, making it one of the world's priciest stocks. User growth has stagnated since Twitter went public to much fanfare in November. Chief Executive Officer Dick Costolo has said that tweaks to Twitter's product would result in better user engagement, and has asked Wall Street for time to show improvement. Twitter posted a net loss of $144.6 million, or 24 cents per share, in the April-June period. That compares with a loss of $42.2 million, or 32 cents per share, a year earlier when Twitter was still a private company. Adjusted earnings were 2 cents per share in the latest quarter, beating analysts' expectations of a loss of 1 cent, according to FactSet. Revenue was $312.2 million, up from $139.3 million. Analysts polled by FactSet were expecting revenue of $283.3 million. Average monthly users were 271 million as of the end of June, up 24 percent from a year earlier and up 6 percent from the end of March. Mobile advertising revenue was $224 million, or 81 percent of the quarter's total ad revenue. In the first quarter, mobile ad revenue amounted to about 80 percent of total ad revenue.

Fragapane’s team-mates Ruby Harrold and Hannah Whelan, who she had just knocked into the minor medal positions, held her aloft and Glasgow’s SSE Hydro arena erupted into an ear splitting roar as she was announced the winner. Fragapane, whose career highlight before this week was making four finals at the English Schools Championships, thought she had blown her medal chances falling off the beam.

Pure joy: Fragapane celebrates with silver medallist Ruby Harrold and bronze medallist Hannah Whelan . England's Harrold achieved the best score on vault with a 14.800 tally to start her medal bid in the second half of the competition in the best possible way, closely followed by top all-around qualifier Fragapane, who went on to continue her good form on the bars with a score of 13.700. Whelan, having performed a good vault, stumbled on landing from bars to lose ground on her two team-mates, with Harrold scoring 14.566 to hold top spot at the halfway stage, with Fragapane second, Canada's Elsabeth Black in bronze and Wales' Elizabeth Beddoe in fourth place. Balancing act: Career highlight before this week was making four finals at the English Schools Championships . Fragapane came off the beam to slightly dent her medal bid, scoring 12.966, but Whelan impressed and achieved 14.033, with Harrold also scoring in the 12-point zone to marginally sit ahead of Fragapane and Black ahead of the final rotation.

"By . Anthony Bond . A Banksy mural which was controversially . ripped from the wall of a north London shop has been withdrawn from sale . at an auction in Miami, it emerged this evening. Slave Labour, which shows a young boy hunched over a sewing machine making Union Jack bunting, appeared on the wall in Wood Green, north London, last May, just before the Diamond Jubilee celebrations. It disappeared from the side of the Poundland store last weekend and was due to be auctioned thousands of miles away in Miami this evening. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Not for sale: A Banksy mural which was ripped from the wall of a north London shop has been withdrawn from an auction in Miami . Fury: Locals in Wood Green were left furious that a piece of free art was to be sold for profit . Street art: This new mural, centre, appeared today in the space left after the Banksy work was taken. The rat, bottom right, is believed to be the artist's response to the work being taken . Fine Art Auctions (FAA) were expecting it to reach between 500,000 US dollars (£328,063) and 700,000 US dollars (£459,288). But Haringey Council said it had been . told the sale was halted at the last minute, with no explanation given . from the auction house. It came as a new mural showing a woman in a nun's habit appeared in the space left behind by 'Slave Labour' today. Haringey Council Leader Claire Kober this evening told of her delight that the sale of the piece was halted. She . said: 'It's a true credit to the community that their campaigning . appears to have helped to stop the sale of this artwork from going . ahead. 'We will continue to explore all options to bring back Banksy to the community where it belongs.' It is now known if the new mural which appeared today is a Banksy piece. The new mural was spotted by Andy Gordon. He told the BBC: 'We thought we were just going along to see the gap in the wall and were surprised to see something else had appeared. 'It could be that Wood Green in Haringey has got its Banksy back. It could be a happy ending,' he added. 'Why?' The artist appeared to vent his feelings on the row . Local . residents, who become attached to the work by the famous street artist, . were left furious that a piece of work given to the community for free . could be sold for profit. Outraged art fans had been bombarding the auction house with abusive calls and e-mails. Details . of the backlash emerged after a stencil of a rat holding a sign that . reads 'Why?' appeared on the Haringey wall, next to the blank spot where . 'Slave Labour' used to be. It . is thought the rat could be the reclusive graffiti artist's way of . voicing his verdict on the row over his original piece. Frederic Thut, owner of Fine Art Auctions Miami, previously insisted the sale of the artwork is legitimate, but admitted he had been inundated with angry phone calls and e-mails from the UK. 'It's been said that the artwork was stolen, and that's just not true,' Mr Thut told the Guardian. 'We take a lot of care with our consignors: who they are, what they do, and if there's any illegality we will not touch it.' The street art was stencilled onto the side of a Poundland shop in Wood Green in 2012 and protected by a perspex screen, but disappeared last week. The Metropolitan Police have confirmed they were contacted by authorities in the U.S. regarding the Banksy piece. They were advised that there had been no reports of theft, Scotland Yard said. U.S. officials had waded into the row after the disappearance prompted a storm of outrage by furious Haringey businesses and residents, the Evening Standard reported. Mr Thut claimed it is being sold by a 'well-known' collector who . is not British, but has refused to divulge any more information. He added . that the painting was being stored in Europe. Councillor Alan Strickland . says the artwork was a 'gift' to his community and had instigated a . campaign to get the artwork returned by urging people to e-mail the U.S. auction website. He said: . 'The Banksy appeared last May and created lots of excitement in the area . - people were coming from across London to see it. 'We were really proud to have a Banksy in . our neighbourhood, so residents were shocked to realise it had been . ripped out of the wall. New addition: It is thought the reclusive graffiti artist is behind the stencil of a rat that has appeared next to the blank spot where Slave Labour used to be . 'The community feels that this art was given to us, for free, and it's now been taken away to be sold for huge profit. I'm very angry about the Banksy going - we want our Banksy back!' Much of the controversial artist's work is believed to have a political message, and Slave Labour is believed to be a statement on sweatshops churning out decorations and memorabilia ahead of the Diamond Jubilee and the London 2012 Olympics. In 2008 the graffiti artist Banksy revealed that millions of pounds worth of works attributed to him were fakes. A body set up by the artist to verify his work identified 226 falsely attributed pieces in eight months in 2008. He said at the time:'Graffiti art has a hard enough life as it is  -  with council workers wanting to remove it and kids wanting to draw moustaches on it, before you add hedgefund managers wanting to chop it out and hang it over the fireplace. 'For the sake of keeping all street art where it belongs I'd encourage people not to buy anything by anybody unless it was created for sale in the first place.'","Haringey Council .

"By . James Forsyth . The morning after Ed Miliband’s conference speech, David Cameron and his speechwriting team gathered at Chequers. The Prime Minister was in bullish mood. Unlike several of his Cabinet colleagues, he wasn’t overly concerned by Miliband’s raid on ‘One Nation’ Tory territory. He joked: ‘It’s impressive to give a speech for 70 minutes without notes; it’s even more impressive to give a speech for 70 minutes without notes and not say anything.’ Cameron’s crack is typical of his new attitude. The Prime Minister has finally heeded the pleas of many of his closest allies and made himself and his Downing Street operation more political. Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps and London Mayor Boris Johnson . New Tory Chairman Grant Shapps, unlike his predecessor Baroness Warsi, attends the two key No 10 meetings of the day at 8.30am and 4pm. This ensures the party-political perspective is heard before decisions are taken. This more political approach will be evident in Cameron’s conference speech on Wednesday. He’ll argue his opponents don’t understand how to make Britain economically competitive. He’ll also try to show voters who want to get on that he understands that aspiration is the spur to success. Cameron’s party is increasingly focused on a strategy for winning a majority in 2015. The initial findings were presented to Tory Cabinet Ministers last month and to key aides at the party’s campaign headquarters last week. Outright victory has been made far harder by the Liberal Democrats’ refusal to back Tory efforts to reduce pro-Labour bias in the electoral system. But those working on the strategy – the Prime Minister’s political secretary Stephen Gilbert, his director of strategy Andrew Cooper and Shapps – believe that there are reasons for optimism. First, they think the Nineties phenomenon of ‘shy Tories’ – people not being prepared to say they are voting for the party – has returned. They calculate that the party’s true level of support could be five points or more above what headline figures suggest. Second, they are confident that incumbency gives them an advantage. Their analysis of the last Election result shows sitting MPs tended to be insulated against the national swing. Third, they think they can be more targeted. In 2010, the Tories were trying to take 160 seats. This time, they are looking at just 40. I’m told the list will include more than ten Lib Dem seats. The economy remains the key to victory in 2015, however. In his speech tomorrow, George Osborne will set out tax breaks designed to boost growth. However, on Europe little will be said. One insider ascribes this to the influence of Cabinet Secretary Jeremy Heywood. ‘You can’t talk about Europe in No 10 without Jeremy jumping down your throat,’ I’m told. Cameron will have to say more soon. For his party wants two things from him: an understanding of how he intends to win next time and a clear lead on Europe. Providing these will be the best way to unite Tories around him. Wordsmith: Speechwriter Clare Foges . David Cameron’s conference speech is the first big challenge for his new chief speechwriter, Clare Foges. Foges, who took on the job last . month following the move of  her predecessor Julian Glover  to the . Department for Transport, drafted the speech pretty  much . single-handedly. Foges, who is in her early 30s, has . risen quickly though the Tory ranks. She previously worked for MP  John . Hayes and Boris Johnson. At the start of her career, she supplemented . her salary by driving an ice-cream van. She’s been writing for Cameron . since 2008. After the Election, she followed him into No 10, where she . is respected for her ability to capture the Prime Minister’s voice, . knowing how he  would choose to say something. Boris Johnson might be going to Tory conference for only 24 hours but, to the concern of many in Downing Street, he’s still set to be the centre of attention. One No 10 aide says, only  half-jokingly: ‘At least we know where the trouble will come from.’ There’s also anger at one of Boris’s people claiming he turned down five invitations to Chequers before accepting one last weekend. Cameron is, strikingly, doing a series of TV interviews on Tuesday, both the day of the London Mayor’s speech and the Prime Minister’s birthday. I suspect the present he really wants is for Boris to behave. Ed Miliband and his team  are planning a ¿One Nation¿ trip across Britain designed to ram home the  message of his conference address . First there was the speech, then there was the tour. Ed Miliband and his team are planning a ‘One Nation’ trip across Britain designed to ram home the  message of his conference address. I understand the Labour leader is keen to show he is prepared to go to places where his party has long been absent, to show he’s serious in his intent to represent the whole country. One stop will be in a solidly Tory seat hit by rapidly rising rail fares. Miliband also wants to visit a constituency particularly affected by immigration. He knows that the last Labour Government’s failure on this issue has hurt the party badly. I’m informed that he wants to set out  a comprehensive new policy, including restrictions on low-skilled migration from within the European Union. This would pose a particular challenge to the Tories  as EU workers are not included in the Government’s immigration cap. Another part of the ‘One Nation’ message  is the fight for the union. Those close to  the Labour leader are urging him to take the battle to the Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond’s backyard and head to Aberdeenshire to make his case that Scotland should remain part of the United Kingdom. Yet Miliband needs more policy to accompany his new rhetoric. I understand there will be a Shadow Cabinet away-day later this month to thrash out proposals. He is still a long way from persuading the public that Labour would handle the nation’s finances competently. But the success of this conference has given him a political opening. Prime Minister Miliband is now a possibility that needs to be taken seriously.","David Cameron unperturbed by Ed Miliband's 'One Nation' speech .

The ASA said it was banning the ad under harm and offence rules in the advertising code, and on the grounds that it was likely to cause serious or widespread offence. Defending its use, Amazon wrote to the ASA claiming it should not have been banned because 'the card was not offensive, aggressive or lewd in its message. It was meant as a bit of light-hearted, irreverent fun', the Guardian reports. It added that the card did not target any particular group, and was not likely to cause offence to any particular race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability or age.

Nicola Mendelsohn, chairman of advertising agency Karmarama, told the Guardian she was stunned at Amazon's attitude, as it is one of the most 'vulgar, dreadful words.' In its submission to the ASA Amazon said that just because a 'small minority' find the word offensive the product should not be banned from being made available for sale the public. It also asked whether the ASA should be ruling on the card at all, as it was a product not an advert.

"By . Jane Warren . One December night in 1942 a Nazi parachutist landed in a Cambridgeshire field. His mission: to sabotage the British war effort. His name was Eddie Chapman, a British bank robber recruited by the Germans, who would shortly become MI5's Agent Zigzag. Dashing and louche, courageous and unpredictable he was to be Britain's most sensational double agent and a man hailed as a hero by both sides. Chapman has been the subject of films and TV documentaries yet little is known of his extraordinary wife Betty, a woman apparently able to cope with his affairs, criminal activities, separations and personal traumas. During their 50-year marriage Eddie had serious relationships with no fewer than six mistresses. He lived with several of them and had a daughter out of wedlock but Betty lived an independent life when they were apart and was not short of admirers. Mr and Mrs Zigzag: Eddie Chapman and Betty Farmer were married for 50 years . In her memoir Betty describes a marriage that was fraught but loving. 'She was never Eddie's victim,' says counsellor and therapist Lilian Verner-Bonds, a long-term friend of the Chapmans who contributed to the book. 'She had the same strength and steel as he did. That's why they were perfectly suited and she was able to give him the support she did.' 'There is no doubt she was his anchor and he wanted her involved in many of his ventures,' says their friend Ronald Bonewitz, who helped Betty, now 96 and living in a nursing home in the south of England, to produce her book. 'Eddie was like a torrent of water flowing around the rock that was Betty.' Excitement: Betty initially turned down Eddie's offer of marriage but then realised 'life would be more interesting with him than without him' Her first insight into his wild ways came in 1939 when Betty Farmer, as she then was, travelled to Jersey with the 25-year-old Chapman while he was on the run from Scotland Yard following crimes on the mainland (he had fled bail having been charged with blowing up the safe of the Edinburgh Co-operative Society). However she thought he was 'in films' and did not know about any of this. 'I was 22 and in love with the most handsome and charismatic man I had ever seen. I couldn't remember being happier,' she recalls of the man with whom she had been living for a little over three months. They were enjoying a lazy Sunday lunch at Jersey's Hotel de la Plage when Chapman saw an undercover policeman approaching him. He leapt from his seat, kissed Betty's shoulder and made a spectacular exit by diving through the French windows (which were closed). He was arrested later that evening. It would be six years before Betty would see Eddie again but neither ever forgot the other. 'I wasn't going to have anything like a 'normal' married life but at the same time I found my life with him was exciting' Eddie ended up serving time in Jersey. While he was incarcerated the Second World War broke out and Jersey was occupied by the Germans. Chapman volunteered his services to the Nazis as a spy, while intending all along to become a British double agent. Germany accepted his offer and named him Agent Fritzchen. They trained him in explosives, radio communications and parachuting before sending him to England in 1942 to commit acts of sabotage. He immediately surrendered offering his services to MI5 - who faked an attack on his target, the de Havilland aircraft factory in Hertfordshire, on his behalf - before making his way back to his controllers who awarded him the Iron Cross for his work as a 'saboteur'. At the same time Betty was driving an ambulance and working in a factory producing war materials. 'When it came to romance I loved and lost so often,' she says. 'I either found the ones who were unavailable but desirable or available but undesirable.' After D-Day, Chapman was sent back to Britain to report on the accuracy of Germany's V-1 weapon, which was just being launched against London. He reported to the Germans that their bombs were overshooting their central London target when in fact they were landing in the city. The Germans corrected their aim with the result that many fell short of London in Kent, doing far less damage and saving a great many people. Devoted: Betty put up with her husband having six mistresses . However Chapman's life during the war was not all derring-do. He had acquired two fiances, Freda Stevenson in England and Dagmar Lahlum in Norway. But he never forgot Betty. When the war ended in 1945 he abandoned the other women and sought her out. He later wrote: 'Uppermost in my mind was the desire to find Betty, my girl whom I had last seen when I dived through a hotel window before my arrest in Jersey.' He engaged detectives to find her but they drew a blank. 'Eddie once said it was better to live one day as a tiger than a whole life as a lamb' Lunching with them at the Berkeley . Hotel they reported their lack of success to Eddie. One of the . detectives, wondering what exactly they should be looking for, asked . him: 'Is there anyone here who resembles her?' Eddie pointed to a blonde with her . back to him at the far end of the crowded dining room. 'That girl looks . like her from the back,' Eddie said. Then she turned slightly. 'Jesus! It is Betty!' Eddie walked over and tapped her on the shoulder. Just as her last moments with Eddie . six years earlier had been punctuated with the sound of breaking glass, . her first moments of reunion were accompanied by the sound of shattering . crockery as her coffee cup smashed on the floor. Charismatic: Eddie was hailed a hero by the Nazis and the Allies during World War Two . 'I couldn't believe it. There was Eddie! 'Where did you spring from?' I asked him, having heard he was dead. And that's where it all began… again. Little did I know he would become my cross to bear for the rest of my life. 'When we were together he was all attention. But when he was on his way to meet a chum or have a drink in a local pub I could be sitting around waiting for him for the rest of the day or even a couple of days or more. Time had no meaning for Eddie.' He proposed but Betty had doubts. 'He asked me every day for months. In the end I decided that life would be more interesting with him than without him. 'I wasn't going to have anything like a 'normal' married life but at the same time I found my life with him was exciting.' They married on October 9, 1947 in London and their daughter Suzanne was born in 1954. 'He had six mistresses in his life and I used to say, when he was getting towards his end, 'You know, you had all those mistresses. How I wish there was one here now who could help me with you!' This usually elicited a laugh,' Betty recalls. When asked what it was like for her when Eddie was away so long, either with a mistress or on some nefarious errand her reply was: 'I didn't let the grass grow!' An extremely attractive woman she made a successful career in health farms, although she always fell short of the final step of commitment to someone else. The couple remained devoted to one another until his death on December 11, 1997 at the age of 83. 'The last words spoken to me by Eddie I shall remember vividly for ever. 'I love you', while sitting on his bed in his nursing home a few days before he passed on. 'Eddie once said it was better to live one day as a tiger than a whole life as a lamb,' she recalls. 'With Eddie life was lived at fever pitch, the adrenaline working overtime. You were never sure what country would be next or what scheme was coming up. I guess after such a war he never ceased to look for excitement.'","Betty Farmer was married to double agent Eddie Chapman for 50 years .

"By . Neil Sears . Police are investigating claims that Leonard Rossiter, pictured, was in a gang of sex attackers . Police are investigating claims that Leonard Rossiter was in a gang of sex attackers working on a notorious BBC drama. Operation Yewtree officers – whose inquiries were sparked by the Jimmy Savile revelations – have been told the actor, was involved in abuse on the set of the 1968 drama, The Year of the Sex Olympics. Rossiter, who starred in Rising Damp and The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin, died in 1984. Police are said to be preparing to question up to ten former BBC staff over alleged assaults on a man and a woman. The Year of the Sex Olympics told of a future dominated by reality shows and pornography. The male complainant, a 66-year-old actor, was 18 and an extra at the time of filming at London Television Centre. Rossiter played a TV producer, part of the global elite, who stranded a family on an island and delightedly kept the cameras rolling as their lives fell apart. He also co-ordinated judges giving points to couples having sex, . The drama broadcast was controversial in itself. But it is only in recent months that it has been claimed sex crimes were being committed behind the scenes during four days of filming. According to the first complainant, an actor now aged 66 who was 18 and an extra at the time of filming, he found the BBC set at London Television Centre to be a ‘cesspit of depravity’. He claimed he was assaulted twice by three men – with the second attack involving Rossiter as an excited spectator. The man said: ‘In the rehearsal room, one BBC man tightly held my wrists while two others were behind me trying to rape me. I was the victim of two assaults. ‘The second time they obviously tipped off Leonard Rossiter because while I was struggling and shouting for help he was in the room. ‘He obviously found it all a big turn-on. He was watching with glee. The staff who attacked me were animals and thought they could get away with anything.’ The former extra said that he, like the female victim, had been instructed to remove his clothes so he could be covered in gold paint for the BBC2 play. And he said he found the woman was a victim too shortly after the attacks on him, when he found her distressed at the west London studios. The man said: ‘She looked really upset and I asked her what was wrong. She said: “It’s like a f****** orgy in there - I didn’t come here to get f*****”. One of the complainants claimed the abuse occurred on the set of a drama, which was filmed at BBC Television Centre, pictured, in 1968 . ‘She had clearly witnessed something bad. She said she was going to do something about it. She did not go into details about what had happened to her. ‘She was crying and had obviously been very disturbed by what had happened. ‘I told her she wasn’t alone and that I had been attacked by Rossiter and his colleagues too.’ He said the pair then reported the attacks, continuing: ‘She was even more distressed than I was and we went to see someone senior at the Beeb to tell him what had happened. ‘I remember them saying, “If you pursue this you will never work for the BBC again.” ‘It was disgusting but we were both young and feared for our careers. The woman was too distressed to continue that day, so filming was cut short. ‘It was disgusting but we were both young and feared for our careers. The woman was too distressed to continue that day, so filming was cut short.’ The man went on: ‘It is important people know what a cesspit of depravity it was at the BBC. Staff at the Television Centre assumed they could get away with anything. It’s time these people face justice.’ A Metropolitan Police spokesman said it was not the force’s policy to give a running commentary on enquiries. And a spokesman for the BBC said: ‘Any allegations of criminality are a matter for the police, and the BBC is not able to comment.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Operation Yewtree officers have been told the actor was involved in abuse .

"By . Anna Edwards . Outraged art fans have been bombarding the U.S. auction house handling the sale of a Banksy artwork that was gouged from a wall in North London with abusive calls and e-mails. Details of the backlash emerged after a stencil of a rat holding a sign that reads 'Why?' appeared on the Haringey wall, next to the blank spot where 'Slave Labour' used to be. It is thought the rat could be the reclusive graffiti artist's way of voicing his verdict on the row over his original piece, which depicted a child labourer sewing Union Jack bunting and appeared on the wall ahead of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. New addition: It is thought the reclusive graffiti artist is behind the stencil of a rat that has appeared next to the blank spot where Slave Labour used to be . 'Why?' The artist appeared to vent his feelings on the row . It is expected to sell for around £450,000. Frederic Thut, owner of Fine Art Auctions Miami, insists the sale of the artwork is legitimate, but admitted he had been inundated with angry phone calls and e-mails from the UK. 'It's been said that the artwork was stolen, and that's just not true,' Mr Thut told the Guardian. 'We take a lot of care with our consignors: who they are, what they do, and if there's any illegality we will not touch it.' The street art was stencilled onto the side of a Poundland shop in Wood Green in 2012 and protected by a perspex screen, but disappeared last week. The Metropolitan Police have confirmed they were contacted by authorities in the U.S. regarding the Banksy piece. They were advised that there had been no reports of theft, Scotland Yard said. U.S. officials had waded into the row after the disappearance prompted a storm of outrage by furious Haringey businesses and residents, the Evening Standard reported. Mr Thut claimed it is being sold by a 'well-known' collector who . is not British, but has refused to divulge any more information. He added . that the painting was being stored in Europe. Locals . are furious about the painting being taken from the wall. Councillor Alan Strickland . says the artwork was a 'gift' to his community and has instigated a . campaign to get the artwork returned by urging people to e-mail the U.S. auction website. He said: . 'The Banksy appeared last May and created lots of excitement in the area . - people were coming from across London to see it. 'We were really proud to have a Banksy in . our neighbourhood, so residents were shocked to realise it had been . ripped out of the wall. Not for sale: A Banksy mural which was ripped from the wall of a north London shop has been withdrawn from an auction in Miami . Fury: Locals in Wood Green were left furious that a piece of free art was to be sold for profit . 'The community feels that this art was given to us, for free, and it's now been taken away to be sold for huge profit. I'm very angry about the Banksy going - we want our Banksy back!' Much of the controversial artist's work is believed to have a political message, and Slave Labour is believed to be a statement on sweatshops churning out decorations and memorabilia ahead of the Diamond Jubilee and the London 2012 Olympics. In 2008 the graffiti artist Banksy revealed that millions of pounds worth of works attributed to him were fakes. A body set up by the artist to verify his work identified 226 falsely attributed pieces in eight months in 2008. He said at the time:'Graffiti art has a hard enough life as it is  -  with council workers wanting to remove it and kids wanting to draw moustaches on it, before you add hedgefund managers wanting to chop it out and hang it over the fireplace. 'For the sake of keeping all street art where it belongs I'd encourage people not to buy anything by anybody unless it was created for sale in the first place.'","Locals furious after Banksy mural gouged from wall in North London .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Steve Nolan . Courage: Sq Ldr Wilson Charlton won the George Cross for his bravery . Medals belonging to an unsung war hero who saved countless lives by defusing 200 bombs in 60 days are expected to fetch £25,000 when they go under the hammer at auction this week. The incredible story of how Squadron Leader Wilson Charlton showed nerves of steel and 'unfailing courage' in his death-defying work, which saw him deal with an average of three live bombs a day, came to light after his George Cross and five other medals were put up for sale. The RAF bomb disposal expert was awarded the prestigious George Cross after working tirelessly day and night to make safe the UXBs that were dropped by the Luftwaffe at the height of the Battle of Britain. The sale of the medal will take place at Bosleys in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Wednesday. Sq Ldr Charlton, originally from Northumberland, was based in Wiltshire and Gloucestershire, defusing unexploded bombs falling on or near aerodromes and factories. The medal he received in recognition of his bravery is the second highest given out in the UK, and the highest gallantry award for action not in the face of an enemy. The courageous military man was later sent to the Far East to train troops in bomb disposal but was captured in Java by the Japanese in 1941. He twice attempted escape, once successfully, first by rebuilding a bomb damaged aircraft and then by constructing his own boat. Sq Ldr Charlton sadly died in 1953 aged 46, with his medal coming into the hands of a collector in Surrey. The gong is now being sold along with the heroic airman’s other war medals, including a 1939-1945 star, a Pacific star, the RAF long service award and a medal for good conduct . Steven Bosley, of Bosley’s auctioneers of Marlow, Buckinghamshire, said: 'What this chap did in such a short space of time is beyond phenomenal. 'Some of these bombs were new to the British at the time and a lot of his work would have been quite experimental and therefore even more dangerous. 'He would have worked day and night on these bombs and could easily have taken hours to defuse each one. Bravery: The George Cross is the second highest gallantry medal (library image) 'He must have been exhausted at times but had to be alert because he was obviously dealing with a life-of-death situation. 'Although he had to cover a rural area, air fields and factories in Wiltshire and Gloucestershire were targeted by the Germans. 'Speed would have been of the essence . at the aerodromes as this was September and October 1940, which was the . height of the Battle of Britain, and we needed to get our lads up in . the air again. 'Wilson Charlton probably crammed years of experience into just two months and his knowledge in defusing bombs became valuable. 'Going to the Far East at that time . with the Japanese on the advance would have been like jumping from the . frying pan and into the fire. It was no cushy number.' After being taken prisoner, Sq Ldr . Charlton led a group of men at a captured airfield in repairing an old . Dutch Air Force plane with the aim of flying to Australia. But they had to abandon the escape . attempt at the last minute as it was made clear that reprisals by the . brutal Japanese guards on the rest of the camp would be meted out in the . event of an escape. He managed to escape months later . with another group of men who made their way to the coast of Indonesia . where they started to build a boat before being captured. Sq Ldr Charlton was freed at the end of the Second World War in 1945. Hero: The reverse of Flight Lieutenant Wilson Charlton's George Cross .

On June 6, 1944, The Allies launched the biggest seaborne invasion ever seen, Operation Overlord, as they attempted to overcome the Nazi juggernaut that had conquered most of mainland Europe.

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Victims: 8.4 per cent of women at Cambridge said that attempts had been made to sexually assault them (photo posed by model) More than one in thirteen women at Cambridge University has been sexually assaulted, a shocking new survey has found. According to the study, women at the prestigious institution are routinely groped, molested and even raped - but overwhelmingly do not even report the attacks. The survey, which received over 2,000 responses, revealed that the majority of sexual assaults happen inside the university's historic colleges, where students typically live for the majority of their studies. Of the women who responded to the online survey, 8.4 per cent said that they had experienced attempts to seriously sexually assault them. However, the vast majority - 88 per cent - of victims did not report the assault, and only two students involved the police, with most contacting university staff instead. An anonymous rape victim who answered the survey said she did not report her attacker because she was so certain nothing would come of it. She said: 'I . have no reason to believe that my report will be taken seriously, . be investigated or result in a conviction. On the contrary I have every . reason to believe that he would be acquitted.' The survey was carried out online by student newspaper Varsity and the Cambridge University Student's Union (CUSU) and received 2,126 responses. Assaults: Many of the students who responded said the attacks took place in the university's historic colleges (file photo) Of the University's 12,200 undergraduates, 43 per cent are female. If the findings of the survey are applied across the university population, this would mean that 481 women have been subject to attempted sexual assault. More than half of those who answered the survey also said they had been made to feel uncomfortable by sexual comments, reflecting other studies linking sexualised 'lad culture' at the country's top universities with a high prevalence of rape. The findings from the Cambridge study are broadly in line with national research. A nationwide report in 2010 found that 7 per cent of female students had been sexually assaulted. The National Union of Students survey . also found that 16 per cent had been molested, often in public, and that . 12 per cent had been stalked. Unreported: Almost 80 per cent of students said they did not report their attacker (file photo) CUSU women’s officer Lauren Steele told Varsity: 'An incident of sexual harassment, assault, stalking or physical violence can have devastating effects on the individual, impacting on their ability to study and learn, their mental health, and their relationships. 'The University and colleges have a responsibility to provide support and care for their students.' In response to the survey, a University spokesman said: 'The University is committed to the welfare and safety of all its members, and expects all members of its community to treat each other with respect and consideration at all times, and to act within the law.' 'The level of support available to students at the University of Cambridge is unparalleled in most other universities. The health and wellbeing committee is currently examining the impact of rape and sexual assaults on students in Cambridge.'","As many as 8.4 per cent of women said they were attempted assault victims .

"By . Keith Gladdis . The battle over scallop stocks in the English Channel escalated yesterday when militant French fishermen threatened to mobilise a 250-strong armada to block British ferries. The ultimatum came as British trawlermen demanded Royal Navy protection from the French who have already fired flares and rocks at their boats. The French – who also tried to ram British boats – are furious that ‘British intruders’ have been fishing for the lucrative mollusc in Seine Bay, off the coast of Normandy. To the rescue: Members of the Royal Navy's Fisheries Protection Squadron . Conflict: A British fishing trawler (not pictured) suspected of illegally dredging scallops was ordered into a French port today and her crew threatened with prison.This picture shows French and British boats during the first clash last year . EU laws prevent British vessels in . this area from fishing within 12 miles of the French coast, but the . British boats were at least 15 miles offshore when they were attacked. Footage . of the attack has been broadcast on French television and local . newspaper Manche Libre published a headline saying ‘The Scallops War is . Declared’. Warning: French scallop trader Claude Milliner . Now the French have threatened to . launch a modern-day armada against the British, with 250 vessels set to . cause havoc by blocking cross-channel ferries. Claude Milliner, a scallop trader at . Port en Bessin, said: ‘Our government is doing nothing to protect us . from the British intruders who are pillaging our livelihood. 'We will not . hesitate to call out 250 boats or more. Our fellow trawlermen at the . other ports are with us. Our battle is their battle. ‘This situation is going to end badly. We have had enough. We will do what it takes to win the war. ‘We . have enough boats along the Channel coast to cause disruption by . blocking the ferries. We don’t want to but if we have to, we will.’ French . fishermen are demanding a ban of all fishing in the Bay of Seine in . order to replenish its cash-rich stock of fish and scallops. They . imposed a voluntary ban on fishing through the summer but when they . returned on October 1 they were angry to see how much had been harvested . by British boats. British . fishermen believe the attack earlier this week had been premeditated . because one of the 40 French vessels had a television cameraman and an . interpreter on board. Rude: . French fisherman seen offering rude hand gestures and burning England . rugby shirts during a dispute over scallop fishing areas . The ‘frightening’ attack lasted for . more than six hours and came to a halt only when a French Navy vessel . and the French coastguard intervened. The Royal Navy was deployed to protect British fishermen during the Cod Wars with Iceland in  the 1970s. In 1972, Iceland had declared an Exclusive Economic Zone beyond its own territorial waters while announcing plans to reduce over-fishing. This led to the Icelandic Coastguard cutting the nets of British trawlers that fished in the area. The UK retaliated by deploying Royal Navy warships to protect British fishing crews. There followed a number of stand-offs between UK and Icelandic vessels, which included them ramming each other. The lengthy dispute finally  ended in 1976 when Iceland threatened to close a vital Nato base in retaliation for the deployment  of the Navy. The British Government conceded that UK vessels would no longer fish within the disputed 200- nautical-mile limit. Now . British fishermen are demanding protection from the Royal Navy’s . three-strong Fisheries Protection Squadron (FPS) which patrols the UK’s . Extended Fisheries Zone. Andy . Scott, of Scott Trawlers in Dumfries, Scotland, had to call Marine . Scotland for help when one of his skippers telephoned to say his crew . were under attack. The crew of the vessel were forced to hide in the wheelhouse as rocks and iron bars were thrown. He said: ‘The skipper was very concerned for his safety and the safety of the crew. They were really helpless. ‘I could hear on the telephone the rocks and bricks raining down on the wheelhouse window. ‘The . Fisheries Protection Squadron would be a welcome sight. 'It would be . comforting to know that we had some help nearby if things escalate . again.’ The FPS is the . oldest front-line force in the Royal Navy, dating back to 1481. Its . mission is to protect the extended fisheries zone – an area covering . 80,000 square miles of sea and stretching up to 200 miles from the . coastline. The squadron comprises three River . Class Offshore Patrol Vessels – HMS Tyne, Mersey and Severn – in UK . waters. A fourth – HMS Clyde – is stationed in the Falkland Islands. Frustration: Angry French protestors have called on EU authorities to impose a temporary ban . on fishing for scallops claiming that overfishing had reduced sizes of . shellfish and catches . Anger: French trawlers confront the larger British trawler, in the centre of the picture,  during the standoff . The . 1,700-tonne vessels, each with a crew of about 45 sailors, patrol . English, Welsh and Northern Irish waters. Scotland has its own fleet. They can operate with helicopters, carry two rigid inflatable landing . craft and are armed with one 20mm gun and two general-purpose machine . guns. However the Navy says . it has  no plans to send one of its three River Class vessels to the . scene. Instead British authorities are relying on the French government . to deal with its fishermen and stop the ‘Scallops War’ from escalating. Rod . Henderson, head of coastal operations for the Marine Management . Organisation, said: ‘We are continuing high-level discussions with . French counterparts to seek assurances that these issues will not . recur.’ Tension: The French trawlers confronted the British following a dispute over fishing for scallops. This image shows a British trawler with catch of scallops . But Mr Milliner added: ‘We will do what we have to do to preserve the future of our industry. ‘For 25 years we have imposed a ban on fishing scallops during the summer up until the autumn. But the British are legally entitled to fish while we have to sit and watch. ‘What is making us even more angry is the fact that thousands of tons of the British-caught scallops are exported back to France and sold as local produce.’ French fishermen have proved true to their word when they have threatened a blockade in the Channel. In 1996, trawlermen sailed dozens of boats into the harbour mouth at the cross-channel port of Calais, roped themselves together and blocked its entrance. They delayed tens of thousands of passengers and hundreds of lorries for two days before the government gave into their demands for European Union benefits. What is crystal clear after this week’s skirmish in the Channel  is that the  British fishermen were doing nothing wrong, writes analyst David Derbyshire. They were dredging for scallops in international waters – defined as more than 12 miles from the coast – when they came under attack. The dispute is complex and its origins goes back years. The French have long accused British trawlers of over-fishing – and putting scallop stocks at risk – in and just outside their waters. For commercial reasons, they resent the fact that two thirds of the scallops caught by British boats are exported – with a large number ending up in France, undercutting their own shellfish prices. And they are frustrated by a self-imposed rule which bans French dredgers from catching scallops in the Bay of Seine off the Normandy coast between May 1 and October 1. The ban – which extends to 15 miles from the French coast – does not affect British fishermen. This year rumours of a bumper year of scallops reached UK ports in September. Within days a dozen British boats were in international waters off the Normandy coasts. By the time the French set sail on October 1, they had missed out on weeks of rich pickings. The French concede that the British are acting lawfully. But they believe it is unfair that UK boats can steam across the Channel to pick the best scallops while they can only watch. The Gallic authorities say the closed scallop season prevents over-fishing and allows the scallops to spawn in peace. But Dr Ewan Bell of the Government-funded Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aqua-culture Science, said: ‘As far as I’m aware there is no particular scientific justification for that closed season. There are peaks in their spawning but you can find spawning scallops all year round.’ Jim Portus, of the South Western Fish Producers Organisation, says the French closed season is a marketing ploy that owes more to protecting prices than protecting fish. ‘It’s an arbitrary season,’ he said. ‘We can only assume that it ensures the market is concentrated into the seven months of open season so they get a better price.’ Scallop fishing is big business in Britain.  In the UK, 50,000 tons of the shellfish worth about £54million are landed at ports each year. All but 2 per cent are caught by vessels using dredges – 3ft-wide spiked metal rakes that scrape along the seabed picking up the shellfish. It is a brutal and crude form of fishing that does untold damage to the sea floor and which is banned in the most important conservation areas. Scallops are not endangered and there are no fixed EU quotas restricting the size catches. But to prevent over-fishing, fisherman must follow complex rules covering the size of equipment, the type of dredgers, the size of scallops they can harvest and how many days they spend at sea each year. Each EU nation may dredge for scallops in its own coastal waters and in any international waters. But nations may set their own restrictions. Just as the French have a closed summer season off Normandy, British boats are banned from fishing for scallops in the Irish Sea from June to the end of October. And just as UK fishermen can ignore the French restrictions, there is nothing to stop a French boat looking for scallops in the summer off the coast of Wales. In practice, they rarely bother because  travelling so far is uneconomical. This week’s tension partly stems from the failure of talks this year over the Bay of Seine. France and Britain were close to a deal in which UK boats would stay away from the area in the summer in exchange for being given some of France’s unwanted ‘days at sea’ quota. But fishermen from Brittany objected. They were concerned the British boats would head west and start competing with them.","French ram 'British intruders' in clash over lucrative Seine Bay, off coast of Normandy .

"By . Steve Doughty . Mass immigration will damage the living standards of everyone in the country as minor economic benefits are outweighed by the social pressures of a relentlessly rising population, one of Britain’s most eminent Left-wing economists declared yesterday. Professor Robert Rowthorn, Emeritus Professor of Economics at Cambridge University and a longstanding adviser to Whitehall departments, said the economic advantages of immigration are ‘unlikely to be very large’. But the downside – from building on the green belt to the overcrowding of cities – means that the consequences of large-scale immigration ‘are mostly negative for the existing population of the UK and their descendants’. Scroll down for video . New arrivals: Romanian migrants congregate near exclusive Park Lane in central London . The findings are a major blow to claims that immigration has and will continue to bring major economic benefits. Over the past decade, widely-publicised studies by academics and liberal think tanks have repeatedly said that immigration will make us better off. Among those reported by the BBC have been claims by the Labour-leaning Institute for Public Policy Research that immigrants are paying a disproportionate share of the nation’s taxes, and that they bring economic benefits because they do jobs that Britons will not take. Last November the BBC reported a study by two senior academics at University College London as saying immigrants who have arrived since 2000 have made a ‘substantial’ addition to public finances. However, since Tony Blair introduced an effectively open-door immigration policy after the 1997 election the Daily Mail has been reporting on the impact of migration on population; on the social make-up of cities; on unemployment, worklessness, and declining wages for low-skilled workers; and on the pressure it has brought on housing and services. All have contributed to a growing unease about immigration among voters that has led all political parties to pay lip service to curbs on immigration and state benefits for migrants. Professor Rowthorn, a former consultant to the International Monetary Fund and the UN Trade and Development Commission, said in his report that there may be no economic gains from immigration at all. If there are, they will be outweighed by extra costs imposed by the strain on housing, land, schools, hospitals, water supplies and transport. He said in a landmark report for the Civitas think tank: ‘Unrestrained population growth would eventually have a negative impact on the standard of living through its environmental effects such as overcrowding, congestion and loss of amenity. Left-winger: The author of the report, Robert Rawthorn, is a former Marxist and an emeritus professor at the University of Cambridge . ‘Such losses would ultimately outweigh the small gain in average wages apparently resulting from mass immigration.’ Professor Rowthorn said the major economic benefit that immigration can provide is increasing the number of younger people in the population, so that there are more working-age people to support the growing numbers of the elderly who rely on pensions and need more health and social care. But he found that the difference to the ‘dependency ratio’ made by mass immigration is tiny compared to the major increases in population needed to sustain it. ‘If many of the immigrants fail to get jobs, or if they end up in low skill jobs or displace native workers, large-scale immigration will have a negative impact on GDP per capita and on government finances,’ he added. ‘The impact could be positive or negative but either way it is unlikely to be very large. The only thing that is certain is that immigration on the present scale, if it continues, will lead to much faster population growth and a much larger total GDP than would otherwise be the case, with consequent pressure on infrastructure and the environment.’ Professor Rowthorn, 74, is a former Marxist and remains a significant figure in Left-wing economic thinking. His report said that net migration from EU countries remains at around 130,000 a year. Numbers of Poles coming to Britain should fall, because of economic growth in Poland, but ‘prospects for south Europe and poorer eastern states, such as Bulgaria and Romania, are less rosy.’ Difficulties: Border police are seen moving on Romanians who had bedded down in Park Lane, central London . David Cameron’s promise to reduce net migration to tens of thousands, the levels of the 1990s, will be ‘virtually impossible to achieve’ because of EU immigration, the report found. It said that net migration remains at more than 200,000 a year, close to the highest level considered by the Office for National Statistics in its population projections, 225,000. This level means the population of the UK will go up by 20million over the next 50 years and 29million over the next 75 years, Professor Rowthorn said. The report said that immigration from outside Europe has had ‘a perceptible impact on the level of native employment’ since the beginning of the recession, and the same is probably true of immigration from Europe. ‘Unskilled workers have suffered some reduction in their wages due to competition from immigrants,’ the report said. ‘Even on optimistic assumptions, the economic and fiscal gains for existing inhabitants and their descendants from large-scale immigration are small in comparison to its impact on population growth’","Minor economic benefits of migration are 'outweighed by social pressures'

"By . Helen Pow . It's been 60 years since the world's first successful sex change operation transformed a quiet New York gent into a slender, blonde glamourpuss. George Jorgensen shocked the nation in December 1952 by returning from a trip to Denmark as a 27-year-old woman named Christine. Wrapped in a fur coat with eyelashes long, cheekbones high and full lips painted red, Christine resembled nothing of the young man she had been when she departed. Pioneer: George Jorgensen, left, shocked the nation in December 1952 by returning from a trip to Denmark as a 27-year-old woman named Christine, right . Jorgensen was one of the first patients to undergo both surgery and hormone therapy to change her gender, according to the BBC. 'Ex-GI becomes blonde beauty!' one U.S. headline declared as the news broke. Jorgensen had a happy childhood, growing up in the Bronx in a close-knit family. But as she reached adolescence, she became convinced she had been born into the wrong body - that of a man instead of a woman. 'The young Jorgensen never identified himself with homosexuality but rather as a woman who happened to be in a man's body,' Teit Ritzau, a Danish doctor and documentary maker who got to know Christine Jorgensen when he made a film about her in the 1980s, told the British broadcaster. While living as George, Christine said in her autobiography that she felt physically sick when men approached her, despite being attracted to them. Starlet: Wrapped in a fur coat with eyelashes long, cheekbones high and full lips painted red, Christine resembled nothing of the young man she had been when she departed . Embraced: Christine Jorgensen, pictured in 1953 with Milton Berle, was invited to all the most glamourous parties . But in the late 1940s, after a short career in the military, Jorgensen read about Christian Hamburger, a Danish doctor who was experimenting with sex change therapy using animals to test hormones. She booked her ticket to Copenhagen in 1950, convincing her Danish-born parents she intended to visit relatives. 'I was a bit nervous because there were too many people at that period who insisted I was crazy,' Jorgensen recalled years after the operation. 'But Dr Hamburger didn't feel there was anything particularly strange about it.' Dr Hamburger quickly diagnosed Jorgensen as transsexual and prescribed her a long course of female hormones, encouraging her to take on a female identity for the first time and to start wearing women's clothing in public. 'The first sign was an increase in size of the mammary glands and then hair began to grow where the patient had a bald patch on the temple,' he later said, according to the BBC. Trapped: As Jorgensen, pictured, reached adolescence, she became convinced she had been born into the wrong body . Previous life: George Jorgensen, pictured left and right, had a short stint in the U.S. military before undergoing the operation . 'Finally the whole body changed from a male to a female shape.' Psychologist Dr Georg Sturup assessed Christine and was quickly convinced that she knew what she was doing. To proceed, Dr Sturup successfully persuaded the Danish government to allow castration for such medical purposes. It had previously been outlawed. After taking the female hormones for more than a year, Jorgensen underwent the first of a number of operations to transform her genitals from male to female. It is unclear exactly what Dr Hamburger and his team did during the surgeries but, according to the BBC, it's likely they followed the lead set by a group of surgeons several decades earlier. The first attempt at a modern sex change is believed to have taken place as early as the 1930s in Berlin on a patient known as Lili Elbe. It, however, was unsuccessful and Elbe died of complications during one of the operations. But the medical notes the pioneering doctors made were a helpful guide. Content: While not finding love, it is believed Christine Jorgenson, centre, had a contented life . Supportive: After the procedure, Christine wrote to her parents stating: 'Nature made a mistake which I have had corrected, and now I am your daughter' 'Apparently the surgery was successful enough for Jorgensen to feel satisfied,' Teit Ritzau told the BBC of Christine's operation. 'There seemed to be no complications and no side-effects from the treatment, which is quite amazing when you think about how primitive things were at the time.' Christine touched on the results in interviews but never went into detail. 'Everyone is both sexes in varying degrees. I am more of a woman than a man... Of course I can never have children but this does not mean that I cannot have natural sexual intercourse - I am very much in the position right now of a woman who has a hysterectomy,' she said in 1958, the BBC reported. Luckily, Christine's parents were supportive of her decision. After the procedure, she wrote them a note. 'Nature made a mistake which I have had corrected, and now I am your daughter,' she said. Later, she said her mother had always known her son wasn't like the other boys. When she returned to New York, there was little hostility towards the new-found bombshell. Instead she was greeted with curiosity, fascination and respect by the media and the public. She became a Hollywood star with theatre and film contracts piling up and invitations to all the most glamorous parties being thrown at her. Christine was even crowned Woman of the Year by the Scandinavian Society in New York. Tragic: The influential woman died of cancer in 1989, aged 62 . Sexual revolution: Christine Jorgensen's sex change was the beginning of the sexual revolution . Trying to explain her sudden popularity, Jorgensen once said: 'I guess they all want to take a peek.' She made a comfortable living singing and performing around the country throughout the 1960s and 1970s but her personal life was less successful. Her first serious relationship broke down soon after their engagement. The next went as far as the register office, only for Jorgensen to be refused a marriage license when she pulled out a man's birth certificate, the BBC reported. 'I haven't found the right fella yet,' she regularly told reporters. Mr Ritzau believes that, overall, she had a contented life despite her apparent loneliness. 'There had been ups and downs and I think she had a little problem with alcohol, but in the end she was very straightforward, and she told me that the best company she had was herself,' he recalls. Jorgensen died of cancer in 1989, at the age of 62. A few years before she passed away, she travelled back to Denmark to reunite for the last time with the doctors that changed her gender and her life. With good humour, she acknowledged the significance of her operation, nearly 40 years earlier.

The programme drew an astonishing peak of 9.1million viewers, drawing more than twice as many viewers as ITV’s UEFA Champions League clash between Arsenal and Borussia Dortmund and BBC1’s Holby City, both seen by 4.1 million. The episode, which had an average of 8.4m viewers, also had more successful ratings than last Saturday night's X Factor show - proving just why it will be moving to BBC1 next year.

Quinn dismissed reports about chemistry between Hollywood and Tandoh, who was crowned star baker three times, saying: 'We were not thinking about any of that in there... There was no flirtation.' But she admitted there was some flirtation elsewhere in the Bake Off tent. 'We [the contestants] were each flirting with each other if we needed to, for more parchment paper or another spoon if they were still being washed up out the back,' she admitted. Group shot: Frances posed up with Paul and Mary and her all important reward . Now Quinn said that her next quest is to find herself the perfect man - with one specific attribute. She told The Sun: 'Whoever he may be, I hope he will have a healthy appetite. Someone who is 6ft would be good!' Frances added: 'Being on the show has not quite been blind date to baking date.' But Frances also revealed that her future partner will have to get used to some of her own unique personality traits. She told the Mirror: 'I . know I’m random and slightly eccentric.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . President Obama is descended from America's first black slave on his white mother's side, genealogists have claimed. DNA analysis and marriage and property records have suggested that Obama is the 11th great-grandchild of John Punch, the first black slave living in colonial Virginia nearly four centuries ago. While it was known that Obama's mother, Stanley Ann Dunham, had European ancestors, researchers discovered she also had at least this one African American forebear. The discovery sheds further light on the American biography of Obama, who last year released his birth certificate to prove he was born in the country and not Kenya, from where his black father hails. Discovery: Ancestry.com has found Obama is descended from America's first black slave on the side of his mother, Ann Dunham, pictured with Obama as a child. He is the slave's 11th great grandson . The team from Ancestry.com said they lacked definitive proof, but that evidence 'strongly suggests' the tie, which two independent genealogists told the New York Times was 'sound'. John Punch's story stretches back to the mid-1600s; he was working as a servant when he escaped Virginia for Maryland in 1640, the Times reported. Once there, he was captured and put on trial with two white servants who had also escaped, but he received the severest punishment and was condemned to servitude for life. The sentence, which came years before Virginia set laws condoning slavery, has led historians to regard him as America's first legally sanctioned slave. Family tree: The chart shows the line from Punch to Obama. The name changed to 'Bunch' after Punch had children with a white woman, who passed on her free status to them and changed their name . University of Maryland professor Ira Berlin said that historians . are unable to pinpoint an exact date the slave . trade began, but servants were bought and sold in the region from 1617. Without the specific date, historians deem Punch to be one of the first certain slaves, he added. Over two years, Ancestry.com used marriage and property records to trace Obama's mother's ancestors back to the time and place where Punch lived. Records . also showed he fathered children with a white woman, who passed on her . free status to them and gave them a slightly different name - Bunch. This name is in Dunham's family tree. As the Bunches married, they became prominent landowners in Virginia and were known as white, according to Ancestry.com. The . team traced two Bunch family branches - one that stayed in Virginia and . one that moved to the Carolinas. In Virginia, they were known as white, . in North Carolina they were recorded as 'mulatto'. Home: A map of early Virginia drawn between 1677 and 1793 shows where the first Bunches owned land . 'Proof': Left, a land grant for John Bunch I in 1662 shows he was at least 21, making him the right age to be father of John Punch II. Right, a 1827 transcript of 1640 John Punch court record enslaving him for life . Descendants of this mulatto family - another term for mixed race - are the president's cousins, records show. But Obama descends directly from the Virginia family, which moved to Tennessee. His great-great-great-great-grandmother was born there, and her daughter moved to Kansas, where his mother was born in 1942. 'We sort of stumbled across it,' lead researcher Anastasia Harman told the New York Times. 'We were just doing general . research into the president’s family tree, and as we started digging . back in time, we realised that the Bunch family were African-American.' Despite the discovery, investigators can't be 100 per cent sure of the connection as many records have been destroyed. But . the similarities of the surnames, DNA evidence showing today's Bunches have sub-Saharan African heritage and the fact that only a few Africans lived . in Virginia in the 1600s confirmed the connection. Descendants: Obama is pictured with his mother, her father Stanley Dunham and his half-sister Maya Soetoro in the early 1970s . Family: Obama is pictured with his step-father Lolo Soetoro, his half sister and his mother in the 1960s . Future president: Obama is pictured in the 1960s with his father, Barack Obama Sr, who was from Kenya . 'The odds, based on what does actually . survive, strongly suggest that President Barack Obama is a descendant . (he would be the 11th great-grandson) of the first enslaved African in . America,' Harman and her team wrote in their research paper. Two independent genealogists agreed that the research was 'sound' and 'safe', adding that the difference . of the 'P' and 'B' of Punch and Bunch were 'meaningless'. Bunch descendants also provided a DNA swab to help with the project, and researchers found the DNA profile was common in Cameroon. 'I consider myself Caucasian, but I find that my mixed-race roots go way back,' Mark Bunch, who lives in Othello, Washington, told the Times. While the mixed-race heritage of a woman . deemed Caucasian may seem odd, the Times added that more and more . Americans are discovering they too have ancestors from a different race. Before the slave trade: Obama's ancestor John Punch was condemned to a life of slavery in 1640 for escaping a home where he worked as a servant. The sentence made him America's first slave (file picture) 'It is becoming increasingly common now because people are discovering it,' said Elizabeth Shown Mills, a former president of the American Society of Genealogists, adding the internet has helped. 'In the past, very few records were available. Very few people made the effort to do the research.'

"By . John Greechan . One more defining moment. One more glorious performance by a Scottish athlete who surpassed expectations. One more explosion of joyous noise that shook Hampden to its ancient foundations. And one minor miracle. Lynsey Sharp, already a European Champion at the age of 24, on Friday produced an astonishing performance in almost impossible circumstances to claim silver in the women’s 800 metres. After spending three hours on a drip in hospital overnight, Sharp finished second only to World Champion Eunice Sum in a race that had another sell-out crowd roaring themselves hoarse until the final dip, when the local favourite just managed to pip 20-year-old Ugandan rising star Winnie Nanyondo. Emotional: Lynsey Sharp holds aloft a Scottish Saltire as she celebrates her silver medal in the women's 800m . Arms aloft: Sharp celebrates her silver medal at the Commonwealth Games as Jess Judd (left) crouches . Race: Sharp (centre) fought from the middle of the pack and she trailed England's Jess Judd (right) Yet the home hero admitted, beset by injuries and illness in a year from hell, admitted that she had been close to withdrawing after a horrendous night. ‘Last night I went out for dinner because I just thought it was the food in the village I wasn’t enjoying,’ she said, adding: ‘I order a lovely 20-quid steak – and I couldn’t face it. ‘I got back to the village, threw up for a few hours and (Team Scotland head coach) Stephen Maguire took me across the clinic. ‘I was there til half five this morning on a drop. All I’ve eaten today is porridge and scrambled egg. I just came out here to leave everything on the track. To have one more obstacle thrown at me was just laughable – I had one shot, two minutes to give it everything. ‘At half two last night, I couldn’t bend over to take my socks off because the cramps were so bad. I was wondering how the hell I could run. But somehow, another miracle. ‘I slept from half five until nine, then an hour before lunch. But I don’t know how I managed that. I’m just hoping I can enjoy some rubbish food now. I’ve been looking forward to it for days and weeks. ‘Two things I’ll never forget. One is being on my hands and knees being sick, with the nurse holding my hair back, Stephen Maguire holding my hair back – and four big police officers walking away at the sound of me being sick. Preparation: Sharp stretches on the start line before taking part in the women's 800m final at Hampden Park . Disbelief: Sharp puts her hands on her head as she realises her achievement at Hampden Park . ‘The other thing is being doubled over, trying to take my socks off while Steph Twell was sleeping in the room. ‘Written on my hand is: “Go out strong and commit.” The crowd were so intimidating. I don’t mean that to sound bad but yesterday I kind of XXXX myself on the line. So I needed something to take me away from the moment. I embraced it today. I knew they were here for me. ‘It doesn’t feel real. You all know what I’ve been through this year – and even this morning has been a nightmare. This just means so much to me, given the obstacles I’ve overcome.’ Based on what all of the athletes here had done this season, Sharp went into the race knowing that, depending on whether this was a lung-stretching dash or a tactical plod, her very best might – just might – get her a bronze medal. She would certainly have to be somewhere near her peak, though. Supremely smooth in her first heat, Sharp struggled woefully in Thursday’s semi-final, falling way off the pace on the back straight and needing an all-out sprint over the closing yards just to pinch fourth place – enough to see her into Friday’s final as one of the fastest losers. Now, loser is not a term that many people would associate with the girl from Edinburgh. Fighter, class act, winner – those are usually the words associated with an athlete who has overcome enormous obstacles just to be here. Injury and then infection had put qualification in doubt until almost the very last. And Sharp will admit that being almost forgotten during her lengthy absence had acted as a spur. At this year’s British Championships, she’d railed against the live track commentators who barely gave her a passing mention – and added this slight to others made by pundits paying lavish tributes to certain rivals for overcoming much less traumatic health issues than Sharp herself. Then she went out and beat everyone to claim her second UK title. There is a school of thought that says Sharp simply likes to have someone or something to kick against. That she isn’t happy without being written off, under-represented or just plain dissed. Whatever makes her run fast, right? She’d looked decidedly nervous ahead of her semi-final, bouncing on the line and seemingly struggling to maintain her regular focus – she’s not a waver to fans, a gleeful saluter of well-wisher, more a steely-eyed competitor – amid the deafening cheers prompted by her introduction. Inspiration: Sharp started the race with the words 'Get out strong', 'Commit' written on her hand . Shattered: Sharp clutches her chest and sprawls across the track after claiming Commonwealth silver . On Frday night, Sharp prowled the bend of lane six before the final with a definite intent, pausing only to stretch out those hamstrings one last time. Fine-tuning the instrument that had enable her to reach such heights. With Jess Judd and Jenny Meadows outside her, Canadian rival Melissa Bishop just one lane inside, she’d at least know exactly what kind of pace was needed right from the off. The Scot was out quick enough in a race where the world champion clearly decided that pace, pace and more pace was her best hope. This would be all about hanging on the train and then timing the final surge right – while hoping to have the legs to last. Sixth at the bell, she bided her time. Stayed more restrained than anyone in the crowd. She picked her moment to perfection, charging around the final bend and hitting the home straight flying, overtaking a despairing Nanyondo just on the line. The daughter of former sprint great Cameron Sharp added: ‘I think I’d have won it if I’d been 100 percent. If someone had said at half two this morning I’d have a silver medal I’d have said: “Yeah, whatever.” ‘Allan Wells came to see me in the village earlier this week and jhe gave me a signed picture of him and my dad. ‘They look like they’re holding hands and he put a really nice message on it, saying to stay focused and determined. ‘I put it up on my wall in the village above my bed. To have people like him here. Seb Coe said I could nick a medal, it means so much to me. These guys are legends. ‘I met my mum and sister on the lap of honour, that’s when I started crying. I was able to pick out people I’d grown up with, peoples parents, my mum’s friends, people I’ grown up with. ‘This is above everything, the year Ive been through I don’t think anything will ever top that.’ Competition: Jenny Meadows (centre), Jess Judd and Sharp (back centre) race around Hampden Park .","Sharp claimed a second Scottish silver on the track in two nights on Friday .

"By . Tracey Cox . When it comes to love and marriage, every couple is different. We only have to look at the celeb world to see various examples of the lovers who have sailed though marriage and the those with unions that are somewhat battle bruised. But what makes one couple last and another fall at the first (or fifth) hurdle and - more importantly - do you have what it takes to last the distance? Most of the reputable research points to seven, significant factors in making your relationship work. Scroll down for video . Tracey Cox says that there are seven significant signs to tell whether your love will last the distance or simply fizzle out . You feel closer after an argument . Sure you're raw, exhausted and a little fragile but you both feel closer than you did before the row. You've managed to talk it through rationally, listened to each others' viewpoints and come up with a solution that suits both of you. You don't let jealously get out of control . If there's one thing that can destroy a perfectly good relationship rapidly, it's inappropriate jealousy.If - instead of losing it and storming out or trying to get even by flirting with someone else - you confess jealous feelings and allow yourself to be ­reassured, you're on track for success. Couples tend to become less jealous of each other the longer you're together for obvious reasons.People vote with their feet, so if you're still together a few years on, you start to relax. You also get a better sense of whether someone is worthy of your trust. You don't take a dubious comment the wrong way . If your partner says something that could be misconstrued, you'll put the best possible light on it rather than think the worst. For example if your partner says:  'All I want to do is turn on some trash telly. I'm sick of everyone.' Instead of getting huffy and assuming they're included you 'everyone', you say, 'I know what it's like. Let me get you a nice big glass of wine.' Or, if your partner doesn't feel like sex, you simply think, they must be tired, not, they don't fancy me anymore. Tracey says that smart lovers keep each other hungry for more . You don't change to suit each other, you work with each other . No-one really wants to change because we all secretly think we're perfect! What feels more natural is to both be aware of each other's bottom line – what you each will and won't put up with – while allowing each other to be individuals. You're on track for a long-lasting relationship when there's a certain standard of behaviour that's expected, but you're not rigid. Neither of you compromise those standards, but you are prepared to put their needs before your own occasionally. You think first, react later . Everyone sees the world differently, through a different filter. If you truly accept each other, you'll allow for differences. If your partner's being extraordinarily critical of someone or something, you'll listen first to what they have to say, take into account any stresses and how tired they are, then throw in your two pence worth – if at all. Important issues are worth fighting over; trivial differences aren't. You know how to say goodbye . Your partner is about to head off for a two-week work conference overseas. You don't cling on, sob and feel miserable and resentful they're having time away from you. You take them to the airport, kiss and hug, then wave them off cheerily. A graceful exit is the best preparation for the next grand entrance. Smart lovers keep each other hungry for more. You both feel you're getting a fair deal from the ­relationship . Last but crucially important, ask yourself this: Who's getting the best deal from this relationship: me or my partner? Are they getting much more out of it than you or vice versa? Couples who honestly answer, 'It's fairly equal', are those who report the highest relationship satisfaction.

"By . Vanessa Allen . and Lucy Osborne . Updated: . 20:28 EST, 1 March 2012 . An MP charged with assault over a Commons bar brawl faced fresh calls to quit yesterday after he was accused of having an affair with a schoolgirl. Senior Labour officials said Eric Joyce, 51, should stand down following claims of a two-year relationship with teenager Meg Lauder, which is said to have started when she was only 17. The politician denies having an inappropriate relationship with Miss Lauder, now 19, and said he had not seen her since she worked for him during his 2010 general election campaign. Former Army major Joyce, who is separated from his wife Rosemary, was suspended by the Labour party last week after being charged with common assault. He was arrested after allegedly head-butting Conservative MP Stuart Andrew, 40, in an alcohol-fuelled confrontation in the Strangers’ Bar in the House of Commons. Working together: Eric Joyce and Meg Lauder were pictured together on the Falkirk Labour Party Facebook page . Allegations: Falkirk MP Eric Joyce, pictured with his then wife Rosemary,  is said to have had an affair with student Meg Lauder, right, when she worked on his 2010 election campaign . Miss Lauder worked in the Falkirk MP’s . office before the May 2010 election, and appeared beside Joyce in a . photograph on a campaign leaflet. The political activist and blogger has shut down several of her accounts on social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook, and has made no public comment. A source told the Daily Record newspaper that the 5ft 2in teenager was ‘absolutely in rapture’ with Joyce, who has young twin daughters. ‘He bragged about his Westminster contacts, made a big show of the fact he was an MP to her,’ they added. ‘He made a huge impression on her from the start and continued to do so.’ The relationship is said to have lasted two years. Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont said: ‘If these reports are true, this is a man who has abused his position of power and authority. I’m disgusted, regardless of any other issues. I think this makes Eric Joyce unfit to stand for the Labour Party.’ A neighbour of the Lauder family said: ‘Meg is a very nice girl. I have no words for what Eric Joyce did; what he has done is despicable.’ If he resigns, Joyce would trigger a by-election in his constituency. Labour currently holds a narrow majority in Falkirk over the Scottish National Party. Joyce, who also faced calls to stand down over the assault allegations, emphatically denied having an affair with Miss Lauder and claimed he had not seen her since the general election. ‘The story is not true and I will be taking legal advice,’ he said. Asked if the pair had a sexual relationship, he replied: ‘No.’ Constituency: The pair met when Meg Lauder worked in his Falkirk office before the 2010 General Election . Pamphlet: Meg Lauder wrote a piece for an election leaflet where she spoke of her trust in Mr Joyce . Friends of Miss Lauder said she frequently discussed her relationship with Joyce, and claimed she was now involved with a man in his late forties. Claire Templeton, who worked with the student for a year at clothing shop Matalan, said: ‘She was very open about her relationship with him.’ Disgraced: Labour MP Eric Joyce was pictured hill walking recently but has refused calls from his own party to resign . Another former colleague, Robyn Inch, . added: ‘She didn’t hold back on what she told us. We always thought she . was just joking and would laugh with her about it, so didn’t think . anything of it. But she used to go on about him [Joyce] and how nice he . was. She would say how he was really good-looking and they got on with . each other really well.’ Miss Lauder, now at Glasgow University, was described as a student in . Joyce’s 2010 election leaflet but did not leave school until later that . year. The MP sent her a Twitter message in August, asking what grades she had achieved in her exams. In Joyce’s pamphlet, she was quoted as saying: ‘I’m pleased Eric takes . the environment seriously and is deeply committed to making the UK a . leading digital economy. He already has a strong record on these issues . in Parliament and I’ll be pressing him to continue ... I trust Eric and . Labour to help us along the way.’ Joyce separated from his second wife, the headmistress of Tonbridge Grammar School in Kent, in 2008. He is due to appear before West London Magistrates Court on March 7, charged with three counts of common assault.

"By . Associated Press . FBI agents on Thursday were still removing thousands of artifacts ranging from arrowheads to shrunken heads and Ming Dynasty jade from a house in rural central Indiana. A 91-year-old man amassed the vast collection over several decades, perhaps since he began digging up arrowheads as a child. People who had toured Don Miller's Rush County home years before the FBI's arrival Wednesday described it as a homemade museum containing diverse items including fossils, Civil War memorabilia and what the owner claimed to be a chunk of concrete from the bunker in which Adolf Hitler committed suicide toward the end of World War II. History buff: Don Miller poses for pictures with some of his artifacts for a recent story in a local newspaper . A piece of history: The lockbox issued to Miller while serving in the Army during World War II . Tent city: In this aerial photo taken from WTHR Chopper 13, FBI agents work around the home of 91-year-old Donald Miller on Wednesday . 'It was just like a big chunk of cement from when they demolished it or whatever,' said Joe Runnebohm, whose plumbing business did work in one of Miller's houses several years ago. Agents of the FBI's art crime team began loading trucks with artifacts that Donald Miller acquired over the decades from sites as varied as China, Russia and New Guinea. However, the FBI was careful not to say whether they believed Miller had knowingly broken any laws. The FBI's aim is to catalog the artifacts and return them to their countries of origin. 'We're collecting and analyzing with the goal of repatriation,' FBI Special Agent Drew Northern said. The laws regarding the removal or collection of cultural artifacts are extremely complex. State, federal and international laws are involved, Patty Gerstenblith, a professor of law at DePaul University in Chicago. Much depends on whether objects are considered stolen or were imported with a license, and international treaties dating back as far as 1987 come into play. The United States has various agreements with 15 countries that prohibit importation of items that were illegally acquired, she said, and some nations such as Egypt forbid the export of any cultural objects that were dug from the ground. Phone calls to a number listed in Miller's name rang busy or out of service Thursday. It wasn't immediately clear how Miller acquired some of the items, but those who know him said he had been collecting since childhood. 'He's been digging, I'm sure, since he was old enough to dig,' said Andi Essex, whose business repaired water damage in Miller's basement a few years ago. None of the artifacts was damaged, she said. Makeshift museum: Miller often let people tour his home to see his collection . Command center: A trailer with a satellite dish (left) is one of many on the property . Miller was known as a world traveler, and those who know him said his visitors included Australian aborigines. Miller made no secret of his collection, those who know him said. He took schoolchildren on tours of his amateur museum, which even contained human remains, they said. A 150-foot underground tunnel linking two homes on Miller's property in Rush County, a rural Indiana area whose largest city has a population of about 6,000 people, was adorned with a 60-foot, four-foot-wide anaconda snakeskin, Runnebohm said. Carefully labeled glass showcases boasted hundreds of Native American arrowheads, along with human skulls — including one with an arrowhead stuck in it. Upstairs was a pipe organ that Miller played for visitors. 'He never tried to hide anything,' Runnebohm said. 'Everything he had he was real proud of, and he knew what everything was.'","Don Miller, 91, is an avid traveler and collector who collected thousands of artifacts over his life .

"By . John Hall . A rare Ming Dynasty wine cup described as the 'holy grail' of Chinese art has sold for £20million - smashing the previous world record price for porcelain. Liu Yiqian, an 'eccentric' multimillionaire art collector from Shanghai, purchased the white cup at Sotheby's Hong Kong this morning, with those gathered in the auction house breaking into a loud round of applause as the hammer fell on the sale. The 500-year-old treasure, which measures just 3.1 inches in diameter, is known as a 'chicken cup' due to its decoration of a cockerel and hen tending to their chicks, and is one of only 17 in the world. Scroll down for video . Record: The 'chicken cup' sold for £20million at Sotheby's auction house in Hong Kong. It was bought by Liu Yiqian - an art collector from Shanghai who is believed to be China's 200th richest person . 'Holy grail': The 500-year-old treasure, which measures just 3.1 inches in diameter, is known as a 'chicken cup' due to its decoration of a cockerel and hen tending to their chicks . Rare: Sotheby's said there were only 17 cups like this one known to exist, with four in private hands and the rest of them in museums . The cup was made during the reign the Ming Chenghua Emperor, who ruled from 1465 to 1487. 'There's no more legendary object in the . history of Chinese porcelain... This is really the holy grail when it comes to Chinese art,' said Nicholas Chow, Sotheby's deputy . chairman for Asia. 'Every time a chicken cup comes up on the market, it totally redefines prices in the field of Chinese art,' he added. The auction house said there were only 17 cups like this one known to exist, with four in private hands and the rest of them in museums. As the item was so widely coveted, bidding was limited to just a handful of wealthy investors - although the auction house itself was standing-room only for the momentous occasion. At the moment the cup was hammered down at HK$250millon (£19.3million), the crowd broke into a round of applause. Ancient: The cup was made during the reign the Ming Chenghua Emperor, who ruled from 1465 to 1487. As the item was so widely coveted, bidding was limited to just a handful of wealthy investors . Attention: Nicholas Chow, Sotheby's deputy chairman for Asia, said: 'There's no more legendary object in the history of Chinese porcelain... This is really the holy grail when it comes to Chinese art' The total price Liu Yiqian will have to pay for the cup is HK$281million (£21.7million), once Sotheby's commission charge has been taken into account. Despite the hefty price paid, the porcelain cup actually came in £1.5million below Sotheby's maximum price estimate of £23.1million. The previous record for Chinese porcelain was set in 2010 when a gourd-shaped Qianlong vase sold for £19.4million. The 'chicken cup' purchase is just the latest of several records set during spring sales at Sotheby's Hong Kong this year. The records indicate the region's super-rich are still spending despite fluctuating economic growth. New owner: Liu Yiqian (pictured), an 'eccentric' multimillionaire art collector from Shanghai, purchased the white cup at Sotheby's Hong Kong this morning . Wealthy: Dubbed 'the eccentric Mr Liu' by his employees for his habit of wearing T-shirts in the office, Forbes estimates estimates Liu Yiqian's fortune at £540million - making him China's 200th richest person . At Sunday's sale of modern and contemporary Asian art, Asian collectors bought nine of the top 10 most expensive lots. 'Definitely the mood in Hong Kong at this moment, in Asia, is buoyant,' Mr Chow said. He added that the 'chicken cup' is likely to go on display at the Shanghai museum Liu Yiqian opened with his wife Wang Wei in 2012. Born into an ordinary working class family in 1963, Liu Yiqian left school aged 14 to help with his mother's handbag manufacturing business. Working as a taxi driver to help pay the bills, he quickly turned the business into a success by coming up with a way to lower manufacturing costs and sell his bags cheaper than anyone else in Shanghai. Liu Yiqian became a multimillionaire during communist China's increasing shift towards capitalism in the 1980s and 90s, investing much of that money in art. Dubbed 'the eccentric Mr Liu' by his employees for his habit of wearing T-shirts in the office, Forbes estimates estimates Liu Yiqian's fortune at £540million - making him China's 200th richest person. The price of art and antiques in China has soared over the last decade as the country experienced an economic boom. Thanks to a strong sense of national pride, many of the most desired pieces are Chinese in origin, with works by artists still largely unknown internationally selling for millions. One piece, a painting by Zeng Fanzhi which re-imagines Leonardo Da Vinci's famous 'Last Supper' in an Asian setting, sold for £13million last year - a Chinese modern art record . Price: This white jade seal, which was carved in 1796 to celebrate Emperor Qianlong's abdication, sold for £3.25million at a Sotheby's auction in Hong Kong . Many of the very highest prices are commanded by ancient items such as Ming Dynasty chicken cups and vases, however. The previous record for Chinese porcelain was set in 2010 when a Qianlong vase sold for £19.4million. There has been much talk of Chinese art prices falling following the market slowdown in 2011, but as the sale of the chicken cup today proved, the richest art collectors are still making major purchases. In fact, Chinese buyers drove Christie's auction house sales up by 14 per cent last year, with the total sale price of £4.27billion a record by any company ever in the art market.","500-year-old wine cup was sold at auction in Hong Kong this morning .

"By . Steve Doughty . More than 500 local council managers were paid more than the Prime Minister last year, according to an analysis of town hall fat cat pay yesterday. Those pocketing more than David Cameron’ s £142,500 salary included council chief executives who would once have carried the title town clerk, and officials responsible for handling schools budgets, running subsidised social housing and organising rubbish bin collections. Around half of the 542 council staff earning more than £150,000 did so through their basic salary alone while the rest added it when pension payments, bonuses, expenses or redundancy pay-offs were also included. More than 30 employees are paid over £250,000 to work in town halls like this one in Essex (File photo) And 34 council employees were paid more than £250,000 in all during the financial year 2012/3, According to the latest Town Hall Rich List produced by the TaxPayers’ Alliance (TPA). It suggests that four years of strict curbs on council tax rises and tighter controls on local government spending have yet to undo the damage caused by the high pay spiral that gripped town halls under the Tony Blair and Gordon Brown administrations. Council managers grabbed repeated major pay increases, claiming they had rare and special skills, and councils raced to pay more for senior officials than their neighbours, in the hope of getting better managers. The findings, based on the accounts published by every council, show that there were 2,181 employees who topped the £100,000 mark for total remuneration during the year. The figure showed a drop of five per cent on the 2,295 recorded as over £100,000 in the previous year. But still 93 local authorities managed to post an increase in their number of £100,000 plus staff. Researchers at the TaxPayers’ Alliance said the 2,181 figure was an under-estimate, because some councils publish accounts that make it impossible to tell high-earning council staff from high-earning school head teachers. Some high-earning council managers have been left off the list to avoid any possibility of confusion with teachers. TPA chief executive Jonathan Isaby said: ‘It is good news that the number of senior council staff making more than £100,000 a year is falling, although that may only be because many authorities have finished paying eye-watering redundancy bills. ‘Sadly, too many local authorities are still increasing the number of highly paid staff on their payroll. ‘It is particularly galling in places where councils are pleading poverty and demanding more and more in council tax. Taxpayers expect their council to be filling potholes, not pay packets. Many rank-and-file staff in local councils will be equally appalled - at a time when councils across the country are freezing pay, it appears the money they’re saving is being used to line the pockets of town hall tycoons.’ The highest salary recorded for a town hall manager that was not boosted by redundancy or other special payments last year was that of Paul Martin, the chief executive of the London borough of Wandsworth, who was paid £274,224. Fat cats: Paul Martin (left), the chief executive of the London borough of Wandsworth, was paid £274,224; Norfolk’s chief executive David White was paid £205,300, but redundancy and pension payments took his earnings in 2012/13 to £400,800 . Overall, the highest UK package was paid to David Crawford, Glasgow’s director of social care, whose redundancy package met his earnings went close to half a million pounds. Mr Crawford was paid in all £486,303. Norfolk’s chief executive David White was paid £205,300, but redundancy and pension payments took his earnings in 2012/13 to £400,800. Kent county council, long notorious for the huge salaries paid to its chief executives, also paid its second-rank managers top money, the TPA analysis showed. Its director of business strategy David Cockburn; customer and communities director Amanda Honey; education director Patrick Leeson; environment and enterprise director Mike Austerberry; and families and social care director Andrew Ireland were all on basic salaries of more than £150,000. Managers in the £200,000 plus range included Joanna Killian, chief executive of Essex, on a basic of £210,000; Hampshire chief Andrew Smith on a basic £207,372; and Surrey’s David McNulty, on £210,350 basic. Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said that local councillors should to more to rein back excessive pay for officials. ‘I welcome this latest research from the TaxPayers’ Alliance,’ he said. ‘While it shows the cost of senior town hall pay is falling, there is still far more that local authorities can do to cut costs through consolidation of back offices, sharing services and greater transparency. ‘This Government has taken steps to open up the secret pay deals struck behind closed doors, and given elected councillors new powers to veto excessive pay and perks. But councillors now need to use these powers, and stand up for local taxpayers.’","Half of the fat cats earning over £150,000 did so through their basic salary .

The comical acrobatics of a colony of birds were captured by amateur photographer Johan Siggesson on a blustery day on a remote Scots island. The birds’ aerial dexterity was tested to the limit in the adverse weather conditions off Fair Isle earlier this week. The puffin comes in to land on a rock on remote Scottish island Fair Isle when there is a sudden gust of wind . With his wings frantically flapping in the air to stay above ground, Eck the puffin resembles ski-jumper Eddie 'the Eagle' Edwards . The bird's aerial dexterity was pushed to the limit on the blustery day in Fair Isle . Frantically flapping their wings whilst being blown sideways, others appeared to almost nose dive to the ground. Eventually they came to land on a grassy patch but had to keep flailing around to stop themselves being whirled away by the strong winds. Yet it was the hilarious antics of this little chap, dubbed ‘Eck the Puffin’, that really caught the photographer’s eye. Eck the puffin desperate tries to make it to the rock edge in the extremely windy conditions . Eventually, Eck lands on the ground safely, shortly after another puffin who also braved the extreme weather . Mr Siggesson, 37, from Gzira Malta, said: ‘I was on Fair Isle for six or seven days, just to see the puffins. 'It was a wonderful experience, made all the more so thanks to this one bird as he attempted to land despite the windy weather.’ Eddie ‘the Eagle’ Edwards became the first competitor to represent Britain in the Olympic ski-jumping in 1988 – coming last. But last year he won ITV’s celebrity diving competitio Splash! under the guidance of Olympic medalist Tom Daley. Even on firm ground, the puffins had trouble staying up right with Eck even resembling Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt's lightning bolt pose . The puffin's antics have likened him to Eddie 'the Eagle' Edwards, pictured, who became the first competitor to represent Britain in the Olympic ski-jump in 1988 and came last .","Puffin was coming into land on a blustery day on off the remote Fair Isle .

"By . Sarah Dean . Carlton . A columnist for The Sydney Morning Herald has quit after being ordered to apologise to readers for using offensive language towards them when they questioned his criticism of Israel's attack on Gaza. Mike Carlton came under fire for using abusive language in response to reader feedback, including calling one reader a 'Jewish bigot'. The 68-year-old journalist confirmed on Twitter that he had quit 'the once great newspaper' because it 'buckled to the bullies'. He wrote on Wednesday morning: 'Confirming I have quit the SMH, sad that a once great newspaper has buckled to the bullies. Thanks for your support...maintain the rage.' His resignation on Tuesday night was first confirmed to 2UE radio on Wednesday morning by Fairfax's Head of Business Media Sean Alymer. Mr Alymer said representatives from Fairfax Media tried to find a solution with Mr Carlton, after telling him he was suspended, he resigned on the spot. 'What got him in a lot of trouble is the way he responded to those readers. It’s not the article itself, it’s the way he treated readers,' Mr Alymer said. 'We said we'd suspend him and he's resigned on the spot. 'He was apologetic. He accepted he had gone too far. As more emails emerge we kind of figured we needed to suspend him. We need to put the readers first.' The newspaper's Editor-in-Chief Darren Goodsir issued an apology on Tuesday night for Carlton's behaviour saying it was 'completely unacceptable'. 'I have asked Mike to apologise for these actions. Mike regrets his behaviour and will be contacting affected readers to apologise,' Mr Goodsir said. 'On behalf of the Herald, I too apologise for any offence caused.' Scroll down for video . The 68-year-old journalist confirmed on Twitter that he had quit 'the once great newspaper' because it 'buckled to the bullies' 'The cartoon had its genesis in news photographs of men seated in chairs and lounges, observing the shelling of Gaza from the hills of Sderot,' Sydney Morning Herald Editor-in-Chief Darren Goodsir said on Monday . It's the second apology from the newspaper in recent days after they were forced to recognise a cartoon showing a Jewish man watching Gaza be bombed from his armchair had caused some distress for some readers. The cartoon accompanied a column written by Carlton on the Gaza conflict. In an email obtained by the Australian that was reportedly sent to a reader named Yury, Carlton accused him of being 'the one full of hate and bile'. 'The classic example of the Jewish bigot. Now f*** off,' the email read. 'Looking forward to hearing from you after you have joined the IDF and gone off to kill some kids. Reluctantly, of course. Until then, f*** off,' another email read. A further email, reportedly sent on 28 July, said: 'Truly, then, you are as thick as two planks. Deeply, deeply stupid.' After one of his followers tweeted him support saying 'family should be off limits', Carlton replied saying his critics are 'turds' Mike Carlton appeared angry as he responded to a tweet from someone who mocked him . The columnist thanked his readers and Twitter followers who have stood by him on Tuesday night . Mike Carlton's resignation was confirmed to radio station 2UE on Wednesday morning . Carlton also took to Twitter to fend off the criticism. 'The accusations of anti-Semitism are getting a bit tedious. My much-loved son-in-law is actually Jewish. Sorry for that inconvenient truth,' he tweeted on Monday. 'Now the loony Likudnik racists are infuriated I have a Jewish son-in-law. That's okay. I'll have him taken out and shot...' he posted not long after. The 68-year-old journalist, who fronted Australian breakfast radio for over 26 years, was previously sacked by The Sydney Morning Herald in 2008 for refusing to write his column during a strike by journalists at Fairfax Media. But he was given his job back a year later after a campaign by Herald readers and the appointment of a new editor. One of Carlton's colleagues at the Sydney Morning Herald, Kate McClymont, said she was 'so upset' by his resignation . The artist who drew the 'anti-semitic' cartoon that accompanied Carlton's column on July 26 also praised him on Twitter . While many will be pleased by Carlton's resignation on Tuesday, some have expressed their disappointment with the news. Sydney Morning Herald investigative journalist Kate McClymont wrote on Twitter: 'I am so upset by @MikeCarlton01 resigning from @smh. This is a grim day for our profession.' The artist who drew the 'anti-semitic' cartoon that accompanied Carlton's column said it was 'an honour to have drawn @MikeCarlton01 's column for the last three years'. The Herald was slammed earlier this week by the Attorney-General and the Jewish community for using the drawing of an old man seated in an armchair emblazoned with the Star of David, watching comfortably from a hill as bombs dropped on Gaza. The cartoon was reportedly based on the Israelis (pictured) who stood on a hill at the Israeli town of Sderot, overlooking the Gaza Strip, as they watched smoke rising following an Israeli strike on Gaza, on July 12 . Mr Goodsir said on Monday said it was a 'serious error of judgement' when they published the cartoon drawn by Glen Le Lievre on July 26. 'The Herald now appreciates that, in using the Star of David and the kippah in the cartoon, the newspaper invoked an inappropriate element of religion, rather than nationhood, and made a serious error of judgment. 'It was wrong to publish the cartoon in its original form,' Mr Goodsir wrote. His apology came after the Attorney-General George Brandis reportedly accused Fairfax Media of publishing anti-Semitic commentary on the Middle East. The Herald said the cartoon was based on real life photographs that showed men seated in chairs 'observing the shelling of Gaza from the hills of Sderot'. Carlton tweeted examples of such photographs on Monday. 'It was wrong to publish the cartoon in its original form. We apologise unreservedly for this lapse, and the anguish and distress that has been caused,' the Herald's apology continued. Carlton told Daily Mail Australia on Monday that although he does not wish to comment on the cartoon that was used to illustrate his column, he stands by every word that he wrote. 'It is not anti-Semitic to criticise Israel. Just this morning the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon,  condemned an Israeli air strike on a school as a ""moral outrage and a criminal act"". 'While I have been fiercely slandered by the Jewish community, I have received overwhelming majority support from the wider Herald readership,' he said. Sydney Morning Herald columnist Mike Carlton says he has been 'fiercely slandered by the Jewish community' over his column . The columnist received a huge reactionto his strongly-worded column on July 26 . In his strongly-worded article, which came as a reaction to the death of hundreds of Palestinians, Carlton said Israel 'is waging its own war of terror on the entire Gaza population of about 1.7 million people. Call it genocide, call it ethnic cleansing: the aim is to kill Arabs'. He said he believed that the Israeli response to attacks from Hamas 'has been out of all proportion, a monstrous distortion of the much-vaunted right of self defence'. However, the Australian Jewish News website criticised Carlton's column, calling it 'insidious'. 'This column was no longer about a country, this was about a people and a race,' the editorial said. 'How low can a columnist in a mainstream newspaper sink? How low can a mainstream newspaper sink?,' it asked. The Sydney Morning Herald's apology came on the same day as an apology was demanded from The Australian newspaper for a Palestinian cartoon by Bill Leak that they ran on 31 July. The former Anglican bishop of Canberra and current APAN president George Browning told Crikey the cartoon 'expresses not the slightest sympathy for those whose children have been killed in Gaza'. A representative for Fairfax Media said they tried to find a solution with Mr Carlton but he resigned on the spot . The illustration shows a member of Hamas rather than a normal Palestinian, The Australian's Editor-in-Chief Chris Mitchell said as he defended it. The cartoon shows a man in military gear with a gun, patting a child on the head and saying 'there! Now you go out to play and win the PR war for daddy'. The drawing is titled 'How the West was won over' and suggests Hamas are using Palestinian children to win sympathy from the West. Liam Hogan wrote on Twitter: 'Now that the SMH has apologised for LeLievre's cartoon, it's probably time the Oz took away Bill Leak's set of brown watercolours.' And Jane Cattermole asked: 'When will The Australian be apologising for the Bill Leak cartoon? Many people offended by that as well.' 'But not Bill Leak? No. Accusing a race of killing their own children is fine and dandy,' Darryl Snow said. Around 2,00 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have been killed since the latest conflict began more than four weeks ago. It's reported 66 Israelis - all but two of them soldiers - have also died.","Said he quit the 'once great newspaper' because it 'buckled to the bullies'

"By . John Stevens . David Cameron will be ‘degrading’ Parliament when he stuffs the House of Lords with yet more political party cronies this week, it has been claimed. The Prime Minister is to hand out around 20 peerages nominated by the three main parties boosting numbers in the upper chamber to their highest since most hereditary peers were removed. A string of Conservative supporters including The Apprentice star Karren Brady will become members of the House of Lords. Scroll down for video . The future Baroness Brady? West Ham's vice-chairman could soon take a seat on the red leather benches . Multi-millionaire Tory donors former Marks & Spencer boss Sir Stuart Rose and former party treasurer Michael Farmer are also expected to get seats. Last night, Mr Cameron was warned that the appointments could lead to fresh claims of ‘cash for peerages’. Paul Flynn, a member of the Political and Constitutional Reform select committee, said: ‘It is a nonsense to add to the number of unelected people in Parliament. ‘Bringing in these party political appointments degrades Parliament, it is a backwards step. ‘It is still possible to buy a seat in the House of Lords. It is an outrage, but it is fact. It is denied that it is the case, but an extraordinary number of donors end up in the Lords. It is a corrupting force in our democracy. Michael Farmer (left), a City financier who has donated more than £2.3million to the Tories since 2002; Paul Flynn (right), a member of the Political and Constitutional Reform select committee, said: ‘It is a nonsense to add to the number of unelected people in Parliament' ‘How can Britain be a champion for democracy around the world while this goes on?’ Patrick O’Flynn, a Ukip MEP, said: ‘Yet more LibLabCon establishment cronies being put into the unreformed House of Lords.’ Senior peers have already warned that the House of Lords is ‘full’ and that the Prime Minister must stop creating new members. They have argued that the House of Lords is overcrowded with members competing for seats in the chamber and the chance to speak in debates. Sir Stuart Rose left Marks & Spencer in 2010 and is currently chairman of grocery delivery firm Ocado. Here he is a fashion show with socialite Nancy Del'Olio . Mr Cameron’s latest appointments would increase the number of members who are entitled to attend and vote to 794 – the highest number since all but 92 of the hereditary peers were expelled. Miss Brady is a prominent Conservative backer and last year introduced Chancellor George Osborne on to the stage at the party's annual conference. The 44-year-old, who has appeared on BBC One’s The Apprentice alongside Labour peer Lord Sugar, had been offered at least half a dozen Tory safe seats in the run-up to next year’s election. At the age of 20 she was made a director of Sport Newspapers by porn baron David Sullivan. She later became managing director of Birmingham City before being appointed vice-chairman at West Ham United in 2010 when Sullivan and David Gold bought the club. From Albert Square to Parliament Square: Michael Cashman (left, with Labour MP Caroline Flint when he was Labour Party Conference chairman) could be taking a peerage and sitting on the Labour benches . Sir Stuart, who left M&S in 2010 and is currently chairman of grocery delivery firm Ocado, was appointed by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt earlier this year as an adviser on recruiting top leaders to the NHS and has also spoken at the party’s annual conference. Michael Farmer, a City financier who has donated more than £2.3million to the Tories since 2002, was appointed the party's co-treasurer by Mr Cameron in 2012. Nick Clegg is expected to nominate about six people to be elevated to the Lords including Chris Fox, the former Liberal Democrat chief executive. Ed Miliband is thought to have nominated former Eastenders actor Michael Cashman, who has been a member of the European Parliament for the West Midlands since 1999. A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘We won't be confirming anything in advance. Any appointments would be made in the usual way and are subject to independent vetting and scrutiny by the House of Lords Appointment Commission.’ The House of Lords Act 1999 reduced the number of working peers from 1,210 to 690, but it has been increasing in size and currently stands at 774 with a further 54 peers on leave of absence, disqualified or suspended. It is thought to be the second largest legislative house in the world and is more than twice the size of the upper houses in all other European Union and G20 countries.","Peerages take number in upper chamber to highest since removal of hereditaries .

"By . Associated Press . Hawaii residents were furiously stocking up on essentials as two hurricanes churned toward the islands Wednesday and weather officials asked the whole state to prepare for flash flooding. Julio gathered enough steam in the Pacific to be upgraded to hurricane status as it trailed Hurricane Iselle, which could hit as early as Thursday. Much of Hawaii was under either a tropical storm watch or warning. Scroll down for video . Shoppers lift cases of bottled water in preparation for a hurricane and tropical storm heading toward Hawaii at the Iwilei Costco in Honolulu on Tuesday . Hurricane Iselle weakened slightly overnight. Its eye was about 925 miles from Honolulu Wednesday morning. Hurricane Julio is expected to strengthen slowly over the next day and a half or so. Hurricane-force winds extend up to 15 miles from Julio's eye. Julio was spinning about 1,650 miles east of Hilo, with winds of about 75 mph, making it a Category 1 hurricane, said Lixion Avlia, senior hurricane forecaster with National Hurricane Center in Miami. It has not intensified in the last few hours, he said. It is expected to pass north of the Hawaiian islands in three to four days. However, Avlia said it was still too far away to predict its actual path. 'Hawaii should be more interested now in Hurricane Iselle, which is closer to the Hawaiian Islands,' he said. Hawaiian Airlines will waive reservation change fees and fare differences for passengers who need to alter travel plans because of the storms. The airline said fees will be waived for those who are ticketed to travel on Thursday and Friday. They will be allowed to change reservations for flights through Aug. 12. Hawaii has been directly hit by hurricanes only three times since 1950, though the region has had 147 tropical cyclones over that time. The last time Hawaii was hit with a tropical storm or hurricane was in 1992, when Hurricane Iniki killed six people and destroyed more than 1,400 homes in Kauai, Lau said. Two big storms so close together is rare in the eastern Pacific, and Hurricane Iselle could make landfall by Friday and Tropical Storm Julio could hit two or three days later . 'We've been lucky so far. So we just need to really take this threat seriously and make sure everybody is prepared,' he said. When a pallet full of bottled water ran out at a Honolulu warehouse store Tuesday, shoppers loading up on supplies hovered around until a worker refilled it. Then, it quickly emptied again. 'Days like today, in a situation like this, we just throw open the doors and hold on for the ride,' said Scott Ankrom, assistant general manager of the Costco. The busy store near downtown has had to continually restock water and sold as much of it on Monday as it sold all last week, he said. Judy Castillo of Oahu said she wanted to make sure her family was prepared before big crowds flooded stores and shelves emptied. 'Two storms in a row? It's like, hello,' she said, pushing a cart with two cases of water and other items from a drug store to her car. A grocery store in the coastal Oahu community of Waianae opened 15 minutes early Tuesday because people were already lined up to buy supplies. Bottled water and cans of Spam and Vienna Sausage flew off the shelves, said Charlie Gustafson, general manager of Tamura's Supermarket. Chris Pruett of Waikiki was anticipating the silver lining that comes from bad weather: good waves. 'We're just getting water and preparing ourselves, too, because it could be bad,' he said. 'Of course we're not looking for a storm ... but it tends to generate good waves.' The second storm system heightened the urgency to prepare, Hawaii County Civil Defense Director Darryl Oliveira said Tuesday. His county, also known as the Big Island, was expected to see Iselle first. The clustered storms are rare but not unexpected in years with a developing El Nino, a change in ocean temperature that affects weather around the world. In the Atlantic Ocean, Tropical Storm Bertha continues to weaken as it moves north, posing no direct threat to the U.S. East Coast. Though it's not clear how damaging the storms could be, many in Hawaii aren't taking any chances as they wait for Hurricane Iselle to make landfall later this week . The storm's maximum sustained winds decreased to near 50 mph Tuesday evening with even more weakening expected over the next two days. On Sunday, the storm buffeted parts of the Bahamas and the Turks & Caicos with rain and gusty winds, after passing over the Dominican Republic. Earlier, it dumped rain on Puerto Rico. Ahead of this year's hurricane season, weather officials warned that the wide swath of the Pacific Ocean that includes Hawaii could see four to seven tropical cyclones this year. Before Hurricane Iniki hit Hawaii in 1992, the last hurricane slammed the islands in 1982. 'The central Pacific doesn't see nearly the activity that the Atlantic sees,' said James Franklin, chief of hurricane specialists for the National Hurricane Center in Miami. In preparation, some people in Hawaii are making sure to vote early in the primary elections, which are Saturday. The elections include several marquee races, including primaries for U.S. Senate, governor and a U.S. House seat covering urban Honolulu.","Hurricane Iselle could strke as early as Thursday followed by Hurricane Julio .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Under-fire John Bercow was today accused of behaving like royalty after enjoying more than £11,000 of hospitality at top flight sporting events. The Commons Speaker was wined and dined at a dozen tennis and football matches, including seats in the Royal Box at Wimbledon. He insists he is ‘representing the Commons’ at the Queen’s Club, Everton and West Ham but critics said he should concentrate on the day job. In June this year John Bercow enjoyed seats at Wimbledon with Philip Brook, chairman of the All England club . Pressure is mounting on Mr Bercow, amid claims his impartiaility make him unsuitable for the job. Respected outgoing Commons clerk Sir Robert Rogers used his parting shot to warn Mr Bercow he had to be fair to all political parties. And an anonymous Commons motion has been circulated in Parliament demanding he quit after failing to ‘live up to the tradition of impartiality’ of his predecessors. This week he has face criticism for handing a parliamentary pass to wealthy businesswoman and Labour donor Farah Sassoon, a friend of his wife Sally who has since donated £5,000 to Mr Bercow’s bid for re-election. The money was logged in his register of interests alongside an enviable list of sporting events he has enjoyed in the last year – free of charge. Tory MP Michael Fabricant said the trips to sporting events suggested Mr Bercow considers himself to be  'either a member of Government or the Royal Family' It includes watching Roger Federer lose to Novak Djokovic in the Wimbledon final this year, sitting in the Royal Box just feet from William and Kate. The freebie was worth £4,315 and followed a £1,895 day out to SW19 barely a week earlier. It was also a step up from Centre Court worth £148 paid for by the Lawn Tennis Association at last year’s Wimbledon championships . Last year he also had a week’s pass to the ATP World Tour in November worth £1,000 and Barclays paid for two tickets worth £200. There have also been two tickets to West Ham football club, two tickets to Everton and two tickets for a match supplied by the FA. A spokesman for Mr Bercow said: ‘Britain is a great sporting nation; the Speaker, who in accordance with the rules declares the cost of any ticket of sporting events he is invited to, is a big sports fan. 'It is no secret that he is an enthusiast of football and tennis; he is an Arsenal season ticket holder - as is his eldest son - and was a junior tennis champion. 'He regards it as part of his role in representing the House of Commons to support British sports and is honoured to have been invited to events such as Wimbledon. 'In accordance with the rules. He declares the cost of any ticket. Tory Michael Fabricant told MailOnline: ‘John Bercow clearly believes his role transcends that of merely being Speaker. ‘He clearly now considers himself a representative of the State: either as a member of Government or the Royal Family. ‘Neither of which he is. This is an interesting innovation. Personally, I'd rather he adopted the new role, for him, of being an impartial Speaker.’ Mr Bercow is a self-declared tennis nut, and has written a book called Tennis Maestros on his favourite 20 male players of all time. His register of interests includes £2,000 in expenses from publisher BiteBack towards writing the tome. Criticism of the Speaker has mounted in recent weeks, after he has appeared to repeatedly mock David Cameron in the Commons and faced accusations of being rude to staff. One of the most bizarre exchanges came as Mr Cameron took questions during a lengthy sessions on Gaza and the Malaysian Airlines MH17 atrocity. Farah Sassoon, who is a friend and drinking partner of Sally Bercow (pictured together above after an awards ceremony last year), has donated £5,000 to Mr Bercow’ s 2015 campaign in his Buckingham seat . Mr Bercow interrupted proceedings to say: ‘Somebody asked how long the statement would run, but I would just point out, if I may, that there is intense interest in it and that the frequency of the Prime Minister’s tennis playing on the one hand and his jogging regime on the other means that he is quite fit enough, I am sure.’ This week he has faced calls for an official inquiry over why he gave a parliamentary pass to Mrs Sassoon - allowing full unescorted access to the Palace of Westminster – two years ago. She is a friend and drinking partner of Mr Berow’s wife, Sally, and was pictured cavorting in the back of a taxi with Mrs Bercow last year.

"By . Andrew Levy . Deputy council leader Myfanwy Alexander has resigned in disgrace after using the N-word during a meeting . A deputy council leader has resigned in disgrace after using the N-word during a meeting. Myfanwy Alexander uttered the derogatory term during a debate on cross-border health services between England and Wales. In a shocking rant, the Powys county councillor complained: ‘We are treated like n****** over the border.’ She initially refused to step down, claiming the language she used was intended to ‘fight prejudice and unequal treatment’. But her position became untenable after opposition councillors – whose support is needed for the minority group of Independents to run the authority - threatened to call a vote of no confidence. Cllr Alexander, 52, delivered a bitter parting shot to her colleagues in her resignation letter, accusing them of lacking ‘loyalty’. ‘This matter appears to be feeding the toxic nature of division within the county council. It has been made clear to me that I cannot remain on the cabinet,’ she wrote. ‘I am not a racist and I believe that by resigning I am accepting a slur on my character which is entirely untrue. ‘My resignation has not been tendered without pressure and I would have expected to encounter more loyalty. ‘It is, alas, a situation which has to be resolved and you are of the opinion that I should resign.’ She also used her Twitter account to blast the ‘venom of parish pump politics’. The row began on July 29 when Cllr Alexander, an Independent responsible for education and children’s services, complained to a cabinet meeting about some patients’ treatment when they travelled to Shropshire for healthcare. She described how her name and that of a constituent had been dismissed as a ‘meaningless jumble of letters’ by NHS staff in England. She then asked fellow councillors what they thought would have happened if her constituent had been called Ranjit and had tried to access healthcare outside Wales. Reference: Council leader Barry Thomas said Cllr Alexander was referring to Maya Angelou's (pictured) description of unfair health treatment in the Southern States of America when she made her comment . ‘We are treated like n****** over the border. Our language and culture is trampled on and it’s a very sensitive issue,’ she added. ‘It’s not our fault that we don’t have a district general hospital to go to.’ Cllr Alexander went on to talk about another occasion when she asked if a Welsh-speaking nurse could say good morning to her father during a stay in hospital. She claimed she was told: ‘That’s fine as long as you don’t mind your father being considered to be racist.’ A special meeting was arranged the following day to decide what action to take. Council leader Barry Thomas said afterwards his deputy had been ‘severely reprimanded’ and referred for equality training but would be allowed to keep her job. He said she had used the offensive word because she was ‘referring to Maya Angelou’s description of unfair health treatment in the Southern States of America and that no offence was intended. ‘She said she used the vivid language as a way of fighting prejudice and unequal treatment.’ The comments are said to refer to Angelou’s first autobiography, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, released in 1969. The African-American author, who dealt with themes including racism, died earlier this year. But Cllr Alexander, who lives with her four daughters in a £250,000 16th century cottage in Llanfair Caereinion, near Welshpool, tendered her resignation as anger grew among colleagues. Fellow councillor Stephen Hayes said: ‘Her comments, made in a meeting open to the public, show a desperate failure to understand what is appropriate behaviour and language for someone holding public office.’ Welsh Conservatives leader Aled Davies said she had ‘stepped over the line’. A council spokesman said Cllr Alexander would continue representing the Banwy ward.","Myfanwy Alexander, 52, used term during debate on health services .

"By . Grant Mccabe . Derek Grant, 38, pleaded guilty to the culpable homicide of Patrick Bradley (pictured), who blinded  father-of three Grant in one eye when he was confronted after stealing Grant's son's phone . A man killed a thief who stole his son’s iPhone after using a mobile phone application to track him down. Derek Grant’s son Jordan, a university student, was held up by convicted thug Patrick Bradley as he made his way home from work last August. The 20-year-old and his father used a mobile phone app to track down the missing phone – and found it, and Bradley with it. Derek Grant, of Greenock, Renfrewshire, demanded the handset from Bradley – who then blinded the father-of-four in one eye by stabbing him in the face. But a badly-hurt Grant retaliated by knifing the 29-year-old and fatally injuring him. It led to the 38-year-old former driver being charged and yesterday, at the High Court in Glasgow, he admitted the culpable homicide of Bradley. A judge heard how Grant had only reacted after being subjected to ‘extreme violence’ and that the incident was a ‘tragedy’ for his ‘high achieving’ family. Grant was remanded in custody and will learn his fate next month, but culpable homicide can lead to a prison sentence in double figures. The court heard how Jordan Grant had been returning to his home, late last August 30 when he was confronted by knife-wielding Bradley. The thief - who had a significant record for violence - ordered the McDonalds worker to hand over his iPhone, which he did. Jordan Grant went home and told his father who, using the ‘Find My iPhone’ app – discovered the mobile was still close by. Derek Grant then left his home in the town with Jordan and his two younger sons Lee, 17, and 16-year-old Jamie. They spotted Bradley, whom they did not know - and Derek Grant ordered him to hand back the stolen phone. But Bradley instead lashed out at Grant and knifed him in the left eye. His frantic son Jordan screamed for help. But his father repeatedly struck out at Bradley with a knife he had taken from home, having feared for his safety. Bradley suffered a cardiac arrest and died following the incident. He was found at an address in the town at around 1.15am and taken to Inverclyde Royal Hospital but subsequently died. Grant was arrested and he later said: ‘I wish to declare for the record that at the time of this incident, I was acting in self-defence.’ Derek Grant’s son Jordan, a university student, was held up by convicted thug Patrick Bradley as he made his way home from work last August . Grant had faced a murder charge before prosecutors yesterday accepted his guilty plea to the reduced charge of culpable homicide. His three sons were also accused of murder, but their not guilty pleas were accepted. Advocate depute Douglas Fairley, QC, said it was agreed Grant had suffered a ‘significant’ degree of provocation before the fatal assault. Grant’s lawyer, Ian Duguid, yesterday told the court that he only lashed out as a ‘reaction to the extreme violence’ he had faced. Mr Duguid added that what happened had been a ‘tragedy’ and ‘catastrophic’ for a law-abiding family. The court heard Jordan Grant was a university politics student, another son had hopes of being a footballer while a third was doing well at school. The hearing was also told that Grant had been forced to give up his job as a driver after losing the sight in his left eye. The High Court in Glasgow heard how Grant had only reacted after being subjected to 'extreme violence' Mr Duguid went on: ‘It may become evident this is a family of high achievement.’ Lord Boyd remanded Grant in custody and deferred sentencing until September 1 at the High Court in Livingston. Last year, Gulf War hostage John Nichol condemned police for failing to confront a thief who stole his wife’s iPhone – despite being told exactly where it was. The £500 phone’s tracking software instantly revealed its location and the former RAF Tornado navigator passed the information to detectives. But they were apparently ‘too busy’ to retrieve the phone. Instead, they bombarded Mr Nichol and his wife with phone calls asking them to fill in forms and offering victim support. Mr Nichol, who was shot down during the 1991 Gulf War, held prisoner and paraded on Iraqi TV, was incredulous at their response to the disappearance of the phone, as his wife attended a meeting at her London office. He added: ‘The thing about this is you can put a tracker on it. So we watched my wife’s iPhone getting out of the meeting, going along the road, getting on the Tube, getting out at Clapham Junction and making its way to a house in Clapham.’","Derek Grant tracked son Jordan's phone to thief Patrick Bradley .

"By . Sam Cunningham . Follow @@samcunningham . Sami Hyypia is remembered fondly on the red half of Merseyside as Big Sami, for his decade playing at the heart of Liverpool’s defence. But since he has turned to football management his approach has drawn comparison more with England manager Roy Hodgson than West Ham boss Sam Allardyce, the original Big Sam. Those who work closely with the Finn describe a manager who knows what he wants, demands high standards and carries an air of authority wherever he goes. Losing hurts him, they say, even if it is just in a pre-season friendly. New man at the top: Sami Hyypia is tasked with leading Brighton's promotion charge . When Brighton and Hove Albion started to look for a replacement for the departing Oscar Garcia, they wanted a modern manager suitable for their structure and philosophy — a hybrid of the continental model, where the man in charge focuses on little else other than the team, and the more traditional English style where the manager does practically everything. After an exhaustive recruitment process led by chairman Tony Bloom and chief executive Paul Barber, Hyypia emerged as an early favourite. They interviewed those who played with him and played for him, who coached him and had been coached by him, anyone he had come into contact with in the game. And the pair agreed on the 40-year-old, who has evolved from the scruffy yet formidable centre back signed by Gerard Houllier in 1999 into a suave manager. His face is one not to be messed with; nose slightly bent from too many tussles with centre forwards and chiselled cheekbones. Fierce competitor: Hyypia was a formidable centre back during his time at Liverpool . Landing a manager who had just spent two years in charge at Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen, including leading them into the Champions League before he was sacked in April, was a statement of intent. Speak to people at Brighton and they talk of being ‘Premier League ready’. They have just opened a £32million academy and training ground which has been awarded the highest score ever by the Premier League’s independent auditors. Their £93million, 30,500-capacity stadium has had the highest average Championship gates in the past two seasons. Winning mentality: Hyypia was part of the Liverpool team that lifted the Champions League in 2005 . Barber handles the commercial side and negotiations for the biggest deals, head of football David Burke runs every other department and Hyypia has to rubber-stamp it all while focusing on his team. They all report directly to Bloom. Burke worked behind the scenes at Southampton between 2010 and 2012. Previously he was in Manchester City’s recruitment department and before that worked on Fulham’s now flourishing academy. Burke said: ‘What sold the club to Sami was not only everything in place with the structure from the continental model, like he had in Germany, but that he gets the choice on everything, like the British model. Everyone takes direction from the manager but then leaves him to concentrate on getting the team ready for the next game. In the hotseat: Hyypia took over following the departure of Oscar Garcia . ‘Southampton is a fair comparison to how it works. This system is designed so there is minimal distraction for the manager. ‘We don’t say you have to sign this player or we’re going to sell that one, if he wants scouting reports or suggestions of players we provide them.’ At Leverkusen, Hyppia lost Andre Schurrle to Chelsea for £18m, but he was then replaced by a player at a fraction of that fee. He admits he had very little say in any transfers. But he is so comfortable with Brighton’s model he has brought in just one member of staff so far — goalkeeping coach Antti Niemi. Summer signing: Aaron Hughes has arrived on a free transfer after being released by QPR . He has also made four signings since joining, including Aaron Hughes, who played at Fulham under Hodgson and sees similarities in his new manager’s meticulous approach. Hughes said: ‘Sometimes it was repetitive, but you saw the success we had at Fulham and I see some of the same things here.’ Now 34, Hughes was plying his trade in the Premier League when Hyypia was winning the Champions League, Uefa Cup, FA Cups and League Cups. Barber added: ‘His work ethic, commitment and desire are frankly what you expect from someone who has played the game at the highest level. He’s hit the ground running. ‘One thing we’ve noticed is that he’s a winner. Losing pre-season friendlies bothers him, it hurts him. It’s a character trait we like.’ The minimum expectation this season is to reach the play-offs, where they have fallen short in the last two campaigns. If Hyypia is the final piece in the jigsaw to make Brighton ‘Premier League ready’, Big Sami could soon be joining Big Sam on the top-flight touchline.","Former Liverpool defender in charge of Seagulls' promotion push .

"By . Chris Wheeler . Follow @@ChrisWheelerDM . Louis van Gaal is unlikely to get carried away by the fact that Manchester United touched down in England  with the Guinness International Cup in their possession. The Dutchman is experienced enough to know that victories like the one over Liverpool in the final in Miami might score a few points with the supporters but are worth very little else. There are far bigger tests to come. However, the manager he defeated at the Sun Life Stadium believes the new United boss might still be in for a rude awakening when the new Premier League season starts a week on Saturday. VIDEO Scroll down for Louis van Gaal closely supervising Manchester United training . Looking good: Wayne Rooney scored in the win over Liverpool in Miami . Brendan Rodgers warned that Van Gaal will not have experienced the type of intense competition inherent to English football during his spells in charge at Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Ajax, in countries where one or two clubs routinely dominate. Van Gaal has won titles at all three clubs in Spain, Germany and Holland. But Rodgers believes he will have a battle on his hands to add the Premier League to that list. ‘I think he’ll find the competition in this league will be different to any other league that he’s worked in,’ said the Liverpool boss. ‘In a lot of the other leagues, there are one or two teams and those are the teams that are expected to win. Silver lining: Darren Fletcher and Rooney celebrate with the Guinness International Champions Cup . Ajax (Sept, 1991) The Dutch powerhouses had won only one of the previous six league titles but Van Gaal, in his first managerial post, went on to win a hat-trick of titles, a Champions League trophy and a UEFA Super Cup. Barcelona (July, 1997) Taking over from Bobby Robson, Van Gaal won two back-to-back league titles and a Copa del Rey. AZ Alkmaar (July, 2005) Alkmaar had established a reputation as a solid, mid-table club. Van Gaal mounted a title challenge in his first season and after an 11th-placed blip in 2007-08, won their first title in 28 years. ‘This is a league where the top team plays the bottom team and on any given day you can lose. ‘I think the competition will probably take him by (surprise), and that’s from foreign managers I have spoken to over the years. 'I’ve worked closely with foreign players, and that real physical competitive nature will be different to anywhere else he’s worked before.’ Liverpool certainly did their best to emphasise the point in Miami. Steven Gerrard put them ahead from the penalty spot and last season’s runners-up could have been more goals to the good before United hit back to win 3-1 with second-half strikes from Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata and Jesse Lingard. It means Van Gaal won all five games on tour, albeit beating Inter Milan on penalties. When Rodgers’ comments were put to the United boss, he responded with the smile of a man who knows what to expect. All together: Juan Mata is mobbed by his teammates after his goal . VIDEO Van Gaal wants reinforcements . Touching down: Louis van Gaal arrives back in Manchester after winning in America . ‘That’s why I’m here,’ said Van Gaal. ‘OK maybe he is right because I have to experience that, but I was also in Spain and in my first year I won three titles. In Germany I won two titles. If I win one here, we will all be happy.’ Asked the value of winning the tournament, he replied: ‘Nothing. It’s nice for the fans in the USA — also at home — that we beat Liverpool. It’s not our favourite opponent, I think, for Man United fans. We’ve given a lot of pleasure to these fans and that’s very important. ‘Of course it is better to win in pre-season than to lose. But the most important game is Swansea at home in the first game, that’s the one we have to win.’ As well as managing two top clubs in close proximity to one another, Van Gaal and Rodgers also work under American owners. Although the Northern Irishman spoke of his respect for his new rival and his belief that United will be title challengers again this season, he still believes Van Gaal’s predecessor David Moyes was let down by the Glazers during his ill-fated season in charge at Old Trafford. ‘I think there were a lot of things at Manchester United that were not seen by many,’ said Rodgers. ‘David had to go in and where I felt for him is that he thought he was getting time. He signed a long-term deal and thought he had that longevity. It just shows you. You have to win games and hopefully then you get the chance. That’s where I’m very fortunate here. I’ve got brilliant owners. I’ve been clear in terms of how I’ve wanted to work and I’ve been able to work.’ Warning: Brendan Rodgers says Louis van Gaal will find managing Manchester United tough . Asked if United can emulate Liverpool by recovering from a seventh-place finish to challenge for the title again, Rodgers said: ‘I think it will be a totally different mindset. Domestically, for the last 20 years they’ve been champions 13 times. So they already have something in place. When I came to Liverpool, we were eighth at the time and the club was nearly going out of business, so it’s totally different. ‘The United players will be disappointed with where they finished last year, of course. With the quality they have, they will want to push on.’","Manchester United beat Liverpool in the final of the International Champions Cup in America .

"By . Paul Newman . Follow @@Paul_NewmanDM . The first real rain of the Test summer forced England into Old Trafford’s indoor nets temporarily on Wednesday where the sound of the Pharrell Williams anthem Happy was blaring out while they went about their business ahead of the fourth Test. Certainly the comprehensive win in Southampton and the subsequent clearing of Jimmy Anderson of ‘abusing and pushing’ Ravindra Jadeja has put smiles back on the faces of England’s players after nearly a year of abject misery. Even Anderson was ‘less grumpy’ than usual, according to Alastair Cook, and the man who is poised to become England’s leading Test wicket-taker will take to his home ground without the shadow of suspension hanging over him. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Cook hinting at Finn return . Spring in his step: Jimmy Anderson is raring to go on his home ground of Old Trafford . India were starting to resemble Monty Python’s Black Knight by refusing to give up on getting Anderson banned until ICC chief executive Dave Richardson, thankfully, stood up to them and confirmed there would be no appeal. The end of the matter? Well, all eyes will be on Anderson in this pivotal match to see whether ‘James’ again allows his alter ego ‘Jimmy’ out of his Burnley attic and unleashes him on the sensitive souls in the Indian team. Richardson made a point yesterday of warning against ‘personal’ sledging; pointing out to MS Dhoni that he may have put on a pound or two of weight, or words to that effect, are the type of verbals that Anderson must cut out. What Cook has to ensure is that the leader of his attack can summon the aggression which has helped take him to within 12 wickets of Sir Ian Botham’s England record without crossing the line that he often dangerously treads. Time to shine: Peter Moores speaks to the England squad ahead of the fourth Test . Two productive matches for Anderson here and at The Oval next week should be enough to see that record broken and a series victory for an England side who are now seeking to replicate their near complete third Test display. The England captain was adamant hat he has no problem with Anderson’s conduct and that he does not want the leader of his attack to become all ‘nicey nicey’, which is something he has never been accused of. Old Trafford, where England last year retained the Ashes before their world fell apart, is set to provide the quickest, bounciest pitch of this Investec series and Anderson was desperate to be available to try to exploit it. ‘For him to be playing here means a lot,’ said Cook. ‘That’s what the biggest concern was — that he wouldn’t get to play at Old Trafford. Now he can play in a home Test, which I know is special to everyone who does that. Unfortunately we don’t play Test cricket at Chelmsford, so I don’t think I’ll ever experience that.’ Catching practice: Alastair Cook does fielding practice on Wednesday . VIDEO Cook hints at Finn return . England plan to field the same side who ended their 10-Test winless run, meaning that Chris Jordan and Chris Woakes get another chance to support Anderson and Stuart Broad with the wickets that eluded them in Southampton. ‘You always try to pick the best team but you have to also consider continuity,’ said Cook. ‘You don’t want guys in the team always looking over their shoulder. The most successful sides are built on stability.’ There must have been a temptation for England to throw Steven Finn, who has looked back to his old self in the Old Trafford nets, into the fray but they are right not to jettison Jordan on the back of one indifferent match. In good spirits: The England team looked to be enjoying themselves as they prepared for the Old Trafford . Jordan was superb at Old Trafford in the one-day victory over Sri Lanka earlier this season and seems to have suffered for being dropped after two Tests against Sri Lanka in the clamour to re introduce Ben Stokes. England have to be careful they do not return to the days of too much chopping and changing and both Jordan and Woakes, who bowled well without luck at the Ageas Bowl, will now get the opportunity to settle in at the highest level. It seems certain that Broad will have the operation on his damaged right knee that has long looked necessary at the end of this series but he will not want to stand down just yet after returning, like Anderson, to his best last week. Both have mediocre records at Old Trafford and will want to improve them now. The senior players had been the problem for England up until now but with Cook, Anderson, Broad and Ian Bell all leading the way in Southampton the ‘new era’ suddenly has a much more positive feel about it. Not least for the captain. Ready to go: Ian Bell takes part in catching practice at Old Trafford . ‘It was great I scored runs last week and it was a big weight off my shoulders but it was only one game,’ said Cook. ‘I’m thinking of my batting the same way we’re approaching this match as a team. Last week counts for nothing.’ It is the way it has to be for England until they consistently get back to winning ways but they will never have a better chance of defeating an India side who travel so badly and rarely undertake five-Test series. Dhoni and his team looked sluggish in fielding practice yesterday, only livening up for the game of football they use as part of their warm-up that Dhoni in particular loves. ‘I’m missing my soccer for this,’ the ardent Manchester United fan was heard to say as he left his press conference yesterday. So Dhoni got to play football at Old Trafford — except it was the wrong Old Trafford. It is how one of the few cricketers who earns Premier League wages plays cricket here, as he faces up to a vindicated Jimmy Anderson, that will matter. And whether they exchange the odd word or two.","Jimmy Anderson is just 12 wickets short of Sir Ian Botham's record .

Healy's video will come as no surprise to regular followers of the Leinster loosehead prop - he often shows off on his Instagram and even occasionally DJs under the alias 'DJ Church'. The Irishman may have to fill his time for now but it won't be long until he is back in action with his club, and they face Northampton Saints in their season opener. Healy might no longer have the facial fuzz - aside from half a moustache that you would hope he saved off - but there's still plenty of time to growing it back before he kicks off the new campaign on August 23.

"By . Euan Mcarthur . Tommy Wright pulled no punches last night as he admitted his sloppy Saints only had themselves to blame for this dispiriting home defeat. Just seven days after rolling over the Swiss here in a dramatic penalty shoot-out, the Perth side’s Euro hopes was shattered by their Slovakian visitors in a disappointingly one-sided encounter. The Scottish Cup winners now need a glory night of similar proportions to that victory over Luzern if they are to turn the tables in the return leg. Class above: Ivan Schranz converts after Alan Mannus spilled his first effort to grab his second goal . St Johnstone: Mannus, Miller, Mackay, Wright, Easton, Brown, Millar (McDonald 29), Croft, Wotherspoon, O'Halloran (Kane 76), MacLean. Subs Not Used: Banks, Scobbie, Anderson, Caddis, Easton. Booked: Wright, Miller, Kane. Goals: Mackay 90. FC Spartak Trnava: Rusov, Siva, Bortel, Toth, Conka, Janecka, Sabo, Casado Garcia, Schranz (Mikinic 88), Vlasko (Chovanec 78), Mikovic (Vyskocil 61). Subs Not Used: Strapak, Richnak, Spalek, Kasaj. Booked: Bortel, Vlasko. Goals: Schranz 34, 64. Att: 7,001 . Skipper Dave Mackay gave them an outside chance courtesy of his injury-time strike, but Ivan Schranz was the two-goal hero for Spartak. His 34-minute opener was stunning but his second just after the hour mark was a gift after Scott Brown was punished for a wayward back pass. A less-than-impressed Wright insisted the tie wasn’t over but said: ‘We’ve got to do a lot better to give ourselves a chance. ‘We can’t play for 15 minutes at the start of the second half and five to 10 minutes at the end and expect to beat teams who are technically very good. ‘We played into their hands because we didn’t perform in the first half. That was the most disappointing thing. ‘I can’t really blame Scott Brown because he attempts to play a pass at their second goal and it goes in a different direction. ‘We just gave away too much possession in bad areas and the decision making was poor. I wasn’t happy at half time because we didn’t even compete. That’s not like us. We didn’t win second balls and it was all too easy for them. ‘We were better at the start of the second half and Gary Miller has a great chance to make it 1-1. Then straight after that they get their second goal.’ Wright insisted Saints must show their real qualities next week to avoid spinning out of Europe. ‘We’ve still got a chance The tie is alive but we’ve got to play better. We’re not often out-worked our out-competed but that’s what happened and with the quality they have, they hurt us. The real St Johnstone have to turn up in the return leg.’ Without striker Stevie May, sidelined with a thigh injury, Saints struggled from the offset and, in truth, the damage could have been a lot worse had slick Spartak taken all of their chances. It was hoped the return of Wright to the dug-out following the death of his mother would inspire the hosts. But the visitors began more brightly and Saints had keeper Allan Mannus to thank for keeping them at bay. With 12 minutes gone, skipper Marek Janecka’s pass released Schranz, and his driven shot was well saved by Mannus at his near post. From the corner, Schranz rose tallest to meet Jan Vlasko’s dead-ball but his header was by tipped over this time. Top dog: Schranz celebrates scoring his second goal which should see his side through . Midway through the first-half, playmaker Vlasko went on another driving run which ended in his ambitious effort from 25 yards taking a deflection and going behind. Saints suffered an unexpected blow when Chris Millar limped off to be replaced by substitute Gary McDonald. Things went from bad to worse when Spartak went ahead in some style just after half an hour. Vlasko, who had been orchestrating play since kick-off, slid a perfect pass through to Schranz. He galloped free of a static Saints defence, before rifling an unstoppable left-foot finish from inside the penalty area beyond the reach of Mannus. It was no more than Spartak deserved for their enterprising efforts throughout the first-half. Saints surely couldn’t be so poor after the break and, within minutes of the restart, they forced the visiting keeper into a save. David Wotherspoon latched on to Michael O’Halloran’s through ball, only to see his effort held comfortably by Dobrivoj Rusov. Consolation: Dave Mackay is congratulated on his stoppage time goal which gave the Saints hope . That gave the largely subdued home crowd a much-needed lift and their favourites ought to have equalised in 56 minutes. Full-back Brian Easton sent over a tempting cross deep into the Slovakian penalty area which was met by the on-rushing Gary Miller. He failed to hold his nerve, however, and headed wide from 10 yards. Saints’ brief resurgence came to an abrupt end in 63 minutes when Spartak went two in front. Brown’s attempted pass-back was woefully short and Schranz seized upon a golden opportunity, rounding Mannus to roll the ball home. Soon after, Spartak threatened to pile more misery on Wright’s men when Vlasko set up Erik Sabo, but he fired wide with just Mannus to beat. The Perth side refused to give up and Mackay’s fine finish low into the corner from Wotherspoon’s cross gives them some hope. Spartak boss Juraj Jarabek felt his players more than deserved their victory but refused to accept his team were home and dry . ‘We scored two goals on the night and I believe there was a third goal just hanging there,’ he said. ‘But St Johnstone are a very good team and they will fight to the last minute so the tie is not over.’ Hard to take: The Saints will have to raise themselves again to have any chance in the second leg .","St Johnstone continued their dreadful recent home form .

"By . Garry Doolan . Manchester United's International Champions Cup clash with European champions Real Madrid on Saturday  is expected to provide the largest crowd ever for a football match in America. The ‘Big House’ stadium in Michigan is expected to welcome 109,000 fans and is the largest ground in the States. Fitting, then, that such a crowd should be entertained by some of the world’s best players from two of the most iconic clubs on the planet. If America doesn’t ‘get’ football after this, it arguably never will. VIDEO Scroll down to watch International Champions Cup highlights . Heading for the final: Manchester United are poised to top Group A in the International Champions Cup . While many Americans will struggle to tell their Rooneys from their Ronaldos, the one thing they are sure to understand is money. Forbes, the esteemed American business magazine, have published a Top 10 of the world’s most valuable clubs, with United and Real occupy two of the top three spots. The European champions lead with an estimated total value of £2.04billion, but United are not far behind with £1.71bn. Sandwiched in the middle are Barcelona at £1.9bn. But for all their spending, Real cannot make the final of the tournament on Monday no matter the result against United. Louis van Gaal’s side lead Group A and could face either Manchester City or Liverpool in the final in Miami. United won on penalties against Inter Milan in Washington DC after beating Roma 3-2 in Denver. Roma and Inter both have three points after two games, while Madrid's defeat by Roma on Tuesday ended their hopes of qualifying for the final. Liverpool lead Group B, one point ahead of Manchester City. Greek side Olympiacos, who are also in contention to make the final, follow with three points, while AC Milan are yet to get off the mark. Stateside following: The Red Devils have enjoyed large support during their tour . All teams play three fixtures before the winners of each group meet in Miami. Group A results: United 3 Roma 2; Real Madrid 1 Inter 1 (Inter 3-2 pens); United 0 v Inter 0 (United 5-3 pens), Real Madrid 0 Roma 1 . Group B results: Olympiacos 3 AC Milan 0; AC Milan 1 Man City 5; Liverpool 1 Olympiacos 0; Liverpool 2 Man City 2 (Liverpool 3-1 pens) Fixtures: (2 Aug) United v Real Madrid, Inter v Roma, AC Milan v Liverpool, Olympiacos v Man City . sfd .

(Lucas and Nacho scored from the spot for Real) 0-1 Roma (Dallas Cotton Bowl, July 29) Not so pretty in pink: Madrid have lost both of their games in the tournament . TRANSFERS THIS SUMMER . Manchester United have so far spent a total of £55m, although van Gaal is expect to add more players once the Red Devils return from the States. After two years of nearly signing central-midfielder Ander Herrera, the 24-year-old finally arrived this summer in a £29m deal from Athletic Bilbao. Teenaged defender Luke Shaw’s departure from Southampton was equally nothing of a surprise and his transfer fee of £27m could rise to £31.5m depending upon appearances. Big money: Luke Shaw joined United from Southampton for a fee which could rise to £31.5million . Toni Kroos had been linked with a move to United for much of last season, but the 24-year-old midfielder eventually clinched a £20m switch to the Bernabeu after winning the World Cup with Germany. However, Madrid’s marquee signing came in the shape of Colombia’s World Cup inspiration James Rodriguez. The striker’s £63m switch from Monaco is big business. The 23-year-old won the Golden Boot in Brazil and ensured Madrid kept pace with Barcelona and their purchase of Liverpool’s Luis Suarez. World Cup star: James Rodriguez signed for Madrid in a £63million deal after impressing for Colombia in Brazil . WHERE THE MONEY COMES FROM . Manchester United have just signed a world-record £750m kit deal with German's sportswear giant adidas. The 10-year partnership puts United way out ahead of Europe’s other leading clubs, although it will be cut by 30 per cent if they fail to qualify for the Champions League for two consecutive seasons. United stay with Nike until 2015-16 campaign. United have also secured a shirt sponsorship deal with £53m a year with leading luxury American car company Chevrolet. United’s Old Trafford is usually a sell-out for home Premier League games with a capacity of 75,731. United have an overall average income of around £380m per year. First and last: Nike will supply United for the final time during the 2014-15 season before adidas take over, while Chevrolet have just started a sponsorship deal worth £53m-a-year . Real Madrid are also tied to adidas, with a shirt deal worth £31m a year until 2020. Their kit sponsorship arrangement with the Emirates airline brings in an additional £23m-a-year. Real’s iconic Bernabeu can seat 85,454 when full and the club's revenue at the last reckoning was said to be worth around £428m-a-year. Big money available: Madrid's commercial deals have allowed them to pay world record transfer deals for the likes of Gareth Bale (left) and Cristiano Ronaldo . MANAGERS . Manchester United - Louis van Gaal (Born Amsterdam, aged 62): Former manager of Ajax, Barcelona, AZ, Bayern Munich and Holland. Manchester United manager since June 2014.

"By . Jane Flanagan In Cape Town . Oscar Pistorius got into a nightclub brawl after being approached about the murder trial by a man, his spokeswoman said . Oscar Pistorius got into a nightclub brawl after being approached by a man who 'aggressively engaged' the athlete about his ongoing murder trial. The 27-year-old double amputee was apparently pushed over in the incident, which took place on Saturday night as he was having a drink with his cousin. Pistorius’ spokesman confirmed 'an altercation' took place, but said the sprinter was confronted by racing driver Jared Mortimer about the sprinter’s trial. 'The individual, according to my client, started to aggressively interrogate him on matters relating to the trial,' she said. 'An argument ensued during which my client asked to be left alone. Oscar soon thereafter left the club with his cousin. 'My client regrets the decision to go to a public space and thereby inviting unwelcome attention.' Pistorius is accused of murdering his girlfriend of three months in a fatal shooting at his home. According to Mr Mortimer, however, the athlete – known as the Blade Runner because of his carbon fibre prosthetics – was 'drunk and very aggressive' at the VIP Room night club. He said he prodded Mr Mortimer in the chest while telling him 'you’ll never get the better of me'. Mr Mortimer also told The Star newspaper that the athlete insulted the family of Jacob Zuma, the South African president. Mr Mortimer told a gossip website that he then shoved Pistorius, sending him falling backwards into a chair, which prompted bouncers at club in the exclusive Johannesburg suburb of Sandton, to intervene and break up the row. The incident comes just days after Pistorius’s defence team closed its case in the lengthy murder trial. Pistorius denies deliberately killing Reeva Steenkamp and claims he shot her accidentally after mistaking her for a burglar.  The runner could learn his fate as early as next month. Mr Mortimer told The Juice website he . was introduced to Pistorius by a mutual friend and that the athlete . immediately began talking about the friends who had turned against him, . including Danny Fresco who gave evidence against Pistorius at his . trial. Jared Mortimer, a racing driver, pictured with Nelson Mandela, said Pistorius was 'drunk and very aggressive'. He said he prodded Mr Mortimer in the chest and said 'you'll never get the better of me' VIPs only: The VIP club, situated in the tower pictured in Sandton. According to Mr Mortimer, the duo's altercation happened here . He said: 'He was going on about how . influential his family is and how connected they are. He even pulled out . his phone to show me pictures of armoured cars.' Mr . Mortimer told The Juice that Pistorius poked him in the chest several . times. He said: 'He said you’ll never get the better of me. I’ll always . get the better of you.' During . the trial, the court heard extracts of a psychologist’s report which . found the athlete suffered from post-traumatic stress and severe . depression since the incident. Anneliese Burgess, the spokeswoman for Pistorius, told the Telegraph: 'They sat in a quiet area of the private VIP section when they were approached by the individual. 'The . individual in question, according to our client, started to . aggressively engage him on matters relating to the trial. An argument . ensued during which our client asked to be left alone. The brawl came after the athlete posted a wave of bizarre tweets, including this one in which he attached a collage of . photographs of him helping children with disabilities like his own . Salvation from pain: In another, he posted a photograph of a page from . Victor Frankl's memoir (left), Man's Search for Meaning, in which the Austrian . psychiatrist recounts his time as a prisoner at Auschwitz death camp. He finally posted one asking for God to heal pain (right) 'Oscar left soon thereafter with his cousin. Our client regrets the decision to go into a public place and thereby inviting unwelcome attention.' Pistorius has rarely been seen in public since the fatal shooting on Valentine’s Day last year. However, . over the weekend, not only was Pistorius out for a drink with his . cousin, but he also took to his twitter account to share a bizarre mixture of . images and messages with his followers. The series of tweets included photos of him posing with children and a passage from the memoir of an Auschwitz survivor. The . last time he left a message was on February 14th, the first anniversary . of the day he shot dead Miss Steenkamp through the bathroom door of his . Pretoria home. In one . of the tweets, he posted a photograph of his finger resting on a page . from Victor Frankl's memoir, Man's Search for Meaning, in which the . Austrian psychiatrist recounts his time as a prisoner at Auschwitz death . camp during the Second World War. Pistorius faces 25 years to life in prison if he is found guilty of murdering his law graduate and model girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, whom he shot and killed at his home in Pretoria on Valentine's Day last year . The passage included the words: 'The salvation of man is through love and in love. 'I . understood how a man who has nothing left in this world still may know . bliss, be it only for a brief moment, in the contemplation of his . beloved.' In another . tweet, he attached a collage of photographs of him helping children with . disabilities around the passage: 'You have the ability to make a . difference in someones life. 'Sometimes it's the simple things you say or do that can make someone feel better or inspire them.' Finally, . the South African known as 'The Blade Runner' posted a message that . read: 'Lord, today I ask that you bathe those who live in pain in the . river of your healing. Amen.' Pistorius . faces 25 years to life in prison if he is found guilty of murdering his . law graduate and model girlfriend Miss Steenkamp, whom he shot and . killed at his home in Pretoria on Valentine's Day last year. He . could also be sentenced to a shorter prison term if convicted of murder . without premeditation or negligent killing. Additionally, he faces . separate gun-related charges. Chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel says the prosecution will file closing arguments on July 30 and the defence will do so on August 4. The 27-year-old athlete says he killed Steenkamp by mistake, thinking an intruder was in the toilet and about to attack him. The prosecution says he shot her after a Valentine's Day argument last year. Pistorius . was born without fibulas, the slender bones that run from below the . knee to the ankle. Part of his lower legs were amputated when he was 11 . months old. Last week saw Mr Nel challenge the credibility of a physician who testified that the athlete has an anxious nature linked to his disability. Mr Nel said the defense witness, physician Wayne Derman, could not be objective about the double-amputee runner. The defence maintains that Pistorius has a deep sense of vulnerability because of his disability and a fear of crime, and it was a factor in the killing because he opened fire after thinking an intruder was in his house. Under questioning, Derman acknowledged that his testimony did not amount to a 'forensic report' but disputed Mr Nel's assertion that he could not give credible evidence because he was too familiar with Pistorius, having treated him over many years and traveled with him extensively.","The 27-year-old double amputee was apparently pushed over in the incident .

"By . Elliott Bretland . Follow @@EllBretland . Manchester United have experienced two very different pre-seasons over the last two summers. While David Moyes suffered defeats by poor opposition - losing 1-0 to the Singha All Stars, as well as being beated by Yokohama and going down 3-1 at home to Sevilla - new boss Louis van Gaal has beaten some of the best teams in world football. Unbeaten during the side's tour of America with wins over Real Madrid, Inter Milan and Roma, the Dutchman put even bigger smiles on the faces of the United faithful as he masterminded a 3-1 victory over arch-rivals Liverpool to land the International Champions Cup in Miami on Monday. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis van Gaal supervising Manchester United training . All smiles: Wayne Rooney holds aloft the International Champions Cup with United team-mate Darren Fletcher . Reasons to be cheerful: United are unbeaten this summer having faced some of the best sides in the world . Good and bad: While new boss Louis van Gaal remains unbeaten during pre-season, David Moyes struggled . Tough start: Former boss Moyes talks tactics with Wilfried Zaha during United's defeat to the Singha All Stars . While Van Gaal, fresh from guiding Holland to the World Cup semi-finals in Brazil, is giving United fans reasons to be optimistic, Moyes' pre-season of 2013 gave supporters the very opposite feeling. Anxious following the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson, the man who had delivered two decades of success to Old Trafford, they were worried further as Moyes lost his first game in charge of United to the Singha All-Star XI in Bangkok. The Red Devils went on to beat the A-League All Stars 5-1 but then lost 3-2 to Yokohama F Marinos and were also defeated by Sevilla during Rio Ferdinand's testimonial. The far from convincing pre-season set the tone for the campaign as Moyes endured a disastrous time in the Old Trafford hotseat. Eventually finishing the season in seventh place having failed to qualify for Europe, United sacked Moyes in April - two days after the Scot had lost to former club Everton - as the then defending champions suffered their worst season of the Premier League era.

Moyes' poor pre-season carried on into the new campaign as United failed to qualify for Europe . While Moyes suffered defeat in his first friendly in charge of United, Van Gaal got off to the perfect possible start with a resounding 7-0 victory over LA Galaxy. The Red Devils played scintilating football, new signing Ander Herrera gave a virtuoso performance, pulling the strings in midfield and the football world, prematurely, got excited about the new era of success United were about to embark on. It would be foolish to say United have returned to title-winning form off the back of five victories during a pre-season tour but the signs look positive. Star man: Ander Herrera gave a man-of-the-match performance against LA Galaxy in Van Gaal's first game . It's fair to say the . side's results this summer, along with the new 3-5-2 formation Van Gaal . has implemented with relative success, have given the United faithful . plenty to be optimistic about for the upcoming campaign. The . side under Van Gaal has scored the same number of goals as Moyes' charges last term but are certainly much tighter at the back having . conceded nine fewer. 'King . Louis' also seems to be getting the best out of the players who . under-performed last term; most notably Ashley Young. The wideman . struggled under the previous stewardship but has shone, and . scored, in America. Much improved: Ashley Young has drawn plaudits during the tour of America having played poorly last term . Meanwhile, talisman Rooney, who is likely . to be given the captain's armband, appears to be playing with a new . lease of life and a smile on his face. Rooney has said Van Gaal has invigorated the United squad and given players a different way of looking at the game. United's No 10 told the Manchester Evening News: ‘It's been a good few weeks, we've . got a new manager who wants us to play a different style of football. We've had to adapt. We've had some good results against top opposition . so we can be pleased. ‘I . think the system suits the team, not only myself. The manager came in . and had a look at the players we've got. He's done what he thinks is . best suited for our team. ‘He's . a tough manager but he's been great since he came in. He's given us all . a different way of looking at football, which we haven't had before.' VIDEO Van Gaal wants reinforcements . New system: Wayne Rooney says Louis van Gaal has given players a different way of looking at football . If pre-season is anything to go by, Manchester United will have no problems mounting a title challenge this season, with Valencia at home the final game of the club's preparations ahead of the next term. However, friendly records will mean nothing once the season is underway. Having passed all of the tests so far, the real judgements will be made on Van Gaal when Manchester United kick-off the new Barclays Premier League season against Swansea on August 16. Only then will we know of the true impact the Dutchman has had on a squad which struggled so often under Moyes.

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Mid-life health checks may be no more effective at picking up chronic conditions than regular GP consultations . Health MOTs routinely offered to over-40s on the NHS may be a waste of time, new research suggests. Illnesses picked up during the mid-life health checks could be 'equally well detected' without the scheme, it has been claimed. The NHS Health Check was launched in 2009 to assess and treat patients aged 40 to 74 for their risk of developing heart problems, diabetes, high blood pressure and kidney disease. But the new study claims the number of people being diagnosed with certain conditions has not risen since the programme was introduced. As a result, it appears that standard care provided by GPs is just as effective at detecting conditions such as diabetes and heart disease. It is not the first time the MOTs have come under fire. Last year researchers claimed the Government’s £300 million-a-year scheme actually puts patients at risk of unnecessary treatment. Worldwide trials involving 180,000 people showed it is the 'worried well’ who tend to turn up for the checks, meaning money is spent on reassuring them . rather than on treating the truly sick. At the . time, Clare Gerada, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, backed the . calls to end the routine checks, claiming they 'devalued medicine' and . led to patients being needlessly worried as family doctors waste time . on people who are not sick. 'You always find something that you can’t explain and then you do more tests,' she said. 'We’re constantly having to explain to patients that actually there’s nothing wrong.' In the new study, experts examined changes in the prevalence of key conditions among patients registered with GP practices that did and did not offer the service. These conditions were diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, chronic kidney disease and the heart rhythm disorder atrial fibrillation. The research looked at 38 surgeries in Warwickshire that offered the NHS Health Check and 41 in the area that just provided standard care, over a three-year period from 2010 to 2013. There was no difference in the prevalence of ailments between those than offered the checks and those that provided usual care, the authors said. 'The implication is that the provision of NHS Health Checks in GP practices may not be different from usual care,' they added. The study was published in the British Journal of General Practice.

"By . David Tyrer . A popularly held belief this summer is that Liverpool are in the midst of what has become known as ‘doing a Spurs’. Anybody not affiliated with the club seems to be in agreement that spending so much on so many players is going to end badly. There is basis for this argument but Liverpool’s situation is very different this summer. The comparisons, of course, stem from the fact that both clubs sold their best players for a handsome sum and went on something of a ‘spree’. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Brendan Rodgers: Liverpool will not 'do a Tottenham' New boys: Liverpool signed Southampton duo Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert earlier this summer . Thumbs up: Many of Liverpool's signings were targets before Luis Suarez moved to Barcelona for £75m . Spending spree: Tottenham received £86million for Gareth Bale from Real Madrid last summer but many of the club's subsequent signings failed to impress last term . Unlike the situation Spurs faced last year though, Liverpool already had many of these targets in their sights, while not a single player signed so far has been acquired using the money made from Suarez. From as early as the end of last season, it was clear that Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert and Emre Can were already targets. In the cases of Lallana and Lambert, Liverpool have signed two experienced Premier League players, with great track records and, while this is not a guarantee of success it makes that ‘bedding in’ period all the more easy. Not only this, but Lambert is a low-risk signing given his experience and small fee, whilst Lallana – who may miss the first couple of fixtures with a knee injury - was in the Premier League team of the year, so you can’t really ask for more of an indication of a ‘good buy’. Signed: Liverpool completed a deal to sign young Lille frontman Divock Origi on Tuesday . And while Dejan Lovren only has one season of Premier League experience, he adapted very well to its rigours, and played in the Champions League for previous clubs Lyon and Dinamo Zagreb. Many may see £20 million as a lot for Lovren, given he’s had just one season in the Premier League but you’re unlikely to get a top international defender for less these days and again, his experience in the Premier League means there will be little-to-no transition period. As for Can and Lazar Markovic, both are still unknown quantities but they are as much ‘for the future’ as they are first-team guarantees and all indications from pre-season are that both will grow to become superb players. All smiles: Dejan Lovren joined Liverpool in a £20million move from Southampton earlier this month . The transfer of Loic Remy obviously fell through amid suggestions the Frenchman failed a medical, which was a shame as he would have been snip at £8.5million. So, the Reds will continue looking elsewhere for a striker replacement for Luis Suarez, while at the same time Fabio Borini could still leave for Sunderland in a whopping £14million deal. All things considered, Liverpool’s business has so far been positive. No signings have yet got fans salivating with excitement, but should Brendan follow through on some of the reported interest in the likes of Karim Benzema, Isco or Marco Reus, then this could go down as Liverpool’s most fruitful summer in over a decade. Plan of action: Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers may still bring a huge name to Anfield this transfer window .","Liverpool are in the midst of 'doing a Spurs' according to some fans following the £75million departure of Luis Suarez to Barcelona .

"By . Daniel Miller . Kevin Wright, 49, is accused of stealing £250,000 from cancer charities he set up including one for his won son . A father stole hundreds of thousands of pounds from cancer charities - including one he set up to help his own son, a court heard. Kevin Wright, 49, set up countless charities which raised over £2 million but at least £250,000 of this was paid directly into his personal bank account, it was said. One of the funds was set up to help his son Bobby, who was diagnosed with cancer at the age of three in 2005, but he did not receive the treatment intended and instead Wright took his family on a £60,000 trip to Disneyland. Wright believed that he had 'carte Blanche to spend the money as he liked' and hundreds of thousands of pounds is still unaccounted for, the jury was told. He denies eight counts of fraud, 11 of theft and one count of converting criminal property at Nottingham Crown Court. His wife Jacqueline Wright also denies a count of converting criminal property. Nicholas Johnson QC said Wright exerted such a hold over his victims that they would even refuse NHS treatment at his request. 'He manipulated people, using their fears and sympathy, he was arrogant and calculating, taking great steps to cover his tracks,' he told the court. 'Some of the money may have gone to help poorly children, but some of the fundraising went straight into their personal accounts. 'Some was withdrawn [from the funds] in cash, as much as £50,000 in a single month was withdrawn, with no accounts to show where it went.' The jury of five men and seven women heard that Wright had approached parents of other sick children offering to help pay for their treatment at the private Memorial Sloane Kettering Cancer Centre (MSKCC) in New York. Mr Johnson said: 'But this was a hook, a way of getting people to part with their money. 'They sold lottery tickets, they called chances, had collection boxes and allowed donations from their website. 'In Mid December 2006 they made a deposit of $349,000 to the MSKCC, they had raised around $470,000. 'But he demanded a refund, receiving £166,000 in March 2007 and another £67,000 in April. 'Between July and August 2006 the fund paid for a trip to the Bahamas, while they were there they went to Disneyland in America. 'It cost about £60,000, he claimed this was for intensive treatment each day for five hours for six weeks. 'The crown say this was another abuse of a position of trust. 'Mr . Wright did provide some care to poorly children, but around £380,000 of . funds were deposited in his and his wife’s personal accounts between . April 2005 and March 2008. 'Around £250,000 of that came directly from the appeal funds.' Charges: Wright denies eight counts of fraud, 11 of theft and one count of converting criminal property at Nottingham Crown Court. His wife Jacqueline Wright (left) also denies a count of converting criminal property . But despite raising over £2million none of the children ever underwent treatment at the world-famous centre, the court heard. While raising money for Bobby’s Fund he was donated £30,000 each from two major charities, the Janet Nash fund and Caldwell Children, with the agreement that should the treatment not take place the money must be returned. Money continued to pour into the funds set up for Bobby until 2009 - two years after the Wrights had decided not to use the MSKCC treatment. Instead Wright splashed the £60,000 on a trip to the Bahamas and Disneyland, claiming that his son had undergone 'intensive' treatment every day of the trip. Around £500,000 worth of receipts and invoices were found at the family home in Tamworth, including around £38,000 which was released to spend on Wright’s restaurant, the Toad In The Hole, the court was told. Another £30,000 was spent on renovating a pub owned by Mr Wright’s girlfriend, £20,000 went to a friend who ran a used business, £4,000 was spent on cigarettes and alcohol and £33,000 on vehicle related expenses, it was said. Cash expenses totalled over £90,000. Around £700,000 was raised to help a boy . called Callum Kaye, who was born in 2002, but he only received . 'minimal' expenditure totalling around £13,000, the jury was told. Wright is accused of spending £60,000 on a trip to the Bahamas and Disneyland (pictured), falsely claiming that his son had undergone 'intensive' treatment every day of the trip . His family even flew for an appointment at MSKCC in New York but when they got there the clinic knew nothing about their arrival. Mr Johnson said: 'His [Callum’s] mother Anne Marie described Mr Wright as ‘slick’, he talked to them about alternative therapies such as eating organic food. 'He told her he was a millionaire and could help her to get Callum treatment. 'They signed an agreement to raise funds for treatment, the fundraising would claim they were raising funds for treatment MSKCC even if they didn’t as it was the best way to raise money. 'But Mr Wright refused to tell Anne Marie how much money had been raised, he made sure she remained isolated, told them not to come to fundraisers. 'He was controlling, when she asked about the money he told her Callum would probably be in the ground if it wasn’t for him. 'Around £700,000 was raised for Callum’s Fund in total. But what happened to that £700,000?' Police began investigating when Wright refused to tell Callum’s mother her how much money there was in the fund. Wright’s son Bobby has since recovered from cancer. The trial continues.

"By . Andrew Levy . Elaine McKay, 58, is accused of starting a sexual relationship with a 15-year-old boy while working at a school in Essex . A married teaching assistant groomed a pupil more than four decades her junior for sex, a court heard yesterday. Elaine McKay, 58, allegedly exposed herself to the 15-year-old boy over the video chat service Skype and sent him ‘compromising’ photographs of herself. A jury heard they ended up having sex at the teenager’s home after he took a shower and she pulled his towel off. The alleged illicit relationship is said to have ended when her victim – who cannot be named for legal reasons – secretly allowed friends to view her performing a sex act over her webcam. Rumours quickly began to circulate at Clacton Coastal Academy in Essex and then reached parents. Police arrested the mother of two, who has married three times and is understood to have two grandchildren. Richard Scott, prosecuting, yesterday said the defendant had breached her duty to ‘ensure the safekeeping and welfare of all children’. He added: ‘They had perfectly consensual sex. ‘The only problem was he was less than 16 at the time while she was in her late 50s. ‘Although he was near the age of consent he was not at the age of consent.’ The court heard McKay, who lives in Clacton, and the boy would regularly meet each other outside school and became closer over time. Among the photos that she allegedly sent the pupil were some of her topless. They were discovered when a friend borrowed the alleged victim’s phone to send a text to his girlfriend and stumbled across several explicit images on mobile messaging service WhatsApp. The friend later taunted the teenager, saying: ‘You’ve been a naughty boy.’ Describing the occasion that the pair allegedly had sex, Mr Scott said McKay called at the pupil’s house when no one else was there. He told the jury at Chelmsford Crown Court: ‘The date the intercourse took place was not absolutely certain, but what is clear is that it took place before he was 16. ‘The victim showered and went to the bedroom with the towel around him. Elaine McKay removed the towel … Afterwards, [she] made her excuses and said she needed to go.’ The court heard the boy sent her a message on one occasion saying ‘it isn’t right’. McKay is accused of sending the boy indecent pictures, which he stored on his phone and showed to his friends . When the teaching assistant was arrested on May 31 last year she gave police officers a statement saying: ‘I wholly deny ever having had sexual intercourse with the victim.’ After stories about their relationship began to emerge they are said to have exchanged messages in which they discussed getting their ‘story straight’. McKay, whose two daughters are in their 20s, denies two charges of sexual activity with a child. She is accused of starting a sexual relationship with the 15-year-old while working at the Clacton Coastal Academy in Essex . The first charge involves having sex with a boy aged 15. The second accuses the defendant of causing or inciting a boy to engage in sexual touching. She has admitted one charge of causing a child to look at an image of sexual activity, not reasonably believing he was aged 16 or over, for the purpose of obtaining sexual gratification. Clacton Coastal Academy is a 1,700-pupil co-education secondary school and sixth form that was rated as ‘requiring improvement’ in an Ofsted inspection last year. The trial continues.

"By . Katy Winter . When Lenny Walters informed his bank that his wife had been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, he discovered a horrifying secret: she had taken out two loans against their house, racking up £48,000 worth of debt. Joyce died six years ago, just months after Lenny found out about her betrayal. The widower from Pembrokeshire now faces losing his house to the bank and has delayed his retirement to stay on top of the debt. Tragically, he says that he can never forgive her. Scroll down for video . Lenny Walter appeared on ITV This Morning with his daughter Katy to talk about his devastating discovery . It was only when Lenny offered to take over the family finances after his wife was diagnosed with terminal cancer that he discovered the secret debt . Speaking on ITV’s This Morning with his daughter Katy, Lenny, 62, said: ‘It was six months after diagnosis that I discovered it, only because I said I was going to take over the finances because she wasn’t well. ‘I shouldn’t have said anything because then I wouldn’t have known anything about it until after she passed away. The day after I said I would take control of the finances she did a runner. ‘I only had said I would pay the bills and the next day she was gone because she knew I would find out.' ‘I found out that I was massively in debt by £48,000.' Lenny’s wife had taken out loans against the value of their home, redirecting mail from the bank to a resource centre where she worked to hide the issue from her husband. Her fraud involved her forging his signature twice to take out the loans. After her lies were discovered, Joyce fled the family home, moving in with her niece, miles away in Stanwell, Surrey. Lenny didn't see his wife again until he went to visit her in hospital on her death bed. Despite the huge amount of money spent, Lenny says he has no idea why Joyce needed it. Katy says she believes her mother's spending habits and Bingo playing created the debt . ‘I have no idea. We were solvent, we were both working. The kids had left home and we had a low mortgage, if any.’ However, daughter Katie suspects a combination of Bingo debts and overspending over years may have been to blame. ‘She had always been an over spender, she’d always buy two of everything. Because it had been that way for years you didn’t question it. ‘When she died she was living with me and I found loads of clothes with tags on that she hadn’t even worn. She just kept buying and buying.’ Despite receiving a letter of apology from Joyce  Lenny, who now faces losing his home, says he cannot forgive her . Lenny has battled with the bank for years in attempt to stay in the family home but faces losing it, and with it his children’s inheritance, in a forced sale to repay the debt. A month after Lenny, who works as a fisherman, discovered the financial problems he received a letter from Joyce, in which she wrote: ‘I know you must hate me, and who can blame you. You are a hard working man, loving and kind and a heart of gold, you made me a very happy woman and now I have left you because of money. 'This is all my fault not yours, I was spending far too much and it got out of control and I just didn’t know how to get out of it.’ But despite this apology and having been married for nearly 30 years, Lenny says that he still cannot forgive his wife, who died age 56. ‘I can’t forgive her intent, wanting to do that to me. If you’re married for 30 years  you don’t do that. That’s your best mate. ‘I gave her everything and she gave me everything - we had a good marriage.

Banks, who was in goal for England's 1966 triumph, is enjoying the recognition that his peers are getting in South America. The 76-year-old cited the improvements made by goalkeepers at this World Cup in comparison to four years ago in South Africa when many stuggled to deal with the much-maligned Jubulani football. Happy viewing: Gordon Banks has hailed the displays of goalkeepers at the World Cup . Safe hands: Tim Howard gained many plaudits for his goalkeeping performances for the USA in Brazil . Beaten away: Tim Krul proved Holland's quarter-final shootout hero against Costa Rica saving two penalties . ‘It has been a great World Cup for goalkeepers and it’s nice to see so many get recognition this year,' the Football Pools ambassador said. 'I don’t think the balls are moving round as much as they have done in recent tournaments so the keepers can save shots properly rather than just having to parry them. 'There have been some wonderful displays, Tim Howard who I have always rated highly, made over a dozen good saves versus Germany and there was the Mexican keeper [Guillermo] Ochoa who made a handful of saves against Brazil including one which was compared to my effort against Pele back in 1970.' Banks, who won 73 international caps for the Three Lions, also higlighted the performances of Julio Cesar and Tim Krul who have caught his eye. Cesar has started every game for Brazil despite falling behind club team-mate Rob Green in the QPR pecking order, while Krul proved Holland's hero in their quarter-final penalty shootout win against Costa Rica - coming on as an extra-time substitute before saving two spot-kicks. 'Brazil’s Julio Cesar, who is not even first choice for QPR has been playing very well and helped beat Chile on penalties in the last sixteen,' he added. 'Then there was Tim Krul’s performance for Holland versus Costa Rica. I have never seen anything like that – a keeper coming on for the shootout - but it clearly worked and whether it was mind games for the players when the substitution was made or when he was shouting at the penalty players before they took their kick, it worked!' All smiles: Julio Cesar has been one of Brazil's star performers in their run to the semi-finals of the World Cup .

"By . David Martosko . A Tennessee family of devout evangelical Christian asylum-seekers who face deportation to their native Germany has reached a milestone in their quest to remain in the United States, now that their petition on the White House's website collected more than 100,000 signatures in less than 30 days. That's the magic number that the Obama administration says will trigger an official review and a formal response. The total currently stands are more than 111,000. 'Every . state in the United States of America recognizes the right to . homeschool,' reads the petition filed by the Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA), 'and the U.S. has the world’s largest . and most vibrant homeschool community. Regrettably, this family faces . deportation in spite of the persecution they will suffer in Germany.' That group sued the Department of Justice after a judge in the DOJ's Executive Office for Immigration Review ruled that Uwe and Hannelore Romeike's earlier grant of asylum should be revoked. School day: The Romeikes have six children and another on the way. They are seen here demonstrating how homeschooling works in their Morristown, Tennessee home . Danger: Their native Germany does not allow children to be home-schooled and allows the revocation of custody in some cases . An estimated 2 million children in the US are home schooled, including the five out of six of the Romeikes' children who are school-age. Hannelore Romeike is pregnant and expecting her seventh child in June. But . the practice of teaching children at home instead of in government-run schools is illegal in Germany. An estimated 200 families teach . their own children there anyway, even at the risk of fines, criminal . prosecution and, in some cases, the loss of custody of their children. 'The public expects the White House to explain the inexplicable,' said the HSLDA's Michael Farris. 'In a season where the Administration has expressed leniency for millions of undocumented immigrants, we are baffled by the extreme attitudes toward this one German family.' Uwe Romeike appeared on the Mike Huckabee Show on the Fox News Channel, saying about the petition that 'the most important thing about this is that the government sees that not only are we interested in getting asylum, but the American people in general stand behind this case.' 'It’s all about freedom for parents to decide on their children’s education,' he said. Focus on the Romeikes: The family appeared on Mike Huckabee's Fox News program.

'Home schooling may be a good idea. It may be a bad idea. It's a public policy question,' Abraham said. 'Not having home schooling is not being persecuted. Asylum is about persecution.' 'They are not getting something they would like,' he insisted. ""that's true for people everywhere, and that's why we have legislatures.'

"By . Emine Sinmaz . After booking a table at their local pub for a traditional turkey lunch, the Chaplins thought they had taken all the stress out of Christmas. Until, that is, one family member’s car broke down on the way to the meal. Determined that husband Mark shouldn’t miss out on the £35 a head feast they had already paid for, Nina Chaplin asked pub staff to wrap up his meal so he could enjoy it later. Disgusted: Nina Chaplin and her daughter Abigail Chaplin with the £35-a-head dinner from The Cricketers pub in Rainham, Kent . Takeaway: The family asked for a dinner to be packaged and brought home after Mark Chaplin missed the meal due to a broken down car . But when she got home and opened the containers, she was shocked to discover what looked like ‘a ready meal that had simply been heated up in some way’. Inside one box, she described finding a sealed plastic bag with three pieces of soggy turkey that appeared to have been pre-packed. ‘It looked like something I could pick up from Iceland for £1.99,’ said the mother of four. ‘My husband was so upset he binned his meal and made himself a bacon sandwich instead – that was his Christmas dinner.’ Mrs Chaplin said she felt ripped off after paying almost £400 for the meal for 11 at The Cricketers in Rainham, Kent. She had decided to take her family out for Christmas lunch as a treat for her father, Bob Lander, 62. ‘This time of year is always hard for my dad because my mum died at Christmas some 13 years ago, so we always try to make it extra special for him,’ said Mrs Chaplin, 41. She booked a table at The Cricketers – part of the Greene King chain and her late mother’s favourite  pub – for a three-course lunch costing £35 each for adults and £17 each for children. But the dishes that were presented to the Chaplins were less than appetising. Feeling empty: Mrs Chaplin described the dinner as 'something I could pick up from Iceland for £1.99' and said her husband threw it in the bin . Pub: A group of 11 went to The Cricketers in Rainham, Kent for Christmas dinner, costing nearly £400. Mrs Chaplin said the turkey looked like 'compressed meat' ‘I looked at the turkey and it looked like compressed meat,’ said Mrs Chaplin, an IT worker from Rochester, Kent. ‘We all stared at our plates and were disgusted. We all realised that it wasn’t proper turkey that had been carved off the bone. It was like something frozen.’ The main course was served with four Brussels sprouts and six slices of carrots – and the family said the rest of the meal was no better. ‘Our starter – prawns on a stick – tasted like it had been defrosted in the microwave. It was warm on the outside and freezing cold on the inside,’ said Mrs Chaplin. ‘And the Christmas pudding was horrible and rubbery. We were expecting turkey and all the trimmings and we were told that we would have all-that-you-can-eat vegetables. ‘But we ended up with rubbish. When you pay £35 for Christmas dinner, you rightfully expect more. It was pitiful.’ Unappetising: Menus at The Cricketers pub in Rainham, Kent, advertising their £35-a-head menu . She said she was most disappointed for her father, who suffers from emphysema and had saved up his pension money to pay for his meal. ‘My dad was upset because it cost so much money,’ she said. ‘I felt gutted. It ruined our family Christmas.’ A spokesman for Greene King  said last night: ‘While not cut from the bone in the pub, unlike in our carveries, our meat is from quality British turkeys and all of our vegetables are fresh. ‘Usually we would not provide takeaway Christmas dinners but our team was keen that the customer’s husband did not completely miss out on his Christmas meal and did their level best to help.’","Chaplin family paid nearly £400 for dinner at The Cricketers pub .

"By . Alasdair Glennie Tv Correspondent . The BBC launched a sweeping investigation into Top Gear after its presenter Jeremy Clarkson was accused of racism, it has emerged. The inquiry was triggered after the 54-year-old was embroiled in a series of race rows, culminating in his grovelling apology for apparently using the word n***** during an outtake. Following the incident in May, Clarkson was handed a final warning but escaped the sack. However to avoid future embarrassments, TV controller Danny Cohen reportedly ordered a review of the show’s culture and practices. Investigation: The BBC has launched a probe into Top Gear after a string of controversies. The show's presenters built a bridge over the River Kwai in Thailand during a series finale and Clarkson commented that there was a 'slope' on it - just as a man of Asian descent walked towards them . The three hosts, pictured during the Burma special which sparked the controversy . Although the BBC has refused to . release the findings of the investigation, which began in June and took . between four and six weeks, it is understood that all Top Gear staff . were asked for their views on whether the hit show is racist. They . were also asked whether they felt afraid to speak out to their superiors . when they felt parts of the programme were offensive. And . investigators interviewed Clarkson and his co-presenters James May and . Richard Hammond as well as Top Gear’s executive producer Andy Wilman. The stars of the show were reportedly reminded of their . ‘responsibilities as BBC employees’. Clarkson was forced to deny allegations that he was caught on camera using the n-word during filming of the hit BBC series . After the inquiry was completed . last month, Mr Cohen met with production bosses to discuss the issues . raised in the report. It is understood that he wanted to launch . disciplinary action against Clarkson, but was blocked by BBC . director-general Lord Hall. The latest race row in May was sparked . when unused footage from Top Gear emerged showing the £1million a year . host swinging his finger between two cars while reciting a notoriously . racist children’s nursery rhyme. In the clip, he could be heard . chanting: ‘Eeny, meeny, miny, moe’ before apparently mumbling ‘Catch a . n***** by his toe’. Clarkson initially denied he used the word, but . later issued a humiliating video message in which he said he was . ‘mortified’ by the upset he had caused, and ‘begged forgiveness’ of his . fans. Yesterday the BBC refused to comment, but this was just the . latest in a long line of controversies involving the outspoken star. Last . week, broadcasting regulator Ofcom found he ‘deliberately’ used racist . language during an episode filmed in Burma which was screened in March. He . caused outrage when he said a bridge with an Asian man walking across . it had a ‘slope on it’. Producers apologised but said it was . ‘light-hearted wordplay’ and claimed he did not know the term was . offensive. Clarkson provoked more fury in April by naming his black . terrier Didier Dogba after Ivory Coast footballer Didier Drogba. In . 2012, the presenter compared synchronised swimming to the deaths of 23 . Chinese cockle pickers in Morecambe Bay in 2004, and provoked a flood of . complaints in 2011 when he said his new TV’s energy-saving setting made . it seem as if programmes were being ‘presented by Lenny Henry in a . cave’. The BBC also had to apologise after Clarkson and his co-hosts . cracked offensive jokes about Mexicans, prompting an official complaint . by the Mexican ambassador. And another 31,000 viewers complained when . he joked that striking public sector workers should be ‘executed in . front of their families’. That was not the first - or last time - that Jeremy Clarkson has sparked controversy with some of his comments. Weeks later, in unaired footage of the series, the 54-year-old presenter was heard reciting the rhyme 'eeny, meeny, miny, mo' before apparently muttering 'catch a n***** by his toe'. It took place during filming of the third episode of Top Gear series 19 as the star reviewed the £25,000 Toyota GT86 and the Subaru BRZ - which costs around the same amount. Clarkson became embroiled in a second race row, just weeks after the 'slope' controversy . Telling viewers that they may find it difficult to differentiate between the two vehicles he demonstrated how to do it using the child's counting rhyme. After initially denying the claims, Clarkson 'begged' for forgiveness, saying he 'did everything in [his] power to not use that word', but that his 'efforts weren't quite good enough.' Jeremy Clarkson was also accused of racism for naming his black West Highland terrier dog Didier Dogba after former Chelsea star Didier Drogba, who is from the Ivory Coast. Clarkson, who often mocks political correctness, asked: 'Why is it racist to name our amazingly brilliant dog after a footballer?' In December 2011, the controversial host came under under fire for suggesting public sector strikers 'be shot in front of their families'. Weeks later, he provoked a fresh storm of protest after describing people who kill themselves by jumping under trains as 'selfish'. In his newspaper column in The Sun, Clarkson wrote that 'foxy woxy and the birds' should be left to 'nibble' at the 'gooey parts' of people who die by jumping in front of trains.","BBC reportedly launched probe following racism controversies .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The world's first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier has been retired from active service in the U.S. Navy having served longer than any other U.S. aircraft carrier. At 1,123 ft, the ‘Big E’ was the longest naval vessel in the world, she weighed 94,781 tonnes and was home to a crew of some 4,600 people. When she was first built in the early 1960s, the Enterprise was meant to be the first of a class of six, but construction costs ballooned and the remaining vessels were never laid down.

The crew of the USS Enterprise stands at attention after disembarking the ship during the inactivation ceremony . Enterprise is the second oldest commissioned vessel in the United States Navy, after the wooden-hulled, three-masted frigate USS Constitution. The USS Enterprise (CVN-65), the eighth United States naval vessel to bear the name. She was originally scheduled for decommissioning in 2014 or 2015, depending on the life of her reactors and completion of her replacement, USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78). Her final deployment, the last before her decommissioning, began on 10 March 2012 and ended 4 November 2012. Enterprise is the only aircraft carrier to house more than two nuclear reactors. She is also the only carrier with four rudders, two more than other classes, and features a more cruiser-like hull. The USS Enterprise ended its notable 51-year career on Saturday during a ceremony at Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia. Thousands of former crew members, ship builders and their families lined a pier to bid farewell to one of the most decorated ships in the Navy. Chief of Naval Operations, Adm. Jonathan Greenert, addresses the media during the ceremony for the ship that had served in the fleet for 51 years .

Greenert addresses the audience during the Inactivation Ceremony . The aircraft carrier USS Enterprise is the only carrier with four rudders, two more than other classes, and features a more cruiser-like hull . The ship had served in every major conflict since participating in a blockade during the Cuban Missile Crisis. In October 1962, following revelations that the Soviet Union was constructing nuclear missile launch sites on Cuba, President John F. Kennedy ordered the United States Department of Defense to conduct a large-scale buildup. President Kennedy ordered a naval and air blockade on shipment of offensive military equipment to Cuba, and demanded the Soviets dismantle the missile sites there. Four United States Second Fleet carriers participated in the blockade - Enterprise (as part of Task Force 135), Independence, Essex, and Randolph, backed by shore-based aircraft. By 28 October, the crisis was averted, after the US secretly agreed to remove nuclear missiles from Italy and Turkey. Missile crisis: President John. F.

With the inactivation, the U.S. fleet is temporarily reduced to 10 aircraft carriers while the USS Gerald R. Ford is built. It will join the fleet in 2015. The Enterprise was a principal setting of the Tom Cruise 1986 blockbuster Top Gun. Director Tony Scott filmed actual flight operations aboard ship and incorporated them into the film's plot. Also in 1986, Enterprise was a setting of scenes in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home. The ship was unavailable for filming, so scenes depicting Enterprise were again filmed aboard USS Ranger. More important for Star Trek lore, the world's first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier was the inspiration for the naming of the Starship USS Enterprise (NCC-1701). 80's movies including Star Trek 4 and Top Gun featured the Enterprise .","The USS Enterprise has served longer than any other U.S. aircraft carrier .

The heartbreaking moment war zone veteran Christopher Gunness collapsed into uncontrollable tears came after an Israeli attack on a school based inside a refuge camp in North Gaza. Around 20 men, women and children were killed and more than 100 civilians were injured. An Al Jazeera interview with Mr Gunness was cut short as he became visibly distressed. Scroll down for video . UN official Christopher Gunness broke down during an interview with Al Jazeera on Wednesday . Mr Gunness is the senior director for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East. The war veteran lost his composure as he said 'the rights of Palestinians and even their children are denied and it's appalling' He attempted to clear his throat and took a deep breath to try and regain his composure but soon began sobbing out loud. He managed to utter the words 'my pleasure' before a colleague rushed over to comfort him. The camera panned away from him as he wailed and the colleague tried to reassure him 'it's OK'. The victims of the Jabalia Elementary Girls School attack in the Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza, who had fled their homes after warnings from Israel's military and were sheltering in the school, were killed on Wednesday morning when two classrooms were destroyed. Mr Gunness, the senior director for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, told Aljezeera 'the rights of Palestinians and even their children are denied and it's appalling'.

Last night, in a rare criticism of Israel’s actions in the Gaza Strip, the White House said it was ‘extremely concerned’ that thousands of Palestinians were not safe even in UN-designated shelters. Spokesman Bernadette Meehan said: ‘This violence underscores the need to achieve a ceasefire as soon as possible.’ Later on Wednesday, 15 Palestinians were killed and 160 wounded in an Israeli air strike which blew apart a busy market in Shejaiya. The air strike happened during a four-hour ceasefire, which Israel later claimed applied only to areas where its soldiers were not already operating. Speaking about the warnings that the school was being used as a shelter, Pierre Krahenbuhl, head of the United Nations Relief And Works Agency (UNRWA), said the last notification was given just hours before the pre-dawn attack. ‘I condemn in the strongest possible terms this serious violation of international law by Israeli forces,’ he said last night.

The front wall of the classroom was blown out, leaving debris and bloodied clothing all over the floor . Israel claimed that mortar shells had been fired from near the school, and that its soldiers fired back. ‘Five Israeli tank shells struck the people and killed many of them as they slept,’ added Khalil al-Halabi, director of UNRWA’s northern Gaza operations. ‘Those people came to the school because it is a designated UN shelter.’ Assad Sabah said he and his five children were huddling under desks in one of the classrooms because of the constant sound of tank fire throughout the night. ‘We were scared to death,’ he said. ‘After 4.30am, tanks started firing more. Three explosions shook the school. One classroom collapsed over the head of the people who were inside.’ The front wall of the classroom was blown out, leaving debris and bloodied clothing. Another strike tore a large hole in the ceiling of a second-floor classroom. At the edge of the schoolyard, some 20 donkeys lay dead, still tied to railings.

The money will provide emergency food for more than 300,000 people for one month and brings to £10million the amount released to help Gaza since the crisis began. International Development Secretary Justine Greening said: ‘After more than three weeks, the death toll in Gaza is rising and more than 200,000 people, many of them children, have been displaced from their homes.

Having won bronze in 2006 and bagged silver in Delhi four years ago, the 28-year-old completed the Commonwealth set on a sunny night at Hampden Park.

Neither managed to clear 5.60m in their three allotted leaps, so the gold was decided with a jump-off.

"By . Rachel Reilly . Babies will be born deaf and blind unless they are given the MMR jab, a leading expert has warned. Professor Colin Blakemore said the measles epidemic that has centred in South Wales is just one part of a much wider problem that could lead to disabling and even life-threatening outbreaks of mumps and rubella. The reluctance to immunise babies came about in 1998 after a scientific paper was published by Andrew Wakefield in The Lancet. It claimed that children who had the combined vaccine were at a greater risk of developing autism and colitis. Unvaccinated teenagers are putting their future children at risk of catching mumps and rubella which could leave them blind, deaf and with heart problems . Rates of immunisation plummeted after the article and although numbers have risen steadily since the study was discredited, more than 300,000 British children aged between 10 and 16 remain unvaccinated. A further 300,000 have only had one of the recommended two doses of the vaccine. Professor Blakemore,  the former chief executive of the Medical Research Council, wrote in The Times that children who missed out on the jab are now teenagers and that many will soon become pregnant. He explained that mumps can render young men infertile and added that women infected with rubella have a 20 per cent chance of abortion. A large number of babies who survive will suffer with permanent deafness, blindness and heart problems associated with rubella syndrome. Pregnant women with rubella (pictured) have a 20 per cent chance of abortion . 'We might think that the measles epidemic is the last gasp of Mr Wakefield. But I fear he still has more damage to wreak,' Professor Blakemore said. He added that people were in danger of forgetting the 'miraculous' powers of vaccines because immunising causes us to forget quite how dangerous infections disease are. Rubella numbers have risen in recent years. Last year there were 65 cases in England alone - the highest number for over a decade. Jof McGill of deaf blind charity Sense added that people who were born deaf and blind in the 1950s and 1960s still require long-term care. He said: 'A baby born affected by rubella is said to have congenital rubella syndrome. Many will have hearing loss, cataracts, other eye conditions, heart problems requiring significant hospital treatment and ongoing health concerns that affect a person throughout their lives. 'You can't wait for an outbreak and then react. The only want to to protect women is to stop the disease [with universal immunisation].' Dr Ralph Holme, Action on Hearing Loss Head of Biomedical Research, added that congenital rubella syndrome could have social consequences too: ‘It is really important that people take up the MMR vaccine, which offers protection against rubella. 'Although not life-threatening, hearing loss has significant personal and social costs and can lead to high levels of social isolation, with research also showing people with severe and profound levels of deafness being four times more likely to be unemployed than the general population.'","Professor Colin Blakemore has urged teenagers to get vaccinated to prevent wave of mumps and rubella .

"By . Hugo Duncan . Hitler: Plundered gold after Czech invasion . The Bank of England helped the Nazis sell gold plundered from the invasion of Czechoslovakia, newly-released documents revealed yesterday. It is feared the bullion worth  £5.6million – or £300million today – may have been used to finance Hitler’s war machine. Archives show that the bullion, held in the Bank’s vaults, was sold to the national banks of Belgium and Holland and buyers here. ‘At the outbreak of war and for some time afterwards the Czech gold incident still rankled,’ the online documents state. The Bank of England helped sell a further £860,000 of Nazi gold in June 1939 – without waiting for approval. But the Government halted all transactions on the outbreak of the Second World War. It is also believed the Bank of England still holds some ingots of the gold with a swastika stamped on them. The sales have weighed on the reputation of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) – the central bankers’ bank which ordered the sale. But less has been known about the Bank of England’s role under then governor Sir Montagu Norman. The papers said: ‘The Bank of England referred the matter to the Chancellor, who said that he would like the opinion of the law officers of the Crown. ‘On the BIS enquiring, however, what was causing the delay and saying that inconvenience would be caused because of payments the next day, the Bank of England acted on the instructions referring to the law officers, who, however, subsequently upheld their action.’ The sale of gold looted by the Nazis after their invasion of Czechoslovakia has long been seen as one of the darkest episodes in central banking history. At the time, the Bank of England held the chair of the Swiss-based BIS and stored much of the gold held by other countries in its vaults. Documents show the UK central bank felt it ought to do as the BIS instructed even as the British government attempted to freeze the sale of stolen Czech assets. The Bank of England helped the Nazis sell gold plundered from the invasion of Czechoslovakia . The independence of the BIS – set up in 1930 to organise German reparation payments after the First World War  – was seen as paramount particularly as the world was not yet at war. The documents show that it was considered ‘wrong and dangerous’ for the future of BIS for the UK central bank to ‘attempt for political reasons to influence decisions of the president of the BIS’ by blocking any transactions. But just months later, the UK government . declared war on Germany following the Nazi invasion of Poland, and the . position changed. In orders to the Bank, the Chancellor said: ‘The Bank should not act upon an order of the Bank for International Settlements if it seems to the Bank to be likely that the order might benefit the enemy.’ Academics have long believed that the Bank of England, under Sir Montagu, bent over backwards to help the Nazi war machine. In the summer of 1942 President Roosevelt sent a report on his activities to Sir Winston Churchill. According to documents filed in Birmingham University, Churchill asked Anthony Eden, his Secretary for War, to look into the concerns. The Bank of England still holds gold for countries all over the world – with £210billion of bullion in its coffers. Large amounts of British Government gold are held at Fort Knox in the United States.","Bank of England helped Nazis sell gold looted from Czechoslovakia .

A former band teacher charged with molesting his 14-year-old student died the day before his plea hearing. James Nolan Owens, 29, was found dead in his Lee's Summit, Missouri home on July 31, just five days ahead of his trial. A plea hearing usually signifies the defendant is planning to plead guilty, according to The Kansas City Star. The married man was charged in August 2012 with child enticement and second-degree child molestation. According to court documents, Owens was arrested and charged after a woman intercepted a Facebook chat between him and a student at Missouri's William Chrisman High School in August 2012. The student allegedly confessed to a school counselor that Owens had inappropriately touched and kissed her for at least five months, sometimes at school. Investigators said they found past Facebook chats that contained sexually-explicit messages from Owens. Detectives said the pair had exchanged more than 100 phone calls and about 1,520 text messages over two months in 2012. Cops also found topless photos of the student on his computer and phone, according to court documents. Lee’s Summit police responded to Owens’ home on a death investigation call about 1pm on July 30.

"By . Steve Robson . Most parents like to boast about their children's talents, but you might think Pam Billington would keep her family's special abilities to herself. The 38-year-old is convinced her two youngest Jadon 10, and Lucy, eight, can talk to dead people. Mrs Billington, from Cheshire, says they have made friends with more than ten spirits - including their own grandmother - in the past year. Scroll down for video... Hidden talent: Mother Pam Billington, right, says two of her children - Lucy, left, and Jadon, centre, can talk to ghosts. Emily, second from the right, has not been blessed with the gift . Haunted house: The attic where the Billington children claim to have talked to spirits . She says the children talk about their new friends so much it feels as if they're part of the family. 'It all started a couple of years ago when Jadon told me he had been visited by an angel in the night,' Mrs Billington said. 'At first I dismissed it as being the product of an overactive imagination. But when Lucy started talking about it too I started to listen. 'It's a gift and you either have it or you don't. It isn't a hoax, I really believe my kids can talk to spirits.' The spirit visits began in 2011 at the family's former home in Manchester where, according to the children, the ghosts lived among them and even in their attic. In March this year, the family moved to a new home in Sandbach, Cheshire, but the children claim the ghosts relocated too. Mrs Billington, a full-time mother, says she became a believer after experiencing a strange encounter of her own. She said: 'One night I was watching TV and I said to Jadon if they are really here now ask one of them to tug at my trouser leg. 'Jadon asked, then a few seconds later I felt something prod my leg and I saw with my own eyes my trousers move. Delighted: Mother Pam Billington says she 'really believes' her children can talk to ghosts . Ghoulish friends: The communication began when Jadon, right, said he had been visited by an angel in the night . 'It's incredible. Now, they touch me all the time. They'll poke me in the arm and touch me on the leg. I've even been poked in the eye by a ghost. 'They also made the television go fuzzy when Jadon asked one to prove that he was there. 'You have to experience it to understand. I've always read things but I didn't have a true appreciation of it until I went through it with my children.' She added: 'I love having spirits in the house, I think it's great. 'I think it shows that anything's possible and it gives me hope for when I pass away. I know that this is not the end and we carry on.' As an atheist, Mrs Billington says she didn't raise her children to believe in ghosts and has not nurtured their psychic ability in any way. But the children, who are home-schooled, are convinced. Among the ghostly guests are an American couple called Sam and Simon Crease, who Jadon talks to, along with an angel called Michael. Lucy has formed a bond with a young girl called Rose. And, at her new home in Cheshire, she . says she has seen a ghostly woman in a neighbouring garden, believed to . be the spirit of an old woman who recently passed away there. Jadon said: 'I used to have trouble sleeping because I always felt like someone was watching me. 'I would wake up in the night and run into mum and dad's room. 'Now when I see spirits I talk to them - and they talk back. I see them during the day and night.' He added: 'Mum and dad asked me if I was making this up and I'm not - there really are ghosts in the house.' Believers: Mrs Billington, who home schools the children, says she has done nothing to encourage their psychic ability . Selected few: Eldest child Emily, centre, hasn't encountered the ghosts but says she would 'freak out' if she did . Although Lucy is used to her ghostly friends she admitted she still got 'freaked' out by their late-night antics. She said: 'I used to get scared. When I first saw them I didn't know whether it was a spirit or my imagination. 'Now I see lots of them not and I'm used to it.' While Pam is convinced her children have a special gift, Daron, who was raised as a Jehovah's Witness, is still skeptical. The 40-year-old health and safety advisor said he had never experienced a ghostly encounter of his own. He added: 'I was raised in a religion that is definitely against things like spirits. 'I am still a little bit cautious with my children when we talk about ghosts but they seem okay and it keeps them happy so I leave them to it. 'I reacted with disbelief at first and a few times I thought they were based on imaginary friends. 'But the children went in to so much detail when they were talking about them that as time went by I started accepting it.' He added: 'I'm still not really 100 per cent convinced but I think there's a little bit of truth in it. 'My kids aren't liars and if you listen to how they speak they tend to be quite believable.' Pam and Daron's eldest, Emily, is the only child in the house not to have picked up a talent for talking with ghosts and has not seen any spooky goings on. She added: 'I don't mind them but I haven't seen them. If I did I think I would freak out.'","Pam Billington, 38, believes Jadon, 10, and Lucy, eight, have 'a gift'

"By . Associated Press . and MailOnline Reporter . It was an inscription which confounded Illinois librarians for years. On the inside cover of a 'scientific' book justifying racism was a note believed to be penned by the US President who ended slavery, Abraham Lincoln. Now historians have confirmed the Great Emancipator read 'Types of Mankind' and authored the message around 1861, the year he was inaugurated as president, to better educate himself about his opponents' line of thinking. Racist tome: Historians have confirmed Abraham Lincoln's handwriting inside a tattered book, 'Types of Mankind', justifying racism that he may have read to better understand his opponents' thinking on slavery . Abraham Lincoln wrote:  'C. H. Moore, EsqClintonDe Witt CoIlls.'Beneath that is a handwritten attestation by attorney Lawrence Weldon:'The above was written by Prest Lincolnin 1861 - Just before he left forWashington. L Weldon.' 'There are certain letters of the . alphabet that Lincoln wrote in a way that were not common to his era,' Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum Curator James . Cornelius said, referencing Lincoln's style of writing E's and N's. 'A . forger can typically do some of the letters in a good Lincolnian way. They'll give themselves away on a couple of the others. This all adds . up.' The 700-page book, published in 1854, extolled the 'scientific' theory that different races were created at different times and thus could not be equal. Popular among racists and slave owners during the Civil War era, the book argued it was part of the natural order that white people would enslave Africans and Native Americans. Librarians at Vespasian Warner Public Library in Clinton, Illinois, where the book was held, had long known of rumors that the handwriting was Lincoln's but never checked its authenticity. The note said: 'C.H. Moore Esq, Clinton, De Witt Co, Ills.' Underneath that was an attestation by another writer. 'We didn't know whether we should take it seriously,' the library's assistant director Bobbi Perryman said. Lincoln rarely wrote in books, according to historians, and this note didn't bear a recognizable signature. Historians have confirmed that Abraham Lincoln (right) wrote a note inside racist book 'Types of Mankind' (left) in 1861 . According to Pantagram, Lincoln had borrowed the book from attorney Clifton H. Moore, his friend. Lincoln allegedly wrote the note in 1861 so the book would be returned to Moore, its rightful owner. Pantagram theorized that Moore lent Lincoln the book to assist Lincoln with a legal case. Lincoln reportedly had a client at DeWitt County, Bill Dungey, whose brother-in-law called him 'a negro' and 'Black Bill' to people in town because of his dark skin. Dungey explained that he was part Portuguese and sued for libel because being classed as a black man would undermine his marriage to the accuser's sister. Lincoln won the case.

The Port Adelaide Football Club launched a campaign to find Gavin Wanganeen's premiership guernsey which was stolen from his bag after the 2004 final . He believes it was stolen from his bag and Wanganeen has not seen the jersey since. Wanganeen retired in 2006 but has remained connected to the club as a mentor and Aboriginal program ambassador and the club launched a campaign to find his grand final jumper in time for the tenth anniversary of the premiership win. The club received an anonymous tip-off from someone claiming to have the jersey who said he would return it after the Adelaide Power's Round 17 match against Richmond on July 13. After the match assistant coach Josh Carr collected the guernsey from the person, who wished to remain anonymous and did not say how they came to possess it. In order to surprise Wanganeen, the club organised for him to speak to the club's current playing group. After his presentation, Kane Cornes, one of Wanganeen's 2004 premiership teammates presented him with jersey. The last time Wanganeen saw his grand final jumper was when he took it off to take a shower after the grand final in 2004 . Wanganeen was shocked to see his football jumper again, saying: 'Are you serious? Is this the real deal? Bull***t!' 'It's an amazing feeling to be able to get this jumper back,' said an emotional Wanganeen. 'I haven't seen it in 10 years since I last took it off after the grand final and jumped into the shower. I remember putting into my bag – that was the last time I saw it until 10 minutes ago when I was lucky enough to lay my eyes on it again. 'It's an amazing feeling, I'd pretty much given up and was resigned to the fact that I'd never see it again,' he said. Wanganeen said he was delighted the jersey would be able to stay in the family. 'I'll be able to hand it down to my son, Tex,' he said. 'I can get it framed now, put it on the wall somewhere and regularly look at it and be reminded of that great day in 2004 when our great Port Adelaide footy club won our first premiership in the AFL.'","Gavin Wanganeen helped the Port Adelaide Power to win its first premiership in 2004 .

"By . Kate Lyons . Australian women lose almost a quarter of their incomes after separating from their husbands, whereas men's incomes remain virtually unchanged, says a new government report. A report for the Australian Institute of Family Studies found the household income of Australian women dropped by 21 percent in the year following a separation, whereas men's incomes dropped only one percent in the year after divorcing. The study, which tracked the incomes of 15,000 Australians over ten years, found that while the incomes of separated women recovered somewhat over a longer period, six years after separating, the household income for separated women was still 12 percent lower than the incomes of non-separated women, after the numbers were adjusted for the number of household members. A year after separating, Australian women have a 21 percent drop in income, according to a new government report . Co-researcher Professor Matthew Gray from the Australian National University said the figures were the result of a combination of factors, but largely stemmed from the fact that women often took time off work to raise children and bore the brunt of child-rearing costs after separation. 'Women will be less likely to be working, or more likely to be working part-time. Then while there might be child support paid it's not normally that big,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'For men, their household income will go down, because often their partner is working, but they’re in a household of one person and while they will pay child support, that's nothing like the financial contribution they would have made if they were living in a household [with the children].' The findings come as researchers predict that within a generation the majority of homeless people in Sydney will be single women over the age of 50 who do not have any of the issues that often lead to homelessness, such as mental health problems or addiction, but face poverty and homelessness due to unequal wages, the financial impact of divorce and child-rearing costs. Women often take time off work or work part-time because of children and so find themselves in a more precarious financial situation . The government study, released today, also compared the effect of divorce on income of people in the UK, the U.S., Germany, Korea and Switzerland, and revealed that Australian divorced couples fared relatively well compared to their overseas counterparts. Six years after separation the income of divorced women was significantly lower than non-divorced women. In the U.S. there was a 37 percent loss of income for women after separation, in Germany the loss was 23 percent and in Britain it was 17 percent. Though they still lost 12 percent of their incomes, Australian women fared better than women in all other countries studied except Switzerland, where there was no evidence of any real impact of separation on women’s incomes. Australian women fared better than women in all other countries studied, except for Switzerland, where there was no evidence of any real impact of separation on women¿s incomes . The relatively strong financial position Australian women found themselves in was credited by the researchers to increased workforce participation, government income support, child support and high levels of re-partnering. In the U.S., where women fared the worst after separating, the large financial cost was linked to low levels of government support, low minimum wages and modest rates of re-partnering. The blow to men’s incomes six years after separating was also measured by the study. While Australian men saw no change and Swiss men were financially better off after separating, men in Britain, the U.S. and Germany were substantially worse off than non-separated men, earning 18 percent less in Britain, 13 percent less in Germany and 11 percent less in the U.S. than partnered men.","A government report found that women suffer a dramatic loss of earnings one year after separating .

"By . Kate Lyons . A new doll, which depicts an anatomically correct baby boy complete with penis and testicles, has divided Australian parents with some claiming it is inappropriate. The You & Me Mommy Change My Diaper doll, sold by Toys ""R"" Us, makes slurping sounds when he is fed through his bottle and cries when he wets his nappy, only stopping when he is changed. But it is the realistic depiction of his genitals that has parents up in arms and it seems that parents are divided roughly along gendered lines, with fathers strongly objecting to the doll, while mothers have no problem with it. Angry: You & Me Mommy Change My Diaper Doll from Toys ""R"" Us has some parents frowning . A post about the doll on an online mother's group generated more than 300 comments in less than 24 hours. In the original post, Bree Minster shared a picture of the doll, with the caption: 'I just showed my partner this doll and asked him if he would let our daughter play with it. He says no. What do your partners think?' Overwhelming the mothers were in favour of the doll, describing it as 'natural' and long overdue, whereas many women said their partners objected to the doll. 'I just showed my partner he said no way [our daughter] doesn't need to know about boys until she is 30,' wrote Anita Good. 'I just asked hubby and his reply was NO!! I said ""why?"" and he said ""because it's f***ing gross!!""' wrote Simmone Taylor. The original doll (left) to wet itself like a real baby is Besty Wetsy invented in 1935 and the new anatomically correct modern version (right) One woman said her partner blamed doll such as this one for the premature sexualisation of children. 'My partner said it's not necessary! No need to have a little girl touching a doll willy. He thinks that's why so many young kids are sexually active younger these days because parents let their children ""see more"".' Dr Joanne Orlando from the School of Education at the University of Western Sydney says those fears are almost certainly unfounded. Would you let your child play with this anatomically correct doll? 'The counter-argument that girls will interact with these dolls in a sexual way is a pretty weak argument, we don't have any research to support that, unless they're in an environment where an adult is interacting with it in a sexual way,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'Gender is a normal part of life, anatomically different parts of our body are a normal part of life, and children learn that from a very early age, we're not telling them something they don't know already.' And as one mother wrote, this is not the first anatomically correct male doll to cause controversy. 'I had… the boy baby born growing up and my uncle didn't agree so he cut its doodle off. My kids both have one [and] I'm fully okay with it,' wrote Jeanette Marie Simpson-Smith on the online forum. The first anatomically correct male doll, the Archie Bunker's Grandson Joey Stivic doll, was created in 1976 and is still available for purchase on eBay. The first doll to wet its nappy was the Betsy Wetsy doll, created in the 1930s.","The You & Me Mommy Change My Diaper Doll is sold at Toys ""R"" Us .

"By . Kate Lyons . The brother of an Australian boxer has been ordered to pay a $730 fine for hitting a seven-year-old boy with a plastic bottle after he lost his temper during one of his brother's bouts at the Commonwealth Games. Perth man Laith Samardali, 25 was ordered to pay the fine by the Glasgow Sherriff Court yesterday after he caused a commotion in the stands fight on Tuesday night, when his brother Jordan Samardali's fight was stopped 39 seconds into the first round. Samardali became angry when the bout was stopped and another man in the crowd told him to watch his language because there were children watching. Laith Samardali, the brother of Australian boxer Jordan Samardali, leaves Glasgow Sheriff Court with after he was ordered to pay $730 compensation for hitting a seven-year-old boy with a plastic bottle during his brother's boxing match . At this point Samardali threw a plastic bottle at the man, which missed him and hit a seven-year-old boy causing him to cry, the court heard. Samardali pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and acting in a threatening and abusive manner. Glasgow Sheriff Norman Ritchie ordered him to pay $365 compensation each to the man and the boy. Mr Ritchie told Laith Samardali that his behaviour was 'abusive' and had ruined the boy's experience of the Commonwealth Games. 'The little boy was attending an event in the city that should have filled him with long lasting pleasant memories. Now he will have the recollection of a bad man shouting and swearing and throwing a bottle at him,' the Sydney Morning Herald reported him as saying. Samardali intends to return to Australia over the weekend.

"By . Kate Lyons . When Kelly and Corey, a young couple from Dee Why in Sydney's northern beaches, missed out on a property at auction on Saturday, Kelly broke down. 'It was hugely disappointing,' said Matt Hunt, the real estate agent selling the property who has been trying to help the couple find a house for the last two years. Mr Hunt said the home was 'an entry-level home' in North Narrabeen, and sold for just $1,000 more than Kelly and Corey could afford. Scroll down for video . Kelly and Corey, a young Sydney couple, had been searching for a house to buy for two years when they narrowly missed out on this North Narrabeen property . 'They left the auction here in tears. She was upset, they started walking out and Corey was rubbing her back, she was rubbing her eyes,' Mr Hunt told Daily Mail Australia. Kelly and Corey, who have not been able to find a property in two years, represent a generation of first-home buyers struggling to make their way into an increasingly difficult Australian property market. 'We are seeing a lot of disappointment,' said Mr Hunt. A Senate Inquiry into Affordable Housing, taking place tomorrow in Canberra, is investigating the difficulties presented by the conditions of the current property market. In November 2013, the proportion of first-home buyers purchasing property dipped to the lowest historical level, with only 12.3 percent of all owner-occupied properties bought by first-time buyers. The drop was most pronounced in New South Wales, where the proportion of first-home buyers dropped from 19.2 percent in 2011 to 7.5 percent in 2013. Average loan sizes taken out by first home buyers has increased 3.2 percent in the last year, to $302,233, according to the most recent data from the Real Estate Institute Australia's Housing Affordability Report. Mat and Lexi Hill have been searching for a house since last September and are considering long-term renting because of the high house prices . Mr and Ms Hill attended an auction on Saturday in Sydney's west that was attended by 30 registered bidders and went for more than $300,000 above the advertised price . Lexi and Mat Hill, both 29, have been looking to purchase their first home in Sydney since last September and because of the steep prices, are now facing the prospect of renting long-term, until house prices drop. 'We're looking in suburbs that are or should be affordable,' Ms Hill told Daily Mail Australia. 'We're looking out west, we're not looking in the inner west or the eastern suburbs.' 'Be big and bold, get in early. There's no benefit to holding back at all, some people think it's best to bid on the second hammer and frustrate the other buyers, but the winning formula seems to be the people who get in early,' said Matt Hunt from First National Rod Jones. 'Things will get to the point where the bids go up by $500 and $1,000. People won't continue to keep going if they think they're up against a strong contender. 'Sort out a budget and leave a buffer zone. Buyers are going to have a number they think [the property] is worthy, they should always have a five percent buffer zone if they can afford it. 'Nothing in this market is going to go at a discounted rate. What you feel is market value is where you should come in [with your first bid]… Coming in at market value can throw off the other buyer.' Despite this, Ms Hill said houses are going for hundreds of thousands of dollars above their market value. Last Saturday, Mr and Ms Hill attended an auction for a house in Wentworthville in Sydney's west that was advertised in the mid- $700,000s, with the RP Data property report listing the maximum value for the property as $865,000. 'The opening bid at the auction was $900,000,' said Ms Hill. 'There were about 30 registered bidders there, but there were only four active bidders after that. Everyone was in shock. 'It sold for $1.031 million, it's crazy.' Ms Hill said experiences like this one were 'shattering', particularly because the couple, who married in April, are ready to settle down. 'But you can't get too attached and that's hard because you want to and you want to settle down and make it your little nest.' Given the state of the property market, she and her husband are considering long-term renting and other forms of investment. 'We may just have to rent somewhere else but we're not going to be bullied by the market into over-investing and not getting value for money,' she said. 'We're going to find something that's affordable.'","A Senate Inquiry into Housing Affordability begins in Canberra tomorrow .

"By . Kate Lyons . Cricketing great Glenn McGrath has come under fire after Immigration Minister Scott Morrison presented cricket bats signed by him and fellow fast bowling great Brett Lee to the Indian government to secure their cooperation in accepting 157 asylum seekers detained at sea for four weeks. Mr Morrison presented cricket bats signed by McGrath and fellow fast bowler Brett Lee to Indian Home Affairs Minister Rajnath Singh and External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj when they met to discuss the deal last week. Glenn McGrath came under fire on social media for being associated with the deal - despite having no knowledge that the bats had been presented to the ministers. Scroll down for video . Glenn McGrath has come under fire for signing cricket bats that were presented to Indian officials as goodwill gifts by Scott Morrison before he negotiated a deal to return asylum seekers to India . 'You should be ashamed of yourself lending your name to send vulnerable refugees back to their misery! Disgusted,' wrote Dame Lisa Townes in a tweet later deleted from Glenn McGrath's account. But fast bowler defended himself against the criticism, saying he was a humanitarian - even though he had no knowledge the bat had been used by Mr Morrison. 'I do support asylum seekers & have compassion for humanity. I have always tried to help people but I sign a bat & I'm labelled otherwise?!!' he tweeted. The signed Kookaburra bats were presented to Ministers Singh and Swaraj last week as a gesture of goodwill before the meetings with Mr Morrison, which saw India agree to accept all Indian nationals and some Sri Lankan nationals on board the border protections vessel that has been floating off the coast of Australia for almost a month. Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee reported signed the bats as a favour to Immigration Minister Scott Morrison and knew what they were going to be used for . The Daily Telegraph reported that Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee were 'happy to sign the bats as a favour to Mr Morrison, after he told them what they were for' and many on social media took Glenn McGrath's involvement as a sign of his approval of the government's hard-line policy on asylum seekers. 'Ooh Ah Glenn McGrath loves Scott Morrison Ooh Eee Brett Lee loves what we do to asylum seekers,' wrote Bec. 'Very sad to see cricket legends Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee backing Scott Morrison's policies,' tweeted Leon Gettler. Scott Morrison announced on Friday that the Australian vessel carrying the 157 asylum seekers would be brought to Australia and so those on board could be processed, making it the first asylum seeker vessel to land in Australia since the government introduced its hard-line Stop The Boats campaign. The asylum seekers were detained on the boat for almost one month, leading to a High Court case which sought to determine if this detention was legal. It is believed the boat left Pondicherry in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu on June 11 and was intercepted by Australian border patrol on 29 June.

"By . Kate Lyons . A new online screening test for sexually transmitted infections will allow Australians to bypass their GP, scheduling tests online and receiving their results by SMS. The SmartSex website, to be rolled out in Sydney this week, allows patients to register online to be tested for a range of STIs. A pathology appointment is then booked without the need for a consultation with a GP and the results of the urine and blood test are then sent to the patient's phone. The SmartSex website was launched this week in Sydney. It allows people to book STI tests online and receive results via SMS . If the person tests positive for one of the infections, their results are also sent to their local GP and an appointment is then set up. The website comes as rates of STIs have increased dramatically in Australia, with a 79 per cent increase in diagnosis of STIs in the last 10 years. Some of the most common sexually transmitted infections include syphilis, chlamydia, hepatitis B, gonorrhoea, and HIV/AIDS, all of which have seen significant increases in rate of diagnosis in the last 10 years. More than 26,000 new cases of STIs were diagnosed last year in New South Wales alone, according to the Department of Health, though thousands of these cases go undiagnosed. The test is particularly aimed at people who feel embarrassed to visit their GP to discuss STIs . The SmartSex website aims to make testing easier and more discreet for those who might feel embarrassed to have a conversation about sexual health with a GP, with researching suggesting that women aged 18-30 are the most reluctant to visit their GP to get tested for STIs. 'There are some people who don’t consider themselves to be a risk. There are also a group of people who find it difficult because they don’t want to bring it up with their doctor,' Associate Professor David Wilson of the Kirby Institute told Daily Mail Australia. 'Some research particularly done out of the University of Melbourne, shows rates of testing are relatively low among young men and women.' However, Dr Wilson warns that not getting tested for STIs can do long term damage. 'The most common STI that is reported in Australia is chlamydia, and if left undiagnosed, it leaves somebody much more likely to be susceptible to infertility or ectopic pregnancy, it would roughly triple one’s risk.' There are approximately 80,000 diagnosed and 400,000 undiagnosed cases of chlamydia in Australia. Safe sex messaging services have been available for years, but the SmartSex website is unique in that it sends information to a patient's GP if it is suspected they have an STI, meaning they are less likely to slip through the cracks. 'We know that one of the most important things to do to bring down the high rate of STIs in this country is to get more people screened,' said Dr Wilson.

So when Nathan Humphris, 34, a plasterer, decided to propose to Ms Modra, 28, he answered her question in an over-the-top way – by covering her car in hundreds of post-it notes on which he had written: 'I love you this much'. Mr Humphris began the extravagant proposal by sending five bouquets of flowers, an hour apart, to Ms Modra's office, each one bearing a one-word note, which combined to read: 'I love you this much'. I love you this much: Nathan Humphris wrote a message of love on 1,500 post-it notes and covered his girlfriend's car with them before proposing to her later that evening . 'I thought, he's either done something really wrong I'm going to hear about it tonight, or there'll be something waiting for me at home,' she told Daily Mail Australia. When she finished for the day, Ms Modra walked to find her car covered in post-it notes. 'I got back to my car and sort of spotted it from a distance and knew where I parked, but thought I definitely didn't leave it like that, I was a bit taken aback,' she said. Mr Humphris had spent five hours writing 'I love you this much' on 1,500 post-it notes and, with the help of two friends, spent an hour covering her car with the message. 'We don't have a secret fetish for post-it notes,' Mr Humphris told Daily Mail Australia. 'It was just an over the top sort of thing.' Ms Modra said she was touched by the extravagant gesture but 'then I thought: How am I going to drive home?' Nathan Humphris said he never intended for his proposal to become public, but curious passersby took photos of the post-it-covered car and began an online search for the couple . Write caption here . When she arrived at the Adelaide home they share, Ms Modra found their front courtyard filled with 500 red and white balloons. 'There was a sea of balloons to my waist, so I had to swim through them,' she said. Inside, she found tea candles arranged in a love heart, banners hanging through the house, her favourite chocolates and cocktails laid out for her, and instructions about where to find her boyfriend. 'Eventually I found him and he was standing there in his suit getting a bit emotional. He gave the big speech about how much he loves me, how it's taken us a while but we got there, then he got down on one knee proposed.' Ms Modra accepted and the couple, who got together 10 years ago with a few breaks, are planning to get married in February or March next year. The couple insist that they did not want a public proposal, but passersby were so intrigued by the post-it covered car that they took photos and an online campaign started to find out the story behind the car. 'I wasn't looking to do a huge display of affection,' said Mr Humphris. 'In fact we only post-it-noted the window at 3.30 and she got to the car at 5.30, so it was only two hours, but people took photos.' Mr Humphris had intended to propose while the couple were on holiday at a luxury resort in Thailand, but decided against it, saying: 'I knew Belinda would prefer something a bit more personal, because if I put more effort in, I thought that would mean more to her than just spending a lot of money.'","Adelaide man proposed to his girlfriend by covering her car in post-it notes .

"By . Sally Lee . and Kate Lyons . Asylum seekers brought to the Australian mainland will seek compensation after being detained at sea for three weeks. The 157 asylum seekers including 50 children, who were detained on a Customs ship, are now at the Curtin detention centre in Western Australia after being flown from Cocos Island on Sunday. In a directions hearing on Monday, Justice Kenneth Hayne allowed lawyers for the asylum seekers to adjust their statement of claim to one of false imprisonment, with an application for compensation. A High Court hearing to determine if the government had the power to intercept their boat and transport them somewhere other than Australia will now not be scheduled for next week. Scroll down for video . A group of asylum seekers board an airplane at Cocos Island where they were flown to Australia on Sunday . The group of 157 asylum seekers were not 'economic migrants' and would apply for asylum in Australia, according to a lawyer representing them. The group of 157, including children, has been detained at sea since their boat was intercepted 27km from Christmas Island on July 7 . They were headed to the Cocos Islands airport where they will be flown to Curtin detention centre in Western Australia. Australian Greens say the asylum seeker group has a legal right to apply for asylum in Australia . Human rights lawyer and spokesman for the asylum seekers' legal team Hugh de Kretser said the case would still proceed, but on a more normal timeline. 'The main case which tests the legality of the government's actions - whether it was legal or not to take these asylum seekers away from Australia, detain them at sea for a month - remains,"" Mr de Kretser said. He said the case was now about two things: was it illegal for the government to take people away from Australia and detain them for a month at sea and if so, should the asylum seekers receive compensation for that. Mr de Kretser said it was too early to say how much asylum seekers would be seeking. It also emerged on Monday that 50 of the 157 asylum seekers are children. The group's boat was intercepted 27km from Christmas Island on July 7. Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said it was a positive outcome for the government's case. The court had agreed the case was now hypothetical and it was no longer appropriate to continue with next week's hearing, he said in a statement. The government had cooperated fully with the court and abided by all undertakings willingly and would continue to do so, he said. All people associated with the case had been transferred to the Curtin facility, Mr Morrison said. They were ineligible to apply for a protection visa in Australia and subject to transfer for offshore processing. The Indian government was open to consider the return of former or current Indian residents or nationals, including people who may have previously been in refugee camps in India, Mr Morrison said. But this would be subject to their identities being confirmed. India has agreed to take back its citizens and will consider taking Sri Lankan nationals who are Indian residents. Prime Minister Tony Abbott (left) and Immigration Minister (right) both say the 157 Tamil asylum seekers will not be settling in Australia . Australian Greens say the group has a legal right to apply for asylum in Australia. Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young is travelling to Curtin in the next few days to inquire on the children's welfare and to brief the asylum seekers of their rights. 'Just because (Prime Minister) Tony Abbott wants to trade in their lives, doesn't make it legal,' she said in Adelaide on Sunday. Mr Abbott has said the handling of the asylum seekers is legal and in accordance with Australia's international obligations. But he stressed they could never call Australia home because they did not come the 'right way'. The decision to bring the group to land pre-empts a High Court challenge against their detention at sea. Immigration Minister Scott Morrison vowed the passengers who do not return to their country of origin would be sent to Nauru or Manus Island. This is part of a new asylum-seeker deal where about two-thirds of the 157 passengers could be sent back to India. It is believed the asylum seekers will be taken to Curtin Detention Centre in Western Australia . A High Court case is trying to establish whether the detention of the asylum seekers on board the vessel, is legal under the Maritime Powers Act. Mr Morrison said that once the asylum seekers arrive in Australia, Indian officials will be granted consular access, and the Indian government has agreed to accept Indian citizens and some Sri Lankan nationals back into the country. The minister would not confirm what would happen to any asylum seekers on board the vessel who were not found to be Indian or Sri Lankan nationals, but stated categorically that 'they will not be resettled [in Australia].'","Lawyer Chris de Kretzer also says they are not 'economic migrants' and will seek asylum .

"By . Kate Lyons . Paracetamol, which is commonly prescribed to treat back pain, is ineffective in treating the ailment, with no more success in alleviating pain or speeding recovery than a placebo. Guidelines for treating back pain universally recommend the drug and Panadol sells a paracetamol product specifically targeting back pain. However, until now, no study had ever tested the effectiveness of paracetamol in treating back pain, compared to a placebo. A new study has found that paracetamol is ineffective in treating back pain, despite being recommended by doctors as the first line of treatment for the ailment . A University of Sydney study, published today in The Lancet, tested more than 1,600 people with acute uncomplicated lower back pain and found that no matter how much paracetamol was taken by participants it did not assist with recovery. Researchers said they were ‘very surprised' by the results, which contradicted common medical guidelines. Paracetamol is commonly prescribed to treat back pain. Panadol even has a product, whose active ingredient is paracetamol, that directly targets back and neck pain . For the study, participants were split into three groups – the first group took a placebo, the second took paracetamol whenever they experienced pain, and the third group was treated with paracetamol three times a day. The researchers expected to notice an improvement in reported pain among the third group, working on the hypothesis that many patients don't find paracetamol effective because they take inadequate quantities of the drug. However, the researchers found that no matter how much paracetamol was taken by participants it made no difference to pain relief or speed of recovery. Approximately half of the participants in the study recovered within two weeks and the most significant factor in recovery seemed to be whether or not they resumed normal physical activities, with patients who resumed physical activity faring better than those who did not.","Paracetamol does not alleviate back pain or speed recovery, according to a new study .

"By . Kate Lyons . Bob Geldof has attacked Australian political leaders for reneging on their promise to increase foreign aid, saying that they 'broke their word to the poorest people on the planet'. Speaking at the AIDS 2014 Conference in Melbourne, Mr Geldof said that AIDS was a symptom of poverty and countries like Australia had an obligation to help the world's poor. 'Remember, you're one of the richest countries in the world, even though you have your problems and you feel the pinch,' he said. Scroll down for video . Bob Geldof addressed the AIDS conference in Melbourne and criticised Australian leaders for breaking their commitment to increasing foreign aid . 'The Australian government promised to increase ODA [Official Development Assistance, or foreign aid] to 0.5 percent [of Gross National Income],' he said. 'The Australian people gave their word to the poorest people on the planet. You can't break your sovereign word to the poorest people, it's like beating up an infant,' said Mr Geldof. 'You can't f*** around with your political promise.' Mr Geldof was referencing the 2007 bipartisan commitment to increase Australia's foreign aid contribution to 0.5 per cent of gross national income by 2016-17. In 2012, Labor announced the increase to 0.5 percent would be delayed by 12 months and in the most recent budget the Coalition slashed foreign aid funding, with 20 percent of all budget cuts coming from the foreign aid budget, despite it making up less than 1.3 percent of the entire budget. Bob Geldof told the conference that AIDS was a symptom of poverty and that developed nations like Australia had an obligation to keep their promises to the poor . Mr Geldof named Tony Abbott and Julia Gillard in his address and said he was 'dismayed' that they had cut funding for foreign aid . At present Australia contributes approximately 0.35 percent of GNI (35¢ of every $100) to international aid. This amount is half of the recommended contribution of developed nations to foreign aid in order to achieve the United Nations millennium development goals, which aim to halve the number of people living on less than $1 a day by 2015. Mr Geldof also praised the AIDS researchers in the audience for the speed at which their work had progressed. '[It's been] thirty years, from a new pandemic on the streets of New York, where AIDS was first noticed, to almost being able to terminate it. I don't mean to big you guys up but it's amazing, it's never been done before.' Mr Geldof then condemned the 'preposterous reluctance to fund the last mile' of research, a comment that elicited applause from the audience.","Bob Geldof spoke at the AIDS 2014 Conference in Melbourne this afternoon .

Mr Smith said he estimated the bigger crocodile at five metres and the smaller one at three metres. 'But I didn't actually jump out with a tape measure. I just grabbed my camera straight away.' Mr Smith said the crocodile was two-thirds of his way through the smaller animal when their fishing boat stumbled upon the scene and only the tail of the smaller beast could be seen hanging out of the larger croc's jaws.

The cannibal croc devoured his younger mate to the astonishment of Mr Smith . The saltie was clearly hungry - devouring the 3m croc before moving on to his next meal . Last year Mr Smith spotted a crocodile feasting on a 300kg-400kg buffalo . 'It's not very common to see something like that… I have, probably over 20 years, seen something like this half a dozen times.' He said that crocodiles are known to turn to cannibalism, particularly during nesting season as mother crocs defend their babies. Last year Mr Smith also snapped pictures of a crocodile eating a 300-400kg buffalo while on a fishing trip with his brother and sons. 'The crocodile took it off like it didn't weigh a thing.

"By . Kate Lyons . An Australian weightlifter who received a silver medal at the Glasgow Commonwealth Games says he should have won the event, after a controversial judges' decision meant he missed out on winning gold. Simplice Ribouem, 31, looked set to win gold at the 94kg men's weightlifting event after Papua New Guinea's Steven Kari failed to lift 200kg in his final clean and jerk. On review, the lift was deemed good by the judges, and when Ribouem failed to lift 201kg, the gold was awarded to Kari. Australia's Simplice Ribouem says he should have received the gold medal for the men's 94kg weightlifting event after a controversial judge's decision meant he placed second . The jury that ruled Kari's lift was good contained a Papua New Guinean official and the wife of Kari's coach, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. Ribouem, who won gold for the event at the Commonwealth Games in Delhi four years ago, did not suggest the judges had acted improperly but said the lift should have been ruled invalid because Kari's elbow touched his knee during the lift. 'I'm upset… You can't do anything. The judges decide. I was planning to bring the gold to my two sons. Unfortunately I have silver and I have to accept that,' he told the Sydney Morning Herald.

Tranter pulled into first place after the breaststroke, which Tranter said was his strongest stroke. 'I've always had quite a natural and powerful breaststroke stroke... and it just so happens in the medley that the breaststroke tends to be the make-or-break leg. I'm quite lucky that my natural leg is the make or break,' he told the ABC. Tranter maintained his lead during the 200 metre freestyle leg beating out Scotland's Daniel Wallace and South Africa's Chad le Close, who won silver and bronze respectively.

"By . Kate Lyons . Mady White shared a picture of herself with one of Moo's kittens before Moo was gruesomely killed . The woman whose cat was decapitated in a gruesome attack last month has fled the Gold Coast after a sustained hate campaign against her. Mady White, 20, was the owner of a cat named Moo, whose head and paws were cut off and whose blood was used to write a threatening message on a garage door in Arundel on the Gold Coast on June 17. The message 'Whers [sic] my money? Tik tok!' was found daubed on the garage door, in what was believed to be a revenge attack against the homeowners. Jordan Isaiah Christie, 19, was charged with injuring animals, wilful damage and arson after Moo's body was found on the doorstep of a house. Christie faced court on July 1 and was denied bail because he was deemed an 'unacceptable risk' of him reoffending. Ms White told Daily Mail Australia that she was shocked to discover the dead cat in news reports was hers and said she didn't believe her cat had been specifically targeted. 'Pretty much it was my cat being in the wrong place at the wrong time,' she said. Ms White, who suffers from cystic fibrosis, said she was deeply affected by the death of her cat and spent two to three weeks in hospital after Moo was killed. 'The stress makes me sick. Whenever I get put under too much pressure I get sick,' she told Daily Mail Australia. Ms White said her problems have continued in the month since her cat was killed. Her home has been broken into twice since the incident and her car was stolen, which Ms White thinks is part of a sustained hate campaign against her, leading her to flee the Gold Coast. Scroll down for video . Ms White said her cat's death was the first in a series of 'payback' crimes against her . Ms White's cat was used in a gruesome crime last month, though Ms White believes her cat was just in the wrong place at the wrong time . Ms White said her black Holden Cruze was stolen on Wednesday after she gave a lift to someone she knew. 'I was doing a friend a favour, I was giving him a lift, he held a weapon to me and told me to get out of the car,' Ms White said. The theft was particularly devastating because her car contained a month's supply of an experimental drug worth $30,000 that treats cystic fibrosis. Ms White has now gone six days without the medication, Kalydeco, which must be administered 12 hours apart and she said her condition has already begun to deteriorate. As well as her car being stolen, Ms White's house was broken into twice – on the night of carjacking and on the following night. 'Phones, money, jewellery, clothes –  all were taken. As was my wallet, my ID, my Medicare card, my health care card, cash,' she said. At the time of the break-ins Ms White had a friend and her friend's baby living with her. 'She was very terrified for her child,' said Ms White. Jordan Christie, 19, has been charged with killing Ms White's cat, as well as arson, extortion and wilful damage to property . Ms White is convinced the three events, which she has reported to police, are related and are part of a sustained hate campaign against her. 'I don't think it's about the cat thing,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'The person who took my car thinks I've done something to him, which I haven't done.' She believes the person who stole her car also orchestrated her house burglaries and 'wants to get more people to target me'. Ms White has fled the Gold Coast and is now staying with family. 'I just want to get away and get healthy. I don't even want to be in the Gold Coast anymore.' Ms White says she is not scared, but she wants the abuse to end. 'I don't know what to feel. I haven't personally been threatened, but everything of value to me has been taken.' Police are searching for Ms White's car, which was involved in a petrol drive-off at a service station on Sunday night.

"By . Kate Lyons . A new book tells the stories of Australians whose family members returned as ghosts or in dreams to give them messages of comfort, warn them against danger and in some cases save their lives. The following stories are edited excerpts from Love Never Dies by Karina Machado. 'Look after Mum' Bianca was just 15 when her older brother, Stephen, died in a motorbike accident in 1988. Now aged 41, a nurse and mother-of-three, Bianca tells how Stephen appeared to her regularly for two years after his death. The first visit came on the eve of his funeral. Bianca and her mother were sharing Stephen's bed, because the house was packed with family for the funeral. Bianca's mother was sleeping, but Bianca was awake and unsettled, sensing that something was about to happen. Stephen (left) died at the age of 18 in a motorbike accident in 1988. He appeared to his sister Bianca (right) repeatedly for two years after he died . She put down her book and saw Stephen, wearing his favourite black-and-grey striped dress shirt, the one his mother had given the funeral directors to bury him in. 'It was as bright as anything in the room. All I could see was from his abdomen up and his hands were together, as if he was praying, and he was really staring at Mum and me. He was looking straight at us. 'The feeling that I got – he wasn't talking – was ""Look after Mum"". That's what I felt he was trying to communicate. Then I quickly closed my eyes and he was gone.' 'I honestly do believe that he saved me…' On Friday February 2, 2013, less than two months after the sudden death of her beloved husband, Leigh, Natasha, 32, went to bed planning to end her life the next day. Natasha was wracked with grief and unable to navigate life without the man she met when she was just 17, Natasha saw no way out except to join her husband in death. But in the early hours of the morning, as Natasha was drifting between sleep and wakefulness, her beloved Leigh, whom she had died in hospital after she discovered him unresponsive in their bed and attempted to save by CPR, appeared in front of her. 'All of a sudden, Leigh was beside me … and he looked exactly like he always did. He had his hair the way he always wore it. I could smell his Chanel Egoiste. He was just Leigh, in every way. I turned to him and said, ""Am I dreaming or am I awake?"" He said, ""You're awake. I'm with you."" 'I said to him, ""Do you know how sad and hurt I am?"" He said, ""Yes, bubby, I know, and I'm so sorry but I'm never far away from you"".' 'I was crying and he was crying and we were just holding one another. I could actually feel his touch on me! I could smell him. We had a full conversation. 'He said, ""I was with you. I know you tried to save me."" I said to him: ""What am I going to do?"" And he told me that one day we'd be together again, that there are too many things I need to do first, but then he would come and get me. I said, ""But when? Just do it now."" He said, ""No I can't take you yet. You'll be okay. I'll never be far away from you.""' Natasha said she woke up, her pillow saturated with tears and she could smell Leigh's aftershave and feel him stroking her hair. She said his visit saved her life. 'When he came to me that night, I believe he knew what I was planning to do. He was my saviour because no-one else would have gotten through to me, and I thank him for that. I honestly do believe that he saved me that night.' This is the third book about the supernatural from author Karina Machado . Love Never Dies, concerns After Death Contact (ADC), the name given to experiences where loved ones send a message to or speak to those they have left behind. Author Karina Machado said that the uniting theme in the stories of those she interviewed for the book was love. 'Love is everything, and perhaps it's love that's powering a spirit to a bereaved person's side,' she told Daily Mail Australia. For many interviewees, Karina was the first person they told about the incident and they were relieved to tell their story to someone who would listen without prejudice. 'Perhaps many of us have had ADCs and we just haven't realised, or we've laughed them off or we've thought, that's silly, or I'm dreaming. How many of us have had them without realising, myself included?' Karina says that everyone has some awareness of the spirit world, but that some are 'more in tune than others', she says she is less in tune than others, including her mother, who frequently had psychic premonitions. 'I think there's a spectrum of awareness and most of us are down the bottom of the spectrum, where, for instance you might be thinking of somebody and the phone rings and it's them... Then at the other end of the spectrum are people and spirits appear to them in absolute flesh and blood, that's how real they are,' she said. Despite being lower down on the spectrum, Karina has always been fascinated by the supernatural and this is her third book on the subject. She said that while people might be sceptical, her goal is to share people's stories, rather than convert all doubters. 'My whole point in writing these books is not to stand on a soapbox and declare: ""Believe, believe, you must believe!"" My point in sharing these people's experiences is I'm a story-teller, not a scientist and I'm not an expert. I haven't tested these theories out in a laboratory. 'All I can say is I'm sharing my interviewees' experiences because they're valuable and they've made an impact on their lives; because a story is always a treasure to be shared.' 'Could it have been Matthew looking after me?' 'As far back as I can remember, I've known about Matthew,' says Erika of the eldest of her parents' four children who was stillborn in 1984. But Matthew first appeared to her in 1993 when she was four-years-old and experiencing recurring nightmares about death. They varied in specifics – little Erika trapped in a coffin, Erika as a teenager being attacked by a shark, Erika as an old woman at the end of a pitiful life where they was 'nothing after, there was no point to being alive' – but they all left her terrified. One night she woke from one of these nightmares and saw with relief that she was not alone. A little boy was sitting on her bed, smiling, she knew it was the brother she never met. 'Matthew?' she said aloud to the boy. He smiled and the thought immediately appeared in her mind: 'You are not alone.' Now 24, the Perth girl said that Matthew continued to appear to her throughout her childhood, including when she lost her great-grandmother at the age of 13 and then again when her grandfather died in 2008. Each time, Matthew looked older than he did when he last visited. Erika says that Matthew stepped in to save her life in January 2012, stopping her from being hit by a bus. 'I got off at my bus stop and I was crossing the road and I saw that the bus still had its indicator to the left so he wasn't turning out yet. 'When I was walking in front of the bus I saw that it was starting to move, but I just kept walking forward, with my earphones in, listening to music.' As she crossed the road, Erika felt 'cool breezes' despite the warmth of the day, and felt her brother smile at her as she crossed the road, but thought little of it until the next day when she was approached by an elderly lady who regularly catches the same bus as her. The woman leaned in and whispered: 'I cannot believe you are still alive.' 'She said that the bus had stopped indicating and was pulling out onto the road. She freaked out, said she was about to scream at the bus driver because she saw me walking right in front of it; she blinked and I was on the other side of the road. She couldn't explain it. 'I thought, ""Could it have been Matthew looking after me?"" I still can't explain it, but every time I think about it, I see Matthew's smiling face.'

"By . Kate Lyons . Federal treasurer Joe Hockey believed the May budget, which delivered huge cuts to welfare and education, was 'too soft' and he campaigned to make it even tougher. Sources inside the budget meetings claimed that Mr Hockey pushed for tougher budget measures during meetings, but was stymied by Prime Minister Tony Abbott who wanted to adopt a 'more cautious' approach. The revelations have come from a new biography of Joe Hockey, released today, Hockey: Not Your Average Joe, written by Fairfax and ABC journalist Madonna King with the cooperation of Mr Hockey. Scroll down for video . Joe Hockey wanted the government's budget to be even tougher than it was, according to a new biography of the treasurer released today . A source told Ms King: '[The budget] wasn't as tough as Joe would have liked but a good compromise. Maybe it's tougher than the Prime Minister would do if Joe wasn't there to drive it,' the Sydney Morning Herald reported. King wrote: 'In reality, the budget was much softer than Joe would have liked. He wanted changes to pensions made earlier and the deficit levy to net more taxpayers … But Abbott, who chaired each of the expenditure review committee meetings, was taking a much more cautious approach than his Treasurer, no doubt with one eye firmly on the reaction of voters.' At the moment a two percent deficit levy applies to people with incomes over $180,000, but the book claims the government considered imposing the deficit levy on incomes more than $80,000. Sources inside the budget meetings said Joe Hockey pushed Tony Abbott toward tougher budget measures . Joe Hockey is revealed in the book as Tony Abbott's likely successor, with the prime minister's chief of staff Peta Credlin telling Ms King that the treasurer has 'got his head above every other contender', the Sydney Morning Herald reported. Do you think the federal budget was tough enough? The May budget, which contained a raft of unpopular measures, including a proposed Medicare co-payment, raising the retirement age, and the deregulation of university fees, is widely considered responsible for the dramatic slump in popularity of Mr Abbott and his government. A Newspoll published by The Australian earlier this month found that Bill Shorten had a 10-point lead on Tony Abbott as preferred prime minister, with 44 percent  saying they would rather the Labor leader was in charge, compared to only 34 percent preferring Mr Abbott. The poll also showed that if the election were held today Labor would win, with the ALP scoring 55 percent of the two-party-preferred vote, compared to 45 percent for the Coalition, almost a complete reversal of the election results last September.

Australia's resolution condemning the downing of flight MH17 and demanding full access to the site from investigators has been unanimously adopted by the UN Security Council. Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop told the UN Security Council that the MH17 crash was an 'outrage', she also condemned the 'grotesque violations' at the crash site, reported the ABC. The UN Security Council unanimously  supported the resolution at 5am (AEST) today in New York. It was thought Russia might veto the resolution after they took umbrage with the phrase 'shooting down', but they supported the resolution after changing part of the wording. Scroll down for video . Australia's foreign minister Julie Bishop speaks during a meeting of the United Nations Security Council. The UN Security Council voted this morning to condemn the downing of the plane and demanded full and unfettered access to the crash site . Ms Bishop said the vote was 'an unambiguous response from the international community on an utterly deplorable act,' reported the ABC. 'The victims must be treated with dignity. It is despicable that this access is not being provided. It is an affront to the victims and their families,' she said. The bodies of the MH17 victims, including the 37 Australians killed in the disaster, will be transferred to Amsterdam as soon as possible, Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk says. Some 250 bodies are currently being kept in refrigerated train cars in rebel-controlled eastern Ukraine, but Mr Yatsenyuk said 'bloody guerrillas don't allow the train to leave' the station at Torez. Tony Abbott revealed he has spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin who had 'said all the right things' and would be held to his word . But when they do, the Ukrainian government plans to send the bodies to the Netherlands. 'We are ready to transfer all the bodies directly to Amsterdam as one of the best well-equipped forensic laboratories is located in Amsterdam,' Mr Yatsenyuk told reporters in Kiev. The Netherlands will lead the investigation working with the international community and Ukrainian authorities to identify the victims. Prime Minister Tony Abbott said former Defence Chief Angus Houston would lead Australia's efforts on the ground to recover, identify and repatriate the dead. The Australian Government has deployed 45 officials to assist, including 20 from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, 20 Australian Federal Police Officers, two Australian Transport Safety Bureau investigators and three Defence officials. International investigators were starting to get more access to the crash site, but still not enough, according to Mr Abbott . Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 is believed to have been blown out of the sky last Thursday by a surface-to-air missile, killing all 298 passengers and crew. International investigators were starting to get more access to the crash site, but still not enough, according to Mr Abbott. 'This is still an absolutely shambolic situation,' Mr Abbott said. Mr Abbott revealed he has spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin who had 'said all the right things' and would be held to his word. The Prime Minister has also started contacting the families of the 37 Australians killed in the MH17 disaster, adding that the families may never come to terms with their loss. 'These are families in very difficult circumstances, numb with grief and only beginning to come to terms with their loss,' he said. 'I don't want to cause anyone any individual grief but I want them to know the Prime Minister is available to them at any time.' Mr Abbott has been the most vocal of any world leader in repeatedly accusing Russia of trying to wash its hands of the disaster, and failing to properly secure the crash site. His priority is to do 'the right thing' by the Australian victims and their families by ensuring bodies are treated with respect, the crash site is secured and a thorough investigation undertaken. 'Then of course, we have to punish the guilty,' he said. 'We have to do our best to identify the perpetrators and bring them to justice.' Mr Abbott said he had a productive conversation with his Russian counterpart, who assured the Australian Prime Minister he would do the right things by the victims' families . Mr Abbott said while there had been some signs of improvement, including Ukrainian government officials gaining some access to the site, the situation was still completely unacceptable. 'The site is being treated more like a garden clean-up than a forensic investigation,' he said. 'The wreckage has been picked over, it's been trashed, it's been trampled.' Mr Abbott said an Australian military aircraft was on standby to 'play our part to ensure that we get justice for the dead and closure for the living'. Ms Bishop said the government was committed to returning the bodies of the victims to their families. 'They have been murdered and the Australian government will not rest until we're able to bring the bodies home to the Australian families who are waiting for them,' she said. Memorial services have been held across Australia in the days following the crash and tributes have flowed in honour of the 37 victims. Among them on Monday were students at a NSW primary school who silently shed tears as they left flowers and messages in front of a memorial to former deputy principal Michael Clancy and his wife Carol. Mr Clancy only retired last year after 22 years as a teacher and deputy principal at Albion Park Public School, south of Wollongong. 'To Mr Clancy, Mrs Clancy. We will all miss you. I wish R.I.P. meant ""Return in peace"". You will always be in my heart. Love from Ella,' a student wrote on heart-shaped paper. Tributes also flowed from colleagues of Sydney kindergarten teacher Gabriele Lauschet. Ms Lauschet, known as Gaby to her friends and colleagues, was due to start the school term on Monday at the German International School in Sydney's north where she had taught for 14 years. 'Everyone's reminded of Gaby... it's not easy to come back to work, this environment and know that she's gone,' Principal Erhad Seifert said. To add to the heartbreak, the 47-year-old German national had only months earlier become engaged to another staff member, the school's business manager Andreas Schaaf.","Julie Bishop condemned the 'grotesque violations' that had occurred at the scene of the crash .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . He was the mastermind of the mass prison break from a German camp which inspired the iconic film The Great Escape. But a new book has now suggested Spitfire pilot Roger Bushell could also have been linked to the assassination of notorious Nazi officer Reinhard Heydrich, known as 'Hitler's Hangman' and the acting Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia. Simon Pearson's The Great Escaper places Bushell in Prague at the time Heydrich's car was bombed by Czechoslovakian Jan Kubiš, and Slovak Jozef Gabčík, which led to the Nazi officer's death a number of days later. Hero: A new book suggests pilot Roger Bushell, left, may have been behind the assassination of feared Nazi Reinhard Heydrich, right, in June 1942 . Mr Pearson writes that although it is not known for certain whether Bushell was involved in the assassination, he had been among Prague's resistance fighters at the time and was even taken in for questioning by the Gestapo, The Times has reported. Bushell, who was also known as 'Big X', had been hiding in Prague for a number of months. During his time in the city he was offered shelter by Blažena Zeithammelová, who worked for the resistance. Her family had also previously attempted to kill the head of the SS, Heinrich Himmler, while members of the Three Kings underground network. Mr Pearson, whose book is being serialised in The Times, writes Zeithammelová and her family were executed following Heydrich's death, in a huge purge of Prague ordered by Hitler. Bushell however was sent to Stalag Luft III following his interrogation by the Gestapo, which became 'an operational outpost of British intelligence' thanks to his system of coded letters. Bushell was also head of the escape committee at the prisoner of war camp, which saw him come up with a plan to help 200 prisoners out of the camp. Wing Commander Bob Tuck with Squadron Leader Roger Bushell (right), the man responsible for organising the Great Escape. Upon being recaptured he was murdered by the Gestapo on March 29, 1944 . Evil: Reinhard Heydrich, pictured far left with Adolf Hitler, was a high-ranking Nazi and a key figure in the Holocaust . He managed to lead 75 men out of one of three tunnels on March 24, 1944 before guards discovered the escape attempt. He was 33 when he was shot by the Gestapo on Hitler's personal orders after being recaptured near the French border. In 2011 the Daily Mail reported how light had been cast on Bushell's life after letters, diaries and photographs which survived the war had been handed over to the Imperial War Museum. Squadron Leader Bushell, who lived in South Africa up until he was 14, was a Cambridge graduate, barrister and international skiier. The mass breakout from the prison camp was highlighted in Paul Brickhill's book The Great Escape and also in the film that featured Richard Attenborough. But in the film the character was renamed Roger Barlett and bore little resemblance to the actual man.

"By . Kate Lyons . A NSW Nationals MP told a female cabinet minister that he would 'tear her a new orifice' and said she had 'never had a real man' because he was unhappy with a decision made by her department. John Williams, the Nationals member for Murray-Darling, verbally abused then-environment minister and NSW Liberal MP Robyn Parker in April this year. Ms Parker has spoken publicly about how she was raped as a teenager and lived in fear afterwards, nailing the windows of her bedroom shut. John Williams aimed a sexist attack at NSW Liberal MP Robyn Parker, threatening that he would 'tear her a new orifice' The attack occurred during his bid for pre-selection for the upper house in April in front of 100 Nationals members, reported the Sydney Morning Herald. Nationals members who attended the pre-selection meeting at Parliament House told the Sydney Morning Herald they were offended by Mr Williams' comment, but the sexist comments were not publicly admonished by party leaders present at the event. Mr Williams was endorsed by the party, but is in fourth position on the ballot, meaning it is highly unlikely he will be elected to the upper house in the state election next March. Mr Williams wrote a letter to Ms Parker the day after the pre-selection meeting  in which he acknowledged the incident, though most of the letter was dedicated to urging Ms Parker to reversing the decision of her 'megalomaniac bureaucrats' the Sydney Morning Herald reported. Ms Parker said that abuse such as this is a deterrent for young women who might wish to enter politics . 'Regrettably, I let my emotions take over and said some things that probably destroyed my chances of a winnable place,' Mr Williams wrote to Ms Parker. The incident highlights the sexist treatment women encounter while in office, said Ms Parker. 'When I am trying to encourage young women to take leadership roles, this is the sort of behaviour they are up against. It's no wonder they choose an alternative path,' Ms Parker told the Sydney Morning Herald. Mr Williams has been the member for Murray-Darling since 2007, however the recent redistribution of electoral boundaries meant his electorate combined with Barwon, which is currently represented by Nationals cabinet minister Kevin Humphries. Mr Williams agreed to run for the upper house, rather than contest Mr Humphries's seat. The Nationals party can expect to secure three seats in the upper house in next year's state election, so Mr Williams's position in fourth place on the ballot means his seat is almost unwinnable.","John Williams, member for Murray-Darling, verbally abused Robyn Parker .

Caro Harding, 47, posted a photograph taken at the couple's wedding with the caption: '25 years ago I married the love of my life you are my everything and always will be.' The Inverell Public School kindergarten teacher was travelling in a light plane to Brisbane for a family holiday on Friday along with her 13-year-old daughter and her husband, Dr Mark Harding, 52, who was piloting the plane. Caro Harding posted a picture to Facebook celebrating 25 years of marriage on Tuesday, just days before she died in a light plane crash . The Cessna 210 aircraft came down in Clive State Forest not long after takeoff and while all three escaped the wreckage, the plane then burst into flames and Mr and Mrs Harding received severe burns. The family were initially taken to Inverell Hospital but Mr and Mrs Harding were later flown to Toyal North Shore hospital in Sydney. Mrs Harding had sustained burns to 70 percent of her body and died in hospital on Saturday morning. Dr Harding remains in a critical condition and the couple's daughter suffered burns to her legs.

"By . Kate Lyons . and Sally Lee . The name of the woman whose vile racist rant on a train in Sydney went viral this week is not Sue Wilkins, as previously thought, but Karen Bailey. Ms Bailey, 55, was stopped by police yesterday when she got off the train in Strathfield and gave them a false name. It has also emerged that Ms Bailey has worked as a legal secretary in some of the country's top law firms and the Crown Solicitors Office. Scroll down for video . Video footage was filmed this week on a Sydney train where a woman hurled racist abuse at an Asian woman by mocking her accent and pulling her eyes back to imitate slant eyes . The racist woman then turned her attention to the man filming the scene, who was next to the Asian woman, saying he 'can't even get a regular girlfriend, it's so sad, he's got to get a gook' Her LinkedIn profile, which has been deleted, said she worked at law firms including Avant Law, Baker & McKenzie, Sparke Helmore, Norton White and Herbert Smith Freehills. Chief Inspector Rod Peet from Wyong police told MailOnline she made up the name 'Sue Wilkins'. Ms Bailey was arrested last night after a member of the public recognised Ms Bailey from the video and contacted police. She was charged with offensive conduct, which carries a maximum penalty of $660 and three months imprisonment. It was revealed this morning that Ms Bailey abused other passengers on the train, swearing in the face of a 10-year-old boy and telling a grandmother to move her 'f***ing bogan children off the seat'. Lake Macquarie mother Jade Marr said that Ms Bailey verbally abused her children, Kendall, 10, and Jackson, 7, who were on an outing to Sydney to see the Lion King stage show before she launched into a racist tirade against an Asian passenger. Ms Marr said Bailey approached her children and mother who were sitting together on a three-seater seat in the packed carriage and told them to move. 'She walked straight on the train, looked at my mum and said “get your f...ing bogan children off the seat."" Then she said ""there are people here that need to sit down, I want to sit down,""' Ms Marr told the Newcastle Herald. Ms Marr said that when the children didn't move, Bailey began swearing and when Ms Marr asked her to stop swearing, she responded by  'screaming the f-word in my son's face 10 times. She said “you need to learn this word kid,""' reported the Newcastle Herald. Bailey told the children, who later in the journey gave up their seats for two elderly passengers, that she was going to call the police to report them for not moving off the seats to accommodate her. Ms Marr said she had no intention make her children move for a bully like Bailey. Kareem Abdulm, who uploaded the original video on YouTube of Bailey's racist rant said he began filming just after Bailey was aggressive to the children. 'This video begins just after she had started screaming expletives into the face of the upset kids and the mother of the children got up to stand in between the lady and her kids,' he wrote. 'The lady then assaulted the mother and a young dude who gave up his seat for her.' The man filmed the woman complaining to police on the phone about the children who would not offer her their seats. In the footage, Bailey makes racist comments and racist gestures toward a young, Asian, female passenger who refuses to give up her seat to Wilkins. She also targets the man filming the scene, who was next to the Asian woman, saying he 'can't even get a regular girlfriend, it's so sad, he's got to get a gook'. 'He's too lazy to jerk off, he can only get a gook,' the rant continued. 'Gook' is a derogatory term for people of Asian descent which started in the Vietnam War. Ms Bailey apologised to the victim after the video went public and acknowledged there were no excuse for such offensive behaviour. 'It's awful and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy, regardless of any race,' she said in an exclusive interview with Ninemsn. 'It's not nice what I did to that lady.' The train was traveling from Newcastle and Central Coast Line as some commuters warned the woman that she would be charged with assault when they arrived at Strathfield station, Sydney's inner west . Bailey, who had recently returned from Holland to live with family in the Central Coast in Sydney's north, said she was having a 'rotten day'. 'I've been chasing work for quite some time now. It's awful what I said to that woman, I do agree,' she said. 'It wasn't nice to say that to her because it's not nice when people say that to me ... call me white trash and fatso. I know how it hurts and I shouldn't be saying it to other people.' Bailey said she has been the victim of a $100,000 scam by a mystery Dutchman, whom she met on dating website RSVP. After she caused a scene inside the carriage, police first spoke to Ms Wilkins on Wednesday when she alighted at Strathfield in Sydney's west. They decided to let her 'go about her journey', NSW Police Transport Command Assistant Commissioner Max Mitchell told reporters. Sydney Trains chief executive Howard Collins - the former boss of London Underground - added that he had not seen anything like it in 37 years as a transport executive. The incident occured at about 4pm on Wednesday on a northbound train heading from Sydney's Central station to the NSW central coast. This isn't the first incident of its kind in Australia, where two young women kicked and spat on a vision-impaired elderly man on a Gold Coast bus, Brisbane's south, in September. A Melbourne man was also jailed for 21 days in March after racially abusing a French tourist on a bus in 2012. Another racist attack on public transport involved an ABC newsreader Jeremy Fernandez, where he was subject to a 15-minute rant on a Sydney bus in April last year, was told go back to his country and called a 'black c***'. Fernandez declined to comment on this week's abuse when contacted by Daily Mail Australia. Vic Alhadeff, Chairman of NSW Community Relations Commission, described the recent abuse as a 'despicable act'. '(It) violates everything that we stand for as a proudly multicultural state which embraces diversity and celebrates difference, he said. 'Such outbursts of racism demean us as a society, and we encourage all who witness such offensive behaviour in future to condemn it immediately and unreservedly.' NSW Minister for Transport Gladys Berejiklian said she is 'disgusted by any kind of racism or threatening behaviour towards customers using public transport'. A Sydney Trains and NSW TrainLink spokeswoman said they condemn any form of abuse on their services. 'The safety of our customer is our priority and we will continue to work with the Police Transport Command to respond to these incidents,' she said. Witnesses should contact police on Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000. Did you witness this scene or know this woman?

"By . Kate Lyons . Zoe Woolmer, 23, passed away on June 15 when she fell while walking King's Canyon in Central Australia . A month after she plunged to her death at a popular tourist spot in the Northern Territory, mystery still surrounds the final moments of British tourist Zoe Woolmer. The 23-year-old backpacker was killed in a fall at Kings Canyon in central Australia on June 15 and her family travelled out to Alice Springs from the UK last week seeking answers. Police still have not revealed the cause of the traveller's death, saying only that 'the investigation is ongoing and a report is being prepared for the coroner.' Ms Woolmer was from Hertfordshire and studied Human Resources at the University of Portsmouth. She was on a trip of a lifetime to Australia and had been travelling through the country for over a year. Zoe had been visiting Melbourne prior to visiting the Red Centre and had lived in Sydney for several months before the accident. She passed away after falling 30 metres while completing the rim walk at Kings Canyon, 450km west of Alice Springs on the afternoon of June 15. While she was able to talk to paramedics after the fall, she passed away later that day. Zoe's family and friends paid tribute to Ms Woolmer on social media. Her mother Dawn wrote on Facebook two days after the incident: 'It is with a heavy heart that our family and friends report the sad loss of our dear Zoe during her much loved trip to Australia. Words fail us during the difficult time.' Zoe's friend Connie Patterson, with whom Zoe had been travelling in Australia, wrote: 'RIP my beautiful best friend Zoe Woolmer. 'I miss you like crazy and cannot ever put into words how much I love you and the great experiences we have shared together!' Zoe Woolmer was on the trip of a lifetime travelling through Australia when she died . Friends and family have taken to social media to pay tribute to Zoe, with Zoe's mother writing that 'words failed her' at the loss . Zoe's family travelled from the UK to Alice Springs last week and met with police and the tour company that conducted the King's Canyon walk. The tributes to Zoe come as photographs emerge of unsafe practices by tour guides at The Rock Tour, the company conducting the walk Zoe was on. The photographs show tour guides skylarking at the edges of Kings Canyon – posing close to the edge and standing on small ledges above 50 metre drops. Adam Cooper, who was a tour guide with the company from March 2011 to April 2012 and returned in March 2014 for five weeks, told MailOnline that at Kestrel Falls, the area of the walk where it is believed Ms Woolmer died, walkers regularly pose on a thin ledge, only a metre wide, above a 50 metre drop. 'There's actually a bit up near the waterfall where... guides encourage people to take a photo off the ledge, it's so dangerous, if you fell that'd be falling 50 metres,' he said. Numerous photographs of The Rock Tour guides and walkers posing on the ledge or posing close to the edge of the canyon, even in the rain when the sandstone would be slippery, have been posted to the Facebook pages of The Rock Tour guides, and some have been posted to the company's Facebook page. The photos have since been taken down by the company. The Rock Tour conducted the walk at King's Canyon that resulted in the death of a female backpacker two weeks ago. One of their guides is pictured here leaning over the cliff edge next to a warning sign in August 2013 . Left: A Rock Tour guide poses on a ledge while doing the Rim Walk at Kings Canyon. Right: A Rock Tour guide pretends to stamp on the head of a tourist who is standing on a ledge at the canyon . Three tourists pose on the ledge, above a large drop at Kestrel Falls in the rain. The photo was posted to The Rock Tour Facebook page on April 12 this year . Managing director of The Rock Tour, Rob Cowan stated that photographs are uploaded to the company's Facebook page by employees and the page is regularly monitored by company management. 'Whenever management sees a photograph depicting inappropriate behaviour they remove the picture and talk to the guide in question', he said. 'We have a three-strikes-you're-out policy,' he said and commented that two of the tour guides depicted in the photographs obtained by MailOnline had since been fired or encouraged to leave the company. Police are investigating the cause of Ms Woolmer's death and have taken statements from the other 16 people in the tour group. An English tourist, in her 20s, has fallen to her death while walking in the Watarrka National Park in remote Central Australia .

"By . Kate Lyons . and Aap . and Freya Noble . City of Sydney council admits it did not follow up a complaint about a property being used illegally to house backpackers, after a fire unearthed the makeshift slum. Backpackers who were living in shipping containers and caravans on the industrial complex in Alexandria that was destroyed by the fire were paying as little as $80-a-week for their accommodation. On Thursday the City revealed after an 'extensive review' of its phone records, it found one complaint. 'Unfortunately, contrary to city procedures, the complaint was not logged in the internal records system and was therefore not found or investigated,' the council said in statement. Scroll down for video . The fire broke out at a bus parking facility at about 1.40am on Wednesday and was fast-moving and intense . Firefighters were shocked to find people living in the industrial complex, it is believed they were illegally living in shipping containers . While the complaint did not include an address, the council determined that it referred to the property involved in the blaze, and as a result of this discovery, the council has started an immediate review of all relevant procedures. It is also preparing to serve a Local Government Act Order to the owner of the property, which will block access to the site. However on Tuesday, the City of Sydney told the Daily Mail Australia it had received no complaints of people living unauthorised in the business park. 'The City has received no previous reports or complaints of this kind about the premises. We investigate all reports of unauthorised use of premises for accommodation to prevent dangerous events like this from occurring.' The council said today such complaints were not uncommon - it had investigated more than 1000 reports of unauthorised property use and overcrowding in the past year. 'Overcrowding and the use of premises as unauthorised short-term accommodation is an ongoing issue for many local councils,' a council spokeswoman said. City of Sydney used the Alexandria squalor to call for greater powers to tackle the illegal accommodation problem. The fire and the property owner, Masaaki Imaeda, are under investigation by council and police . The property was authorised as a business park, meaning it was illegal to use it for residential purposes. The maximum penalty for a breach of the act is $1.1 million. One of the 18 tourists who had been staying in the accommodation told The Daily Telegraph that he had been living there for four months and that 15 people shared one toilet. The fire was brought under control by firefighters in a few hours, the reason for the blaze is not yet known . Eigi Tamada, from Japan said the people sleeping in the shipping containers were 'very scared' when the fire broke out. 'Suddenly there was a big bang, then there was smoke, we ran out,' he told The Daily Telegraph. A woman who operated a catering business from the site in Alexandria told the Sydney Morning Herald that her landlord, Masaaki Imaeda, had started renting out an old bus with no wheels and two caravans to foreign nationals two months ago to 'make a quick buck'. She set Imaeda had set up washing machines and other appliances around the complex and put a portaloo in a car wash area. 'It's obscene, now I've lost my business because of his greed. That's it, I'm done,' she told the Sydney Morning Herald. About 70 firefighters were called to the blaze in Alexandria, Sydney, which broke out around 1.40am on Wednesday. The fire started in a building near the squatters' camp but investigators don't think the group, aged in their late teens and early 20s, had anything to do with it starting. Crews were stunned to find 18 people, thought to be from Japan and South Korea, squatting in the containers at the site on Burrows Road. Firefighters thought they had been called to a run-of-the-mill industrial fire but it quickly became a rescue operation when people began running out from the back of the bus parking businesss. The squatters were living in shocking conditions on mattresses in a shipping container, an old mini-bus and a caravan. Four people were rescued and 14 evacuated by firefighters from the fire, which firefighters described as a 'severe threat to life' NSW Fire & Rescue Commissioner Greg Mullins said four people had to be rescued as they were too frightened to move. 'There were 20-metre flames,' he told reporters on Wednesday. 'Had the firefighters not realised they were there, they well could have lost their lives.' 'I'm outraged that there would be something like this in the heart of Sydney,' he said. 'It looks like someone has been taking advantage of these people, maybe they were squatters we don't know yet.' The tourists have since been taken to alternative accommodation, a hotel in the CBD. The owner of the property, who claimed to live on site, spent the morning exploring the smouldering damage alongside detectives, and it's understood he knew the backpackers were lodging in his building, as he confirmed the headcount of people for the firefighters. He refused to answer any questions from media about the unusual living arrangements as he got into a car with detectives on Wednesday morning. A man who kept his bus parked on the property said he had no idea backpackers were living on site.'It's a bit of a shock,' said the man, who called himself Sam. Fire crews are seen mopping up after a fire ripped through a bus and caravan storage depot in an industrial area at Alexandria . Inspector Ron James said the fire was extremely intense and fast-moving and posed a serious risk to life. 'The fire was that intense that the firies had to put their bodies between the fire and the people they were rescuing to get them out,' Insp James said. 'It was very intense. It was that intense vehicles were melting on the other side of the car park.' The blaze started at a neighbouring bus depot and quickly spread next door to a NSW Public Works building. It took about two hours for crews to get the fire under control. No one was injured and firefighters spent the morning putting out spot fires hours. It's not yet known what caused the fire. The Department of Immigration is currently investigating whether the people who were living at the depot have valid visas to be in the country. One of the buildings the fire spread to was the 'Stoneyard', a New South Wales Public Works site used for conducting stonemasonry related to the restoration of heritage stone buildings. Firefighters said the blaze was so intense that it melted cars on the other side of the car park . Police remained on the scene throughout the morning putting out spot fires and monitoring the situation .","Fire broke out in Alexandria at 1.40am Tuesday in an industrial complex .

"By . Kate Lyons . Authorities have issued a serious warning about toy chargers being sold across Australia after a remote-controlled toy helicopter was found packaged up with a deadly charger that could cause electrocution or burst into flames. Inspectors from NSW Fair Trading raided Sydney's Paddy's Markets yesterday and found a vendor selling a faulty charger contained within a toy helicopter packet. The 240-volt charger, which plugs into a power point, did not meet Australian safety regulations and could cause death by electrocution or fire, said Fair Trading Electrical Product Safety Expert Lynelle Collins. A toy helicopter was seized at Paddy's Markets by Fair Trading investigators. The packet was found to contain a faulty charger that could be fatal . 'The charger itself is the problem, using the helicopter with a different charger is fine,' Ms Collins told MailOnline. However since the charger is sold as part of a package with the helicopter, the concern is that people may use it without first checking if it is safe to be used. 'Our concern is that you could buy it for you child and the child could be recharging it and cause a spark or fire,' said Ms Collins. 'Electricity is so dangerous, we get complacent with it because we use it all day every day, but a 240-volt will kill someone,' she said.

Right: faulty USB-chargers and travel adaptors were seized from a vendor in Campsie two weeks ago, after it was discovered Sheryl Aldeguer purchased the charger that resulted in her death from the store . The seizure was part of a statewide crackdown on unapproved electrical items following the electrocution death of Sheryl Aldeguer, a nurse and mother-in-two, in Gosford in April due to a faulty phone charger. Department of Fair Trading investigators have raided retailers across New South Wales and targeted vendors in Paddy's Markets after a woman in Wollongong reported that her son bought a cheap USB-charger that had sparked from a store in the markets. The vendor who sold the faulty charger inside the toy helicopter box is being investigated by NSW Fair Trading who will decide if he is issued with an on-the-spot fine of $500 or prosecuted, which could lead to a fine of $87,500 fine and two years' imprisonment.

"By . Kate Lyons . A photo has emerged of a brazen fan of the popular television fantasy series apparently smoking a homemade bong while sitting on a replica of the Iron Throne in Sydney. The photograph, published on Reddit and website Pedestrian TV, was taken at a promotional event for the show in Martin Place in Sydney earlier in the year. The picture comes as Australian fans faced waits of up to five hours for their chance to walk through a Sydney exhibition of items from the HBO show at the Museum of Contemporary Art this week. The exhibition featured not only the Iron Throne, but costumes, weapons and a 'virtual reality' experience that allowed visitors to be become one of the Night's Watch. The event where the man is pictured smoking the bong was from a promotional competition in which the person who posted the best selfie won the replica throne. Scroll down for video .

The selfie competition ran in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane in the lead-up to the premiere of season four. A Foxtel spokeswoman said that the man jumped the barricades surrounding the throne and had his photo taken at the end of the day, after close to 1,000 people had come to Martin Place to get their photographs taken on the throne. 'They were hanging around waiting, but there were a lot of people hanging around, it's Martin Place,' she told MailOnline. 'Basically it was a security breach. [Staff] were packing up, he and his mates had planned it, he jumped the barricade,' she said. 'He took off, but obviously not before the photo taken.'

'I don't know when it was taken, but it had nothing to do with the exhibition,' she said. 'All of our fans have been respectful, our fans wouldn't do anything like that.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Associated  Press Reporter . The Detroit teenager shot dead after she knocked on a man’s door for help in the early hours of the morning last November was scared and disoriented after crashing her car, said one of the last people who saw her alive. Black teenager Renisha McBride was killed around 4.30am on November 2 by white homeowner Theodore Wafer, 54, who shot her through the screen door of his home in Dearborn Heights. One of the last people to see McBride before she her death was Carmen Beasley, who told a Detroit courtroom on Wednesday that said she heard a loud bang outside her suburban home three-and-a-half hours earlier. Carmen Beasley, one of the last people to see Renisha McBride alive, told a Detroit courtroom on Wednesday that the teenager had appeared scared and disoriented when she saw her on the early hours of November 2 . When Beasley went to investigate she she found her husband's parked car had been hit. She called 911 and then went outside to help McBride, she said. 'I told her she was injured and we needed to get an ambulance,' said Beasley. 'I didn’t want to be intrusive, but I knew she was hurt.' Beasley said McBride appeared drunk, confused and was staggering and didn't know her home phone number when she asked for it, reports ABC News. McBride walked away from the scene several times, according to Beasley, and disappeared before an ambulance arrived. Renisha McBride, left, was shot in the face and died on the porch of a Dearborn Heights, Michigan, house after she crashed her car while driving home from a party, her mother Monica McBride, right, cried during her testimony on Wednesday . Defense attorney Cheryl Carpenter holds the front-door screen from Theodore Wafer's home, during the trial in Detroit on Wednesday . Theodore Wafer, the man accused of killing McBride had earlier told the court that he heard her 'boom, boom, boom' at least four separate times before he opened the door and shot her in the face. The pounding caused Wafer to fear for his life, his defense lawyer argued, and made his use of force justifiable under Michigan self-defense law. Wafer claims he acted in self-defense, but prosecutors say his actions were unreasonable. An autopsy found she was drunk and had marijuana in her system. McBride's pounding on the door at such . an early hour led Wafer to think his life was in danger, defense . attorney Cheryl Carpenter told jurors. On trial: Theodore Wafer listens during opening arguments at his trial. He stands accused of second-degree murder . '""People . were trying to get in."" That was reasonable for Ted to believe and . that's what he believed that night,"" Carpenter said, according to the . Detroit Free Press. 'Why? He doesn't have a clue.' McBride . had been smoking marijuana most of the day before she was killed. Her . friend, Amber Jenkins said that McBride had been at her house partying . that night. The pair played drinking games and smoked three blunts . together. Ms Jenkins estimated that McBride had half a fifth of New Amsterdam Vodka - which sells for about $12 to $14. Prosecutor Danielle Hagaman-Clark says Wafer could have called police instead of shooting McBride. Wayne County Assistant Prosecutor Danielle Hagaman-Clark talks while a photo of the shotgun that was used to kill Renisha McBride is displayed in court on Wednesday . Defense attorney Cheryl Carpenter says Wafer feared for his life. But Assistant Wayne County Prosecutor Danielle Hagaman-Clark told jurors that despite the loud noises of McBride knocking on Wafer's door - she was no threat to him and never was. 'There was no prying (of the doors) or no kicking,' she said, according to the Detroit News. The screen door, which Wafer fired through to shoot McBride, was still locked when police arrived. The shooting has stoked racial tensions in Detroit. McBride's family and community activists have compared her death to that of Trayvon Martin - another unarmed black teenager who was shot and killed by a man who claimed self-defense. The jury of 12 and two alternates is made up of seven men and seven women. Four jurors are black.","Renisha McBride, 19, was shot dead after she knocked on Theodore Wafer's door last November .

The incident took place during a segment of the AFL Footy Show in which Newman was wheeled into the studio on a hospital bed wearing pyjamas. As he tried to get off the bed he exposed his genitals - he claims unintentionally. Speaking on Triple M's The Grill Team early on Friday, Newman said he wouldn't apologise for the incident and didn't think it was overly offensive. 'I wasn't aware that anything untoward had happened and um... so I'm not sure what I've apologised for but um... in fact, I'm not apologising,' the Geelong forward-turned-TV-celebrity said.

"By . Candace Sutton . and Nathan Klein . and Rebecca English . The newly deposed Premier of New South Wales has gone missing after being blacklisted from the official welcoming ceremony for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. In an embarrassing turn of events for Sydney's image, Mr O'Farrell was scheduled to greet the royal couple at Sydney airport and the Opera house just four hours after he was deposed from his position as state political leader over a scandal heard in a corruption inquiry over the gift of a (£1,600) $3,000 bottle of red wine. But the state's former leader has gone hiatus since stepping down, with his staff stating they 'have no idea where he is'. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Toughing it out: The newly deposed Premier of New South Wales says he will still greet the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in Sydney this afternoon, just four hours after stepping down as political leader . Duke and Duchess of Cambridge Kate and William are greeted by Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and his wife Margie, among others, upon arriving in Sydney with Prince George this afternoon . Storm in a bottle: Barry O'Farrell and his wife Rosemary (above, right) are due to welcome the Duke and duchess of Cambridge to Australia this afternoon, despite the fact he stepped down as premier of NSW over a scandal involving a $3,000 bottle of Grange Hermitage (above, left) just four hours before the royal arrival . Mr O’Farrell and his wife, Rosemary, were due to take part in the official line-up meeting the Duke and Duchess and their son, as well co-hosting a subsequent reception at Sydney Opera House. When the MailOnline contacted Mr O'Farrell's office this morning to ask whether he would still be attending the ceremony this afternoon, a spokesman said everything was 'businesss as usual'. But it was later revealed the former premier was struck off the guest list following his humiliating public statement after a corruption hearing, which could result in perjury charges. A spokesman for Mr O'Farrell later told the MailOnline they 'weren't quite sure where he is'. 'We have no idea where he is...honestly I wouldn't be able to find out,' the spokesman said. He also said Mr O'Farrell's public relations team, which normally handle media requests, 'didn't want to take any calls until everything has been sorted out'. The debacle didn't seem to faze Kate and Wills - nor their gorgeous eight-month-old Prince George - who stepped off the RAAF B737 at 2.35pm looking thrilled to be in Australia. The couple, who will be in Australia for 10 days, will visit Uluru (Ayers Rock), watch life savers on Manly Bay and visit the world famous Taronga Zoo with George, where a Bilby Enclosure is being named after the little prince. First today, however, was a formal welcome at the airport by Australian Governor General Sir Peter Cosgrove and his wife Lady Cosgrove. The couple will host William, Kate and George at Admiralty House, their official residence in Kirribilli, during their stay in Sydney. Also present was the Governor of New South Wales, Her Excellency Professor the Honourable Marie Bashir, Prime Minister Tony Abbott and his wife, Margie. First stop: Crowds are already gathered at the Sydney Opera House to catch a glimpse pf the royal couple who are due to be greeted by the Barry O'Farrell inside the concert hall just hours after he has stepped down as state political leader . Standing firm: despite resigning as Premier of New South Wales, Barry O'Farrell will still meet the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge this afternoon, although it is unclear how he will be introduced to the royal couple . A political storm had been brewing since Tuesday when Mr O'Farrell appeared as a witness before the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) and denied he had received a bottle of Australia's most famous red wine, Penfolds Grange Hermitage as a gift. The 1959 vintage bottle of Grange had reportedly been given to the Premier by the head of Australian Water Holdings, Nick Di Giromalo, who has links with the family of Eddie Obeid, a corrupt former politician currently under investigation. In evidence before the corruption hearing, Mr O'Farrell denied and his wife Rosemary received the wine in April 2011, saying they had been on holidays that Easter. However, the ICAC traced a telephone call from Mr O'Farrell to Mr Di Giromalo around that time. Both Mr O'Farrell and Rosemary O'Farrell are due to welcome William and Kate to Australia when they touch down at Sydney Airport, and again at a reception at Sydney Opera House before 400 invited guests. Mr O'Farrell's office at the NSW State Parliament told the MailOnline that 'at this stage' the now ex-Premier and his wife planned to go ahead with meeting and greeting the royal couple. It is unclear how Mr O'Farrell and his wife will be introduced to the Duke and Duchess.","Premier Barry O'Farrell banned from welcoming ceremony four hours after resigning .

"By . Rebecca English . The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were branded ‘irresponsible’ last night over a £260 child car seat fitted in Prince George’s official car just hours before his hugely anticipated first royal tour was due to begin. The Maxi-Cosi Tobi safety seat was installed in the ‘royal limo’ for the future king by Plunket, a national charity which provides services and support to parents and young children. At Kate and William’s specific request, a technician from the society installed the seat facing outwards. Scroll down for video . Controversy: Prince George, pictured a day old, will face forwards in the royal limo on the tour Down Under . The Maxi-Cosi Tobi seat has been installed by New Zealand charity Plunket in the family's royal limo . In the UK that would be perfectly acceptable as government guidelines state that babies and infants only need to be carried in rear-facing seats until they can sit up unaided - something eight-month-old George is now able to do - and have exceeded the maximum weight for the seat. But Plunket, which is a hugely influential group locally, is very vocal about its own guidelines which recommend children remain in rear-facing car seats until the age of two. Rear facing seats, it says, significantly reduce the risk of death or injury, protecting the baby’s head, neck and spine even as a toddler. Despite its public stance it proudly issued photographs of its car seat services technician Aethalia O’Connor fitting George’s offending restrainer and saying: ‘If it can’t be installed correctly we need to work out a way we can make it correct. We need to make sure the baby is safe.’ Response to the photograph was immediate with hundreds of parents going online to complain about double standards. Helen Lawrence said on the Plunket Facebook page: ‘They [William and Kate] have made an irresponsible decision about facing their baby forwards in the car.‘ . Michelle Green added: ‘You went against everything you recommended, undoing all your hard work regarding rear facing until two.’ Last night, however, the society was unapologetic. Chief executive Jenny Prince said Plunket’s role was ‘to provide advice and work in partnership with parents’ to make informed decisions that worked best for them.' The charity proudly shared this image of a Plunket employee fitting the chair, despite anger over the direction . Although the young royal, pictured a day old, is legally old enough to face forwards in the UK, the firm's guidelines state a child must be two years old before graduating from rear-facing safety chairs . Until now, the eight-month-old royal has faced backwards on car journeys, and is now old enough to face ahead . He added: ‘’Plunket’s priority is to ensure car seats are installed by qualified car seat technicians to ensure they perform correctly. While Plunket recommend that children stay in rear-facing seats until age two, it is not a legal requirement.’ Plunket spokesman Zac Prendergast said he had spoken to Miss O’Connor, and stressed that the seat was installed ‘in line with the parents’ preferences’. The row is particularly embarrassing as the organisation has organised a meet and greet with other babies of a similar age for Prince George, who will be accompanied by his parents, at Government House in Wellington on Wednesday. In another potentially awkward moment, a leading New Zealand politician also warned yesterday it was ‘inevitable’ the country would become a republic. Former deputy prime minister Sir Don McKinnon, who was also secretary general of the Commonwealth for eight years, said the country had been moving to renounce the Royal Family ‘for a long time’. ‘There are 54 countries in the Commonwealth, only 16 are realms [where the Queen is head of state], and I can tell you now that one Caribbean publicly, and three Caribbean privately, are probably going to give up the relationship with the monarchy when the Queen dies. So it is a diminishing group of countries and the important thing is for us to openly and candidly debate the issue,’ he said. Asked when New Zealand might go down the same road, Sir Don added: ‘I don’t know when....[but] I think it is inevitable. The family have come under fire for overriding the charity's minimum age limit of two years for outward-facing safety seats just hours ahead of touching down in Sydney for their tour of Australia or New Zealand . The couple's private secretary said the tour has been designed with Prince George's comfort in mind . ‘I’m quite certain the royal family understands that completely.’ William, Kate and their son, Prince George, were last night on a flight heading Down Under to begin a landmark three week tour of both New Zealand and Australia, another country where the republican cause is strong. The Mail understands that they were travelling First Class, along with George’s new Spanish nanny, Maria Theresa Turrion Burallo, 43, and a fulsome security detail, on a Quantas flight via Dubai. Tickets cost around £6,300 return. The plane is due to land in Sydney early on Monday morning, allowing the royal party to transfer to a New Zealand Royal Air Force jet which will transport them for the first leg of their tour. The bill for all flights associated with the tour is being met by local taxayers. Although the three week trip, undertaken on behalf of the Queen, has been more than a year in the planning, it has very much been designed with baby George in mind, according to aides. And instead of hawking themselves from city to city, as is customary on overseas royal visits, William and Kate will base their young son in three different ‘hubs’: Wellington, Sydney and Canberra. The family and nanny are currently on board a Qantas flight flying first class to Sydney via Dubai . The arrangement means his doting parents will be able to travel back to see George almost every night - bar a stop-over in Queenstown, New Zealand, and another at Ayers Rock in Australia. ‘It’s a long way to go and [would mean] a long time away from their son,’ the couple’s private secretary, Miguel Head, said earlier this month. ‘The tour has been designed with Prince George’s consideration and comfort in mind. ‘Taking a nine month old on a Royal tour is not a first, but it has not happened in this Royal Family’s context for many, many years so there has been much to think about - as any new parent travelling long distance will recognise.’ Royal aides have warned that George’s scheduled public appearances are open to change given his young age and the fact that no-one knows how he will cope with the long journey and 11-hour time difference. Sources have told the Mail that the little prince is also teething - as well as starting to crawl - which will only add to the unpredictability. But he is, generally, a happy little boy say friends of the couple, who is adept to taking everything in his stride - including, hopefully, the large crowds waiting for their first glimpse of the future king.","Maxi-Cosi Tobi installed in limo by Australian parent support charity Plunket .

"By . Kate Lyons . Andrew Jeffrey Flanagan was sentenced to four years in jail in Texas for a string of offences . The conman-executive who got a six-figure job at Myer after fabricating his CV served time in jail in the early 1990s for a string of serious offences. In 1992, Andrew Jeffrey Flanagan, then known as Jeffrey Wayne Flanagan,  was sentenced to four years in jail for burglary, reckless driving, assault and resisting arrest, The Australian Financial Review reported. Mr Flanagan, believed to be from Arkansas, pleaded guilty to the offences in a Texas court and was later paroled by the Dallas County Sheriff's Office. It is not known how long he served in jail. The jail term came after he had been on probation for offences related to the illegal use of credit cards, The Australian Financial Review reported. Mr Flanagan, was fired from Myer last week, on his first day as general manager of strategy and business development after the company discovered he had lied on his resume. He claimed he had held the position of managing director and vice-president of Asia Pacific for Inditex, the Spanish company that owns popular fashion chain, Zara. However, Inditex contacted Myer on Monday, just hours after Mr Flanagan started work at the company, to inform Myer that Mr Flanagan had never worked for them. This was not the first time Mr Flanagan had committed the deception. He was reported to the police in January after he was fired from the Australian Arab Chamber of Commerce and Industry (AACCI) for providing references and credentials that turned out to be false. Mr Flanagan was introduced to Myer by Quest Personnel and it is unclear how he duped the recruitment company who claimed they interviewed him several times as well as conducting international and local reference checks. Mr Flanagan currently lives in Melbourne with his family. Myer hired Mr Flanagan as general manager of strategy and business development and he began working for the company on Monday, but was fired before the end of the day . Myer CEO Bernie Brooks was not the only one to be fooled, several other companies considered Mr Flanagan for roles at their companies on the basis of his falsified resume .","Andrew Flanagan was fired from a six-figure job at Myer last week for fabricating his CV .

"By . Rebecca English . With a private jet and helicopter at their beck and call and al fresco dining at 3,500 metres (11,500 feet), it was the kind of weekend even Prince Harry is likely never to forget. Further details of the royal’s controversial - and, clearly, very lavish - ski holiday to Kazakhstan emerged yesterday and are unlikely to sit comfortably with human rights campaigners who have already condemned the trip. Friends of the fourth in line to throne have openly boasted about their four-day jaunt, even posting pictures from inside their plane on social media. Scroll down for video . The royal couple: Cressida Bonas and Harry in Kazakhstan, with his police protection officer behind them . Polar explorer Inge Solheim, who organised the weekend, shared an image of his pretty wife, Anna, toasting the experience from the comfort of her leather-lined seat on Instagram he bragged: ‘Anna looks very happy for the “upgrade” from Ryanair this weekend : - ) #adventure #backtoreality’. His wife replied: ‘Best weekend ever : - )’ and Tweeted from the flight: ‘Amaaazing weekend. Feeling blessed.’ Another member of the party posted a picture of an opulent private mountain-side lunch, with furs thrown over their chairs and woven rugs placed on the grass. Amnesty International has accused the Queen’s grandson of exercising poor judgement by holidaying in a country with such an appalling human rights record. The country’s despotic president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, has been accused of torturing and killing political opponents, stifling press freedom and profiteering from his country’s vast reserves of oil and gas. Kensington Palace have refused to comment on the prince’s ‘private’ trip or discuss who bankrolled it, although sources close to the prince insist he was merely ‘tagging along’ after being invited by friends. The Czech model: Tereza Maxova is the girlfriend of Turkish-born property developer Burak Oymen, who has made millions from luxury developments in the country and is believed to have paid for the trip . However the Mail understands that it was paid for by Turkish-born property developer Burak Oymen, who has made millions from luxury developments in the country. It is understood that Mr Oymen, who lives in Monaco but has homes in several countries, sent his private plane to London to collect Harry, 29, his girlfriend of two years, Cressida Bonas, as well as Norwegian-born Mr Solheim and his wife. His long-term partner, Czech model Tereza Maxova, later published a picture taken during the weekend of a lavish picnic with the caption: ‘Shashlik [a type of Russian kebab] at 3,500m.’ Mr Oymen, 40, is the son of a senior Turkish politician and co-founder of commercial real estate developers Capital Partners. He and his business partner, Serzhan Zhumashoc, who himself has close links with the controversial Kazakh ruler, President Nazarbayev, own the ski resort of Shymbulak where Harry stayed. In a recent interview he boasted how he wished to turn the once down-at-heel Soviet downhill ski training centre into the ‘Courcheval of Kazakhstan’. Sources close to the prince flatly deny any links between Harry and Mr Oymen and say he had never met him before the trip and has no plans to meet him again, despite his lavish hospitality. Anna Solheim, the wife of polar adventurer Inge Solheim, who organised the weekend . Feast your eyes: Fur throws for a lunch at 11,500ft. Another member of the party posted a picture of an opulent private mountain-side lunch . But having the Queen’s grandson grace the developer’s fledging ski resort with his presence will clearly do little harm to its public image. Mr Oymen was also behind the building of Kazakhstan’s first luxury goods mall and hotel development which opened last year in a blaze of publicity. The property mogul flew out supermodel Eva Herzigova for the champagne-laced occasion which brought firms including Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Armani to the oil-rich Kazakhstani elite. Calls to his office in Almaty were not being answered yesterday. The man behind the holiday is respected 41-year-old adventurer Inge Solheim, who recently led Prince Harry on a charity trek to the South Pole for the Walking With The Wounded charity, which supports injured service personnel. The prince’s team included several seriously injured servicemen and women and a documentary on the team’s remarkable achievement recently aired on ITV. His glamorous wife, Anna, who works as a luxury brand social media manager, posted a series of pictures taken during their weekend on the internet. All are on freely accessible sites. One showed the royal party boarding the Government-owned helicopter that chauffeured them to and from the slopes each day saying: . ‘First attempt at #helli-skiing. Eek! 4100 meters up. #altitudesickness.’ Prince Harry was attacked by human rights campaigners for taking a private jet to enjoy a weekend's skiing in Kazakhstan . Pose: Harry was happy to take photographs with members of the public while skiing . She also shared a video she had shot from inside the former Soviet military helicopter showing her husband and what appears to be Prince Harry skiing toward her, with the words: ‘Waiting in the #chopper for hubbie to appear over the horizon #heliski’. As recently as Sunday there was another ‘selfie’ showing her tucking into some delicacies picked up during the trip. The caption read: ‘eating #caviar from #kazakhstan with salmon & cream cheese #2spoiltgirls’. Mr Solheim’s spokesman did not return calls yesterday. Another photograph from the weekend, which emerged yesterday, shows Harry and his girlfriend accompanied by one of the prince’s most trusted personal protection officers. The same officer was pictured with him in a Jacuzzi on the prince’s notorious holiday to Las Vegas where he was photographed playing a game of naked billiards in a hotel suite. Local reports say the couple were met at their private jet by the ski resort manager, and stayed in a ‘cosy cottage’ close to the main slope. The couple also enjoyed hiking and glacier climbing and on their last day flew to the Dmitiev Glacier for a spot of heli-skiing.","Friends of fourth in line to throne openly boasted about four-day jaunt .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . The New Jersey Turnpike Authority wants a Florida pizza shop to pay a big toll for using a logo similar to the Garden State Parkway's green and yellow signs. The agency sued Jersey Boardwalk Pizza, which is 1,300 miles from New Jersey, Tuesday in federal court over the logo it uses for its two pizza shops and on merchandise sold online. It said in the suit that the company is trying to trade upon the fame of the Garden State Parkway logo to attract customers and potential franchisees. 'It’s hysterical - we’re all the way in the Florida Keys,' restaurant owner Skip Parratt, a former New Jersey resident, told The Star-Ledger. 'It’s not like people are going to confuse us.' Notice the difference? The New Jersey Turnpike Authority is suing a Florida pizza shop claiming its sign is just too similar to the trademark for the Garden State Parkway . JoyAnn Kenny, a lawyer with the Red . Bank-based firm of Marks & Klein LLP, which represents the company, . defended its use of the logo in a letter to turnpike authority lawyers . included in the suit. She wrote that there's no way anyone would confuse . a highway and a pizza place that far from each other. 'Given the very distinct difference in the goods and services offered by our respective clients (yours being a governmental agency providing highway maintenance and travel related services exclusively in the state of New Jersey — ours being a franchisor of pizza restaurants providing the opportunity to provide delicious pizza and Italian food to patrons of its licensed restaurants), there is no plausible likelihood of confusion,' she wrote. The turnpike authority sued over two logos, one used by the pizza business and one by a franchising business it owns. Kenny said that logo for the restaurants was approved by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and has been used since April 2011. New Jersey says that 'there is no question' that the logos 'were directly copied and appropriated from Plaintiff's famous Garden State Parkway Logo.' It asked a judge to require the company to stop using the logos and to destroy any merchandise that includes it. It calls the Garden State Parkway one of the most iconic and well known highways in the country. Its logo includes a green map of the state with a line showing the highway on a yellow background with the words 'Garden State Parkway' written in yellow on a green background. Jersey Boardwalk Pizza also includes a green map of the state and its title written in yellow on a green background. Far from home: This is Jersey Boardwalk Pizza in the Florida Keys. Shop owner Skip Parratt says it's 'hysterical' that authorities in New Jersey would sue him for having a similar logo .","The New Jersey Turnpike Authority believes people might confuse Jersey Boardwalk Pizza's logo with its green and yellow signs .

'The great thing about here is it connects - people feel part of what's going on. We are all going to die. 'There is no mystery behind it, and many of us die of cancer. My father died of cancer. Many people have got grandparents or parents with cancer. 'To have this change in the way in which it is treated from when my dad died in 1965 and now is just extraordinary. 'The word cancer wasn't used - the Big C. Now people talk about it. The thing is to make it part of all our lives and part of living and I think that's what this place achieves.

The cocky snapshot shows the college gunslinger lying in bed with a blood-stained gauze wrapped around his right throwing shoulder. It came only hours after a terrifying car theft that he thought might end his life. ‘I had a gun pointing in my face, so I opened the door, got out, put my hands up to surrender, to give them what they wanted, but they knocked me down, kicked me and punched me,’ said Flemming.

'It was such a chaotic ... fluid . situation, really one of the most dangerous, tense situations that a . police officer could go through,' he continued. 'The firing never stopped. They were . trying to kill (the officers), no doubt. There was a lot on the line and . the officers responded appropriately.'

"By . Ryan Gorman . Four people are dead and another 29 were wounded in yet another violent weekend of shootings across Chicago. The deceased include a 28-year-old man executed in broad daylight on a busy street in view of a city politician, another man shot dead in front of his mother and two other men shot in the head, police said. The wild weekend was then capped off with nine people among a fight of nearly 50 arrested for fighting at a popular beach and throwing beer bottles at responding officers, authorities said.

Cold-blooded: Eric Vaughn (left) faces several charges in the Saturday afternoon shooting death of William Lewis (right) on a busy North Side street that occurred in sight of a city politician . William Lewis, 28, was shot dead in front of dozens of horrified witnesses - including a city Alderman - on the relatively safe North Side. Lewis was standing on the bustling West Devon Avenue commercial strip surrounded by families and Saturday shoppers around 3.30 p.m. when a male casually walked up and shot him in the back, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. Alderman Joe Moore was among those enjoying the peaceful afternoon when he saw the shooter gun down Lewis. ‘This was a bustling commercial strip and it was the last thing I was expecting to see,’ Moore told WLS. ‘Until you do that, you don't really realize how incredible and how senseless it is.’ He and a number of others scrambled away to safety, but saw an even more sobering sight only a few hours later. ‘By . the time we came back to the scene, one of the residents of the . building immediately adjacent to the sidewalk was out there with a brush . and water and bleach cleaning the sidewalk,’ said Moore. ‘That's something no one should have to do, not in any neighborhood in this city.’ Senseless: Lewis and his wife had moved to the neighborhood only two weeks ago .

He was talking about having children,’ friend Warren Radar told the paper. ‘Everything was going right for him.’ The couple would have celebrated their two-year wedding anniversary at the end of the month, according to Radar. ‘He . was excited to be in Chicago,’ Radar continued. ‘His death is . absolutely unnecessary. Chicago is getting a real bad rap for this. It’s . getting way too common.’ Chicago Police announced Monday the arrest of 31-year-old Eric Vaughn. He . was charged with first-degree murder and a number of other counts . related to his attempted getaway, according to a CPD news release. Drive-by shooting: Police believe the one person killed and three wounded in this West Side shooting at a pizzeria were injured by a gunman shooting from a moving car .

Another of the shootings happened early Saturday morning when a mother and son got into an argument with a 47-year-old male while all three were in a South Side apartment, police told the Sun-Times.

Former '30 Rock' star Tracy Morgan has spoken for the first time since leaving a rehabilitation facility for serious injuries he suffered in a car crash that left a fellow comedian dead. The 45-year-old flashed a grin and a peace sign to photographers as he left his Cresskill, New Jersey, home earlier this week in a black Lincoln Navigator. The smiling comedian and actor told reporters gathered outside the property: 'I’m OK, I feel strong,' according to the New York Daily News. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Going home: Tracy Morgan seen for the first time after spending more than a month in a hospital and a rehab facility following a car crash on the NJ Turnpike involving a Walmart truck . 'Love you, thank you very much. Appreciate it,' he told the crowd. The former 'Saturday Night Live' star was considerably thinner and sported a scar on his right temple. Still, he appeared in much better spirits than in earlier pictures despite needing the aide of a walker to get to the SUV before setting out for the afternoon.

Morgan is suing Wal-Mart over last . month's highway crash that seriously injured him and killed a fellow . comedian. The lawsuit, filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in New . Jersey, claims Wal-Mart was negligent when a driver of one of its . tractor-trailers rammed into Morgan's limousine bus. The . complaint claims the retail giant should have known that its driver had . been awake for over 24 hours and that his commute of 700 miles from his . home in Georgia to work in Delaware was 'unreasonable.' It also alleges . the driver fell asleep at the wheel. Not guilty plea: Kevin Roper (leaving court on June 11), a Wal-Mart truck driver from Georgia, was charged with death by auto and four counts of assault by auto on the New Jersey Turnpike on June 7 . 'As . a result of Wal-Mart's gross, reckless, willful, wanton, and . intentional conduct, it should be appropriately punished with the . imposition of punitive damages,' according to the complaint.

A Walmart truck driven by Kevin Roper crashed into the limo bus and the . driver pled not guilty to charges of death by auto . Devastating damage: Investigators have released images that show the extent of the damage to the Mercedes Benz limo van Morgan was riding in when the accident happened . 'We . know it will take some time to resolve all of the remaining issues as a . result of the accident, but we're committed to doing the right thing . for all involved,' Wal-Mart said.

"By . Ryan Gorman . A four-month old baby is dead and her father is being held in jail on a $1million bond. Halo Stutzman, of South Bend, Indiana, died Sunday morning after spending two days on life support as a result of what police believe is a series of beatings from father Bryan Michel. The newborn had skull fractures, a traumatic brain injury, bleeding behind the eyes, bruises all over her body and broken ribs at different stages of healing, according to an affidavit. Write caption here . Authorities say Michel, 22, originally lied about the tot’s injuries, saying another child – who is 18 months old – pulled Halo off the couch and caused the injuries, WSBT reported, citing the affidavit. He then recanted the tale when told of the severity of Halo’s injuries to say he dropped and accidentally fell on the baby while her a bath. She then slowly began to die of suffocation as Michel waited two days to call police because he was afraid he would get in trouble. Dominique Stutzman, the baby’s mother, works nights and was not at home Wednesday night when the fatal injuries are believed to have occurred, said police. Write caption here . Dead too soon: Halo died before even reaching her first birthday . The five-foot eight-inch tall, 150-pound Michel was watching the now deceased baby and Stutzman’s two other children while she worked. A medical exam when the baby was finally brought to the hospital revealed the extent of her injuries and Michel was arrested on a felony charge of neglect. The prosecutor has since said in a statement that Halo died from ‘oxygen deprivation to the brain.’ The helpless child suffocated to death. Officials told WSBT that Michel’s bail was set at $1million because a warrant for a previous charge was issued for his arrest only days before Halo was rushed to the hospital. House of horrors: The home shared by Michel and Dominique Stutzman - when he is believed by police to have severely abused the baby until she died . But a search of St. Joseph County criminal records showed only a 2011 traffic infraction for failure to yield and a March arrest for failure to pay child support. He posted a $2,000 bond and was released from jail the same day. Friends of the baby’s mother posted pictures of the abused tot on their Facebook pages asking for prayers for the young girl. Others set up a ‘Justice for Halo’ page with pictures of the young girl and several comments from those close to the family. Dominique Stutzman notably ‘liked’ a comment from one person saying to ‘FRY THE B*****D IN HELL’ – a reference to Michel. Indiana once used the electric chair for capital punishment, but currently uses lethal injection. A GoFundMe page has also been set up in the baby’s name to help with costs surrounding her death. Authorities have scheduled an autopsy for Monday, but have not said whether the charges against Michel will be upgraded in light of Halo passing away.","Halo Stutzman died at an Indiana hospital after two days on life support .

"By . Ryan Gorman . A rookie Jersey City cop was shot in the head and killed by a man witness say had no plans to rob the store and wanted to kill police so he could become famous. Melvin Santiago, 23, died instantly early Sunday morning after Lawrence Campbell, 27, took the gun from an armed security guard at a Walgreen’s and shot the officer before he could even get out of his squad car. Campbell was gunned down seconds later by cops on the scene. Santiago was a lifelong resident of the northern New Jersey city directly across the Hudson River from lower Manhattan and had only last year graduated from Hudson County Community College with a degree in criminal justice. Heroic death: Jersey City Police Officer Melvin Santiago was gunned down by Lawrence Campbell, a man with multiple drug convictions and suspected in a previous homicide . Campbell, also from Jersey City, stabbed then beat the security guard before remarkably apologizing to a customer for his behavior, WCBS reported. 'Watch the news later, I'm going to be famous!' Campbell told the woman, Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said during a Sunday press conference. The gunman then began firing on the cops as they arrived only minutes later. Police said Sunday that Campbell had also been linked to a previous homicide in the city. 'This guy deserves nothing, his name should be forgotten,' the slain officer's mother, Cathy McBride, told the New York Post. 'Don’t give him any notoriety,' she continued. 'He killed my son. My son was 23 and a good kid and didn’t deserve to get a bullet in his head doing his job, all because someone wanted to be famous.' Santiago was on the police force less than one year, and his family claimed to the New York Daily News that he was living a childhood dream. 'He’s been dying to be a police officer. His uncle was also a police officer; this is what he wanted to do,' aunt Aggie Hernandez told the paper. 'He was just an amazing person. He was our baby.' Riddled: A Jersey City Police Department cruiser is seen with 13 bullet holes on the windshield at the scene . The suspect: The gunman was wearing burgundy sweatpants, according to a witness, his body was lstill on the ground hours after he killed Officer Santiago . Police were called to the 24-hour Walgreen’s about 10 blocks from the city’s Journal Square neighborhood just after 4.00 a.m., WABC reported. Reports . differ as to whether Santiago was driving or a passenger, but what is . clear is that he was shot as he was about to exit the vehicle. Newspaper delivery person Jean Belviso told the New York Daily News she saw the man, wearing burgundy sweatpants and a baseball cap, walk calmly out of the store. Also wanted: Police are also searching for Daniel Wilson, who they believe was involved in a previous homicide with Campbell . He then began shooting as Santiago’s police cruiser arrived in the parking lot, she added. ‘We thought he was running, coming toward us,’ said Belviso. ‘He kept on shooting.’ Belviso reported seeing bullets fly through the squad car’s windshield. One of them fatally struck Santiago in the head, others shattered the car’s rear window. Images from the scene showed 13 bullet holes in the car's windshield. 'He was a great guy, he always looked out. Even if you did something bad, he’ll teach you. He taught me a lot,' 12-year-old cousin Jeramiah Hernandez told the Daily News. 'The last time I spoke with him was after his graduation we went to Appleby’s and we celebrated,' the distraught young boy continued. 'That was the last time I saw him.' Family told the paper he had only graduated from the police academy a few months ago. City payroll records show he was hired by the department July 15, 2013. Friend Gary Narwold told the Post Santiago was a 'great guy who loved what he did. 'He wanted to work the West District, which is known around here as the Wild, Wild West.' Another friend identified only as Baruti told the Post that his pal 'was proud to be a cop — it was what he always wanted to do.' Campbell was an ex-con with multiple drug convictions and prison stints, criminal records showed. His most time behind bars came to an end this past January. That sentence ended two months of freedom after a previous three-year term. Where it happened: The suspect fled this Walgreen's after mercilessly beating an armed guard and stealing his gun . Shut down: John F. Kennedy Boulevard, one of the city's busiest streets, was closed for hours after the shooting . Ashley . Etienne, a 17-year-old niece of security guard Pierre Monsanto, says her . uncle was severely injured in the attack that resulted in the suspect . taking his gun. ‘We don't know what happened, but he was badly beaten,’ she told the Jersey Journal. Fulop called it ‘a horrible day’ for the city during a Sunday morning press conference. ‘It . is a tragic situation when any officer is killed in the line of duty,’ Fulop continued. ‘Melvin was an officer who represented everything one . would want to see in a police officer. ‘I know the entire city's thoughts and prayers are with the Santiago family during this difficult time and we mourn together.’ The shooter’s dead body remained on the ground more than four hours after police shot him dead, he has yet to be identified. Show of solidarity: Dozens of cops from both the Jersey City Police Department and the Port Authority Police remained outside Jersey City Medical Center in the hours after Santiago was pronounced dead at the hospital . Officers gathered Sunday morning outside Jersey City Medical Center, where Santiago was pronounced dead, in a show of support for their fallen comrade. Walgreen’s said no customers or employees were harmed in the incident. The store has a security guard because of the high crime rate of the area it is in, only blocks from the notoriously crime-ridden, gang-infested Greenville neighborhood. 'My God, it sounded like fireworks,' a local resident identified only as Mike told the paper. 'The amount of shots, and so fast, like 'pow, pow, pow, pow!' 'And then I heard the sirens. Those shots went on forever. I really thought it was fireworks,' Mike continued. 'There's no big staff in there at that time of the night in the Walgreen's... I wouldn't go in there late at night..' Multiple calls and a message left by MailOnline for further comment from Jersey City police went unanswered.","Officer Melvin Santiago, 23, was shot in the head by a suspect in the botched robbery of a 24-hour store .

"By . Julian Robinson . Daniel Spargo-Mabbs died from a heart attack after taking ecstasy at a rave . A man accused of selling a lethal dose of ecstasy was cleared today after saying he could not have been the cycling dealer because he looked ‘stupid’ on a bike. Ryan Kirk, 21, was acquitted of supplying MDMA to 16-year-old Daniel Spargo-Mabbs, who suffered three heart attacks after he overdosed on half a gram diluted in water in January this year. The teenager died three days after an illegal rave in Croydon, south London, having assured his mother, ‘I love you, Mum. I promise I won’t die,’ before he left. Mr Kirk had been accused of acting as a ‘mule’ for dealer Nicqueel Pitrora, meeting Daniel and four friends behind warehouses in Croydon, south London. But while Pitrora pleaded guilty to supplying the killer substance, the case against Mr Kirk was based on a single teenager’s ‘weak’ identification of the supposed culprit, based on their twenty-second encounter. The jury was shown footage of the identity parade and had asked to see the films for a second time just minutes before returning their not guilty verdicts. The video shows an officer asking the teen witness - who cannot be named - if he has made a positive identification based on the mugshot of Mr Kirk. The teen, supported by his mother, faintly replies, ‘Yes’, but had apparently failed to understand the question. He then asks, ‘Do I have to be certain? If I have to be certain, then no.’ But he signed a form confirming Kirk was indeed the suspect. Giving evidence, Mr Kirk said he could not have dropped off the drugs by bike since he had not ridden one since he was ‘16 or 17’. ‘I think I look stupid on a bike, I’m pretty lanky,’ he told jurors. A mountain bike belonged to his best friend but was usually unchained outside Ryan Kirk’s house and could be used by anyone, jurors heard. Four days later he was arrested at a party in his neighbour’s home. ‘I never dealt any drugs to anybody’, he maintained. Today a jury of seven men and five women cleared Mr Kirk of being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs on 17 January this year. Prosecutor Tyrone Silcott had admitted . the line-up identification was ‘weak’, although the boy later told the . court in person he was ‘80 percent sure’ he had got it right. The . heard how Daniel and his friends had clubbed together £80 to spend on . the party-drug to take at an illegal rave at a former cotton factory in . Hayes. Daniel fell unconscious after consuming MDMA at the event which was attended by 3,000 revellers. The court heard Daniel took off his shirt after taking the drugs and was 'talking a lot more than he usually does', including talking about his girlfriend . He had sprinkled around half a gramme of the crystalline powder into 500ml of water and drunk it all at once after he was admitted inside the warehouse. Shortly afterwards Daniel took his shirt off, became animated about his girlfriend and started to dance. By 4am his temperature had soared and he collapsed unconscious on the floor. He was rushed to Hillingdon hospital by paramedics but nothing could be done to save him. The teenager who was a pupil at Archbishop Tenison’s School in south London, died at King’s College Hospital three days later after being admitted to the specialist liver unit for emergency surgery. A toxicology report showed traces of MDMA in his blood. The bright sixth-form student had dreamed of joining the army or becoming an English teacher before the lethal deal was struck with a dealer named ‘Shampz’ - whose real name is Nicqueel Pitrora. Mr Kirk, Beckenham, Kent, was cleared of being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs on 17 January. He . was further found not guilty of being concerned in the supply of Class A . drugs between 1 January 3013 and 16 January 2014 and being concerned in . the supply of Class B drugs over the same period. Earlier . this week Pitrora, of London Road, Croydon, admitted being concerned in . the supply of a Class A drug, being concerned with the supply of . cannabis and simple possession of cannabis. Pitrora will be sentenced on 1 August. Ryan Kirk, 21, from Beckenham, South London, was charged with being concerned in supplying a controlled drug of class A - MDMA to Daniel (pictured) but has been cleared by a jury . Later Daniel’s parents, Tim and Fiona Spargo-Mabbs said in a statement: ‘Daniel was an incredible boy and an incredible son, who we loved with all our hearts, who made a very bad decision on 17 January. ‘Over the course of the next three days in January, we had to watch him slowly die as the drug had caused everything inside him to stop functioning. ‘We would willingly have given our lives in place of his if we could, and when Daniel died part of us also died. ‘As a family with a massive gaping hole now in our centre, we’re slowly trying to rebuild our lives into whatever our ‘new normal’ will be, but we’ve barely begun and have a very long and very hard road ahead of us.’ The family went on to appeal to those responsible not to ‘waste the rest of their lives continuing to sell drugs to schoolchildren, and playing their part in the damage, destruction and death of other people’s children’. ‘We believe very strongly that Dan is safe with God and that we will bring him once again and this does bring hope,’ the family added. ‘But the despair remains in having to walk through each day of the rest of our lives without him, because of this one bad decision. ‘The people who supplied the drugs have choices remaining to them, and the rest of their lives in which to make them, and we will continue to pray that they choose to use them for good.’","Daniel Spargo-Mabbs died after taking drugs at a warehouse party in Hayes .

"By . Ryan Gorman . A suburban Toronto father is believed by police to have killed his two sons and committed suicide after their charred bodies were found last week in a burned-out car north of the city. Samuel Masih, 36, was found last Friday near Barrie, Ontario, with sons Tyrese, 10, and four-year-old Santosh, after their mother filed a missing persons report when they failed to come home – marital problems are believed to be what drove the man over the edge. Masih confided earlier this year with neighbors that he and and wife Brintha Shanmugalingam were headed for divorce, they told The Mississauga News. Grim ending: Tyrese and Santosh Masih (left) and father Samuel Masih (right with an unidentified child) were found 'charred beyond recognition' in a burned-out car in suburban Toronto . ‘He said it was going to be hard on the kids, but that he was hoping everything would be okay,’ a man identified only as Brandon told the paper. The revelation came one week after police found the scorched vehicle at the end of a remote cul-de-sac about one hour north of Toronto. Officers were shocked to find three bodies ‘charred beyond recognition’ inside the car, and it took an autopsy to identify the remains, according to reports. The fire burned so intensely that it even melted the vehicle identification number, police told the Toronto Star. ‘Because of the burned-out nature of the vehicle, it’s virtually unidentifiable,’ said Ontario Provincial Police Sergeant Peter Leon. ‘It’s a metal shell.’ Charred: The fire burned so intensely the vehicle's VIN melted, and a large soot mark was left behind after the car was removed . The family's home: Masih's wife called police after he and their two children failed to return to their Mississauga home after he told her they were going to a movie . Memorial: Neighbors have been leaving flowers and letters of condolence for the widowed mother . Masih, a psychiatrist, initially told his wife that he and the two boys were going to see a movie around 4.00 p.m. the day before police found the vehicle. She called police when they failed to return by 1.30 a.m. early the next morning, police told the Star.The burning car was discovered only hours later. ‘This is a very, very tragic set of circumstances which has unfolded,’ Leon told the CBC. Neighbors attending a July 9 vigil had a hard time coming to grips with the series of events that led to the grisly find. ‘The Dad just seemed like a normal guy, he’d pick kids up, drop them off, do the shopping,’ Neighbor Claudia Ah-Yen told the National Post. ‘It’s very hard to comprehend.’ Another neighbor who saw Masih hours before he died was unable to talk about the ordeal, saying only ‘I don’t want to talk about it right now.’ A friend of Tyrese Masih told the paper ‘he was nice,’ and went out of his way to make new students feel comfortable. She left the dead fifth grader a note that read ‘you did not deserve this and you are a very sweet boy.’ The boy’s soccer coach called his death ‘shocking.’ Police have declined to comment further on whether marital troubles led Masih to the double murder-suicide, saying only that the family has been through a difficult number of days and reserves their right to privacy.","Samuel Masih, 36, and sons Tyrese and Santosh went missing last Thursday after the father claimed they were going to see a movie .

"By . Julian Robinson . A self-styled lord who led the life of an international playboy while masterminding a huge fraud must repay nearly £14million or face another decade behind bars . Edward - ‘Fast Eddie’ - Davenport, 48, hosted lavish parties at his £10million mansion and boasted of befriending guests including supermodel Kate Moss and Princes William and Harry. But the socialite was exposed as a fraudster who duped victims out of their life savings through bogus start-up loan schemes. Edward Davenport, shown left in a police photo and right at his £10million central London mansion, enjoyed a champagne lifestyle, rubbing shoulders with the rich and famous . The con artist, born Edward Ormus Sharington Davenport, promised millions of pounds which never materialised after he had pocketed the administration fees and advance payments. Princess Diana’s wedding dress designer Elizabeth Emanuel lost the life savings she invested with Davenport. The fraudster, who was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years behind bars in 2011, was not at Southwark Crown Court today to hear the Judge Peter Testar’s ruling. Davenport, who was released from prison on licence in May due to acute kidney problems will also have to find £1,943,620 in compensation in addition to the £12million. Judge Testar said today: ‘Through his dishonesty Edward Davenport has caused harm to many people and it would be an insensitive judge who was not conscious of those whom he had defrauded.’ Edward Davenport, pictured, will now have to sell his central London mansion, at Portland Place, which he bought for a pittance from the Sierra Leone government . The judge lamented the fact Davenport’s victims may never see their cash returned, because of his ‘attrition’ tactics. ‘It . is a very great pity that the legislation does not permit civil . claimants to gain access to funds that have been confiscated. ‘In . the end, and although it might seem harsh to the losers from Edward . Davenport’s crime, I have come to the conclusion to exercise my . discretion so as to make a confiscation order in the full amount of . £12,000,000. ‘There is a risk that civil claims will not come to fruition, or that true to his normal way of conducting matters Edward Davenport will wage a campaign of attrition and wear the claimants down so that they give up or somehow or another he is allowed to hang on to money that he has obtained by fraud. Edward Davenport, pictured before a previous court appearance, must repay £12million or face a decade in jail . ‘In the end, I have decided that the risk of Edward Davenport retaining some of the fruits of his crime is one that my public duty dictates I should not take.’ Davenport will now have to sell his central London mansion, at Portland Place, which he bought for a pittance from the Sierra Leone government. The five-storey, 110-room house was also used for film shoots, a fashion show and a masquerade ball, while his swimming pool was reportedly filled with Cognac so revellers could row through it. Scenes from the Oscar winning film The King's Speech were also filmed there, and Kate Moss was filmed walking down its staircase wearing nothing but stiletto heels and underwear for an Agent Provocateur advert. He enticed his victims with a website boasting of his champagne and sports-car lifestyle and a £100m property portfolio in Britain, Thailand and Monaco. Davenport claimed to be a familiar face in ‘exclusive venues across the world’ and had ‘extensive business interests.’ His web page boasts: ‘Welcome to the website of Edward Davenport, one of London’s most flamboyant and best known entrepreneurs as well as a true English gentleman from an established British family.’ Among the stars Davenport was pictured with on the site’s gallery were actors Hugh Grant, Jeremy Irons, Jude Law and Steve Coogan and music mogul Simon Cowell. Davenport, of Portland Place, central London, was convicted after a trial of conspiracy to defraud. His bill could rise to £15,855,273, if he is ordered to meet both prosecution and defence costs.","Edward Davenport duped his victims through bogus start-up schemes .

"By . Julian Robinson . A gang kicked a Sikh lawyer’s turban off his head in a ‘ferocious’ attack outside St Paul’s Cathedral, a court heard. Rashvinder Panesar and his wife Sundeep were on their way home from a meeting of the Society of Asian Lawyers in the City of London when they were set upon. Luxmanan Mahendran, 28, and two other men allegedly shouted ‘let’s kick his turban off’ and ‘kick it away’ as they kicked and punched Mr Panesar in April last year. Rashvinder Panesar, pictured left with wife Sundeep, was attacked outside St Paul's Cathedral, a court heard. Luxmanan Mahendran, right, denies a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm . When Mrs Panesar, also a lawyer, tried to intervene and retrieve her husband’s dislodged turban, she too was grabbed and almost knocked to the ground by Mahendran, the Old Bailey heard. Mr Panesar told the jury that he was kicked to the ground by the three men. ‘My turban came loose and there was a comment made to kick it,’ Mr Panesar said. ‘It came off my head and it was directly kicked.’ He said Mahendran had shouted a sexual comment to his wife - ‘tuck me in baby’. When Mr Panesar confronted him the men became aggressive and threatened to ‘put him to sleep’, the court heard. ‘One of the guys pushed me in the chest,’ he said. ‘All three of them stepped forward. ‘I was kicked to the floor and then when I was on the floor repeatedly kicked in the face, legs, head, my back and the back of my head. ‘This defendant was the most aggressive one, he was the one who instigated the situation and he was the one who pushed me.’ He added: ‘In the ambulance my wife was visibly shaking and traumatised. ‘I didn’t want to be seen without my turban, I find it embarrassing so I tied it back on in the ambulance.’ Rashvinder Panesar and his wife Sundeep were outside St Paul's Cathedral, pictured, on their way home from a meeting of the Society of Asian Lawyers when they were set upon by a group, the court heard . The alleged attack took place in Carter Lane, at around 10.45pm on 26 April 2013. Mr Panesar suffered a fractured nose, a chipped tooth, injured his knee and had one of his contact lens knocked out. He was taken to University College Hospital for treatment and said he still suffers pain from ligament damage to his shoulder. Prosecutor Samantha Cohen said: ‘Mr Panesar on 26 April last year had been attending one of those work-related social occasions. ‘He had been on the organising committee of the organisation running the event. ‘It was at a bar not too far from this court. ‘They left the venue at about 10.30pm heading home because they had to relieve the babysitter. ‘They walked together past St Paul’s trying to get a taxi. ‘The couple came across a group of three men, all Asian, this defendant was one of those men. ‘One of the group made a sexualised comment towards Mrs Panesar. ‘Mr Panesar asked him what he was doing. ‘The three males together then became really quite aggressive swearing at Mr Panesar and his wife. ‘They threatened to ‘tuck him in’ or ‘put him to sleep’. The trial is taking place at the Old Bailey in London, close to where the allleged attack took place, jurors were told . ‘They approached him, pushed him, he was punched and fell to the ground. ‘While on the ground he was punched and kicked by all three of the assailants. ‘He tried to defend himself by punching back but it didn’t have any effect.. ‘The assault was so ferocious that his left contact lens popped out of his eye following one of the kicks to his head. ‘During the course of the assault the turban on his head was kicked off. ‘He suffered swelling and bruising, mainly to his head and face.’ The alleged attack was partly caught on CCTV and two eye witnesses described seeing the victim on the ground being kicked by three men, the court heard. Mahendran was arrested at the scene and told police that Mr Panesar attacked him and his friends as they got out of a taxi. Mahendran, of north London, denies a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The trial continues.

"By . Julian Robinson . A schoolboy who was hit by two cars was left lying in the road by the first driver - before the second began demanding cash for his damaged vehicle. Myles Knowles, 15, was crossing the road on his bike near the Cineworld cinema in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, when he was hit by a white Ford Fiesta, before being thrown into the path of a red Audi. Both cars sped off before the Audi returned and parked nearby. Myles Knowles, pictured, was hit by a Ford Fiesta, before being thrown into the path of a an Audi. He has since received text messages demanding cash for vehicle damages . Teenager Myles Knowles has been sent a series of text messages, left and right, which included threats and demands for cash to repair one of the cars that hit him as he was crossing the road . The driver and two passengers then asked Myles if he was all right before asking for his mobile phone number. Now the teenager, who needed hospital treatment, says that he has been sent several text messages demanding money for repairs to the damaged Audi. One messages urges the youngster to pay up in excess of  £200 for the damage to the car. Another demands money before asking: 'Or shall I call round to see someone?' Mother Carol, 44, rushed to the scene along with police and ambulance crews as the youngster - who was with a friend at the time of the incident - slipped in and out of consciousness at the roadside. He was discharged from hospital around eight hours later and, incredibly, suffered only minor injuries to his legs.

His furious mother, of Ashton-under-Lyne, said she had been 'appalled' by the reaction of the drivers and other motorists. 'It's shocking,' she said. 'Not only did the driver of the first car not stop but the second driver has shown more concern for his own vehicle than Myles' welfare - some of the texts have been quite threatening. 'No other drivers stopped at the scene either. 'Considering a 15-year-old boy had just been hit by two cars you'd have thought someone would at least check to see he was alright. 'It was upsetting seeing him by the side of the road and it was very lucky he wasn't more seriously injured.

'It's a busy area and I'm hoping someone will have seen something at the time which can help the police find the driver who didn't stop.' The New Charter Academy pupil has been on crutches and left unable to eat full meals since the crash. He said: 'I'm still quite shaken up by it all and I can't put any pressure on my legs yet.

"By . Associated Press . and Will Payne In North Conway, New Hampshire . The man charged with kidnapping 15-year-old Abby Hernandez nine months ago is very bright, has strong opinions and thrives on conflict, according to a police officer who had two decades of contact with him. Former Conway Lt Chris Perley, who left the force in April after 29 years, has known 34-year-old Nathaniel Kibby since the kidnapping suspect was 12 years old and was surprised to hear of his arrest. Kibby was arrested at his Gorham trailer Monday and charged with kidnapping Hernandez on October 9, a week before her 15th birthday. Abby returned home July 20, but investigators have been tight-lipped about the details surrounding her disappearance and return. 'Smart, but myopic': Retired Conway, New Hampshire police officer Chris Perley (pictured) has spoken out about his two decades interacting with Abby Hernandez's alleged kidnapper, Nathaniel Kibby . Snatched: Kibby, 34 (left), was arraigned in court last week on charges of kidnapping 15-year-old Abigail Hernandez (right) last October. Abby surprisingly reappeared alive in her hometown of Conway on July 20, nine months after going missing. She attended last week's court hearing and sat in the front row . Perley said his most recent dealing with Kibby was over a summons for running a red light. 'He thought he should be entitled to (run the light) because he went to work at such early hours,' Perley said. 'He was smart, but he was also brutally myopic in whatever view he had,' Perley said. 'You could not shake him or redirect him in the way he saw the world.' Kibby has a lengthy criminal record, including several assaults. Particularly disturbing, Perley said, was an arrest in March when Kibby was charged with criminal trespass and assault after following a Conway woman to her home after a minor car accident. Police said he pushed her to the ground in her driveway after she ordered him to stop taking pictures of her car. Solving the mystery: An FBI agent walks on Nathaniel Kibby's property Thursday, passing in front of a shipping container where he may have kept Abby hidden for nine months . 'I remember thinking that was so over the top,' Perley said. 'You don't go to their home and get into a chest-bumping situation, especially with a woman.' Another victim: Tammy Shackford told MailOnline about her terrifying encounter with Kibby in March, when he shoved her to the ground multiple times over a car accident . The victim of the assault, 55-year-old Tammy Shackford, spoke with MailOnline about the vicious attack that left her with nightmares and shock. Shackford said that she caught Kibby rifling through her damaged truck In March, following weeks of arguments over how much damage he caused in the accident. She says he marched up to her and pushed her to the ground, injuring her elbow. When she got up, he shoved her down again. ‘I was incredibly scared. He has serious issues. I could see it in his eyes, he was crazy,  something really wasn’t right,' she said. The mother-of-one managed to call police and Kibby was found hiding in a neighbor’s garden and arrested. The assault charge was eventually dropped, and Kibby pleaded guilty to criminal trespass on July 23 at Conway Circuit Court - three days after Abby returned home. Kibby grew up in and attended school in Conway, a tourist-dependent town of about 1,800 people in the southeast corner of the White Mountain National Forest. Although he'd lived in Gorham for a while, he returned to Conway to work as a machinist at two gun makers - Green Mountain Rifle Barrel Co. and E.M.M. Precision. Various news outlets have reported he was laid off this year for economic reasons. Kibby was arraigned Tuesday and is being held on $1million cash bond. He's due in court August 12. His public defender, Jesse Friedman, did not return a call seeking comment. Prosecutors have revealed little of what they have learned since Kibby's arrest, saying only that investigators continue to search his home and the surrounding grounds. It remains unclear where Abby was held for more than nine months. She attended Tuesday's brief hearing, wide-eyed but otherwise expressionless, and made no comments. On Thursday, Abby stopped by the offices of the Conway Daily Sun, the newspaper that ran a daily box counting the number of days she had been missing and urging people to call police with any information. Abby's mother, Zenya, told the paper her daughter occasionally saw the box while she was in captivity, and it gave her hope. Back home: On Thursday, Abby (center), her mother Zenya (left) and family friend Amanda Smith (right) stopped by the offices of the Conway Daily Sun. Zenya says her daughter occasionally saw a box the newspaper published counting her days in captivity, saying it gave the teen hope . Daily Sun reporter Daymond Steer said Abby and her mother seemed relaxed during the visit. 'They seemed like they were on the mend,' Steer said. 'They've been through a lot obviously, but she's getting better.' On Friday, it was revealed that police may have missed an opportunity to rescue Abby five months after her disappearance, when they showed up at Kibby's mobile home to collect his vast arsenal of weapons following the assault arrest. Kibby actually called police and invited them to his home to collect the weapons so he would not be in breach of his bail conditions. Official records show two officers went round to his property at 9:04pm on March 2013, stayed for fifteen minutes and then left with his guns. What did they find? Investigators at Kibby's property were photographed on Thursday storing evidence in boxes marked 'biohazard' Their visit raises serious questions as it is believed Abby was held on his tiny property for the entire nine months since her October disappearance. Court documents show Kibby has convictions on four trespassing counts, simple assault, providing false information to obtain a firearm and two counts each of receiving stolen property and resisting arrest. He faces up to seven years in prison if convicted of kidnapping. But Perley said nothing foreshadowed the kidnapping allegations. 'You're always hoping it's some stranger and that evil doesn't live in your midst,' Perley said. 'Certainly nothing he'd ever done would lead you to believe this is what he would do. If it is true, the depravity of the man knows no limits.'","Former Conway Lt Chris Perley has known Nathaniel Kibby, 34, since he was 12 years old .

That . song - La Bestia - has subsequently become a major radio hit in Central . America, with its legion of fans unaware it was created to 'teach' them . something. La . Bestia - translated as The Beast - refers to the notoriously dangerous . freight train that migrants ride from Southern Mexico - risking robbery, . kidnapping, rape, and murder - just to make it to the U.S. border. The track features lyrics such as: 'Migrants from everywhere, entrenched along the rail ties. 'Far away from where they come, further away from where they go.

Happy childhood: Little Abby looks carefree in this photo posted by her father Ruben on his Facebook page . Speculation has raged since Abby reappeared on Sunday July 20, apparently walking back into her North Conway home, wearing the same clothes she was last seen in. Despite arresting Nathaniel Kibby and charging him with kidnapping, the Attorney General’s office has released very little information about the crime. And Mr Hernandez, who is divorced from Abby’s mother Zenya, says he has barely been told anything about his daughter’s abduction. Speaking on Friday the 61-year-old said he had seen her briefly once, but he did not want to push her on where she had been, or what had happened to her. ‘All I can say is I am so happy and relieved Abby is back home’, he said talking to MailOnline. ‘I honestly never thought I was going to see her again. 'I believe it is a miracle that she has come home unharmed. It could have been so much worse. It is an answer to all my prayers.’ He went on: ‘I'm in the dark as much as anyone, I am looking for answers like everyone else. With a cherry on top: Ruben Hernandez reached out to his daughter after she disappeared to tell her how worried he was that she was cold and didn't have a jacket and that she may not have enough food . TLC: 'We have to be very careful as we really have no idea what happened to her,' says Abby's dad . ‘I'm her father, I want to know what happened more than anyone, I'm desperate for answers. How do you think I feel? It's terrible that I don't know what happened to my own daughter. ‘You would have thought I would be kept informed, but I haven't been. I have talked to the police, but they don't know. ‘Even if Abby lived here and even if I had custody the police still wouldn't be able to tell me anything because it's an open investigation.’ He has seen Abby once since July 20, but he says that meeting did not shed any light on the past nine months. ‘The short time I spent with Abby, well, you can tell when not to push someone’, he said. ‘I hope she will let me know what happened when she is ready. ‘We have to be very careful as we really have no idea what happened to her. We don't know if she was hurt. She could just be putting on a brave act. We don't know how she is feeling inside.’ Abby spoke to the media in person for the first time last week when she visited the offices of the newspaper, The Conway Daily Sun, to express her thanks for their commitment to the case. 'I'm taking it a little at a time but I'm feeling a lot better every day,' she told staff. 'I'd just like to be treated like a normal person.' Mr Hernandez, who is president of a company called Structural Solutions, has two daughters with ex-wife Zenya, Abigail and her older sister Sarah. Face of evil? The 34-year-old Nathaniel Kibby was arraigned last week on charges he kidnapped 15-year-old Abigail last October . He splits his time between New Hampshire and Texas, but says he is as involved in his daughters’ lives as possible. When Abigail was missing he wrote a number of open letters on a public Facebook page in a desperate attempt to get her to come home. The first, written in November, started: ‘We don't know if you ran away but if you did, it's important for you to know Sweetheart that nobody is angry with you, and you are not and will not be in any trouble. I just need to know that you are OK. ‘I am very worried that you are out there in the cold, because I don't know if you have a jacket. I am also worried that you may not be eating. I am hoping and praying that you are safe, warm, and that you are eating.’ In a later note, penned six months after Abigail’s disappearance, he seemed to have changed his opinion and said he believed Abgail had run away from home. This was partly based on the fact she had sent her parents a letter soon after her disappearance. Its content has never been revealed. Search: The Fish and Game Conservation K-9 officers walked along the Moose River in Gorham looking for clues . Mr Hernandez offered to take custody of his daughter and wrote: ‘Abby it’s important that you understand my reason for wanting custody. Since a letter was received from you it became obvious that you ran away. And that raises the question what did you run away from? Only you can answer that but I am guessing that you ran away from your home life.’ Explaining the letters he said: ‘If you read them in full, they sum up how I feel.’ He added: ‘I don’t understand how she wrote the letter she did. I want to know.’ Since Nathaniel Kibby’s dramatic arrest on Monday and his arraignment a day later, which saw him placed on $1 million cash bail, a huge amount of scrutiny has been placed on the 34-year-old suspect. Neighbors have described him as a gun-obsessed loner and an odd-ball, who harbored a number of conspiracy theories and regularly talked about an impending, ‘zombie apocalypse’. He also has a lengthy criminal record, for offenses including, theft and criminal trespass, dating back to when he was just 17. Investigation: Police searched Kibby's home but have revealed little about what led them to the accused kidnapper. Butut questions surround a shipping container on the man's Gorham, New Hampshire property, located 30 miles north of where Abigail reappeared . His trailer in Gorham, New Hampshire, about 50 minutes’ drive north of Abigail’s home town of North Conway, has been the subject of an intense search operation carried out by FBI agents, state troopers and local police officers. They have also been scouring a storage container, kept in his back yard. It is believed he may have held Abigail captive in the container, which is thought to be sound-proofed and to have three separate rooms. Neighbors have even suggested Kibby may have dug a tunnel to connect his trailer to the container. Mr Hernandez says he has no idea about who Kibby is, but he is obviously determined to find out about the man who allegedly kidnapped him beloved daughter. He said: ‘I have never heard of Nathaniel Kibby, all I know is what I have read. But I want to know about him.’ He finished, saying: ‘I would tell every parent to keep such a close eye on their children, especially when they are teenagers. People will just have to be patient and the truth will eventually come out.’","Abby's dad Ruben Hernandez, who is divorced from her mother Zenya, tells MailOnline he has seen Abby once since she returned home .

"By . Julian Robinson . He was reduced to floods of tears after his team was thrashed 7-1 by Germany on home soil in a result that broke Brazilian hearts. But after Brazil captain David Luiz wept uncontrollably in the wake of his team’s devastating capitulation in the World Cup semi-finals, he has received some welcome support – in the form of an adorable letter from a young fan. The former Chelsea defender, wearing the skipper’s armband in the absence of Thiago Silva, cried as he said ‘I just wanted to see my people smile’ after Brazil’s hopes of winning the tournament on home turf were dashed in humiliating fashion. Brazil's David Luiz, pictured left, wept after his side was thrashed 7-1 by Germany in the World Cup semi-finals . Ana Luz, nine, sent David Luiz this touching letter urging the multi-million pound defender not to be too sad in the wake of Brazil's humiliating defeat . But his show of emotion after the final whistle had blown, prompted nine-year-old Ana Luz to pen him a letter - telling him not to be sad. The child even showed he was still her sporting hero by drawing a small picture of him holding a trophy aloft. Luiz, 27, who left Chelsea for Parish St Germain earlier this summer, was so touched by the letter that he posted it on Instagram. He wrote: ‘Many thanks princess Ana Luz, loved your letter! 'And thanks to all Brazilians for all the support! David Luiz, pictured left with Thiago Silva, was so touched by Ana Luz's letter of support that he posted it on Instagram . 'I'll never give up my dreams, and I will always strive to give back all that love I receive! God bless you all!’ In her letter, she explained that she had watched all of Brazil’s games and ‘liked it a lot watching you play’. She added: ‘I think that you don't need to be sad because you played well and did the best you could. You were a great captain. Hi David Luiz,My name is Ana Luz. I saw all of the Brazil games in the World Cup and I liked it a lot watching you play. I think that you don't need to be sad because you played well and did the best you could. You were a great captain. Life is like this, sometimes people lose and sometimes people win but people only need to be happy. David Luiz, you are my champion. Ana Luz Penna Reale . ‘Life is like this, sometimes people lose and sometimes people win but people only need to be happy. ‘David Luiz, you are my champion.’ Germany blew Brazil away in a sensational 18-minute spell in the first-half that yielded five goals - two from Toni Kroos and one apiece for Thomas Muller, Miroslav Klose and Sami Khedira. Klose's goal saw him overtake Brazil legend Ronaldo as the leading goalscorer in World Cup tournaments, with 16 now to his name. Substitute Andre Schurrle added two further goals after the break to extend the lead to seven, before Oscar scored a late consolation. Brazil’s World Cup campaign will come to an end tonight after they face the Netherlands in a third place play-off at the Estadio Nacional in Brasilia. The tournament finally reaches its climax tomorrow when Argentina take on Germany in the Maracana Stadium, Rio de Janeiro.","Brazil's David Luiz left in tears after 7-1 defeat to Germany in the World Cup .

"By . Julian Robinson . A 21-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the death of 53-year-old grandmother Jean Campbell, pictured . A man has been arrested in connection with the death of a grandmother - almost seven months after her body was found in a park. Jean Campbell, 53, was last seen heading towards Cranhill Park while walking her dog within sight of her home in the east end of Glasgow on Friday December 13. Her body was discovered the next morning by her husband who, on returning from his night shift, realised she was not home and went to look for her. The family's German Shepherd Kai was found in the park. Police said the 53-year-old had suffered a particularly violent attack and a reconstruction of the case featured on the BBC's Crimewatch programme. A 21-year-old man has now been arrested in connection with her death, police said today. A second man, aged 22, has also been arrested in connection with allegedly attempting to pervert the course of justice in relation to the investigation. A Police Scotland spokesman said: 'Following a police operation in Glasgow, Friday July 11, a 21-year-old man has been detained and subsequently arrested in connection with her death. 'He is presently detained in police custody. 'A second man, aged 22 years, also from Glasgow, was detained and has been arrested in connection with allegedly attempting to pervert the course of justice in relation to this investigation. 'He too is presently detained in police custody.' A report is to be sent to the procurator fiscal. More than 1,500 DNA samples have been taken during the investigation into Mrs Campbell's death. In the days following her death police released CCTV images showing the final minutes of her life. CCTV images show the final minutes of a 53-year-old mother's life before she was brutally murdered while walking her dog. Jean Campbell was last seen walking towards Cranhill Park, pictured, in Glasgow on December 13 last year . The footage was captured at 2230 hours on Friday 13 December as she was walking along Bellrock Street in the direction of Cranhill Park with her German shepherd Kai. Mrs Campbell was wearing pyjama bottoms and a black, three-quarter-length jacket with a hood. Crimestoppers offered a reward of up to £5,000. During an appeal last month Detective Chief Inspector Colin Carey, the officer in charge of the investigation for Police Scotland, said: 'Jean's family are devastated by the loss of their wife, mother and grandmother and they deserve answers.'

"By . David Mccormack . and Associated  Press Reporter . An Army National Guardsman was in a jealous rage when killed his former girlfriend and another man before fatally shooting himself in northern Utah early on Monday, according to police. Before embarking on his killing spree, Jared Tolman, 23, left a suicide note at his home in Logan in which he admitted that what he was about to do was selfish. Tolman is reported to have sent a series of unanswered text messages to Mackenzie Madden before he kicked down the door of her apartment two blocks from Utah State University shortly after midnight on Monday. Scroll down for video . Before embarking on his killing spree, Jared Tolman, 23, left a suicide note at his home in Logan in which he admitted that what he was about to do was selfish . He then fired an assault rifle multiple times at Madden, 19, and her friend Johnathon Sadler, 25, both people he knew, police said. ‘Basically there were three boys all interested in the same girl,’ Logan Police Lt. Rod Peterson told KSL.com. ‘Mr. Tolman is one of the three men that is interested in MacKenzie, and I’m not sure he was particularly fond of whatever relationship Johnathon had with MacKenzie.’ It's unclear if Tolman knew beforehand that Sadler was in Madden's home, although that might have triggered his actions, said Peterson. Tolman broke into his ex-girlfriend Mackenzie Madden's (left) apartment and shot her dead along with her 25-year-old friend Johnathan Sadler (right) Stephanie .

Officers responding to . 911 calls found her and Sadler dead inside the unit. The . gunman then went to another apartment a few miles away, authorities . said, to look for a man he believed was involved with Madden. But the . man was not home because he was staying with family. ‘When . he did not find him at home, as I suspect he thought he would, he . turned the gun on himself and shot himself,’ Peterson said.

"By . Stephen Johns . If you found yourself overindulging to the point of tipsiness during the hot spell, you’re in good company… with seagulls. Experts say the birds are becoming ‘drunk’ by gorging on flying ants, which have been leaving their nests early due to the heat. Councils around the country have started to take action to control the birds, which have been dive-bombing at people on the street and creating a mess by rummaging through bin bags to find food. How did I get up here? Britain's seagulls have been getting 'drunk' by eating flying ants . It is believed that the gulls have been acting strangely because the formic acid in the ants’ bodies has been reacting with their stomachs. Dr Rebecca Nesbit from the Society of Biology, told the Daily Telegraph: ‘Some of the slightly odd behaviour we are seeing could be as a result of these ants – it could leave the gulls slightly drunk. ‘It’s possible because we know that some ants produce formic acid, and it could be having an effect. There have certainly been many, many more of them this summer. ‘The gulls can also get very excited and loud when they eat the ants, so that could be a contributing factor.’ Last week in Plymouth, Devon the city council launched a campaign against the seagull attacks by targeting ‘known feeders’ of the birds. Councillor Brian Vincent said: ‘We’ve seen a steady rise in the number of gulls and people complaining about their behaviour.’ While residents in Islington, London complained after dive-bombing seagulls turned their street into ‘something out of Alfred Hitchcock’s The Birds’. Gull expert Peter Rock said seagulls have been moving into urbanised areas for years, so complaints about their bad behaviour came as ‘no surprise’. He said: ‘It’s the sheer number of gulls in built up areas now. They are right in our faces, and they are not scared. ‘The pest control industry has been trying their best, but they can’t outsmart seagulls. ‘People are trying anything - spikes, tension wires – I even saw a plastic eagle owl once. ‘But they are wasting money on this stuff because seagulls are just too clever.’ The seaside town, Tenby in Pembrokeshire, Wales, introduced a range of ‘bird-proof’ bags this summer to combat the problem of the seagulls eating waste food. The town clerk Andrew Davies, said Tenby had become ‘an all-you-can-eat buffet for the birds’. He continued: ‘We get so many complaints about them. They have just become a general nuisance.’","Britain's seagulls are getting drunk by eating flying ants .

"By . Stephen Johns . They have been a godsend for passengers who crave a peaceful journey – as well as commuters who need to work on the go. But train operators are axing ‘quiet carriages’ – because they are apparently causing rows among passengers. Staff are said to be finding it difficult to mediate between customers when the tranquil haven is spoiled by those who insist on using noisy gadgets, talking loudly, singing or drinking alcohol. Despite some train operators axing quiet carriages, South West Trains are unaffected by the move . Bosses will now just ask fellow travellers to be nicer to each other – a move that has been described as a victory for yobs. Train operator CrossCountry is scrapping quiet carriages on long distance routes, while First Great Western is converting first class quiet carriages to standard class on its high-speed lines. CrossCountry customer Brian McGlone, from Edinburgh, claims he was told that quiet coaches were creating ‘confrontational situations’. Mr McGlone, who was travelling on the Glasgow to Penzance route on Thursday, added: ‘I asked the ticket collector, who told me that they had scrapped the quiet coach because staff were finding it difficult to mediate between the drunken yobs and the passengers. It’s a defeat for civilised passengers. ‘I’ve seen potential for conflict before. Very often you get people coming into the quiet carriage and making noise, playing music and drinking beer. ‘I feel it’s a victory for the train yobs. There are other carriages they could go to. They should respect that people have booked the quiet coach.’ Bosses will now just ask fellow passengers to be nicer to each other - a move described as a victory for yobs . The train operator will now use a mixture of announcements and signs to foster consideration. Richard Gibson, from CrossCountry, said quiet carriages weren’t an ‘antidote’ to antisocial behaviour, but added: ‘Modern technology has improved to the point that you don’t have to shout any more to be heard and people are communicating in different ways. ‘Headphones for games and phones are much better, they don’t emit the noise they used to. ‘Designating an entire carriage as a quiet coach doesn’t seem to be as relevant any more. We’re not saying you can’t use a phone or listen to music but to think of other people there and act responsibly.’ First Great Western said it is removing quiet carriage status on one coach to increase capacity on its high-speed routes and denied that passenger conflict was behind the decision. However, first class carriages are to get a revamp, including glass screens to create a quieter and ‘more ambient’ environment. East Coast trains and Virgin said there were no plans to alter quiet coaches on their services.","Cross Country is scrapping quiet carriages on long distance routes .

"By . Stephen Johns . Britain's biggest insurer has called for a ban on whiplash payouts to save motorists £32 a year on their premiums. Aviva, which insures 2.5million drivers, blamed a ‘compensation culture’ and ‘ambulance-chasing lawyers’ for a flood of bogus insurance claims. The firm has suggested ending virtually all payments for minor neck injuries – which average around £2,500 each – in a move that has been dismissed as ‘diabolically ludicrous’ by lawyers. Whiplash insurance claims, which account for 94 per cent of car crash claims, should be banned, say Aviva . Insurers should only cover the cost of ‘rehabilitating’ those who say they were hurt, it says. This would involve firms assessing injuries then paying for any treatment needed. Those who cannot work would still get compensation but it would root out others who may be trying to make a bogus claim. Aviva says the move could save £900million and knock £32 off the average annual motor insurance premium of £358. Whiplash claims accounted for 94 per cent of all its personal injury claims from motor accidents last year. Maurice Tulloch, from Aviva, said: ‘If the UK is serious about reducing the cost of motor insurance we have to address the way we compensate minor whiplash, using rehabilitation only to treat genuine, minor injuries.’ The firm also suggested raising the claim threshold at which personal injury lawyers can get involved from £1,000 to £5,000. Craig Budsworth, of the Motor Accident Solicitors Society, told the Financial Times: ‘This can’t happen. It’s diabolically ludicrous. You’re being compensated for the fact you’ve suffered a traumatic event.’ Aviva, which insures 2.5million drivers, say the plans would dramatically reduce the price of insuring a car .","Aviva says 'compensation culture' causing flood of bogus neck injury claims .

"By . Stephen Johns . and Steph Cockroft . Andrew Lloyd-Webber said he requested the forms to join assisted suicide . clinic Dignitas after 14 painful back and leg . operations . Lord Lloyd-Webber took steps to join assisted suicide clinic Dignitas, he revealed last night. The West End composer was so convinced he wanted to die last summer that he requested forms for the the Swiss clinic. He said a bout of deep depression, triggered by the pain from a series of operations, caused him to consider suicide. But the 66-year-old, who previously suffered with prostate cancer, said he now felt it would have been a ‘stupid and ridiculous’ thing to do. The peer is likely to oppose the bill to legalise ‘assisted dying’ tabled by Lord Falconer, the former Lord Chancellor, which will be debated today. Lord Lloyd-Webber, who said he struggled with the pain after 14 back and leg operations, told the Daily Telegraph: ‘I went through a moment of deep depression – that awful moment when you think that you must find a way out. ‘I actually got the forms for Dignitas. With hindsight, it was stupid and ridiculous, but I couldn’t think what to do.’ He said as his symptoms alleviated he decided to throw the forms away and expects to oppose the bill but remains torn on the issue. He continued: ‘What concerns me, and I suspect many others, is what floodgates would [this measure] open? Scroll down for video . The 66-year-old said his mother had expressed a wish to end her life five years before she died, aged 72, but was not ready to die - something he fears would become common if the law is approved . ‘Does it create a culture where older people are a burden ... I am totally unsure.’ Nearly 130 peers have signed up to speak in a 10-hour debate, which will begin the biggest ever challenge to Britain’s euthanasia laws. Under the bill, doctors would be able to prescribe a lethal dose of drugs to patients in England and Wales with less than six moths to live. Two doctors would have to confirm that the patient had the capacity to make an informed decision to die. One of the two doctors would then provide the drugs with which the patient would end their life. Lord Lloyd-Webber also told the paper that he believed his mother Jean Lloyd Webber, a distinguished piano teacher, would have chosen to end her life had the law been in place while she was alive. He said that she expressed a wish to end her life, five years before she died peacefully in December 1993, aged 72. But Lord Lloyd-Webber believes his mother - who cycled and walked until her death - was not ready to die. He said he fears that 'in the future, someone like her could be assisted to die', before they are ready. Dominic Grieve, former Attorney General, said the assisted dying bill is flawed and said it could lead to 'a form of legalised execution' He told the paper: 'She kept saying she couldn't continue any more because she was a burden on us. 'We . told her she was anything but... In the state she was in, I fear that a . couple of doctors would have concluded that, if she wished to kill . herself, they would agree.' The composer's brief consideration to join Dignitas came after he underwent a procedure to ease a pain he developed in his leg, around two years ago. That, and a back operation, led to the composer having 14 operations, which propelled him into a state of depression. He said he would approach the debate . with an open mind and listen to the arguments, but would also think . about his mother and 'reflect on personal experience'. 'With hindsight, it was stupid and ridiculous, but I couldn’t think what to do' Lord Lloyd-Webber . Dominic Grieve, who was the Government’s chief law officer until the cabinet reshuffle this week, said the proposals could open the door to a form of ‘legalised execution’. The former Attorney General, said: ‘I think that the assisted dying bill is flawed and seeking to do something that could lead to a form of legalised execution, however well intended. ‘It is not something that a civilised society should do.’ Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, also said he believed the proposals would 'devalue' the lives of people living with disabilities. This week, a group of 27 leading doctors urged the House of Lords to support the bill, saying terminally ill people suffering ‘unendurably’ should be allowed to end their lives. It came as leaders from Britain's major faiths - the Church of England, the Catholic Church and the Jewish faith - put their names to a joint letter which pleaded with Parliament not to legalise assisted dying. The letter, signed by 23 leaders, including Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, said it would be a 'grave error' which could change society forever.","He requested forms for the Swiss clinic after 14 back and leg operations .

"By . Stephen Johns . English athletes have been briefed on how to react if they are booed at the Commonwealth Games by Scottish fans next week. Several athletes have approached Team England for guidance amid fears that Scottish nationalists could heckle them when they compete. The Games, which start on Wednesday, take place less than two months before the referendum on Scottish independence. Auld Enemy: English athletes fear that Scottish fans may heckle them during the Commonwealth Games which begin on Wednesday (file picture) There are concerns that anti-English sentiment may be running high among some Scottish sports fans and athletes are aware that some may direct abuse towards the Auld Enemy. Organisers have insisted that English athletes have nothing to worry about and will be given a warm reception, second only to members of Team Scotland. But a Games insider said that a ‘small number’ of English athletes had already raised the subject of booing and had been told not to react to it. Other athletes will be given the same advice if they ask Team England about it, and general guidance may be issued as part of a team briefing before the Games. A spokesman for Team England said: ‘If it happens I’m sure the athletes will all just carry on. Some sports are more adversarial than others. ‘We were all at Hampden Park for the Glasgow Grand Prix athletics meeting at the weekend and the welcome could not have been better. ‘Going on the evidence of the Hampden Park meeting, the Scottish athletes will get the biggest cheer, followed by the other home nations athletes and then the athletes from other countries.’ Reaction: Team England said those who competed at Hampden Park during the Glasgow Grand Prix on Saturday (pictured) were given a warm welcome and have advised English competitors not to ignore the boos . Members of Team England will take part in the athletes’ parade at the opening ceremony in Celtic Park next Wednesday. Those from the delegation who have been in Glasgow this week in preparation have been given a warm welcome by their Scottish hosts and are not expecting any problems. Activists protested outside 10 Downing Street last night calling for David Cameron to speak out against homophobia ahead of the Games. Of the 53 countries in the Commonwealth, 42 criminalise homosexuality and campaigners are demanding that the Government uses the Games to tackle the issue.","Athletes have approached Team England managers to ask how to react .

"By . Stephen Johns . The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby was forced to admit last year that the Church had invested in one of Wonga's main financial backers . The Church of England has severed its ties with controversial payday lender Wonga. Last night, The Church Commissioners for England, which produces money to support the Church of England, said it was ‘pleased to announce’ the indirect investment exposure to Wonga in its venture capital portfolio has been removed. A commissioners spokesman said: ‘[We] no longer have any financial or any other interest in Wonga.’ Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby was forced to admit last year that the Church of England had invested in one of Wonga’s main financial backers. This came after he had promised to compete the payday lender ‘out of business’ with Church of England-backed credit unions. Although the amount of Church money indirectly invested in Wonga was less than £100,000 out of investments totalling more than £5bn, it proved embarrassing for the Archbishop. In a statement last night, the Church Commissioners for England said it had not made any profit from their connections to Wonga. It said: ‘The Church Commissioners for England are pleased to announce that their indirect investment exposure to Wonga in their venture capital portfolio has been removed. ‘The Church Commissioners no longer have any financial or any other interest in Wonga. ‘The terms ensure that the Church Commissioners have not made any profit from their investment exposure to Wonga. ‘At no time have the Commissioners invested directly in Wonga or in other pay day lenders. ‘The indirect exposure of the Commissioners through pooled funds represented considerably less than 0.01% of the value of Wonga.’ The Church Commissioners had struggled to sell off the stake because it was tied up in other investments. Last week City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority revealed Wonga would have to pay £2.6million compensation to 45,000 people sent letters from two invented debt recovery firms . The Most Rev Justin Welby recently warned that forcing payday loan companies out of business too quickly could leave poor people at the mercy of criminal loan sharks. Last year it was discovered the Church of England’s £5bn pension fund, which had a policy banning it from investing in payday lenders, had invested in Accel Partners, a US venture capital firm and a major Wonga investor. Wonga has been criticised for its interest rates on loans, and the quoted APR on Wonga’s website is 5853 per cent. And just weeks ago Wonga was ordered to pay £2.6 million to around 45,000 customers after an investigation started by the Office of Fair Trading, and the Financial Conduct Authority, found that Wonga had sent letters to customers in arrears from law firms that did not exist. Wonga was founded by Errol Damelin and Jonty Hurwitz – both now aged 44 and originally from South Africa - in 2007. Within two years of setting the loans company up, they had raised £14million from City investors – and now the multi-millionaires enjoy luxury homes and lifestyles. Mr Damelin’s personal fortune is estimated at more than £34million, while Mr Hurwitz’s is said to be over £25million. Mr Damelin, who reportedly paid himself £1million a year, has previously claimed the loans Wonga provides are a force for good. In 2012, he said: ‘Credit in consumer society is absolutely critical. Without it, you have no social mobility...wealthy people will stay wealthy.’","The Church Commissioners for England confirmed it had severed ties .

"By . Farrukh Dhondy . and Stephen Johns . Zafar Iqbal (far left), pictured with Harriet Harman (right), has been found guilty of 25 counts of historic sex abuse against three women in the 1970s and 1980s . A high-profile Muslim charity leader has been convicted of sexually abusing three young girls in the  1970s and 1980s. Zafar Iqbal, chief executive of Southwark Muslim Women’s Association (SMWA) in South London, was found guilty of 25 counts of historic sex abuse against three women at Woolwich Crown Court last month. All of his victims were under the age of 14 when the historic offences were committed. Documents seen by The Mail on Sunday detail 67-year-old Iqbal’s sickening abuse of his young victims. They describe how he forced his tongue into their mouths as he molested and groped them.Iqbal founded the SMWA, which is part-funded by Southwark Council,  in 1979. His work there included running a creche and educational and recreational programmes. It is believed that his wife, Abida, also worked for the SMWA. Just five years ago, Iqbal was feted for his ‘excellence in education’ at The Muslim News Awards  for Excellence. In the course of his work he rubbed shoulders with politicians such as Labour Deputy Leader Harriet Harman and was introduced to the Queen in 2010 as part of The City Bridge Trust’s 800th anniversary celebration. In 2009, Ms Harman, then Deputy Prime Minister, invited Iqbal and other members of the Association to the House of Commons where they were photographed together. Earlier this year Ms Harman was forced to express ‘regret’ over links between a paedophile group and the National Council of Civil Liberties when she was its legal officer in the 1970s and 1980s. The Paedophile Information Exchange was an affiliate of the NCCL while she, her husband, trade unionist Jack Dromey, and fellow Labour politician Patricia Hewitt held office there. A Southwark Council spokesman said they had informed police after allegations of Iqbal’s abuse surfaced in 2010. Zafar Iqbal, chief executive of Southwark Muslim Women's Association (SMWA) in South London, was found guilty of 25 counts of historic sex abuse against three women at Woolwich Crown Court (pictured) last month . He said: ‘Southwark Muslim Women’s Association is an independent organisation funded from many sources, including the council. ‘The convictions are not related  to activities on the premises of  the organisation. ‘We are appalled by this man’s actions and are undertaking an urgent review of SMWA and its association with the council. A spokesman for the Metropolitan police said it began investigations in late 2012 after one of Iqbal’s victims came forward. Previous allegations made in 2010 were anonymous and so the force was unable to pursue them. The SMWA was unavailable for comment. Iqbal has been bailed until sentencing on June 9.","Zafar Iqbal, 67, guilty of 25 counts of historic sex abuse against three girls .

"By . Stephen Johns . Tesco is planning to build thousands of homes on land previously earmarked for supermarkets. The chain owns vast areas of undeveloped land across the UK and will now use it to build 4,000 properties. The decision comes as Tesco shifts its focus from large out-of-town supermarkets to smaller convenience stores and online retail. Tesco reportedly owns 310 out-of-town sites which it has not built on, making up a total area of 1,100 acres . Last month it was revealed that . Britain’s biggest retailer was hoarding more than 1,000 acres of . undeveloped land, after buying hundreds of out-of-town sites during the . 1990s and 2000s, most of which were earmarked for Tesco Extra . hypermarkets. But last year . the company wrote down the value of its land by £800million after . admitting that much of it would never be built on. It is estimated that Tesco owns 310 undeveloped sites across Britain, which could be used to build 15,000 homes. Now, the retailer has scheduled that 4,000 homes will be built on its land by 2017, according to Property Week magazine. The extent of Tesco's combined undeveloped land is the equivalent of three Hyde Parks, pictured, and would be enough to build the entire expanse of the Government's planned new garden city at Ebbsfleet, Kent . Tesco, . which has a £20billion property portfolio, has yet to decide whether to . sell the land to developers or build the homes itself, using developer . Spenhill, which it owns. Philip Clarke, Tesco chief executive, says he is facing the worst trading environment in his 40-year history . A Tesco spokeman said: ‘We are currently . working on plans for over 4,000 homes across the UK, either by building . them ourselves or selling our sites to housing developers. ‘In . places where we have already delivered housing schemes, for example in . Faversham or Highams Park, the feedback from local communities and . councils has been very positive. We are pleased to be bringing new . investment to communities up and down the country and playing our part . in meeting local housing needs over the coming years.’ Last month Tesco announced its worst results for 20 years, with sales falling by 3.8 per cent over the past three months. Out-of-town . supermarkets have seen sales decline as British shoppers give up their . big weekly visits and turn to smaller convenience stores and online . retailers. German discounters Aldi and Lidl have also provided competition to the supermarkets. As . a result, Tesco is slowing down its stores opening programme and . revamping its existing hypermarkets by installing restaurants, coffee . shops and bakeries. The company said: ‘As we have previously announced, . in response to changing customer shopping habits we have decided to . reduce the amount of new store space we build each year, building fewer . large stores. ‘Where we no longer intend  to develop sites, we sell them,  lease them or develop them  for housing.’","Tesco will build homes on 1,100 acres of land which it has not yet built on .

"By . Stephen Johns . Fans will be able to sip tea Laura Carmichael or even eat with her at London's Criterion restaurant . Taking tea with a member of the Crawley family would be a thrill for any true fan of Downton Abbey. And now devotees of the hit ITV drama can do just that – for the princely sum of £4,500. Laura Carmichael, who plays Lady Edith in the series, is offering the public the chance to win a string of Downton-related prizes in a new charity campaign. In addition to joining Laura for cucumber sandwiches and a cup of Earl Grey or Darjeeling, other prizes include a personal etiquette session with Lady Edith via Skype for £1,500, and a period silver tea set signed by the cast for £900. And for a £6 donation, fans can enter a draw to visit the Downton set and win dinner with Laura at the Criterion Restaurant in London. Money raised will go to support the umbrella organisation Haiti: Make Births Safe. It was set up recently to ensure the health of mothers and children on the Caribbean island, which was hit by a devastating earthquake in 2010. An estimated 200,000 people died in the tremor, thousands of homes were damaged or destroyed, and hospitals and schools were also reduced to rubble. Laura visited the island last year with members of the Kent-based charity The Haiti Hospital Appeal, which forms part of Haiti: Make Births Safe. She said: ‘It was one of the most memorable and amazing experiences of my life. Laura Carmichael as Lady Edith, right, with Lady Painswick, played by Samantha Bond, on the hit ITV show . ‘Having the opportunity to meet some of the amazing Haitian doctors who are doing so much, under such difficult circumstances, was incredibly moving and inspiring. ‘Many people associate my connection with Haiti and the maternity care situation around the story in Downton Abbey where my on-screen sister, Lady Sybil, died in childbirth from eclampsia. In Haiti, eclampsia is still a major risk, and still tragically takes many lives.’ She added: ‘The few doctors there are doing all they can to ease the situation. Seeing their passion was the real inspiration.’ So far more than £15,000 has been raised through the competition, and the campaign is hoping to  reach its £60,000 target by the time entries close next month. Laura said: ‘We would love people to get behind this. For one of the prizes, I’ll be showing people around the set at Highclere Castle, introducing them to the cast, and taking them out for dinner at the Criterion Restaurant, where we filmed some of last series.’ The money raised by the sale will go to aid work in Haiti, which is still suffering nearly four years after a massive earthquake rocked the country, claiming 200,000 lives and destroying infrastructre . Laura is not the first Downton star to use her profile to raise money from devotees. Elizabeth McGovern, who plays her mother, the Countess of Grantham, also offered various incentives for fans to support her band, Sadie & the Hotheads, including a 15-minute video conversation on Skype for £50. The fifth series of Downton Abbey is being filmed and is due to be broadcast in the autumn.","Fans will be able to buy the experiences as part of a charity campaign .

"By . Stephen Johns . The tradition of the long soak is dwindling as people prefer speedy cleaning to relaxation . It used to be one of the most popular ways to unwind after a busy day. But for millions the idea of slipping into a warm soothing bath is a thing of the past. Now a quarter of Britons admit they have never had a bath, according to a survey. Instead they are opting for a quick shower, often lasting just 30 seconds rather than a long soak in the tub, because of time constraints. A survey of 1,000 people across Britain found on average 26 per cent of the population never run a bath. In London and the south east, almost a third of people said that they do not splash around in a hot bath. People in the west Midlands are more likely to spend time in the bath, with 80 per cent taking regular baths. The figures appear to show that time for personal hygiene is at a premium, due to the modern pace of life. Seventeen per cent of the population spend less than 30 seconds in the shower every morning. Sharon Barclay from Homebase said: ‘An entire generation is missing out on a spectacular sensation which our grandparents took for granted. ‘Even the Romans refused to forego the extraordinary pleasure of having a bath when they came to Britain in 55 BC. ‘However, such is the pace of modern life, that a ritual which has lasted for centuries is in risk of falling out of favour in just two decades. ‘Being able to have a shower when you’re in a rush each morning is a tremendous advantage. ‘However, nothing beats being able to relax in a hot, foaming bath at the end of a long hard day.’ Young people aged between 18 and 24, were the generation most reluctant to have a bath. The trend away from having a bath was spread evenly between men and women. An average bath uses 80 litres of water but some power showers can use up to 136 litres in an eight-minute wash. In sixteenth century Britain, many towns had public baths connected to the local bakery, using the heat from ovens to warm the water. The shower is many Briton's preferred way to clean, with more than 70 per cent of people in the south east choosing it over the bath . East Anglia: 25.84 per cent . East Midlands: 28.57 per cent . London: 30.16 per cent . North East: 21.05 per cent . North West: 23.62 per cent . Northern Ireland : 34.48 per cent . Scotland: 24.72 per cent . South East : 33.56 per cent . South West: 25.56 per cent . Wales: 20 per cent . West Midlands: 19.98 per cent . Yorkshire and Humber: 24.69 per cent .","Quarter of Britons are more likely to have a quick shower .

"By . Stephen Johns . A jealous husband who thought his wife had cheated on him littered the neighbourhood with racy pictures of her in an act of revenge. Ian Cuthbert stuck the saucy posters on cars and trees and even pinned one on the noticeboard at a local primary school. They showed a photo of Alison Kidd in a provocative pose wearing black lingerie alongside the wording ‘Lock up your husbands’ and ‘Married 16/03/2013 and committing adultery within days’. Couple: Alison Kidd and Ian Cuthbert wed last year but fell out several months later and are now divorcing . Cuthbert, who thought the 34-year-old nursery assistant had cheated on . him with another  man, began his campaign when their marriage faltered . just six months after they became man  and wife. The IT manager had a . number of the leaflets printed, which he nailed to trees and put on car . windshields and through letterboxes. Raunchy: Cuthbert distributed this poster of his estranged wife around their neighbourhood . Mother-of-two Miss Kidd, who is now seeking a divorce, said he was very bitter after she announced she was leaving him. She said: ‘It was an extremely abusive relationship. ‘I’m happy to put it behind  me and try to move on with my  life. It was mental abuse and a  very bad time in my life. I was shocked and embarrassed by what happened, but to be honest I wasn’t surprised he did something like that.’ The couple were married on March 16 last year at the Houston House Hotel in Uphall, West Lothian, but the marriage soon fell into difficulty and Miss Kidd moved out of their home in July last year. In September Cuthbert began distributing the posters of his wife around the East Craigs area of Edinburgh. Miss Kidd added: ‘It was the sort of thing he would do. He’s a nasty piece of work. He was very bitter that I wanted to leave and he was paranoid. I previously received a string of abusive texts and emails from him.’ Cuthbert, 46, pleaded guilty at Edinburgh Sheriff Court to behaving in a threatening or abusive manner by putting flyers up near to East Craigs Primary School. Fiscal depute Bruce Macrosson told the court earlier this week that Miss Kidd had been informed about the flyers by friends and contacted police. Defence solicitor, James Kelly, representing Cuthbert, said:  ‘He accepts his responsibility for the offence.’ Guilty: Cuthbert has admitting behaving in a threatening or abusive manner towards Ms Kidd . Sheriff Isabella McColl told Cuthbert that his actions were ‘a form of assault’ and called for background reports. Sentencing was deferred. Miss Kidd said her husband’s bail conditions meant he was prevented from approaching her or coming near to where she lives. ‘The police told me they expect he’ll get away with community sentence. I just want to make sure I never see him again.’","Ian Cuthbert and Alison Kidd married in March last year but soon fell out .

A British mother had taken domestic violence warrants out on her deranged ex-partner who could have been detained in police custody, preventing him from murdering their 11-year-old son at sports practice in Australia. Rosemary Batty watched in horror as Greg Anderson stabbed and beat their son, Luke Batty, to death with a cricket bat on Wednesday after an evening training session in a Melbourne suburb.

'It was just a little cricket practice, there were people there, I believed he was safe,' said Mrs Batty, 52. 'I looked for help, and I ran towards help and screaming, 'Get an ambulance, get an ambulance, this is bad, this is really, really bad,' she said. 'From what I could see, Luke had been injured. I thought it was an accident, I had no reason to think otherwise.' Police arrived on the scene and attempted to subdue the man with capsicum spray.

"By . Stephen Johns . Ministers have been warned to stop wasting money on projects such as climate-change schemes in wealthy countries. Development Secretary Justine Greening fears British taxpayers are funding poorly run projects in middle-income countries that do not need support. Miss Greening warns ministers in a letter that they risk breaching international protocols and face investigation by Britain’s aid watchdog if they continue to spend money on anything other than countries in extreme poverty. Scroll down for video . Wasteful? Projects funded with Britain's generous aid budget include the 'Ethiopian Spice Girls' Yegna, who received £3.8million . Hot air: British aid to China is being used to upgrade business parks, promote trade union rights and fund training for gay rights activists. £15million has also been used to curb the flatulence of Colombian cows (above) Recent projects to draw criticism include £3.8million spent on an Ethiopian girl band, and a £15million fund to curb the flatulence of Colombian cows. Although she did not single out any departments in the letter, seen by the Daily Telegraph, Mrs Greening fears that spending by the Department for Energy and Climate Change (Decc), in particular, on wasteful projects could undermine public support for overseas aid. The department, run by Liberal Democrat Ed Davey, recently gave £15million to cattle ranchers in Colombia, the world’s 30th richest country, to help cut flatulence in cows. It also funded projects in Turkey and Chile, which have also enjoyed rapid economic growth. Relief: Ministers have been warned to focus efforts on genuine hardship, such as that caused by Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, where Britain was active in rescue efforts . Miss Greening’s department, which . accounts for a large share of aid spending, has cut back funds from 43 . countries to 28, including ending support to Russia and China. 'We send money all over the world. Now we need to give people down here the hope that they will get what they need' Ian Liddell-Grainger, Bridgwater MP . In . 2012, the UK spent £8.62 billion in overseas development assistance, . with 87 per cent, or £7.53billion, spent by Mrs Greening’s department.

Warning: The letter was sent by Development Secretary Justine Greening . The five-strong group launched a radio show and released a string of videos that aim to empower women in the African country. Miss Greening’s letter, which was sent on December 23, was copied to the Prime Minister and Nick Clegg.

Departments . that fund wasteful projects may face investigation by the Independent . Commission on Aid Impact, Britain’s aid watchdog. She . wrote: ‘We are making sure spending is targeted to where it is needed . the most. Taxpayers rightly expect all overseas development aid, . irrespective of the spending department, to be high quality and well . targeted. ‘All departments need to make sure they are delivering this and show they are meeting the OECD eligibility criteria.’ Mrs .

"By . Stephen Johns . A pedigree puppy bought as a present was crushed to death in a reclining chair in a tragic accident. Devastated owners Lynsey Smith and Paul Gardner were heartbroken when they found the dog. Mr Gardner spent £1,000 on the Chihuahua, called Tillie, as a present for his girlfriend Miss Smith, 21, who was getting over the loss of her grandad. Shocking: Lynsey Smith, 21 (right), and boyfriend Paul Gardner, 20 (left), were devastated when their pet Chihuahua Tillie was crushed to death in this reclining chair . Anguish: The tiny dog had crawled inside the back of the reclining chair and became caught in the reclining mechanism . But the puppy was killed aged just 14 weeks after it crawled into the back of an electrical reclining chair, used by her mother Charlotte Smith as an aide for standing up. Mr Gardner, 20, an upholsterer, said the gap at the back of the chair was large enough for a child to crawl under and was unsafe. The chair was supplied by Medequip, who provide community equipment services, in October as part of a contract with Barnet Council. Tragedy: The puppy was killed after it crawled into the back of an electrical reclining chair, used by Miss Smith's mother Charlotte as an aide for standing up . Shock: Mr Gardner believes that Tillie was only underneath the chair for a few moments before she got crushed in the hydraulics . The couple say they were 'devastated' by their loss, and want to warn other dog owners about the chair's dangers. Mr Gardner, from Barnet, North London, said: ‘On Wednesday night we couldn’t find Tillie, and were looking everywhere for her. Then we looked under the reclining chair and saw that she had been crushed. ‘We’re both shocked and devastated. Tillie could have only been underneath it for a few moments. Someone must have moved the chair and she got crushed in the hydraulics. I just can’t believe that this has happened. ‘I’m an upholsterer and I’ve never seen a chair designed as badly. There’s a Velcro flap about ten inches up and 15 inches wide. A small child could easily crawl inside it. Upset: The chair was supplied by Medequip, who provide community equipment services, in October as part of a contract with Barnet Council . ‘Behind the flap there’s a hydraulic pump and bars which move up and down. Tillie was a lovely dog, she’s irreplaceable. If we spent £1 million, we would never find another dog like her again. ‘Lynsey was really close to Tillie.' Miss Smith said that the dog had been well looked after, and that the chair should be made safer with proper warnings given to prevent a similar tragedy happening again. 'We are all devastated that our puppy has passed, she was a member of our family,' she said. A Barnet Council spokesman said: ‘We are very sorry to hear about this sad case. Medequip supply recliner chairs such as these on behalf of the council, and as part of the service demonstrate how to use each piece of equipment. ‘They also leave information and guidance notes with the customer, which includes a warning to be careful of small pets.’ A spokesman for Medequip said that they were investigating the issue.","Paul Gardner spent £1,000 on the puppy for girlfriend Lynsey Smith .

"By . Michael Blackley . and Stephen Johns . Scotland is to join the rest of the UK by agreeing to legalise gay marriage later this week. The Scottish Parliament’s 128 MSPs will disregard massive opposition to the radical plan by voting on Wednesday to allow same-sex couples to marry. The issue has already humiliated David Cameron, with 133 of his Tory MPs trying voting against the proposals in the House of Commons earlier this year. Controversial: Politicians in Scotland are disregarding public opposition by backing same-sex marriage . Now Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond – a passionate champion of same-sex marriage - will also face a rebellion on the issue, with one of his Ministers revealing he will vote against the plans, as well as a clutch of SNP backbenchers. But a survey of all MSPs by the Mail on Sunday has revealed that an overwhelming majority of MSPs will back the proposals when they vote on the issue for the first time on Wednesday evening. Although the Bill will then be subject to additional revision by a parliamentary committee before a final vote at some point next year, securing approval ‘in principle’ is likely to end any doubts about the legislation being passed. Opponents of the legislation will then start to focus on campaigning for appropriate safeguards to be put in place to protect the rights of people who refuse to promote same-sex marriage and ensure that no individual celebrant is forced to hold gay ceremonies against their will. Our survey reveals that 86 MSPs have confirmed they will vote for same-sex marriage, while 11 plan to vote against. However, the rebellion against the move could grow in the coming days, as ten MSPs say they remain undecided and a further 20 have refused to reveal how they will vote on the issue. Leader: First Minister Alex Salmond is one of the MSPs said to be voting in favour of gay marriage . The decision to press ahead with the move comes despite the Scottish Government’s biggest ever public consultation revealing that more than two-thirds of respondents opposed the plan. The issue has led to considerable tension within the SNP. Four Nationalist MSPs say they will definitely vote against the move – including Alasdair Allan, the Minister for Learning, Sciences and Scotland’s Languages, as well as backbenchers Richard Lyle, John Mason and Dave Thompson. Mr Allan, who represents the Western Isles and is a former senior media relations officer at the Church of Scotland, said hundreds of his constituents have been in touch to urge him to back the ‘traditional definition of marriage’. He said: ‘In responding to people, I have pointed out that I am supportive of the existing rights of same-sex couples to civil partnerships, and that I welcome the belated respect which society rightly gives gay people, but that I believe difficult issues are raised around the specific question of marriage. This view has also been informed by the strength of feeling which exists among many people in the islands. ‘Among all these different views, the view which so many of my constituents have expressed to me has a right to be recorded, and for that reason it is my intention to vote against the Bill.’ The Scottish Mail on Sunday survey is the most detailed research ever carried out into the views of Scotland’s MSPs on same-sex marriage. As all MSPs will be allowed to vote on the issue as a ‘matter of conscience’ – without being told how to vote by party whips – the result is less predictable than on most issues in the Scottish parliament, where the SNP has a majority and is normally able to confidently press through its opposition. Split: The Scottish Conservatives were the only party to have more MSPs opposed to the legislation, which is embarrassing to Ruth Davidson, the party's openly gay leader who has been a prominent supporter . The Scottish Conservatives were the only party to have more MSPs opposed to the legislation than supportive of it – with six saying they will vote against the Bill and just four saying they will vote for it. That is embarrassing for Ruth Davidson, the party’s leader, who has been one of the most prominent supporters of the legislation at Holyrood. The Scottish Government is committed to a . Scotland that is fair and equal and that is why we believe that same . sex couples who wish should be allowed to marry as soon as possible . Scottish Government Spokesman . But Miss Davidson said: ‘I believe the forthcoming bill on same sex marriage is an issue of conscience, which is why I have given Conservative MSPs a free vote on the issue. ‘I support same sex marriage and will be voting to pass this bill.’ The four SNP members who have said they will vote against the plans are expected to be joined by more rebels on Wednesday, with four nationalist MSPs saying they remain undecided and a further ten saying they won’t reveal their view before voting later this week. Former SNP leader Gordon Wilson believes that pressing ahead with the legislation will cost the party votes in future elections – and urged MSPs to ensure they get proper protection for religious groups who don’t want to hold same-sex marriages. He said: ‘Bland assurances will not necessarily deal with the realities of supervision of the legislation by the courts. ‘There’s a majority for it but once you get the principle what then happens is it’s about “on what terms”? Like any insurance policy, it’s about the small print – look at what the small print says. That’s my advice to MSPs – even if you’re in favour, look at the small print and what might happen because the courts are outwith your control.’ Following Wednesday’s vote, the Bill . will then return to Holyrood’s equal opportunities committee, which will . consider any amendments which need to be made. It remains on track to be passed in time to allow the first gay weddings to take place in 2015. Opponents . of same-sex marriage want more to be done to ensure that those who . continue to believe in traditional marriage do not suffer discrimination . in their career or have freedom of speech restricted. They fear that some professionals, such as teachers, could be sacked if they fail to promote gay marriage. Freedom: MSPs will be allowed to vote as a 'matter of conscience' when they cast their ballots at Holyrood . A spokesman for the Scotland For Marriage pressure group, which includes representatives of the Catholic Church in Scotland and The Christian Institute, said: ‘The Scottish Government’s promise of sufficient safeguards have been shown to be hollow. Real safeguards set out in amendments to the legislation are required to protect the rights and civil liberties of the majority of Scots who don’t support this law.’ Among those set to vote against the Bill is Tory MSP Alex Johnstone, a member of the Scottish parliament’s equal opportunities committee. He said: ‘There’s been a substantial trend in recent years away from supporting traditional marriage as a basis for the raising of children and providing the cornerstone for society as a whole. ‘At a time when we should have been looking for ways to underpin and reinforce marriage on that basis we seem to be obsessed with pursuing what I believe is an unjustified desire to provide same-sex marriage, so I think it is a step in the wrong direction as far as the support of marriage in society is concerned.’ However, Scottish Tory deputy leader Jackson Carlaw said he would support the Bill – while ensuring that any amendments can provide full protection to religions, faiths and congregations which don’t want to take part. Colin Beattie, Nationalist MSP for Midlothian North and Musselburgh, said: ‘I don’t think the case for making it different for gay people holds much water: everyone should be equal. ‘I’m concerned about the people who are against but if you are a parliamentarian you have to deal with hard facts and logic on whether something should become law and it is hard to take into account religious views on that basis.’ A Scottish Government spokesman said: ‘The Scottish Government is committed to a Scotland that is fair and equal and that is why we believe that same sex couples who wish should be allowed to marry as soon as possible.’","86 out of 127 politicians in Holyrood say they will vote to pass legislation .

"By . Neil Sears . and Stephen Johns . and Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . A London state school where most children are brought up with English as a foreign language offers a better education than the private school attended by Princes William and Harry just around the corner, Michael Gove claimed today. The Education Secretary vowed to ‘break down the Berlin wall’ between state and private schools to drive up standards. And he claimed the Thomas Jones primary school in West London is now better than the £17,460-a-year Wertherby Prep-School which taught the heirs to the throne. Prince William and Prince Harry in April 1990 being dropped off by mother Diana at Wetherby school, which Education Secretary Michael Goves says is now matched by nearby state schools . Thomas Jones Primary School in Notting Hill, West London, is regularly cited by politicians for its strong performance in a tough area . In speech to the London Academy of Excellence today, Mr Gove said the evidence shows ‘beyond any reasonable doubt’ that English state education is starting to show a ‘sustained and significant improvement’. He said state schools could become the best in the world by tapping into the expertise of the independent sector. But he went further in claiming that Wetherby school in particular may already have been overtaken by nearby state schools teaching much poorer pupils. William and Harry both attended the prep school in Notting Hill in the 1980s before taking up places at Eton. Other former Wetherby pupils include Downing Abbey creator Lord Fellowes, composer Lord Lloyd Webber and actor Hugh Grant. Mr Gove said he wanted to make it impossible to tell if a school is private or state-run . Mr Gove insisted that the expensive and exclusive education on offer there was now matched by state schools ‘every bit as good as excellent private schools’. He added: ‘There are state primary schools every bit as ambitious, as supportive, as exciting, as the smartest of private prep schools. ‘Like, for example, Thomas Jones primary in West London – a school with a majority of children eligible for free school meals during the last six years, a majority coming from homes where English is not their first language – which is just as good, if not better, than the pre-eminent London prep - Wetherby school - just a mile or so away. ‘Under the changes we're making, it’s becoming easier for state schools to match the offer from private schools. ‘Instead of reinforcing the Berlin Wall between state and private, as the current Labour leadership appear to want, we should break it down.’ Mr Gove was speaking at the London . Academy of Excellence, a new free school in Newham, East London, which . has managed to secure places in Oxford and Cambridge for six of its . pupils – the same number achieved last year by Millfield, an independent . school that charges annual fees of up to £32,385. The Education Secretary also wants state schools to make pupils sit the ‘robust’ Common Entrance exam used by leading private schools and subject them to old-fashioned classroom discipline. He suggests that all 13-year-olds should study for the 100-year-old test to indicate how well they are ‘performing against some of the top schools around the world’. Mr Gove argues that it is wrong that between national curriculum tests at age 11 and GCSEs at 16, children have no formal, externally assessed examinations. Founded in 1951, it was originally in upmarket Wetherby Place before moving to Pembridge Square in 1971. Former pupils include Prince William, Prince Harry, Hugh Grant, Lord Lloyd Webber. Uniform: Grey and red blazers and caps . Number of pupils: 244 . Age of pupils: 4-8 . Gender of pupils: Boys . Fees: £17,460-a-year . Named after a 19th century campaigner against slavery from North Carolina, twothirds of pupils use English as an additional language, and one third of these speak Arabic as their first language. Uniform: Blue sweatshirts and cardigans . Number of pupils: 235 . Gender of pupils: Mixed . Age of pupils: 3-11 . Fees: £0 . Mr Gove wants state school pupils to take the exams used by private schools to drive up standards . He also urged head teachers to go further by adopting traditional methods of discipline. New guidance being sent to schools today sets out suggested punishments for misbehaving students, including being sent for a run around a playing field, picking up litter or writing out hundreds of lines. It also suggests that detentions can be issued at lunchtime, after school or weekends, with no notice for parents. Mr Gove said that his ambition for the education system is ‘simple... when you visit a school in England, standards are so high all round that you should not be able to tell whether it’s in the state sector or a fee-paying independent’. He argued that the state education system is ‘starting to show a sustained and significant improvement’. But he warned schools must go further – setting out his proposal for 13-year-olds to sit the Common Entrance exam. ‘Privately educated children often benefit from rigorous testing of ability – and, crucially, knowledge – at regular points throughout their school career,’ Mr Gove said. ‘But since the last Labour government abolished tests for 14-year-olds, we have had no rigorous externally set and marked measures of progress for students in the first five years of secondary school. ‘It is often during this period that performance dips and students suffer. ‘I am open to arguments about how we can improve performance – and assessment – in this critical period. 'But there is already one widely available, robust and effective test of knowledge for just this age group: the Common Entrance test papers. ‘They are designed for 13-year-olds – they are used by private schools to ensure students are on track for later success – they are already available on the web, and are a fantastic resource. ‘So I want state schools to try out Common Entrance exams – giving them a chance to check how well they and their pupils are performing against some of the top schools around the world.’ There is, however, no suggestion that taking the Common Entrance test will provide a path into private schools. On discipline, Mr Gove said every head in the state sector must have the ability to ensure children behave as ‘impeccably as in the most successful state and private schools’. He added: ‘That means giving heads the power to ensure there is exemplary behaviour – and giving teachers the power to keep control in the classroom and the playground. 'Because without excellent behaviour, no child can learn – and a tiny minority of disruptive children can absorb almost all of teachers’ time and attention, in effect holding the education of the rest hostage. ‘So we have given teachers more freedoms to keep control in the classroom, and to discipline pupils for misbehaviour. ‘We trust the professionalism of our teachers. So we’ve given them the tools to keep control of their classrooms, and allow every student to learn in peace.’ Exams will test how pupils are getting along compared to other schools, and will not be used to give out places . The Department for Education said while current guidelines make clear the legal backing for setting school punishments, they fail to outline potential sanctions, leaving many heads and teachers unclear of what action they can take. Mr Gove also suggested he wanted to see more state schools offer extra-curricular activities to extend the school day to fit in with the lives of working parents. He said he did not support shorter holidays but said free schools and academies could vary term dates to allow parents to avoid the expense of holidaying during rigidly fixed half terms and other holidays.","Education Secretary says state school now better than Wetherby prep .

"By . Richard Spillett . Prison: Graeme Gordon was jailed for abusing a 14-year-old girl he groomed over the internet and has also been struck off the nursing register . A children's hospital nurse who abused a 14-year-old schoolgirl he groomed on the internet has been struck off the nursing register. Graeme Gordon, 36, was a trusted nurse at the Royal Alexandra Children's Hospital in Brighton, East Sussex, where he worked for nine years. But he was jailed for three years and two months after a judge heard that he took a girl to a hotel where they spent the night and he sexually abused her. Gordon's double life was revealed this week at a disciplinary hearing which banned him from working as a nurse. He admitted three offences relating to sexual activity with a child under 16, grooming of a child for the purposes of sexual activity and possession of indecent images relating to children when he appeared at Reading Crown Court earlier this year. He has now been struck off the Nursing and Midwifery Council's register after the panel concluded his fitness to practice had been impaired. An investigation into his crimes by Thames Valley Police found no evidence he had carried out any criminal activity at his work. The 14-year-old involved was not a patient at the hospital. Gordon, formerly of Brighton, was sacked by Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust immediately after his arrest. He was not present at the conduct and competence committee meeting of the Nursing and Midwifery Council on Friday. The panel heard he is a prisoner at Bullingdon prison in Bicester, Oxfordshire. The panel concluded: 'Mr Gordon's actions were significant departures from the standards expected of a registered nurse and are fundamentally incompatible with him remaining on the register. Gordon, who was working at the Royal Alexandra Children's Hospital in Brighton (pictured) at the time the offences were committed, has now been struck off the nursing register by the Nursing and Midwifery Council . 'The panel was of the view that the findings in this particular case demonstrate that Mr Gordon's actions were serious and to allow him to continue practising would undermine public confidence in the profession and in the Nursing and Midwifery Council as a regulatory body.' Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Chief executive Matthew Kershaw said: 'As soon as we received news of the charges against him we dismissed him from our employment. 'The police found absolutely no evidence or even suggestion that Graeme Gordon's offending behaviour involved his place of work. 'They also found no evidence that any of his colleagues were aware of his offending behaviour, they received no complaints about his work and there was no history or suggestion of previous offences. 'At the time of his arrest we informed all the appropriate authorities.'","Graeme Gordon was working at Royal Alexandra hospital in Brighton at time .

"By . Richard Spillett . Sabrina Hirst was jailed for the manslaughter of her daughter, Tiffany Wright, in 2008 but has since been freed to start a new life, it emerged today . A killer mother who let her three-year-old daughter die malnourished and alone  was allowed out of prison just four years after she was jailed for 12 years, it emerged today. Sabrina Hirst allowed little Tiffany Wright to die in a squalid bedroom and, according to the judge who sentenced her, seemed to care more about her dogs than her daughter. Despite being sentenced to 12 years for Tiffany's manslaughter in 2008, Hirst was allowed out just four years later and even visited Downing Street while on day release, it was reported today. Tiffany had been dead for about two days when she was found in a room above the Scarborough Arms in Upperthorpe, Sheffield in 2007. Police were called after a pub disco ended on a Sunday night and it emerged Hirst had not checked on the youngster since the previous Friday morning. Police and paramedics found the little girl in a filthy bed in a beetle-infested room, her body covered in insect bites 'looking like a porcelain doll with sunken eyes', a court later heard. Hirst admitted responsibility for the death and was jailed in 2008 for what trial judge, Recorder Alan Goldsack QC, called 'about as bad a case of child manslaughter as there can be'. It emerged this morning that Hirst - who has since changed her name to Adelle Shaw - was allowed out on day release just four years later. She was then freed on licence in 2013 after serving half of her sentence, after time she had spent on remand before trial was taken into account. The Sun reported that, after hooking up with new boyfriend, RAF airman Rob Donnison,  she was even admitted to Downing Street to have her picture taken outside the famous door of Number 10. Tiffany Wright was found dead in a beetle-infested room in 2007. Hirst had not checked on her for two days . It is believed the couple got through security at the famous street using Mr Donnison's military ID. The paper reported Hirst now works for a youth support charity in London, where she commutes from her home in Lincoln. Former friends told the paper her early release was a 'disgrace' and claimed she is fooling people with her new life. At Hirst's trial in 2008, prosecutor Jeremy Richardson QC said: 'Tiffany had not been seen for about a week by anyone other than her mother before her body was discovered. Much of the time her mother didn't feed Tiffany properly or at all.' The judge told her: 'One almost unbelievable piece of evidence is that on what was probably Tiffany's last day alive, you were discussing on the phone concerns you had about one of your dog's weight and feeding problems.' A pathologist said Tiffany's bones showed evidence of significant periods of malnutrition between periods when she had been fed. Following the publication of the photo of Hirst in Downing Street, a spokesman for the Prime Minister said: 'Members of the armed forces and their families can request to have their photos taken outside Number 10. This is at the discretion of police officers on the gate, during quiet periods. 'Military identification must be shown before access is granted and all visitors are subject to strict security checks before entering. Visitors on this basis are not permitted to enter the building.' A photo showing Hirst outside Number 10 Downing Street while on day release emerged today.

"By . Richard Spillett . Most footballers spend their whole careers dreaming of getting their hands on it. But it seems that, for one of Germany's players, the joy of finally holding the famous World Cup trophy was all too much. The head of the German FA revealed yesterday that the gold trophy was damaged during his team's wild celebrations after they beat Argentina in the tournament's final earlier this month. German forward Andre Schurrle lifts the famous trophy, a replica of which was later damaged by his team . German stars Kevin Grosskreutz (left) and Mesut Ozil (right) celebrate with the trophy after the World Cup Final . Captain Philip Lahm led the team in jubilant scenes after the Germans won football's most famous competition for the first time since 1990 in Brazil's Maracana stadium. But the president of the country's football association, Wolfgang Niersbach, said a piece of the famous gold trophy was later 'chipped off' as the players showed it to fans back home. He told Die Welt: 'At one point, a small piece of our World Cup trophy was chipped off. But do not worry, we have specialists on the case who can fix it. 'We have investigated persistently who it was that damaged the trophy, but the investigation was concluded without a result.' The trophy, designed by Italian artist Silvio Gazzaniga, was introduced in 1974 and the 5kg original, made from 75 per cent 18 carat gold, is said to be worth around £8million. The trophy is believed to have been damaged as the team toured German capital Berlin on an open-top bus . The head of the German FA said an investigation was launched but it was unclear who had caused the damage . Luckily for Germany however, the trophy they were given to parade around Berlin was a replica given to them by football's governing body, Fifa. The current trophy replaced the famous Jules Rimet trophy, which was given to Brazil after they won it for a third time at the 1970 World Cup. The previous trophy was stolen during a public exhibition at Westminster Central Hall ahead of the 1966 World Cup in England. It was then famously found by a dog named Pickles under a bush in Norwood, south London before England went on to win the tournament.","Team won famous trophy after beating Argentina in Brazil World Cup Final .

"By . Richard Spillett . Fish and chip shops have been told to check their stock for shark meat after the gruesome discovery of scores of carcasses on the Isle of Wight. A resident of the island was left horrified after stumbling across a mound of severed heads and fins of  smooth-hound sharks, which are completely harmless to humans. After a picture of his shocking find appeared on Facebook, government officials have urged chip shops to ensure they know what they are selling. Isle of Wight resident Kevin Parker took this picture after discovering more than 50 carcasses near Cowes . Conservationists have called for catch limits on the amount of small-hound sharks that can be landed . Shark meat is often used in pet food and fish meal but can also be passed off as huss or rock salmon, which are sold in takeaways around Britain. It is thought an unlicensed trawler may have landed the sharks, before their valueless heads and fins were cut off, leaving only the meat. Kevin Parker, who found the remains of what he estimates at more than 50 of the animals, said local residents had been shocked by what had been found. He told MailOnline: 'I'm a fisherman myself but everyone I know throws them back alive when they catch them because they are of no real value and are falling in numbers. I think it must have been someone doing it illegally. Smooth-hound sharks are found throughout the eastern Atlantic Ocean. While they can grow to 200cm in size, they are usually around 150cm long. Despite being related to more ferocious creatures, smooth-hounds rarely even attack other fish and live off crabs and shellfish found on the sea-bed. Rather than the typical razor-sharp teeth associated with their relations, the smooth-hound has much blunter crushing plates which are adapted to help them eat the crustaceans which make up the majority of their diet. Smooth-hound are generally caught on a strict 'catch-and-release' basis by British anglers and killing one, according to one fishing website, is 'simply not the done thing'. After being classed as 'vulnerable', the common smooth-hound's plight has recently been compared to the polar bear by marine biologists. 'I was disgusted to see them all just discarded like that and everyone around here is really angry about it. It was especially sad to see that many of those killed were just young pups. How are they supposed to breed if even the young ones are being killed?' The Food Standards Agency, which monitors the quality of food in restaurants and shops, has since issued guidance to anyone selling fish. A spokesman said: 'Fish must be what it claims to be on the label or the menu and food businesses must make sure they buy their fish from reputable sources.' Conservationists are also concerned because the smooth-hound species has been classified as 'vulnerable' by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Richard Peirce, chairman of the Shark Trust, warned that fishing for sharks is becoming increasingly common in British waters. After viewing a photo of the latest find, he said: 'I'm always disappointed at the waste of vulnerable or endangered species.' He called for limits on how many sharks fisherman can land in a bid to stop the rising numbers being caught. Holidaymakers find dozens of dead sharks washed up on British beach after being scooped up by trawler then dumped . Marine experts have been left outraged after 70 dead sharks were found washed up on a British beach. The 'perfectly healthy' sharks are thought to have been scooped up by a trawler then illegally dumped over the side. The dead smooth-hounds and catsharks were found by holidaymakers on a remote beach on the Gower coastline of South Wales. It is thought the creatures were caught by a fishing trawler before being dumped over the side of the boat . Marine biologist Judith Oakley blamed 'indiscriminate bottom trawling' for the grim find. She said: 'It was horrific - I wandered along the beach in total disbelief. There were several varieties of small shark lying dead on the sand and over the rocks. 'I counted 55 but there were a lot more - I have never seen such a terrible sight here in Britain. There are always grim reminders of why I am so passionate about marine wildlife and protecting it.' Mrs Oakley believes the sharks are victims of industrial scale bottom trawling - where boats use a large net with heavy weights to drag the seafloor and scoop up everything in its path. She thinks the sharks were caught in the nets but then dumped back into the sea because they have no commercial value. The dead sharks were found at Pwll Du Bay near Swansea but it is feared hundreds more may have been washed up on nearby rocks and inaccessible beaches. The animals have little commercial value and a marine biologist thinks they were victims of 'industrial trawling'","Island resident finds more than 50 severed heads and fins on shore .

"By . Richard Spillett . Michael Adebowale has won the right to appeal the life sentence he was given for the murder of Lee Rigby . One of Lee Rigby's killers has been given the right to appeal against his life sentence due to mental health problems. Michael Adebowale, 22, was given a 45-year minimum term for murdering the soldier in Woolwich last year in an attack which shocked Britain. It was confirmed this morning that the 22-year-old will now be allowed to appeal against his punishment after he was transferred to Broadmoor Hospital. Adebowale was jailed alongside Michael Adebolajo, 29, in February after the pair ran over Fusilier Lee Rigby in a car before attacking him with knives and a meat cleaver. Adebolajo was given a whole-life sentence, meaning he will never be released from prison. Adebowale had been serving the first months of his prison term at Belmarsh high-security prison in south-east London. But he was moved to a mental health unit at Broadmoor two weeks ago after reportedly 'hearing voices' and suffering 'psychotic episodes'. It emerged this morning that, because of his mental health, he will now be able to appeal against his sentence in a bid to win an early release. After being told of Adebowale's prison transfer on what would have been the day after Drummer Rigby's 27th birthday, his family have branded the latest decision 'a joke' His mother, Lyn, told The Sun the protracted legal case meant the 'heartache never stops' for her and makes it 'impossible' to grieve. A judicial spokesman today confirmed the appeal would go ahead, but said a date for the hearing at London's Royal Courts of Justice has not yet been arranged. Father-of-one Lee Rigby was just 25 when he was brutally murdered as he walked back to his barracks in Woolwich on May 22 last year. Sentencing Adebowale and Adebolajo after their trial, Mr Justice Sweeney said: '[Lee Rigby] had done absolutely nothing to deserve what you did to him.' He said the pair created 'a bloodbath', adding: 'You both gloried in what you had done.' Father-of-one Lee Rigby died after he was attacked as he returned to his barracks in Woolwich last May . Drummer Rigby's mother, Lyn, has hit out at the decision, which she said 'makes it impossible to grieve'","Michael Adebowale is serving minimum 45-year sentence for the murder .
